The leading decentralized computing network transferred 4,850 ETH from one of its associated wallets to top liquid exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. Binance Receives 3,800 Ethereum Noteworthy, the developer team working on the project performed the transfers to the two exchanges in nine separate transactions. All the transactions occurred on February 20 between 15:46 (UTC) and 18:19 (UTC). ETH traded at $2,818.08 at press time after recording a 3.26% increase within the last 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap data. This price level sums the computing network’s Ethereum dumping to over $13.6 million. A major portion of the assets went to Richard Teng-led Binance . The digital asset service provider received up to 3,800 ETH, worth $10.7 million. Blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence claimed that the other 1,050 ETH, valued at approximately $2.9 million, was moved to a Coinbase wallet address. No ETH Dump, Just Solo Staking With CEX Five months ago, the Ethereum ICO participant moved 2,000 ETH to the American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase in five transactions. Markedly, this was the last time that the project made such a transfer to a centralized exchange. At the time, users were concerned about CEX’s involvement in a solo staking process. In response, Golem Network explained to these concerned users that it wasn’t dumping the second-largest cryptocurrency by market. Instead, it claimed that the transfers were all part of a staking test to ensure operational security. “Our objective was to create a controlled environment where we could monitor the impact of various factors on the staking-related processes,” the team wrote. Golem Network’s ETH Dump Could Trigger Selling Pressure Historically, such huge transfers of tokens to exchanges are usually followed by sales into USDT. At other times, they are swapped to other digital assets. Whatever the case, a sell-off of this size could trigger market pressure and a downtrend in the price of ETH. However, this is highly dependent on the speed of liquidation. Though yet to be confirmed, Ethereum allegedly saw a sharp plunge around the time of the nine transactions from Golem to Binance and Coinbase. From trading around $2,764 an hour before the transaction, the ETH price went down to $2,708 just a few minutes after the first set of funds moved to Binance. Judging by the current price of the altcoin, there has been some price recovery for Ethereum.

In stark contrast, Web3Bay harnesses blockchain technology to forge a decentralized, peer-to-peer marketplace free from such constraints. This model abolishes the need for intermediaries, enabling direct interactions between buyers and sellers. This not only drastically cuts transaction fees—typically between 10% to 15% on conventional platforms—but also enhances profit margins for sellers and reduces costs for buyers. Moreover, the security and transparency of transactions are bolstered by smart contracts, eliminating fraud risks without the need for third-party verification. Momentum & Market Potential of Web3Bay’s Presale The Web3Bay 3BAY token presale is capturing significant investor interest, a testament to the growing confidence in decentralized commerce solutions. As of February, the initiative has garnered over $1.5 million and distributed nearly 370 million tokens over four stages. With the token currently priced at $0.004562625, its value is projected to climb through 28 stages to a potential launch price of $0.1959, promising a substantial return on investment of up to 6000% for early investors. The presale’s success is not isolated but reflects a broader shift towards blockchain integrations across sectors like finance, gaming, and now, e-commerce. Investors are drawn to Web3Bay’s potential for low-cost, autonomously governed, and user-directed trade, positioning it as a formidable alternative to established market leaders. Challenges & Forward-Looking Perspective for Decentralized E-Commerce Despite the allure of its zero-fee and self-governed model, Web3Bay confronts significant hurdles, including user and merchant onboarding, competition from entrenched players, and the need for seamless integration with existing cryptocurrency payment systems. The platform’s ability to attract a critical mass of users and provide a frictionless shopping experience will be crucial. Nevertheless, the increasing consumer and vendor disillusionment with traditional e-commerce behemoths, coupled with the rising demand for more equitable, blockchain-based systems, points to a promising trajectory for Web3Bay. Should it fulfill its strategic promises, Web3Bay is poised to challenge the dominance of Amazon and eBay, potentially revolutionizing online shopping with its blockchain-centric approach.

Each of these tokens has exhibited impressive momentum, attracting retail and institutional investors eager to capitalize on the next big breakout. While SUI and BONK have already made waves in the market, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is emerging as a powerful competitor, driven by AI integration and a record-breaking presale event. Analysts are weighing in on which project has the strongest fundamentals and growth potential to win this crypto race. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The AI Meme Coin Set To Win The Crypto Race To $5 As the 2025 crypto race continues, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is set to outshine SUI and BONK with its AI-powered ecosystem and rapid presale growth. While many meme coins rely on speculation, FloppyPepe (FPPE) combines artificial intelligence, passive income rewards, and a burn mechanism to create a high-value, long-term investment. Analysts predict that FloppyPepe (FPPE) will first surge past $5 and become the next breakout star in the crypto space. FloppyPepe (FPPE) allows traders to approach the volatile market with confidence with its AI-driven predictive model. Its AI video agent provides real-time market insights to help traders make well-informed decisions. Additionally, the upcoming AI text-to-image feature , set to launch on its Telegram community channel in just a week, enables users to monetize AI-generated content. FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers investors multiple ways to earn passive income and long-term rewards. Every transaction redistributes 3% back to token holders to guarantee steady earnings while promoting long-term investment. Its burn mechanism reduces supply to drive price appreciation. With stage-based pricing structures already delivering impressive returns, early adopters stand to gain massively as the token surges toward $5. Also, the network completed a smart audit with SolidProof to guarantee the platform’s freedom from scam attacks and bugs. As momentum builds ahead of the 2025 bull run, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is gaining traction at an astonishing rate. This meme coin extends its impact beyond the crypto market by allocating some of its revenue to wildlife conservation efforts . At its current entry price of just $0.0000002 , investors have a rare opportunity to secure their positions before FloppyPepe (FPPE) outpaces SUI and BONK to hit the $5 milestone. As a forward-thinking project, FloppyPepe (FPPE) recorded over $900,000 inflow in its private round. This approach shows that this AI-powered memecoin is a forward-thinking crypto project. A popular YouTuber with over a million subscribers, NASS Crypto, has backed this AI meme coin to reach unprecedented heights in the coming years. These numbers show confidence in its formidable network and its potential charge. Sui (SUI) and Bonk (BONK) Gear Up For The Next Bull Run Analysts have begun to weigh in ahead of the next bull run. Having observed their performances, they are certain that FloppyPepe (FPPE) will outperform SUI and Bonk (BONK) . Despite trading above $3, the recent whale sell-off shows that investors have low confidence in SUI. Bonk (BONK), on the other hand, has received predictions for 20-25x growth in the next bull run. However, these gains pale in comparison to FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) astronomical ROIs. Why Expert Sentiments Favor FloppyPepe (FPPE) While SUI and BONK have shown strong market performances, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is quickly proving to be the ultimate contender in the crypto race to $5. Unlike its rivals, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is backed by cutting-edge AI integration, a thriving community, and a presale event that has already shattered expectations. Its blend of advanced technology and meme culture gives it a competitive edge over SUI and BONK. With analysts predicting exponential growth and investors rushing to secure their positions early, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is emerging as the most promising token to reach the $5 milestone first. As excitement builds around its AI-driven ecosystem and market demand skyrockets, early adopters stand to reap the most rewards.

Cardano has long been viewed as one of the most promising blockchain projects, but its recent performance has sparked concern. With slow development progress and growing competition from newer, faster blockchains, traders are looking beyond Cardano for fresh opportunities. And one altcoin that’s capturing attention is PropiChain (PCHAIN) ; a project that combines blockchain with real-world applications and is showing strong bullish momentum. Cardano Price Struggles While Investors Look Elsewhere The Cardano price has been struggling to break out, frustrating investors who once believed in its potential to revolutionize blockchain technology. One of the main challenges has been the slow rollout of key updates, such as smart contract improvements and scalability solutions. While Cardano remains a technically advanced blockchain, its slower adoption compared to networks like Solana and Ethereum has dampened investor enthusiasm. So investors, who were once eager to support projects like Cardano, are being more cautious with their allocations. As the Cardano price action remains unpredictable, smart investors are exploring projects with clear utility and strong growth potential like PropiChain . Why PropiChain Is Attracting Attention While the Cardano price fluctuates, PropiChain is gaining momentum for all the right reasons. The project is built to solve real-world problems, particularly in real estate investment, which has traditionally been difficult for the average person to access. With PropiChain, investors can own a share of high-value properties without needing massive amounts of capital. For example, instead of requiring millions of dollars to buy a commercial property, investors can purchase fractional shares using blockchain-based tokens. This allows people to benefit from property appreciation and rental income, just like traditional real estate investors; but with significantly lower entry costs. Another key feature is AI-powered market insights, which help investors make better decisions. Instead of guessing which property or virtual asset will increase in value, PropiChain’s AI tools analyze market trends and provide recommendations based on data. This gives investors a competitive advantage, making it easier to identify high-growth opportunities before the broader market catches on. Additionally, the tokenization ensures that property ownership is secure and easily transferable. By converting real estate into blockchain-based tokens, transactions become seamless, cutting out intermediaries and unnecessary fees because these tokenized assets can be traded effortlessly. PropiChain also provides global accessibility, allowing anyone, anywhere, to invest in real estate markets that were previously out of reach. This means a person in Asia could invest in a high-growth real estate market in Europe, all through a decentralized and secure blockchain platform. On top of that, PropiChain is integrating with the metaverse, allowing users to buy and sell digital real estate. As virtual economies grow, owning property in the metaverse could be just as valuable as physical assets. PropiChain is positioning itself at the forefront of this shift, giving investors multiple avenues for growth. Market Validation and Security Assurance While many blockchain projects struggle to gain legitimacy, PropiChain is proving itself through security audits and market recognition. A third-party security audit confirmed that PropiChain’s smart contracts are robust and free of vulnerabilities. This gives investors confidence that their funds are protected from potential exploits; an important factor in today’s crypto space. Additionally, PropiChain has been listed on CoinMarketCap , a key milestone that enhances its credibility and visibility in the market. This listing signals to investors that PropiChain is a serious contender, drawing attention from both retail and institutional players. The Opportunity: How Much Can Investors Gain? With Cardano price failing to show clear bullish signals, many investors are shifting their focus to PropiChain , where momentum is building fast. The project is currently in stage 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at just $0.011 each. A $1,000 investment at the current price could yield $330,000 in 2025 if PropiChain sees the massive surge analysts are predicting. A Strategic Shift from Cardano to PropiChain While Cardano price remains uncertain, investors are pivoting toward projects with clearer upside potential. PropiChain is proving to be one of the most promising blockchain investments available today. With its low presale price of $0.011, early investors have a rare chance to position themselves for exponential returns before the market fully catches on. For those searching for the next big investment opportunity, PropiChain could be the altcoin that delivers life-changing gains in 2025.

The data reveals that Chainlink ( LINK ) rival Pyth Network ( PYTH ) and AI-based projects Kaito ( KAITO ) and Bittensor ( TAO ) all saw significant increases in price after gaining support from Coinbase. KAITO – an “InfoAI” protocol that aims to solve the problem of fragmentation within the digital assets industry – was recently listed by both Coinbase and the top global crypto exchange by volume Binance en route to nearly doubling up its price. Kaito is trading for $1.92 at time of writing, a staggering 99.89% rise during the last 24 hours. Moving on to the decentralized machine-learning network Bittensor, an open-source platform that allows investors to create and swap AI learning models, the data finds that TAO also saw a significant increase in price but eventually stabilized. TAO skyrocketed from a low of $445 to a peak of $484, a rise of 8.7%, in just a few hours after gaining support from Coinbase. The digital asset has since retraced and is moving for $453 at time of writing. Moving on to PYTH, the data shows the oracle provider also saw an increase in price after being listed followed by a subsequent retrace. On February 20th, PYTH jumped from a price of $0.235 to $0.263, a 12% increase. It was since retraced and is trading for $0.243 at time of writing.

Amid the uncertainty of whether GBP/USD and USD/CAD could continue to post gains, investors and other market participants have recognized a new meme coin named Panshibi (SHIBI). They believe SHIBI’s market potential of minting over 45,000% profits this year makes the token unavoidably the best crypto to buy. What’s the new meme coin about? And could Nasdaq hit $100? Let’s break it down. GBP/USD Outlook GBP/USD currency pair has experienced highs and lows, rising to 1.2670 in the early hours of Friday. The GBP/USD pair gained strength against the U.S. dollar, though, as it lost ground following dismal jobless claims data and mixed signals from the Federal Reserve (Fed). The GBP/USD currency pair posted gains on the back of improved market conditions after President Trump made remarks about potential breakthroughs in trade negotiations with China. However, caution remains in the air for the GBP/USD currency pair among traders due to the UK. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey’s warnings. With these conflicting signals, the GBP/USD pair may see further volatility in the next few weeks as traders watch both U.S. and U.K. economic reports closely to determine the pair’s direction. USD/CAD Might Stall Its Recovery The USD/CAD pair tanked in the Thursday North American session to 1.42. The decline of the USD/CAD pair was largely due to weakness in the U.S. currency, reflected in the decline of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) to 106.70. Despite an announcement from US President Donald Trump that new auto, chip, and pharmaceutical tariffs could become effective within the next month, the USD could not recover. However, the USD/CAD pair did rebound somewhat after dropping earlier in the week. The USD/CAD pair seems to have received a fresh supply for now, but this might stall its recovery. Trading activity around the USD/CAD is expected to slow down within the next 48 hours as the Bank of Canada (BoC) may rethink cutting rates. Could Nasdaq Hit $100? Nasdaq (NDAQ) is a global financial technology, trading, and market infrastructure provider. With a market cap of $47.6 billion. With a pegged price per stock of $82.54, the Nasdaq stock price has already risen above 5% this year. Market activity from TradingView suggests that Nasdaq is building upside momentum, and analysts are now more bullish on the stock than they were two months ago. Based on this growth potential, the possibility of Nasdaq hitting $100 per share might not be too far away. Panshibi: The Best Crypto to Buy Today Panshibi is undoubtedly one of the best crypto to buy on the market today. This meme coin has a Panda as its mascot, which was inspired by Asian culture. The community of this appealing project spans from memecoin enthusiasts, Panda lovers from every corner of the world, and, of course, Asians. The Panshibi community might be rapidly growing, but the Bamboo Valley could still accommodate even more. One aspect of Panshibi’s philosophy that investors cannot ignore is its fight against the corrupt financial higher-ups who have exploited hundreds of thousands of market participants. Panshibi keeps them safe in Bamboo Valley and gives them the power to revolt against corruption. Talk about Panshibi’s plan for Pandas. Many in the crypto community have embraced Panshibi’s interests, so it’s no surprise that the number of people in Bamboo Valley keeps increasing every day. Once the project is listed on the biggest exchanges, industry experts predict gains of up to 45,000%. SHIBI could possibly be the best crypto to buy today, selling at only $0.005 per token.

The stock is nearing a 14% weekly decline after dropping as much as 17%. On February 12, the trading platform reported exceptional fourth-quarter earnings, with revenue more than doubling. This contributed to a remarkable 162% surge in its stock price from November 5, following Trump’s election, through the end of last week. However, Citigroup Inc. and Wolfe Research LLC analysts noted that much of the company’s earnings growth potential was already reflected in the stock’s valuation. As a result, Wolfe’s Steven Chubak downgraded the stock from a buy rating to a hold-equivalent. “We had recommended to our clients that they take some chips off the table at a $60 to $70 share price,” Chubak said. The downgrade is a wake-up call to investors to be “more forensic” over the company’s potential. Crypto-fuelled growth after Trump’s elections spurred Robinhood stock Robinhood experienced serious growth, more than 700% in crypto revenue during the fourth quarter. During the same period, Bitcoin traded above $100,000 as people speculated that Trump would support digital assets. In an email, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev explained that the pullback stemmed from concerns that the “animal spirits” driving the company’s strong fourth-quarter performance may not persist. However, he remains optimistic about the stock, citing ongoing tailwinds from digital assets and a growing user base on the trading platform. Dolev isn’t the only one with a bullish outlook. Nearly three-quarters of analysts tracked by Bloomberg rate the stock as a buy, with an average 12-month price target of $70.76—slightly above its 2021 record high. Still, Chubak cautioned that a rebound is not assured, pointing to industry data that indicates a decline in crypto activity so far this quarter. Chubak said he would not be surprised if the stock continued declining in a weaker crypto activity environment. Robinhood plans to expand to Singapore According to a Bloomberg report, Robinhood plans to introduce cryptocurrency trading products in Singapore through its Bitstamp subsidiary. While the online brokerage has not yet announced a launch date, it aims to begin rolling out services by late 2025. The report cited an interview with Johann Kerbrat, Robinhood Crypto’s vice president and general manager, highlighting Bitstamp’s existing licenses in Singapore as a key factor in the acquisition. “Part of the reason why Bitstamp was attractive was because of their licenses with Singapore and its institutional business,” Kerbrat reportedly told Bloomberg. Robinhood agreed to acquire Bitstamp in June last year for $200 million, a move intended to expand its reach among institutional crypto investors in the US and internationally. Bloomberg also noted that Bitstamp received in-principle approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore last year. The acquisition is expected to close this year, pending regulatory approval.

The exchange confirmed that law enforcement is involved, and forensic teams are working to demix hacker addresses to limit how the funds can be sold. Bybit announced the development on X, saying : “We have reported the case to the appropriate authorities and we will send an update as soon as we have any further information. We have fortunately worked quickly and extensively with on-chain analytics providers to identify and demix the implicated addresses. These actions will mitigate and counter the ability of bad actors in disposing and dumping the ETH on the markets via legitimate marketplace narrowing the available outlets of disposal.” CEO responds as Bybit fights to control the fallout Bybit’s CEO, Ben Zhou, responded within 30 minutes of the first reports of the hack. He confirmed that the 401,000 ETH had been drained from Bybit’s cold wallet but assured users that the exchange remained fully operational. Zhou followed up with a livestream on X and YouTube, where he answered questions in real time. “We are handling withdrawals as usual,” he told users. “Retail withdrawals are being prioritized, and we are processing thousands of requests per hour.” Bybit’s transparency helped keep panic under control, with Zhou assuring traders that Bybit’s reserves were 1:1 backed and that no funds were frozen. The hack targeted Bybit’s Gnosis Safe multisig wallets, which Zhou admitted was the point of failure. Bybit has since revoked compromised access, but the damage was already done. The hacker, later linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group, executed the attack through exploited multisig processes. Bybit confirmed that 4,000 withdrawals were pending immediately after the breach, but Zhou said the exchange secured a bridge loan to maintain smooth operations. “We are processing every withdrawal request as fast as possible,” he said. “The attack was significant, but it does not impact Bybit’s financial health.” Bybit didn’t just report the hack—it took the fight straight to the hackers. Zhou made it clear that selling the stolen ETH would be extremely difficult, as Bybit had already flagged and blacklisted the wallets involved. On-chain analyst ZachXBT was the first to link the Bybit exploit to Lazarus Group, the North Korean hacking unit known for previous high-profile attacks. ZachXBT confirmed that Bybit’s case matched patterns seen in past Phemex and Atomic Wallet hacks. Bybit also turned to its partners, exchanges, and market makers like Binance and Bitget to prevent the stolen ETH from moving, so they’ve now blacklisted the wallets. Unlike when FTX needed help during its 2022 collapse, where crypto exchange distanced themselves, Bybit’s industry connections rallied around the exchange. Bybit took a direct approach with Lazarus , knowing they were likely watching the livestream, and Zhou repeatedly told them that moving the funds would be impossible and urged them to negotiate. Bybit then told its users that: “We want to assure our users and partners that all other Bybit cold wallets remain fully secure. All client funds are safe, and our operations continue as usual without any disruption. Transparency and security remain our top priorities, and we will provide updates asap.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",News|Bybit,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|ETH|MARKET|ASIA|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-21 23:12:10

Senate Committee to Debate Crypto Rules, Bitcoin Reserve Proposal According to the announcement , Tim Scott, the Republican senator from South Carolina who is now leading the committee, has expressed strong support for the crypto sector, raising hopes for more constructive discussions this time. Industry representatives, including legal experts from Kraken and Lightspark, are expected to provide insights on what regulatory frameworks could foster innovation and economic growth in the space. The session will be held in a hybrid format and will feature testimony from key industry figures, including Lewis Cohen, partner at Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP; Jonathan Jachym, Deputy General Counsel and Global Head of Policy & Government Relations at Kraken; and Jai Massari, Chief Legal Officer at Lightspark. Additional witnesses may be added to the panel ahead of the hearing. Discussions are expected to cover critical topics such as market structure, stablecoin regulations, and the potential creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Lawmakers are attempting to balance oversight and fostering innovation, positioning the U.S. as a leader in digital finance while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability. This hearing comes at an important moment for the crypto industry, which has been grappling with increased regulatory scrutiny and calls for clearer compliance measures. The outcome could shape the direction of U.S. digital asset policy and influence its global standing in the crypto economy. The hearing will be webcast live, but access will only be available once proceedings begin.

U.S. Senate Banking Committee to Form Crypto Subcommittee According to FOX Business and Punchbowl News reports, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee is set to establish its first-ever crypto subcommittee , which Senator Cynthia Lummis is expected to lead. This comes a month after President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. NEW: The Senate Banking Committee, led by @SenatorTimScott , is set to establish its first ever subcommittee dedicated to #crypto .

This is similar to the House Financial Services Committee, which launched its own crypto subcommittee in 2023. Lummis, a vocal crypto advocate, recently backed Trump’s push for a strategic Bitcoin reserve . She also filed an amicus brief supporting Coinbase’s appeal against the SEC, arguing the regulator has overstepped its authority in crypto enforcement. She stated that decades-old securities laws don’t always apply to modern digital assets and called for a clear legislative framework. “With lawsuits relying on the SEC’s overreach, it is vital that the Second Circuit halts this encroachment on Congress’s lawmaking powers,” the brief stated . Trump has pledged to curb regulatory overreach and position the U.S. as a crypto hub. The Senate Banking Committee oversees financial agencies like the SEC, making this subcommittee a key step in shaping future crypto policy. Looking forward, this hearing could be the starting point for clearer crypto regulation in the U.S. and might lead to similar regulatory clarity provided by MiCA. The meeting includes many key leaders in the space, and by bringing their opinions together, the outcome could mark the beginning of the U.S.’s goal of being the crypto hub of the world.

With Qubetics presale soaring past $13.5 million, Litecoin witnessing a massive trading volume surge, and Terra Classic attempting a comeback, traders are on high alert. But with so many choices, which project stands out as the top contender? Qubetics is stealing the spotlight with its game-changing decentralized VPN, designed to enhance privacy and security across blockchain networks. Meanwhile, Litecoin is drawing attention with its $580 million in daily trading volume, proving that investors still see value in this long-standing altcoin. On the other hand, Terra Classic continues to battle for market relevance, trying to recover from its previous crashes. But with Qubetics offering a staggering ROI potential of up to 12,286.96%, could it be the ultimate pick for crypto investors in 2025? Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN is Changing the Game As Web3 adoption accelerates, privacy and security have become top concerns for businesses and individuals. Qubetics is addressing these issues head-on with its Decentralized VPN (dVPN), a groundbreaking blockchain-based solution that eliminates centralized control and censorship. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on a single provider, Qubetics’ dVPN leverages a decentralized network, allowing users to browse anonymously, secure their data, and bypass restrictions without relying on third parties. For businesses, this means enhanced protection for sensitive transactions, preventing unauthorized tracking and data leaks. Imagine an international company managing cross-border payments—Qubetics’ dVPN ensures end-to-end encryption, shielding financial data from malicious actors. Meanwhile, individuals can use the dVPN to safeguard their browsing activity from intrusive government surveillance and advertisers. What makes Qubetics even more appealing is its multi-chain compatibility, ensuring seamless integration with various blockchain ecosystems. Whether you’re a trader looking for extra security or a developer seeking privacy-focused infrastructure, Qubetics is proving why it’s among the best cryptos to buy today. Qubetics Presale Surge and Investor FOMO With each Qubetics presale stage lasting just seven days and a 10% price hike every Sunday at 12 AM, investors are rushing to secure TICS tokens before the next increase. The project’s massive $13.5 million presale tally proves that interest is skyrocketing, with over 20,800 token holders already onboard. Analysts have made bold predictions, with TICS expected to reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering a 209.67% ROI. If the token hits $1 post-presale, early buyers could see a 1138.69% return, while a $5 valuation would bring in an eye-watering 6093.48% gain. But the real speculation is around the $10 and $15 price targets, which could translate into 12,286.96% and 18,480.45% ROIs, respectively. To put this into perspective, a $1,000 investment at today’s price of $0.08073 could be worth over $122,869 if TICS reaches $10. As FOMO builds and the Qubetics presale stage 22 nears its end, investors are scrambling to lock in their tokens before the next price jump. Litecoin’s Trading Volume Skyrockets to $580 Million While Qubetics is dominating the presale space, Litecoin is making waves in the trading markets, recently hitting $580 million in daily trading volume. Despite newer altcoins entering the scene, Litecoin remains a staple for traders who value its fast transactions and low fees. This surge in trading activity signals renewed interest in the coin, especially as Bitcoin’s halving event approaches, historically benefiting Litecoin due to its similar proof-of-work model. Investors are speculating that Litecoin’s next big breakout could be around the corner, fueled by increased adoption and institutional attention. With crypto whales accumulating large amounts of LTC, traders are keeping a close eye on whether this trading volume surge is an early signal of a major price rally. While Litecoin doesn’t offer the astronomical ROI potential of Qubetics, its established market presence and steady growth make it a strong choice for risk-averse investors. Terra Classic’s Fight for Market Relevance Terra Classic remains one of the most debated cryptocurrencies, with investors divided on whether it has long-term potential or if it’s just a fading memory of its past collapse. The project is making attempts to regain trust, with ongoing community-driven efforts to restore value to its ecosystem. Despite these efforts, skepticism remains high, especially after the LUNA crash left many investors burned. Unlike Qubetics and Litecoin, which are showing clear signs of adoption and utility, Terra Classic is still struggling to prove itself as a viable investment for the future. However, speculative traders continue to bet on its potential price rebounds, believing that a community-led revival could breathe new life into the project. But with the crypto space evolving rapidly, the real question is whether Terra Classic can keep up with competitors like Qubetics, which is building real-world solutions for Web3 adoption. Conclusion: Is Qubetics the Best Crypto to Buy Today? Qubetics is making an undeniable case as one of the best cryptos to buy today, thanks to its Decentralized VPN technology, strong presale momentum, and jaw-dropping ROI potential. With $13.5 million raised and price hikes happening every week, investors are racing to get in before the next surge. Litecoin is also holding its ground, with a $580 million trading volume boost signaling strong investor interest. Meanwhile, Terra Classic remains a wildcard, with speculation driving its price movements rather than fundamental growth. For those looking for the top crypto presale with real-world utility, massive upside potential, and a growing investor base, Qubetics presale is where the real action is happening. With analysts predicting 5x to 100x gains, now might be the time to join the Qubetics presale before the price jumps again.

40661768,https://coingape.com/?p=240326,1740179847,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Lazarus Group Responsible For Bybit’s $1.4 Billion Ethereum Hack: Report,https://coingape.com/lazarus-group-responsible-for-bybits-1-4-billion-ethereum-hack/,"The Lazarus Group, a hacking organization linked to North Korea, has been identified as behind the recent $1.4 billion Ethereum theft from cryptocurrency exchange Bybit. This revelation was made after blockchain investigator ZachXBT provided strong evidence linking the attack to them. Lazarus Group Implicated in the Bybit Hack It is worth mentioning that ZachXBT’s investigation found a series of test transactions and connected wallets that led directly to the Lazarus Group. The research as shared on X included detailed graphs and time-based analysis, which have been shared with Bybit to help their ongoing investigation. Meanwhile, Arkham Intelligence, a blockchain data platform, had offered a reward of 50,000 ARKM tokens for information that could identify the hackers. After reviewing ZachXBT’s findings, Arkham confirmed the link to the Lazarus Group. They stated that his report included a full breakdown of test transactions, connected wallets, and forensic graphs showing how the attack happened. The Bybit Exploit: How Bad is it? Notably, the Bybit hack occurred on Friday, with about 401,346 ETH (worth $1.4 billion) stolen from Bybit’s cold wallet. While cold wallets are supposed to be safe since they are not connected to the internet, the hackers still managed to get in. It shows how desperate the hackers are and how fragile the cryptocurrency market is. This also raises a question of how genuinely decentralized or safe the crypto market is. On the flip side, reports also show that the stolen funds were transferred to different wallets, and at least $200 million worth of staked Ether (stETH) has already been sold on decentralized exchanges. In response to the event that has brought mixed feelings among the Bybit community and the cryptocurrency community at large, CEO Ben Zhou took to his page on X and reassured users that the exchange is financially stable and will still function well irrespective of the severity of the attack. Again, he confirmed that all client assets are fully backed and that the exchange remains solvent despite the large loss. Unfortunately, this attack has also affected the broader digital asset market. Ethereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) dropped sharply from 62.8 to 51.6 within hours. This shows a decrease in buying activity as the Lazarus Group carted away with the stolen ETH. While the RSI is still above the neutral 50 mark, this drop suggests investors are becoming more cautious. The Altcoin also decreased by 4% moments after the hack. The attack has also affected Bitcoin and other altcoins, with the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization reeling in loss. Lazarus Group and its Trend in Crypto In other news, the Lazarus Group has been responsible for some of the biggest hacks in crypto. There is speculation that the North Korean government is supporting the group. Put differently, they are a state tool that is used for stealing funds to bypass economic sanctions. In March 2022, they stole about $625 million from the Ronin Network, which is connected to the Axie Infinity game. A few months later, in June 2022, it was confirmed by the US. FBI that they had taken $100 million from Harmony’s Horizon bridge. More recently, in 2024, they stole over $300 million from Japan’s DMM Bitcoin exchange. Sadly, these attacks show that the Lazarus Group keeps changing its methods to exploit security gaps in cryptocurrency systems. The Bybit hack is another warning that stronger security measures are needed to protect digital assets. In January, the United States, Japan, and South Korea issued a joint statement to address threats from North Korean hackers. The joint statement noted that despite the threats, they are working to disrupt their potency.

Wrong trades, wild flips, and token launches — he’s turning madness into millions. Here’s how. Table of Contents The wrong LIBRA gamble Portnoy’s meme coin frenzy hits overdrive SEC heat or just noise? Hype over fundamentals, chaos over caution The wrong LIBRA gamble Dave Portnoy has never been one to shy away from the spotlight. From turning Barstool Sports into a media empire to his viral pizza reviews and high-stakes gambling, he has built a brand around being loud, unpredictable, and unapologetically himself. Lately, though, his name has been making the rounds for a different reason — crypto. And not just any crypto, but meme coins , accidental trades, and a deal he ultimately walked away from. One of the biggest stories revolves around Libra ( LIBRA ), a token that gained traction after Argentina’s President Javier Milei seemingly endorsed it. However, Portnoy’s involvement began with a different kind of LIBRA deal. Portnoy revealed that he had been paid roughly 6 million LIBRA tokens to promote the project, but after its founder, Hayden Davis , allegedly asked him to keep quiet about the arrangement, Portnoy decided to return the money. Then, in one of his most bizarre investment blunders, he mistakenly bought nearly $170,000 worth of the wrong LIBRA token — one with a completely different contract address than the high-profile version making headlines. Realizing his mistake, Portnoy took to X with his trademark mix of self-deprecation, writing, “Anybody wanna buy some fake Libra? Warning: This is a meme coin. I bought it by accident… It will be volatile. It will eventually go to zero.” Anybody wanna buy some fake Libra? Warning. This is a meme coin. I bought it by accident. It will be volatile. It will eventually go to zero. It may rip. It may tank. Don’t put on more than you can lose!!!

Milei himself is now facing accusations of financial misconduct, with some political opponents even calling for his impeachment. But that hasn’t slowed Portnoy down. If anything, it seems to have only fueled his full-throttle dive into meme coins. Let’s break down the swirling speculations and how the crypto community is reacting to the chaos. You might also like: LIBRA’s collapse becomes Solana’s biggest scandal since FTX: How Jupiter and Meteora left retail rekt Portnoy’s meme coin frenzy hits overdrive Just days after mistakenly buying the wrong Libra token and returning 6 million worth of the original LIBRA tokens, Portnoy decided to take matters into his own hands — launching his own tokens, flipping them within hours, and riding the wild volatility that defines the space. On Feb. 18, Portnoy introduced a new token called GREED through Pump.fun , a Solana ( SOL )-based platform designed to simplify meme coin creation. The branding was as on-the-nose as it gets, featuring an image of Michael Douglas’s Gordon Gekko from Wall Street, the character infamous for the line, “Greed is good.” pic.twitter.com/Iau8Xx0v9N — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 18, 2025 And for a brief moment, it was. The token skyrocketed, reaching a peak market cap of $41.5 million in just a few hours. As the excitement built, Portnoy embraced the moment, posting on X: “I kept hearing how meme coins were dead? I’m able to turn 2k into just about a million in 15 minutes if I felt like it. Doesn’t seem dead to me.” I kept hearing how meme coins were dead? I’m able to turn 2k into just about a million in 15 minutes if I felt like it. Doesn’t seem dead to me. Seems like as long as $greed exists and meme coins are legal there will be a big market for this shit. pic.twitter.com/VFo8AWNyei — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 18, 2025 But within a day, he moved all his GREED tokens into another project he had previously endorsed — JAILSTOOL — publicly declaring , “Just put all of #Greed into #jailstool which I’m never selling ‘cause I said I wouldn’t sell.” Then, on-chain data revealed that Portnoy had swapped every single GREED token he owned for JAILSTOOL tokens in a single transaction, worth an estimated $250,000 at the time, instantly crashing the price of GREED by 99%. His decision to cash out sparked backlash, with many accusing him of a “rug pull” — a term used when developers or influencers drain liquidity from a project, leaving late investors holding worthless tokens. 👀 Another wild and bloody scam story Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy ( @stoolpresidente ) just rugged his own audience. After losing $200K on fake LIBRA, he launched the GREED memecoin. It pumped to a $37M market cap, only for him to dump 35% of the supply, cashing out… pic.twitter.com/mQI9b59Du1 — Memento (@Memento_ai) February 19, 2025 Portnoy quickly defended himself, posting: “I have literally only said I will not sell 1 coin. That coin is #jailstool until it hits the 1 billion market cap.” He continued, claiming that he could have made over a million dollars from the sale but instead let GREED drop by 75% before exiting. Some facts not on this tweet. I warned people I could sell. I could have cashed out +1 million. I let it drop 75% before cashing out. Lots of people made money. I took the profits + poured it into #jailstool which I can’t touch. I didn’t make a dime on it. Some people won.… https://t.co/ARkeBKOVjX — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 19, 2025 “Lots of people made money. I took the profits + poured it into #jailstool, which I can’t touch. I didn’t make a dime on it. Some people won, some lost. Only the losers keep bitching.” Then, rather than retreating, Portnoy leaned into the controversy, boasting that he could create another token just as easily, and it would still “moon,” because, as he put it, “Nobody has principles. Just greed.” You can’t beat me. Not in this meme coin market. I could launch Greed 2 collectible coin right now and it would moon. Nobody has principles. Just greed. https://t.co/rmPxbMjQhM — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 18, 2025 Hours later, he followed through, launching GREED2 and warning investors not to put in more than they could afford to lose. *update. Just launched Greed 2. Don’t invest in this collectible coin with more than you can afford to lose. It’ll be volatile. I will not sell 1 penny till at least midnight est or maybe never. Be careful. GoL6RVGQFzTD7MdoNEHUQmNp6SgXBn6f9khxAW5Bpump https://t.co/kFuUCIgvYf — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 19, 2025 Unlike its predecessor, GREED2 struggled to gain traction. It briefly climbed to a $7 million market cap before plummeting 90% over the next five hours. On Feb. 20, he was back on X again, sharing screenshots of his Phantom Wallet balances, revealing staggering gains — 1,923% on GREED, 344% on GREED2, and various smaller profits across other meme coins. Critics condemned Portnoy’s actions as reckless, pointing to the damage they cause to retail investors who jump in late. As for Portnoy, he doesn’t seem concerned. If anything, he appears to be fully embracing the chaos. SEC heat or just noise? As Portnoy’s meme coin antics escalate, social media has become a hotbed for speculation, accusations, and unverified rumours. One of the biggest claims making the rounds is that Portnoy may be facing legal trouble. “Rumors emerging that court documents reveal Dave Portnoy is facing multiple SEC securities violations charges,” posted one user. 🚨BREAKING: Rumors emerging that court documents reveal Dave Portnoy is facing multiple SEC securities violations charges. Authorities allege serious financial misconduct, with further details expected as the case unfolds. pic.twitter.com/MOo6RMqRVs — jdub 🇮🇱 (@jdubz069) February 20, 2025 However, no actual filings or statements from regulators have emerged to confirm this. Adding to the speculation, the SEC recently unveiled the creation of a cybercrime unit aimed at tackling fraud in the crypto industry. The timing of this move has led some to suggest a direct link between Portnoy’s recent token flips and the regulatory shift. “Portnoy rugs five tokens live on a stream, two days later the SEC launches a cybercrime unit,” wrote one user. dave portnoy rugs five tokens live on a stream two days later the sec launches a cyber crime unit to target fraud in crypto enjoy crime season, retards — Zack Voell (@zackvoell) February 20, 2025 Another post adopted a more sarcastic tone: “Portnoy scammed so hard the SEC had to launch a new cyber division.” 🚨NEW: Dave Portnoy scammed so hard the SEC has to launch a new Cyber technology division💀 pic.twitter.com/gMMbJRT42f — Autism Capital 🧩 (@AutismCapital) February 20, 2025 Rather than addressing the allegations head-on, Portnoy opted to mock the situation, flipping the SEC’s announcement to jab at his critics. “Love it! So many scammers and liars out there. Let’s clean this space up! Take out the trash,” he posted, before taking a swipe at those calling him a fraud. “Can we arrest the crybabies who are told meme coins are a risk and then cry foul too?” Love it! So manny scammers and liars out there. Let’s clean this space up! Take out the trash. Together we can win. This is when it pays to be the cleanest man in crypto Ps – can we arrest the crybabies who are told not to risk more than they can lose and that Memecoins… https://t.co/JD7Nk6YfPo — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 20, 2025 So far, it’s all just noise—no official actions or formal accusations. But the growing uproar reveals how deeply his actions have divided the crypto community. Still, Portnoy isn’t backing down. If anything, he’s doubling down. Who am I to deny the will of the people. The heartbeat of trenches is Greed https://t.co/QaqknWr9vt — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 20, 2025 Hype over fundamentals, chaos over caution Portnoy’s foray into the meme coin market is quickly shaping up to be a masterclass in how hype, rather than fundamentals, can drive value in crypto. While most traders focus on returns, Portnoy seems more intrigued by the mechanics of attention. He leverages his massive following to trigger market movements, all while watching the real-time ripple effect unfold. “He’s discovered an infinite money glitch — he tweets a ticker to his 3.5M followers, and it instantly moons, then he does it again,” said Punk, the pseudonymous CCO at Memecoin ( MEME ), capturing how Portnoy’s reach alone is enough to spark immediate volatility. But it’s not just about the money. “He’s amused by the hamster wheel of traders blindly following his moves, so he keeps spinning it.” Portnoy creates a token, watches it surge, then either exits or moves on to the next. Traders know the risk but dive in anyway — not because they believe in the token, but because the activity itself is the draw. This phenomenon is far from isolated. Platforms like Pump.fun have made meme coin creation almost effortless. Since launching in January 2024, over 7.8 million tokens have been created on the platform as of Feb. 21, most offering little beyond speculative thrills. As a result, the market has become a revolving door of viral trends, where the next big token isn’t determined by innovation, but by how quickly it can spread. “Honestly, trust in crypto isn’t exactly at an all-time high,” said Tobin Kuo, CEO of Seraph Studios, in an interview with crypto.news. “At this point, even veterans are joking that the space is turning into the world’s largest casino.” That could explain why Portnoy has gone beyond just trading — he’s creating. As Punk puts it, “Every legal expert warning him only pushes him to do more. The backlash fuels his next move.” Whether this model can last or eventually collapse under its own weight remains to be seen, but as long as the hype keeps driving the market, the cycle isn’t stopping.",Feature|Influencers|Meme Coin|rug pull|SEC|United States,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|SOL,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-02-21 23:50:00

Notably, the pro-crypto stance of the Mark Uyeda-led SEC has ignited a possibility of XRP benefitting uniquely. Per the current trend, investors wonder if the coin could hit a $300 price target in the long term if the US SEC drops the XRP lawsuit. Is Ripple versus US SEC Lawsuit Suppressing XRP Price? In a recent update, Coinbase revealed that the SEC staff has agreed to drop its lawsuit , pending potential approval by the agency’s commissioners in the coming week. By a large margin, the Coinbase versus SEC lawsuit is considered the second biggest after Ripple Labs. Though similar, the Ripple lawsuit has advanced much more, with the end close as predicted. Gary Gensler fanned the lawsuit, alleging that XRP is a security when sold to the public, significantly impacting the price. Like Coinbase, there is speculation that the US SEC will dismiss its Ripple lawsuit appeal. If this happens, the price of XRP is expected to rise dramatically. Is XRP Price to $300 Feasible? In recent times, analysts have issued massive projections regarding the XRP price. As reported earlier by CoinGape, market analyst XRP Captain predicted that the XRP price could rally to $250 between now and 2026. While analysts justify this projection based on the current trend within the Ripple ecosystem, the economics presents a different picture. With XRP having more than 57.89 billion circulating supply per CoinMarketCap data , a $300 target will give it a valuation of $17.367 trillion for the coin. This fund is way bigger than the crypto industry, which is only worth $3.17 trillion, with Bitcoin dominating. However, this does not discount the likelihood of a massive rally if the lawsuit ends. The XRP ETF Advantage Meanwhile, the Ripple ecosystem has continued to expand at a unique pace. More than four asset managers are seeking approval to offer XRP ETF products to institutional investors. Canary Capital, Bitwise, and CoinShares are some of the firms pushing for this new product. With a 65% odds of approval , the community is somewhat pricing in this product already. With the likelihood of a new capital influx, the expectation is that the XRP price will benefit immensely in the long term.

Dogecoin Whales Liquidate 100 Million Coins,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/panic-or-opportunity-dogecoin-whales-liquidate-100-million-coins/,"The crypto market is paying attention to a massive Dogecoin (DOGE) transaction. A whale transferred 100 million DOGE, or about $25.42 million, to Binance. The move has raised questions about whether a sell-off is about to happen or if this is just another typical shift in holdings. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ready For ‘Take Off’—Analyst Reveals Key Signals Whale Activity Sparks Concerns When a major cryptocurrency holder moves a sizable amount of their holdings to an exchange, it usually means they want to sell. The price of DOGE may drop as a result, which would cause smaller investors to react. However, cryptocurrency expert Ali Martinez noted a decline in whale activity overall, suggesting that major investors are not acting aggressively for the time being. Whale activity on the #Dogecoin $DOGE network has declined by nearly 88% since mid-November! pic.twitter.com/6X4CIH3mf8 — Ali (@ali_charts) February 17, 2025 DOGE’s present market performance points to vagueness. As of the time of writing, the price is $0.255622; an intraday high is $0.257605 and a low is $0.250725. These swings imply a rather limited trading range; but, if more significant holders decide to sell their shares, volatility might increase. Market Sentiment Remains Divided According to certain traders, the whale transfer is a bearish signal, while others believe that its influence may be negligible unless an influx of additional coins occurs. Dogecoin has a history of reacting sharply to whale movements; however, the aggregate selling pressure appears to be subdued this time. The ongoing discussion regarding a potential DOGE exchange-traded fund (ETF) is another significant factor that affects sentiment. If an ETF acquires momentum, it may attract institutional investors, potentially counteracting any selling pressure from whales. Nevertheless, the market is currently in a state of supposition, as no official approvals or timelines have been announced. The Road Ahead For Dogecoin Despite the whale move, the price of DOGE continues to remain steady, but if market sentiment shifts, there could be a further drop. Further dumping may occur if the price of DOGE drops below $0.25, which might further lower the price. On the other hand, strong purchasing activity may act as a barrier to further decrease.

With meme coins showing signs of another pullback, experienced investors are looking for a more resilient alternative that can weather crashes and still deliver massive returns. That’s why many are shifting to this AI altcoin that doesn’t rely on hype alone but offers real utility, strong fundamentals, and cutting-edge technology that ensures long-term demand. This makes it the perfect hedge against market uncertainty. Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Face Growing Uncertainty Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have dominated the meme coin market, but their explosive growth may be fading. Over the past few months, SHIB has struggled to break out of its downward trend, slipping from highs of $0.000033 to nearly half that value. Key support levels have failed, raising concerns about further downside risks. Dogecoin isn’t faring much better. While Elon Musk’s influence has occasionally pumped its price, long-term investors see a pattern; sharp rallies followed by deep corrections. Even with Dogecoin’s potential integration into X, the lack of fundamental utility makes it a highly speculative asset. On-chain data reveals that major SHIB and DOGE holders are shifting capital into new projects with stronger fundamentals, and RCO Finance (RCOF) has emerged as a top choice. Why RCO Finance Is Gaining Momentum RCO Finance is a fully operational AI-powered trading platform that helps users make smarter investment decisions. At the heart of RCOF is its Robo Advisor, an advanced AI system that scans global financial markets, analyzes real-time data from sources like Bloomberg and Reuters, and provides actionable insights for traders. This AI tool can detect emerging trends before they go mainstream, allowing investors to capitalize on early-stage opportunities. Take recent examples like TRUMP and MELANIA tokens. These low-cap coins surged 100x in just days, but most traders missed out. RCOF’s AI is designed to spot these breakouts before they happen, giving users a major advantage. Beyond maximizing gains, the AI also protects investors from market downturns. It can identify weakening trends, recommend exit points, and even adjust portfolio allocations to optimize risk exposure. This strategic approach removes emotional decision-making and ensures smarter, data-driven trading. But RCOF goes beyond crypto investing. The platform offers access to 120,000+ investment options, including stocks, ETFs, bonds, and even tokenized real estate, all within a non-KYC environment. Investors can diversify seamlessly without lengthy verification processes, while RCOF’s crypto debit card allows instant spending without manual conversions. Early Investors Are Rushing Into RCOF’s Presale Shiba Inu and Dogecoin investors are moving into RCOF not just for its AI advantages but also for its lucrative presale opportunity. Unlike most early crypto projects, RCOF already has a live Beta Platform with 10,000+ active users testing its AI-driven tools. The Robo Advisor’s monitoring capabilities will continue improving, enhancing its predictive accuracy over time. This means early adopters are getting in before the AI reaches full optimization, setting them up for long-term gains. Currently, RCOF is in Presale Stage 5 , selling at $0.10 per token. The next stage will push the price up to $0.13, giving today’s buyers an instant 30% profit before the token even lists on major exchanges. A $1,000 investment today would become $1,300 in just weeks once the next presale stage begins. After exchange listings, analysts predict 10,000x growth, meaning an early $500 investment could potentially turn into $500,000. Additionally, RCOF has passed a security audit by SolidProof , confirming its smart contracts are safe and free from vulnerabilities. Unlike meme coins that fluctuate based on trends, RCOF is a fundamentally sound investment backed by real demand. Meme Coins Had Their Run; RCOF Is the Next Big Opportunity Shiba Inu and Dogecoin still have loyal communities, but their long-term upside is limited. Even if Dogecoin somehow climbs to $1, that’s only a 5x return; far below what RCOF is expected to achieve. Meanwhile, RCOF is just getting started, meaning the potential for rapid growth and mainstream adoption is far higher. With AI-driven trading tools, a working Beta platform, strong investor demand, and built-in real-world utility, RCO Finance is positioned for explosive gains in 2025. The opportunity won’t last forever. Investors who got in during earlier RCOF stages have already secured major profits, and with the presale moving quickly, prices will only go up from here. Waiting too long could mean missing out on one of the most profitable crypto launches of the year.

This achievement, coupled with a current price of $0.0248 per coin in Batch 27 and a 2380% surge, positions BlockDAG as a project to watch. But beyond the impressive numbers, BlockDAG’s commitment to education, exemplified by the appointment of Marcus Xavier as Head of Learning, suggests a long-term vision for the project. This article will explore the significance of structured blockchain education, particularly in the context of BlockDAG’s rapid growth and the broader adoption of decentralized technologies. The importance of understanding BDAG, DAG, and KAS within this evolving landscape will also be examined. BlockDAG’s Educational Initiative: Building a Foundation for the Future The addition of Marcus Xavier , with his extensive background in education and emerging technologies, signals BlockDAG’s dedication to fostering a knowledgeable community. As Head of Learning, Xavier will develop the BlockDAG Academy, a learning hub designed to provide structured blockchain education. This initiative is particularly relevant given BlockDAG’s presale success, which has seen over 18.6 billion coins sold and a nearly $200 million raise. The academy aims to equip users, developers, and businesses with the practical skills needed to engage with the BlockDAG ecosystem. This focus on education is a crucial component of BlockDAG’s strategy, demonstrating a commitment to more than just short-term gains. The BlockDAG team understands that widespread adoption depends on accessible and comprehensive educational resources. A Career Dedicated to Learning and Emerging Tech Xavier’s career path reflects a deep interest in the intersection of education and technology. His experience spans B2B e-commerce, tech startups, and higher education. Having witnessed the early stages of the internet boom, Xavier developed an understanding of both the potential and the limitations of centralized systems. This led him to explore the possibilities of decentralized technologies and their ability to address existing gaps.

Amidst these, TRUMP Coin experiences volatile price movements due to major exchange listings, and Chainlink (LINK) looks to rally, yet it’s Web3Bay’s approach to secure online shopping that may truly transform the e-commerce landscape. Leveraging smart contract escrow, Web3Bay not only promises but provides a safe, fraud-free environment, a stark contrast to the speculative nature of many digital assets. While the market dances to the tune of volatile meme coins and seasoned cryptos, Web3Bay introduces a grounded, practical blockchain application, ensuring secure and transparent e-commerce transactions—potentially redefining how we conduct online business. Innovative Escrow Systems Set Web3Bay Apart Online shopping often falls prey to scams, including prevalent issues like fake reviews and rampant chargebacks that compromise both buyer and seller confidence. Web3Bay directly addresses these vulnerabilities with its innovative smart contract escrow system, safeguarding transactions to ensure they are secure, transparent, and immune to disputes. By automating escrow, Web3Bay effectively shields against fraudulent listings and the common pitfall of chargeback fraud, bolstering security for all market participants. This system is particularly advantageous for small business owners who frequently face hefty losses from fraudulent disputes, and consumers who will benefit from interacting with verified, trustworthy sellers. The blockchain’s immutable nature also ensures that product reviews cannot be falsified, cultivating a reliable marketplace atmosphere. With these mechanisms, Web3Bay is not merely participating in e-commerce; it is setting new standards for it. As the platform progresses, Web3Bay’s presale success—having raised $1.5 million in stage 4 for $0.004562625, with over 370 billion tokens sold—underscores the market’s growing demand for secure, reliable online transactions. Web3Bay is quickly establishing itself as a frontrunner in combating e-commerce fraud. TRUMP Coin’s Market Fluctuations After Upbit Listing TRUMP Coin, associated with former U.S. President Donald Trump, saw its value spike over 20% following its introduction on South Korea’s largest exchange, Upbit. This listing expanded its availability, adding new trading pairs and sparking a surge in trading activity that pushed its valuation significantly. Although it has seen substantial fluctuations, falling from a high market cap back down to more modest levels, the recent exposure has reignited interest, with projections suggesting a potential rise to between $35 and $40 in the near term. This exemplifies the profound impact that major exchange listings can have on meme-based assets, especially in markets like South Korea where retail trading is fervent. TRUMP remains a token to watch, as speculation continues to drive its market dynamics. Chainlink’s Prospects: Aiming for $23 Chainlink (LINK) is presently priced at $18.59, firmly supported between $17 and $18. The TD Sequential indicator has recently given a buy signal close to these levels, pointing to a possible ascent to $21 and potentially extending to $23. This projection is bolstered by historical data indicating that $21 has served as a frequent consolidation area, while $23 has consistently posed a notable resistance level. Simultaneously, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 48.94, signaling a balanced market condition, and the Directional Movement Index (DMI) shows a tight contest between buyers and sellers. Furthermore, whales hold 67% of LINK’s circulating supply, with current statistics revealing that 57% of investors are seeing profits, whereas 40% are experiencing losses. Taking these elements into account, alongside trends in exchange outflows which suggest diminishing selling pressures, there’s a solid groundwork for anticipating a push towards the $23 threshold. Wrapping Up! As the crypto market continues to evolve with its typical unpredictability, the emphasis remains on security and utility for sustainable growth. TRUMP Coin’s dramatic swings underscore the impact of exchange dynamics, while Chainlink’s technical setup hints at possible gains. Amidst these, Web3Bay’s smart contract escrow emerges as a crucial development, addressing the core challenges of online shopping fraud. This approach not only mitigates common e-commerce risks but also provides a substantial foundation for trust and reliability in digital transactions. While many chase market highs and lows, Web3Bay is crafting a more secure future for online shopping, promising more than just speculative benefits.

While XRP has long been a dominant player in the crypto space, newer projects with real-world applications and cutting-edge innovations are starting to take center stage. PropiChain is one such project, gaining traction for its unique approach to real estate. With analysts predicting massive gains, early investors are seeing PropiChain as an opportunity too good to ignore. Why Crypto Traders Are Looking Beyond XRP XRP has been a key player in the crypto market for years, particularly in cross-border payments. Its fast transaction speeds and low fees have made it a favorite among financial institutions. However, despite its strengths, XRP has faced challenges, including regulatory battles and market competition. As the market evolves, crypto traders are looking for projects that not only provide fast transactions but also offer tangible real-world benefits. This is where PropiChain is making waves. Instead of focusing solely on financial transactions, PCHAIN is bridging the gap between blockchain and real-world asset ownership, particularly in real estate. Crypto traders recognize that the future of blockchain lies in practical use cases, and PropiChain’s unique approach is positioning it as a strong contender in the market. What Gives Propichain the Edge? One of the main reasons PropiChain is attracting attention is its ability to revolutionize real estate investment. Traditionally, buying property requires significant capital, complex legal processes, and time-consuming paperwork. PropiChain simplifies this by allowing investors to buy fractional shares of high-value properties. This means that instead of needing millions to invest in premium real estate, users can start with as little as a few hundred dollars. But PropiChain isn’t stopping at fractional ownership. Its AI-powered analytics help investors make smarter decisions by analyzing market trends and identifying high-potential real estate investments. It’s like having access to AI-driven insights that tell you when and where to invest for maximum returns. Additionally, the project integrates tokenization to ensure secure and transparent ownership of real-world assets. Each property listed on PropiChain is converted into a digital token on the blockchain, making it easy to buy, sell, or trade without the complexities of traditional real estate transactions. Beyond real estate, PropiChain is also venturing into the metaverse. With the growing popularity of digital assets, the platform allows investors to purchase virtual real estate and participate in the booming metaverse economy. This creates an entirely new way for investors to diversify their portfolios. To further enhance efficiency, PropiChain uses smart contracts to automate property transactions, rental agreements, and payments. Instead of relying on traditional legal and financial intermediaries, these contracts execute transactions securely and instantly, reducing costs and eliminating unnecessary delays. Additionally, PropiChain’s global accessibility ensures that investors from anywhere in the world can participate in real estate markets that were previously out of reach. With blockchain removing geographic barriers, users can invest in premium properties across different countries without having to go through the complexities of international property transactions. Security and Market Recognition Strengthen Confidence Security is always a major concern for crypto traders, which is why PropiChain has undergone a thorough security audit to ensure its smart contracts and blockchain infrastructure are secure. This level of transparency reassures investors that their assets are protected. Additionally, PropiChain has been listed on CoinMarketCap , a major milestone that boosts its visibility and credibility in the market. A CoinMarketCap listing signals legitimacy and increases exposure to a global audience of investors looking for the next high-growth crypto project. How Much Could Investors Earn with PropiChain? PropiChain is still in stage 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.011, giving early investors a rare chance to buy in at a low price before major price movements occur. A $1,000 investment at the current presale price could grow exponentially, offering life-changing returns up to $100,000 if PropiChain reaches its expected 100x.. Interestingly, PropiChain is still in its early stages, presenting a unique opportunity for those looking to invest before the mainstream market catches on. With a solid foundation, real-world applications, and growing interest from crypto traders, PropiChain has the potential to deliver significant returns. XRP has had its moment, but as the blockchain landscape continues to evolve, newer projects like PropiChain are proving that the future belongs to altcoins with real utility. For those looking to get ahead of the curve, keeping an eye on PropiChain could be the smartest move yet, as it could be the next life-changing investment. Don’t miss out.

Bons argues that BTC is no longer sustainable, especially after having lost its desirable qualities According to Bons, BTC has lost all its attractive qualities, so it won’t last very long. He argued that without capacity, scarcity, privacy, DeFi, or long-term security, the asset has “no legs to stand on.” He even stated that Bitcoin’s other impressive qualities, such as censorship resistance, immutability, financial sovereignty, and decentralization, are long gone and only pioneered by other emerging assets, saying the top asset lost its key principles to corruption. He further commented: BTC was effectively captured by a relatively small group of people who managed to entirely pivot the purpose, vision, and fundamental design of BTC. This did not happen without a fight. That history is now known as the block size debates, cumulating in 2017 when “Bitcoin Core” “won” and Bitcoin lost. Justin Bons He believes a group of people is still controlling BTC, and unfortunately, traders are still in the dark about the token’s reality. He even compared the current BTC governance to more of a Github dictatorship, saying the Core deterred any future expansion to BTC’s capacity, as opposed to Satoshi’s wants. Furthermore, he argued that Bitcoin currently sees only about seven transactions in a second, meaning it cannot be utilized for anything vital. He said that the token has to continuously rely on centralized holders to grow, which was not part of Satoshi’s original plan. Moreover, he said the core altered the token’s economic design to depend on few transactions with really high fees rather than many transactions with low fees, claiming that this also destroyed the asset’s long-term security model. Bons says BTC could fall in the next 8-12 years Bons believes that high trading activity on the BTC blockchain could make transaction fees surge to peak levels, even forcing traders to leave. He pointed out that this trend has been playing out on a smaller scale in recent years, leading to occasional fee spikes. However, he warned that this cycle “spells doom” for Bitcoin in the long term. He even expects the digital asset to collapse in the next 8 to 12 years, saying that an inflation rise past the 21 million cap will be its only saving grace then. He also projects a “bank-run”-like situation for when the token collapses, seeing how difficult it would be for every trader to transfer or withdraw all their assets. To him, BTC can never be a medium of exchange without capacity and will be a horrible store of value without long-term security. He even claims that BTC will reach a point where its price can no longer rise, and a “reckoning” will happen then. He has urged his followers to support Bitcoin by abandoning it and seeing Satoshi’s vision materialize in BTC’s children.

He emphasized their role in sustaining the current bullish trend. According to Martinez’s analysis, these levels have historically acted as both resistance and support for the altcoin. The repeated interaction with this range indicates its significance in determining ADA price direction. Key Support Levels for Cardano Price Stability In a post on X , Ali Martinez highlighted that Cardano price has repeatedly tested the $0.67–$0.80 range. This zone has provided stability for ADA, preventing further declines and acting as a foundation for bullish movements. Historical price movements suggest that this support area has been critical during both uptrends and corrections. The ability of ADA to hold above this range signals strong buying interest. Recent market data indicates that ADA remains within this support range, maintaining its position despite market fluctuations. If buying pressure persists, Cardano price could establish a stronger footing and attempt an upward breakout. Meanwhile, Grok 3 AI highlighted Cardano’s strong decentralization as a driving force behind its potential rally to $5-$6 in this bull cycle. If Cardano price can break key resistance levels, it may gain the bullish momentum needed to reach these ambitious price targets. Technical Indicators Suggest Growing Buying Pressure Cardano price is about to cross the 20-day Exponential Moving Average, a significant indicator for short-term trend identification. The 20 EMA acts as a support level and a breakout above it may indicate a rally for the altcoin. Supporting the bullish sentiments, the 1-day Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicates Cardano price is holding above key support levels, providing a foundation for a altcoin rally. More so, the MACD line is above the signal line, signaling a bullish crossover. If ADA maintains its position above $0.75 and builds on this momentum, it will break the $0.80 resistance and push higher in the short term. Furthermore, there is the Parabolic Stop and Reverse (SAR) indicator whose dotted lines are placed below Cardano price, which is common in an upward trend . This suggests that ADA price has found a strong support base, further reinforcing the likelihood of an upward move. Source: TradingView ADA Price To $1? If Cardano price remains above the key support range of $0.67–$0.80 and manages to break above resistance levels, analysts project a potential rally toward $0.94. A successful test of this price point could pave the way for ADA to revisit the $1 mark. Conversely, if ADA fails to sustain support above $0.67, selling pressure could increase, driving the price lower. In such a scenario, the next key support level would be around $0.54, where buyers might re-enter the market. Moreover, another analyst shared the bullish sentiments, emphasizing that ADA price movements suggest a potential breakout. The expert highlighted that if Cardano surpasses the critical resistance at $0.9837, it could pave the way for a rally toward $1.35.

Major shifts are happening, with XRP coin drawing attention due to ETF speculation and Solana facing increased short positions as network activity declines. Despite Solana’s recent price dip, long-term interest in its ecosystem remains strong. Meanwhile, Web3Bay , a decentralized e-commerce platform, is transforming blockchain-based shopping by integrating crypto, fiat, and PayPal payments. This hybrid system offers users a smoother shift into decentralized commerce without giving up familiar payment methods. With regulatory decisions impacting XRP, market shifts affecting Solana, and Web3Bay’s payment model gaining traction, crypto adoption is evolving. Each project represents different aspects of this change—finance, blockchain infrastructure, and real-world use—making them key players in shaping the market’s next chapter. Web3Bay’s Hybrid Payment System Simplifies Blockchain Shopping For crypto to gain more users, it must be easy to use. Web3Bay tackles this by offering a decentralized e-commerce platform that accepts crypto, fiat, and PayPal payments. This hybrid approach is more flexible than most blockchain marketplaces, letting users choose the payment method that suits them. Whether they prefer stablecoins, bank transfers, or digital wallets, Web3Bay removes the barriers that often discourage people from trying decentralized commerce. The demand for this system is evident. Web3Bay’s presale has raised over $1.5 million, with more than 370 million 3BAY tokens sold. With a 6,430% ROI potential, early buyers are securing their positions before the final presale price of $0.1959. Spanning 28 stages, this structure rewards early supporters while ensuring steady value growth before the platform’s official launch. By merging crypto’s flexibility with fiat’s convenience, Web3Bay makes decentralized shopping more accessible for everyday use. Even XRP coin holders seeking practical ways to spend their crypto can benefit from Web3Bay’s smooth and user-friendly payment system. Analyzing XRP Coin’s ETF Speculation XRP coin is at a crucial point, with speculation rising over a potential XRP ETF approval. The SEC is currently reviewing an application that could allow institutional investors to access XRP through a regulated exchange-traded fund. Approval could boost demand and drive further market activity. Ripple is also expanding its ecosystem with Ripple USD (RLUSD), a stablecoin designed for enterprise use, strengthening XRP’s role in crypto payments. At $2.56, XRP has experienced high volatility, with analysts predicting a potential rise to $5–$7 in the coming months. While traders are split on short-term performance, long-term optimism remains, supported by growing institutional interest and improving regulatory clarity. With financial institutions watching closely, XRP’s next move could have a significant impact on the broader crypto market. Solana Price Drips as Market Sentiment Weakens The Solana price has dropped to $167.28, down 8.14% over the past 24 hours. A rise in short positions reflects bearish sentiment, partly due to declining network activity. On-chain data shows a 55% drop in active addresses since November 2024, raising concerns about user engagement. Despite this, Solana’s ecosystem remains a hub for growth, with developers continuing to create new applications. External factors are also playing a role. The recent U.S. presidential election has sparked discussions on crypto regulations, boosting interest in both Solana and XRP coins. Institutional inflows into Solana-based investment products indicate that demand remains strong despite recent price drops. Many analysts see this dip as a potential setup for future growth, depending on how the market responds to broader economic and regulatory trends. Final Remarks! Crypto is evolving quickly, with XRP coin, Solana, and Web3Bay driving different aspects of this shift. While XRP awaits regulatory clarity and Solana faces short-term volatility, Web3Bay is making crypto payments more practical for real-world use. As a decentralized e-commerce platform , Web3Bay’s hybrid payment system bridges the gap between traditional finance and blockchain, making it easier for users to engage in decentralized shopping. With over $1.5 million raised and a solid presale structure, Web3Bay shows the real demand for accessible and flexible payment solutions. Whether through investments, blockchain infrastructure, or real-world adoption, these three projects are shaping the future of crypto.

The Shiba Inu price has long been a favorite among retail investors, yet recent stagnation below $0.3 has raised concerns about its long-term viability. Meanwhile, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is emerging as a powerhouse, with a 750x growth potential that presents a lucrative opportunity for investors. The Ethereum-based AI’s ongoing presale is already attracting substantial investments, signaling massive confidence in its long-term success. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The 750x Growth Opportunity Drawing Investors In WallitIQ (WLTQ) stands out as a transformative force in the multi-billion-dollar crypto wallet and AI security industry rather than being just another token. With a presale that is rapidly gaining traction, thousands of investors are securing early positions, enabling the DeFi wallet’s price to skyrocket once the next round begins. The current presale round has already seen record-breaking investments, with projections indicating a price surge of over 750x after the token launches publicly. WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers a secure, AI-powered decentralized wallet that allows direct trading of over 1,000 cryptocurrencies. Presale investors gain access to discounted prices and benefit from lower transaction fees, exclusive features, and governance rights, which allow them to influence platform development. These benefits have attracted SHIB whales and DOGE whales looking to diversify into a token with tangible use cases and a strong financial model. Security remains paramount, with AI-driven technology proactively detecting threats and safeguarding digital assets against hacks. The integration of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) enables transactions and private keys to remain protected. More than just a wallet, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers an entire financial ecosystem where investors can earn, trade, and govern the platform’s future. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is launching its beta platform soon, offering early adopters access to its innovative AI-driven crypto wallet. This phase will highlight security features, trading options, and asset management tools, showcasing the future of decentralized finance. Additionally, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has passed a rigorous audit by SolidProof, certifying its smart contracts as secure and transparent. This commitment to compliance and security positions the Ethereum-based AI as a strong alternative to stagnant assets like the Shiba Inu price, instilling investor confidence. The MVP version of the WallitIQ (WLTQ) mobile app establishes it as a frontrunner in the development of crypto wallets. This launch will unveil cutting-edge features aimed at improving wallet management, incorporating real-time pricing, and offering sophisticated trading options. Selling at a discounted price of $0.0420 , WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents a compelling opportunity as the Shiba Inu price stagnates below $0.3. With overwhelming demand and potential for 750x growth, a significant price increase appears inevitable, making it an appealing choice for savvy investors. Shiba Inu Price: A Struggle To Regain Momentum Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a popular token, but its inability to push past $0.3 has left investors questioning its ability to deliver sustained returns. The Shiba Inu price whales have continuously supported the token, but diminishing trading volumes suggest a weakening demand. Investors who once anticipated explosive growth are now watching as the token remains trapped in a cycle of minor rallies and corrections. Despite previous gains, the Shiba Inu price struggles to generate the same enthusiasm as it once did. Investors who rode the early wave of the Shiba Inu price success are now weighing alternative options, as meme-based speculation alone is no longer enough to sustain long-term growth. While the Shiba Inu price whales continue holding significant positions, the broader market sentiment remains lukewarm. With investors looking for the next high-reward opportunity, the focus is shifting toward WallitIQ (WLTQ) and its unprecedented growth potential. Conclusion: WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is The Top Investment Opportunity Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a well-known asset, but its stagnant price performance is causing investors to seek alternatives. With WallitIQ (WLTQ) offering a 750x growth potential, AI-driven security, and lucrative presale rewards, the decision for investors is clear. The presale is already attracting record-breaking investments , with thousands of investors recognizing the massive upside potential. SHIB whales and DOGE whales are investing in the Ethereum-based token, anticipating exponential gains once it launches publicly. Now is the time to secure a position in what could be the most profitable investment of the year.

Story ( IP ) launched on February 13th at the listing price of $2.26 and is now trading at $5.98 at time of writing. It’s already the 71st-largest crypto asset by market cap and has surged by nearly 120% in the past 24 hours alone. Story is a scalable intellectual property solution that aims to serve as a blockchain where rights holders can upload IP, set the terms of use and monetize it throughout the protocol’s application ecosystem.

The banks outlined the Q4 losses in “net charge-offs” statements, revealing loans that the banks have declared as uncollectible and removed from their books after exhausting efforts to recover the owed amounts. JPMorgan Chase reported the highest charge-offs at $2.4 billion, driven largely by customers with big unpaid balances on their credit cards. Bank of America recorded $1.5 billion in charge-offs, also primarily from its credit card portfolio. And Wells Fargo reported $1.288 billion in charge-offs, fueled by higher credit card losses and commercial real estate losses in its office portfolio. The new numbers come as US credit card debt hits a record $1.21 trillion, according to new numbers from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The collective losses at the three banks represent a $188 million increase over the previous quarter, and a $460 million increase from one year ago. Despite the losses, the banks reported major earnings in Q4, with JPMorgan Chase declaring $14 billion in profits, Bank of America reporting $6.7 billion and Wells Fargo coming in at $5.1 billion.

Amid this, XRP, the native token of Ripple Labs, has once again neared a crucial support level from the ascending trendline, which it has been testing since the beginning of February 2025. Considering the current market sentiment and XRP’s outlook, the token appears to have absorbed all the bearish pressure and is now recovering. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, as the XRP price reached the trendline support of $2.50 level a significant buying pressure was observed resulting in the formation of a bullish candlestick pattern. Besides this, the recent price drop has not affected XRP’s past ascending triangle price action pattern which it has formed. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, if XRP holds above the $2.50 level, there is a strong possibility that the asset could soar significantly in the coming days and maintain its bullish momentum. However, if the token fails to hold this level and closes a four-hour candle below $2.45, a massive price drop could occur, potentially pushing XRP down to the $1.90 level. Despite the ongoing price recovery, the asset remains below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), indicating that it is still in a downtrend. Current Price Momentum With these key levels in focus, XRP is currently trading near $2.58, having dropped over 3.75% in the past 24 hours. However, despite the decline, investors and traders have shown strong interest in the token, leading to a 44% increase in participation. $21.50 Million Worth XRP Outflow Data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass revealed that this rise in participation is driven by significant investor accumulation of XRP tokens. Spot inflow/outflow data showed that as the price dropped, exchanges witnessed a substantial outflow of $21.50 million worth of XRP tokens, indicating potential accumulation. Source: Coinglass Combining this potential accumulation with price action, the current level appears to be an ideal buying opportunity, with $2.50 or $2.45 serving as a potential exit level if sentiment shifts toward the bearish side.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 01:11:47

TD Sequential Says Yes,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/is-it-time-to-buy-xrp-td-sequential-says-yes/,"A cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out how the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential has just given a buy signal on the hourly XRP price chart. XRP Has Just Witnessed A Bullish Setup On TD Sequential In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about a TD Sequential signal that XRP has seen recently. The “TD Sequential” here refers to an indicator from technical analysis (TA) that’s used for locating probable points of reversal in any asset’s price. The indicator consists of two phases: setup and countdown. In the first of these, candles of the same polarity (that is, whether red or green) are counted up to nine. Once these candles, which don’t have to be one after the other, are printed on the chart, the TD Sequential gives a reversal signal. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Plunges 58%: How Do Shiba Inu & Pepe Compare? The countdown phase begins as soon as the setup is over. This phase also works much in the same way, with the only difference being that candles here are counted up to thirteen, not nine. Once the countdown is finished, the asset can be assumed to have arrived at another potential turnaround. Where a TD Sequential signal might lead the price naturally depends on the type of candle that led to the phase’s completion. Green candles naturally mean a correction may be coming, while red ones suggest a bullish reversal. XRP has recently completed the former TD Sequential phase on its 1-hour price. Here is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows this pattern forming for the cryptocurrency: As is visible in the above graph, the TD Sequential has finished a setup with nine red candles for XRP recently, which implies the cryptocurrency’s price can be considered to have reached a bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin RHODL Momentum Slowing Down—Analyst Warns Pattern ‘Not Ideal’ If the pattern indeed holds, then the asset would next see a rebound to the upside. Though, given the fact that this buy signal has formed on a short timeframe (1-hour), the surge resulting from the signal may not be too large. Speaking of the TD Sequential, XRP isn’t the only cryptocurrency that has displayed a bullish formation in its hourly price. As Martinez has pointed out in another X post, Steller (XLM) has also seen a buy setup recently. “Stellar $XLM is ready to rebound as the TD Sequential indicator shows a buy signal on the hourly chart!” notes the analyst. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the signal would come to fruition for XRP and XLM or not. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.67, down 1% in the last seven days.

The company was facing a potential lawsuit from the SEC over NFTs being classified as securities. Bloomberg reported on Friday that the SEC told OpenSea that the agency had closed its investigation without taking enforcement action. SEC issued Wells Notice, but OpenSea resisted NFT securities classification The development follows a Wells notice issued to the NFT marketplace last August, indicating the SEC’s intent to take legal action. The agency had been investigating whether some NFTs traded on OpenSea’s platform were actually securities, part of its wider push to regulate the crypto industry. A Wells notice is a formal communication from the SEC that allows the recipient to respond before the agency makes a final enforcement decision. Even though the notice indicated the SEC thought some NFTs might be subject to securities laws, OpenSea had taken the position that classifying them this way would misunderstand the current laws and choke innovation in the space. Devin Finzer, co-founder and CEO of OpenSea, welcomed the news and said the development is a win for everyone who is making and building in their space. He added that attempting to label NFTs as securities would have set them back. According to Finzer, every creator, no matter how small, should be able to build without undue friction.” Finzer’s comments echo the views of other NFT and broader web3 community members who have contended that NFTs are primarily a form of digital collectibles and art, not financial securities. OpenSea had already reserved $5 million in a legal defense fund to help NFT artists and developers who could be scrutinized by the SEC. Crypto community pushes back as SEC eases NFT and crypto regulations The SEC’s efforts to define NFTs as securities have been met with a widespread backlash from the crypto community who see such regulation as a barrier to innovation. For holders and creators of at least some NFTs, the SEC’s decision to close the investigation without enforcement action potentially signals a more lenient approach to enforcement regarding NFTs, which may be a relief for marketplaces, creators, and collectors that have been scrambling to parse existing regulatory guidance. Meanwhile, in a related development, the SEC has also dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase. The crypto exchange revealed earlier today that the SEC staff had agreed in principle to dismiss the case, subject to final approval by the commissioners. If formally adopted, the dismissal would be with prejudice, which would bar the SEC from reissuing similar charges against Coinbase in the future and could impact other ongoing legal fights involving other crypto platforms. The SEC’s decision not to pursue OpenSea any further is a landmark moment for the NFT space and confirms that digital assets as a whole should not be shoehorned into historical securities-based regulation. With OpenSea free from the concerns of regulatory action, creators and developers within the NFT space can focus on innovating as the specter of gory enforcement recedes.

Additionally, ADA’s four-hour chart appears to be mirroring XRP’s , which looks bullish. Current Price Momentum Currently, ADA is trading near $0.77 and has dropped 3.25% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume surged by 45%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors. Cardano (ADA) Bullish and Bearish Levels Despite market fluctuations, the $0.74 level will play a crucial role today. Based on recent price momentum, this level will determine whether ADA sinks or gains upward momentum. Source: Trading View On the positive side, if ADA holds this level, there is a strong possibility it could soar 10% to reach $0.85 in the coming hours. Additionally, if the bullish rally continues, it could gain another 20% to reach $1.01 in the coming days. On the bearish side, if ADA fails to hold the $0.74 level and closes a four-hour candle below it, there is a strong possibility of a 10% drop to $0.65.

The token gained over 44% in value, according to price data on Crypto.news. Derivatives data and on-chain analysis supports a bullish thesis for the DeFi token for next week. Derivatives data from crypto intelligence platform Coinglass shows a large positive spike in Open Interest in MKR on February 21. The spike represents a massive increase in the total value of open contracts in MKR across derivatives exchanges. Coinglass data shows that MKR OI is $116.85 million at the time of writing on Friday, February 21. MKR Futures Open Interest | Source: Coinglass The total value of assets locked in MKR surged to $5.675 billion, as seen on DeFiLlama. This coincides with the rising price, relevance, and demand for tokens among traders. The rebranding to Sky protocol has proven effective for driving adoption in market participants. Maker TVL | Source: DeFiLlama Santiment data shows several negative spikes in Network realized profit/loss metric in the MKR chart since mid-January 2025. This shows several traders and MKR holders are shedding their holdings and realizing losses. Consistent realization of losses is typically considered a sign of capitulation and is consistent with an eventual recovery in the token’s price. MKR’s daily active addresses recorded a nearly three-month peak this week, signalling the rise in interest from traders. MKR token’s supply held by whales (excluding exchange wallets) has climbed, recovering from the decline noted in the first week of February. This is another bullish sign for the DeFi token. Maker on-chain analysis | Source: Santiment The In/Out of money around price indicator on IntoTheBlock shows that 30% of the wallet addresses holding MKR are currently sitting on unrealized losses. 65.55% of MKR token holders have unrealized gains in their portfolio. Combining the In/Out of the money with the Network realized profit/loss metric, it is less likely that profitable traders take profits as the current trend is that of capitulation. The likelihood of further selling pressure on MKR is low for next week, meaning the token could extend its gains and maintain the underlying positive momentum. In/Out of the Money around price | Source: IntoTheBlock Maker (MKR) weekly price forecast Maker broke out of its downward trend on February 12, since then the token has rallied, extending gains nearly everyday this week. At the time of writing, MKR is trading at $1,473, on Friday. The token is close to resistance at $1,632 and $2,050, two key levels in MKR’s upward trend between October 26 and December 4, as observed in the daily price chart. In the event of a correction, MKR could find support at $1,125. Two key technical indicators, the Moving average convergence divergence indicator and relative strength index flash bullish signs on the daily timeframe. MACD shows consecutive green histogram bars above the neutral line and RSI reads 74 and is sloping upwards. While this typically generates a sell signal, in the case of MKR, MACD and the underlying positive momentum in the MKR price trend support further gains. MKR/USDT daily price chart | Source: Crypto.news A rally to test resistance at $1,632 marks a nearly 15% rally in MKR price. Even as whales cash out their MKR holdings amidst price surges, they fail to influence prices negatively. While it is typical of a token to observe a decline in its price if large entities shed their holdings, MKR price is holding steady. A wallet address identified as inveteratus.eth on the blockchain sold 1,230 MKR worth 1.78 million USDC and secured a 30% profit of $418,000 within less than a month.

Yesterday, an emergency proposal appeared on the MakerDAO @skyecosystem forum and voting portal. This proposal, which has passed but still pending timelock, dramatically increases both the amount and the LTV that Maker will lend against its own gov token.

Maker tokens worth $17 million burnt, support gains The second market mover for MKR this week is the $17 million token burn, identified on the blockchain. When a large volume of tokens is burnt, they are removed from the supply permanently, and they reduce the selling pressure, supporting price gains.

The meme coin is facing massive sell pressure at the moment, prompting more bearish Dogecoin price movement. Smart market players have identified Panshibi (SHIBI) as the perfect Dogecoin alternative. The Asian-backed meme coin has maintained a positive outlook despite market conditions, and analysis suggests early presale investors could gain 100x from it. Let’s see what the Dogecoin price prediction says in comparison to Panshibi (SHIBI) Dogecoin Risks Further Price Drop As Sell Pressure Increases If the current trend persists, the Dogecoin dip could worsen in the coming days. Short-term Dogecoin holders are already abandoning the coin, as the new Panshibi (SHIBI) looks better primed for an imminent bullish run. The DOGE sell-off is affecting the meme coin's upward momentum, but Dogecoin has maintained its consolidation zone around $0.24 - $0.25 since last week. Despite Grayscale's ETF filing for several altcoins, including Dogecoin, demand on the meme coin has been unimpressive as bearish market trends persist. Technical analysis also identified a death cross on the meme coin, signaling an imminent bearish run. While the popular Dogecoin price prediction targets a surge to $1, recent market trends highlight a potential dip below $0.1. With growing volatility on DOGE, holders have been quick to explore other market opportunities to deliver better returns for investors in the short and long run. Panshibi (SHIBI) To Rally Impressively Soon, Despite General Market Woes Presale tokens are seemingly the best investment types in the crypto market. Even in high market volatility, they offer controlled market parameters that almost guarantee profit for early buyers. The ongoing Stage 4 Panshibi presale is an opportunity for early investors to get in cheap ahead of a higher listing price. Panshibi (SHIBI) is set for 15 presale stages over 60 days, and the ongoing Stage 4 is selling out fast at $0.005. While this entry allows investors to secure over 400% gains before the $0.026 listing, the bigger profit margin is available after the token launch. Panshibi is a new panda-themed meme coin that leverages its Asian influence to grow. To increase engagement in its community, the project will introduce quests, contests, and other reward-backed activities. To achieve this, the meme coin will integrate artificial intelligence (AI) with its Social-Fi mechanism. The new meme coin is currently enjoying much interest, and the fact that it's well-audited and declared safe by Coinsult has added to investors' confidence in it. Panshibi is expected to enjoy higher adoption, and early adopters may gain the most from the token. Additionally, Panshibi will implement a ten-year liquidity lock and lock team tokens for two years, establishing a long-term commitment to the project’s success. Once the presale is over, the Panshibi team will also renounce contract ownership. Conclusion Dogecoin (DOGE) is already at a market size without a margin for 100x gains. Therefore, investors are betting on the more promising prospect of a 100x profit on Panshibi (SHIBI) as the new meme coin does impressive numbers on presale. Unlike Dogecoin, Panshibi (SHIBI) is building momentum from presale and is likely to maintain it when it hits exchanges. The Panda-themed meme coin looks ready to yield good returns, and its prospects are clear for all to see.

This downward momentum casts doubt over the coin's future price trends. In the midst of this downturn, the Panshibi (SHIBI) token has caught the attention of shrewd investors seeking alternatives. Despite widespread market challenges, Panshibi maintains a bright outlook, with projections suggesting potential exponential growth for early presale participants. Considering the current Dogecoin forecast and contrasting it with the optimistic predictions for Panshibi (SHIBI) provides intriguing insights. The Uncertain Path for Dogecoin Amid Rising Sell-offs As selling pressure intensifies, Dogecoin faces the possibility of further depreciation. Investors are turning to Panshibi (SHIBI) for its potential upswing, as the established meme coin struggles to break past the $0.24 - $0.25 zone. Despite efforts like Grayscale's ETF initiatives for Dogecoin, the prevailing bearish sentiment poses challenges. Furthermore, technical indicators hint at potential downturns, marking a cautious outlook for its trajectory. While ambitions of a $1 price tag for Dogecoin exist, volatile conditions suggest a dip closer to $0.1 might be on the horizon. Such fluctuations are driving investors towards more promising ventures that promise lucrative returns in both short and long-term scopes. Panshibi (SHIBI) Sets the Stage for Remarkable Growth Despite Market Hurdles Cryptocurrency presales, with their predictable settings, have attracted those keen on securing early gains amidst market unpredictability. Panshibi's Stage 4 presale offers a gateway to potential profitability at attractive rates. Panshibi (SHIBI) is structured for 15 strategic presale stages, with the current phase advancing swiftly at a $0.005 rate. Investors anticipate substantial gains post-listing, but the true value lies beyond the presale. The Asian-themed panda coin capitalizes on its cultural allure, incorporating features like AI-driven Social-Fi components to boost community engagement through interactive events and rewards. Its rigorous audit process by Coinsult enhances its credibility and investor trust. Further securing its foundation, Panshibi has committed to locking liquidity and team tokens to ensure sustained growth. Post-presale, the project's commitment extends to relinquishing contract ownership, solidifying its long-term vision. Final Thoughts With Dogecoin's current market ceiling hindering dramatic returns, investors are eagerly eyeing the potential windfall that comes with Panshibi (SHIBI). This new entrant in the meme coin domain is making waves, thanks to its strategic presale success. Where Dogecoin falls short, Panshibi (SHIBI) shines by leveraging its early market momentum and anticipated post-listing performance.

Optimists believe this could represent the start of a more general upward movement, backed by Cardano’s strong technical updates in 2024 and thorough plans for 2025. So, is this optimism reasonable to have, or should holders be more cautious? Cardano Price Prediction 2025: Can ADA Really Double? Cardano (ADA) has had a volatile ride in recent months, but analysts remain optimistic about its long-term potential. With key network upgrades in the pipeline, many experts believe ADA could double in value by 2025, potentially hitting $1.50 to $2.00 as adoption grows. One major factor supporting this Cardano price prediction is the blockchain’s commitment to scalability and decentralization. The upcoming Ouroboros Leios upgrade is set to increase transaction throughput, improving efficiency and making Cardano more competitive with Ethereum. Additionally, the move toward full governance, reinforced by the Plomin Hard Fork and Lace Wallet expansion, could attract more developers and institutional investors to the ecosystem. On-chain data suggests that Cardano accumulation is rising. The number of addresses holding between 1 million and 10 million ADA has steadily increased , signaling that whales are positioning themselves for long-term gains. Currently, Cardano’s market cap sits at $26.58 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $879.83 million, demonstrating strong liquidity and continued investor interest So, is a 2x Cardano price prediction realistic for 2025? If scalability upgrades roll out smoothly and institutional interest continues growing, a strong rally is definitely on the table.

This has led this Dogecoin analyst to believe a $50 billion market cap for DOGE is within reach. In addition, the potential introduction of a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has generated considerable excitement for the meme coin mania. The Dogecoin analyst predicted that a DOGE ETF could drive the price of Dogecoin up to $15 despite on-chain metrics suggesting stagnation. Furthermore, the prospect of Donald Trump’s re-election as U.S. President and the Federal Reserve’s decision to lower interest rates have created a favorable environment for crypto growth.

Particularly, so far, BTC has managed to regain some of the losses shedded in recent weeks with its price now hovering above $98,000, marking a 2.6% increase in the past 7 days. Alongside this price movement, new data have emerged highlighting significant activity among large holders on exchanges, suggesting a shift in market dynamics. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Climbs—Is a Market Breakout Around the Corner? Bitfinex Whales Show Increased Activity A CryptoQuant analyst known as Mignolet has recently shared a detailed outlook on exchange whales and their influence on the current price action in Bitcoin. Mignolet’s observations focus on leverage ratios across major trading platforms. According to his analysis, the “all exchange leverage ratio” is at an all-time high. This measure, which captures the amount of leverage being used on exchanges, reflects heightened activity that could precede significant price moves. Interestingly, while Binance has seen its leverage ratio drop back to levels last seen during last year’s consolidation phase, Bitfinex tells a different story. On Bitfinex, leverage ratios have surged sharply, aligning with a rise in open interest. Mignolet highlights that this activity points to a sudden increase in whale movements within the ongoing consolidation range. While these leverage ratios alone don’t guarantee a specific price direction, the sharp uptick on Bitfinex suggests a shift in market dynamics that bears watching. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, the question now is: What are these whales aiming for? Mignolet’s analysis stops short of providing a definitive answer, but it raises the possibility of a major price shift soon. With Bitcoin’s price holding steady above $98,000, the actions of these large-scale traders could influence whether the market breaks higher or retreats back into a more extended consolidation phase. Bitcoin Encounters Potential Strong Support Zone Meanwhile, Bitcoin has continued to inch closer to the six-digit price mark which it recently fell below in the previous week. Although the asset is still roughly an 8.7% decrease away from its all-time high (ATH) above $109,000 established in January, it has managed to see an uptick in price in the past few days. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $98,091 marking a 1.2% increase in price over the past day. According to data from IntoTheBlock, the asset appears to be seeing a formation of a “massive demand zone just below the current price.” IntoTheBlock highlighted that should the market face further downward pressure around this area, the zone may act as strong support.

Amidst these market dynamics, Web3Bay is confronting a critical issue: the prevalence of online shopping fraud. Web3Bay employs a smart contract-based escrow system that acts as a robust safeguard for both buyers and sellers, ensuring that payments are released only once contractual conditions are satisfied. This system also combats the issue of falsified reviews by utilizing blockchain technology for verification, thereby fostering increased trust in online marketplaces. Web3Bay’s Smart Contract Escrow System: Transforming Security in Online Retail The menace of online shopping scams is escalating, with consumers and merchants facing losses in the billions due to fraudulent listings and payment disputes. Web3Bay’s response is a blockchain-driven escrow mechanism that not only secures transactions but also safeguards against fraudulent activities by both parties. By automating the transaction process, the platform ensures that funds are transferred only after both buyer and seller have met the agreed-upon terms. This security is further enhanced by Web3Bay’s approach to tackling counterfeit reviews, a significant issue in e-commerce. The platform ensures that only verified purchasers can leave reviews, which minimizes the chances of manipulation and boosts the integrity of online feedback. This transparency not only increases consumer trust but also promotes fairness among businesses. Amidst its ongoing presale, Web3Bay has successfully sold over 370 million coins, raising $1.5 million and progressing to stage 4 of its token offering at a price of $0.004562625 per token. This robust presale activity underscores the market’s growing interest in blockchain solutions that address fraud prevention. Uniswap’s (UNI) Price Predictions: Looking Towards 2025 As of February 15, 2025, Uniswap (UNI) stands at $9.79, marking a minor decline of 4.21% from its last closing price. The past year has seen UNI’s price undergo substantial swings, reflecting its volatile nature. Future projections for UNI suggest it could oscillate between $7.95 and $16.26 in the coming year, potentially realizing a growth of up to 63.59%. These estimates derive from comprehensive market analysis and historical trends, though they warrant cautious consideration due to the inherent unpredictability of the cryptocurrency sector. Investors are encouraged to keep abreast of ongoing market trends and perform detailed analyses before engaging in trading activities. While growth prospects for UNI are plausible, it’s imperative to weigh the potential risks and market forces that could influence its trajectory. Hedera (HBAR): On the Verge of a Market Uptrend Currently, Hedera (HBAR) is priced at $0.227554, showing a nominal decrease of 0.03534% from its previous closing. The trading session saw HBAR reach a high of $0.239214 and dip to a low of $0.227527. Technical analysis suggests that HBAR might be wrapping up its corrective Wave 4, with its position near the 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels hinting at an impending upward movement. The RSI indicates oversold conditions, typically a precursor to a rally. A breakout from a descending wedge on the hourly chart further points to a potential bullish phase, with target resistance levels at $0.31, $0.35, and $0.39. Conversely, a fall below $0.218 could negate this bullish forecast, with $0.177 acting as crucial support. In Conclusion While Uniswap (UNI) and Hedera (HBAR) continue their unpredictable market performance, Web3Bay is making a tangible impact on enhancing online transaction security. Beyond just analyzing price trends, Web3Bay provides concrete solutions to real-world problems faced by consumers and businesses, utilizing its escrow system to minimize fraud, avoid wrongful chargebacks, and promote equitable dealings. With its blockchain-validated system bolstering confidence in online reviews, Web3Bay introduces much-needed transparency to e-commerce.

In a post on X, Martinez shared a chart highlighting a potential buy signal on XLM’s hourly chart, based on the TD Sequential indicator. #Stellar $XLM is ready to rebound as the TD Sequential indicator shows a buy signal on the hourly chart! pic.twitter.com/qFvbOkvD02 — Ali (@ali_charts) February 21, 2025 The TD Sequential Buy Signal Traders use the TD Sequential indicator to identify potential trend reversals. On the hourly chart of XLM/USDT, the signal appears as a green “1” candle following a red “9” count, which typically suggests that selling pressure has been exhausted and a price reversal could be imminent. Martinez’s chart reflects this setup, with a black arrow marking the point where the buy signal was triggered. The chart also shows a period of downward price movement leading up to the signal, followed by several small-bodied candles indicating consolidation. If the TD Sequential setup plays out as expected, XLM could see a short-term upward move. Recent Price Action and Market Context When the chart was published, XLM traded at approximately $0.33944 on Binance. The price had previously declined, forming a series of lower highs and lower lows, but the emergence of the buy signal could indicate a shift in momentum. Technical traders often seek confirmation before acting on a TD Sequential buy signal. A bullish candle following the signal, increased trading volume, or a break above key resistance levels would strengthen the case for a rebound. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Analyst Ali Martinez’s Broader Market Outlook Ali Martinez actively provides cryptocurrency market analysis, covering various assets beyond XLM. Recently, he has also made notable predictions about XRP. In one of his analyses , he suggested that XRP is “ready for an upswing” based on market structure and technical indicators. In another, he pointed to a cup-and-handle pattern on XRP’s chart , which could signal a major breakout above $3. Additionally, Martinez highlighted a critical support level for XRP , stating that a retest of the $3 level could be on the horizon if it holds. While these predictions focus on XRP, his overall analytical approach remains consistent across different cryptocurrencies. What’s Next for XLM? While the TD Sequential indicator provides a buy signal, traders should remain cautious and seek further confirmation. Market sentiment, broader cryptocurrency trends, and external factors such as macroeconomic conditions can all influence XLM’s price movement. If buying pressure increases and the price starts forming higher highs, XLM could confirm the reversal and move toward resistance levels around $0.345 or higher. However, if the price fails to gain upward momentum, the buy signal may not play out as expected, and further downside could be possible.

Shouting “dismantle the finance ministry!” attendees brandished signs saying things like “we are not your ATM” and mocking prime minister Shigeru Ishiba. Compared to other demonstrations and protests around the world, Friday evening’s (JST) MinFin protest may be seen as relatively tame, but by Japan’s typically polite standards, the growing anger is palpable. Around 1,000 people were estimated to have attended, according to participants. A small but swelling crowd chanted “demolish the ministry!” in unison in one video shared to social media, with the ostensible poster of the film noting the heavy police presence. Lightning Network advocate and Blockstream Japan leader Koji Higashi posted to X that the protest was “so exciting.” Others noted a stark lack of media coverage other than TV Tokyo, and indeed, coverage even at the time of writing is sparse. At a previous “demolish the finance ministry” event on February 17, a high school student visiting Tokyo for university entrance exams expressed frustration at the current statist paradigm, saying that he was sleeping in a park as hotels are now too expensive, and consumption tax keeps going up, while corporations are given breaks. “[The politicians] say if enterprise gets richer, we’ll all get richer. But is anyone here rich?” he asked to a passionate gathering of supporters. A sign at the protest reads: “The citizens are not your ATM.” Source: X . Reasons for the anger, Bitcoin advocates in attendance The February 21 protest is reportedly the fifth of its kind around Japan, and individual reasons for attending seem to be myriad. The 2016, Abe-era Moritomo Gakuen scandal in which the finance ministry admitted to falsifying documents, and essentially cheating the public out of money, is once again in the news . Beyond this issue, as Cryptopolitan has reported previously, residents of Japan are increasingly suffering palpable fiscal pain from inflation, overtourism, skyrocketing food prices, ostensible rice “shortages,” unlivable or non-existent pensions for the elderly, and a government and new prime minister that is hellbent on dumping literal trillions of yen into overseas initiatives and war, instead of helping the people. A street-side display at the “Demolish the Ministry of Finance” demonstration, featuring unflattering images of Japan’s prime minister Shigeru Ishiba. Source: X . “When I thought about the suffering of the people, with children unable to eat three meals a day and sales of rice seasoning at an all-time high, I started screaming and crying,” one protest attendee posted to social media , along with a video. Rice seasoning called furikake is often used in Japan to make cheap, plain meals consisting of mostly just rice, more palatable. Bitcoin advocates also attended the event via their own “Bitcoin Demo” in the same area. However, much like the murky origins of the “demolish the finance ministry” protests, it’s not immediately clear who these individuals are, or what their true agendas may be. Everyday individuals on the ground seemed to be protesting in earnest, but other elements of the demo could be construed by some as “ controlled opposition .” BTC “rebels” illogically appeal to Japanese to “pay taxes in Bitcoin” as a means to stop state spending. Source: X. For example, one photo shared by Blockstream Japan’s Koji Higashi shows a group of demonstrators in Guy Fawkes masks advising people to “pay your taxes with Bitcoin” — hardly the cypher-punk crypto freedom ethos their image might suggest, as BTC is now championed by banks and governments worldwide, including in Japan. And they’d be paying the exact entities they have deemed fiscally irresponsible. Like much cookie-cutter rebellion in the land of the rising sun, aesthetics and images are borrowed from the West, and adopted outrage which is out-of-place or counterproductive is the result. Whatever intentions may be, true crypto advocates are right about one thing: peer-to-peer, permissionless electronic cash with privacy protocols in place can indeed be a means to rein in and completely stop political spending.

However, after a much-hyped launch, the price experienced a sharp drop, falling by 65%. At the time of writing, Pi Coin is trading at $0.75 and has seen a decline of more than 7% in the past 24 hours. Despite the aggressive selling pressure fueled by market uncertainty, analysts, including Kim Wong, remain hopeful about the coin’s future trajectory. Initial Trading Activity and Price Movements When Pi Coin first launched on February 20, it traded at $2, reaching a high of $2.20 and a low of $0.09. Since then, its price has been relatively volatile, and as of February 22, Pi Coin has been trading within a range of $0.60 to $0.80. According to Wong , once Pi Coin manages to break above the $0.80 mark, it is likely to quickly move toward the $1 range. Once it surpasses $1, the $2 level could be within reach. A possible trigger for such a breakout could come from news regarding a Binance listing or progress in Pi’s ecosystem development. Disappointment and Market Misunderstandings Some early investors have voiced their disappointment over what they perceive as a low price for Pi Coin. However, this low price may be misleading, primarily due to confusion surrounding the circulating supply. The market has listed Pi’s circulating supply at 6.35 billion coins, which represents the total number of migrated Pi. However, the actual number of unlocked Pi is only 554 million coins, a figure that should be considered as the true circulating supply. Many new investors may not be aware of this distinction, but once they do, analysts believe the price of Pi could rise significantly — possibly ten times its current value. Pi Coin’s Relative Value in the Crypto Market Even at a price of $0.72, Pi Coin’s valuation is considered by some experts to be reasonable. For comparison, other projects with similar circulating supplies, such as Supra, are trading at a much lower price of $0.012. Projects with a similar supply, like Pi Coin, typically have higher initial listings. This makes Pi Coin’s current price quite favorable when compared to other crypto assets with similar supply and market factor.",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|ZRX|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 03:32:08

Get ready for a game-changer! Apple’s latest iOS 18.4 developer beta introduces ‘Priority Notifications,’ a smart feature powered by the groundbreaking Apple Intelligence . This innovative update promises to transform how you manage alerts, ensuring you stay focused on what’s important without missing crucial updates. Let’s dive into how this feature will revolutionize your iPhone Notifications experience. Unveiling Priority Notifications: How Does Apple Intelligence Enhance Alert Management? Imagine a world where your iPhone intelligently filters through the noise, presenting only the notifications that demand your immediate attention. That’s precisely what ‘Priority Notifications’ aims to deliver. Powered by Apple Intelligence , this feature analyzes your notifications and categorizes them based on importance. Instead of a chronological list, your Lock Screen will now feature a dedicated section for these prioritized alerts. Think of it as having a smart assistant managing your digital interruptions. Here’s a breakdown of how Priority Notifications changes the notification game: Intelligent Prioritization: Apple Intelligence algorithms work behind the scenes to determine which notifications are most relevant to you. This means messages from close contacts, urgent app alerts, or time-sensitive reminders are more likely to be flagged as ‘priority.’ Separate Lock Screen Section: Important notifications are neatly organized in their own section on the Lock Screen, ensuring they don’t get lost in the shuffle of less critical alerts. Chronological View Still Available: Don’t worry about missing anything! You can still swipe up to access the traditional chronological view of all your notifications, ensuring complete oversight. Reduced Digital Clutter: By filtering out less important notifications, ‘Priority Notifications’ helps minimize distractions, allowing you to focus on tasks at hand and improve your overall digital well-being. Mastering Notification Management : Enabling and Customizing Priority Notifications in iOS 18.4 Ready to take control of your iPhone Notifications with this smart feature? Enabling ‘Priority Notifications’ in iOS 18.4 is straightforward. While the feature is initially turned off by default, activating it is a breeze through your iPhone settings. This user-friendly approach puts you in charge of when and how you want to experience prioritized alerts. Follow these simple steps to enable Priority Notifications: Open Settings App: Locate and tap the ‘Settings’ app icon on your iPhone’s home screen. Navigate to Notifications: Scroll down and select the ‘Notifications’ option within the Settings menu. Find ‘Prioritize Notifications’: Look for the ‘Prioritize Notifications’ section within the Notifications settings. Toggle it On: Simply toggle the switch to the ‘on’ position to activate the ‘Priority Notifications’ feature powered by Apple Intelligence . Once enabled, you’ll immediately start experiencing a more streamlined notification experience. The intelligent filtering will begin working, and you’ll notice important alerts surfacing to the top, right where you need them. Beyond Priority Notifications : What Else is New in iOS 18.4 and Apple’s AI Push? iOS 18.4 isn’t just about smarter notifications. Apple’s developer beta release hints at a broader push towards integrating Apple Intelligence across its ecosystem. The announcement that Apple Intelligence is also coming to Vision Pro as part of visionOS 2.4 further emphasizes this commitment. This expansion suggests a future where AI-driven features become increasingly central to the Apple experience, enhancing user interaction and device functionality across various platforms. In addition to Priority Notifications and Vision Pro integration, Apple also unveiled Apple News+ Food. This upcoming section within Apple News+ will allow users to search and save recipes from numerous publishing partners, showcasing Apple’s continued diversification of its services and content offerings. The Impact of Smart Notification Management : Benefits and Future Implications The introduction of ‘Priority Notifications’ in iOS 18.4 signals a significant step forward in Notification Management . By leveraging Apple Intelligence , Apple is directly addressing the growing concern of notification overload and its impact on user focus and productivity. This feature offers several key benefits: Enhanced Focus and Productivity: By minimizing distractions from unimportant notifications, users can better concentrate on their tasks, leading to increased productivity. Reduced Digital Fatigue: Constant notification bombardment can lead to digital fatigue and stress. ‘Priority Notifications’ helps alleviate this by filtering out the noise. Improved User Experience: A more organized and intelligent notification system contributes to a smoother and more enjoyable user experience on iPhones. Potential for Further AI Integration: ‘Priority Notifications’ is likely just the beginning. We can expect to see even more sophisticated AI-powered features integrated into iPhone Notifications and other aspects of iOS in the future. As Apple Intelligence continues to evolve, features like ‘Priority Notifications’ will become increasingly refined and personalized, adapting to individual user needs and preferences. This move towards intelligent automation in Notification Management is not just a convenience; it’s a crucial step in creating a more user-centric and less disruptive mobile experience. Embrace the Future of iPhone Notifications with iOS 18.4 With iOS 18.4 and ‘Priority Notifications,’ Apple is handing users the reins to master their digital world. This Apple Intelligence -powered feature is poised to redefine how we interact with our iPhones, moving away from notification chaos towards a more controlled and focused experience. By intelligently filtering and prioritizing alerts, ‘Priority Notifications’ promises to be a valuable tool for anyone seeking to reclaim their attention and enhance their digital well-being. Keep an eye out for the public release of iOS 18.4 to experience this transformative feature firsthand and unlock the full potential of smart Notification Management .

40669776,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=132991,1740196228,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealing Court Documents: Meta’s Risky AI Training Tactics Using Copyrighted Content,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/meta-risky-ai-copyright-content/,"In a startling revelation shaking the foundations of AI ethics, court documents unsealed this week expose internal discussions at Meta regarding the use of copyrighted materials for training their cutting-edge AI models. This news arrives amidst growing concerns in the cryptocurrency and tech world about the ethical sourcing of data powering artificial intelligence. As blockchain technology grapples with its own copyright and intellectual property challenges, this case throws a spotlight on the broader AI landscape and its potential pitfalls. Are tech giants like Meta pushing the boundaries of legality in their relentless pursuit of AI dominance? The Heart of the Matter: Meta’s AI Training Data Dilemma The lawsuit, Kadrey v. Meta , is a landmark case in the burgeoning field of AI copyright law. Plaintiffs, including prominent authors Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates, are challenging Meta’s assertion of “fair use” when it comes to training AI models on copyrighted books. Previous filings indicated CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s approval for using copyrighted works and a halt to licensing talks. However, these newly unsealed documents provide a far more granular and concerning look into Meta’s internal strategies. They consist largely of internal work chats between Meta employees, painting a vivid picture of how the tech giant might have incorporated copyrighted data into models like the Llama family. Let’s break down the key revelations from these court filings: “Ask Forgiveness, Not Permission” Mentality: A Meta research engineer, Xavier Martinet, explicitly suggested an “ask forgiveness, not permission” approach to acquiring books for Meta AI training data . This suggests a deliberate strategy to bypass traditional licensing and risk potential legal repercussions later. Retail Ebooks as Training Sets: Martinet proposed purchasing ebooks at retail price to circumvent licensing agreements with publishers, highlighting a potential loophole exploitation strategy for gathering copyrighted content AI training material. Dismissal of Legal Risks: Despite acknowledging the potential for legal challenges, Martinet downplayed these concerns by pointing to the likely widespread use of “pirated books” by AI startups. This reveals a potentially reckless attitude towards copyright law within Meta’s AI research teams. Libgen and the Pursuit of State-of-the-Art AI Models Perhaps the most alarming revelation is the discussion around using Libgen, a notorious “links aggregator” known for providing access to copyrighted works. Internal communications reveal that some Meta decision-makers considered Libgen “essential to meet SOTA numbers” (State-of-the-Art) for their AI models. Sony Theakanath, a Meta product management director, emphasized Libgen’s importance for achieving top-tier AI performance. This underscores the immense pressure within Meta to compete at the highest levels of AI development, even if it means venturing into legally murky territories to acquire Libgen AI data . To mitigate potential legal fallout from using sources like Libgen, Meta reportedly considered these “mitigations”: Data Scrubbing: Removing data from Libgen that was “clearly marked as pirated/stolen.” However, the effectiveness of such a superficial scrubbing process in addressing underlying copyright issues remains questionable. Non-Disclosure: Concealing the use of Libgen datasets in public disclosures about their AI models. This raises serious questions about transparency and ethical reporting in AI development. “IP Risky Prompts” and Data Scarcity Further complicating matters, the filings suggest Meta tuned its models to avoid “IP risky prompts.” This involved programming models to refuse requests that might directly reveal their training data sources or reproduce copyrighted content verbatim, such as asking for excerpts from copyrighted books. This reactive measure highlights an awareness of the legal sensitivities surrounding their AI model training lawsuit but also points to a potentially superficial approach to addressing the core copyright concerns. Moreover, the documents indicate that Meta’s leadership considered “overriding” previous decisions against using certain data sources, including Quora content and licensed books, due to a perceived need for “more data.” Chaya Nayak, a Meta product management director, stated that first-party data from Facebook and Instagram was insufficient, revealing a potential data scarcity problem driving the exploration of ethically and legally questionable data acquisition methods. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and Copyright? Meta’s aggressive stance, evidenced by hiring Supreme Court litigators for their defense team, signals the high stakes involved in this legal battle. The outcome of Kadrey v. Meta could set significant precedents for how copyrighted content AI training is legally viewed and regulated in the future. For the cryptocurrency community and the broader tech world, this case serves as a critical reminder of the ethical and legal complexities intertwined with rapid AI advancement. Here are some key takeaways: Legal Precedent: The case could establish crucial legal boundaries for the use of copyrighted material in AI training. Ethical Implications: It raises profound ethical questions about data sourcing, transparency, and the responsibilities of AI developers. Industry Impact: The outcome could significantly influence how AI companies approach data acquisition and licensing in the future. Transparency Concerns: The revelations about non-disclosure of data sources highlight the need for greater transparency in AI development practices. As the legal proceedings unfold, the world watches to see if Meta’s pursuit of AI innovation will be deemed “fair use” or a reckless disregard for copyright law. The implications for the future of AI development and the rights of content creators are immense.

Crypto fund manager Canary Capital is making waves once again in the digital asset investment space. They’ve just submitted an amended S-1 form to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a highly anticipated exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks HBAR, the native cryptocurrency of the innovative Hedera Network. This development, spotlighted by Bloomberg’s ETF expert Eric Balchunas on X, signals a significant step forward in bringing HBAR closer to mainstream investment avenues. Could this be the breakthrough the Hedera community has been waiting for? Let’s dive into the details of this exciting development. What’s the Buzz Around the HBAR ETF Filing? For those unfamiliar, an S-1 form is a crucial document in the U.S. It’s the initial registration statement that companies must file with the SEC before they can offer securities, like an ETF, to the public. Canary Capital’s amended S-1 filing indicates they are actively pursuing the launch of an HBAR ETF , a financial product that would allow investors to gain exposure to HBAR without directly holding the cryptocurrency itself. This is a big deal because ETFs can make investing in crypto more accessible to a wider range of investors, including institutional players who often prefer regulated and familiar investment vehicles. This isn’t Canary Capital’s first rodeo with crypto ETFs. They previously navigated a similar process for a Litecoin (LTC) ETF, showcasing their experience in this complex regulatory landscape. However, it’s important to note that while the amended S-1 is a positive step, a Form 19b-4, which is also required for ETF approval and is filed by the exchange listing the ETF, has not yet been submitted for the HBAR ETF . This means there are still regulatory hurdles to clear before the ETF can become a reality. Why is a Crypto ETF a Game Changer? Crypto ETFs represent a significant evolution in the cryptocurrency market. They bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. Here’s why they are considered so important: Accessibility: ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible to retail investors through brokerage accounts they already use. No need to navigate crypto exchanges or worry about wallet security. Regulation and Security: ETFs operate within a regulated framework, offering investors a sense of security and oversight that may be lacking in the often-unregulated crypto space. Diversification: A crypto ETF focused on HBAR would allow investors to diversify their portfolios and gain exposure to the potential of the Hedera Network without needing to invest directly in HBAR and manage private keys. Institutional Investment: Many institutional investors are restricted from directly holding cryptocurrencies. ETFs provide a compliant and familiar way for them to enter the crypto market, potentially bringing significant capital inflows. Hedera Network: The Foundation of the HBAR ETF At the heart of this ETF buzz is the Hedera Network, a public distributed ledger platform that positions itself as a faster, more secure, and more energy-efficient alternative to traditional blockchains. Hedera Network utilizes Hashgraph, a patented distributed ledger technology, which offers several key advantages: Feature Hedera Hashgraph Traditional Blockchain Transaction Speed Thousands of transactions per second Slower, often single-digit TPS Transaction Cost Low, fixed fees Variable, often higher fees Energy Efficiency Highly energy-efficient More energy-intensive Security Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) Probabilistic finality in some cases HBAR, the native cryptocurrency of Hedera Network , fuels the ecosystem and is used for network services like transactions, smart contracts, and file storage. The network has been gaining traction with various real-world applications, from supply chain management to decentralized identity solutions, making an ETF tracking its performance an increasingly appealing prospect for investors. Canary Capital’s Strategic Move in the Crypto Space Canary Capital ‘s persistent efforts to launch crypto ETFs, starting with Litecoin and now HBAR, highlight their strategic vision for the future of digital asset investment. Their amended S-1 for the HBAR ETF, following their initial filing in November, demonstrates their commitment and belief in the long-term potential of both HBAR and the broader crypto market. By proactively navigating the complex SEC regulatory process, Canary Capital is positioning itself as a key player in bringing innovative crypto investment products to market. The fact that they are following a similar process to their Litecoin ETF application could suggest a degree of familiarity and potentially increased efficiency in their approach. However, the SEC’s stance on crypto ETFs remains cautious, and the absence of a Form 19b-4 filing for the HBAR ETF underscores that regulatory approval is not guaranteed. The crypto community will be watching closely for further developments. What’s Next for the Anticipated HBAR ETF? The submission of the amended S-1 is undoubtedly a positive step, but it’s just one piece of the puzzle. The next key milestone to watch for is the filing of the Form 19b-4 by an exchange seeking to list the HBAR ETF . This form essentially requests permission from the SEC for the exchange to list and trade the ETF shares. Once both the S-1 and 19b-4 are under review, the SEC will then assess whether the proposed ETF meets the necessary regulatory requirements for investor protection and market integrity. The timeline for SEC review and potential approval is uncertain and can vary significantly. The crypto ETF landscape in the U.S. is still evolving, and while there’s growing optimism, regulatory hurdles remain. However, Canary Capital’s continued efforts and the increasing institutional interest in crypto suggest that the path towards a crypto ETF for HBAR, and potentially other digital assets, is gradually becoming clearer. Conclusion: A Hopeful Sign for HBAR and Crypto ETFs Canary Capital’s amended S-1 filing for an HBAR ETF is a significant development that injects renewed optimism into the crypto market, particularly for the Hedera community. It represents a tangible step towards greater accessibility and mainstream adoption of HBAR. While regulatory approval is not a certainty and further steps are needed, this move underscores the growing momentum behind crypto ETFs and the increasing recognition of digital assets as a legitimate investment class.

However the signing message was to change… — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) February 21, 2025 “However, the signing message was to change the smart contract logic of our ETH cold wallet,” posited Zhou. “[The] hacker took control of the specific ETH cold wallet we signed and transferred all ETH in the cold wallet to this unidentified address.” Shortly afterward, Zhou reassured users and the broader crypto industry that it would be able to deal with the loss. “Bybit is solvent even if this hack loss is not recovered, all of clients’ assets are 1 to 1 backed, we can cover the loss,” he wrote , adding that all other cold wallets were secure and withdrawals were normal. Flashbots strategy head Hasu also observed on X that the hack has not doomed Bybit. “If you want my serious take, Bybit has way more than 1.4 billion of revenue per year,” Hasu opined . “They are good for the money and will make all customers whole. It doesn’t matter for ETH because Bybit will honor customers’ ETH liabilities and buy back the assets on the open market.” Biggest Crypto Hack In History The amount stolen from Bybit on Friday is enormous, even by crypto standards. Decentralized finance (DeFi) commentator Patrick Scott said on X that the hack represents “16% of ALL previous crypto hacks.” This Bybit exploit is the largest of all time, representing 16% of ALL previous crypto hacks. pic.twitter.com/XWs6xZvmdm — Patrick Scott | Dynamo DeFi (@Dynamo_Patrick) February 21, 2025 In 2024, Japanese-headquartered exchange DMM fell victim to the largest crypto hack of that year when hackers pilfered Bitcoin worth over $300 million at the time. Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX was hacked for over $475 million in 2022. Meanwhile, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao has offered to help Bybit while also recommending that the exchange should pause withdrawals as a security measure. “Not an easy situation to deal with. Might suggest to halt all withdrawals for a bit as a standard security precaution. Will provide any assistance if needed.

There has been widespread criticism amongst certain sectors that Ethereum is not doing enough to support blockchain casinos. Buterin responded that he would leave the crypto space if such a “moral reversal” occurred and that the very notion of a crypto casino goes against his fundamental beliefs. “Perhaps the most disappointing thing for me recently,” says Buterin, “was when someone said that Ethereum is bad and intolerant because we don’t respect the ‘casinos’ on the blockchain enough, and other chains are happy to accept any application, so they are better.” This comes at a critical time for the Ethereum Foundation. Buterin has suggested neutrality for the application layer and only limited support for specific projects. Financial concerns have consumed many discussions about the Foundation. Pure neutrality at the application layer would allow for more gambling. A more limited approach, conversely, would allow the Ethereum Foundation to uphold their own ethical standards, while making calculated and frugal decisions regarding funds. Buterin expressed disappointment at the online meetings, noticing an over-focus on issues such as crypto gambling. But he conceded that when he meets people in person they often express similar views to him, having a moral focus on the issue of casinos, rather than a purely financial concern. There may be other issues that Buterin is addressing by targeting online casinos. He may be taking a swipe at other tokens like Solana that have promoted meme coins without restraint. There may be other so-called ‘Ethereum killer’ tokens that Buterin is taking a swipe at. Perhaps the ‘ethical approach’, according to this perspective at least, is a case of sour grapes. The Ethereum price, after all, has been struggling in comparison to other tokens. This all comes as the Ethereum Foundation changes its strategy concerning funding, responding to concerns of the community that the foundation should fund projects with decentralized finance instead of merely selling Ethereum tokens. The foundation responded to this request by allocating 45,000 ETH, valued at $120 million, to defi solutions. This would involve funding platforms like Compound. The community agreed to the measures proposed.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News|Vitalik Buterin,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-22 04:09:19

This new challenger is fast rising with a project introduced with what has been dubbed the best crypto presale of 2025. This project delivers a PayFi solution that is quicker, easier to use and attracts lesser fees. This disruptor, Remittix (RTX) , has entered the PayFi market, making a resounding statement by enabling users to convert crypto to FIAT while making transfers to bank accounts worldwide with full control and anonymity. Remittix Presents the Best Crypto Presale of 2025 Backed by a rapidly growing community, massive investor influx and tangible real-world utilities, Remittix is fast gaining a hefty portion of the global payments market and competing with established players. Its success speaks for itself, as the project’s presale has now raised over $12.6 million, and investor interest continues to increase astronomically. This achievement explains why investors say it has all the makings to become the best crypto presale of 2025 RTX tokens are currently selling at $0.0628, making this a perfect time for early investors hoping to get in before the price rises further. Key Drivers Behind Remittix’s Thriving Adoption Seamless Crypto-to-FIAT Conversion and Transfers Despite the spike in the rate of crypto adoption lately, processing times for converting digital assets into FIAT haven’t improved while remaining pricey and mostly inefficient. With traditional exchange platforms, you battle high charges, lengthy withdrawal times, and cross-border transfers that feel just as restrictive as conventional banking systems. Businesses also have to deal with volatility, liquidity challenges, and the intricacies of crypto payment settlements. Enters Remittix, a new project that is getting rid of these hindrances. The PayFi platform facilitates users to instantly convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into FIAT and send funds directly to any global bank account in their preferred currency. Remittix users do not experience unexpected fees when transacting. They also enjoy full control over their money as there are no intermediaries. Users also stay anonymous when making these payments. Remittix has introduced a simple, seamless and efficient way to leverage crypto for everyday people. Finally, with Remittix, users can send crypto assets globally and their payments get reflected in their preferred FIAT currency that same day, without the additional charges or delays. Global Remittance Ease With Uncompromised Privacy While financial privacy has become more difficult to come by in the modern financial market, no thanks to banks and payment intermediaries getting increasingly scrutinized, Remittix comes with a discreet alternative that replaces traditional payment services lacking privacy. Remittix guarantees that your payment recipients get a standard bank transfer alert that reveals no trace of the payment coming from a crypto source. This process allows users to easily move their funds without having to endure invasive financial tracking. Remittix Presale Capital Soars Past $12.6 Million Remittix (RTX) is the new kid on the block, having raised over $12.6 million in only a few weeks of its record-breaking presale . As the current phase sells out fast, savvy investors can start accumulating their share of the promising RTX tokens for an affordable price of $0.0628. Thanks to the innovative upgrade this project brings to crypto-to-FIAT transactions, analysts dub its ICO the best crypto presale this year. They also predict it will deliver 800% price returns before the presale ends, with more profits expected as the project gains widespread acceptance and usage.

Among the many emerging and established cryptos, Qubetics ($TICS), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Bittensor TAO (TAO) stand out. These digital currencies aren’t just numbers on a screen—they have massive growth potential. The big question is: Which of these top cryptos will skyrocket in 2025 and beyond? Well, the answer lies in their unique use cases and market strategies. Qubetics ($TICS) is currently in its presale stage, catching eyes with its innovative solutions for cross-border transactions. It has already raised more than $13.5 million and sold over 483 million tokens, which speaks volumes about its growth trajectory. On the other hand, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) continues to maintain its place in the crypto landscape due to its low-cost and fast transaction capabilities. Bittensor TAO (TAO) is also a fascinating option, as its decentralized machine learning framework positions it as a unique crypto player. Together, they make up an exciting trio of cryptocurrencies ready for massive growth. But here’s where it gets really interesting: Qubetics isn’t just offering another digital currency for transactions—it’s solving real-world problems in the crypto space. From simplifying cross-border transactions for individuals and businesses alike, to providing scalability and efficiency, Qubetics is built to address the challenges that Bitcoin Cash and Bittensor TAO haven’t fully tackled yet. As these projects continue to develop, it’ll explore how each can pave the way for the future of digital finance. Qubetics ($TICS): Solving Real-World Problems with Blockchain Tech Qubetics isn’t just another cryptocurrency—it’s the next level of blockchain technology. Currently in its 22nd stage of presale, Qubetics has already sold over 483 million tokens, raising more than $13.5 million. And with over 20,800 holders already on board, it’s clear that this project is heating up. So, what’s all the buzz about? One of the biggest challenges in the global economy today is the inefficiency of cross-border transactions. Whether you’re a business, a freelancer, or an individual, sending money across borders can be costly, slow, and riddled with intermediaries. Qubetics aims to change that by providing a more streamlined, affordable solution. With a focus on cross-border transactions, Qubetics is creating a platform that enables businesses and individuals to send money quickly and with minimal fees. For many people, this feature is a game-changer, especially in the age of remote work and international business. What makes Qubetics different from others like Bitcoin Cash and Bittensor TAO is its emphasis on solving real-life problems. Bitcoin Cash might be fast, but its use in cross-border payments still involves certain limitations in scalability and transaction fees. Bittensor TAO, while innovative, is more focused on decentralized machine learning rather than optimizing cross-border payment systems. Qubetics ($TICS), however, bridges that gap with its blockchain solution that simplifies and speeds up cross-border transactions while ensuring security and transparency. At $0.08073 per token in this best crypto presale , many analysts are predicting substantial ROI once the presale ends, with expectations of $1 after the presale and possibly $5 post-mainnet launch. Imagine the potential here—over 6093% ROI if it reaches $5, which could create a serious buzz in the crypto space. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Keeping Speed and Low Costs at the Forefront Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was born from a hard fork of the original Bitcoin network, designed to address scalability issues and reduce transaction fees. By increasing the block size, Bitcoin Cash has been able to process transactions more efficiently compared to Bitcoin (BTC), making it a popular choice for day-to-day payments. But despite its clear advantages, BCH has its own set of challenges. One of the biggest factors that affect Bitcoin Cash’s adoption is competition. Other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Binance Coin, and even newer projects like Qubetics are vying for the top spot, offering similar or superior solutions for fast, low-cost transactions. Still, Bitcoin Cash continues to be one of the most widely used and traded altcoins, especially for those who need to make quick transactions across borders without high fees. In the face of emerging competitors, Bitcoin Cash has focused on improving scalability and expanding its network to ensure that it remains a viable alternative to traditional financial systems. Bitcoin Cash’s low transaction fees and fast speeds make it a solid contender in the world of payment-based cryptocurrencies. However, Bitcoin Cash is not without its hurdles. As the market evolves, Bitcoin Cash will need to continue innovating and adapting to the changes brought on by new technologies like Qubetics. Despite these challenges, Bitcoin Cash has shown resilience in maintaining its status as a top cryptocurrency. With steady growth and a dedicated user base, BCH is expected to remain a significant player in the crypto space for the foreseeable future. Bittensor TAO (TAO): Machine Learning Meets Decentralization Bittensor TAO (TAO) is a unique cryptocurrency that focuses on decentralized machine learning. It’s designed to allow developers to build and share machine learning models in a decentralized network, opening up opportunities for innovation in AI and blockchain. The project’s primary focus is to create a more open, scalable, and efficient way of training and deploying machine learning models, making it a highly technical yet incredibly promising blockchain solution. While Bittensor TAO is a fascinating concept, it faces a different challenge than Bitcoin Cash or Qubetics—adoption. The world of decentralized machine learning is still in its infancy, and while the potential for revolutionizing AI is immense, it may take time for Bittensor TAO to achieve widespread use. Bittensor TAO’s price and demand fluctuate based on the interest in decentralized machine learning, and its growth will largely depend on the success of its technology in attracting developers and companies to its network. The machine learning space is already competitive, with giants like Google and OpenAI leading the charge in AI development, so Bittensor TAO will need to find a unique niche to succeed in the crowded space. However, the potential for Bittensor TAO is clear. The ability to decentralize AI training and development could reshape industries, from healthcare to finance to entertainment. As move forward, it’ll likely see more use cases emerge that prove just how disruptive Bittensor TAO can be in the world of machine learning. Cross-Border Transactions: Why They’re Crucial for the Future of Finance Cross-border transactions are one of the most fundamental use cases for cryptocurrency. With traditional banks and financial institutions, sending money across borders can take days and involve steep fees. In contrast, cryptocurrency can make cross-border payments faster, cheaper, and more secure. That’s why projects like Qubetics are so important—they’re not just about offering a new digital currency, but creating a seamless financial ecosystem that addresses the real-world problems of international payments. In today’s global economy, businesses and individuals need a way to send money across borders quickly and efficiently. Cryptocurrency offers a solution to this problem by allowing transactions to be processed in minutes, rather than days. Qubetics aims to make cross-border transactions not only faster but also more accessible, reducing the barriers to entry for people in underbanked regions. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the demand for faster, more affordable cross-border payments will continue to grow. Cryptocurrencies like Qubetics are poised to meet this demand, offering a more efficient solution than traditional financial systems ever could. Conclusion: The Future of Digital Finance The cryptocurrency space is rapidly evolving, and projects like Qubetics, Bitcoin Cash, and Bittensor TAO are leading the charge in redefining how people think about money, transactions, and decentralization. With Qubetics focusing on solving real-world problems like cross-border transactions, Bitcoin Cash remaining a fast and affordable alternative to traditional payment systems, and Bittensor TAO exploring the world of decentralized machine learning, the future of crypto is looking brighter than ever. So, what’s the takeaway here? Qubetics has a unique opportunity to be the solution to a significant global challenge. If you’re looking to invest in a project with top cryptos for massive growth potential, now’s the time to get in on the Qubetics presale.

Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the country is still actively seeking membership in the economic alliance led by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa after decades of being shut out of the European Union. Speaking to Bloomberg on Friday, Fidan confirmed that Turkey is “exploring joining groups including BRICS” because it needs more economic options. “The EU was our first choice,” he said. “If we cannot be part of the EU, then other alternatives are always on the table.” Turkey, while officially a NATO member, has increasingly positioned itself as a neutral power between the East and West. The country has refused to join Western sanctions on Russia and has maintained strong trade and energy ties with Moscow, even as NATO allies criticize its decision-making. Turkey officially applied for BRICS membership in November 2024 but was only given “partner-country status,” a secondary position that does not come with voting rights or full membership benefits. Fidan made it clear that Ankara is not satisfied with that status. “We are interested, but we have not been offered a membership yet,” Fidan said at the G-20 foreign ministers’ summit in Johannesburg, South Africa on Friday. As aforementioned, Turkey’s push toward BRICS is a direct result of its longstanding failure to gain entry into the EU. The country first applied for EU membership in 1987, but its candidacy has been stuck in negotiations for over three decades now. Brussels has repeatedly blocked Ankara’s entry, citing concerns over human rights, democratic standards, and political differences. During his interview , Fidan dismissed those reasons, saying that the real issue is cultural discrimination. Ankara has long accused the EU of deliberately stalling its membership because it is a Muslim-majority nation. Turkey’s push for multilateral action is reflected in its approach to Africa, where it has forged ties with countries like Somalia on counterterrorism. “Turkey is offering an opportunity for some African countries,” Fidan said. The BRICS expansion and de-dollarization The BRICS group has added five new members in the past year, including Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Indonesia. Saudi Arabia has also been invited but has not made a final decision yet. Turkey, along with Malaysia and Thailand, is one of the latest nations who want to join the group. Fidan told Bloomberg that: “In the modern world, no one country can alone overcome economic and political issues. Self-help is on the menu for every nation-state.” Turkey is particularly interested in BRICS’s financial cooperation, which includes efforts to reduce reliance on the US dollar in global trade. The bloc has been pushing for de-dollarization, with many members already settling oil and trade transactions in their local currencies instead of the dollar. This has drawn a direct response from Donald Trump, who will return to the White House in 2025. US President Donald Trump has threatened economic retaliation against any country that ditches the greenback. “The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER. We are going to require a commitment from these seemingly hostile countries that they will neither create a new BRICS currency, nor back any other currency to replace the mighty US dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US economy,” Trump said in a Truth Social post even before he won the Nov. 5 elections. Russia and China, the two leading voices in BRICS, have been the biggest drivers of de-dollarization. Moscow, which has been cut off from Western financial systems due to US sanctions, is pushing for a BRICS-based cross-border payment system that would operate outside Washington’s influence. The New Development Bank (NDB), the BRICS-led financial institution, has also ramped up lending. Since its launch in 2015, the bank has approved nearly $33 billion in loans, focusing on infrastructure and development projects in member states. But that figure is still much lower than the World Bank’s $117.5 billion in commitments for 2024. BRICS’s ultimate goal is to create a multipolar world order, moving power away from the United States and Europe. China, in particular, has been actively pulling Global South nations into its economic orbit to challenge Western financial dominance. But the expansion has created tensions within BRICS itself as India is against it, in fears that it would turn into a pro-China alliance. Brazil was hesitant too, worried about damaging its carefully-cultivated ties with the US and Europe. When Biden was president, Russia was the leading voice behind sticking it to America, but Trump’s win might’ve messed with that plan as presidents Putin and Trump rekindle their friendship, so the former said he was no longer interested in dethroning USD.

Trump’s Statement on Cryptocurrency and the SEC A video attached to a tweet from crypto enthusiast JackTheRippler featured Trump discussing the treatment of cryptocurrency under the Biden administration. In his remarks, Trump criticized regulatory agencies, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for a “hostile” approach toward digital assets. He claimed that these agencies engaged in politically motivated indictments and only softened their stance near the end of Biden’s term due to the large number of cryptocurrency users. Trump suggested that his intervention helped many individuals who were facing legal scrutiny, stating, “I saved your life,” about those who were indicted. He framed his actions as part of a broader effort to position the United States at the forefront of technological innovation, particularly in AI and blockchain. BREAKING: Donald Trump says: “I have signed executive orders to keep the United States at the forefront of artificial intelligence and to end Joe Biden's war on Bitcoin and crypto. We ended that war totally, that war is over!” The SEC v. RIPPLE case is coming to an end! #XRP pic.twitter.com/SEUlSCafWE — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) February 20, 2025 We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Implications for the SEC v. Ripple Case One of the key takeaways from JackTheRippler’s tweet was the suggestion that the SEC v. Ripple case may soon end. The lawsuit, which began in December 2020, revolves around the SEC’s allegations that Ripple conducted an unregistered securities offering through the sale of XRP. The case has had significant implications for the regulatory landscape of digital assets. Both investors and industry participants highly anticipate its resolution. While Trump did not directly reference the SEC v. Ripple case in his remarks, his strong criticism of the agency’s actions suggests that regulatory policies could shift if he returned to office. The SEC’s treatment of cryptocurrency firms, including Ripple , has been a contentious issue, with many in the industry calling for clearer and more favorable regulations. Potential Impact on Crypto Policy Trump’s announcement signals a potential departure from the current regulatory stance on digital assets. His remarks suggest that, under his leadership, cryptocurrency could receive more government support and fewer regulatory restrictions. If this policy shift materializes, it could encourage innovation, attract institutional investors, and provide greater clarity for blockchain-based projects operating in the U.S. However, it remains to be seen how these executive orders will be implemented and what specific actions will follow. Given the complex regulatory landscape and ongoing legal battles, including the SEC v. Ripple case, the cryptocurrency community watches closely for further developments.

The shared chart focuses on historical resistance levels, Fibonacci extension points, and a multi-phase Parabolic Arc formation. XRP Eyes $6—But This Key Level Stands In The Way Egrag Crypto’s chart shows XRP trading near $2.67, coming off a notable bullish surge but now contending with a red horizontal band between roughly $2.75 and $3.00. The upper boundary at $3.00 holds dual significance: it marks a psychologically important level and also corresponds to a critical area from previous cycle peaks. A monthly close above this line would strongly suggest a bullish continuation, potentially setting the stage for a move toward the next Fibonacci extension marks. “XRP current price action is trading at $2.67, showing a strong bullish move but facing resistance at the red horizontal zone (~$2.75-$2.83-$2.910 and $3.00),” Egrag states. The analyst particularly highlights Fib 1.414 near $4.30 and Fib 1.618 around $6.40 as the next barriers if $3.00 is decisively broken. A volume surge would strengthen the bullish case and provide extra confirmation for the run to unfold. Related Reading: XRP Price Consolidation Completed: Will Wave 3 Propel Prices Beyond The $5 Barrier? Failure to overtake $3.00, however, could trigger a correction back into the $1.90–$2.00 support region identified by earlier candle closes. Egrag Crypto notes that if $1.90 fails to hold, a more extensive drop toward $0.90–$1.00 could ensue, which the analyst labels as a potential “Black Swan” scenario likely driven by broader market turmoil rather than XRP-specific weakness. Egrag writes: “Breaking below $1.90 could shift sentiment to bearish, introducing downside risks toward the $0.90-$1.00 range. This would signal a potential Black Swan event across all markets! Such a collapse would be a challenging prelude before the ignition stage for XRP. Honestly, I don’t favor this scenario, as it would be stressful for all of us, including many OGs. Could the upcoming fort knox auditing be the catalyst for this Black Swan.” Related Reading: Pundit Who Correctly Predicted XRP Price Crash To $2.5 Says Demand Zone Will Send It Soaring In the long term, the chart presents three sweeping parabolic arcs—colored yellow, green, and blue—which suggest that XRP may be building a broad-scale bullish structure. Price targets in the $33–$60 range reflect these arcs and channel extensions, though much hinges on whether a monthly close above $3.00 can usher in sustained momentum. Beyond the $6.40 level at Fib 1.618, Egrag Crypto identifies additional Fibonacci-related checkpoints, such as $8, $13, $27, and $67 (Fib 1.888). These higher levels would remain speculative until XRP clears the nearer hurdles and demonstrates stable volume influx and price structure. “Volume and momentum confirmation would be crucial in the[se] coming phases,” he adds. While the path forward depends on technical breakouts, Egrag Crypto underscores that near-term movement around $3.00 will be pivotal for setting the tone. A successful break above resistance could confirm targets in the $4–$6 window, and eventually open the door to the lofty parabolic objectives. At press time, XRP traded at $2.6198.

One such asset is Ondo (ONDO), the native token of the Ondo ecosystem. It is a decentralized finance (DeFi) network that leverages blockchain technology to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs). ONDO Dominates RWAs Space According to a tweet by the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, ONDO is currently dominating the real-world assets space. The asset has outperformed most RWA tokens and has the highest transaction volume. $ONDO is dominating the RWA space, posting the highest transaction volume and significantly outperforming other tokens, even in the current sluggish market pic.twitter.com/j7KV79dL1K — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) February 19, 2025 IntoTheBlock data shows Ondo’s transaction volume hovering close to $300 million, compared to other projects whose numbers are less than $40 million. A few weeks ago, Ondo’s transaction volume spiked to roughly $450 million before a steep plunge that saw the metric hover around $200 million. However, it has begun to rise again and is well on its way to smashing the $300 million mark. Although ONDO dominates transaction volumes, the same cannot be said for asset prices. As the fifth-largest RWA by market cap, ONDO was worth $1.23 at the time of writing, recording a slight uptick in the past 24 hours. The asset was down 7% weekly and 6% monthly, according to data from CoinMarketCap. ONDO is among the most visited tokens on CoinMarketCap, but the asset still lacks the daily and monthly momentum seen among its rivals. Ondo Records Significant Developments Nevertheless, the Ondo project has recorded several developments lately. The team recently unveiled the Ondo Chain, a layer-1 blockchain built for institutional-grade RWAs. The developers said Ondo Chain was built to end the lack of features necessary for regulated assets to thrive on-chain. The new network aims to crush infrastructure barriers for tokenized regulated securities. The barriers include incompatibility with DeFi, cross-chain liquidity fragmentation, high and volatile transaction fees, and inadequate security. Ondo Chain combines the openness of public blockchains with the compliance and security features of permissioned networks. Besides the introduction of the Ondo Chain, Ondo Finance recently secured a strategic collaboration with the U.S. President Donald Trump-backed DeFi protocol, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), to accelerate the adoption of tokenized RWAs. The alliance sees WLFI exploring the integration of Ondo’s tokenized assets into the WLFI network as treasury reserve assets.

Primarily against Bybit’s recent $1.4 billion hack, over $566 million was liquidated across the broader market in the last 24 hours. As a result, BTC price price lost nearly 2% and slipped back to the $96K level on Saturday. Further, ETH and other leading altcoins have also followed the waning trajectory. Crypto Market Today: BTC, ETH & Altcoins Suffer Amid Bybit’s Hack & Massive Liquidations Notably, the crypto exchange behemoth Bybit recently suffered an exploitation attack, resulting in the theft of $1.4 billion ETH from the platform. CoinGape reported that the mastermind behind this hack was ‘The Lazarus Group ,’ a North Korean cybercriminal organization. As a response to the hack, the crypto market saw $566.64 liquidated in the last 24 hours, per Coinglass data. The massive liquidations, underscoring panic selling, in turn brought significant heat to cryptocurrency prices. Further, the global cryptocurrency market cap slipped 1.98% from yesterday to reach $3.17 trillion. BTC Price Backtracks To $96K In sync with the colossal liquidations, BTC price witnessed a 2% loss in value over the past 24 hours, resting at $96,170. The flagship coin’s intraday bottom and peak were $94,852.96 and $99,497.97, respectively. Coinglass data showed that Bitcoin recorded $199.44 million worth of liquidations in the past 24 hours. Simultaneously, its market dominance slipped marginally by 0.01% to 60.29%. ETH Price Takes Heat Amid Crypto Market’s New Hack ETH price tanked nearly 3% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $2,674. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $2,616.92 and $2,842.83, respectively. Ethereum recorded liquidations worth $141.76 million in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, market watchers remain cautious about the coin’s future movements in light of the massive Bybit hack. Given that the hackers decide to sell the stolen funds ahead, heightened selling pressure could pull the price further down. XRP Price Cracks 3% XRP price fell by 3% intraday and is now sitting at $2.57. The coin hit a bottom and peak of $2.51 and $2.71 in the last 24 hours. Notably, the Ripple-backed asset saw liquidations worth $14.95 million over the past day and followed the broader market trend to dip in the red zone. SOL Price Slips 2% SOL price saw a 2% decline in the past 24 hours and is now trading at $170. The coin swooped to a low of $167.31 and a high of $180.43 in the last 24 hours. Solana recorded liquidations worth $22.24 million intraday, aligning with the market trend. Meme Crypto Market Also Tumbles Dogecoin: DOGE price saw a 4% drop to $0.2417 amid $14.03 million liquidated in the Dogecoin market. Shiba Inu : SHIB price waned by 2% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $0.00001516, mirroring the market trend. Even Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Official Trump (TRUMP) prices cracked 2%-5%, reaching $0.000009188 and $16.08, respectively. The meme coin market has primarily mirrored the broader market trend as the week comes to a close.

The coin has erased all the gains made in the last seven days and is down by more than 8%. According to analysts, the immediate support zone might be used as a foundation for a rally if the price continues to hold strong. There are two possible scenarios for XRP’s price movements: one where it could be nearing the end of a correction, or another where it might be starting a new phase of upward movement. The First Scenario: A Correction Almost Done? In this scenario, XRP might have completed its correction phase and is ready to begin moving higher. After a significant price drop on February 3, the market saw a rally and a subsequent pullback. If this correction has now finished, we could see XRP start moving upwards again, potentially pushing the price to new all-time highs. If this scenario plays out, price could expect the price to rise towards $3.40, which was the previous high point. However, this scenario will be invalid if the price falls below the critical level of $2.47 or the support zone at $2.52. The Second Scenario: A Deeper Pullback Ahead In the second scenario, XRP might still be in the middle of a deeper correction, and the price could fall even further before resuming its upward trend. In this case, the price might find support at levels around $2.22, $2.10, or even $1.95. If the price breaks below $2.52, this would confirm that the price is in the midst of a deeper pullback. If this happens, we could see the price target in the $2.26 to $2.31 range before any recovery begins.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 05:04:56

Bybit CEO Allegation A recent controversy stems from Ben Zhou’s comments , who pointed to a 2023 warning from Chinese police that called Pi Network a scam. The police said Pi Network targeted elderly people, collected their data, and caused financial losses, including their pensions. Additionally, Zhou also denied claims about Bybit and Pi Network.

Just as Coinbase celebrated the SEC dropping its lawsuit, Bybit got drained of $1.5 billion, the biggest crypto theft ever recorded. The Dubai-based exchange, which handles $36 billion in daily trades, confirmed the breach almost immediately as CEO Ben Zhou shared via a post on X that hackers took over an Ethereum cold wallet and emptied it into an unknown address. The hack of course shook Bitcoin up a bit as it tumbled by over 3% from $98,000 to around $96,000, according to data from CoinGecko. The Bybit hack is now fueling concerns about crypto security under deregulation. With the SEC pulling back, exchanges are facing fewer compliance checks, making them easier targets for hackers. Hilary Allen, a professor at American University, warned , “Deregulated markets sound good until you have this type of attack. In the short term, we are seeing a lot of cheering for the peeling away of a lot of regulations. But be careful what you wish for.” Meanwhile, on-chain detective ZachXBT has since traced the stolen Ethereum of Bybit to wallets linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. The notorious state-sponsored cybercrime unit has been responsible for some of the biggest crypto heists in history, including the $235 million WazirX attack and $50 million Radiant Capital breach. Lazarus follows a long-term laundering process, making fund recovery nearly impossible. They convert stolen tokens to Ethereum, swap it for Bitcoin, and mix transactions before cashing out through Chinese OTC brokers. The process can take years, and in some cases, Lazarus has been known to sit on stolen funds for over six years before moving them. Even though Bybit secured a loan to cover withdrawals, it still has to pay it back. The stolen funds are gone for good, which means Bybit will be forced to buy Ethereum on the market to settle its debts. That creates an unusual dynamic: Bybit’s buy pressure could push ETH prices up, while Lazarus dumps ETH for Bitcoin, keeping downward pressure on BTC over time. For traders, that means Ethereum may hold steady, but Bitcoin could face long-term sell pressure as North Korea slowly cashes out its gains. Bybit faces a bank run run on withdrawals Crypto traders noticed unusual outflows from Bybit before the company even made an announcement. Soon after his statement, Zhou went live on X to properly address the community. “Hacker took control of the specific ETH cold wallet we signed and transferred all ETH in the cold wallet to this unidentified address,” Zhou said. Bitget CEO Gracy Chen downplayed the impact, saying in Chinese that: “Bybit is a respectable competitor and partner. Although the loss this time is huge, it is only their annual profit. I believe that customer funds are 100% safe. There is no need to panic or run on the bank. Come on, Ben!” By then, panic had set in. Bybit faced a massive bank run, receiving 350,000 withdrawal requests within 10 hours. The flood of exits outpaced the platform’s processing speed, leaving 2,100 requests stuck in the queue as Bybit’s team worked through the night. Even though Bybit had $16.2 billion in reserves, losing $1.5 billion in Ethereum and derivatives meant 9% of its total assets were wiped out. Zhou kept reassuring users that the exchange was solvent, but traders were not taking chances. With billions gone, Bybit had to act fast to avoid insolvency fears. Rival exchange Bitget stepped in with a 40,000 ETH ($106 million) loan to help stabilize withdrawals. Bitget( @bitgetglobal ) transferred 40,000 $ETH ($106M) to Bybit( @Bybit_Official ) as a loan to handle customer withdrawals. https://t.co/FQPc0gSLxX pic.twitter.com/y5BigWoONf — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) February 22, 2025 Zhou, running on zero sleep, told users, “Since the hack, we have experienced the most number of withdrawals that we have ever seen.” Bybit’s team processed 99.994% of requests, asking customers to “leave a comment if your withdrawal is completed.” Lazarus Group launders funds for North Korea’s weapons program Security experts at Chainalysis say Lazarus funnels stolen crypto into North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile program. The group has been a top target of U.S. and U.N. sanctions, but their methods keep evolving. In 2021 alone, Lazarus stole $400 million from centralized exchanges and investment firms. Interestingly, in terms of dollar value, Bitcoin now accounts for less than one fourth of the cryptos stolen by the hackers. In 2021, only 20% of the stolen funds were Bitcoin, whereas 22% were either ERC-20 tokens or altcoins. And for the first time ever, Ether accounted for a majority of the funds stolen at 58%. The laundering process has grown more complex, with Lazarus using mixers to hide transactions. Chainalysis data shows that in 2019, only 21% of stolen funds were mixed, but by 2021, that number jumped to 65%. Chainalysis said in its report, “Chainalysis has identified $170 million in current balances—representing the stolen funds of 49 separate hacks spanning from 2017 to 2021—that are controlled by North Korea but have yet to be laundered through services.” Meanwhile, Zhou updated the users that, “12 hr from the worst hack in history. ALL withdraws have been processed. Our withdraw system is now fully back to normal pace, you can withdraw any amount and experience no delays. Thanks for your patience and we are sorry that this has happened.” He added that Bybit will come out with full incident report as well as security measurement in the next few days.

33767162,[object Object],1740202243,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Grayscale’s Ethereum ETF On The Brink Of Major Change With NYSE’s Staking Proposal,https://bitcoinist.com/grayscales-ethereum-etf-on-the-brink-major-change/,"The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has submitted a proposed rule change aimed at allowing the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (EZET) to stake their ETH holdings. This proposal is particularly noteworthy because it seeks to enable the trusts to earn rewards on their staked ETH while ensuring that the assets remain under the custody of their current custodian. Grayscale Advocates For Staking In Crypto ETFs Staking, a process integral to Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) model, allows holders to earn yield on their assets. By staking through trusted providers, ETHE and EZET could potentially bolster their returns, making these investment vehicles more attractive to institutional investors who are increasingly seeking opportunities that offer staking benefits. Unlike traditional staking-as-a-service models, which have drawn scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Grayscale claims that its approach is designed exclusively for the benefit of fund shareholders. This means that the assets will not be pooled with those of third parties, which could mitigate some regulatory concerns . Industry advocates, including organizations such as Jito Labs and Multicoin Capital, have been vocal in their support for integrating staking features into exchange-traded funds (ETFs). They argue that doing so would not only benefit investors but also more accurately reflect the advantages of native network assets . Furthermore, incorporating staking into ETFs could empower issuers to contribute to the security of the networks on which these assets operate. Ethereum Surpasses Bitcoin In ETF Inflows The proposed rule change comes at a crucial time for Grayscale, especially as its ETHE product has faced substantial outflows—nearly $4 billion—making it the largest loser among Ethereum investment products since the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. In contrast, the EZET has struggled to gain market traction , attracting only $650 million in inflows, which is minimal compared to its competitors. Other Ethereum spot ETFs, notably those managed by BlackRock and Fidelity, have seen significant inflows, largely due to their lower fees and strong institutional backing. The Ethereum ETF market’s dynamics are shifting, with Ethereum now gaining momentum in terms of ETF flows, even surpassing Bitcoin in inflows for the first week of February, as reported by CoinShares. If the NYSE Arca proposal is approved, it could significantly enhance the appeal of ETHE and EZET, providing a much-needed boost to their performance and potentially curbing outflows. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $2,645, recording a 20% loss in the monthly time frame for the market’s second largest cryptocurrency.

The emerging project 1Fuel has gained substantial market attention because of its potential for 100x returns after the crypto presale. Bonuses exceeding 40% remain available before February 23, making this opportunity an ideal chance to maximize substantial returns. Pepe price volatility pushes investors to consider new opportunities Because of its position as a meme coin, Pepe’s price faces huge wide swings, influenced by market sentiment and crypto whales. Investors who hold Pepe for the long term now doubt that the coin will sustain its upward trajectory during the next market boom. The price of Pepe, as depicted on CoinMarketCap, decreased by 39.94%, within the past month, leading traders to change their investment strategies. Industry experts predict that Pepe will encounter difficulties returning to previous price levels unless new significant utility systems and ecosystem innovations become available. Pepe holders are increasingly showing interest in 1Fuel due to its practical usage and successful crypto presale so far. The new project every PEPE investor should consider 1Fuel stands apart from meme coins because it creates a revolutionary crypto infrastructure that simplifies the process of cross-chain transactions. It provides users with a convenient platform to exchange digital assets among networks without needing multiple wallets. The 1Fuel platform prioritizes user privacy through built-in safety features, such as cold storage solutions, which combine with a transaction mixer to provide complete anonymity. PEPE, on the other hand, has not implemented these security measures. The best factor encouraging owners to explore 1Fuel is its exceptional crypto presale offers. This project’s public presale is in stage 4, with $2.3 million raised. Once $2.5 million is raised, it will provide a 20% bonus to all buyers who purchase before February 23. All purchasers will also receive a 40% bonus for all purchases until February 23 and 20% on all purchases to date for the presale target of $3 million. Why 1Fuel could be a 100x opportunity after launch The cryptocurrency field anticipates 1Fuel to turn into one of the top investments of 2024 after launch because analysts predict a 100x price increase following its release. The anticipated growth comes from innovative features like making transactions across networks easy and cost-effective with the help of AI. The platform provides three essential features: users can benefit from P2P transactions and 30% staking rewards with the planned development of virtual and physical crypto debit cards. Experts anticipate 1Fuel will experience extreme price growth after it lists on significant exchanges. Conclusion The market events impacting Pepe have led numerous investors toward choosing 1Fuel as their upcoming solution. The combination of revolutionary interchain operation features, robust security standards, and lucrative pre-sale events makes 1Fuel an exceptional entry point for diversifying crypto investments at a rapidly growing rate. Participating in the presale is likely a wise choice, as a 100x surge is possible. There is also excellent bonus potential: up to 40% on tokens bought before February 23 and 20% on all past tokens once the presale reaches $3 million.

40673543,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=680269,1740202521,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40673543.jpeg,Trump revives tariff probe over foreign digital taxes on US Tech,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-revives-tariff-probe-digital-taxes/,"President Trump ordered the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) to propose import tariffs on countries that levy digital taxes on US tech companies. According to a White House fact sheet, Trump wants the US Trade Representative office to reopen investigations initiated during his first term into countries that impose digital service taxes ( DSTs) to discriminate against US companies. With this move, he hopes to discourage foreign governments from taxing major US tech corporations like Alphabet and Meta. Trump even commented, “What they’re doing to us in other countries is terrible with digital.” Trump’s administration imposed tariffs on countries with DSTs in 2019, during his first term. When asked to give more details on Trump’s plans, a white house official stated that the president will not have other countries “appropriate America’s tax base” for their own gains. This is not Trump’s first time raising concerns about foreign government taxation policies. In 2019, the USTR investigated the tax systems of France, Italy, India, Spain, and other countries under Trump’s orders. It concluded then that their digital service taxes were discriminatory and harmed American tech firms. Thus, the office launched Section 301 unfair trade practices against these countries, necessitating tariffs on some imports. Since then, some countries opted to pull back their tax plans and even settled for international talks on reduced taxes on tech firms. However, there’s not really been much progress from their discussions. Currently, France, Turkey, Spain, Britain, Italy, India, Canada, and Austria have all imposed taxes on US tech sales revenues. Moreover, the Computer and Communications Industry Association estimates that roughly 30 countries have levied DSTs in the last few years, with Canada imposing them in 2024. Trump’s plans to counter DSTs could escalate tensions between the US and Europe France’s finance minister, Eric Lombard, has insisted that they will not withdraw their digital service taxes on US tech multinationals. In an interview with Bloomberg, he stated, “It’s not changing.” arguing that their tax policy is not a negotiating tool. He also argued that taxes are a question of sovereignty and that every nation has its policies, hoping that their stance would not result in a conflict with the US government. The European nation was actually one of the first to implement DSTs, and they had previously started negotiations with the US to reverse some of its tax plans. However, the two countries never completed their negotiations, and France’s taxes are still hitting hard American tech corporations. With the Trump administration considering retaliatory measures against France and other European nations, tensions could escalate—especially since most of Europe opposes Trump’s decision to negotiate a truce directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine war. Aside from the digital service tax issue, the Trump administration wants to check whether any European Union or UK practices incentivize US companies to develop products that undermine free speech. Trump and Vice President JD Vance have spoken over some of European regulations that they claim have stifled conservative voices.

By the time the market closed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had plunged 748.63 points (1.69%) to 43,428.02. The S&P 500 lost 1.71%, finishing at 6,013.13, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.2% to 19,524.01. Traders offloaded stocks as fears mounted about the weekend—another 48 hours where Trump could drop more tariff bombs after already threatening (repeatedly) to slap a 25% duty on cars, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals. Meanwhile, a closely watched measure of consumer confidence issued by the University of Michigan fell sharply in February from January. The survey also showed long-term inflation expectations reached the highest level since 1995. The housing market is breaking down. Sales of existing homes fell 4.9% in January, a far sharper decline than expected. Buyers are pulling back, squeezed by sky-high mortgage rates and rising home prices. That wasn’t the only red flag. The US services sector just shrank at its fastest rate in over two years, according to the latest S&P Global data. Business activity is slowing, and tariffs are making it worse. “The upbeat mood seen at the start of the year has evaporated,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global. “Uncertainty is rising, business activity is stalling, and inflation remains a serious issue.” Wall Street’s biggest names take a hit Big tech got crushed as investors bailed on high-growth names like Nvidia, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Palantir, and other investor favorites. According to data rom Google Finance, the risk-off sentiment sent cash pouring into defensive stocks, with Procter & Gamble rising 1.8% and General Mills and Kraft Heinz gaining over 3%. Walmart felt the pain too. The stock dropped 2.5%, its second straight day of declines, after the company warned that the consumer outlook is weakening. For the week, the S&P 500 slid 1.7%, while the Dow and Nasdaq both lost 2.5%. The sell-off was accompanied by a rally in Treasury notes, as investors sought the relative safety of government debt, and come at the end of a week of continued geopolitical uncertainty. The Federal Reserve is now in focus. Market bets on interest rate cuts changed fast, with traders now seeing a 55% chance that the Fed will cut rates two to three times by the end of 2025, bringing them down to 3.50%-3.75% from the current 4.25%-4.50%. On Thursday, those odds were just 44.4%. By October, futures suggest a 50-50 chance of a deeper cut between half and three-quarters of a percentage point—a massive change in expectations from just a day before, when the probability was only 38%. Options expiry adds to market chaos Friday was also a major options expiration day, which meant huge volumes and wild price swings. Nearly 80% of stocks in the S&P 500 finished lower, while small-cap stocks took an even bigger beating, with the Russell 2000 sinking more than 2%. “It’s pretty clear that markets are waking up to the consumer impact of tariffs,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group. “Even if these tariffs never take effect, consumers are already changing their behavior.” Wall Street is starting to price in the full effects of Trump’s trade war. Investors had initially brushed off the White House’s tariff threats, assuming they were just negotiating tactics. But now, it’s looking real. The administration has already promised tariffs on Canada and Mexico, two of America’s largest trading partners. Manufacturers are feeling the heat as well—rising input costs and wage pressures are making it more expensive to operate. “That buy-the-dip mentality, it’s never been higher at the retail level … it’s just the widespread exuberance in the market,” Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, told CNBC. “It’s kind of a Pavlovian response. They’ve bought the dip for two, three years plus and it’s paid off, so they feel very confident about their stock-picking ability and trading this bull market,” Turnquist added.

CryptoQuant CEO Says Altseason Already Begun,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/altcoins-ready-for-round-two-cryptoquant-ceo-says-altseason-already-begun/,"As the cycle progresses, many investors are awaiting the long-anticipated Altseason, with opinions split on whether it will happen. Several market watchers have affirmed that Altcoins (Alts) are getting ready for an explosive breakout, but others, including CryptoQuant’s CEO, have suggested a different outlook. Related Reading: Nansen’s Bitcoin On-Chain Analytics Reveal 42% Increase In BTC Transactions Few Cryptocurrencies To ‘Survive’ The Altseason On Friday, Ki Young Ju, CryptoQuant’s founder and CEO, affirmed that the Altseason has begun. In an X thread, Ju suggested that there will not be a direct Bitcoin-to-alt rotation this cycle, noting that “stablecoin holders are favoring” Altcoins. According to Ju, Bitcoin is no longer a quote cryptocurrency, adding that Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance doesn’t define the altseason anymore. In a December post, he explained that “Altcoins used to move together based on their correlation with BTC,” however, this pattern has now broken. Instead, he stated that trading volume is the metric that defines it, with Altcoins currently having 2.7x the volume of Bitcoin. Ju also considers this to be a very selective and challenging altseason, with only a few Altcoins with strong user cases and narratives expected to thrive. He added that, despite good market sentiment, there isn’t fresh liquidity, which “feels like a PvP fight over a fixed pie.” As a result, Altcoin battles “are getting fiercer,” and only a few are pumping this altseason and attracting new liquidity. Altcoin markets are currently a zero-sum PvP game. While Bitcoin has doubled its market cap, the alt market cap is still below its previous ATH, rotating among themselves without fresh capital inflows. Only a few Alts with strong use cases and narratives will survive. Altcoins Ready For Next Leg Up Trader Crypto Yoddha suggested that Altcoins are “ready for round 2” after its recent performance. According to the post, the crypto market, excluding BTC and ETH, is following 2020-2021’s playbook. During the last cycle, Altcoins experienced two legs towards its cycle top and all-time high (ATH) of $1.13 trillion. In the “first round,” they broke out from its accumulation period, seeing a small re-accumulation phase before surging to the previous top. After reclaiming this resistance level, Altcoins started “round two,” achieving various new highs before hitting a new cycle top. Yoddha pointed out that the market is finishing the first round, as it tested last cycle’s top during the post-election pump. Analyst Rekt Capital affirmed that the crypto market cap, excluding the top 10 tokens, “has completed the second part of its Double Bottom formation.” He explained that Altcoins had been consolidating between the $250 billion to $280 billion range since the February 3 correction.

Analyst Says Longer ETH Consolidation Is Needed Per the post, Alts must close above $280 billion and retest this level as support to confirm a breakout from its three-week resistance and attempt to reclaim the $300 billion mark. Similarly, analyst Carl Runefelt stated that Altcoins have a parabolic move after breaking out of its two-month descending channel. Alts saw a 120% climb after breaking out of a 2024 multi-month descending channel. Altcoins must reclaim the $300 billion resistance to break from this pattern.

As questions arose about who was behind the attack, renowned blockchain investigator ZachXBT stepped forward with concrete evidence, linking the hack to the infamous North Korean state-sponsored cybercriminal group, Lazarus. Lazarus Group Behind Bybit Hack Blockchain data platform Arkham Intelligence recently offered a bounty of 50K ARKM (about $30K) to help & identify who was behind the massive $1 billion Bybit hack. However, well-known blockchain investigator ZachXBT took on the challenge and uncovered the truth. Using his deep on-chain analysis skills, he provided solid proof that the Lazarus Group carried out the attack. His investigation revealed test transactions, wallet links before the hack, forensic charts, and timing breakdowns, all pointing directly to the group. ZachXBT’s findings showed that Lazarus first made small test transactions before launching the full attack. Hackers use this common technique to ensure their methods will work before moving large sums. Later by carefully tracking wallet movements and transaction timestamps, he was able to trace the stolen funds back to addresses controlled by the Lazarus group. Waiting For Bybit’s Response Arkham Intelligence confirmed that ZachXBT has shared his findings with Bybit’s team to assist in their investigation. While Bybit has yet to release a detailed statement, this new evidence could help them take action to recover lost funds or strengthen their security measures. History Of Notorious Act By Lazarus Group Lazarus is known for targeting crypto firms and has been behind several major crypto thefts, making it a main suspect from the start. However, it’s not just one team but several groups with different skills behind this group. Some focus on phishing scams, others carry out complex blockchain attacks, and some use fake identities to trick crypto companies. Last year alone, the group managed to steal over $1.3 billion from different projects, making up 61% of all stolen crypto in 2024.",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|ARKM|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 06:29:24

Offering AI-powered trading, seamless multi-chain swaps, and P2P exchange tools, 1Fuel is revolutionizing decentralized trading. With over $2.3 million raised in its ongoing ICO, experts predict a 100x surge, making it a top contender for massive 2025 gains. RUNE gains momentum as major upgrade nears The RUNE price is showing strong momentum ahead of its highly anticipated V3.20 upgrade. Currently, the RUNE price stands at $1.18, with a market cap of $428.32 million. Trading activity has surged, with daily volume increasing by 36.3% to $209.43 million. The upcoming update will remove the controversial mimir key, a move designed to enhance decentralized governance. The THORChain community has widely supported this decision, which could increase demand for RUNE. Analysts suggest that if RUNE price breaks above $1.39, it could rally to $1.70, while a failure to do so may push it down toward $1.11. With governance improvements and rising investor interest, THORChain’s latest upgrade could set the stage for a major rally. Investors are closely monitoring the RUNE price movements, anticipating potential breakout opportunities as momentum builds ahead of this key development. Kusama (KSM) eyes potential surge with upcoming DOT 2.0 upgrade Kusama remains an essential element of the Polkadot ecosystem, although well below its all-time high of $621.71 in May 2021. With DOT 2.0 due for release in March, market experts think Kusama could reach $50 with Polkadot’s expanded interoperability and governance enhancements. Historically, Kusama has acted as Polkadot’s experimental network, meaning any major Polkadot upgrade tends to impact KSM’s value directly. Currently trading near multi-month highs at $19, Kusama still holds long-term potential. As speculation around DOT 2.0 intensifies, KSM could see renewed bullish momentum, making it a token to watch as March approaches. With Kusama’s historical volatility, its next breakout could be closer than expected. 1Fuel (OFT): The future of seamless trading and real-world crypto payments 1Fuel (OFT) is redefining crypto transactions by introducing fast, cross-chain compatibility and a universal wallet that interacts effortlessly with decentralized applications across multiple networks. Unlike outdated exchanges, 1Fuel leverages AI-powered analytics to assess market conditions, fine-tune trading strategies, and enhance investment outcomes dynamically. The platform’s peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange removes third parties and also offers immediate asset transfers, lower transaction costs and greater productivity. Security remains a top priority, with cold storage technology keeping inactive assets offline and avoiding possible breaches. A built-in privacy mixer further enhances anonymity, ensuring traders’ activity remains confidential. One of 1Fuel’s most innovative features is its crypto debit card, designed to bridge the gap between digital assets and everyday transactions. Users can instantly convert crypto to fiat and spend it at merchants accepting Visa and Mastercard, removing the need for manual swaps or exchange delays. To fuel presale excitement, 1Fuel has rolled out an exclusive reward program. Suppose the community surpasses $3 million in sales before February 23. In that case, early investors receive a 20% bonus on previous purchases, while new buyers between February 17 and the deadline will enjoy a 40% bonus on fresh investments. Contributors investing $2,000 or more will also gain priority beta access to the upcoming 1Fuel wallet. With $2.3 million already secured in its ongoing Stage 4 presale at $0.018, 1Fuel is witnessing a surge in demand. As the deadline approaches, investors are racing to claim their share before prices climb higher.

40675014,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=132996,1740205905,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Hopeful Comeback: 79% of FTX Creditors Plan Bold Crypto Reinvestment, Eyeing Solana & Memecoins",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ftx-creditors-crypto-reinvestment/,"In a surprising turn of events, even amidst the fallout from the FTX collapse, a beacon of optimism shines through the crypto community. A recent survey has unveiled a fascinating trend: a significant majority of FTX creditors are not deterred but are in fact gearing up to double down on the digital asset space. This news sparks a wave of hopeful anticipation for the future of the crypto market. Let’s dive into the details of this intriguing survey and explore what it means for the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies. Why FTX Creditors Crypto Reinvestment Signals Market Resilience Despite the financial setbacks experienced by FTX users, their unwavering belief in the potential of cryptocurrencies is truly remarkable. The survey, conducted by NFTevening, polled 1,016 FTX creditors and revealed that a staggering 79% of them are planning to reinvest their recovered funds back into the crypto ecosystem. This isn’t just a small fraction; it represents a strong majority signaling robust confidence in the long-term prospects of digital assets. This planned FTX creditors crypto reinvestment demonstrates a powerful resilience within the crypto community. Instead of being discouraged by past events, these investors are seeing the FTX situation as a chapter, not the end of the story. This collective decision to reinvest is fueled by several factors: Long-term Belief: Many creditors view the FTX incident as an isolated case of mismanagement rather than a fundamental flaw in cryptocurrency technology or its potential. Opportunity in the Dip: The market correction following events like the FTX collapse can be seen as a buying opportunity. Savvy investors often look to accumulate assets when prices are lower, anticipating future growth. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Innovation: The core principles of DeFi, offering transparency and control, remain attractive. The continuous innovation within the crypto space, with new projects and technologies emerging, keeps the sector vibrant and promising. This hopeful outlook from FTX creditors provides a strong counter-narrative to the negative sentiment that often follows market downturns. It highlights the enduring appeal and perceived potential of cryptocurrencies as a viable asset class. Solana Investment: The Preferred Choice for Reinvestment Delving deeper into the survey, it’s clear where a significant portion of this reinvestment is headed. Among the 79% planning to reinvest, a notable 62% have their sights set on acquiring Solana (SOL). This makes Solana investment the clear frontrunner for these returning crypto enthusiasts. But why Solana? Solana has consistently been recognized for its high transaction speeds and lower fees compared to some other major blockchains. Despite facing its own challenges, including network outages and price volatility, Solana’s technology and vibrant ecosystem continue to attract developers and investors. Here are some compelling reasons why FTX creditors are leaning towards Solana: Technological Advantages: Solana’s architecture is designed for scalability, making it suitable for high-volume applications and transactions, which is crucial for the future of decentralized applications (dApps). Growing Ecosystem: The Solana ecosystem boasts a wide array of projects, including DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and gaming applications. This diverse ecosystem offers numerous opportunities for investors. Community Support: Despite challenges, Solana has a strong and active community that remains committed to its growth and development. Potential for Growth: Many investors believe Solana is undervalued and has significant potential for future price appreciation, especially as the broader crypto market matures. Furthermore, the survey revealed that 44% of these creditors are specifically looking to invest in Solana-based projects. This indicates a strong belief not just in the Solana token itself, but in the entire ecosystem built upon it. This targeted Solana investment suggests a strategic approach, focusing on platforms and applications leveraging Solana’s capabilities. The Allure of Memecoin Surge: A Risky Yet Tempting Bet While Solana takes the lead in planned reinvestments, another intriguing trend emerges from the survey: one-third of FTX creditors are considering investing their repayments in memecoins. The world of memecoins is known for its volatility and high-risk, high-reward nature. Investing in memecoins is akin to riding a rollercoaster – it can be thrilling, but also comes with significant risks. The potential for a sudden memecoin surge and exponential gains is undeniably attractive, especially for those looking to recoup losses or make quick profits. Why are memecoins drawing attention from FTX creditors? High Potential Returns: Memecoins, driven by community hype and social media trends, can experience massive price surges in short periods. This potential for quick, substantial returns is a major draw. Lower Entry Barrier: Often, memecoins are priced very low, allowing investors to acquire large quantities with relatively small investments. This accessibility makes them appealing to a broader range of investors. Community Driven: The value of memecoins is heavily influenced by community sentiment and online trends. A strong and active community can drive significant price appreciation. Speculative Opportunity: For some, memecoins represent a purely speculative play – a gamble with the potential for outsized gains. This speculative aspect can be particularly enticing in a recovering market. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent risks associated with memecoin investments. Their volatility is extreme, and prices can plummet just as quickly as they rise. Investors must approach memecoins with caution, understanding that they are highly speculative assets and should only allocate funds they can afford to lose. Navigating the Crypto Market Recovery: A Strategic Digital Asset Strategy The planned reinvestment by FTX creditors is occurring within a broader context of crypto market recovery . After periods of market downturn and uncertainty, there are increasing signs of stabilization and renewed growth in the crypto space. This recovery is characterized by: Institutional Interest: Continued and growing interest from institutional investors is injecting significant capital into the market and lending credibility to cryptocurrencies as an asset class. Technological Advancements: Ongoing developments in blockchain technology, including scalability solutions and interoperability, are enhancing the functionality and usability of cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Clarity (in some regions): Increased regulatory clarity in certain jurisdictions is providing a more stable and predictable environment for crypto businesses and investors. Mainstream Adoption: We are seeing increasing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, with more businesses accepting crypto payments and individuals integrating digital assets into their financial portfolios. For FTX creditors and new investors alike, navigating this recovering market requires a strategic digital asset strategy . Here are some actionable insights to consider: Strategy Description Benefits Risks Diversification Spread investments across different cryptocurrencies (e.g., Solana, established coins, and a small allocation to memecoins) and asset classes. Reduces overall portfolio risk, captures growth potential across sectors. May dilute potential gains if one asset class significantly outperforms others. Due Diligence Thoroughly research any cryptocurrency or project before investing. Understand the technology, team, use case, and market sentiment. Informed investment decisions, reduces the risk of investing in scams or poorly conceived projects. Time-consuming, requires continuous learning and adaptation to the rapidly evolving crypto space. Risk Management Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders and take profits strategically. Protects capital, manages emotional trading decisions. May miss out on potential further gains if stop-loss orders are triggered prematurely. Long-Term Perspective Focus on the long-term potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies rather than short-term market fluctuations. Reduces stress from market volatility, potentially captures significant long-term growth. Capital may be tied up for extended periods, market conditions can change significantly over time. Conclusion: A Testament to Crypto’s Enduring Appeal The survey results are clear: the spirit of crypto remains resilient. The fact that a significant majority of FTX creditors are planning to reinvest their repayments into the crypto market, with a keen interest in Solana and even memecoins, speaks volumes about the enduring appeal and perceived future of digital assets. This is not just about recovering losses; it’s a powerful statement of belief in the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. As the market continues to evolve and mature, the hopeful reinvestment of these creditors could very well contribute to the next wave of crypto growth and innovation, proving that even setbacks can pave the way for remarkable comebacks.

This news, initially reported by Tree News citing Bloomberg, signals a potential turning point for the platform and offers a glimpse into the evolving regulatory landscape for digital assets. Are you wondering what this means for OpenSea and the broader NFT ecosystem? Let’s dive into the details of this crucial update. What Triggered the OpenSea SEC Probe? The shadow of regulatory scrutiny loomed over OpenSea when it received a ‘Wells notice’ from the SEC back in August. But what exactly is a Wells notice, and why did OpenSea receive one? A Wells notice is essentially a formal notification from the SEC to a company or individual, informing them that the agency is considering recommending enforcement action against them. It provides the recipient an opportunity to present their case as to why such action should not be taken. In OpenSea’s case, the specifics of the SEC investigation were not publicly disclosed, but it’s widely speculated that the probe revolved around whether certain NFTs listed on the platform could be classified as securities. This concern stems from the ongoing debate within the crypto industry about the classification of digital assets. The SEC has been actively examining various crypto projects and platforms to determine if they fall under securities laws. If an NFT is deemed a security, it would subject the platforms trading them to stricter regulations, including registration requirements and compliance with securities laws. This is a critical issue for the burgeoning NFT marketplace sector. The Relief: SEC Investigation Concludes The recent announcement that the OpenSea SEC probe is concluding brings a wave of relief to the platform and the wider NFT community. While the exact details of the conclusion are still awaited, the fact that the SEC is reportedly wrapping up its investigation without any publicly announced enforcement action is a positive sign. This suggests that either OpenSea successfully addressed the SEC’s concerns or the SEC decided not to pursue further action in this instance. This development is significant for several reasons: Reduced Regulatory Uncertainty: The conclusion of the probe removes a major cloud of uncertainty hanging over OpenSea. Regulatory ambiguity can stifle innovation and investment, and clarity in this area is crucial for the continued growth of the NFT space. Positive Signal for NFT Market: The news can be interpreted as a positive signal for the broader NFT marketplace . It might suggest a more nuanced approach from the SEC towards NFTs, at least in this particular case. This could boost confidence among creators, collectors, and investors in the NFT market. OpenSea Can Focus on Growth: With the SEC investigation seemingly behind them, OpenSea can now fully focus on its core business – enhancing its platform, expanding its offerings, and driving further adoption of NFTs. This could lead to new features, partnerships, and initiatives from the leading marketplace. What Does This Mean for Crypto Regulation and the Future of NFTs? While the conclusion of the OpenSea SEC probe is encouraging, it’s important to remember that the regulatory landscape for crypto, including NFTs, is still evolving. This instance could provide some valuable insights into how the SEC is approaching NFTs, but it doesn’t necessarily set a precedent for all NFT platforms or projects. Here are some key takeaways and considerations: Aspect Implications Ongoing Crypto Regulation The need for clear and consistent crypto regulation remains paramount. The OpenSea case highlights the complexities and uncertainties surrounding the classification of digital assets. NFT Scrutiny While this probe concluded, it’s likely that NFTs will continue to be under regulatory scrutiny, particularly as the market matures and becomes more mainstream. Platform Compliance NFT marketplaces must prioritize compliance and engage proactively with regulators to navigate the evolving legal framework. Industry Dialogue Continued dialogue between the crypto industry and regulatory bodies is crucial to foster innovation while ensuring investor protection and market integrity. Navigating the Regulatory Maze: Actionable Insights for NFT Enthusiasts So, what can you, as an NFT enthusiast, creator, or collector, take away from this situation? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments in the crypto and NFT space. Follow industry news, legal updates, and announcements from regulatory bodies like the SEC. Understand Risk: Recognize that the regulatory environment for NFTs is still developing, and there are inherent risks associated with digital assets. Do your own research and understand the projects you are involved in. Support Responsible Platforms: Favor NFT marketplaces that demonstrate a commitment to compliance and transparency. Platforms that engage proactively with regulators are more likely to navigate the regulatory landscape successfully. Engage in the Conversation: Participate in discussions about crypto regulation and the future of NFTs. Your voice and perspective are valuable in shaping the regulatory landscape. A Breath of Fresh Air for OpenSea and the NFT World The conclusion of the OpenSea SEC probe is undoubtedly a positive development. It provides a sense of closure for OpenSea and injects renewed optimism into the NFT marketplace . While the broader regulatory questions surrounding digital assets persist, this instance offers a glimmer of hope and suggests a path forward for the responsible growth of the NFT ecosystem. The industry will be keenly watching for further details and any official statements from both OpenSea and the SEC to fully understand the implications of this conclusion. For now, it appears to be a moment of victory for OpenSea and a sign of resilience for the ever-evolving world of NFTs.

The digital world is buzzing with a potential game-changer. A colossal hack at crypto exchange Bybit, reportedly siphoning off a staggering $1.4 billion in Ethereum (ETH), has ignited a fiery debate within the crypto community – could this lead to an Ethereum Fork ? What Shocked the Crypto World? The Massive Bybit Hack Conor Grogan, a key figure at Coinbase as Director of Product Strategy and Business Operations, dropped a bombshell on X (formerly Twitter). He declared the Bybit breach as potentially the “largest theft in history.” This isn’t just pocket change; we’re talking about a sum that could send ripples across the entire crypto ecosystem. According to Wu Blockchain, Grogan hinted that this monumental crypto theft could spark serious discussions about an unprecedented move – an Ethereum Fork to recover the stolen funds. Why is Everyone Talking About an Ethereum Fork? For those unfamiliar, an Ethereum Fork , particularly a rollback, is a drastic measure. Imagine rewinding a blockchain to a previous state, effectively undoing transactions. It’s like hitting the ‘undo’ button on the entire history of transactions after a specific point. This concept, while technically feasible, is fraught with controversy and raises fundamental questions about blockchain immutability and decentralization. Here’s a breakdown of why an Ethereum Fork in this situation is such a hot topic: Scale of the Theft: $1.4 billion is an unprecedented amount. Recovering such a sum would be a massive win for Bybit and potentially set a precedent for future large-scale hacks. Community Sentiment: The crypto community is deeply divided on the issue of blockchain immutability. Some believe in the ‘code is law’ principle, arguing against any form of rollback, while others prioritize protecting users and recovering stolen funds, especially in cases of blatant theft. Precedent Setting: Forking to reverse transactions, even in extreme cases like this, could open a Pandora’s Box. It could raise concerns about the security and finality of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain in the long run. Arthur Hayes Jumps into the Ethereum Fork Debate: Support for Rollback? Adding fuel to the fire, none other than Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX and CIO of Web3 venture firm Maelstrom, weighed in on the matter. In his own X post, Hayes stated that if the Ethereum community decides to perform a blockchain rollback to retrieve Bybit’s pilfered assets, he would throw his weight behind the move. Hayes’ support, a prominent voice in the crypto space, further amplifies the gravity of this potential ETH recovery scenario. The Burning Question: To Fork or Not to Fork? The core dilemma revolves around the very essence of blockchain technology. Blockchains are designed to be immutable, meaning once a transaction is recorded, it’s permanent and irreversible. However, extreme situations like this Bybit crypto theft force us to confront the limitations and potential trade-offs of this immutability. Let’s consider the arguments: Arguments FOR an Ethereum Fork (Rollback) Arguments AGAINST an Ethereum Fork (No Rollback) Recovery of Stolen Funds: A fork could potentially return the $1.4 billion ETH to Bybit, mitigating significant financial damage. Deterrent to Future Hacks: It might send a message to hackers that even seemingly successful heists can be reversed. Community Protection: Prioritizes the protection of a major crypto exchange and potentially its users from a devastating loss. Violation of Immutability: Undermines the fundamental principle of blockchain permanence, potentially eroding trust in Ethereum. Centralization Concerns: Decision-making power for such a significant event raises questions about decentralization within the Ethereum community. Precedent Risk: Could encourage future fork requests for various reasons, weakening the integrity of the blockchain. Technical Complexity and Risks: Executing a fork is technically complex and carries risks of unforeseen consequences and network instability. Navigating the Uncharted Waters of ETH Recovery The situation is undeniably complex. While the prospect of recovering $1.4 billion in ETH recovery is undeniably attractive, the potential ramifications of an Ethereum Fork are equally significant. The Ethereum community now faces a monumental decision – one that will not only impact Bybit but could also reshape perceptions of blockchain security and governance for years to come. This isn’t just about Bybit; it’s about the future trajectory of Ethereum and the broader crypto space. Will the allure of recovering a massive crypto theft outweigh the principles of blockchain immutability? The coming days and weeks will be critical in understanding how this unprecedented situation unfolds and the path the Ethereum community chooses to take. Stay Tuned for Updates on the Ethereum Fork Debate The debate surrounding a potential Ethereum Fork is just beginning.

In a post on X, Martinez highlighted that the TD Sequential indicator has signaled a buy opportunity on XRP’s hourly chart. The signal comes after a period of sideways movement, suggesting a potential shift in momentum. The attached chart illustrates a series of bearish candlesticks leading into what appears to be a stabilization phase. Notably, Martinez predicted this decline in mid-February. Following this, the asset saw multiple days of bearish closes, before a brief consolidation phase. $XRP looks set for a rebound as the TD Sequential indicator flashes a buy signal on the hourly chart! pic.twitter.com/PYN6TuyI8W — Ali (@ali_charts) February 21, 2025 The TD Sequential Indicator Turns Positive The chart presents a compelling buy signal due to the TD Sequential indicator’s structure, which is designed to identify trend exhaustion and potential reversals. In this case, the appearance of a green “1” after a completed bearish sequence suggests that selling pressure may weaken and buyers could begin regaining control. The consolidation phase, which often precedes a reversal, has added to the bullish sentiment. The slight upward movement following the signal further supports the idea that buying interest is increasing, making this a key technical point for traders watching for a shift in momentum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 At the time of Martinez’s post, XRP was trading around $2.6557, reflecting a slight increase of 0.30%. The indicator suggests buyers may begin entering the market, potentially reversing the previous downtrend. However, as with any technical signal, confirmation through additional indicators and price action is necessary before establishing a definitive trend direction. Where is XRP Going Next? Martinez has previously provided insights into XRP’s price movements, identifying both bullish and bearish patterns. Recently, he noted that XRP could be gearing up for a rebound following a bullish signal similar to the current one. XRP’s broader trend remains influenced by factors beyond technical indicators. Market sentiment, overall cryptocurrency trends, and external developments such as regulatory updates continue to play a role in price fluctuations. Martinez pointed out that if XRP maintains certain support levels, it could retest higher price points , including the $3 range. While Martinez’s analysis suggests a possible shift in momentum, broader market conditions will ultimately determine whether XRP can sustain an upward move. However, the market is leaning toward a bullish run in the short term, and XRP could begin smashing records soon.

40675254,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=132999,1740206384,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Neutral Alert: Crypto Fear & Greed Index Signals Market Indecision at 49,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-neutral-8/,"Just when the crypto market started showing signs of heating up, a shift in sentiment has put things in perspective. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a widely tracked market sentiment indicator, has taken a breather, moving from the ‘Greed’ zone back into ‘Neutral’ territory. As of February 22nd, the index stands at 49, a six-point drop from the previous day. What does this cooling off mean for your crypto portfolio and the overall market? Let’s dive deep into this intriguing shift. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What’s Behind the Numbers? For those new to the crypto space, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index might sound like something straight out of a sci-fi movie. But in reality, it’s a powerful tool developed by Alternative.me to gauge the overall mood of the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a sentiment thermometer for crypto. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are overly worried, often a sign of potential buying opportunities. 25-49: Fear – Anxious market conditions, suggesting caution but also possible entry points. 50-75: Greed – Growing optimism, hinting at potential market tops and need for careful consideration. 76-100: Extreme Greed – Overheated market, often signaling an impending correction. 49-51: Neutral – Balanced sentiment, market indecision, could go either way. Currently sitting at 49, the index is firmly in the ‘Neutral’ zone. This suggests that the dominant emotions driving the crypto market are neither extreme fear nor excessive greed. It’s a state of equilibrium, a pause for breath, and a moment for investors to reassess and strategize. What Factors Influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The crypto analysis tool isn’t based on guesswork. It’s a calculated metric that considers a range of market dynamics. Six key factors are meticulously weighed to arrive at the daily index value: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and max drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the 30-day and 90-day averages. Unusually high volatility can signal fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares current market momentum and trading volume to recent averages (30 and 90 days). High buying volumes indicate greed, while low volumes can point to fear. Social Media (15%): Primarily analyzes sentiment on Twitter, particularly crypto-related hashtags and engagement levels. A surge in positive interactions can reflect greed, and vice versa. Surveys (15%): Weekly polls conducted on platforms like StrawPoll, asking crypto investors about their market sentiment. These provide direct insights into investor feelings. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin’s dominance compared to the rest of the crypto market. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes stem from fear as investors flock to the perceived safety of Bitcoin during market uncertainty. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries. Spikes in searches like “Bitcoin price prediction” or “Bitcoin crash” can indicate fear, while general interest in buying Bitcoin can signal greed. The recent shift to ‘Neutral’ indicates a combined effect of changes across these factors. Perhaps volatility has subsided slightly, or social media sentiment has become less overwhelmingly positive. It’s a nuanced picture, and understanding these components helps in interpreting the index effectively. Neutral is the New Normal? Navigating Market Indecision The market sentiment moving into ‘Neutral’ doesn’t necessarily mean the crypto party is over, nor does it signal an impending crash. Instead, it suggests a period of market indecision. Investors are taking a pause, evaluating the current landscape, and waiting for clearer signals before making decisive moves. This phase can be characterized by: Sideways Price Action: Expect to see less dramatic price swings and more consolidation as the market searches for direction. Reduced Trading Volume: With less conviction in either direction, trading volumes might decrease as investors hold back. Increased Scrutiny: Investors become more selective and analytical, focusing on project fundamentals and long-term potential rather than just hype. Potential Accumulation Phase: For astute investors, ‘Neutral’ can be an opportune time to accumulate positions in fundamentally strong cryptocurrencies at potentially favorable prices. However, ‘Neutral’ can also be a calm before the storm. It’s crucial to monitor other market indicators and news developments to anticipate the next market move. Will the market tip back into ‘Greed’ or slide further into ‘Fear’? The answer likely lies in upcoming macroeconomic events, regulatory news, and technological advancements in the crypto space. Bitcoin’s Role in the Neutral Zone: What to Watch For Bitcoin , as the flagship cryptocurrency, plays a pivotal role in influencing the overall market sentiment and, consequently, the Fear & Greed Index. When the index is neutral, Bitcoin’s price action becomes even more critical. Here’s what to keep an eye on: Bitcoin Price Levels: Monitor key support and resistance levels for Bitcoin. A break above resistance could signal a return to ‘Greed,’ while falling below support might push the index towards ‘Fear.’ Bitcoin Dominance Shifts: Watch for significant changes in Bitcoin dominance. A sharp increase could suggest a flight to safety amid broader market concerns, while a decrease might indicate renewed risk appetite in altcoins. Bitcoin On-Chain Metrics: Analyze on-chain data such as transaction volumes, active addresses, and miner activity. These metrics can provide insights into the underlying strength and health of the Bitcoin network and its potential price trajectory. Institutional Interest in Bitcoin: Track news and developments related to institutional adoption of Bitcoin. Continued institutional interest can be a strong bullish signal, even in a neutral market. For instance, if we see institutional buying increasing during this ‘Neutral’ phase, it could be a strong indication that smart money is accumulating before the next bull run. Conversely, negative regulatory news or macroeconomic headwinds could quickly shift sentiment towards ‘Fear’. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Neutral Crypto Market So, what should you do when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index flashes ‘Neutral’? Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Now is the perfect time to double down on research. Identify fundamentally strong projects, understand their use cases, and assess their long-term potential. Portfolio Rebalancing: Consider rebalancing your portfolio. Take profits from overextended positions and strategically allocate capital to undervalued assets. Risk Management: Neutral markets can be unpredictable. Ensure your risk management strategies are in place. Use stop-loss orders and avoid over-leveraging. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory updates, and technological advancements. Information is your best tool in navigating uncertain times. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you believe in the long-term potential of crypto, ‘Neutral’ periods can be excellent for implementing a DCA strategy, gradually building your positions over time. In essence, a ‘Neutral’ reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a call for prudence, analysis, and strategic positioning. It’s a time to be neither overly bullish nor bearish, but rather, intelligently prepared for whatever the market throws next. Conclusion: Embracing Market Equilibrium The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s dip into ‘Neutral’ territory serves as a valuable reminder of the cyclical nature of market sentiment. It’s a signal to pause, reflect, and strategize. While extreme fear or greed can sometimes present clear buy or sell signals, ‘Neutral’ demands a more nuanced approach. By understanding the factors that drive the index and closely monitoring market dynamics, investors can navigate this phase of market indecision with confidence and prepare for future opportunities. The crypto market is ever-evolving, and staying informed and adaptable is the key to long-term success.

Blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence confirmed the group’s involvement, citing evidence from onchain sleuth ZachXBT. The attackers executed the breach using a method known as “ Blind Signing ,” which allows transactions to be approved without full visibility into their contents. Bybit’s ETH cold wallet was compromised, leading to the transfer of nearly $1.5 billion worth of assets into a single wallet before being dispersed across multiple wallets. The Hunt for the Hackers Before Arkham confirmed Lazarus’ involvement, the firm offered a 50,000 ARKM bounty for anyone tracking the perpetrators. ZachXBT provided a detailed analysis, tracing the stolen funds through test transactions and forensic data. His findings left no doubt that the attack was the work of Lazarus. Blockchain security firm Blockaid’s CEO Ido Ben Natan explained that Blind Signing attacks have become a go-to strategy for sophisticated hackers, including North Korea. Similar methods, like the Radiant Capital and WazirX incidents, were used in previous breaches. Funds on the Move Blockchain data firm Nansen revealed that the stolen funds were initially placed in a primary wallet before being divided among over 40 different wallets. The attackers then converted all stETH, cmETH, and mETH holdings to ETH, systematically transferring chunks of $27 million to more than 10 additional wallets. This method made tracking and recovering the funds significantly harder. North Korea’s Cyberwarfare & Financial Motivations 10x Research highlights that Lazarus’s cyberattacks are not merely criminal activities but a state-sponsored initiative to fund North Korea’s military projects. The U.S. government estimates that crypto-related cybercrimes finance up to 30% of North Korea’s missile programs. Hackers are selected from a young age and trained extensively, with top talents sent to China for advanced cyber education. The Lazarus Group’s exploits include infamous breaches like the Ronin Network ($625m), KuCoin ($285m), and Binance Bridge ($570m). Their techniques remain undetected, adapting to the latest security protocols while using social engineering and malware to penetrate even the most secure platforms. Moreover, they rely on DeFi platforms like Uniswap to launder money since these platforms don’t require KYC checks. Interestingly if North Korea is behind all this then they will become the 14th largest holder of Ether, beating the holdings of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin as per data . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network Clears the Air After Bybit CEO Calls It a Scam, Pi Coin Rises by 20% , Bybit Responds Bybit CEO Ben Zhou confirmed that despite the loss, the exchange remains financially stable.

With North Korea’s Lazarus Group repeatedly pulling off high-profile crypto heists, the industry faces increasing pressure to bolster security against such sophisticated threats. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

40675310,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133007,1740206481,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unraveling the Crypto Laundering Secrets of Lazarus Group: Years to Cash Out Stolen Funds,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/lazarus-group-crypto-laundering-secrets/,"Ever wondered what happens to millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency stolen by notorious hacker groups? It’s not as simple as just cashing it out and buying a fleet of Lamborghinis! Crypto expert Eric Wall recently shed light on the intricate and surprisingly lengthy process employed by North Korea’s Lazarus Group to launder their ill-gotten digital gains. Let’s dive into the fascinating, and frankly alarming, world of crypto laundering and how these cybercriminals operate. Decoding Lazarus Group’s Crypto Laundering Strategy According to crypto investor Eric Wall, the Lazarus Group, a hacking entity linked to North Korea, isn’t just grabbing crypto and running. They have a well-defined, multi-stage process to convert their stolen crypto into usable fiat currency. It’s like a digital obstacle course designed to obscure the origin of the funds. Here’s a breakdown of their laundering playbook: Step 1: ERC-20 Token Swap for Ether (ETH): Initially, many of the cryptocurrencies stolen are in the form of ERC-20 tokens, which operate on the Ethereum blockchain. The first step involves swapping these diverse tokens for Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum. This consolidation simplifies the holdings into a more liquid and widely accepted cryptocurrency. Step 2: Ether (ETH) to Bitcoin (BTC) Conversion: Next, the laundered Ether is converted into Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin, being the oldest and most dominant cryptocurrency, offers broader accessibility and liquidity across various exchanges globally. This step is crucial for further obfuscation and easier movement of funds. Step 3: Bitcoin (BTC) Cash Out via Asian Exchanges to Chinese Yuan: The final and perhaps most challenging step is cashing out the Bitcoin into traditional fiat currency, specifically Chinese Yuan. This is reportedly done through Asian cryptocurrency exchanges. This stage aims to convert the digital assets into a usable currency that can be accessed and utilized, presumably by the North Korean regime. Wall’s insights, shared on X (formerly Twitter), highlight the patience and persistence of the Lazarus Group . This isn’t a quick smash-and-grab operation; it’s a calculated, long-term strategy to extract value from their cyber heists. Why Does Crypto Laundering Take So Long? You might be thinking, “Years to cash out? In the fast-paced world of crypto?” Yes, years! And there are several reasons why crypto laundering , especially at this scale, is a marathon, not a sprint: Blockchain Transparency: While cryptocurrencies offer pseudonymity, blockchain transactions are transparent and traceable. Every transaction is recorded on a public ledger, making it possible for blockchain analysis firms and law enforcement agencies to track the flow of funds. Laundering efforts are all about trying to break or obscure this chain of traceability, which takes time and complex maneuvers. Exchange Scrutiny and KYC/AML Regulations: Cryptocurrency exchanges are increasingly under regulatory pressure to implement Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures. Large or suspicious transactions can trigger red flags, leading to account freezes and investigations. Launderers need to navigate these regulations carefully, often using multiple exchanges and smaller transactions to avoid detection, slowing down the process significantly. Liquidity Constraints: Cashing out massive amounts of cryptocurrency, especially into fiat currency like Chinese Yuan, can be challenging without attracting attention. Exchanges have liquidity limits, and trying to offload huge sums quickly can depress the price and raise suspicions. Therefore, the process often involves smaller, incremental cash-outs over extended periods. Evolving Security and Tracking Technologies: The cryptocurrency industry is constantly evolving, with advancements in blockchain analytics and security measures. As tracking tools become more sophisticated, launderers need to adapt their techniques, leading to a cat-and-mouse game that prolongs the laundering timeline. The Chilling Example: Funds Stolen in 2016 Still Held in 2022 To underscore the protracted nature of this process, Eric Wall pointed out a stark example: North Korea was still holding onto funds stolen crypto in 2016 as late as 2022! This six-year gap vividly illustrates the immense time and effort involved in successfully laundering large sums of cryptocurrency. It’s a testament to the challenges even sophisticated cybercriminal organizations face in converting digital loot into usable assets. What Does This Mean for the Crypto World? The Lazarus Group’s meticulous and lengthy crypto theft and laundering operation has significant implications for the cryptocurrency ecosystem: Increased Security Awareness: It highlights the ongoing and evolving threat of state-sponsored hacking groups targeting the crypto space. Exchanges, DeFi platforms, and individual investors need to remain vigilant and continuously improve their security measures. Importance of Regulatory Compliance: The need for robust KYC/AML regulations within the crypto industry is further emphasized. While regulations can be burdensome, they are crucial in deterring and disrupting money laundering activities and maintaining the integrity of the crypto market. Advancements in Blockchain Analytics: The ability to track and trace stolen funds, even years later, demonstrates the growing sophistication of blockchain analytics tools. Continued development in this area is vital for law enforcement and security firms to combat crypto crime effectively. Long-Term Impact on Crypto Prices and Trust: Large-scale thefts and subsequent laundering attempts can impact market sentiment and potentially exert downward pressure on cryptocurrency prices, at least temporarily. Furthermore, it erodes trust in the security and stability of the crypto ecosystem if not addressed effectively. Can Lazarus Group Ever Be Stopped? Stopping a group like Lazarus Group is a complex international challenge. It requires a multi-pronged approach involving: International Cooperation: Cybercrime transcends borders, necessitating strong collaboration between law enforcement agencies worldwide to track, investigate, and prosecute these groups. Enhanced Cybersecurity Measures: Continuously improving cybersecurity defenses across the crypto industry is paramount. This includes strengthening exchange security, promoting secure wallet practices, and developing more resilient blockchain infrastructure. Sanctions and Financial Countermeasures: Governments can impose sanctions and financial restrictions to limit the Lazarus Group’s access to the global financial system and disrupt their funding sources. Blockchain Analytics and Intelligence Sharing: Leveraging advanced blockchain analytics and sharing intelligence about known laundering patterns can help identify and intercept illicit transactions more effectively. The Lingering Shadow of Crypto Theft The saga of Lazarus Group’s crypto theft and laundering activities serves as a stark reminder of the persistent threats in the digital asset landscape. While the transparency of blockchain offers tools to track illicit funds, the determination and sophistication of groups like Lazarus Group highlight the ongoing need for vigilance, innovation in security, and global cooperation to safeguard the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The years-long laundering process is a testament to both the challenges faced by cybercriminals and the slow but steady progress in combating crypto crime.

Is the Bull Run Losing Steam?,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-whales-profits-plummet-is-the-bull-run-losing-steam/,"The post Bitcoin Whales’ Profits Plummet! Is the Bull Run Losing Steam? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News At the start of this month, the price of Bitcoin was around $102,398.17. Since then, the market has experienced a decline of 5.77%. In the previous month, the market witnessed a surge of at least 9.54%. Unsurprisingly, a report suggests that large BTC holders have seen lower realised profits this month compared to January. Let’s take a closer look. Bitcoin Whales Made Less Profit in February According to the report, earlier in the year, large BTC holders made approximately $3 billion in realised profits. The same report shows that large BTC holders, holding 10 to 10,000 BTC, have seen lower realised profits this month compared to January. Huge Profits in January – But Why the Change? At the beginning of the year, the price of BTC was $93,569.38. Between January 1 and 6, the market sharply climbed by 9.25%. However, between January 7 and 9, the market dropped by 9.46%. Later, with a sharp upward momentum of 14.61%, the market recovered from the previous correction. Between January 16 and 31, the market remained within the range of $99,995 and $106,190. At a point on January 20, the market touched as high as $109,603.27. In January, 2025, the BTC market recorded a growth of 9.54% – far higher than the 0.87% growth experienced the same month in the previous year. It appears that market conditions may have encouraged large BTC holders to take profit in January. Bitcoin Price Remains Strong Above $90,000 in February Notably, though large BTC holders have seen lower realised profits in February, the BT market has not experienced significant price drops. In the first two days of February, the Bitcoin market plummeted sharply by 4.68%. At a point on February 3, the market touched a low of $91,235.33. However, on February 5, the market entered a range of $98,305.18 and $95,666.64. As of now, the BTC price stands at $96,472.30, indicating that the market still remains inside this range. The current price trend indicates that the Bitcoin market remains stable above $90,000. Are Bitcoin Whales Changing Their Market Strategy? The stability suggests that selling pressure from whales is controlled. Instead of mass selling, large holders seem to be adjusting their approach. What this indicate is a long-term confidence among large Bitcoin holders in the price of BTC. In conclusion, if whales continue holding rather than selling aggressively, Bitcoin could maintain strong price levels.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 06:44:54

However, it’s essential for the OG meme to remain above a certain support, which has historically led to impressive runs. The most critical support zone for #Dogecoin $DOGE is between $0.19 and $0.16. If this level holds, the $3 target remains a strong possibility. pic.twitter.com/VZyqSM2p8U — Ali (@ali_charts) February 22, 2025 It’s safe to say that the post-US-election mania has faded for many crypto assets, and some, such as DOGE, has returned to levels close to those before November 5. Recall that Dogecoin’s price had soared to roughly $0.5 after Trump won the elections but now struggles to remain above $0.25 after a 31% monthly decline. Nevertheless, the OG meme token has seen worse, even during this cycle, as it slumped toward $0.2 on a couple of occasions in times of substantial price crashes. According to the popular analyst Ali Martinez, though, the asset still has a chance to resume its rally and head toward uncharted territory. To do so, it needs to sustain the $0.19 support line, which he labeled as ‘the most crucial’ zone. He added that DOGE has been trading inside an ascending channel for years and has ‘tended to rebound’ from the lower boundary since 2014 and head toward the upper one. The most recent such bounce-off occurred during the early February massacre , which could be the propeller for a surge toward $3 and even $4. “If history repeats, as long as Dogecoin holds above $0.19, it could rally to the resistance trendline at $4.” – Martinez concluded . There’re certainly some bullish developments happening in the Dogecoin ecosystem, such as the multiple filings for a spot DOGE ETF in the US, which many experts believe have a great chance of succeeding under Trump’s administration. Consequently, analysts have outlined impressive price targets for the largest meme coin, and many agree there will be a new all-time high. However, investors should be wary before allocating funds to any assets, particularly meme coins, about the risks of significant volatility and rapid crashes, especially in times of uncertainty that could rattle the entire market, just like yesterday’s hack against Bybit.

Recent analysis suggests a fascinating, and potentially critical, relationship between Bitcoin and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). According to Jamie Coutts, a respected analyst from Real Vision, the inverse correlation between Bitcoin and the DXY has reached extreme levels. This intriguing development could signal significant shifts in global liquidity and market dynamics, creating both opportunities and challenges for crypto investors. Let’s dive deep into what this means for your crypto portfolio and the broader market. Decoding the Bitcoin DXY Correlation: What’s the Hype? For those new to market analysis, understanding the Bitcoin DXY correlation is crucial. The DXY, or U.S. Dollar Index, measures the dollar’s strength against a basket of six major world currencies. Historically, Bitcoin, often seen as a hedge against traditional financial systems, has exhibited an inverse relationship with the DXY. This means when the dollar weakens, Bitcoin tends to rise, and vice versa. But why is this happening now, and why is it considered ‘extreme’? Jamie Coutts highlighted this unusual situation on X, noting that the current Bitcoin inverse correlation with the DXY is reaching levels rarely seen before. He suggests that while a weaker dollar is generally seen as favorable for risk assets like Bitcoin, political factors are currently exerting influence on the DXY. This creates a complex scenario that demands careful attention from investors. Why is the Inverse Correlation Between Bitcoin and DXY Important? Understanding this correlation offers valuable insights into broader market trends and potential investment strategies. Here’s why this relationship matters: Global Liquidity Indicator: A weakening dollar often signals increased global liquidity. When the DXY falls, it generally becomes cheaper for other countries to borrow and invest in dollar-denominated assets, including cryptocurrencies. Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment: A strong dollar often indicates a “risk-off” environment, where investors flock to the safety of the dollar. Conversely, a weaker dollar can suggest a “risk-on” sentiment, encouraging investment in riskier assets like Bitcoin. Investment Strategy Implications: Monitoring the DXY impact on Bitcoin correlation can help investors anticipate potential market movements and adjust their portfolios accordingly. An extreme correlation could indicate either an overextended market condition or an impending significant shift. To illustrate, consider a simplified scenario: DXY Trend Typical Bitcoin Reaction Market Sentiment DXY Decreases (Dollar Weakens) Bitcoin Price Tends to Increase Risk-On DXY Increases (Dollar Strengthens) Bitcoin Price Tends to Decrease Risk-Off Political Factors and the Dollar: What’s Influencing DXY? Coutts points out that political factors are playing a significant role in the current DXY dynamics. This is a crucial element to consider because traditional economic models might not fully capture the impact of geopolitical events on currency valuations. These political influences can include: Geopolitical Instability: Global events, such as conflicts or political uncertainty, can drive investors towards the perceived safety of the U.S. dollar, strengthening the DXY. US Fiscal Policy: Government spending and debt levels can influence investor confidence in the dollar. Aggressive fiscal policies might weaken the dollar over time. Federal Reserve Policy: Interest rate decisions and monetary policy by the Federal Reserve are primary drivers of dollar strength. Hawkish policies tend to strengthen the dollar, while dovish policies can weaken it. These political and economic factors are creating a tug-of-war, potentially contributing to the ‘extreme’ correlation observed. It’s not just about typical market forces; external pressures are adding layers of complexity to the DXY impact on Bitcoin . The Critical Level: 106 on the DXY Coutts specifically mentions the 106 level on the DXY as a critical threshold. He suggests that a drop below 106 would be a “strong bullish signal for global liquidity.” Why is this level so important? Technical Indicator: 106 likely represents a significant support level for the DXY. Breaking below this level could indicate a sustained weakening of the dollar. Liquidity Release: A weaker dollar, as discussed, typically translates to increased global liquidity. This liquidity often flows into various markets, including cryptocurrencies, potentially boosting Bitcoin’s price. Market Confidence: Breaching a key support level can also shift market sentiment. A DXY drop below 106 might instill greater confidence in risk assets and trigger further investment in Bitcoin. Therefore, keeping a close watch on the DXY, particularly around the 106 mark, is vital for anyone involved in the crypto market. This level could act as a key trigger for significant market movements and shifts in the Bitcoin DXY correlation . Navigating the Extreme Correlation: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors do with this information? Here are some actionable insights based on the current Bitcoin market analysis and the extreme DXY correlation: Monitor DXY Closely: Keep an eye on the U.S. Dollar Index, especially the 106 level. Use financial websites or trading platforms to track its movement in real-time. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin shows a strong inverse correlation, diversification remains key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Explore other cryptocurrencies and asset classes to mitigate risk. Stay Informed on Global Politics: Be aware of major geopolitical events and policy changes that could influence the dollar and, consequently, Bitcoin. Use Technical Analysis: Combine DXY analysis with other technical indicators for Bitcoin to make informed trading decisions. Look at Bitcoin’s price charts in conjunction with DXY movements. Manage Risk: Extreme correlations can sometimes revert to the mean. Be prepared for potential shifts in the relationship and manage your risk accordingly. Don’t overextend your positions based solely on this correlation. Is This Extreme Correlation a Golden Opportunity? The current crypto market signals are mixed but intriguing. While an extreme inverse correlation might seem like a straightforward bullish signal for Bitcoin if the DXY weakens, it’s essential to approach with caution. ‘Extreme’ conditions are often unsustainable and can be followed by sharp corrections or shifts in market dynamics. However, this situation also presents a potential golden opportunity. If Coutts is correct and a DXY drop below 106 unleashes significant global liquidity, Bitcoin could indeed see a substantial upward movement. The key is to be prepared, stay informed, and manage risk effectively. This period of extreme correlation could be a time of significant profit potential for those who understand and navigate it wisely. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of Correlation The extreme inverse correlation between Bitcoin and the DXY is a powerful reminder of the interconnectedness of global markets. Jamie Coutts’ analysis highlights a critical juncture where political factors and traditional market dynamics are converging to create unique opportunities and risks in the crypto space. By understanding the Bitcoin DXY correlation , monitoring key levels like 106 on the DXY, and staying informed about broader market influences, investors can better navigate these complex waters and potentially capitalize on the evolving market landscape. The current situation demands vigilance and informed decision-making, but for those prepared, the rewards could be substantial.

This heightened enthusiasm coincides with steady growth in overall crypto market capitalization. KAITO, SEI, and GROK’s Popularity According to Santiment’s February 21 report , KAITO, the native token of AI platform Kaito, is generating significant buzz due to its listings on major exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and KuCoin. Crypto enthusiasts are actively discussing its trading activity, price predictions, and ongoing airdrop claims. The project’s features and tokenomics are further fueling excitement, making it one of the most talked-about assets in the community. Additionally, YAP has emerged as a key term in discussions related to Kaito due to its innovative “tweet-to-earn” mechanism. Developed by the AI platform, the YAP leaderboard incentivizes users to post about crypto on social media. After linking their accounts and crypto wallets, individuals can earn points called “Yaps” based on the engagement on their posts. Santiment highlighted that this system has led to the colloquial use of “yap” as a unit of value or transaction within the Kaito ecosystem. On the other hand, SEI has seen heightened attention following Trump-backed World Liberty Financial’s purchase of 547,990 SEI tokens for $125,000, on its way to amassing a $370 million crypto stash. The analysis reveals that this acquisition has started debates about institutional interest in SEI and its potential impact on the broader crypto market. Grok is trending due to its association with Elon Musk’s latest AI initiative, Grok 3. People have been sharing their experiences with the platform’s real-time knowledge, deep search functionalities, and potential impact on the financial advisory space. Users are also comparing its capabilities to other AI models, particularly in the context of crypto and investment strategies. The excitement is further fueled by the project being free to use. More Trending Tokens Other coins on Santiment’s list include Bitcoin (BTC) and Bittensor (TAO). Bitcoin remains a focal point of conversation, with analysts forecasting significant price milestones. Some projections suggest the coin could go back above $100,000 in the near future and break past the $200,000 level by 2027. Discussions on the flagship cryptocurrency are focused on its current trading status, market cap, and external influences, such as U.S. economic conditions, which could impact its price trajectory. Meanwhile, TAO has gained traction following its recent listing on Coinbase. This has led to speculation about its growth potential and optimism surrounding the dTAO launch. There is also talk about its price movements, with many users expressing positivity about its future performance. Analysts suggest that the token could be entering a bullish phase after a prolonged downtrend, adding to the excitement surrounding its market activity.

The hack triggered reactions from various corners. Elliptic’s Chief Scientist called the hack “the largest crypto theft of all time, by some margin.” Bybit Suffers Largest Hack In History The hack was noticed by on-chain investigator ZachXBT, who flagged suspicious outflows of over $1.4 billion from the crypto exchange. The investigator also listed addresses that were receiving the outflows. Meanwhile, Bybit reported an unauthorized Ethereum (ETH) transfer from its cold wallets due to masked UI spoofing accounts. However, the exchange assured its customers that all other wallets remained secure. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou took X to confirm the hack, stating that the exchange’s multisig cold wallet had been transferred to their warm wallet. According to Zhou, the hackers musked this specific transaction as all the signers saw the masked UI, showing them the correct address and the URL were from the SAFE platform. However, he added that the signing message was to change the smart contract logic of their ETH cold wallet, allowing them to take control of the specific ETH cold wallet they signed and transfer it to an unidentified address. Zhao also assured customers that other wallets were unaffected and that withdrawals were normal. He also called upon teams that could help track the stolen funds. Here is Zhou’s post in full, “Bybit ETH multisig cold wallet just transferred to our warm wallet about 1 hr ago. It appears that this specific transaction was musked, all the signers saw the musked UI, which showed the correct address, and the URL was from @safe. However, the signing message was to change the smart contract logic of our ETH cold wallet. This resulted in Hacker taking control of the specific ETH cold wallet. We signed and transferred all ETH in the cold wallet to this unidentified address. Please rest assured that all other cold wallets are secure. All withdrawals are NORMAL. I will keep you guys posted as more develops. If any team can help us to track the stolen funds, it would be appreciated.” Crypto Ecosystem Reacts Elliptic’s Chief Scientist, Tom Robinson, called the hack the biggest crypto theft of all time by some distance, pointing out the next largest was the $611 million stolen from the Poly Network in 2021. “This makes it the largest crypto theft of all time, by some margin. The next largest crypto theft would be the $611 million stolen from Poly Network in 2021. It may even be the largest single theft of all time. We've labeled the thief's addresses in our software to help prevent these funds from being cashed out through other exchanges.” Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao offered Bybit assistance and suggested pausing withdrawals. “Not an easy situation to deal with. Suggest stopping withdrawals for a bit as a standard security precaution. Will provide any assistance if needed.” Meanwhile, Arkham Intelligence offered a bounty to track down the individual or individuals responsible for the hack. “We’ve created and funded a bounty to help identify the person or organization behind today’s [over] $1 billion Bybit hack. Submissions to this bounty will be shared with the Bybit team to support their investigation. Reward: 50,000 ARKM.” ZachXBT later revealed that the Lazarus Group was responsible. Tron founder Justin Sun said they are closely monitoring the Bybit hack and would offer all assistance in tracking the relevant funds. Bybit Remains Solvent Bybit CEO Zhou assured customers the exchange remains solvent even if the stolen $1.4 billion is not recovered, adding that all client funds are covered 1 to 1, and the exchange can cover all losses. Data from CoinMarketCap shows the exchange had reserve assets worth $16.2 billion before the hack. The stolen funds account for around 8.60% of the platform’s reserves. “Bybit is Solvent, even if this hack loss is not recovered, all of the client assets are 1 to 1 backed. We can cover the loss.” Flashbots strategy head Hasu also stated that despite the scale of the hack, it would not lead to the demise of Bybit, assuring followers the exchange was good for the money. “If you want my serious take, Bybit has way more than 1.4 billion in revenue per year. They are good for the money and will make all customers whole. It doesn't matter for ETH because Bybit will honor customers's ETH liabilities and buy back the assets on the open market.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Despite this dip, three altcoins have stood out due to their potential to swiftly recover from these headwinds. Pi Network Token (PI) Pi Network Token, a newly launched crypto that has already secured the backing of major cryptocurrency exchanges is the best crypto to invest in due to rising market interest. Despite the pullback across the broader market today, Pi Coin is up by 8.5% to trade at $0.756. The altcoin has jumped by 23% from its all-time low of $0.61 registered on February 20, 2025. After experiencing intense selling activity in the last two days, Pi Coin is recovering to target resistance at $0.80. A swing above this level could lead to gains past $1, paving the way for a rally to the $3.4 all-time high . Given that the Pi network token is barely three days old, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) to measure buying activity and momentum can only be tracked on a 15-minute chart. The RSI has risen to 64 after making a series of highs, suggesting that buying pressure is growing and the momentum is bullish. PI/USDT: 15M Chart This bullish outlook makes the Pi token a top crypto to buy to mitigate the risks of a possible Ethereum selloff. Ripple (XRP) Ripple price has retained its bullish outlook despite the recent pullback, making it a top crypto to buy for Korean investors. XRP price today trades at $2.58 and continued to defend support at an ascending channel, suggesting a bullish continuation. After bouncing yet again from the lower trendline of the ascending parallel channel, XRP needs to flip the midline for a sustained uptrend to the upper trendline. The key resistance level to watch for this altcoin is $2.83. XRP/USDT: 4H Chart Ripple is also on the verge of a breakthrough in its legal case with the US securities regulator, which is bullish for the XRP price. According to Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terett, the SEC is likely to “ favorably settle cases ” with crypto firms under the new SEC Chair. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin has outperformed the altcoin market in the last month, making it one of the best cryptos to buy after the Bybit hack. For context, Bitcoin’s dominance has gradually risen and recently reached its highest level since 2021. Bitcoin Dominance When Bitcoin’s dominance rises, it shows that BTC is outperforming altcoins, or that its declines have been marginal compared to those of altcoins. Such a rise also shows that crypto investors are moving from riskier altcoins to Bitcoin. Therefore, it makes sense that investors could start buying Bitcoin after the $1.5 billion Ethereum hack on Bybit. Conclusion: Best Korean Crypto to Buy Traders looking for the best crypto to buy after the Bybit hack can explore Pi Network Token, XRP, or Bitcoin. These coins have a strong bullish setup and the ability to gain or outperform the broader market even if the North Korean Lazarus hacker group starts selling off ETH.

40676220,134cd348-2790-4a4d-996a-c5a5439850c4,1740208177,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/40676220.jpeg,Arthur Hayes Proposes Rolling Back Ethereum Network to Negate $1.4B Bybit Hack,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/02/22/arthur-hayes-proposes-rolling-back-ethereum-network-to-negate-usd1-4b-bybit-hack,"Arthur Hayes, BitMEX co-founder and major ether (ETH) holder, asked Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin to rollback the network in order to assist hacked exchange Bybit, which lost nearly $1.4 billion in ether (ETH) on Friday. ""@VitalikButerin will you advocate to roll back the chain to help @Bybit_Official. My own view as a mega $ETH bag holder is $ETH stopped being money in 2016 after the DAO hack hardfork. If the community wanted to do it again, I would support it because we already voted no on immutability in 2016 [wh]y not do it again?"" Hayes said on X. Buterin was yet to reply as of time of publication. The Bybit hack came into light on Friday when on-chain analyst ZachXBT noted suspicious outflows of over $1.4 billion from the exchange, with the attacker quickly swapping mETH and stETH for ether through a decentralized exchange. The attacker then split 10,000 ETH to 39 different addresses and another 10,000 ETH to nine addresses, Gautham Santhosh, co-founder of Polynomial.fi, explained on X. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou said that the hacker ""took control of the specific ETH cold wallet and transferred all the ETH in the cold wallet to this unidentified address."" Zhou confirmed that the exchange ""is solvent even if this hack loss is not recovered."" One of the potential ways to address hacking is to roll back the blockchain. It involves reverting the blockchain to a state before the occurrence of a specific event, in this case, the hack. That way, malicious transactions resulting from the hack can be erased, effectively restoring lost or stolen funds. Implementing a rollback requires consensus from the network participants. For instance, in 2016, the Ethereum network was rolled back using a hard fork to reverse a theft of $60 million in ether from The DAO (30% of all ETH in circulation back then). The hard fork split the chain into two – Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. In 2019, Binance's CEO Changpeng Zhao and his team considered pushing for a rollback on the Bitcoin network following a $40 million hack. However, the Bitcoin mining community criticized the idea of going back against the principle of decentralization and immutability, which are fundamental to blockchain technology. Immutability is a security feature that prevents data from being changed after it's added to the blockchain to make it trustworthy and tamper-proof. There are similar concerns regarding a potential Ethereum rollover. ""I wish we could roll back for the Bybit hack, I'm not against the idea. But the DAO hack was 15% of ETH with a clean recovery path. Today, a rollback would break bridges, stablecoins, L2s, RWAs and so much more. ETH ecosystem is just too interconnected now for a clean solution like 2016,"" Santhosh said. Sina 21st Capital explained that Ethereum is now stuck between a rock and a hard place. ""Ethereum is toast. They can roll back the chain and destroy what is left of the decentralization claim or allow North Korean baad actors to keep $1.4B of ETH and unleash an eternal internal battle. Either way, it is terrible,"" Sina 21st Capital said on X . Ether has dropped nearly 3% in 24 hours, but continues to trade rangebound between $2,600 and $2,800, CoinDesk data show.",Markets|Hack|Ethereum|Bybit|Vitalik Buterin|Arthur Hayes,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FORKS|BLOCKCHAIN|ETC|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-22 07:09:37

This article dives into the negative implications of memecoins, exploring how they distort markets, invite scams, undermine the promise of blockchain technology and interfere with market cycles by diverting and diluting liquidity that would otherwise go to promising projects with actual utility. AI agents in cryptocurrency are autonomous software programs powered by artificial intelligence that operate within blockchain and crypto ecosystems to perform specific tasks with little to no human intervention. The cryptocurrency market has always been a rollercoaster of innovation, speculation, and volatility. In recent years, memecoins — cryptocurrencies born from internet memes or humorous concepts like Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ), Shiba Inu ( SHIB-USD ), and newer entries like $TRUMP or $HAWK — have surged into the spotlight. Fueled by social media hype, celebrity endorsements, and retail investor fervor, memecoins have ballooned into a $100 billion-plus market segment by late 2024. While they’ve brought new users and excitement to crypto, their rise comes with serious downsides that threaten the industry’s credibility, stability, and long-term growth. This article dives into the negative implications of memecoins, exploring how they distort markets, invite scams, undermine the promise of blockchain technology and interfere with market cycles by diverting and diluting liquidity that would otherwise go to promising projects with actual utility. A Distorted Market: Speculation Over Substance Memecoins thrive on hype, not utility. Unlike Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), designed as a decentralized currency, or Ethereum, a platform for smart contracts, most memecoins offer little to no real-world function. Their value hinges on viral attention — think Elon Musk tweeting about Dogecoin or Iggy Azalea launching Mother Iggy (MOTHER) with a cheeky butt-themed logo. This speculation-first approach sucks oxygen from projects with genuine innovation. In Q1 2024, top memecoins posted returns over 1,300%, outpacing many fundamentally strong altcoins. Retail investors, chasing quick riches, pour money into these tokens, leaving less capital for decentralized finance (DeFi), privacy coins, or scalable blockchains. This skews the market’s priorities. Developers and founders of legitimate projects struggle to stand out amid the memecoin noise. Why grind on a complex protocol when a dog-themed token can hit a billion-dollar market cap overnight? The result is a “clown show” perception — regulators and traditional finance see crypto as a casino, not a transformative technology. Posts on X echo this frustration, with users lamenting how memecoins have “fucked the altcoin market” by turning it into “literal gambling.” The data backs this up: by December 2024, memecoins dropped 30% in market cap in a single month, dragging down broader sentiment as speculative bubbles burst. More recently, we can see the following declines for leading memecoins in the past month: DOGE -34% SHIB -27% PEPE ( PEPE-USD ) -41% TRUMP ( TRUMP-USD ) -57% BONK ( BONK-USD ) -54% Memecoins turn crypto into a speculative gamble, akin to a slot machine. Memecoins’ low entry barriers — thanks to platforms like Pump.Fun, which spawned 4.7 million tokens in 2024 — make them a breeding ground for scams. Rug pulls, where creators hype a coin then vanish with liquidity pool funds, are rampant. Take WSB Coin: launched in 2023 by a WallStreetBets moderator, it crashed after an insider dumped tokens, wiping out investors. Or $HAWK, tied to the “Hawk Tuah” meme, which peaked at $490 million in December 2024 before plummeting 95% as promoters cashed out. Nansen’s February 2025 report on Argentina’s $LIBRA memecoin is even grimmer: 86% of traders lost $251 million, while insiders pocketed $180 million. Pump-and-dump schemes are just as common. Influencers and celebrities — like Caitlyn Jenner or Andrew Tate in 2024 — hype tokens on social media, driving prices up before selling at the peak. Cointelegraph notes influencers now face fines for such antics, but the damage is done: latecomers, often less savvy retail investors, bear the losses. The blockchain’s transparency catches some culprits — X posts from 2024 warned “it’s forever immutable” — yet enforcement lags, and scammers adapt with fake presales or phishing tricks. This erodes trust in crypto, especially among newcomers lured by memecoin hype only to get burned. Investors should be careful trusting social media personalities that only show their wins and ignore all of their losses. Most memecoin pumps require investors to be in within the first hour and out within another hour or two to capture any profit. It is mostly insiders that know about a coin launching ahead of the public that are able to capture large gains. In the equity markets, this is considered insider trading and is illegal and punishable by jail time. Regulatory Blowback: A Hammer Waiting to Fall Memecoins' antics don’t just hurt wallets — they invite regulatory crackdowns. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has long eyed crypto for securities violations, and memecoins are low-hanging fruit. A July 2024 Cointelegraph piece flagged how celebrity shilling — like Jason Derulo’s token flops — could breach U.S. laws if marketed as investments. The Howey Test, which defines securities, considers “marketing” a factor; memecoin ads screaming “to the moon” fit the bill. Dogwifhat’s (WIF) $600,000 Las Vegas Sphere stunt in 2024? That’s a red flag to regulators. When memecoins dominate, they paint crypto as unserious, slowing mainstream adoption. Serious players — banks, governments — hesitate to engage with a market where a squirrel-themed coin (PNUT) hits $1.2 billion after a viral euthanization story. Institutional investors, who tripled memecoin holdings to $204.8 million by March 2024, might rethink their bets if regulators clamp down. An X user in February 2025 warned Solana’s memecoin craze risks it becoming a “meme chain” under scrutiny, not a credible Layer 1 blockchain. The fallout? Tighter rules, higher compliance costs, and a harder road for legitimate projects. The industry has worked too hard for regulatory clarity and to remove regulatory risk, just to allow a small group of shady KOLs to profit from the demise of other crypto investors in a zero-sum game. Memecoins’ wild ride could bring down the regulatory gavel on crypto. Liquidity and Volatility: A House of Cards Memecoins’ speculative nature creates a liquidity nightmare. With prices driven by tweets or TikTok trends, not fundamentals, they’re prone to violent swings. December 2024 saw a 32% memecoin market cap drop — from $137 billion to $92 billion — in weeks, per CoinMarketCap. Low liquidity amplifies this: sparse traders mean wide bid-ask spreads and easy manipulation. Whales can spike prices, then yank liquidity, leaving others stranded. High leverage in memecoin markets — common on decentralized exchanges — turns small dips into cascading sell-offs, as OneSafe’s blog noted in 2024. This volatility spills over. When Dogecoin tumbled 25% post-Fed meeting in December 2024, it hit harder than Bitcoin’s dip, per Fortune Crypto. Memecoins’ “beta bet” status — leveraged plays on native tokens like Solana’s SOL — means their crashes can drag down bigger ecosystems. ScienceDirect’s 2021 study found memecoins’ positive net spillovers signal bubbles that crash leading coins like Bitcoin. Retail investors, burned by these swings, may abandon crypto entirely, shrinking the market’s base. The Cultural Cost: Undermining Crypto’s Vision Crypto began with a promise: decentralization, financial sovereignty, a better system. Memecoins mock that. They’re not about empowerment — they’re about “degeneracy,” as Azeem Khan told WIRED in January 2025. The focus shifts from building to gambling, from utility to absurdity. Medium’s Gaze All Over argued in 2024 that memecoins “represent everything wrong” with crypto’s value system, burying meaningful projects under hype. Even their upside — drawing newbies — fades when those newbies lose it all and leave disillusioned. The community angle, a memecoin selling point, often masks grift. Shiba Inu’s ecosystem (Shibarium, ShibaSwap) tries to add utility, but most memecoins remain digital collectibles at best, Ponzi schemes at worst. X posts in 2025 called them “thousands upon thousands” of gambling tokens, diluting crypto’s ethos. If the market becomes a meme-fueled casino, the dream of a decentralized future fades. AI Agents Offers Better Promise than Memecoins AI agents can offer the same artistic and comedic value of a memecoin, but with actual utility. AI agents in cryptocurrency are autonomous software programs powered by artificial intelligence that operate within blockchain and crypto ecosystems to perform specific tasks with little to no human intervention. Think of them as smart digital assistants tailored for the fast-paced, decentralized world of crypto. Unlike traditional trading bots that follow rigid, pre-set rules, AI agents can learn, adapt, and make decisions based on real-time data, leveraging machine learning (ML), large language models (LLMs), and other AI techniques. They’re reshaping how users interact with cryptocurrencies, from trading to managing decentralized finance ((DEFI)) protocols, and even sparking new market trends. Some AI agents have even built businesses autonomously, given access to crypto wallets to deploy capital into the real world. Some have created music, promoted it on social media and generated revenue from streaming songs, all with little to no human intervention. Other AI agents are able to manage investment portfolios, filtering through magnitudes more data than a human could ever accomplish and doing it 24/7. Imagine a personal trader that never sleeps, constantly scans the market, and adjusts your portfolio while you’re offline — that’s an AI agent in crypto. With this great access to data, financials, emerging trends and the ability to trade faster on news, AI Agent investing bots or AI Agent hedge funds are already showing the promise to outperform human-led hedge funds or investment advisors by a wide margin. AI agents follow a dynamic process: Data Collection: They pull in massive amounts of data — blockchain transactions, market prices, social media sentiment (e.g., X posts), news feeds, or even key opinion leader (KOL) chatter. Analysis: Using ML algorithms or LLMs (like those behind ChatGPT), they process this data to spot patterns, predict trends, or assess risks. For example, an agent might analyze 400+ influencers’ takes to gauge a token’s hype. Decision-Making: Based on their analysis, they decide what to do — buy, sell, swap tokens, adjust a portfolio, or even mint a new coin. Execution: They act on-chain, interacting with smart contracts or wallets to carry out trades or other tasks autonomously. Learning: Over time, they refine their strategies, getting smarter with each cycle. Of course, not all AI agents are created equally and many are just glorified chatbots. So, investors need to be analyze the market closely and be very selecting when investment in AI Agent tokens. By February 20, 2025, AI agent tokens hit a $7 billion market cap (CoinGecko), with forecasts eyeing $40 billion in five years. They’re not just tools — they’re becoming economic players, holding wallets, driving trends, and reshaping crypto’s narrative. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong predicts “hundreds of millions” of agents, while Crypto.com’s Eric Anziani sees “trillions of transactions” on-chain. Posts on X hype them as “the future of trading,” flagging scams or minting memecoins in seconds. Until today, AI Agents mostly traded on decentralized exchanges and were not able to secure listings on major centralized exchanges. But Coinbase just listed Bittensor (TAO-USD) and the token is up 22% in the past week alone. Bittensor is an open-source protocol that utilizes blockchain technology to create a decentralized machine learning network. It is the largest market cap token focused on AI in the crypto sector, but is still not well understood. Bittensor’s vision for a decentralized AI company has captivated a large number of people in the arenas of Artificial Intelligence and computer science, who have yearned for an alternative to the top-down world being created by our current technology giants. At Nicoya Research, we think there is significant upside ahead for TAO over the next 6 months. But we also hold a number of smaller-cap AI plays that are more focused on the development of AI agents. Most of these tokens had a massive run higher at the end of 2024 and into January 2025. Many of these tokens that we hold or track increased 10x or more in value during that time period, but have since given back most of those gains. This dip following the initial mania might provide investors that missed the first explosive move higher with another opportunity to buy at oversold valuations. Conclusion: A Reckoning Looms Memecoins are a double-edged sword. They’ve injected energy and users into crypto, but the cost is steep: distorted markets, rampant scams, regulatory risk, destabilizing volatility, and a tarnished mission. The $100 billion memecoin market of 2024 may grow “crazier,” as Khan predicts, but bubbles burst. When they do, the fallout could stall crypto’s progress for years. Investors should tread carefully — blockchain tracks every move — and the industry must refocus on substance over memes. A better alternative for cryptocurrency investors may be in Artificial Intelligence Agents that run on blockchains and have access to capital (crypto) to actually generate value in the real world. This generated value can be returned to token holders. Taking it a step further, AI Agents have the potential to free humanity from monotonous busy work and allow more free time to pursue true passions during our short trip on this planet. There is an upside to humanity in their development, which is more than can be said about the current memecoin craze.

40676556,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133014,1740208764,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Urgent Relief: Bybit Withdrawals Fully Restored After Lazarus Group Hack, Security Overhaul Coming",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bybit-withdrawals-restored-security/,"In a sigh of relief for Bybit users, CEO Ben Zhou has officially announced the complete restoration of the exchange’s withdrawal system. This welcome news follows a challenging period sparked by a significant security breach. If you were among those anxiously awaiting access to your funds on Bybit, you can now breathe easy. But what exactly happened, and what steps are being taken to prevent future incidents and enhance crypto exchange security ? Let’s dive into the details of this developing story. Bybit Withdrawals Back Online: What Happened? The crypto world was recently shaken by news of a substantial hack targeting Bybit, with reports indicating a staggering $1.46 billion in ETH stolen from their cold wallets. Attribution pointed towards North Korea’s notorious Lazarus Group, known for their sophisticated cybercriminal activities. This attack understandably caused panic and disruption, leading to temporary suspension of Bybit withdrawals . Here’s a quick rundown of the key events: Security Breach: Bybit experienced a sophisticated cold wallet hack, allegedly perpetrated by the Lazarus Group. Withdrawal Suspension: As a precautionary measure, Bybit temporarily halted withdrawals to address the security vulnerability and secure user funds. Swift Response: The Bybit team worked diligently to investigate the breach, restore the withdrawal system, and implement enhanced security protocols. Full Restoration: CEO Ben Zhou confirmed via X (formerly Twitter) that Bybit withdrawals are now fully operational, with all pending requests processed without delay. CEO Ben Zhou’s Assurance: More Security Measures on the Horizon In his official announcement, Ben Zhou , CEO of Bybit, conveyed a message of transparency and reassurance. He apologized for the inconvenience caused by the withdrawal suspension and expressed gratitude to the Bybit community for their patience and support. Crucially, Zhou emphasized that this incident is a catalyst for strengthening Bybit’s security infrastructure. Here are the key takeaways from Ben Zhou’s statement: Withdrawals Fully Restored: The primary message is clear – users can now access their funds without any issues. Incident Report Coming: Bybit is committed to transparency and will release a detailed incident report outlining the events that transpired. New Security Measures: Zhou promised the imminent implementation of enhanced security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future and bolster overall crypto exchange security . Gratitude and Commitment: He thanked users, partners, and friends for their support, acknowledging that strengthening security is an ongoing process. Lazarus Group Hack: A Stark Reminder of Crypto Security Threats The alleged involvement of the Lazarus Group hack in this incident underscores the persistent and evolving threats within the cryptocurrency space. The Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, is notorious for targeting financial institutions and cryptocurrency platforms to generate revenue for the regime. Their methods are sophisticated, often involving advanced persistent threats (APTs) and meticulous planning. This incident serves as a potent reminder of several critical aspects: Cold Wallet Vulnerabilities: Even cold wallets, designed for offline storage and enhanced security, are not entirely impervious to sophisticated attacks. State-Sponsored Actors: The involvement of state-sponsored groups like the Lazarus Group signifies the high stakes and resources involved in cryptocurrency cybercrime. Importance of Vigilance: Both exchanges and individual users must remain vigilant and proactive in adopting robust security practices to mitigate risks. Ongoing Security Evolution: The cybersecurity landscape is constantly changing, requiring continuous adaptation and improvement of security measures within the crypto industry. Strengthening Crypto Security Measures: What Can Exchanges Do? In the wake of incidents like the Lazarus Group hack targeting Bybit, the spotlight intensifies on the crucial need for robust crypto security measures . What concrete steps can cryptocurrency exchanges take to safeguard user assets and maintain trust in the ecosystem? Here are some key areas of focus: Security Measure Description Benefit Multi-Signature Wallets Requiring multiple private keys to authorize transactions, adding layers of security. Reduces single points of failure and makes unauthorized access significantly harder. Regular Security Audits Independent security firms conduct thorough assessments of systems and infrastructure. Identifies vulnerabilities and weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious actors. Advanced Intrusion Detection Systems Real-time monitoring of network traffic and system activity to detect and respond to threats. Enables rapid response to security breaches, minimizing potential damage. Employee Security Training Educating employees about phishing attacks, social engineering, and secure coding practices. Reduces human error, a significant factor in many security breaches. Bug Bounty Programs Incentivizing ethical hackers to identify and report security vulnerabilities. Leverages the wider security community to proactively find and fix weaknesses. Enhanced KYC/AML Procedures Strengthening Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes. Helps prevent illicit activities and reduces the risk of the platform being used for illegal purposes. Actionable Insights: What Crypto Users Should Consider While exchanges bear the primary responsibility for platform security, individual users also play a vital role in safeguarding their crypto assets. Here are some actionable insights for crypto users to enhance their personal security: Use Strong, Unique Passwords: Employ complex passwords and avoid reusing them across multiple platforms. Consider using a password manager. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Activate 2FA on all crypto exchange accounts and wallets for an extra layer of security. Be Phishing Aware: Exercise caution with emails, messages, and links, especially those requesting personal information or login credentials. Use Hardware Wallets: For long-term storage of significant crypto holdings, consider using hardware wallets for offline cold storage. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest security news and best practices in the cryptocurrency space. Conclusion: A Renewed Focus on Crypto Exchange Security Bybit’s swift response to the security breach and the full restoration of Bybit withdrawals are positive developments. However, the incident, allegedly linked to the Lazarus Group hack , serves as a critical wake-up call for the entire cryptocurrency industry. The promise of enhanced security measures from Bybit, and hopefully from other exchanges as well, signals a renewed commitment to protecting user assets and fostering a more secure crypto ecosystem. As the industry matures, prioritizing robust security will be paramount to building trust and ensuring the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies.

40676611,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133015,1740208854,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Sudden $67M ETH Exodus: Why Galaxy Digital Pulled Funds from Bybit Crypto Exchange?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/galaxy-digital-eth-withdrawal-bybit/,"In a noteworthy crypto market move, prominent institutional player Galaxy Digital has initiated a significant withdrawal of Ethereum (ETH) from the Bybit exchange. On-chain data reveals that an address linked to Galaxy Digital’s over-the-counter (OTC) trading operations transferred a substantial 25,000 ETH, valued at approximately $67.12 million, out of Bybit just an hour ago, according to insights from Arkham Intelligence. This sudden and substantial transaction has sparked curiosity and speculation within the cryptocurrency community, raising questions about the motivations behind this large-scale asset movement. Why Did Galaxy Digital Initiate This Massive ETH Withdrawal? The withdrawal of 25,000 ETH by Galaxy Digital from Bybit is not an isolated event. Data from Arkham Intelligence further indicates that within the preceding 40 minutes, the same address associated with Galaxy Digital also executed withdrawals of around 200,000 USDC and an additional 90 ETH. This series of transactions suggests a deliberate and potentially strategic asset reshuffling by Galaxy Digital. But what could be driving this activity? Let’s delve into some potential reasons: Strategic Asset Rebalancing: Institutional investors like Galaxy Digital frequently manage vast portfolios across multiple exchanges and custody solutions. This ETH withdrawal could be part of a routine asset rebalancing strategy, optimizing their holdings based on market conditions, risk assessments, or internal investment mandates. They might be consolidating assets for better management or redeploying capital into different opportunities. OTC Trading Desk Operations: Galaxy Digital’s OTC trading desk facilitates large-volume cryptocurrency trades for institutional clients. Withdrawals of this magnitude could be directly related to fulfilling client orders or managing inventory for upcoming trades. The crypto exchange landscape is dynamic, and OTC desks need to ensure they have sufficient liquidity to meet client demands. Risk Mitigation Post-Bybit Hack: It’s crucial to remember that Bybit recently experienced a significant security breach, suffering a $1.4 billion ETH theft attributed to the North Korean Lazarus Group. While Bybit has taken steps to address the aftermath of this hack, institutional investors like Galaxy Digital, known for their risk-averse approach, might be proactively reducing their exposure on exchanges that have faced recent security challenges. This ETH withdrawal could be a precautionary measure to safeguard assets. Seeking Better Yield Opportunities: The decentralized finance (DeFi) space offers various yield-generating opportunities. Galaxy Digital might be moving these assets to participate in staking, lending, or other DeFi protocols to enhance returns. Institutional investors are increasingly exploring DeFi for yield enhancement, and moving ETH off centralized exchanges could be a step in this direction. Understanding Galaxy Digital’s Role in the Crypto Ecosystem Galaxy Digital, founded by Michael Novogratz, is a leading financial services and investment management innovator in the digital asset, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology sectors. They are a prominent player catering to institutional investors seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency market. Their services span across: Service Area Description Significance Asset Management Offers a range of crypto investment funds and strategies. Provides structured investment vehicles for institutional participation. Trading Operates an OTC trading desk facilitating large crypto transactions. Enables discreet and efficient execution of substantial trades. Investment Banking Advises crypto companies on fundraising and M&A activities. Supports the growth and maturation of the crypto industry. Mining Engages in Bitcoin mining operations. Contributes to the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Galaxy Digital’s activities provide crucial infrastructure and access points for traditional financial institutions to enter the crypto space. Their movements, like this recent ETH withdrawal , are closely watched as indicators of institutional sentiment and broader market trends. Bybit’s Security Challenges: A Lingering Concern? Bybit, while a popular crypto exchange with a wide range of trading products and services, has recently been under scrutiny due to a significant security breach. The $1.4 billion ETH theft, attributed to the Lazarus Group, is a stark reminder of the inherent risks associated with centralized exchanges. While Bybit has reportedly taken measures to compensate affected users and bolster its security protocols, the incident undoubtedly casts a shadow. For institutional investors like Galaxy Digital, security is paramount. The Lazarus Group hack might have prompted a reassessment of risk exposure on Bybit, leading to a more cautious approach. This doesn’t necessarily imply a lack of confidence in Bybit’s future security measures, but rather reflects a prudent risk management strategy in the wake of a major security event. The timing of this ETH withdrawal shortly after reports about the hack recovery certainly raises questions about a possible correlation. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? While the exact reasons behind Galaxy Digital’s ETH withdrawal remain speculative, this event offers several actionable insights for crypto market participants: Institutional Activity is a Key Market Driver: Transactions of this scale highlight the growing influence of institutional players in the crypto market. Their actions can significantly impact market liquidity and price movements. Monitoring institutional flows becomes increasingly important for understanding market dynamics. Security Remains Paramount for Exchanges: The Bybit hack underscores the critical importance of robust security measures for crypto exchanges . Users, especially institutional clients, will likely prioritize exchanges with a proven track record of security and transparency. Exchanges must continuously invest in and enhance their security infrastructure to maintain trust and attract large capital inflows. Risk Management is Crucial for Crypto Investors: Whether you are an individual investor or a large institution, risk management is essential in the volatile crypto market. Diversifying holdings across multiple exchanges and custody solutions, and staying informed about security risks, are vital practices. Monitor On-Chain Data for Market Signals: On-chain analytics tools like Arkham Intelligence provide valuable insights into market activity. Tracking large withdrawals and inflows can offer early signals of potential market shifts and institutional strategies. Conclusion: A Calculated Move or a Sign of Shifting Tides? Galaxy Digital’s substantial ETH withdrawal from Bybit is a significant event that warrants attention. Whether it’s a routine portfolio rebalancing, OTC desk operations, a risk mitigation strategy following Bybit’s security incident, or a combination of factors, this move underscores the increasing sophistication and institutionalization of the cryptocurrency market. It serves as a reminder of the complex interplay between market dynamics, security considerations, and the strategic decisions of major players like Galaxy Digital. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, keeping a close watch on these large-scale movements will be crucial for navigating the market effectively.

Analyst Explains",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/as-bitcoin-sell-pressure-fades-could-a-local-bottom-be-forming-analyst-explains/,"According to an X post by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin (BTC) is witnessing a decline in sell-side pressure, indicating that a local market bottom may soon form for the premier cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Local Bottom On The Horizon? Bitcoin continues to trade just below the psychologically significant $100,000 level, hovering at $98,650 at the time of writing. However, the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization is witnessing a notable drop in sell-side pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4-Year CAGR Drops To 14.45% But Still Outshines Gold, Stocks – Details Martinez shared the following Bitcoin Sell-Side Risk Ratio chart from crypto analytics platform Glassnode, highlighting a sharp decline in the metric since mid-January 2025. This drop suggests that BTC may be forming a local price bottom, potentially leading to a new accumulation phase. For those unfamiliar, a declining sell-side risk ratio typically indicates that investors are holding onto their BTC rather than selling, signalling the early stages of an accumulation phase where prices may stabilize or begin to rise. Martinez’s analysis aligns with broader crypto market cycle theories, which suggest that market bottoms are often followed by an accumulation phase. This phase, in turn, paves the way for a potential price increase. However, BTC must hold above key support levels to confirm this outlook. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital weighed in on Bitcoin’s price action, emphasizing the importance of a weekly close above $97,000 to maintain its higher low as support. The analyst shared a Bitcoin weekly chart, noting that while BTC has seen multiple wicks below its symmetrical triangle structure, the overall bullish pattern remains intact. However, failure to close above $97,000 on the weekly timeframe could increase the risk of further downside. Similarly, fellow analyst Daan Crypto Trades shared a bullish perspective, pointing out that BTC recently had a “solid break” from a descending channel structure. The analyst added: Just need to see the continuation now into the weekend to get a good base going into next week. $98K is key in the short term. Is BTC Primed For A New All-Time High? While Martinez suggests that BTC may be forming a local bottom, other analysts believe the cryptocurrency is gearing up for a move beyond $108,000, potentially reaching a new all-time high (ATH). Analyst Kevin, for instance, predicts that a short squeeze could propel BTC to $111,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin At Risk? Analyst Says Breaking This Price Level Could Spark Significant Volatility Similarly, recent analysis by Rekt Capital highlights that BTC is showing early signs of a bullish divergence which could break the digital asset’s bearish price momentum. At press time, BTC trades at $98,650, up 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

The firm’s registration statement explicitly mentions staking, which marks a significant move in the evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency-based investment products. According to the filing document, Franklin Templeton’s proposed Solana ETF would allow the fund to engage in staking activities and earn rewards in the form of SOL. “In exchange for any staking activity in which the Fund may participate, the Fund will receive certain staking rewards in Solana tokens, which rewards may be treated as income for the Fund,” the filing said. Franklin Templeton’s move comes amid growing interest in launching Solana ETFs, particularly following changes in SEC leadership and a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. Under the previous administration, former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler took a cautious stance on crypto-related products. However, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs following Grayscale’s landmark lawsuit against the SEC paved the way for Ethereum ETFs and potentially other crypto-based investment vehicles. Related News: Critical Levels to Watch for in Bitcoin Price Amid Hot News Firms seeking approval for their Solana ETFs are now in contact with the SEC to discuss the inclusion of staking. Last week, the agency’s newly formed crypto task force met with Jito Labs and Multicoin Capital to explore the feasibility of staking in exchange-traded products. Similar discussions have occurred regarding Ethereum ETFs. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is seeking permission for staking in Grayscale’s Ethereum ETFs, while Cboe BZX Exchange is seeking approval for 21Shares’ staking-enabled Ethereum ETF. James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, believes that staking will eventually be allowed for all proof-of-stake assets within ETF structures: “At this point, it’s just a matter of when.” While regulatory clarity is still needed, Ethereum ETF staking applications are expected to be reviewed before those for Solana, according to Seyffart. Previously, many firms have removed staking from their ETF applications due to regulatory uncertainty. The SEC has noted that proof-of-stake tokens could be classified as securities, creating hurdles for their inclusion in regulated investment products. *This is not investment advice.

With a 40% purchase bonus and innovative tokenomics, 1Fuel is sparking excitement among crypto enthusiasts and industry experts alike for unprecedented long-term financial gains. Read on to discover how this innovative DeFi coin revolutionizes the market and creates fresh opportunities for seasoned investors and newcomers. JUP investors burned as the so-called best meme coin to invest in collapses Over the past week, the price of JUP tumbled, falling 20% from $0.996 to $0.782 . This decline appears linked to troubles in the Jupiter ecosystem following the Libra token launch. Promoted as the best meme coin to invest in, Libra’s value plummeted within hours, resulting in millions of dollars in losses. In response, Jupiter issued an official statement denying any involvement in the token’s issuance or fundraising and confirmed that no misconduct or insider trading had occurred. These developments have alarmed both investors and market analysts, as trust in JUP and its ecosystem is now at an all-time low. Following this event, JUP traders are beginning to eye 1Fuel, a new DeFi coin that has taken center stage and is expected to surge 100x post-launch. Institutional staking for NEAR goes live amid market volatility On February 20, 2025, Laser Digital launched the NEAR Adoption Fund, providing institutional investors with long-term exposure to NEAR tokens through staking. Powered by TruFin’s TruStake, the fund allows participation in blockchain consensus while earning staking rewards. This initiative aims to drive broader institutional adoption of NEAR, enhancing network security and scalability through increased staking activity. Over the last 20 days, NEAR’s value has fallen by more than 20%, dropping from $4.64 to $3.38 . This decline could be due to NEAR investors taking profits to invest in a new DeFi coin. In recent weeks, NEAR traders have been shifting their focus to 1Fuel, a new DeFi coin that offers a 40% purchase bonus and has 100x growth potential. 1Fuel’s 100x potential: Why traders are making the switch Following significant losses suffered by JUP and NEAR investors, many are now shifting focus to 1Fuel , an innovative DeFi coin offering renewed stability. 1Fuel’s robust tokenomics and advanced features have captured the attention of those seeking a safer investment.

Recently, analysts have revealed a staggering 15,000% ROI potential on emerging 1Fuel (OFT) , a new cryptocurrency with a unique cross-chain transaction feature. Investors from established crypto communities such as XRP and KAS are pouring into 1Fuel’s ongoing presale as talks of two new CEX listings begin. Priced at $0.018 per token, 1Fuel is emerging as one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy for massive gains this year. So, why are key token holders buying 1Fuel? Let’s find out. What drives XRP RLUSD and Kaspa Investors? Compared to Bitcoin which uses a distributed blockchain whose transactions are processed and secured by proof-of-work mining, XRP processes transactions through a network of trusted validators on the XRP Ledger. The XRP RLUSD ledger adoption continues to grow as its total supply exceeded $120 million recently, according to Cryotoquant data. Kaspa on the other hand is driven in recent times by its GHOSTDAG protocol for super-fast transactions and unique blockDAG architecture that boosts scalability within its network. Investors who hold KAS and XRP are known in the crypto market for their adeptness in spotting projects with advanced transaction utility and scalability. This trend is driven by the idea that 1Fuel’s unique offering is far greater than most traditional tokens. In a market where investors are known to hunt for the best cryptocurrencies, this mass migration from XRP and KAS investors is a clear signal of 1Fuel’s high potential Is a 15,000% Potential Possible For 1Fuel? If there’s anything that has proven over the years, it’s that anything is possible in the crypto market. 1Fuel is quickly establishing itself as a game-changing project in the blockchain space. The question then remains, is 1Fuel’s cross-chain interoperability and ultra-fast transaction speed enough to get it to 15,000% ROI? 1Fuel users enjoy a variety of benefits. First, the cross-chain one-click feature brings a new meaning to privacy and affordability. With just one platform, traders can swap KAS for XRP, RLUSD for ADA, and more tokens across 10+ networks without ever leaving the 1Fuel platform. 1Fuel’s in-built privacy mixers and cold-storage solutions are there to ensure that users can move their assets quietly. This is evidenced by the current underground moves XRP and KAS investors are making. No one except the investors knows what’s up. The ongoing 1Fuel presale at just $0.018 has garnered over $2.3 million. With the upcoming launch of 1Fuel’s Beta Wallet, massive limited-time bonuses of up to 40% are currently up for grabs for investors who join the presale early . 1Fuel and CEX listings In One Sentence? What’s happening? As of the time of writing, rumors of two upcoming centralized exchange listings have surfaced in the market. When a token hits a CEX, it is expected to dramatically increase liquidity and expose such crypto to a broader audience. This includes retail and institutional investors alike. If 1Fuel makes it to a major CEX platform, this would not only validate 1Fuel’s credibility in the market but also provide a new gateway for investors using top cryptocurrency wallets to manage their assets. If the listing talks materialize soon, then XRP and KAS investors could see even more dramatic price surges in 1Fuel’s value. Conclusion Innovation and strategic growth are two factors XRP and KAS investors are considering as they shift to 1Fuel. With talks of two major CEX listings on the horizon, 1Fuel is well on its way to becoming a major utility token in the larger crypto market.

Crypto analyst David Leung has provided a detailed breakdown of how the attack unfolded, revealing major lapses in Bybit’s security. Arkham reports that the bybit bybit - Centralised Exchange Crypto trading and Information hack happened through “ Blind Signing ,” a method that lets transactions be approved without seeing all the details. The attackers compromised Bybit’s ETH cold wallet, moving nearly $1.5 billion in assets into one wallet before spreading them across multiple wallets. Draining funds from the most secured platforms reveals the true nature of crypto assets since there are no uniform laws for international crimes it will be difficult for Bybit to recover the losses. In this context, Bybit has announced a 50,000 ARKM bounty for the attackers further investigations are on. Let’s see what happened and how to stay protected. https://twitter.com/dhkleung/status/1893073663391604753 How the Attack Happened The hackers deployed a trojan contract along with a backdoor contract, setting up a trap for Bybit’s upgradeable multisig wallet. They tricked the wallet’s signers into authorizing a seemingly harmless ERC-20 token transfer. However, this transaction contained a delegate call, a function that allowed them to alter the contract’s core logic. Instead of a simple transfer, the attackers used the trojan contract to replace the wallet’s master contract with their own backdoor contract, giving them full control. Once in control, the hackers executed commands to sweep all available ETH, mETH, stETH, and cmETH tokens from the wallet. Interestingly, the backdoor contract was built to do just two things—transfer ETH and ERC-20 tokens to an address of their choosing. This allowed them to quickly drain the funds before Bybit could react. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : North Korean Lazarus Group Behind $1B Bybit Hack – Arkham Intelligence , Security Red Flags Ignored Leung further pointed out several red flags that should have halted the transaction. First of all, the transfer was directed to an unlisted contract that wasn’t ERC-20 compliant, involved zero tokens, and used a delegate call, which modifies contract logic. These loopholes should have triggered a compliance check, yet the transaction was still approved. The fact that these security measures failed suggests the attackers had inside knowledge of Bybit’s operations. Could This Have Been Prevented? David emphasized that stronger pre- and post-signing security checks could have prevented the attack. If independent security layers had reviewed the transaction, they could have identified the suspicious elements before approval. The hack highlights the growing sophistication of crypto attacks and the urgent need for better security protocols in the industry. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Market dips like these often discourage investors, and to see how well XRP will fare for the rest of February, we consulted ChatGPT to predict what the asset’s price will be by March 1. The AI chatbot outlined three potential scenarios for the digital asset based on market factors and historical data. Despite the short-term dip, ChatGPT predicts a bullish scenario is more likely for XRP as it moves toward the end of the month. ChatGPT’s XRP Price Predictions ChatGPT emphasized that its predictions are speculative. However, based on market trends and potential catalysts, the AI model outlines these key scenarios: Bearish Case ($1.50 – $2.00) – If the crypto market faces continued pressure from regulatory uncertainty or economic downturns, XRP could struggle to maintain upward momentum. ChatGPT notes that “if the broader crypto market struggles and regulatory concerns resurface, XRP may face downward pressure.” Neutral Case ($2.50 – $3.00) – In a scenario where XRP continues its current trajectory without major disruptions, the cryptocurrency could remain within a stable range. This would reflect consistent market sentiment without significant bullish or bearish catalysts. This could also place the asset at $3, a level that an analyst recently predicted it would hit . Bullish Case ($3.50 – $5.00+) – If institutional adoption increases and the broader market enters a strong bullish phase, XRP could experience significant upward movement. ChatGPT suggests that rapid institutional growth this month and a market resurgence could push XRP to a new all-time high by March 1. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Will XRP Hit a New All-time High? Another well-respected crypto expert recently stated that banks revealing their partnerships with Ripple to use XRP could play a significant role in the asset’s growth . This massive institutional adoption suggested by ChatGPT could take this form, potentially pushing the digital asset to $5. The SEC has also agreed to dismiss its lawsuit against Coinbase , pending approval from its commissioners. This breakthrough has led many to speculate that the Ripple lawsuit will be dismissed next, and this could send XRP toward the $5 mark if it happens soon. While the current downturn has led to short-term losses, market conditions can rapidly shift in the cryptocurrency space. The potential for increased adoption, regulatory clarity, and improved sentiment in the broader financial markets could help drive XRP higher in the next two weeks.

Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) look set for a strong comeback as their fundamentals remain intact. Meanwhile, Rollblock (RBLK), the fastest growing Web3 gaming platform, could be the biggest winner of the year as analysts predict a potential 50x rally in 2025. Rollblock (RBLK): Disrupting A $500 Billion Industry With Blockchain Transparency Rollblock (RBLK) is bringing a revolutionary blockchain-powered approach to online gaming, eliminating shady, unfair practices and finally returning trust to an industry worth over $500 billion. This approach is clearly paying dividends—In December, the platform saw a 600% surge in new users, with over $1.75 million in wagered bids being placed . With more than 7,000 games on offer and a growing sports prediction league, Rollblock is capturing the attention of both crypto and traditional gaming enthusiasts. All bids are backed up on the immutable Ethereum blockchain to prevent any unscrupulous bid manipulation behind closed doors. Investor demand for RBLK has been rising lately, with the presale already attracting $10.5 million in inflows. Stage 10 tokens are currently priced at $0.06, and with major exchange listings on the horizon, prices are set to rise exponentially this year. For just one week, RBLK is offering an extraordinary 50% bonus on all RBLK purchases, making now the perfect time to take a position. The platform allocates up to 30% of its weekly revenue to buy back RBLK, with 60% of these tokens burned to reduce circulating supply while the remaining 40% funds staking rewards of up to 30% APY. This system supports long-term price appreciation and rewards long-term holders, making RBLK a compelling investment for crypto gem hunters. Cardano (ADA): Coming Upgrade Could Trigger A Recovery Cardano (ADA) has been trading around $0.81 today after gaining 3.3% in the last 24 hours. This is an encouraging sign, although Cardano still has work ahead of it to reverse its 20% decline in the last 30 days. Cardano was unable to sustain its price above $1 and has been struggling to regain any hint of bullish momentum in recent weeks. Despite this, Cardano developers have continued to ship improvements to the chain and the upcoming Ouroboros Leios upgrade could easily be the most bullish yet. Cardano CEO Charles Hoskinson recently announced that his teams are working around the clock to enable this upgrade, which could make Cardano one of the fastest blockchains in existence. If successful, this could propel the Cardano price beyond $3 this year. Solana (SOL): TVL Still Rising Despite Meme Controversy Solana (SOL) has rebounded 4.3% in the past 24 hours, currently trading at $179 after bouncing off support at $160. The Solana network has faced criticism over its handling of recent meme coin launches such as Libra and Melania, which resulted in investors losing hundreds of millions of dollars to insider snipers. However, Solana remains a crypto powerhouse, and its decentralized exchanges processed hundreds of billions of dollars last year. Solana DeFi is booming with $9.3 billion in total value locked right now. The Solana price will likely chop around here for some time before making another run towards $300 in the coming months. Rollblock Blows Its Competition Out Of The Water While Cardano and Solana are set for stunning rebounds, it is becoming clear that Rollblock (RBLK) presents the highest potential for returns this year. With its blockchain-based gaming model, RBLK is poised to challenge major industry players. Early investors could see explosive gains as many predict that its token price could reach $1 this bull run. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

While some traders anticipate a swift move past $2.46, others watch from the sidelines as a newer meme coin, Panshibi (SHIBI) – priced at $0.005 and over $1 million raised – captures attention as it is gearing up for a Coinbase listing. Whether XRP rebounds sharply or Panshibi emerges as the next star, both projects showcase the market’s appetite for high-upside assets. XRP Price Prediction: Eyeing $5? The XRP price prediction often hinges on technical patterns. Ripple’s coin sits at a pivotal $2.40 level, threatening either a breakout to $2.46 or a deeper slip. Some experts foresee a run toward $3.30, $4.20, or even $5.00 if bullish momentum holds. They note a classic triangle formation, a sign of indecision that often leads to volatile moves. Crossing $2.46 could validate an Elliott Wave pattern, ushering in a new cycle of gains. Conversely, losing support near $2.29 might tip XRP below $1.96, dimming hopes for a rally. Beyond charts, speculation about an XRP ETF fuels the XRP price prediction hype. Analysts see regulatory strides following Ripple’s partial legal victories, boosting investor confidence in the token’s longevity. Broader sentiment also matters: if altcoins like Ethereum or top meme coins rally, liquidity may flow into XRP. On the flip side, any negative legal twist or sudden meme coin mania could divert capital elsewhere. Thus, while a break above $2.46 opens a bullish path, caution abounds in an environment still prone to swift reversals. Panshibi (SHIBI): Panda Meme Meets Security While attention centers on the XRP price prediction, Panshibi (SHIBI) emerges as a promising underdog. Its presale, currently trading at $0.005/token, has attracted over $1 million from backers who see comedic branding married to stronger tokenomics. Liquidity is locked for 10 years and team tokens remain locked for two – moves aimed at limiting rug-pull risks that plague smaller meme coins. The panda motif stands out in a world dominated by dog-themed tokens, offering novelty that might appeal to risk-tolerant fans. Panshibi’s AI-driven “social-fi” platform encourages holders to stake, undertake quests and stay active, contrasting tokens that rely solely on fleeting hype. Early adopters argue that with its Coinbase listing soon, $SHIBI could mirror or outpace the gigantic gains once seen by dog-themed peers. This structured approach has lured in some whales who typically favor large-cap projects but now hunger for bigger payoffs. Chart Setups vs. Comedic Fervor While XRP price prediction hinges on chart formations and potential ETF sparks, Panshibi banks on its ability to maintain community interest and attract the interest of big players like Coinbase. Meme tokens flourish or flop on hype cycles and $SHIBI aims to keep traders interested beyond the initial push. By combining comedic flair and tangible security, the coin reflects a pivot in the meme sector, where long-term success might require more than social media surges. If XRP remains range-bound at nearly $2.40, some investors might rotate funds into meme plays like Panshibi. Conclusion This XRP price prediction highlights how traders hope for a break above $2.46, potentially paving the way to $3.30, $4.20, or even $5.00. Yet technical patterns and market sentiment can shift quickly, leaving XRP at risk if it fails to clear resistance or if the broader crypto scene turns negative. Meanwhile, Panshibi (SHIBI) offers a structured meme coin alternative, blending a panda theme with locked liquidity and a structured presale to curb volatility. Whether XRP mounts a significant rally or Panshibi seizes the spotlight, both tokens illustrate the crypto market’s thirst for dramatic returns, driven by chart setups on one side and comedic vigor on the other.

What Is Setting TRUMP Apart From Other Memecoins Trump, with his controversial token launch days before the inauguration, has ushered in a new era of political memecoins. $TRUMP is much more than just a memecoin; it sets the tone, and other politicians worldwide are likely to pay close attention to this development, especially in the context of political fundraising and campaign financing. “Many ‘old school’ politicians will not believe me. In America, at least, the 2026 elections will feature a raft of new personal political brands created via memecoins, and they will defeat supposedly unbeatable incumbents.” (Arthur Hayes, “Zero Knowledge Proof”) At the same time, political tokens are more difficult to regulate. Since they are hosted on blockchains and tradable on decentralized exchanges, they remain accessible to anyone online. This potentially makes them a near-perfect tool for measuring political momentum in real time with minimal government interference. But we are still at the very beginning of this trend and have not yet significantly impacted the mechanics of the memecoin market , known for its (in)famous pumps and dumps. People buy memes to ride another rocket with the multiplier of 10-20x and more. Most traders don’t care about the longer-term developments; they want to make those gains right now. In such a market, buying already ‘shot’ memecoins that have gone through their ‘pump and dump’ cycle is usually not the best idea: most of these tokens will not repeat past returns — largely due to the trivial value dispersion. Few people talk about it in this market, but the value of older memecoins is constantly eroded by the creation of numerous newer ones. A token already delivered 100x gains to early holders faces both profit-taking pressure and competition from fresh narratives. Rather obviously, $TRUMP seems set to break this pattern as it blazes the trail for the emerging #PolitiFi market of real political tokens. But with a market cap of $10.78B, it’s on the verge of becoming an ‘established’ memecoin. Could be a solid investment. But make no mistake – a broader memecoin gambling market grown addicted to pumping low-cap semi-random coins will keep hunting for (and finding) fresh objects for those sweet 20-100x gains, leaving older coins with more “established” profits. “I believe that if crypto sentiment is improving, $TRUMP will lead Bitcoin. If some policy that those in the political know believe will positively impact crypto, $TRUMP will surge well before the positive news is announced, and then Bitcoin will follow.” (Arthur Hayes, “Zero Knowledge Proof”) In Conclusion So those hunting for real 20-100x pumps might want to look at ‘hidden gems’ – tokens positioned to be “next in line” for a pump: trendy enough to be next up, but not yet obvious enough to be ‘priced in’ by the market. As far as I can tell, one such ‘hidden gem’ multiplied by the potential of #PolitiFi as a whole, emerged the day after Trump’s inauguration, when the White House website suddenly removed its Spanish-language version, replacing it with a stern “GO HOME” button under a 404 error message. Though it was quickly amended to “GO TO HOME PAGE,” the internet never forgets, and the incident sparked the creation of the $GOHOME memecoin, which cleverly plays on both immigration sentiment and — smartly enough — the iconic GME (GameStop) ticker. $GOHOME’s origin narrative creates an intriguing positioning play: while clearly resonating with Trump’s immigration stance, the token team carefully avoids explicit political endorsements. This delicate balance keeps the door open for Democratic buyers while maintaining a cheeky undertone that invites all sides to settle their differences through the order book. (Follow @GoHome_Token on X) In light of our earlier discussion about democratizing political markets, this approach feels almost prescient. It turns trading activity itself into a new form of political discourse. Beyond price action, this represents a new form of political engagement where market signals could potentially influence policy decisions more directly than traditional polling or campaign contributions. Easy to Understand: Do you like this politician and want to show your support? Do you believe that other people like this politician or will like this politician in the future? These are the only two questions you have to answer before you decide to buy a political memecoin.” (Arthur Hayes, “Zero Knowledge Proof”) What makes $GOHOME particularly interesting is its timing and positioning. Unlike many PolitiFi tokens that just ride politician popularity, it taps into a core policy issue likely to remain central to Trump’s presidency. And unlike $TRUMP, which has already captured mainstream attention, $GOHOME remains relatively unknown. The project’s approach to treasury management also sets it apart. Rather than selling tokens, the team plans to use them as collateral for loans, reinvesting the proceeds into buying back $GOHOME from the market. This strategy could help maintain price momentum while building longer-term sustainability. While the market cap on some platforms might show around $350M, that represents the Fully Diluted Value (FDV). Given that 95% of the token supply is locked for a considerable period, the actual market cap is closer to 5% of that figure, around $10-15M. This makes the community’s expectation of a potential x50 return in the next 5 months far more plausible. Interestingly, $GOHOME displays a similar cult-like community of HODLers that is reminiscent of SPX6900. However, $GOHOME is at a much earlier stage of development, making it easier to envision significant growth compared to SPX, which already boasts a market cap of $750 million. The whitepaper outlines an ironic “roadmap” with price targets of $100 by the end of March, $1,000 by year-end, and eventually “trading higher than BTC.” This aligns perfectly with the project’s self-aware style — simultaneously embracing and satirizing the meme coin hype cycle. Their four-year token lock also appears to fit this narrative, expiring just in time for the 2029 election “when, hopefully, we are still alive and having fun.” While $TRUMP grabbed headlines and $GOHOME plays 4D chess with policy markets, PolitiFi memecoins post-irony continues to unroll at breakneck speed. ETF500 (Elon Trump Fart Price) puts a $16.5M bet on the Trump-Musk alliance that birthed the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Then there’s DUM (FreeDum Fighters), which turns partisan warfare into a game with its MAGATRON vs. Kamacop 9000 narrative. At a $7.1M market cap, it might seem like a playful take, but there’s ambition here—trading the political divide rather than individual players. In a sense, each project represents a different ill-minded approach to political capital in the degen markets era: policy ($GOHOME), power alliances (ETF500), or systemic conflict (DUM). The market will decide which thesis dominates — or perhaps reward all. Either way, the democratization of political markets is a reality; it’s just happening. You can like it or not, but still, you can play it. Or you can go home — and let other plebs trade your political future without you.

The latest burn metrics indicated that nearly 128 million SHIB was burnt over the past week. In turn, market sentiments about the dog-themed meme coin’s future outlook remain bullish, with technicals further highlighting that a potential 300% breakout looms. Can Shiba Inu Price Leverage SHIB Burn Impact? Shiba Inu price has been trading sluggishly against the backdrop of broader crypto market trends for quite a while now. The meme coin was down 2.5% to $0.00001522 as of press time, whilst its weekly and monthly losses totaled 9% and 24%, respectively. It’s noteworthy that this waning action primarily aligns with broader trends, such as macroeconomic heat over the past month and the recent Bybit hack. Nevertheless, current burn metrics underscored a significant blow to the asset’s circulating supply, sparking investor bullishness. As per Shibburn’s X post on February 22, a whopping 128.22 million coins were burnt in the last week. Per this data, the supply reduction resulted in a 120.3% uptick in the weekly SHIB burn rate. Market watchers weigh substantial optimism in light of this burn rate surge, aligning with the law of supply of supply and demand. For context, the meme coin’s burn mechanism sends tokens to a null address, thereby permanently removing them from the circulating supply by making retrieval impossible. How Much SHIB Burnt To Date? Upon further investigation, CoinGape found that 410.72 trillion Shiba Inu coins were burnt to date, which is bullish news for the leading meme coin ‘s price watchers. The circulating supply at the time of reporting was evaluated as 584.30 trillion tokens. Source: Shibburn site Meanwhile, the community registered 180.59 million tokens burnt this month (February), with approximately 90 burn transactions recorded. Besides, the previous month saw a whopping 1.16 billion tokens removed from the supply via 124 burn transactions. Altogether, the massive blow to the supply has pushed investors to be optimistic about Shiba Inu price despite its sluggish performance. Is SHIB Eyeing 300% Breakout? A recent SHIB price analysis by CoinGape Media further revealed that the meme coin could surge nearly 300% ahead amid strong market technicals. As the token sees heightened active addresses and whale activity, on-chain metrics reflect rising market optimism. Further, the asset’s MVRV ratio also aligns with bullish historical trends, entering the opportunity zone. Back then, the same scenario resulted in a 55% pump, per the analysis. However, traders and investors exercise some caution as past trends do not always guarantee future performances. Also, Shiba Inu price recently showcased signs of forming a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. Given that the crypto market recovers ahead, SHIB could take charge and lead, per the analysis. Key resistance for the token lies near $0.0000326, a sustained hold above which bolsters the path for 300% gains.

Pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 652,900 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin needs to break through resistance at the $101,000 level to have an explosive move to the upside. “We like what we see. This is why I’ve been saying to just chill. It takes a whole three daily candles to make the mood swing the other way again. To me, $99,000-$101,000 is the last resistance before new ATHs (all-time highs). Break that and we start marching upwards again.” Source: DonAlt/X The analyst also says that Bitcoin’s market structure is improving but it is still too early to turn bearish. “BTC update: looks like it was a good choice not to doom post the lows. Just took two days and BTC looks much better. Greater than $100,000 and the party starts. Until then, it’s a bit too early to celebrate the win yet.” Source: DonAlt/X The analyst also says that Bitcoin is showing strength after the negative news that the Dubai-based crypto exchange Bybit suffered a major security breach involving its Ethereum ( ETH ) cold wallet as well as Friday’s broad stock market sell-off . “Pretty good reaction to bad news especially given it’s coupled with the traditional finance markets selling off.” Bitcoin is trading for $ 96,127 at time of writing. The analyst also believes that Ethereum is trading below its fair market value, while payment token XRP has reached its market value range. “When I was bull posting XRP at $0.50-$0.60 I felt like XRP was mis-priced relative to everything else in the market Now it’s at around $3, which seems much fairer. I kinda feel the same way about ETH now at $2,800, mis-priced by quite a bit.” ETH is trading for $2,647 at time of writing, down 3.1% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, XRP is trading for $2.56 at time of writing, down 4.5% on the day.

Cynthia Lummis introduced her Bitcoin reserve bill, explicitly articulating that it is aimed to reduce U.S. debt. The new VanEck research reveals that if the act is adopted, Bitcoin may offset 18% of the national debt before the government gains the right to sell Bitcoin reserves. On Feb. 21, 2025, an investment management company VanEck released a tool indicating the potential impact of Strategic Bitcoin Reserve on U.S. debt at the specified conditions. It allows the government to set the number of bitcoins purchased by the government annually, the average price at which bitcoins are being bought in 2025, and the average compound growth rate of the BTC price and U.S. debt. The calculator tool is based on VanEck research outlining how soon the debt may be offset by the BTC reserve at the set parameters, such as the BTC price, etc. It’s worth noting that the research assumes that the Bitcoin Act introduced by Lummis is getting adopted this year without serious changes. You might also like: US Senator Lummis unveils Bitcoin reserve legislation following Trump’s keynote The research webpage contains a disclaimer that the calculations are based on past trends and don’t necessarily reflect the future Bitcoin value or the national debt amount. What can we learn from VanEck’s research? The research is based on the idea of the U.S. treasury collecting a million bitcoins in five years and holding them for 20 years. According to the act, during the 20 years, the bitcoins held in treasury could only be spent to cover the national debt. Based on VanEck research made in December 2024, the U.S. will amass one million bitcoins by 2049. The total value of these bitcoins will amount to $21 trillion and will offset around 18% of the national debt, which will reach around $116 trillion by 2029, according to VanEck. These figures will be correct at specific average compound growth rates of U.S. debt and BTC price. The VanEck researchers assume national debt will be growing by 5% per year, going from the current $36 trillion evaluation to $116 trillion in 2049. VanEck predicts that, on average, BTC value will be growing by 25% each year, increasing from nearly $100,000 to $21 billion per coin in 2049 when the federal bitcoins are no longer barred from selling. Source: VanEck The government may amass more than one million bitcoins as it may accumulate additional coins through seizing, donations, and other ways. All in all, VanEck research indicates that Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will hardly pay off U.S. debt anytime soon which is in line with what Lummis claimed in July 2024 when she was talking about reducing the debt, not covering it. To fully pay off the national debt (if the growth rates are correct), the government will need to purchase over five million bitcoins. Could Bitcoin ever pay off U.S. debt completely? In August of 2024, in an interview broadcast on Fox, Donald Trump assumed that Bitcoin would probably pay off trillions of U.S. debt. JUST IN: 🇺🇸 Donald Trump says ""maybe we'll pay off our $35 trillion debt by handing them a little crypto check, handing them a little #Bitcoin ."" pic.twitter.com/V5WlYiAQw0 — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) August 2, 2024 Even if we don’t factor in potential debt growth (according to the Congressional Budget Office, debt may reach around $50 trillion by 2035), the U.S. government will need 36 million bitcoins at $1,000,000 (the evaluation often named by various Bitcoin enthusiasts as the near future Bitcoin price). The problem is that such an amount of bitcoins is impossible to get as the maximum supply of Bitcoin is set at only 21 million, and its pre-programmed scarcity is seen as one of the main drivers of its value. The company holding the biggest BTC bag is BlackRock. As of February 2025, it owns over half of a million bitcoins. Another avid bitcoinist, Strategy’s Michael Saylor, claimed that “there’s only room for one nation-state to buy up 20% of the Bitcoin network.” Note that he is not even considering a third part of the supply for any nation while he owns around half a million bitcoins. 🇺🇸 SAYLOR: “There’s only room for one nation-state to buy up 20% of the #Bitcoin network, and obviously, I think it should be the United States.” pic.twitter.com/dbNNbJNULg — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) February 21, 2025 Amassing even one million bitcoins is a hassle–no wonder a strong Bitcoin proponent Sen. Lummis gives the U.S. government five years to complete the task of accumulating one million BTC. The BTC price must reach $36 billion by 2030 so that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve can be used to cover U.S. debt (however, most probably, the debt value will grow by that time). Even the most bullish predictions are not bullish enough to claim something like that. Another problem is that exchanging these bitcoins for cash won’t be an easy task, as the U.S. will need to find enough buyers. The dumping of this huge amount will affect the price negatively, discounting the remaining reserves. In general, it’s safe to say Bitcoin may be seen as a partial solution while Trump’s words about Bitcoin paying off U.S. debt are pretty baseless at the current stage.

The Blockchain sector maintains growth but multiple fields experience decreased momentum in their development. From the beginning of 2025 until now, investors have lost billions of dollars from Meme coins, Real World Asset projects and AI-driven tokens. The XRP and XLM payment giants maintain leadership of their sector, which has witnessed significant growth this year with Remittix collecting more than $12.6M. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Presale Stuck in the Past Rexas Finance (RXS) a few months ago did create quite a buzz by promising something innovative in DeFi solutions. However, the market conditions for DeFi have made it less attractive for investors as funds continue to drain from speculative projects. RXS stands in stark contrast to Remittix because Remittix thrives on payment growth. Without a clear real-world solution for RXS, one may characterize it merely as a DeFi experiment with its very survival now under serious threat. A lingering sourness among investors is due to the failure of DeFi projects to gain mass adoption in the past. If things go wrong, RXS might find itself in the same boat, having neither reputable institutional backing nor any solid regulatory compliance strategy. The level of complexity and risk in the DeFi ecosystem alienates normal crypto users from finance and real estate issues. Here lies an opportunity for Remittix. Lightchain AI (LCAI): Hype-Driven, But Lacking Real Utility Lightchain AI (LCAI) moved into the spotlight with a new hybridization of AI and blockchain, promising an AI-powered Proof-of-Intelligence consensus mechanism. Yet, AI coins are bleeding billions in value as investors understand that AI-based blockchains are unemphatic and speculative still. While LCAI is still searching for practical applications, Remittix, on the other hand, has begun integrating itself into international finance to solve real problems through crypto-to-FIAT transactions. The hype around AI-driven blockchain technologies has waned in the last couple of months as many projects tend to offer very few real-world cases. Investors wonder if AI blockchains can significantly improve efficiency over non-AI blockchains or if they are simply a re-wrap of technology already available in the market. No partnerships with major institutions have promised to make Lightchain AI mature in the long run, still in its starting phase. Solaxy (SOLX): A Mystery Wrapped in Uncertainty Solaxy (SOLX) has been working on the RWA tokenization wave for some time; however, this niche seems attractive, whereas real-life results have faced restlessness due to regulatory uncertainties. Billions of dollars have fled RWA tokens, leaving Solaxy lacking investor confidence and transparency. Remittix, on the opposite side of the spectrum, is prospering as the payment model does not rest on speculation; that is how the growing problem in finance gets cured. Regulatory scrutiny has made mass adoption of Real World Asset tokens increasingly difficult. Governments across the globe are cracking down on projects that want to tokenize real estate, commodities and other assets without compliance with the law. Thus far, this has left projects like SOLX uncertain, never knowing where they stand legally. Remittix is Redefining the Crypto Payments Landscape Remittix, unlike other competition, has a payment story like that of XRP and XLM, which has made great gains in 2025. Connecting with amazing users, Remittix now allows crypto to FIAT conversion direct deposit into banks, thus eliminating the greater rub of global crypto payments. Currently selling at $0.0628, Remittix’s uniqueness is that it renders on-the-spot value to users without depending on future price increases to sustain themselves. Investors see that solutions like Remittix will make more headway in increasing utility-and-adoption-focused markets. The ability to send internationally without foreign remittance charges and on the same day transaction processing fundamentally marks Remittix as a giant in financial efficiency. The brightness of the Remittix model is evidenced by over $12.7 million raised so far into the project beyond its competition level. Unlike RXS, LCAI and SOLX, present in concept, Remittix is real. Final Thoughts: Why Investors Are Choosing Remittix Over RXS, LCAI, and SOLX The cryptocurrency market shows Remittix (RTX) is demonstrating that practical applications succeed better than Meme coins, AI tokens and RWA projects during 2025. The decrease in DeFi activity challenges Rexas Finance. At the same time, Lightchain AI experiences the downfall of AI tokens and Solaxy encounters regulatory obstacles. Still, Remittix presents a solution for worldwide financial needs and maintains a specified business pathway.
