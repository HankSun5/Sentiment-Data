Here’s the Estimated Wealth of CZ After the Latest Surge,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bnb-breaks-another-record-heres-the-estimated-wealth-of-cz-after-the-latest-surge/,"A remarkable development has occurred in the cryptocurrency market. According to 8market data, the market value of Binance's native coin, BNB, has reached $141.79 billion. This figure moved BNB to 155th place in the global asset market capitalization rankings, surpassing Intel with a market capitalization of $138.14 billion. According to a June 2024 report by Forbes, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) held approximately 89.1 million BNB at the time. The recent surge in the BNB price, reaching over $1,020, has brought the value of CZ's holdings to approximately $90.88 billion. Related News: Has the Altcoin Season Begun? Here's the Latest Status According to the Index CZ's other known crypto asset portfolio is as follows: SHORT: 3.996 trillion units ($115.68 million) BNB: 958,841 units ($979.33 thousand) SIREN: 1.775 million units ($173.56 thousand) QUQ: 84.934 million units ($144.58 thousand) JANITOR: 50 million units ($80.76 thousand) However, of the cryptocurrencies listed above, only BNB is an asset Zhao willingly owns. The others are memecoins sent by developers to draw attention to CZ.

According to CoinGlass data, a total of $7.93 million worth of XRP positions were liquidated. $7.21 million of this came from long positions and $718,000 from short positions. This brought the daily liquidation imbalance to a record 903%. The XRP price fell from $3.04 to $2.98 during the day, falling below the critical $3 psychological support level. While the $2.90 level is currently being held as support, the market is showing no signs of a strong recovery. The sharp decline was not limited to XRP alone. On the Ethereum (ETH) side, a total of $61.5 million worth of long positions were liquidated, while short losses were limited to $4.14 million. A similar picture was seen for Bitcoin (BTC): $35.1 million was liquidated, $33.1 million of which came from long positions. The higher liquidation rate for long positions compared to short positions may indicate a weakening of buyer appetite in the market. Some analysts suggest that the decline may be due to strategic price pressure from institutional investors rather than a simple correction. Black Swan Capitalist founder Versan Aljarrah and financial writer Jim Willie argue that institutions are holding back the rally to accumulate XRP at its low price. “If it weren’t for these pressures, XRP could have risen to at least $7-$8 from its recent price movements,” Willie said, adding that institutions see XRP as a liquidity tool instead of the US dollar and take long-term positions. *This is not investment advice.

The SHIB coin is starting to gain notice as it appears on Coinbase’s radar. Coinbase already offers a futures product for Shiba Inu, and this step positions the meme coin for consideration as a future ETF. SHIB’s marketing lead claims the coin already has the necessary setup for this, while a market analyst predicts significant price growth. Both agree that momentum for SHIB is picking up now. Related Reading: From $2 Trillion To $400T? CEO Sees Bitcoin Exploding 200x – Here’s More Shiba Inu Enters Coinbase’s ETF Watchlist According to SHIB’s marketing lead, Susie S, the coin has now joined Coinbase’s “ETF Watchlist Club.” This group already includes Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Hedera (HBAR), and XRP. Being named in this group indicates that the Shiba Inu token is gaining more serious attention. Susie S explained that Shiba Inu is in line for spot ETF consideration because Coinbase already has a regulated futures contract called the “1K SHIB Index.” It is essential because it puts SHIB on the same pathway that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) followed before they gained approval for spot ETFs. For the first time, the meme coin now stands in the same conversation as two of the world’s largest cryptocurrencies. She added that while it may be harder for Shiba Inu to launch its own solo ETF immediately, the ETF could be part of a larger product. That product could be something like a “Top 10 Crypto ETF” that bundles together several coins. Market Analyst Sees Massive Potential For SHIB Price Market analyst Heber Mayen also sees a big future for Shiba Inu. Posting a SHIB price chart on X, he stated, “It’s gonna be massive!” His comment reflects the rising attention around Shiba Inu as it becomes more active in trading markets. Mayen explained that SHIB’s popularity on Coinbase’s perpetual markets is a significant indicator. As more traders buy and sell SHIB in these products, the trading volume goes up. This rise in volume can help SHIB meet one of the needs for an ETF to be approved. In other words, the more people trade Shiba Inu now, the stronger the case becomes for a future ETF. Related Reading: FalconX Moves 413K Solana Worth $98M – Impact On SOL Price Currently, Shiba Inu is attracting more leveraged traders, and this ETF activity may be fueling ongoing speculation. Analysts like Mayen argue that momentum is on SHIB’s side as investors seek the next big crypto ETF candidate. The price action and volume activity together create the type of market story that can push Shiba Inu further into the spotlight. Backed by comments from its marketing lead and bullish words from the analyst, the SHIB meme coin could become the next big thing.

What is notable in this rush is the kind of capital that is coming in. Investors with blue-chip assets in their portfolios, such as Cardano (ADA) and Chainlink (LINK), are now pouring money into this new token. The acquisition is an indicator of a changing approach since whales and industry veterans are combining proven projects with new ventures, with more probable upward progress. This is a relevant trend that indicates an increased awareness of the continuously changing market in 2025. ADA and LINK remain large-cap assets that have merged reliability and technological leadership, but their big valuations inherently slow down the exponential growth of their prices. Conversely, presales such as MAGACOIN FINANCE offer the chance to buy at lower prices and wait for exponential gains when liquidity and exchange listings happen. The appeal lies in timing, risk-versus-reward, and the potential for outsized gains that established assets can no longer deliver. Established giants: Cardano and Chainlink hold their ground Cardano is among the most well-known sources of smart contracts, with support for sustainability and security. Their proof-of-stake design has placed it among energy efficiency leaders, and its scaling solutions, named Hydra and rising DeFi partnerships, are expanding its usefulness. To its persistent supporters, ADA stands as a home for technological progress and usage. However, its maturity curbs the hyper-growth that it experienced in earlier years, which then makes some holders venture into more speculative players. On the other hand, Chainlink controls the decentralized oracle space. It has linked blockchains to real-world data, making it essential to decentralized finance, gaming, and Enterprise adoption. New alliances in tokenized assets and integrations on a broader scale shed more light on the continued relevance of LINK. Nonetheless, its billion-dollar market capitalization has ensured that its growth curve is more incremental than exponential. This fact has prompted investors to look beyond its gradual trend to the newer tokens that may repeat the initial success of earlier cycles. The appeal of MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale MAGACOIN FINANCE positions itself as a high-upside, low-cap opportunity that contrasts sharply with the size and stability of ADA and LINK. In presale, investors acquire tokens at entry points designed to reward early adoption. These discounted levels, combined with scarcity-focused tokenomics, give buyers a chance to benefit from appreciation once listings and liquidity expand. The project’s roadmap also plays into its appeal. With planned features in decentralized finance and community governance, MAGACOIN FINANCE seeks to carve out a distinct niche. Whales have taken note of this structure, seeing it as an opportunity to complement their blue-chip holdings with a token that carries higher potential return. The more than $14 million raised so far underscores this confidence. Portfolio diversification in 2025 The influx of ADA and LINK investors into MAGACOIN FINANCE indicates a bigger tendency among portfolio tactics. Blue-chip cryptos are stable, whereas presales generate momentum and new growth opportunities. The combination of the two will form a balanced strategy that is consistent with the realities of the present market. Investors are no longer deciding between safety and opportunity, but rather merging them to ensure optimization. This diversification plan indicates the extent to which the market has evolved. Earlier cycles had concentrated much of the capital on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a few other leading projects. Capital allocation today is increasingly dynamic with institutional adoption, real-world asset tokenization, and the rapid emergence of new platforms. The presale success experienced by MAGACOIN FINANCE underscores the fact that established investors are also prepared to commit to a start-up project when growth opportunities outweigh risks. Conclusion The presale milestone reached by MAGACOIN FINANCE demonstrates the evolving strategies shaping crypto portfolios in 2025. Cardano and Chainlink remain indispensable to the blockchain ecosystem, but their growth curves are steady rather than explosive. By contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers investors an early-entry advantage that may translate into higher returns once listings and liquidity arrive. For whales and retail backers alike, this balance between proven networks and presale opportunities is becoming a defining feature of the next phase in crypto investing.

This could be the beginning of a new tech stack - one in which AI, not humans, becomes the primary developer of applications, according to Dominic Williams, founder of Internet Computer developer Dfinity. Williams argued that while crypto prices remain driven largely by market mechanics - treasury operations, liquidity games and speculation - the underlying technology will eventually force a reckoning in an interview with CoinDesk. “In the long run, markets begin to reflect realities on the ground,” he said. “But as yet you’re not seeing what’s happening with Internet Computer reflected in ICP’s price.” Running AI on-Chain The Internet Computer first demonstrated neural networks running as smart contracts in April last year, starting with image classification and later facial recognition, Williams said. While those were relatively simple models compared to large language models - the kind that power AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini - they were proof of concept: that AI can run natively on a blockchain. No other network has achieved this, Williams pointed out, despite the chatter about “decentralized AI.” Where others rely on off-chain infrastructure like Amazon Web Services, ICP seeks to integrate the full AI development and execution stack on-chain. Williams describes this as “a self-writing internet” - a system where users describe what they want, and an AI delivers it as a working application, hosted directly on Internet Computer. The bigger idea, Williams said, is that AI itself will replace much of today’s developer workflow. Instead of humans writing code, configuring databases and maintaining servers, an AI could spin up applications instantly, update them continuously and ensure resilience through blockchain-based guarantees. This reframes the blockchain not just as a settlement layer for tokens, but as the optimal environment for AI-generated applications. ICP’s design, with features like “reverse gas” - the model where developers pay for the computational costs of their applications, rather than requiring end users to pay a transaction fee - removes the need for firewalls or database migrations that plague traditional infrastructure. “AI is developing these apps hundreds of times faster than humans could,” Williams said. “And because there are no system admins standing by, you need the guardrails only blockchain can provide.” Williams pointed to early hackathons where ordinary people used AI on ICP to build apps: from a crowdsourced pothole-mapping platform, to a tool for generating wills and health directives. The vision is that such tools could proliferate in the millions. Entrepreneurs, small businesses and even NGOs could create customized apps without technical expertise, paying for usage with fiat while crypto tokens underpin the system behind the scenes. Price Action Still Lagging Despite these developments, the ICP token has yet to see sustained momentum. It briefly rallied when AI integrations were announced last year, but has since traded more in line with broader market sentiment than with user adoption. Williams accepts this disconnect but predicts that markets may catch up very soon. “This could be the first time Web3 actually outcompetes Web2 technologically, without a token incentive in sight,” Williams said. “The shock will be when people realize they can just talk to an AI, and a blockchain app appears at a URL.”",Tech|Internet Computer|AI|News,EN,0,0,MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|ICP|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-20 21:00:00

He detailed how the group is using increasingly sophisticated tactics to gain access to companies. Operatives Are Exploiting Hiring Process CZ shared his concerns via a September 18 X post, describing the hackers as “advanced, creative, and patient.” He explained how the most common method used by these individuals involves posing as job candidates to secure roles in companies, particularly in developer, security, and finance positions, giving them a “foot in the door.” In other cases, the group poses as employers and attempts to interview staff, using the process to distribute malware. Zhao noted that during these sessions, the attackers often claim there is a problem with Zoom and then send a link to an “update” carrying a virus, or they provide coding questions followed by “sample code” embedded with malware. Another tactic involves pretending to be users who file customer support requests containing malicious links. CZ added that hackers also pay or bribe employees and hired vendors to gain access to data, pointing to a recent case in India where an outsourcing service was compromised, resulting in the leak of data from a major U.S. exchange and losses exceeding $400 million. This alert follows the release of a report by cybersecurity group Security Alliance (SEAL), profiling over 60 impostors linked to North Korean operations. The report says that these attackers built fake LinkedIn profiles, set up GitHub portfolios, and used forged government IDs to make their applications look real. Shift in Methods North Korean hackers have always been a major threat in the crypto industry, with over $1.3 billion worth of assets stolen in 2024 alone. Traditionally, they have relied on phishing, malware, and private key compromises to loot from exchanges. However, recent reports suggest they are moving towards targeting human resources. A separate investigation by ZachXBT also uncovered how a small DPRK team of five IT workers operated over 30 fake identities at crypto firms. Elsewhere, Coinbase also recently reported a similar threat from these bad actors. The exchange shared that they are increasingly targeting their remote worker policy to infiltrate sensitive systems. CEO Brian Armstrong has since announced changes to the company’s internal security protocols, including mandatory in-person onboarding in the U.S., fingerprinting, and U.S. citizenship requirements for employees with system-level access. The exchange also introduced stricter interview procedures, such as requiring cameras to remain on, to prevent impersonation and AI-assisted coaching. In light of the growing threat to the job market, CZ has urged crypto platforms to train their employees not to download files and to screen potential candidates carefully.

For a lot of newer players, this progress seems absolutely impossible to achieve. Which is why copy trading has become so big: It lets beginners mimic the orders of professional traders, allowing them to benefit from and even learn from their expertise without having to spend years honing it. For beginners, copy trading is changing the game in how consumers participate in the market, but it’s not the only path to potential growth. For presale options, demand is also skyrocketing. And through them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has stood out most and attracted whales as well as early retail investors. Understanding the Appeal of Copy Trading The fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading can mean that charts change dramatically from one minute to the next, and news items that ignite a “fear of missing out” among ordinary investors one day can send prices plunging the other way overnight. For a lot of newer players, this progress seems absolutely impossible to achieve. Which is why copy trading has become so big: It lets beginners mimic the orders of professional traders, allowing them to benefit from and even learn from their expertise without having to spend years honing it. For beginners, copy trading is changing the game in how consumers participate in the market, but it’s not the only path to potential growth. For presale options, demand is also skyrocketing. And through them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has stood out most and attracted whales as well as early retail investors. At its most basic level, copy trading is simple. An investor chooses a trader whose trading record they’d like to mimic publicly, connects their account through a copy trading platform and their account will then automatically replicate all the trades of that professional. If the trader is buying Bitcoin, the investor’s account buys Bitcoin. The trader gets profits, and so does the investor. This configuration allows those new to the market the opportunity to take advantage of professional strategies without learning technical analysis overnight. That is particularly true in crypto, where volatility breeds caution even among the most experienced traders. Beginners can have more confidence in assuming trades that they’d otherwise shy away from by replicating someone who already has experience. Benefits That Attract Newcomers One of the most significant advantages of copy trading is that it allows learning through participation. Watching trades unfold in real time helps beginners understand why certain moves are made, what patterns traders look for, and how risk is managed. Over time, this exposure can help newcomers develop their own style. Another benefit is time. Many beginners don’t have the hours each day to study charts, read research, or track every news update. Copy trading lets them participate in the market passively while still learning on the side. There’s also the potential to generate consistent results if the chosen trader has a reliable record. While there are no guarantees, aligning with a skilled strategist gives beginners a better chance than guessing on their own. The Risks That Must Be Managed Despite the appeal, copy trading carries real risks. The most obvious is over-reliance. Just because a trader has performed well in the past doesn’t mean they will continue to do so indefinitely. Market conditions change, and even professionals face drawdowns. There are also platform fees, performance charges, and the issue of slippage—when large numbers of people copy the same trader, execution prices can differ. This means returns may not precisely match those of the lead trader. Finally, beginners may find themselves copying strategies that involve risk levels far beyond their comfort zone. Some traders thrive on high leverage, which can lead to big wins but also wipeouts. Without caution, following the wrong profile can cause losses just as quickly as gains. An Alternative for Beginners While many newcomers are exploring copy trading, others are turning their attention to early presales as an alternative route into the market. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the names dominating the discussion. Forecasts suggest it could deliver up to 22,000% ROI by 2025, putting it in the spotlight as a potential breakout candidate for the next bull cycle. The presale is attracting both whale inflows and retail demand, with investors eager to secure allocations before wider listings. Adding to the urgency, early buyers can unlock a 50% EXTRA BONUS with the code PATRIOT50X, effectively boosting their positions. With phases selling out quickly, this presale highlights the other side of beginner strategy—where instead of copying someone else’s trades, investors position themselves early in projects with high growth potential. How To Use Copy Trading Wisely For those who do choose copy trading, discipline is essential. Beginners should avoid putting all their capital into a single trader. Spreading allocations across several different profiles reduces the risk of one poor performance wiping out an account. Monitoring results regularly is also essential. If a trader suddenly changes strategies or starts chasing risky bets, it may be time to reduce exposure. Having personal stop-loss settings in place adds another layer of control, ensuring losses don’t spiral out of hand. Ultimately, copy trading works best as part of a broader strategy. Beginners can combine it with long-term holdings in established assets, small positions in promising presales, and gradual self-education. Over time, many investors evolve from pure copy trading into building their own independent strategies. Conclusion Copy trading has given beginners a way to step into crypto without feeling overwhelmed, offering the chance to profit while learning from experienced traders. But like any tool, it comes with risks that require careful management. Presale opportunities such as MAGACOIN FINANCE provide another powerful option, letting investors capture upside by entering early before the broader market catches on. For new participants in crypto, the key is balance: combining education, security, and disciplined allocation to find a strategy that fits both goals and risk tolerance.

These assets are held by ETFs, public companies, governments, private companies, exchanges, and DeFi protocols. ETFs and public companies, in particular, make up the largest portion of the total. Related News: Two Whales Dumped This Altcoin: Sold in Bulk According to the data, 332 institutions currently hold Bitcoin reserves, including 192 public companies, 44 ETFs or funds, 68 private companies, 13 governments, 11 DeFi protocols, and 4 exchanges/custodians. After accounting for the ~1.1 million BTC held by Satoshi Nakamoto and the 2.3–3.7 million BTC thought to be missing, the 3.74 million BTC held by institutions equates to approximately 22.6%–24.7% of the available supply. The country with the largest Bitcoin holdings is the US (118), followed by Canada (43), the UK (21), Japan (12), and Hong Kong (12). The amount of Bitcoin held by institutions has increased significantly, particularly after the approval of cryptocurrency-holding ETFs in the US and the rise in the number of digital asset treasury companies. *This is not investment advice.

52029718,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=813933,1758404857,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52029718.jpeg,Wall Street has gained $16 trillion this year despite global wars and political instability,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wall-streets-16-trillion-rally-powers-on/,"Wall Street has gained over $16 trillion in market value this year, even as the rest of the world looks like a war room. That rally has come while expected volatility in US stocks is sitting near one-year lows, and people keep throwing money at crypto, meme stocks, and anything that looks like it might pump. Oil prices are hovering near the cheapest levels seen in four years, and nobody seems to care that multiple wars are boiling around the globe. According to Bloomberg, Russia has flown drones into NATO airspace, Israel is deep into its assault on Gaza, and China keeps circling Taiwan’s coastline. Ukraine is still under siege, Japan’s government is barely standing, and France is dealing with yet another crisis. Donald Trump, back in the White House, is already swinging tariffs at everyone. He’s leading a messy trade war against allies and rivals with zero concern for who’s next. But none of that has broken the mood on Wall Street. Investors are still pouring in, eyes locked on profits instead of politics. Markets ride on earnings while ignoring bombs The general investor rule right now is this: if the geopolitical chaos doesn’t hit numbers, it doesn’t exist. That’s how Helen Jewell, chief investment officer of EMEA fundamental equities at BlackRock, framed it. “We’re very focused on geopolitical risks,” she said, “but as an investor you’ve got to look at how you can quantify that. It is the implication on consumers and currency because they are the things that impact company earnings.” So far, the impact hasn’t come. US corporate earnings are still solid. There’s no recession, and the Fed’s latest interest-rate cut has only boosted the mood. But it wouldn’t take much for that to flip. If oil prices suddenly spike, or if a major nation’s bonds collapse, the whole rally could fall apart. That’s what happened in 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine and crude prices exploded. Wall Street dropped fast. France and Japan are also looking shaky. Their governments are weak, and their bond markets are vulnerable. That could hurt broader equity indexes if something breaks. But for now, investors are pretending those problems are far away. Guillaume Jaisson, strategist at Goldman Sachs, said flat out: “Little has been priced into stocks on geopolitical risks.” He warned that US stocks are very expensive, and Europe’s not cheap either. Political chaos already hits global stocks Trump’s policy moves are already leaving bruises. In April, he floated the highest tariffs in a century, questioned the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency, and triggered a selloff in Treasuries. The S&P 500 dropped nearly 20% from its high. It wasn’t just talk — investors ran for cover, and fast. Other countries haven’t been spared. The CAC 40 in France dropped over 3% in just two days after Francois Bayrou called for a vote of confidence over a budget fight. Foreign investors pulled $473 million from Indonesia’s stock market this month after violent protests and a surprise replacement of the finance minister. In Japan, investors got spooked again after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced he’d step down. These dips haven’t lasted long, though. Traders keep betting that central banks and governments will step in to stop serious damage. But Jaisson warned that if there’s a rise in uncertainty, markets could flip from treating bad news as good news to just bad news being bad. With valuations already stretched, there’s almost no room to mess up. Viktor Shvets, global strategist at Macquarie, said investors still don’t know how to react to global conflict. “Equity investors are hopeless about geopolitics; since the Vietnam War, it hasn’t had an impact,” he said. Instead of worrying about wars, they focus on things they can measure: profits, household spending, and currency movements. Still, the fallout is real. Since French President Emmanuel Macron called a snap election in June 2024, the CAC 40 has lagged behind global peers, missing out on gains fueled by AI hype and economic growth elsewhere. The FTSE 100 in the UK has also underperformed in dollar terms ever since the Brexit referendum in 2016. Now, more investors are getting nervous. A Bank of America survey showed that geopolitical risk is now rated the highest since last December in fund managers’ risk rankings. That fear is showing up in the market. A UBS basket of defense-linked stocks is up over 100% this year, and gold is hitting record highs, though that’s also because the dollar is slipping. But the real risk is still out there. Tim Murray, capital markets strategist at T. Rowe Price, warned that if these conflicts actually hit the real economy, stocks could crash hard. “A big negative economic surprise, be it politically driven or not, could mean a much bigger selloff than normal given the current valuations,” he said.

Meanwhile, more and more investors are considering Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Now available in presale for a meager $0.035, MUTM is catching the eye with its DeFi-focused lending and borrowing protocol, designed with real-world use case in mind. While ADA investors get ready for volatility, MUTM holders are watching for a potential 44x run, making it one of the hottest tokens of the next cycle. Cardano Sees Market Volatility as Investors Keep Tabs on Progress Cardano (ADA) is currently at $0.9148. The token has experienced slight movements amid widespread market fluctuation, and the performance of the price in the future hinges on network activity, technological advancement, as well as investor attitude. ADA enjoys a friendly community and regular updates, but professionals caution that it could retrace as market attitude becomes negative. In the meantime, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining attention for its innovative DeFi protocol, offering an alternative path to expansion compared to ADA. Mutuum Finance is giving investors the type of early-stage appreciation that ADA investors can never experience again. With capital seeking the next behemoth to lift off, Mutuum Finance is becoming the coin to keep an eye on. Mutuum Finance Presale FOMO Mutuum Finance provides investors the opportunity to be among the first to adopt the project and invest in tokens at much lower prices than what they will be required to pay once the project has been launched. At presale Phase 6, priced at $0.035 per MUTM, the token will be sold at Phase 7 at $0.04. Presale has been successful with over $16.01 million raised and over 16,410 token holders, a sign of positive investor sentiment and confidence in the market. As another layer of security, Mutuum Finance has introduced an official Bug Bounty Program in conjunction with CertiK that assures up to $50,000 USDT in rewards. Available to everyone, the program invites white-hat hackers, developers, and researchers to scan the codebase for any potential flaws. The rewards are tiered according to severity level, so even the low-level bugs get addressed before release. The move is just one sign of Mutuum’s commitment to investor protection, transparency, and trust. MUTM is a two-layer hybrid lending protocol, with Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models, to ensure ultimate flexibility. The P2C model is used to enable the contracts to monitor the market round-the-clock so that interest rates can be decided. It is designed such that investors will earn passive income and lenders will lend at the lowest interest rates and the contracts will execute the transaction automatically. The P2P model enables direct real-time interaction between lenders and borrowers without an intermediary. The more dynamic of the two enables riskier products such as meme coins and offers freedom and efficiency in a trustless setting. For providing timely and accurate prices, Mutuum Finance utilizes Chainlink oracles that aggregate rates of high-cap tokens such as USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, combined feeds, and on-chain data feeds are also utilized for providing security in a volatile market. The robust pricing foundation is utilized in stable collateral management, liquidations, and risk analysis for guaranteeing the stability and efficiency of the protocol under any condition. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a growth-altcoin in DeFi and Cardano (ADA) looms over market volatility. Phase 6 presale tokens cost $0.035, before rising to $0.04 in Phase 7. The project has already reached $16.01M raised and 16,410+ token holders, showcasing strong market trust. With a $50K CertiK bug bounty, a P2C/P2P lending protocol, and Chainlink-based oracle pricing, MUTM provides security, agility, and scalable DeFi infrastructure.

Notably, the premier cryptocurrency continues to trade within the $115,000 price region after earlier price gains on Thursday were followed by a correction of equal measure. SOPR Ratio Trends Up: Market Signals Point To New Bitcoin Rally In a QuickTake post on September 19, PelinayPA shares some potential insights into Bitcoin’s future trajectory based on the latest Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) developments. For context, the SOPR is an on-chain metric that reflects whether Bitcoin investors are selling their coins at a profit or a loss. However, this metric can also be used to gauge the balance of profitability between long-term holders and short-term holders when we compare the SOPR Ratios of both parties, i.e, LTH/STH SOPR. When the ratio is high (LTH > STH), it indicates that seasoned investors are more profitable, often signaling the beginning or continuation of a sustainable bull market. Conversely, when the ratio is low (LTH In the present market, the LTH/STH SOPR ratio is balanced but moving upward, a sign that long-term holders are regaining their advantage. PelinayPA suggests this could mark the early stages of a new bull cycle, with indicators pointing to $120,000 as the next major upside technical target. Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Remains High In other news, US-based institutions and whales continue to accumulate substantial levels of Bitcoin regardless of price movements. Market analyst Darkfost reports that Coinbase Premium has turned consistently positive since April, reflecting stronger institutional demand from US traders compared to entities on other trading platforms, such as Binance.

The Commerce Ministry released a statement saying Beijing’s stance had not changed. “China’s position on TikTok is clear: The Chinese government respects the wishes of the enterprise, and welcomes it to carry out commercial negotiations in accordance with market rules to reach a solution compliant with China’s laws and regulations, and strikes a balance of interests,” the ministry said. The comments come after Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by phone on Friday. The outcome of the discussions is seen as important not just for TikTok but also for broader trade talks. The short video app has 170 million users in the U.S., and its fate is linked to potential compromises in other areas such as agriculture and aviation, as the world’s two largest economies seek to move beyond their tariff standoff. The Commerce Ministry urged Washington to match China’s efforts “It is hoped that the U.S. side will work towards the same goal as China, earnestly fulfil its corresponding commitments, and provide an open, fair, equitable and non-discriminatory business environment for the continued operation of Chinese enterprises in the U.S., including TikTok ,” the statement said. Earlier in the week, officials from both nations reached a framework agreement during meetings in Madrid. Chinese state media described the outcome as a “win-win,” while pledging to review TikTok’s technology exports and licensing of intellectual property. That arrangement cleared one of the hurdles set by U.S. lawmakers. Congress had mandated that TikTok be blocked in the United States by January 2025 unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, divested its American operations. Trump extended the divestiture deadline until December 16. He Yadong, a spokesperson for the Commerce Ministry, repeated Beijing’s call for the U.S. to lower barriers for Chinese companies when asked about what China had gained from the Madrid talks. A new deal would put Americans in control of TikTok According to the White House , the new deal will give Americans the majority stake in TikTok’s U.S. operations. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News on Saturday that six of the seven seats on TikTok’s board would go to American representatives, and the platform’s algorithm would also be controlled in the United States. “The final deal will be signed in the coming days,” Leavitt said. She noted that American appointees to the board would have experience in national security and cybersecurity. ByteDance, which will select the remaining board member, will not have access to the security committee. Talks in Madrid earlier in the week, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, produced the outline of this agreement. Details have not been made public. Trump and Xi gave their approval during their phone call on Friday. Under the plan, ByteDance will keep less than a 20 percent stake in TikTok. New investors will include Oracle Corp., venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, and Silver Lake Management LLC, a private equity firm, a senior White House official said. Oracle will serve as TikTok’s security partner to make sure the app meets U.S. standards. The official explained that data from American users will be stored in the U.S. and kept out of reach of Chinese authorities. Leavitt stressed that most of the conditions had already been set. “So all of those details have already been agreed upon, now we just need this deal to be signed and that will be happening, I anticipate, in the coming days,” she said.

This massive jump was reported by Forge Global, a firm that tracks private market investments. Three years after Sam Altman dropped ChatGPT into the world, this is where things stand. Altogether, the seven companies have multiplied their value four times over since late 2022, which was when ChatGPT hit the market and everything changed. Forge’s figures are built from actual private trading, funding rounds, and investor tender offers, not guesses. And this number isn’t slowing down. Elon Musk’s xAI is raising $10 billion at a $200 billion valuation, up from $150 billion just a few months ago. The demand for anything AI-related is still insane. It’s not just pumping the public market, where names like Oracle, Broadcom, and Nvidia are flying—it’s setting off an arms race in the private world too. AI pushes OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI into the top tier Forge says OpenAI is sitting at $324 billion, the highest of the pack. Right behind is Anthropic at $178 billion, and then xAI with $90 billion. Those three are all chasing the same thing, big AI language models, and they’re fighting not just each other but also Google and Meta. They’re still private companies, but their influence is public as hell. Databricks is also on the list, now valued at $100 billion. That’s thanks to the company’s AI-first push in data analytics. Musk’s other giant, SpaceX, has ballooned to $456 billion, making it the second-biggest name after OpenAI. Stripe holds a $92 billion tag, and defense tech startup Anduril rounds it out with $53 billion. That last one is moving so much money into military-grade AI that Forge had to create a new defense investment fund just to keep up. AI capital flood keeps firms private and disrupts public trading Forge CEO Kelly Rodriques told reporters this isn’t a bubble of hot air. “We’ve not seen this in the private market ever,” he said. “Companies that are growing at 100%, 200%, 300% on numbers that are already pretty big.” He’s not alone in that view. Forge also tracked that 19 AI companies have pulled in $65 billion so far in 2025, making up 77% of all private-market capital. With that kind of cash, none of these players need to go public anytime soon. Rodriques added, “If these stocks are liquid and have access to as much capital as they can get, regulation is probably the only thing stopping them from staying private for as long as they want.” Still, the effect on public markets is obvious. Oracle’s stock shot up 36% in one day after reporting a huge deal with OpenAI. Broadcom also signed its own massive agreement with Sam’s team. Microsoft’s bet on OpenAI keeps paying off. Google, Meta, Amazon—they’ve all jacked up their infrastructure spending plans to handle what’s coming. Sam isn’t blind to how wild it’s gotten. At a private dinner with reporters in San Francisco, he called the valuations “insane” and straight-up admitted, “we are in a bubble.” But that didn’t stop him from revealing OpenAI’s next play. “You should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on datacenter construction,” he said. “We will spend maybe more aggressively than any company who’s ever spent on anything… because we just have this very deep belief in what we’re seeing.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",Tech|SpaceX|Tesla,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-20 22:10:13

As analysts debate whether this momentum could soon carry the token toward fresh all-time highs, some investors are already looking elsewhere for opportunities with even greater upside. One name being discussed in presale circles is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has quickly gained traction as a potential outperformer heading into 2025. Institutional Demand Builds Around XRP In recent months, XRP has gained strong backing from institutions diversifying their crypto holdings. Companies are no longer focused solely on Bitcoin; instead, they are building baskets of assets that include XRP, Ethereum, and other major tokens. This marks a significant shift in strategy, where treasuries are being treated more like balanced portfolios than single-asset bets. One high-profile example came when Amber International Holdings revealed a $100 million plan to build a diversified digital asset reserve, including a sizable XRP allocation. Market observers say this type of adoption underscores growing confidence in XRP’s role as a settlement and liquidity tool for global payments. Price Targets and Market Outlook The question now is how far XRP can go in the short term. Technical analysts point out that the $3 level has been a key resistance point, and breaking it decisively could pave the way toward $3.50 or even $4 in the coming months. Bullish momentum has been supported by rising trading volume, growing open interest in futures contracts, and steady inflows into XRP-focused investment products. On the other hand, skeptics warn that XRP has historically struggled to sustain rallies once euphoria builds. Regulatory clarity has improved, but lingering uncertainty around how various jurisdictions treat tokens tied to payment networks could still affect sentiment. As a result, analysts see both risk and reward on the horizon. A New Presale Capturing Attention While XRP remains in the spotlight, presale investors are increasingly discussing MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project has become one of the fastest-growing opportunities of 2025, with forecasts suggesting it could deliver as much as 22,000% ROI. Early inflows from whales have already positioned it as a contender for the next bull cycle, and retail interest is surging as presale phases sell out. To add to the momentum, early participants can unlock a 50% EXTRA BONUS by using the code PATRIOT50X, effectively increasing their allocation before entry costs rise. For many, the combination of whale activity, strong community backing, and an ambitious roadmap makes it one of the most attractive presales currently available. Investors who believe XRP will rally still see MAGACOIN FINANCE as a way to diversify with potentially higher upside. The Broader Market Context XRP’s rally comes at a time when overall sentiment in crypto has improved. Bitcoin has stabilized above $115,000, Ethereum is gaining strength ahead of potential ETF inflows, and altcoins are drawing renewed interest. Analysts believe XRP could benefit from this broader environment, especially as traders look for assets with proven utility in cross-border payments. The positive backdrop also helps presales. When confidence in the market grows, investors are more willing to commit capital to early-stage projects. This creates a cycle where strong demand fuels faster sellouts, reinforcing bullish expectations. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been a prime example of this trend in 2025, as each phase of its presale has accelerated more quickly than the last. Long-Term Implications for XRP Looking further ahead, XRP’s success depends on whether financial institutions continue to integrate it into their settlement systems. Partnerships with banks, payment processors, and fintech platforms could drive adoption beyond speculation, giving XRP a stronger role in the global economy. If adoption keeps rising, analysts argue the token could eventually challenge its previous all-time highs above $3.80 and set new records. At the same time, competition is fierce. Other networks are working on faster and cheaper payment rails, which means XRP must continue innovating to maintain its advantage. Investors watching the long-term picture will be focused not only on price charts but also on adoption metrics and institutional traction. Conclusion XRP is once again proving its resilience, with price action and institutional interest suggesting that a rally could extend in the months ahead. Yet in presale circles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly being seen as a project with even greater potential, offering investors a chance to secure allocations before mainstream awareness drives valuations higher. Together, these dynamics show how 2025 could be a defining year for both established tokens and ambitious newcomers.

That kind of milestone reminds traders that explosive wins are still alive and well in the meme-driven side of crypto. In fact, the hunt for the next 1000x meme coin has never been louder, with retail investors and seasoned traders glued to presale buzz, community hype, and early-entry opportunities. MoonBull is one of those projects standing at the edge of the spotlight. With its whitelist model, elite staking rewards, and secret token drops, it’s not just a meme coin—it’s a culture play designed for crypto fans who don’t want to miss the next moonshot. Early insiders get the first swing at allocations, while the wider crowd has to wait for doors to crack open. That difference matters when prices are climbing by the second. MoonBull: The Best 1000x Meme Coin Project Of 2025 MoonBull ($MOBU) doesn’t waste time pretending to be just another random meme coin. It’s engineered as an Ethereum-based token with a built-in system of rewards, secret token drops, and tightly capped supply. The team designed it to keep things spicy from the jump: Stage One opens a presale window where insiders get early access at the lowest price possible. Those who whitelist receive the exact launch date ahead of everyone else, meaning they can jump in before the floodgates open. Here’s the kicker: entry to Stage One isn’t limited to whitelist members. Anyone can join when it officially launches. But only those who whitelist ahead of time get that exclusive notification with the date and time. In a market where seconds can equal serious gains, this isn’t just a bonus—it’s the edge that separates casual buyers from sharp players. What sets MoonBull apart is how it leans into community frenzy while keeping a backbone of real structure. Whitelist users don’t just get tokens; they unlock elite staking rewards, secret bonuses, and whispered hints about what’s next. That “what’s next” part is the most exciting, because the roadmap isn’t fully revealed. It’s a shadow launch that gives insiders the thrill of being in on something that most people don’t even know exists yet. Analysts already call MoonBull one of the best 1000x meme coin projects 2025 because it blends scarcity, community, and secrecy into one. With MoonBull’s whitelist growth potential climbing daily, its early narrative already positions it as a viral meme coin with legs. Add in the fact that it’s built on Ethereum for reliability and integration, and the project doesn’t just look fun—it looks sustainable in a space where most meme coins burn out. Between exclusive rewards, 1000x cryptos, trending meme coins, and whitelists now, and presales that vanish in seconds, MoonBull has become the one name degens are whispering about nonstop. Neiro: Meme Culture Meets Market Wildcards While MoonBull runs on exclusivity and careful staging, Neiro has taken a different route. It launched as a meme-heavy project rooted in internet culture, leaning hard into viral Twitter and TikTok trends. Its branding is edgy, playful, and designed to make people laugh. But that humor hides a real engine: a massive community that rallies behind every pump, dip, and rumor. Neiro doesn’t operate on capped supply windows like MoonBull. Instead, its strength lies in sheer exposure. Every meme, video, and share fuels a larger snowball effect that keeps new traders curious. It thrives in chaos. The volatility is wild, but that’s part of the draw. Traders aren’t looking for stability—they’re chasing that one chart that looks like it’ll never stop going up. Still, there’s risk. Neiro doesn’t have the same insider whitelist opportunities or elite staking structures. It lives and dies by its community’s energy. When the hype is hot, it’s hotter than almost any other meme coin. But when attention drifts, holders can find themselves waiting out long dry spells. That unpredictability keeps it exciting but also makes it a tougher hold for those who want a more structured 1000x meme coin. Banana For Scale: The OG Meme Coin Energy Banana For Scale came out swinging as a meme-first project, inspired by one of the internet’s oldest and funniest measuring jokes. It’s absurd, and that’s the point. Its marketing plays off randomness, leaning into nostalgia and internet culture that Gen Z and Millennials both recognize. The coin’s strength isn’t in utility—it’s in the viral power of something silly that everybody gets. This project thrives on inside jokes. The more you understand the meme, the funnier it becomes. That humor builds community because people feel like they’re part of an inside club. Banana For Scale doesn’t try to overpromise. It’s not offering secret staking rewards or a roadmap of exclusive token drops. Instead, it banks on one thing: making crypto fun again. Price action has reflected that. At its peak moments, Banana For Scale has rallied on nothing but memes and word-of-mouth. For a while, it even pulled traders away from more structured projects simply because it was fun. That energy is what keeps it on the list of potential 1000x meme coin contenders. After all, meme coins are often less about the tech and more about the energy. Final Thoughts Based on the research and market trends, MoonBull, Neiro, and Banana For Scale each bring something unique to the meme coin table. Neiro thrives on constant internet humor, Banana For Scale leans into old-school meme culture, and MoonBull combines exclusivity with Ethereum’s reliability. Among them, MoonBull stands out for its structure, scarcity, and promise of exclusive insider perks. It has already earned a spot among the best 1000x meme coin projects 2025. Traders who want early access, secret rewards, and the thrill of being in before the crowd need to pay attention now. Join the MoonBull whitelist now.

A 1000x meme coin is a cryptocurrency that has the potential to multiply an investor’s entry value by one thousand times, usually driven by hype, memes, and early-entry momentum. Why Is MoonBull Called One Of The Best 1000x Meme Coin Projects 2025? MoonBull is recognized as one of the best due to its whitelist growth potential, capped supply, elite staking rewards, and presale exclusivity on Ethereum. How Does MoonBull’s Whitelist Work? Whitelisting lets users register their email for early access. Members receive launch details ahead of the public, giving them the edge to buy at the lowest price. Is Neiro Or Banana For Scale A Safer Bet Than MoonBull? Both have potential, but they rely heavily on hype. MoonBull blends meme frenzy with Ethereum-based security, making it the stronger option for those seeking structure and exclusivity. How Can Someone Join The MoonBull Presale? Entering the presale is simple: submit an email to the encrypted whitelist form. Once confirmed, details about the Stage One presale arrive before anyone else.

After holding steady in the early hours, SHIB faced consistent selling pressure, pushing the price downward. Source: Coinmarketcap Shiba Inu (SHIB) is drawing renewed attention after popular community member Heber Mayen suggested the token is preparing for an explosive breakout. In a recent post, Mayen highlighted that Shiba Inu’s one-month price chart is showing a 3.65% gain over the past 30 days to $0.00001345. The asset has been consolidating within a descending triangle pattern, which has historically signaled major price movements once the pattern reaches its end. According to Mayen’s analysis, Shiba Inu is nearing the extreme low point of its triangle structure. This technical setup suggests a decisive move is imminent. He expressed confidence in a bullish breakout, supported by strong momentum indicators Is Shiba Inu ATH Incoming? Community analyst Shib Spain also echoed a bullish stance. He suggested Shiba Inu is consolidating within the $0.00001270 to $0.00001347 support range. He anticipates a rebound from this level, which could provide the base for a strong uptrend. If sustained, this momentum might help Shiba Inu challenge previous price barriers. Source: X While Mayen refrained from setting a specific price target or timeline, Shib Spain went further in his outlook. To achieve this, Shiba Inu would need to surge by 568% from its current level to surpass its October 2021 peak of $0.00008845. Such a move would mark a significant recovery and reaffirm SHIB’s potential as a high-volatility meme token capable of rapid rallies under favorable market conditions. SHIB Consolidates as Indicators Show Neutral Momentum The daily SHIB shows that price action has entered a period of consolidation after a recent upward move. Price candles reveal that SHIB has been fluctuating between approximately $0.00001250 and $0.00001360 over the last sessions, repeatedly failing to break above the $0.00001400 resistance. SHIB/USD price chart, Source: TradingView The MACD is showing a bullish signal, as the blue MACD line has crossed above the orange signal line, supported by rising green histogram bars that reflect strengthening upward momentum.

This development comes amid a rather volatile moment as LINK prices have declined by almost 5% in the past day following a double price rejection at the $24.80 region. Related Reading: Chainlink Primed For Takeoff: Liquidity Sweep Strengthens Bullish Outlook LINK Bulls Face Key Test At $25 Before Potential Run To $30 In an X post on September 19, Martinez shares an in-depth technical analysis highlighting that Chainlink (LINK) is approaching a decisive moment, having previously tested the $25 resistance zone, a price point crucial to the next bullish leg of the altcoin. Notably, Martinez’s analysis also suggests that LINK is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle, with volatility compressing ahead of what could be a significant breakout. At press time, LINK trades around $23.60, just below the crucial $24.80–$25 zone, which aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. The renowned analyst notes that clearing this barrier could unlock the path toward $27.85, the 1.0 Fibonacci extension, before LINK sets its sights on the $30.12 target (1.272 Fibonacci level). Beyond that, the altcoin could also seize a potential move toward $31.39, if bullish momentum continues. Meanwhile, the symmetrical triangle pattern indicates a period of indecision between buyers and sellers, but as the price action coils tighter near the apex, the likelihood of a breakout increases. If current market demand intensifies under this condition, the $25 breakout could act as the ignition point for a larger rally. However, failure to breach resistance could send LINK back to lower support levels around $23.30 (0.382 Fib) before attempting another breakout. In a bearish case, LINK could break below the symmetrical triangle, with potential support zones set around or even $22.30 (0.236 Fib) or $20.85 (0).

This negative performance only underlines the struggles of LINK in the past month, during which it declined by 11.30%. Meanwhile, recent information shared by Coin Bureau indicates Chainlink ($LINK) may be on the verge of a supply shock as exchange balances have dropped to their lowest levels since 2022. This sharp decline signals that holders are moving coins off exchanges, reducing immediate sell pressure and tightening available supply. At the same time, Martinez also reports that whale activity has surged, with nearly 2 million LINK accumulated in the last 48 hours, underscoring strong confidence from large investors. The combination of reduced exchange liquidity and aggressive whale accumulation is often a precursor to a sharp, significant rally, as demand outpaces available supply.

WeRide said it will work with Grab Holdings Ltd of Singapore to provide autonomous rides for users travelling on two authorized routes in the Punggol neighbourhood. Pony AI outlined a parallel push with ComfortDelGro. The companies aim to start service within the next several months. The move positions Singapore as a key hub for driverless transport in Southeast Asia. Singapore’s Land Transport Authority said its route will cover 12 kilometres in Punggol. WeRide and Grab will operate vehicles along 10km and 12km routes, matching the government’s approved routes for trials. Singapore positions itself as a hub for robotaxi deployment The announcements follow a June update from the Ministry of Transport of Singapore. This particular update suggested that the government intends to introduce autonomous vehicles across public housing estates by year-end and integrate the technology within the national public transport system. Chinese autonomous-driving firms are also pushing abroad. US-listed Pony AI and WeRide, along with Baidu’s Apollo Go, are pressing across Europe, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Baidu Inc. is preparing to launch Apollo Go in Malaysia and Singapore as soon as this year, according to an earlier report by Bloomberg. Tesla Robotaxi Pilot draws scrutiny after three crashes in Austin Meanwhile, in the United States, Tesla’s early data on its own self-driving pilot is drawing attention. A crash report filed with federal regulators lists three collisions tied to the Tesla robotaxi program, only 10 days after the pilot began in Austin, Texas. Tesla withheld much of the detailed data in the filing, citing proprietary information. The fleet, made up of about a dozen cars, had covered up to 7,000 miles in total, according to figures cited in the filing. It remains unclear exactly the number of miles the cars travelled during Tesla’s July 23 earnings call. Executives said the vehicles had travelled 7,000 miles, which could reflect the initial 30 days or only the miles recorded between June 22 and June 30. Tesla’s Austin vehicles are not fully autonomous and require a trained driver to sit in the front seat. The company refers to it as a “safety monitor.” Similar to a driving instructor, that person holds a safety stop button, can reach the steering wheel, and is the legally responsible driver available to assume control if the system does not function normally. A program with a human safety driver on board would typically be expected to experience fewer crashes. Tesla says its Autopilot system, used mainly on freeways with human supervision, has logged airbag deployments about once per 5 million miles. The company has also asserted the system is “10x better.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Tech|Pony AI|Tesla|WeRide,EN,0,0,ASIA|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-20 22:53:28

After the announcement was made on Friday, major companies including Microsoft, Amazon, and JPMorgan sent urgent internal memos to staff, instructing H-1B visa holders already in the United States not to travel abroad, and urging those outside the country to return before the new fee system takes effect. The tech industry is bracing for market disruption The Trump administration announced its immigration policy , a $100,000 annual fee, on H-1B visas, the temporary employment permit used by thousands of foreign workers in the U.S. technology sector. The policy is set to take effect by midnight Saturday and is part of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on both legal and illegal immigration since he took office in January. “H-1B visa holders who are currently in the U.S. should remain in the U.S. and avoid international travel until the government issues clear travel guidance,” the law firm Ogletree Deakins wrote in an advisory to staff. The firm handles the bank’s visa applications. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended the measure , saying that it was a way to prioritize American graduates. “If you’re going to train somebody, you’re going to train one of the recent graduates from one of the great universities across our land. Train Americans. Stop bringing in people to take our jobs.” The new fee, which is reportedly $100,000 a year for each of the three years of a visa’s initial duration, is a significant increase from the current application costs of only a few thousand dollars. Analysts warned that the change could increase labor costs by millions for large firms, while startups and smaller tech firms could find the added burden unsustainable. India is bracing for impact The new rules have also rattled India’s $283 billion IT outsourcing industry. The Asian nation accounted for 71% of H-1B approvals in 2024, far ahead of China’s 11.7%, according to government data. “The additional cost will require adjustments, and the one-day deadline for implementation is destabilizing,” Nasscom said in a statement. The group added that the measure could have “ripple effects” on U.S. innovation and the global job market, particularly in technology services and artificial intelligence. Some analysts noted that the rule could force companies to relocate their high-value projects overseas, which would unintentionally accelerate the transfer of talent and capital to rival innovation hubs in Asia and Europe. “In the short term, Washington may collect a windfall; in the long term, the U.S. risks taxing away its innovation edge, trading dynamism for short-sighted protectionism,” Jeremy Goldman, an analyst at eMarketer, said . Critics of the H-1B program argue that it has been used to depress wages for American workers, but supporters insist that the visa brings in talent that the domestic labor market cannot supply fast enough. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, himself a former H-1B holder, reiterated on X that the program is “essential” to filling the skills gap. The H-1B program currently offers 65,000 visas annually, with an additional 20,000 visas available for individuals with advanced U.S. degrees. At the same time, Trump has signed an executive order to create a new immigration track dubbed the “ gold card .” For a one-time payment of $1M, foreign nationals will be eligible for U.S. permanent residency. Supporters of the measure believe it will attract wealthy investors, while critics believe it increases inequalities by privileging the wealthy over skilled professionals.

From Sept. 11 to 17, Kalshi accounted for 62% of total volume in the on-chain prediction market sector, according to data from Dune Analytics , while Polymarket’s stood at 37%. The former’s weekly trading pace topped $500 million, with an average open interest of around $189 million. Its volume is beyond that of Polymarket, which stood at $430 million, and its average open interest of $164 million, which implies “sticker positions on Polymarket and faster turnover on Kalshi.” Polymarket's longer-term markets, which often stretch over weeks or months, keep user funds locked in for longer periods, essentially. This shows up in the open interest-to-volume ratio: Polymarket averaged 0.38, while Kalshi sat lower at 0.29. That suggests Kalshi's users are trading more often, while Polymarket's positions tend to sit. Still, Polymarket is building out a greater position in the U.S. The platform has cleared its acquisition of QCX , a regulated derivatives exchange, to enter the country again. It has also launched earnings-based markets with social investing platform Stocktwits, designed to let stockholders hedge earnings risk and analysts gauge market sentiment in real time.

The increasing wave of allocations is a sign that diversification is becoming the new corporate standard for crypto adoption. For many years, Bitcoin was the only name in the discussion about digital reserves. However, a new wave of filings suggests that institutional players are building a more diversified portfolio of assets. In other words, firms are backing the new digital financing assets, treating their crypto reserves more like an investment fund. XRP remains back in the spotlight again after getting shelved for regulatory issues. The much-discussed altcoin MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly risen to $13.5 million, resulting in XRP whales flocking to it while XRP itself is set to break a new ATH. Corporate Treasuries Embrace XRP Amber International Holdings has revealed a $100 million digital asset reserve, which is the most striking example so far. Amber employed strategies that were not only focused on Bitcoin but also included the use of XRP, Solana, Ethereum, BNB, and SUI. The firm has revealed its XRP exposure in past financial audits, a strong signal that XRP is being recognized as a proper reserve asset. It is a major deviation from MicroStrategy, which is only doubling down on Bitcoin. According to Bill Morgan, a lawyer, the new corporate norm is that a willingness to diversify – not your ideological loyalty to one chain – is what counts. For corporate boards, we consider risk management, liquidity and long-term growth potential. Multi-Million Allocations Boost Confidence Amber’s move is not an isolated case. Trident and Digital Tech Holdings have pledged $500 million for XRP; Webus International has set aside $300 million; VivoPower International will offer $121 million; and Wellgistics Health has lined up $50 million in credit for further purchases. All of these commitments suggest a growing consensus that XRP should be part of modern treasuries, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The continuous accumulation of whale has enhanced the XRP price rise to surpass $3 mark. XRP is now closer to its bull run after a prolonged period of low volatility, according to experts following its surge. The New Altcoin That Gains Whale Attention While XRP’s rise is headline-worthy, retail traders and some whales are also turning to new opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project’s rapid growth — reaching $13.5 million in record time — has attracted the attention of seasoned investors, including XRP holders diversifying into the next potential breakout. Analysts note that MAGACOIN FINANCE offers many of the traits that institutions are now seeking in reserve assets: strong security audits, scalability, and a fast-growing community. Comparisons to Shiba Inu’s early days have only fueled more speculation, as investors look for tokens with grassroots momentum capable of evolving into mainstream players. Favorable Timing for XRP XRP above $3 has received some good support. With clarity achieved in the law, the regulatory uncertainty moat that kept institutions on the fence for years has been removed. At the same time, ETF applications associated with XRP remain pending, creating anticipation that approval would enhance its legitimacy. Thus, corporate adoption is likely to be made. Firms can minimise risk and improve cash management by including XRP into treasuries. The move puts them behind a well-established, liquid, and widely accepted token. The industry is starting to rethink bitcoin-only reserves due to concern over its volatile price and diversifying into a basket of coins. A Shift in Corporate Strategy The embrace of XRP signals a maturing crypto market. Treasuries are no longer mere ideological statements; they are risk-managed portfolios. When you invest in various assets, it reduces the amount of money you have tied up in any one asset. Subsequently, your experience is less affected by any one asset’s price volatility. As a result, you have broader access to the growth of the digital asset sector. This trend mirrors the way traditional finance works. Just as companies have cash reserves that may not just hold cash, treasury reserves are taking form in crypto too. Due to XRP’s liquidity, established history, and recently reclaimed trust by institutions, it should easily cut. The Road Ahead for XRP The market will watch how far XRP’s near-term momentum can carry prices above all-time highs. The growing whale accumulation and corporate treasury demand are paving a bullish path. If these ETF approvals are granted and institutional allocations continue, XRP could be one of the defining winners of this cycle. Currently, the rise of MAGACOIN FINANCE shows that institutional adoption isn’t the only growth driver in crypto. Solid grassroots projects with explosive community growth still capture the attention of whales and can provide surprising upside. Conclusion XRP moved past the $3 mark thanks to the recent corporate adoption from major names like Mastercard and Visa. Companies are abandoning the bitcoin-only strategy and are now looking at digital assets in a much broader portfolio. Institutional demand is coming up strong as Amber International, Trident Digital, and Webus International allocate hefty amounts to FTX. As corporate treasuries diversify, XRP stands to gain new legitimacy and liquidity. However, it is also retail investors who are impacting the story as MAGACOIN FINANCE emerges as a new whale opportunity. All these aspects show how the space is changing – institutional money is setting down new roots, while dynamic new tokens are stretching the limits.

Worldcoin has surged by more than 80% in just seven days, reaching around $1.60 and lifting its market cap above $3.2 billion. Trading volumes have also exploded, drawing a wave of speculative activity. The question now dominating market chatter is whether WLD can break the $2 resistance zone or if sellers will step in to take profits, bringing the rally to a pause. In the meantime another altcoin is gaining major attention due to its explosive growth – MAGACOIN FINANCE’s. Momentum Behind the Rally The rally hasn’t come out of nowhere. Renewed interest from both retail and institutional investors has fueled demand, while on-chain data shows large holders reducing their positions. In fact, whale-controlled supply has dropped to its lowest point since July, suggesting that profit-taking among big players may have cleared the way for retail investors to drive the token upward. Institutional accumulation has also been reported across several exchanges, hinting that more traditional capital is flowing into the project. Combined with growing liquidity, this has strengthened short-term momentum and helped WLD resist sharp sell-offs. Beyond price action, Worldcoin’s ambitious long-term vision continues to attract attention. The project aims to build a global proof-of-personhood network through its biometric “World ID” system. While this has raised regulatory concerns, particularly around data privacy, the concept has kept Worldcoin in the spotlight as a potentially disruptive force in digital identity. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Recognition While Worldcoin rides its breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly cementing itself as one of the fastest-growing altcoins in 2025. Security audits, a clear roadmap, and an expanding community base have positioned the project as a promising contender in the crowded crypto landscape. Analysts suggest that the combination of transparency, scalability, and grassroots support is what makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out. Unlike the heavily institutionalized flows that are driving Solana and Worldcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rise is powered by retail adoption and strong community growth. Many market watchers view this as a healthy sign, particularly for a token still in its early stages. While it may not have hit mainstream headlines yet, its momentum points toward the potential for rapid recognition as market conditions evolve. Technical Analysis: Critical Levels Looking closer at Worldcoin’s charts, indicators suggest the token has entered a consolidation zone following its explosive rally. The relative strength index (RSI) is around 42 on the hourly timeframe, which leaves room for further upside without flashing overbought conditions. This makes a continuation possible if demand strengthens again. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) has also shown signs of turning positive, while short-term moving averages have crossed above longer-term ones. These technical signals support a bullish bias in the short run. The nearest resistance lies around $1.84. Worldcoin tested this level once but failed to close above it, which makes it the key barrier to watch. A successful breakout there could trigger the next leg higher, with $2.00 emerging as the next psychological milestone. Should momentum remain strong, upside targets between $2.50 and $3.50 are plausible in the months ahead. On the flip side, downside risks remain clear. The $1.20 to $1.25 range has acted as strong support, but if bears manage to push the price below that zone, a retest of $1.00 or even $0.80 could follow. Such a move would erase much of the recent gains and potentially dampen enthusiasm among traders. Bullish Case: Short- and Long-Term Targets Short term, analysts believe the $1.80 to $2.00 zone is well within reach. If Worldcoin manages to break through $2 with sustained trading volume, it could open the path toward $2.50–$3.50. Longer term, if adoption of the World ID project accelerates and regulators provide clarity instead of roadblocks, some market experts think WLD could revisit the $5 level within a year. The bullish case ultimately rests on whether investors see the proof-of-personhood model as a viable, scalable solution in the digital age. If that narrative strengthens, demand for WLD could expand far beyond speculation. Bearish Case: Regulatory Risks and Whale Activity Despite optimism, there are clear risks. Regulatory pushback on biometric data collection has already raised concerns in several regions. If more jurisdictions restrict or ban the technology, it could undermine adoption and weaken investor confidence. Another major risk lies in whale activity. While recent selling has eased, large holders remain a powerful influence. Renewed profit-taking could overwhelm retail demand, sending prices lower in a matter of hours. Conclusion Worldcoin’s rapid climb has captured market attention, with the $2 barrier now looming as the next big test. The technical outlook suggests further upside is possible, but traders should be wary of volatility as both regulatory headlines and whale activity continue to shape the market. For now, the short-term bias leans bullish, with targets above $2 in play. Longer term, much depends on whether World ID adoption scales despite scrutiny. At the same time, new projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are building from the ground up, offering fresh opportunities for those looking beyond the biggest names. Together, they represent the dual forces of the crypto market: explosive rallies driven by speculation and the steady rise of community-driven projects.

Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-on-coinbase-plunges-95-heres-the-implication/,"Abs Nassif, host of the Good Morning Crypto podcast, reported on September 19 that Coinbase now holds only two wallets containing a combined 32.8 million XRP. He stated that this represents a 95% drop since June 5, when Coinbase held 970 million units. This steep reduction shows how quickly institutional and retail buyers have been acquiring XRP. The sharp decline in exchange wallets from 970 million to 32.8 million units indicates a substantial outflow of tokens, signaling a significant shift in available liquidity that traders and analysts closely monitor. BREAKING: COINBASE IS DOWN TO 2 WALLETS W/ 32.8 MILLION $XRP ! THIS IS 95% DOWN SINCE JUNE 5, WHEN COINBASE HAD 970 MILLION UNITS! https://t.co/yE4W7vMutn — Good Morning Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) September 19, 2025 Shrinking Supply Creates Pressure A rapid reduction in available supply on a major exchange changes the market dynamic. When large amounts of XRP leave centralized platforms, it becomes more difficult for new buyers to obtain large quantities at stable prices. This effect can create upward price pressure if demand remains steady or increases. The size and speed of Coinbase’s XRP decline suggest strong ongoing demand across multiple investor categories. Although some of these assets could be moving into custody solutions, wallets controlled by whales and long-term investors, the immediate effect on the exchange’s order books is reduced supply. Such a situation often gives confidence to traders expecting higher prices, especially when major exchanges show sustained outflows over time. Supply Shocks in Digital Assets Supply shocks occur when a sudden or sustained change in available quantity disrupts normal market conditions. In the case of XRP, a 95% reduction of exchange reserves over a few months fits this pattern. If buyers continue to acquire XRP while exchanges hold limited amounts, the resulting scarcity can push prices higher. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market participants view this as a sign of accumulation, where holders plan to retain assets rather than trade them quickly. Historically, in cryptocurrency markets, significant outflows from exchanges have correlated with price increases, as coins become less available to meet demand. XRP’s current situation aligns with that trend, and some believe a supply shock is inevitable , making it a focal point for investors tracking exchange flows. Potential Benefits for XRP Holders If the current rate of XRP accumulation continues, the reduced exchange reserves could set the stage for stronger pricing. As liquidity tightens, it may force buyers to pay more to acquire the same amount of XRP. For holders, this can translate into notable gains if market conditions support continued demand.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-its-time-for-massive-xrp-breakout-heres-why/,"XRP’s price action has entered a decisive phase after months of consolidation. In a recent post on X, prominent crypto analyst Carl Moon shared a chart predicting a massive breakout for XRP. His post coincided with a surge of interest around XRP’s market structure as the token moved through major liquidity zones. The comment showed his view that XRP’s latest moves have cleared obstacles that previously restrained its price. XRP’s Liquidity Sweep and Market Structure The chart Moon posted shows XRP completing what he described as a sweep of both “buy side liquidity” and “sell side liquidity.” This liquidity sweep indicates that the token has run price levels where both buyers and sellers placed large orders, a process often associated with clearing the market of weaker positions. $XRP Swept both sides! Its time for a massive breakout!

Another key feature of the chart is a symmetrical triangle pattern drawn from June to September, with a breakout point marked just above $3. He highlighted a breakout trade investors can make near current levels, marking this area as a launch point for a possible upward move. If his analysis holds, it could send XRP above $6, marking a new all-time high for the digital asset. Why This Matters for Price Movement Moon’s chart also highlights a “Smart Money First TP” (take profit) around $3.70 and a “Final TP” near $6.19. These levels suggest the analyst expects XRP to continue appreciating if the breakout holds. By sweeping liquidity on both sides, XRP may have removed near-term resistance , potentially allowing a cleaner path for the price to trend upward. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Volume profile data on the left side of the chart further supports this view. The histogram shows heavier trading activity around $2.00 to $2.50 and much thinner volume above $3.50, hinting that once the price surpasses these zones, it could move more freely toward higher targets. The posted chart implies that XRP’s consolidation phase has matured and that buyers have stepped in following the liquidity sweep. XRP’s Next Steps Moon’s analysis also highlights how XRP’s recent technical behavior aligns with a bullish narrative. His callout of both liquidity sweeps, the breakout zone, and projected take-profit levels offers a structured roadmap for observers tracking XRP’s movements. If XRP maintains support above the breakout zone and volume continues to build, the technical setup outlined in Moon’s chart could mark the beginning of an extended move potentially culminating above $6.

52033010,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=824858,1758412829,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52033010.jpeg,"As XRP Grabs Headlines, Can Cardano Price Surge Toward $100?",https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/as-xrp-grabs-headlines-can-cardano-price-surge-toward-100/,"While tokens like XRP dominate headlines amid rising ETF approval speculations, the Cardano price is also gaining attention as market conditions slowly recover from bearish trends. New data from Changelly, a crypto exchange, has suggested that Cardano could be gearing up for a massive breakout. The big question now is whether the cryptocurrency has the momentum to reach a $100 milestone. Why A $100 Cardano Price Remains A Distant Goal Cardano’s price action has generated significant interest in recent months, as analysts from Changelly attempt to project its next big move. According to their forecasts, ADA remains a relatively low-priced cryptocurrency compared to some of its altcoin rivals like XRP, with projections pointing to modest gains in the near term and a potential surge above $100 by 2040. Related Reading: Bitmine’s Ethereum Appetite Grows With Fresh $70 Million Buy Changelly’s outlook for 2025 suggests a trading range between $0.77 and $0.97, with the average price stabilizing around $1.17. These numbers highlight a steady upward trend but remain far from the speculative $100 level. Breaking this down further, experts from the crypto platform project that in September 2025, ADA could fluctuate between $0.891 and $0.924, averaging near $0.908. By October 2025, expectations widen slightly, with potential movement between $0.88 and $1.17. November’s outlook places the Cardano price between $0.77 and $1.05, averaging around $0.91, while December 2025 suggests values between $0.807 and $0.87. Taken together, these estimates show that ADA is likely to continue strengthening its price floor while maintaining realistic, incremental growth rather than explosive parabolic moves. From this perspective, a $100 Cardano price seems improbable within the near or mid-term future. However, in the long-term, Changelly predicts that ADA could exceed the $100 target to reach $116.83 by February 2040. The maximum price for that month has also been set at $132.72. Cardano’s Price Action While Changelly’s technical analysis provides insight into potential short-term price movements, Cardano’s long-term story is deeply rooted in its fundamentals. At present, the cryptocurrency trades around $0.91 with a circulating supply of over 35.7 billion ADA, giving it a market capitalization of approximately $32 billion. ADA has displayed steady momentum in the last week, climbing 1.48% and nearly 6% over the past month. According to Changelly, this growth signals that Cardano still commands a solid market presence, reinforcing its potential for a breakout soon. Although the cryptocurrency has dipped by over $0.01 in the past 24 hours, Changelly points out that recent trading activity has turned notably bullish for the cryptocurrency.

Still, Changelly notes that ADA is showing great potential lately, suggesting that its current price level could be a good buying opportunity for investors.

A growing number of public companies hold massive amounts of Bitcoin on their balance sheets. For investors buying these stocks, it can sometimes offer even greater upside than holding BTC itself. Why Some Bitcoin Stocks Outpace BTC Itself In a thought-provoking post on X, Adam Livingston, author of the Bitcoin Age and the Great Harvest, offers a compelling argument for why investors should consider buying the stock of Bitcoin treasury companies, rather than just BTC itself. His perspective goes beyond a simple leveraged play and speaks to a long-term vision of a new financial infrastructure built on a BTC foundation. Livingston’s thesis is that a new paradigm-shifting financial infrastructure built over the coming years will take Bitcoin to $100-200 trillion BTC market, supporting an equal magnitude of Bitcoin-denominated credit and equity. This new infrastructure would enable global transactions at light speed on open ledgers, providing everyone with a censorship-resistant, inflation-proof yield stream. The key takeaway from the recent unconference is that this infrastructure needs to be built because it is where solving complex issues, such as custody, compliance, and distribution across different jurisdictions, comes into play. It also involves creating products that cater to traditional investors who may not want or need a volatile, infinite-duration asset like Bitcoin itself. Thus, these products can strip away volatility, manage duration, or FX risk , allowing institutions and individuals to gain the spread and recycle profits back into BTC collateral. However, Livingston argues that Bitcoin can enable the exact instruments they do want. If BTC is to reach $1,000,000, it will require a robust financial infrastructure to funnel global capital into the asset . Why Waiting For A Bear Market Is A Flawed Strategy Crypto analyst Rajatsonfinance has highlighted a contrarian perspective on Bitcoin investing, urging people to abandon the common strategy of waiting for a bear market to start buying. Instead, he advocates for a more proactive approach centered on value creation and consistent accumulation. According to Rajatsonfinance, trying to time the market is a flawed and often unsuccessful endeavor. He argues that waiting for a crash could be used to build skills and create value in the real world. His primary advice is to focus on earning more money and then exchanging that income for Bitcoin, whether by selling services for dollars and converting them or by accepting BTC directly as payment. The analyst emphasized that if executed with a solid idea, passion, and consistent effort, it can lead to a far more significant BTC stack than one could ever accumulate by trying to buy the dip. He suggests that a successful business or a well-executed side hustle has the potential to generate far more than a modest $10,000 to $15,000, which would result in a holding far exceeding 0.1 BTC.",Bitcoin News|Adam Livingston|bitcoin|Bitcoin Age and the Great Harvest|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Rajatsonifinance,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-21 00:00:34

That move surprised the bond market. The 10-year Treasury yield, which had dipped below 4%, jumped to 4.145%. The 30-year yield, the one that matters for mortgages, rose to 4.76%, after hitting a weekly low of 4.604%. The Fed lowered its policy rate by 0.25% to 4.00%-4.25% on Wednesday, its first rate cut of the year. That helped push stocks higher, but the bond market didn’t react the same way. According to Bloomberg, investors in longer-term bonds didn’t get what they wanted — certainty that inflation would stay under control. Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at One Point BFG Wealth Partners, said traders used the Fed’s move to take profits, calling it a chance to “sell the news.” Peter said people holding long bonds “don’t want the Fed to be cutting interest rates.” When traders dump those bonds, prices go down and yields rise. That’s exactly what happened. Powell’s ‘risk management’ cut faces doubts from bond traders Peter pointed out that easing monetary policy while inflation is above 3% — and while the economy’s still solid — sends a risky signal. He said the Fed might be “taking the eye off” inflation. New Fed projections released on Wednesday show officials now expect inflation to rise slightly next year. That’s not what bondholders wanted to hear. Investors had hoped the Fed would move its focus away from inflation and toward jobs, especially after weak employment numbers earlier this month. Jerome Powell described the cut as a “risk management” move, mentioning the slowing labor market. But Peter said , “The bond market, if [longer yields] continue higher, would be sending a message that, ‘We don’t think you should be aggressively cutting interest rates with inflation stuck at 3%.’” He also explained that this week’s jump in yields came after bond prices had already been rising for months. Yields had fallen, but now they’re moving back up — just like they did after the Fed’s cut in September 2024. Peter said it’s worth noting that the 10-year yield hasn’t moved much since the start of the year, even though the Fed has cut rates more than once since then. Higher yields aren’t just bad news for bondholders. They affect everything from home loans to car financing. Mortgage rates rose after the Fed’s cut, wiping out the gains from their three-year low earlier in the week. That hit housing. On Thursday, homebuilder Lennar reported disappointing revenue for the third quarter and warned that deliveries would be weak in the next one. Co-CEO Stuart Miller blamed “continued pressures” in the housing market and “elevated” interest rates through Q3. Bond market waits for terrible news before buying again Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, said the bond market doesn’t move on one rate cut. He said, “It’s not the journey, it’s the destination.” What matters is how far the Fed plans to go. Chris said traders are trying to figure out “what’s the end game in this?” and that they’ll only respond once they’re convinced the Fed is serious about cutting rates significantly. Peter added that U.S. yields also follow what’s happening abroad. He said international rates have been rising, too, so foreign central bank actions matter here. But Chris had a warning for anyone rooting for lower yields. He said falling yields usually mean a recession’s coming. This week’s yield jump came right after jobless claims fell, which shows less risk of a downturn anytime soon. Chris said, “Don’t rejoice so much about getting bond yields down, because it may mean that it’s impossible for you to find work.” He also added, “Unfortunately, the bond market only really embraces bad news. Not just bad news … terrible news.” Get seen where it counts.

The notice appeared late Friday on the Bureau’s website and said only, “We will update users when more information is available.” Erika, who was nominated by President Joe Biden in 2023 and confirmed by the Senate the next year, was removed just hours after her team reported disappointing July job numbers and downward revisions for the two previous months. She found out about her firing through a two-line email from the White House Office of Presidential Personnel. “To be honest, I didn’t actually believe I had been fired,” Erika said Tuesday during an event at Bard College. She only checked her inbox after a reporter called her for comment about Trump’s post on X demanding she be fired. Trump calls numbers rigged, White House removes Erika after jobs release The jobs report that triggered the blowup was sent out on August 1. Erika briefed the Labor Department at 8 a.m. that morning and told them late-reporting firms had dragged the data down. “I explained to the Secretary that the negative skew in job growth among the late reporting firms was an unusual event, but not an unprecedented one,” she said. She added that other labor market data looked stable, and this wasn’t necessarily a sign of recession. Still, she said the room was silent. “The faces around the table were glum,” Erika said. “I asked if anyone had any questions on the revisions before we moved on to the July numbers. There were none, so we moved on.” By 2 p.m. that day, Trump had posted online saying the numbers were manipulated. Later that afternoon, he announced that Erika was no longer commissioner. On TV, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer described the revisions as “unexpected,” and said they were mostly tied to education and seasonal roles. Later, on X, she backed the firing. “I agree wholeheartedly with @POTUS that our jobs numbers must be fair, accurate, and never manipulated for political purposes,” she wrote. Since Erika’s removal, the BLS has made additional revisions. A benchmark update released on September 9 was met with more White House criticism, calling it “another blunder in the lengthy history of inaccuracies and incompetence at BLS.” Economists defended the revisions, saying they’re standard because businesses often submit data late. The BLS usually updates the numbers as more information comes in to make them more precise. Trump has picked EJ Antoni, the Heritage Foundation’s chief economist, to take over the job. EJ is known for his MAGA views and has drawn criticism from economists across party lines for his lack of experience. His Senate confirmation is still pending, and one Republican senator has already voiced “extreme reservations” about supporting him. Budget issues and staffing cuts worsen BLS operations The BLS has struggled for years with staff shortages and tight budgets. These problems didn’t start with Trump but have gotten worse during his second term. The agency now relies on a statistical method to fill in the gaps in inflation tracking. Only recently has it been allowed to hire more workers to collect price data again. The Labor Department’s Office of Inspector General opened a review last week into the BLS’ “challenges” around data collection and employment revisions. Erika had over 20 years of federal experience before her firing, including time at the Census Bureau, Treasury, and Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers. She called Trump’s move a “dangerous step” with “serious economic consequences.” She ended her speech by saying, “That’s an attack on the independence of an institution arguably as important as the Federal Reserve for economic stability.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",News|BLS,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-21 00:30:00
52033882,https://timestabloid.com/?p=83884,1758414608,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top 3 Altcoins That Will Likely Outperform Bitcoin in Q4,https://timestabloid.com/top-3-altcoins-that-will-likely-outperform-bitcoin-in-q4/,"Altcoins are braving turbulent conditions as Q3 winds down, leaving investors to question what the final quarter of the year might bring. Historically, September has been one of the weakest months for Bitcoin, often dragging other tokens lower in the process. But this year could play out differently. Analysts see favorable conditions that may allow select altcoins to take the lead, giving investors a chance to secure bigger gains before the cycle matures. In this shifting landscape, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly entered the spotlight , with some experts calling it one of the top picks for the season. A Break From Tradition September is known for muted performance, with Bitcoin traditionally averaging losses during this month across multiple years. Those declines have usually spread to the broader market, creating a cautious atmosphere among traders. However, analyst Michael Van De Poppe argues that the current cycle is not following the same pattern. He notes that while corrections have hit the market in recent weeks, momentum could flip in Q4 as altcoins resist Bitcoin’s seasonal weakness. “This cycle has played out differently from previous ones,” he explained, pointing out that conditions are aligning for altcoins to gain strength. If his outlook proves correct, Q4 could mark one of the most active altcoin seasons in recent memory. Federal Reserve Holds the Key One of the biggest catalysts on the horizon is the upcoming meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve. The central bank is widely expected to lower interest rates for the first time this year, trimming them by 25 basis points. With futures markets showing strong odds of such a move, optimism is building that liquidity conditions will improve. Lower rates tend to benefit high-growth and risk-on assets, particularly cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is often the first to react when conditions shift, setting the tone for the broader market. Van De Poppe compared the current setup to late 2019 and early 2020, when a supportive policy environment set the stage for a multi-month crypto rally. Token Unlocks and Market Impact At the same time, September brings a wave of token unlocks worth nearly $10 billion across various projects. These events typically add pressure by increasing supply, sparking fears of sell-offs. Yet this cycle could be different. Analysts highlight that much of the supply is often absorbed through private deals, softening the blow. Van De Poppe believes the bigger takeaway is that tokens without unlocks could shine brighter than those facing heavy selling pressure. For investors, this makes selectivity more important than ever. Choosing projects that combine strong fundamentals with clean tokenomics could be the key to outperforming Bitcoin in Q4. A Rare Opportunity Takes Center Stage While established altcoins are preparing for Q4, newer projects are also drawing serious attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE has already raised $14 million in its presale , a figure that highlights the enthusiasm around its launch. Some market experts suggest it could deliver as much as 45x returns for early participants if momentum holds. Unlike many presales that rely solely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building around utility and community growth. Its fast-moving presale phase and growing recognition across social platforms have positioned it as one of the most exciting projects heading into Q4. In an environment where investors are searching for the next big opportunity beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a clear contender. Altcoins to Watch According to Van De Poppe, the sectors with the strongest potential include decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), and tokens within the Ethereum ecosystem. These areas are already showing signs of renewed activity and could act as leaders if sentiment improves. Chainlink is one such example. The token has been building momentum and is currently trading in the $20 to $25 range , with investors closely watching to see if it can maintain upward pressure. Chainlink’s importance in powering decentralized data feeds continues to make it a top contender whenever altcoins trend higher. Other projects within DeFi and Ethereum-linked networks are also starting to show positive signs. With liquidity expected to improve after the Fed’s decision, analysts see these segments attracting both retail and institutional interest in the months ahead. Outlook for Q4 The stage is set for an eventful end to the year. If the Federal Reserve confirms rate cuts, conditions could align perfectly for altcoins to outperform Bitcoin, echoing past market cycles when smaller tokens surged as liquidity expanded. Chainlink and other Ethereum ecosystem projects are already showing sparks, while presale leaders like MAGACOIN FINANCE are generating excitement as high-upside plays. While risks remain, particularly with large token unlocks and lingering macroeconomic uncertainties, analysts believe the ingredients for a strong Q4 rally are in place. For investors, this could be one of the last major windows to position before the next phase of the bull market takes hold. Conclusion Altcoins are entering Q4 with a rare setup: Bitcoin’s seasonal weakness, a likely rate cut, and improving sentiment across key sectors. Chainlink and other ecosystem tokens are gaining traction, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about presales of 2025. If momentum builds, these projects could stand out as the top performers in the final quarter of the year.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $3.39 to $4.14. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.396 Market Cap $638.07M Trading Volume $6.13M Circulating Supply 1.609B FLOW All-time High $46.16 All-time Low $0.2916 24-hour High $0.4024 24-hour Low $0.3956 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 3.08% 50-Day SMA $0.3925 14-Day RSI 47.46 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 48 (Neutral) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $0.3985 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown FLOW is consolidating at $0.396, with $0.387 as critical support. RSI shows signs of seller fatigue. A possible buy zone is present at $0.387–$0.393. Flow coin 1-day price analysis On the daily timeframe for September 21, FLOW is consolidating just below the midline of the Bollinger Bands at $0.407, with the price pinned near $0.396. The recent red candles show that sellers have retained control after repeated failures to break past $0.427. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains bearish with the histogram still in negative territory, signaling fading bullish momentum. Volume has also declined, suggesting that traders are sitting on the sidelines, waiting for a decisive move. A buy-in could be considered near $0.387–$0.390 if support holds, with profit-taking targets around $0.407 and $0.425 if bullish momentum returns. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, FLOW is trading between $0.393 and $0.403 with no strong directional momentum. The Alligator indicator lines are compressed, reflecting consolidation, and resistance remains firm at $0.402–$0.404. The RSI is at 39, edging closer to oversold territory, signalling seller exhaustion. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView If FLOW slips below $0.387, further downside could follow. On the upside, reclaiming $0.404 would be key to regaining bullish traction, opening the door for a move toward $0.415 and potentially $0.425. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.4150 SELL SMA 5 $0.4062 SELL SMA 10 $0.4102 SELL SMA 21 $0.4070 SELL SMA 50 $0.3925 BUY SMA 100 $0.3787 BUY SMA 200 $0.3985 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.4095 SELL EMA 5 $0.4082 SELL EMA 10 $0.4034 SELL EMA 21 $0.3965 BUY EMA 50 $0.3885 BUY EMA 100 $0.3899 BUY EMA 200 $0.4278 SELL What to expect from Flow? If FLOW holds above $0.387, we might see a bounce toward $0.404–$0.425, but a breakdown below this support risks a slide toward $0.380 an lower. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance. Recent news/opinion on Flow Flow is seeing a big rise in activity after LayerZero integration, with transactions up over 600%. It continues to support major consumer apps like NBA Top Shot while improving its developer tools through Flow EVM and protocol upgrades. Flow Blockchain just posted one of its strongest quarters yet, blending consumer-scale adoption with surging DeFi momentum.

In comparison to PEPE, where the price movement is driven by memes and social buzz mostly, MUTM is being favored by investors for its sound DeFi fundamentals. The $0.035 token is built on a dual lending-and-borrowing protocol and is being regarded as a project that has actual staying power. Mutuum price in the current presale phase 6 is $0.035 per token. The presale has already attained more than $16.01 million and more than 16410 supporters. To investors who are exhausted by memecoin volatility, the change to MUTM is an indication of a larger trend, where 2025 could be the year when utility-based coins overtake hype-driven bets. PEPE Coin Near Support Levels as Meme Coin Sentiment Fades PEPE Coin (PEPE) is trading at the moment at $0.00001126 and its 24-hour range is at approximately $0.00001066 to $0.00001114. The token remains strong in its support zone, but it cannot go up without new catalysts. A lot of its price action is both community buzz and short emotion-based as it lacks underlying utility or protocol developments. DeFi token Mutuum Finance on the other hand is actively gaining the attention of investors who believe it has more lasting potential than PEPE. Mutuum Finance Presale Overheats MUTM presale round 6 presale indicates that the project is expanding rapidly. It has soared past 16.01 million and attracted more than 16410 holders. Those who purchase in this round will be able to make huge profits once the token can be traded. Mutuum Finance is establishing a healthy ecosystem, and stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Mutuum Finance has collaborated with CertiK to launch a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program to drive the security of the platform. The program also invites security developers, white-hat hackers as well as researchers to submit bugs. The bugs are classified according to risk and effort; risk, critical, major, minor, and low. The protocol is made strong by the program as user balances are maintained and the trust of the investors is energized. The protocol is risk-averse in terms of market exposure and illiquidity management, hence close levels, liquidation levels, and liquidator incentives do exist. The volatility of assets directly affects the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio and the liquidation guidelines: the higher the volatility of a particular asset, the more risky the parameters, the more lending regulations can be imposed. In addition to this, the reserve multipliers are risk-weighted on assets and make the protocol stable, safe and robust in any market nature. Changing Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance is building a passive lending and borrowing protocol, which will be based on active capital management and will give users the ability to borrow against stacks of coins that have been securitized. It uses the platform on stability algorithm and interest rate optimisation algorithm based on the efficiency drivers and long-term capital utilisation resilience. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly gaining popularity among investors who are no longer looking for meme-based investment projects, such as PEPE, but rather utility-based DeFi coins. Stage 6 tokens are valued at $0.035, and the presale has already raised an excess of $16.01 million and has 16,410+ holders. Supported by a $50,000 CertiK bug bounty, a USD-pegged stablecoin, and high-risk management measures, MUTM is safe, scaled, and useful in reality. With PEPE gaining traction but being hype-based, 2025 can be the year when investors prefer fundamentals. Get your MUTM tokens before the next price hike of the presale.

The BullZilla Ripple Cronos 2025 crypto narrative is gaining momentum, supported by Ripple momentum and BullZilla’s early access buzz. Cronos presale interest is adding to the BullZilla 100x hype, while the BullZilla crypto whitelist and Ripple gains continue to draw investor attention. With BullZilla presale growth and Cronos adoption aligning, these new coins, BullZilla, Ripple, and Cronos, are becoming standout presale opportunities. Looking ahead, the BullZilla 2025 top new crypto picks are positioned to shape the next wave of 100x growth stories. BullZilla: The Meme Coin That Doesn’t Just Roar—It Burns BullZilla isn’t just another meme coin riding waves of internet culture. It’s a project engineered to reward conviction through an innovative Roar Burn Mechanism that ties community engagement directly to token scarcity. Unlike traditional deflationary tactics, BullZilla integrates burning as a live, community-witnessed event, creating both excitement and measurable economic impact. Stage 3C: Whale Signal Detected BullZilla’s presale has already shown remarkable traction: Current Stage : Stage 3 (Phase 3C) Current Price : $0.00007241 Raised : $530,000+ Token Holders : Over 1,700 For early adopters, this is not just an entry point, it’s a chance to accumulate before a pivotal supply shift takes place. The Roar Burn Mechanism Explained Bull Zilla introduces a cyclical process of supply destruction tied to project milestones, described in three parts: Token Burn Every time the project unlocks a new chapter, a portion of $BZIL is permanently removed from circulation. This happens live on-chain, visible to all. Transparency is built into the DNA of this system. Roar Surge The burn isn’t silent. It comes with a wave of announcements across social channels, designed to amplify community excitement and awareness. Each surge signals progress, sparks conversations, and increases market demand. Price Dynamics Scarcity is the oldest driver of value. As supply contracts, remaining tokens become more valuable. Combined with surging attention, this mechanism has the potential to trigger exponential price growth. In practice, it means that every chapter achieved by BullZilla doesn’t just mark progress, it deepens scarcity, embedding a cycle of continuous upward pressure. Applications Beyond Speculation BullZilla positions itself as a cultural meme coin with tangible economic structures. Its presale narrative has already drawn comparisons to the early phases of meme coins that became household names, but the addition of the Roar Burn Mechanism adds structural integrity to its journey. With its unique approach, it is also being highlighted among the Top new coins for 100x gains, making it a standout in the presale market. Analysts suggest that BullZilla could join the ranks of the Top new coins for 100x gains in 2025 due to its strong community backing and innovative tokenomics. By designing scarcity into growth, BullZilla provides both narrative momentum and tokenomic discipline, two rare features in a space often dominated by hype without backing. Investment Scenario: $9,000 in BullZilla Today Imagine an allocation of $9,000 into BullZilla at the presale price of $0.00007241. That purchase would secure more than 124 million $BZIL tokens. Should BullZilla reach just $0.01 in the next cycle, that initial $9,000 allocation could grow into $1.24 million. While no projection is guaranteed, this hypothetical illustrates how structural scarcity combined with explosive community growth can lead to once-in-a-lifetime ROI opportunities. How to Buy BullZilla Coins Getting into BullZilla’s presale is designed to be straightforward: Set Up a Wallet Download a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Buy Ethereum (ETH) Purchase ETH from an exchange like Coinbase or Binance and transfer it to your wallet. Visit the Presale Site Connect your wallet to the official BullZilla presale portal. Swap ETH for $BZIL Select the desired allocation, confirm, and secure your position in the presale. Tokens are claimable after the presale concludes. For those looking at top new coins for 100x gains, the clock is ticking and BullZilla’s Roar Burn Mechanism makes every stage pricier than the last. Ripple: Regulatory Winds, Payment Rails, and Global Liquidity Ripple has been at the center of crypto’s most public regulatory battle. With recent clarity in its case against the SEC, Ripple now stands as one of the top new coins for 100x gains Ripple’s XRP Ledger enables near-instant cross-border payments at a fraction of the cost of traditional systems. Banks and payment providers no longer need to tie up capital in nostro accounts; instead, they can use XRP as a bridge asset to settle in seconds. What makes Ripple particularly compelling for 2025 is its dual positioning: on one hand, it appeals to regulators and institutions; on the other, it provides an open-source network that developers can build on. Analysts note that Ripple’s network throughput and liquidity depth make it one of the few scalable payment rails suitable for enterprise adoption. For investors seeking stability plus upside, Ripple offers something different from meme coins. It’s not about hype, it’s about embedding blockchain into the core of financial infrastructure rising as one of the top new coins for 100x gains Cronos: Building a Web3 Universe Beyond Exchanges Cronos is more than an exchange-linked chain. Backed by one of the most recognized names in crypto trading, it extends far beyond exchange services to become a full Web3 ecosystem. Cronos provides a scalable and interoperable blockchain built on the Cosmos SDK, with EVM compatibility that attracts Ethereum developers. The latest developments in Cronos’ roadmap show deep integration with DeFi, NFTs, and GameFi. By lowering transaction fees and enabling easy cross-chain asset transfers, Cronos has become an attractive hub for developers looking for reach without high costs. In the landscape of top new coins for 100x gains, Cronos offers something BullZilla and Ripple don’t: a hybrid of utility and accessibility that ties together trading, entertainment, and DeFi growth. Conclusion: Top New Coins for 100x Gains BullZilla ($BZIL) , Ripple, and Cronos together demonstrate the spectrum of opportunity in crypto. BullZilla’s Roar Burn Mechanism drives scarcity and cultural hype. Ripple pushes institutional adoption of real-time payments. Cronos expands ecosystems into gaming, NFTs, and DeFi.

52035687,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=178396,1758418220,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/52035687.jpeg,XRP Blows Past Corporate Giants – Experts Eye $6 Next,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-blows-past-corporate-giants-experts-eye-6-next/,"XRP has reached a historic milestone by surpassing some of the world’s largest corporations in market value. The cryptocurrency now boasts a capitalization of around $184 billion , overtaking Citigroup’s $183.6 billion valuation. It has also moved ahead of companies like Shopify and Verizon, solidifying its status as one of the top global assets. With momentum building, analysts believe XRP could push toward the $6 mark in the near term. Meanwhile, some experts note that MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing even faster growth at an earlier stage , leading many to label it one of the most promising altcoins of the current bull market. XRP’s Historic Milestone The latest rally saw XRP trade above $3.10 for the first time in weeks, delivering double-digit weekly gains. This surge has placed it among the world’s top 100 most valuable assets , ranking just below leading multinationals and financial institutions. For many observers, this moment is about more than numbers — it signals that cryptocurrency is increasingly being treated on par with established Wall Street giants. Crossing Citigroup’s market cap in particular is a symbolic achievement. Citigroup is one of the oldest and most influential banks in the United States, and for XRP to surpass its valuation demonstrates how far digital assets have come in challenging traditional finance. The fact that XRP now competes directly with corporate heavyweights for investor attention highlights the shifting balance between legacy institutions and blockchain-based alternatives. ETF Speculation Builds Momentum Much of XRP’s recent growth has been fueled by optimism around a potential XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) . According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, the REX-Osprey ETF is expected to launch as soon as next week, after a brief delay. The launch of such a product in the United States would be a landmark moment for XRP, providing investors with an easy way to gain exposure through traditional financial markets. This speculation has generated significant excitement, as ETFs often act as catalysts for new inflows from both retail and institutional players. Many analysts believe the ETF narrative is one of the primary drivers behind XRP’s push above $3 and could provide the fuel needed for further gains. XRP Faces a New Rival As XRP continues to make headlines, another name is starting to gain serious traction: MAGACOIN FINANCE . The project has quickly grown in popularity during its presale, drawing thousands of participants in just weeks. What sets it apart is its ability to scale community engagement at an impressive pace, while positioning itself as a forward-looking ecosystem rather than a one-dimensional token. Whales who have traditionally concentrated their holdings in XRP are now starting to diversify into MAGACOIN FINANCE, betting on its potential to deliver exponential growth. Analysts suggest that, at its current trajectory, MAGACOIN FINANCE could outpace XRP’s early adoption curve , establishing itself as one of the top performers in this bull cycle. Its unique mix of accessibility, innovation, and rapid momentum is why many see it as a standout altcoin for 2025. Real-World Use Strengthens XRP Beyond speculation, XRP’s real-world application has helped fuel confidence in its valuation. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, which uses XRP as a bridge currency for cross-border payments, is being adopted by financial institutions worldwide. This distinguishes XRP from purely speculative digital assets, giving it practical utility that supports long-term investor interest. The fact that banks and payment providers are increasingly using XRP adds another layer of credibility. Investors are not just buying into a token with hype-driven potential but into an asset that is already solving billion-dollar problems in international payments. This real-world adoption is part of what makes XRP’s latest achievements sustainable rather than fleeting. A Symbolic Shift The broader significance of XRP overtaking corporations like Citigroup and Shopify is that digital assets are no longer fringe investments. They now compete directly with some of the most recognizable companies in the world. This shift underscores how investor capital is diversifying, with traditional finance and crypto increasingly intersecting. Analysts stress that for XRP to maintain its bullish trajectory, follow-up strength will be needed. Sustaining momentum after major rallies is often the key to reaching higher levels. With the ETF launch on the horizon and continued real-world use cases, XRP appears well-positioned to take the next step toward the $6 target that many experts are eyeing. Conclusion XRP’s rise to a $184 billion market cap and its climb past major corporations represent a landmark moment for the crypto industry. The coming ETF launch could provide the spark needed for further growth, while Ripple’s payment network continues to solidify XRP’s long-term value. At the same time, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are showing extraordinary growth potential , with some predicting it could rival the early trajectory of XRP itself. Together, these developments highlight a crypto market that is not only thriving but increasingly competing head-to-head with the giants of traditional finance.

Notably, the crypto market leader initially surged to $118,000 as bullish sentiments rose after the US Federal Reserve announced the first interest rate cut of 2025. However, Bitcoin has since retraced to around $115,700 in the past 24 hours, as transaction activity cooled off. In studying the asset’s price structure, a popular market analyst with the X username KillaXBT has highlighted two important price levels. Related Reading: Countdown To ‘Bitcoin Bottom Day’: Why September 21 Could Change Everything Bitcoin’s Weekly Open Faces Pressure Amid Daily Imbalance Threat In an X post on September 19, KillaXBT shares a vital cautionary insight on the present Bitcoin market, identifying two support zones in danger. Notably, as of the latest session, BTC has retested its weekly open at $115,219, a level that has served as a key pivot point for both bulls and bears. Holding above this threshold would be a strong sign of strength, while a decisive move lower could tilt market sentiment bearish. However, there is also a heavy focus on a daily fair value gap extending down to $113,355, highlighted on the charts as an area of imbalance left behind by rapid price action. KillaXBT explains that losing the weekly open would likely trigger a price decline to $113,355 because such inefficiencies eventually get filled, as price retraces into the zone to rebalance order flow. However, there is also the presence of the previous wick low at $114,367, which currently sits just above the FVG zone. This intermediate support may act as a buffer before any deeper probe toward the $113,355 mark. According to KillaXBT, Bitcoin price holding above the weekly open and FVG price zone is critical for price action going into the next week. A successful price defence at these levels could result in a reclaim of $118,000 claim and potentially the present ATH at $124,000. Meanwhile, a decisive price fall below $113,355 would expose the premier cryptocurrency to downside targets around $112,000, $110,000, and $108,000.

The disruption, confirmed on July 25, 2025, comes only two years after Tether unveiled the Bitcoin mining project in the South American nation, citing a rich supply of renewable energy sources. Tether’s Operational Fallout With Rising Energy Bill According to local media Busqueda , the payment defaults by Tether began in May 2025. By June, UTE’s president, Andrea Cabrera, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Microfin, the local operator tied to the mining project, in an effort to negotiate a settlement. However, after arrears continued to mount, UTE invoked standard procedures, using security deposits before suspending power supply at the mining sites in Flores and Florida on July 25. The power cut produces immediate operational consequences, compromising the facilities’ computing nodes and reducing hash rate output, while slowing down general expansion goals. Meanwhile, restarting the sites will also incur additional costs, from renegotiating contracts to restoring technical capacity. And even such processes often require weeks, depending on the guarantees offered and compliance with regulatory protocols.Tether entered Uruguay in 2023 with plans to leverage the country’s renewable energy profile through its “Tether Energy” initiative. Uruguay generates approximately 95% of its electricity from non-fossil sources, making it one of the most attractive jurisdictions globally for “low-carbon” industrial activity. The project was positioned as a step toward diversifying Tether’s business model beyond stablecoin issuance, with ambitions to eventually secure 1% of Bitcoin’s global hash rate.Back in 2023, the company’s CTO, Paolo Ardoino, said about the project: By harnessing the power of Bitcoin and Uruguay’s renewable energy capabilities, Tether is leading the way in sustainable and responsible Bitcoin mining; Our unwavering commitment to renewable energy ensures that every Bitcoin we mine leaves a minimal ecological footprint while upholding the security and integrity of the Bitcoin network. Tether is proud to spearhead a movement that combines cutting-edge technology, sustainable practices, and financial innovation Following the recent revelations by the Uruguayan media, neither Tether nor Microfin has yet to reveal their official position. USDT Reaches New Market Cap High At $171.5 Billion In other news, Tether’s stablecoin USDT has attained a new market cap value of $171.5 billion, strengthening its dominant market position.

After breaking out of its key $0.22–$0.24 channel, momentum is building as bullish signals align, hinting that the meme coin may be gearing up for another powerful move. Breakout From $0.22–$0.24 Marks End Of Consolidation Alpha Crypto Signal, in a recent update, revealed a significant development for Dogecoin, noting that the meme coin has successfully broken out of its long-standing horizontal channel. This channel, which had contained its price between $0.22 and $0.24 for an extended period, had been a key consolidation zone for the asset. This decisive breach of the range confirms a major shift in momentum and signals the end of a prolonged phase of stagnant price action. Related Reading: Dogecoin On Edge — 2.5 Days Remain To Lock In Breakout Springboard The validity of this breakout is further reinforced by a crucial technical indicator: rising volume. As Dogecoin pushed higher, the increased trading volume served as a powerful signal of conviction from the buyers. This strong backing indicates that the move was not a fleeting event but rather a genuine surge of interest, with significant capital flowing into the asset. Following its strong rally, Dogecoin is currently experiencing a healthy and expected pullback from the resistance zone between $0.29 and $0.30. However, this slight retreat is a positive and natural part of a strong uptrend, as it allows the market to consolidate and prevents the rally from becoming overheated. According to the expert, this pullback is presenting a strategic opportunity for traders. Alpha Crypto Signal suggests that any retest of the breakout level, specifically the $0.24 to $0.25 zone, could offer a solid long opportunity. As long as Dogecoin can hold above this crucial zone and maintain its overall bullish structure, the positive momentum from the breakout is expected to continue. Dogecoin Pattern Repeats: History Points To Another Pump In a recent post on X, crypto analyst CryptoELlTES has revealed a compelling observation about Dogecoin’s price history. He asserts that a specific technical pattern is repeating itself on the chart, one that has consistently preceded every major Dogecoin pump in the past. This historical correlation suggests that the current setup is highly significant. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready To Bark Again? Analyst Sees Path To $0.45 According to the analysis, Dogecoin is at the final stage of this “1-2 pattern.” The chart displays the same formation that previously launched the asset into several parabolic moves. Since the market is showing the same bullish behavior that has historically led to explosive growth for the coin, a major upward move could be on the horizon.

52038192,https://timestabloid.com/?p=83887,1758423635,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top 3 Most Trending Altcoins in September and Why This Rising Star Takes the Spotlight,https://timestabloid.com/top-3-most-trending-altcoins-in-september-and-why-this-rising/,"Altcoins are once again at the center of market conversations as traders look beyond Bitcoin for the next big move. September has been unusually active for digital assets, with fresh rallies, community-driven hype, and institutional interest shaping momentum. Among the top names leading the way this month are Dogecoin, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE , the latter of which analysts say could deliver as much as 50x returns in this bull market cycle. Dogecoin Rides Meme Momentum and ETF Speculation Dogecoin continues to prove its staying power in the crypto landscape. Despite being launched as a meme coin, DOGE has built one of the most loyal communities in digital assets. September has brought renewed excitement, as investors speculate about the possibility of a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) coming to U.S. markets. While still in early discussions, the mere prospect of a DOGE ETF has fueled optimism that mainstream institutions could one day have easier access to the meme coin that started it all. Trading around the mid-$0.20s, Dogecoin has shown surprising resilience. Investors are watching closely to see whether ETF speculation and community-driven campaigns can push DOGE higher in the coming weeks. With its unique blend of cultural influence and potential institutional recognition, Dogecoin remains one of the most talked-about altcoins this September. MAGACOIN FINANCE Becomes the Rising Star While Dogecoin and XRP benefit from ETF speculation and established ecosystems, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the breakout rising star of 2025 . Still in its early stages, the project has already attracted thousands of participants into its presale and continues to expand at a remarkable pace. Analysts are now projecting that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 50x returns , echoing the kind of exponential growth seen by early adopters of DOGE and XRP in past cycles. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its ability to capture both community energy and whale participation at the same time. Retail investors are flooding into the presale, while larger holders who previously concentrated on Bitcoin and XRP are diversifying into this new opportunity. With momentum building fast, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being tipped as one of the most promising altcoins of the cycle — not as a rival to established giants, but as a fresh vehicle for those chasing outsized returns. XRP Gains Institutional Momentum With ETF Buzz XRP has also been making significant noise this month. With its market capitalization climbing back above $180 billion, XRP recently overtook several major corporations in valuation, cementing its position as a top-tier crypto asset. The token has consistently traded above the $3 level during September, and optimism continues to grow around the pending launch of an XRP ETF in the United States. According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, the long-anticipated REX-Osprey ETF is likely to receive approval soon, potentially arriving before the end of the month. Such a product would mark a historic milestone for XRP, opening the door for institutional inflows and making it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity service, which powers global cross-border payments, already provides XRP with strong real-world use cases. Combined with the ETF narrative, many analysts see potential targets of $6 or even $13 if bullish momentum continues. Why These Altcoins Dominate September Together, Dogecoin, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE reflect the different dynamics driving today’s altcoin market. Dogecoin shows the power of cultural momentum, reinforced by ETF hype that could one day bring it into the institutional spotlight. XRP combines utility with legitimacy, using Ripple’s payment network to secure real-world adoption while an ETF looms as a potential game changer for liquidity. MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the thrill of early-stage investing, where small stakes can translate into significant gains if growth continues. The common denominator is visibility. In September, each of these projects has managed to capture investor attention in a unique way, shaping narratives that extend beyond price movements alone. Conclusion Altcoins are once again leading the conversation in crypto. Dogecoin continues to ride its meme-powered momentum while investors speculate on the possibility of a DOGE ETF. XRP has captured institutional attention, with its own ETF likely to launch soon, marking a defining moment for its market. And at the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as the rising star , with analysts projecting as much as 50x returns for early investors. Together, these three projects highlight the range of opportunities available in the altcoin market — from cultural icons to institutional plays to breakout newcomers.

Developers are pushing forward with the XLS-86 Firewall , a proposed feature that could slow or block suspicious transactions before they empty accounts. It marks a turning point for investor protection on XRPL, which until now has relied heavily on users safeguarding their own wallets. As this milestone nears, some large XRP holders are also exploring other high-growth opportunities, with MAGACOIN FINANCE emerging as a surprising destination for whales looking to diversify . A New Firewall for XRPL The XLS-86 Firewall is being designed to stop attacks at the transaction level, offering users the ability to control how their funds move. Unlike complex multisignature setups, this system is built to be user-friendly, allowing both individuals and businesses to activate rules without deep technical knowledge. At its core, the firewall introduces two simple but powerful tools: transaction thresholds and time delays. Users will be able to set caps on how much can leave their accounts in a given window or delay large withdrawals for several hours. If hackers compromise a wallet, these restrictions could give the real owner time to react, preventing instant losses. Another key feature is whitelisting, which allows trusted addresses to bypass restrictions. Everyday transactions – like paying a supplier or transferring funds between personal accounts – would remain seamless. The balance between strict protection and practical usability is what makes XLS-86 different from earlier solutions. Why It Matters Now Scams targeting XRP holders have grown more sophisticated, from phishing links to fake airdrops. Just recently, Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz warned about a fraudulent campaign making the rounds online. With billions at stake, the community has been demanding more proactive protections. Up until now, personal responsibility has been the mantra: keep private keys safe, avoid suspicious links, or use cold storage. But these measures still leave gaps, especially for newcomers. Once a wallet is compromised, the XRP Ledger itself offers no built-in defense – funds can vanish in seconds. The proposed firewall could change that dynamic. Instead of leaving users entirely exposed, XRPL would embed a layer of protection into its codebase, giving investors a fighting chance against criminals. For many, this signals a broader philosophical shift: security should be part of the network, not just the responsibility of individuals. Altcoin Contender Captures Whale Attention While XRP developers focus on strengthening defenses, some whales are hedging their bets by entering MAGACOIN FINANCE , a fast-growing presale project that has already made waves in 2025. What makes this move notable is the scale of migration: investors known for holding large amounts of XRP are now channeling capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE, signaling growing confidence in its potential. Unlike traditional presales, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emphasized speed and accessibility, onboarding thousands of users in just weeks. Its model allows whales to secure positions early while still giving retail participants a fair entry point – a balance rarely seen in early-stage crypto ventures. This unique structure has fueled speculation that MAGACOIN FINANCE could rise as one of the most community-driven projects of the current bull cycle. Some analysts even argue that its growth pace is already outpacing rivals in the same stage, making it a top altcoin to watch heading into 2026. A Turning Point for Investor Protection Back in the XRP camp, the XLS-86 Firewall may represent more than just a technical upgrade. If widely adopted, it could serve as a model for how blockchains approach investor safety. Instead of assuming that users will always act flawlessly, the network itself would provide a fallback mechanism. This is a significant shift from the traditional crypto ethos of total self-custody, where responsibility lies entirely with the individual. By embedding security features directly into XRPL, developers are acknowledging the reality that scams remain a persistent threat, and stronger safeguards are needed to encourage wider adoption. Other blockchains are likely watching closely. If XLS-86 proves effective, Ethereum, Solana, and other ecosystems could consider similar tools. The crypto industry has often been criticized for leaving newcomers vulnerable, and innovations like this could help bridge that trust gap. What Comes Next The firewall proposal is still in the development stage, and activation will ultimately depend on community adoption. Importantly, the system will remain optional – users can decide whether to enable the rules based on their own comfort with security. This flexibility could drive widespread adoption, avoiding the pitfalls of overly rigid safeguards. For XRP, the timing is critical. The asset has remained one of the most widely used tokens in global payments but continues to face challenges from scammers targeting its large retail base. By strengthening defenses, XRPL could enhance its reputation as one of the safest blockchains for both individuals and institutions. Conclusion XRP’s planned firewall marks a potential breakthrough in blockchain security, signaling a new era where networks take a more active role in protecting users. If implemented successfully, XLS-86 could set a precedent for the entire industry. At the same time, large XRP investors diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE shows how the bull market is opening doors for projects with rapid adoption and unique community-driven models. Together, these developments highlight the dual story of crypto in 2025 – improving safety for established tokens while creating fresh opportunities for ambitious newcomers.
