Here’s the Estimated Wealth of CZ After the Latest Surge,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bnb-breaks-another-record-heres-the-estimated-wealth-of-cz-after-the-latest-surge/,"A remarkable development has occurred in the cryptocurrency market. According to 8market data, the market value of Binance's native coin, BNB, has reached $141.79 billion. This figure moved BNB to 155th place in the global asset market capitalization rankings, surpassing Intel with a market capitalization of $138.14 billion. According to a June 2024 report by Forbes, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) held approximately 89.1 million BNB at the time. The recent surge in the BNB price, reaching over $1,020, has brought the value of CZ's holdings to approximately $90.88 billion. Related News: Has the Altcoin Season Begun? Here's the Latest Status According to the Index CZ's other known crypto asset portfolio is as follows: SHORT: 3.996 trillion units ($115.68 million) BNB: 958,841 units ($979.33 thousand) SIREN: 1.775 million units ($173.56 thousand) QUQ: 84.934 million units ($144.58 thousand) JANITOR: 50 million units ($80.76 thousand) However, of the cryptocurrencies listed above, only BNB is an asset Zhao willingly owns. The others are memecoins sent by developers to draw attention to CZ.

According to CoinGlass data, a total of $7.93 million worth of XRP positions were liquidated. $7.21 million of this came from long positions and $718,000 from short positions. This brought the daily liquidation imbalance to a record 903%. The XRP price fell from $3.04 to $2.98 during the day, falling below the critical $3 psychological support level. While the $2.90 level is currently being held as support, the market is showing no signs of a strong recovery. The sharp decline was not limited to XRP alone. On the Ethereum (ETH) side, a total of $61.5 million worth of long positions were liquidated, while short losses were limited to $4.14 million. A similar picture was seen for Bitcoin (BTC): $35.1 million was liquidated, $33.1 million of which came from long positions. The higher liquidation rate for long positions compared to short positions may indicate a weakening of buyer appetite in the market. Some analysts suggest that the decline may be due to strategic price pressure from institutional investors rather than a simple correction. Black Swan Capitalist founder Versan Aljarrah and financial writer Jim Willie argue that institutions are holding back the rally to accumulate XRP at its low price. “If it weren’t for these pressures, XRP could have risen to at least $7-$8 from its recent price movements,” Willie said, adding that institutions see XRP as a liquidity tool instead of the US dollar and take long-term positions. *This is not investment advice.

The SHIB coin is starting to gain notice as it appears on Coinbase’s radar. Coinbase already offers a futures product for Shiba Inu, and this step positions the meme coin for consideration as a future ETF. SHIB’s marketing lead claims the coin already has the necessary setup for this, while a market analyst predicts significant price growth. Both agree that momentum for SHIB is picking up now. Related Reading: From $2 Trillion To $400T? CEO Sees Bitcoin Exploding 200x – Here’s More Shiba Inu Enters Coinbase’s ETF Watchlist According to SHIB’s marketing lead, Susie S, the coin has now joined Coinbase’s “ETF Watchlist Club.” This group already includes Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Hedera (HBAR), and XRP. Being named in this group indicates that the Shiba Inu token is gaining more serious attention. Susie S explained that Shiba Inu is in line for spot ETF consideration because Coinbase already has a regulated futures contract called the “1K SHIB Index.” It is essential because it puts SHIB on the same pathway that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) followed before they gained approval for spot ETFs. For the first time, the meme coin now stands in the same conversation as two of the world’s largest cryptocurrencies. She added that while it may be harder for Shiba Inu to launch its own solo ETF immediately, the ETF could be part of a larger product. That product could be something like a “Top 10 Crypto ETF” that bundles together several coins. Market Analyst Sees Massive Potential For SHIB Price Market analyst Heber Mayen also sees a big future for Shiba Inu. Posting a SHIB price chart on X, he stated, “It’s gonna be massive!” His comment reflects the rising attention around Shiba Inu as it becomes more active in trading markets. Mayen explained that SHIB’s popularity on Coinbase’s perpetual markets is a significant indicator. As more traders buy and sell SHIB in these products, the trading volume goes up. This rise in volume can help SHIB meet one of the needs for an ETF to be approved. In other words, the more people trade Shiba Inu now, the stronger the case becomes for a future ETF. Related Reading: FalconX Moves 413K Solana Worth $98M – Impact On SOL Price Currently, Shiba Inu is attracting more leveraged traders, and this ETF activity may be fueling ongoing speculation. Analysts like Mayen argue that momentum is on SHIB’s side as investors seek the next big crypto ETF candidate. The price action and volume activity together create the type of market story that can push Shiba Inu further into the spotlight. Backed by comments from its marketing lead and bullish words from the analyst, the SHIB meme coin could become the next big thing.

What is notable in this rush is the kind of capital that is coming in. Investors with blue-chip assets in their portfolios, such as Cardano (ADA) and Chainlink (LINK), are now pouring money into this new token. The acquisition is an indicator of a changing approach since whales and industry veterans are combining proven projects with new ventures, with more probable upward progress. This is a relevant trend that indicates an increased awareness of the continuously changing market in 2025. ADA and LINK remain large-cap assets that have merged reliability and technological leadership, but their big valuations inherently slow down the exponential growth of their prices. Conversely, presales such as MAGACOIN FINANCE offer the chance to buy at lower prices and wait for exponential gains when liquidity and exchange listings happen. The appeal lies in timing, risk-versus-reward, and the potential for outsized gains that established assets can no longer deliver. Established giants: Cardano and Chainlink hold their ground Cardano is among the most well-known sources of smart contracts, with support for sustainability and security. Their proof-of-stake design has placed it among energy efficiency leaders, and its scaling solutions, named Hydra and rising DeFi partnerships, are expanding its usefulness. To its persistent supporters, ADA stands as a home for technological progress and usage. However, its maturity curbs the hyper-growth that it experienced in earlier years, which then makes some holders venture into more speculative players. On the other hand, Chainlink controls the decentralized oracle space. It has linked blockchains to real-world data, making it essential to decentralized finance, gaming, and Enterprise adoption. New alliances in tokenized assets and integrations on a broader scale shed more light on the continued relevance of LINK. Nonetheless, its billion-dollar market capitalization has ensured that its growth curve is more incremental than exponential. This fact has prompted investors to look beyond its gradual trend to the newer tokens that may repeat the initial success of earlier cycles. The appeal of MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale MAGACOIN FINANCE positions itself as a high-upside, low-cap opportunity that contrasts sharply with the size and stability of ADA and LINK. In presale, investors acquire tokens at entry points designed to reward early adoption. These discounted levels, combined with scarcity-focused tokenomics, give buyers a chance to benefit from appreciation once listings and liquidity expand. The project’s roadmap also plays into its appeal. With planned features in decentralized finance and community governance, MAGACOIN FINANCE seeks to carve out a distinct niche. Whales have taken note of this structure, seeing it as an opportunity to complement their blue-chip holdings with a token that carries higher potential return. The more than $14 million raised so far underscores this confidence. Portfolio diversification in 2025 The influx of ADA and LINK investors into MAGACOIN FINANCE indicates a bigger tendency among portfolio tactics. Blue-chip cryptos are stable, whereas presales generate momentum and new growth opportunities. The combination of the two will form a balanced strategy that is consistent with the realities of the present market. Investors are no longer deciding between safety and opportunity, but rather merging them to ensure optimization. This diversification plan indicates the extent to which the market has evolved. Earlier cycles had concentrated much of the capital on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a few other leading projects. Capital allocation today is increasingly dynamic with institutional adoption, real-world asset tokenization, and the rapid emergence of new platforms. The presale success experienced by MAGACOIN FINANCE underscores the fact that established investors are also prepared to commit to a start-up project when growth opportunities outweigh risks. Conclusion The presale milestone reached by MAGACOIN FINANCE demonstrates the evolving strategies shaping crypto portfolios in 2025. Cardano and Chainlink remain indispensable to the blockchain ecosystem, but their growth curves are steady rather than explosive. By contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers investors an early-entry advantage that may translate into higher returns once listings and liquidity arrive. For whales and retail backers alike, this balance between proven networks and presale opportunities is becoming a defining feature of the next phase in crypto investing.

This could be the beginning of a new tech stack - one in which AI, not humans, becomes the primary developer of applications, according to Dominic Williams, founder of Internet Computer developer Dfinity. Williams argued that while crypto prices remain driven largely by market mechanics - treasury operations, liquidity games and speculation - the underlying technology will eventually force a reckoning in an interview with CoinDesk. “In the long run, markets begin to reflect realities on the ground,” he said. “But as yet you’re not seeing what’s happening with Internet Computer reflected in ICP’s price.” Running AI on-Chain The Internet Computer first demonstrated neural networks running as smart contracts in April last year, starting with image classification and later facial recognition, Williams said. While those were relatively simple models compared to large language models - the kind that power AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini - they were proof of concept: that AI can run natively on a blockchain. No other network has achieved this, Williams pointed out, despite the chatter about “decentralized AI.” Where others rely on off-chain infrastructure like Amazon Web Services, ICP seeks to integrate the full AI development and execution stack on-chain. Williams describes this as “a self-writing internet” - a system where users describe what they want, and an AI delivers it as a working application, hosted directly on Internet Computer. The bigger idea, Williams said, is that AI itself will replace much of today’s developer workflow. Instead of humans writing code, configuring databases and maintaining servers, an AI could spin up applications instantly, update them continuously and ensure resilience through blockchain-based guarantees. This reframes the blockchain not just as a settlement layer for tokens, but as the optimal environment for AI-generated applications. ICP’s design, with features like “reverse gas” - the model where developers pay for the computational costs of their applications, rather than requiring end users to pay a transaction fee - removes the need for firewalls or database migrations that plague traditional infrastructure. “AI is developing these apps hundreds of times faster than humans could,” Williams said. “And because there are no system admins standing by, you need the guardrails only blockchain can provide.” Williams pointed to early hackathons where ordinary people used AI on ICP to build apps: from a crowdsourced pothole-mapping platform, to a tool for generating wills and health directives. The vision is that such tools could proliferate in the millions. Entrepreneurs, small businesses and even NGOs could create customized apps without technical expertise, paying for usage with fiat while crypto tokens underpin the system behind the scenes. Price Action Still Lagging Despite these developments, the ICP token has yet to see sustained momentum. It briefly rallied when AI integrations were announced last year, but has since traded more in line with broader market sentiment than with user adoption. Williams accepts this disconnect but predicts that markets may catch up very soon. “This could be the first time Web3 actually outcompetes Web2 technologically, without a token incentive in sight,” Williams said. “The shock will be when people realize they can just talk to an AI, and a blockchain app appears at a URL.”",Tech|Internet Computer|AI|News,EN,0,0,MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|ICP|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-20 21:00:00

He detailed how the group is using increasingly sophisticated tactics to gain access to companies. Operatives Are Exploiting Hiring Process CZ shared his concerns via a September 18 X post, describing the hackers as “advanced, creative, and patient.” He explained how the most common method used by these individuals involves posing as job candidates to secure roles in companies, particularly in developer, security, and finance positions, giving them a “foot in the door.” In other cases, the group poses as employers and attempts to interview staff, using the process to distribute malware. Zhao noted that during these sessions, the attackers often claim there is a problem with Zoom and then send a link to an “update” carrying a virus, or they provide coding questions followed by “sample code” embedded with malware. Another tactic involves pretending to be users who file customer support requests containing malicious links. CZ added that hackers also pay or bribe employees and hired vendors to gain access to data, pointing to a recent case in India where an outsourcing service was compromised, resulting in the leak of data from a major U.S. exchange and losses exceeding $400 million. This alert follows the release of a report by cybersecurity group Security Alliance (SEAL), profiling over 60 impostors linked to North Korean operations. The report says that these attackers built fake LinkedIn profiles, set up GitHub portfolios, and used forged government IDs to make their applications look real. Shift in Methods North Korean hackers have always been a major threat in the crypto industry, with over $1.3 billion worth of assets stolen in 2024 alone. Traditionally, they have relied on phishing, malware, and private key compromises to loot from exchanges. However, recent reports suggest they are moving towards targeting human resources. A separate investigation by ZachXBT also uncovered how a small DPRK team of five IT workers operated over 30 fake identities at crypto firms. Elsewhere, Coinbase also recently reported a similar threat from these bad actors. The exchange shared that they are increasingly targeting their remote worker policy to infiltrate sensitive systems. CEO Brian Armstrong has since announced changes to the company’s internal security protocols, including mandatory in-person onboarding in the U.S., fingerprinting, and U.S. citizenship requirements for employees with system-level access. The exchange also introduced stricter interview procedures, such as requiring cameras to remain on, to prevent impersonation and AI-assisted coaching. In light of the growing threat to the job market, CZ has urged crypto platforms to train their employees not to download files and to screen potential candidates carefully.

For a lot of newer players, this progress seems absolutely impossible to achieve. Which is why copy trading has become so big: It lets beginners mimic the orders of professional traders, allowing them to benefit from and even learn from their expertise without having to spend years honing it. For beginners, copy trading is changing the game in how consumers participate in the market, but it’s not the only path to potential growth. For presale options, demand is also skyrocketing. And through them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has stood out most and attracted whales as well as early retail investors. Understanding the Appeal of Copy Trading The fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading can mean that charts change dramatically from one minute to the next, and news items that ignite a “fear of missing out” among ordinary investors one day can send prices plunging the other way overnight. For a lot of newer players, this progress seems absolutely impossible to achieve. Which is why copy trading has become so big: It lets beginners mimic the orders of professional traders, allowing them to benefit from and even learn from their expertise without having to spend years honing it. For beginners, copy trading is changing the game in how consumers participate in the market, but it’s not the only path to potential growth. For presale options, demand is also skyrocketing. And through them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has stood out most and attracted whales as well as early retail investors. At its most basic level, copy trading is simple. An investor chooses a trader whose trading record they’d like to mimic publicly, connects their account through a copy trading platform and their account will then automatically replicate all the trades of that professional. If the trader is buying Bitcoin, the investor’s account buys Bitcoin. The trader gets profits, and so does the investor. This configuration allows those new to the market the opportunity to take advantage of professional strategies without learning technical analysis overnight. That is particularly true in crypto, where volatility breeds caution even among the most experienced traders. Beginners can have more confidence in assuming trades that they’d otherwise shy away from by replicating someone who already has experience. Benefits That Attract Newcomers One of the most significant advantages of copy trading is that it allows learning through participation. Watching trades unfold in real time helps beginners understand why certain moves are made, what patterns traders look for, and how risk is managed. Over time, this exposure can help newcomers develop their own style. Another benefit is time. Many beginners don’t have the hours each day to study charts, read research, or track every news update. Copy trading lets them participate in the market passively while still learning on the side. There’s also the potential to generate consistent results if the chosen trader has a reliable record. While there are no guarantees, aligning with a skilled strategist gives beginners a better chance than guessing on their own. The Risks That Must Be Managed Despite the appeal, copy trading carries real risks. The most obvious is over-reliance. Just because a trader has performed well in the past doesn’t mean they will continue to do so indefinitely. Market conditions change, and even professionals face drawdowns. There are also platform fees, performance charges, and the issue of slippage—when large numbers of people copy the same trader, execution prices can differ. This means returns may not precisely match those of the lead trader. Finally, beginners may find themselves copying strategies that involve risk levels far beyond their comfort zone. Some traders thrive on high leverage, which can lead to big wins but also wipeouts. Without caution, following the wrong profile can cause losses just as quickly as gains. An Alternative for Beginners While many newcomers are exploring copy trading, others are turning their attention to early presales as an alternative route into the market. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the names dominating the discussion. Forecasts suggest it could deliver up to 22,000% ROI by 2025, putting it in the spotlight as a potential breakout candidate for the next bull cycle. The presale is attracting both whale inflows and retail demand, with investors eager to secure allocations before wider listings. Adding to the urgency, early buyers can unlock a 50% EXTRA BONUS with the code PATRIOT50X, effectively boosting their positions. With phases selling out quickly, this presale highlights the other side of beginner strategy—where instead of copying someone else’s trades, investors position themselves early in projects with high growth potential. How To Use Copy Trading Wisely For those who do choose copy trading, discipline is essential. Beginners should avoid putting all their capital into a single trader. Spreading allocations across several different profiles reduces the risk of one poor performance wiping out an account. Monitoring results regularly is also essential. If a trader suddenly changes strategies or starts chasing risky bets, it may be time to reduce exposure. Having personal stop-loss settings in place adds another layer of control, ensuring losses don’t spiral out of hand. Ultimately, copy trading works best as part of a broader strategy. Beginners can combine it with long-term holdings in established assets, small positions in promising presales, and gradual self-education. Over time, many investors evolve from pure copy trading into building their own independent strategies. Conclusion Copy trading has given beginners a way to step into crypto without feeling overwhelmed, offering the chance to profit while learning from experienced traders. But like any tool, it comes with risks that require careful management. Presale opportunities such as MAGACOIN FINANCE provide another powerful option, letting investors capture upside by entering early before the broader market catches on. For new participants in crypto, the key is balance: combining education, security, and disciplined allocation to find a strategy that fits both goals and risk tolerance.

These assets are held by ETFs, public companies, governments, private companies, exchanges, and DeFi protocols. ETFs and public companies, in particular, make up the largest portion of the total. Related News: Two Whales Dumped This Altcoin: Sold in Bulk According to the data, 332 institutions currently hold Bitcoin reserves, including 192 public companies, 44 ETFs or funds, 68 private companies, 13 governments, 11 DeFi protocols, and 4 exchanges/custodians. After accounting for the ~1.1 million BTC held by Satoshi Nakamoto and the 2.3–3.7 million BTC thought to be missing, the 3.74 million BTC held by institutions equates to approximately 22.6%–24.7% of the available supply. The country with the largest Bitcoin holdings is the US (118), followed by Canada (43), the UK (21), Japan (12), and Hong Kong (12). The amount of Bitcoin held by institutions has increased significantly, particularly after the approval of cryptocurrency-holding ETFs in the US and the rise in the number of digital asset treasury companies. *This is not investment advice.

52029718,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=813933,1758404857,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52029718.jpeg,Wall Street has gained $16 trillion this year despite global wars and political instability,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wall-streets-16-trillion-rally-powers-on/,"Wall Street has gained over $16 trillion in market value this year, even as the rest of the world looks like a war room. That rally has come while expected volatility in US stocks is sitting near one-year lows, and people keep throwing money at crypto, meme stocks, and anything that looks like it might pump. Oil prices are hovering near the cheapest levels seen in four years, and nobody seems to care that multiple wars are boiling around the globe. According to Bloomberg, Russia has flown drones into NATO airspace, Israel is deep into its assault on Gaza, and China keeps circling Taiwan’s coastline. Ukraine is still under siege, Japan’s government is barely standing, and France is dealing with yet another crisis. Donald Trump, back in the White House, is already swinging tariffs at everyone. He’s leading a messy trade war against allies and rivals with zero concern for who’s next. But none of that has broken the mood on Wall Street. Investors are still pouring in, eyes locked on profits instead of politics. Markets ride on earnings while ignoring bombs The general investor rule right now is this: if the geopolitical chaos doesn’t hit numbers, it doesn’t exist. That’s how Helen Jewell, chief investment officer of EMEA fundamental equities at BlackRock, framed it. “We’re very focused on geopolitical risks,” she said, “but as an investor you’ve got to look at how you can quantify that. It is the implication on consumers and currency because they are the things that impact company earnings.” So far, the impact hasn’t come. US corporate earnings are still solid. There’s no recession, and the Fed’s latest interest-rate cut has only boosted the mood. But it wouldn’t take much for that to flip. If oil prices suddenly spike, or if a major nation’s bonds collapse, the whole rally could fall apart. That’s what happened in 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine and crude prices exploded. Wall Street dropped fast. France and Japan are also looking shaky. Their governments are weak, and their bond markets are vulnerable. That could hurt broader equity indexes if something breaks. But for now, investors are pretending those problems are far away. Guillaume Jaisson, strategist at Goldman Sachs, said flat out: “Little has been priced into stocks on geopolitical risks.” He warned that US stocks are very expensive, and Europe’s not cheap either. Political chaos already hits global stocks Trump’s policy moves are already leaving bruises. In April, he floated the highest tariffs in a century, questioned the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency, and triggered a selloff in Treasuries. The S&P 500 dropped nearly 20% from its high. It wasn’t just talk — investors ran for cover, and fast. Other countries haven’t been spared. The CAC 40 in France dropped over 3% in just two days after Francois Bayrou called for a vote of confidence over a budget fight. Foreign investors pulled $473 million from Indonesia’s stock market this month after violent protests and a surprise replacement of the finance minister. In Japan, investors got spooked again after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced he’d step down. These dips haven’t lasted long, though. Traders keep betting that central banks and governments will step in to stop serious damage. But Jaisson warned that if there’s a rise in uncertainty, markets could flip from treating bad news as good news to just bad news being bad. With valuations already stretched, there’s almost no room to mess up. Viktor Shvets, global strategist at Macquarie, said investors still don’t know how to react to global conflict. “Equity investors are hopeless about geopolitics; since the Vietnam War, it hasn’t had an impact,” he said. Instead of worrying about wars, they focus on things they can measure: profits, household spending, and currency movements. Still, the fallout is real. Since French President Emmanuel Macron called a snap election in June 2024, the CAC 40 has lagged behind global peers, missing out on gains fueled by AI hype and economic growth elsewhere. The FTSE 100 in the UK has also underperformed in dollar terms ever since the Brexit referendum in 2016. Now, more investors are getting nervous. A Bank of America survey showed that geopolitical risk is now rated the highest since last December in fund managers’ risk rankings. That fear is showing up in the market. A UBS basket of defense-linked stocks is up over 100% this year, and gold is hitting record highs, though that’s also because the dollar is slipping. But the real risk is still out there. Tim Murray, capital markets strategist at T. Rowe Price, warned that if these conflicts actually hit the real economy, stocks could crash hard. “A big negative economic surprise, be it politically driven or not, could mean a much bigger selloff than normal given the current valuations,” he said.

Meanwhile, more and more investors are considering Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Now available in presale for a meager $0.035, MUTM is catching the eye with its DeFi-focused lending and borrowing protocol, designed with real-world use case in mind. While ADA investors get ready for volatility, MUTM holders are watching for a potential 44x run, making it one of the hottest tokens of the next cycle. Cardano Sees Market Volatility as Investors Keep Tabs on Progress Cardano (ADA) is currently at $0.9148. The token has experienced slight movements amid widespread market fluctuation, and the performance of the price in the future hinges on network activity, technological advancement, as well as investor attitude. ADA enjoys a friendly community and regular updates, but professionals caution that it could retrace as market attitude becomes negative. In the meantime, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining attention for its innovative DeFi protocol, offering an alternative path to expansion compared to ADA. Mutuum Finance is giving investors the type of early-stage appreciation that ADA investors can never experience again. With capital seeking the next behemoth to lift off, Mutuum Finance is becoming the coin to keep an eye on. Mutuum Finance Presale FOMO Mutuum Finance provides investors the opportunity to be among the first to adopt the project and invest in tokens at much lower prices than what they will be required to pay once the project has been launched. At presale Phase 6, priced at $0.035 per MUTM, the token will be sold at Phase 7 at $0.04. Presale has been successful with over $16.01 million raised and over 16,410 token holders, a sign of positive investor sentiment and confidence in the market. As another layer of security, Mutuum Finance has introduced an official Bug Bounty Program in conjunction with CertiK that assures up to $50,000 USDT in rewards. Available to everyone, the program invites white-hat hackers, developers, and researchers to scan the codebase for any potential flaws. The rewards are tiered according to severity level, so even the low-level bugs get addressed before release. The move is just one sign of Mutuum’s commitment to investor protection, transparency, and trust. MUTM is a two-layer hybrid lending protocol, with Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models, to ensure ultimate flexibility. The P2C model is used to enable the contracts to monitor the market round-the-clock so that interest rates can be decided. It is designed such that investors will earn passive income and lenders will lend at the lowest interest rates and the contracts will execute the transaction automatically. The P2P model enables direct real-time interaction between lenders and borrowers without an intermediary. The more dynamic of the two enables riskier products such as meme coins and offers freedom and efficiency in a trustless setting. For providing timely and accurate prices, Mutuum Finance utilizes Chainlink oracles that aggregate rates of high-cap tokens such as USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, combined feeds, and on-chain data feeds are also utilized for providing security in a volatile market. The robust pricing foundation is utilized in stable collateral management, liquidations, and risk analysis for guaranteeing the stability and efficiency of the protocol under any condition. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a growth-altcoin in DeFi and Cardano (ADA) looms over market volatility. Phase 6 presale tokens cost $0.035, before rising to $0.04 in Phase 7. The project has already reached $16.01M raised and 16,410+ token holders, showcasing strong market trust. With a $50K CertiK bug bounty, a P2C/P2P lending protocol, and Chainlink-based oracle pricing, MUTM provides security, agility, and scalable DeFi infrastructure.

Notably, the premier cryptocurrency continues to trade within the $115,000 price region after earlier price gains on Thursday were followed by a correction of equal measure. SOPR Ratio Trends Up: Market Signals Point To New Bitcoin Rally In a QuickTake post on September 19, PelinayPA shares some potential insights into Bitcoin’s future trajectory based on the latest Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) developments. For context, the SOPR is an on-chain metric that reflects whether Bitcoin investors are selling their coins at a profit or a loss. However, this metric can also be used to gauge the balance of profitability between long-term holders and short-term holders when we compare the SOPR Ratios of both parties, i.e, LTH/STH SOPR. When the ratio is high (LTH > STH), it indicates that seasoned investors are more profitable, often signaling the beginning or continuation of a sustainable bull market. Conversely, when the ratio is low (LTH In the present market, the LTH/STH SOPR ratio is balanced but moving upward, a sign that long-term holders are regaining their advantage. PelinayPA suggests this could mark the early stages of a new bull cycle, with indicators pointing to $120,000 as the next major upside technical target. Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Remains High In other news, US-based institutions and whales continue to accumulate substantial levels of Bitcoin regardless of price movements. Market analyst Darkfost reports that Coinbase Premium has turned consistently positive since April, reflecting stronger institutional demand from US traders compared to entities on other trading platforms, such as Binance.

The Commerce Ministry released a statement saying Beijing’s stance had not changed. “China’s position on TikTok is clear: The Chinese government respects the wishes of the enterprise, and welcomes it to carry out commercial negotiations in accordance with market rules to reach a solution compliant with China’s laws and regulations, and strikes a balance of interests,” the ministry said. The comments come after Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by phone on Friday. The outcome of the discussions is seen as important not just for TikTok but also for broader trade talks. The short video app has 170 million users in the U.S., and its fate is linked to potential compromises in other areas such as agriculture and aviation, as the world’s two largest economies seek to move beyond their tariff standoff. The Commerce Ministry urged Washington to match China’s efforts “It is hoped that the U.S. side will work towards the same goal as China, earnestly fulfil its corresponding commitments, and provide an open, fair, equitable and non-discriminatory business environment for the continued operation of Chinese enterprises in the U.S., including TikTok ,” the statement said. Earlier in the week, officials from both nations reached a framework agreement during meetings in Madrid. Chinese state media described the outcome as a “win-win,” while pledging to review TikTok’s technology exports and licensing of intellectual property. That arrangement cleared one of the hurdles set by U.S. lawmakers. Congress had mandated that TikTok be blocked in the United States by January 2025 unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, divested its American operations. Trump extended the divestiture deadline until December 16. He Yadong, a spokesperson for the Commerce Ministry, repeated Beijing’s call for the U.S. to lower barriers for Chinese companies when asked about what China had gained from the Madrid talks. A new deal would put Americans in control of TikTok According to the White House , the new deal will give Americans the majority stake in TikTok’s U.S. operations. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News on Saturday that six of the seven seats on TikTok’s board would go to American representatives, and the platform’s algorithm would also be controlled in the United States. “The final deal will be signed in the coming days,” Leavitt said. She noted that American appointees to the board would have experience in national security and cybersecurity. ByteDance, which will select the remaining board member, will not have access to the security committee. Talks in Madrid earlier in the week, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, produced the outline of this agreement. Details have not been made public. Trump and Xi gave their approval during their phone call on Friday. Under the plan, ByteDance will keep less than a 20 percent stake in TikTok. New investors will include Oracle Corp., venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, and Silver Lake Management LLC, a private equity firm, a senior White House official said. Oracle will serve as TikTok’s security partner to make sure the app meets U.S. standards. The official explained that data from American users will be stored in the U.S. and kept out of reach of Chinese authorities. Leavitt stressed that most of the conditions had already been set. “So all of those details have already been agreed upon, now we just need this deal to be signed and that will be happening, I anticipate, in the coming days,” she said.

This massive jump was reported by Forge Global, a firm that tracks private market investments. Three years after Sam Altman dropped ChatGPT into the world, this is where things stand. Altogether, the seven companies have multiplied their value four times over since late 2022, which was when ChatGPT hit the market and everything changed. Forge’s figures are built from actual private trading, funding rounds, and investor tender offers, not guesses. And this number isn’t slowing down. Elon Musk’s xAI is raising $10 billion at a $200 billion valuation, up from $150 billion just a few months ago. The demand for anything AI-related is still insane. It’s not just pumping the public market, where names like Oracle, Broadcom, and Nvidia are flying—it’s setting off an arms race in the private world too. AI pushes OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI into the top tier Forge says OpenAI is sitting at $324 billion, the highest of the pack. Right behind is Anthropic at $178 billion, and then xAI with $90 billion. Those three are all chasing the same thing, big AI language models, and they’re fighting not just each other but also Google and Meta. They’re still private companies, but their influence is public as hell. Databricks is also on the list, now valued at $100 billion. That’s thanks to the company’s AI-first push in data analytics. Musk’s other giant, SpaceX, has ballooned to $456 billion, making it the second-biggest name after OpenAI. Stripe holds a $92 billion tag, and defense tech startup Anduril rounds it out with $53 billion. That last one is moving so much money into military-grade AI that Forge had to create a new defense investment fund just to keep up. AI capital flood keeps firms private and disrupts public trading Forge CEO Kelly Rodriques told reporters this isn’t a bubble of hot air. “We’ve not seen this in the private market ever,” he said. “Companies that are growing at 100%, 200%, 300% on numbers that are already pretty big.” He’s not alone in that view. Forge also tracked that 19 AI companies have pulled in $65 billion so far in 2025, making up 77% of all private-market capital. With that kind of cash, none of these players need to go public anytime soon. Rodriques added, “If these stocks are liquid and have access to as much capital as they can get, regulation is probably the only thing stopping them from staying private for as long as they want.” Still, the effect on public markets is obvious. Oracle’s stock shot up 36% in one day after reporting a huge deal with OpenAI. Broadcom also signed its own massive agreement with Sam’s team. Microsoft’s bet on OpenAI keeps paying off. Google, Meta, Amazon—they’ve all jacked up their infrastructure spending plans to handle what’s coming. Sam isn’t blind to how wild it’s gotten. At a private dinner with reporters in San Francisco, he called the valuations “insane” and straight-up admitted, “we are in a bubble.” But that didn’t stop him from revealing OpenAI’s next play. “You should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on datacenter construction,” he said. “We will spend maybe more aggressively than any company who’s ever spent on anything… because we just have this very deep belief in what we’re seeing.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",Tech|SpaceX|Tesla,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-20 22:10:13

As analysts debate whether this momentum could soon carry the token toward fresh all-time highs, some investors are already looking elsewhere for opportunities with even greater upside. One name being discussed in presale circles is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has quickly gained traction as a potential outperformer heading into 2025. Institutional Demand Builds Around XRP In recent months, XRP has gained strong backing from institutions diversifying their crypto holdings. Companies are no longer focused solely on Bitcoin; instead, they are building baskets of assets that include XRP, Ethereum, and other major tokens. This marks a significant shift in strategy, where treasuries are being treated more like balanced portfolios than single-asset bets. One high-profile example came when Amber International Holdings revealed a $100 million plan to build a diversified digital asset reserve, including a sizable XRP allocation. Market observers say this type of adoption underscores growing confidence in XRP’s role as a settlement and liquidity tool for global payments. Price Targets and Market Outlook The question now is how far XRP can go in the short term. Technical analysts point out that the $3 level has been a key resistance point, and breaking it decisively could pave the way toward $3.50 or even $4 in the coming months. Bullish momentum has been supported by rising trading volume, growing open interest in futures contracts, and steady inflows into XRP-focused investment products. On the other hand, skeptics warn that XRP has historically struggled to sustain rallies once euphoria builds. Regulatory clarity has improved, but lingering uncertainty around how various jurisdictions treat tokens tied to payment networks could still affect sentiment. As a result, analysts see both risk and reward on the horizon. A New Presale Capturing Attention While XRP remains in the spotlight, presale investors are increasingly discussing MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project has become one of the fastest-growing opportunities of 2025, with forecasts suggesting it could deliver as much as 22,000% ROI. Early inflows from whales have already positioned it as a contender for the next bull cycle, and retail interest is surging as presale phases sell out. To add to the momentum, early participants can unlock a 50% EXTRA BONUS by using the code PATRIOT50X, effectively increasing their allocation before entry costs rise. For many, the combination of whale activity, strong community backing, and an ambitious roadmap makes it one of the most attractive presales currently available. Investors who believe XRP will rally still see MAGACOIN FINANCE as a way to diversify with potentially higher upside. The Broader Market Context XRP’s rally comes at a time when overall sentiment in crypto has improved. Bitcoin has stabilized above $115,000, Ethereum is gaining strength ahead of potential ETF inflows, and altcoins are drawing renewed interest. Analysts believe XRP could benefit from this broader environment, especially as traders look for assets with proven utility in cross-border payments. The positive backdrop also helps presales. When confidence in the market grows, investors are more willing to commit capital to early-stage projects. This creates a cycle where strong demand fuels faster sellouts, reinforcing bullish expectations. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been a prime example of this trend in 2025, as each phase of its presale has accelerated more quickly than the last. Long-Term Implications for XRP Looking further ahead, XRP’s success depends on whether financial institutions continue to integrate it into their settlement systems. Partnerships with banks, payment processors, and fintech platforms could drive adoption beyond speculation, giving XRP a stronger role in the global economy. If adoption keeps rising, analysts argue the token could eventually challenge its previous all-time highs above $3.80 and set new records. At the same time, competition is fierce. Other networks are working on faster and cheaper payment rails, which means XRP must continue innovating to maintain its advantage. Investors watching the long-term picture will be focused not only on price charts but also on adoption metrics and institutional traction. Conclusion XRP is once again proving its resilience, with price action and institutional interest suggesting that a rally could extend in the months ahead. Yet in presale circles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly being seen as a project with even greater potential, offering investors a chance to secure allocations before mainstream awareness drives valuations higher. Together, these dynamics show how 2025 could be a defining year for both established tokens and ambitious newcomers.

That kind of milestone reminds traders that explosive wins are still alive and well in the meme-driven side of crypto. In fact, the hunt for the next 1000x meme coin has never been louder, with retail investors and seasoned traders glued to presale buzz, community hype, and early-entry opportunities. MoonBull is one of those projects standing at the edge of the spotlight. With its whitelist model, elite staking rewards, and secret token drops, it’s not just a meme coin—it’s a culture play designed for crypto fans who don’t want to miss the next moonshot. Early insiders get the first swing at allocations, while the wider crowd has to wait for doors to crack open. That difference matters when prices are climbing by the second. MoonBull: The Best 1000x Meme Coin Project Of 2025 MoonBull ($MOBU) doesn’t waste time pretending to be just another random meme coin. It’s engineered as an Ethereum-based token with a built-in system of rewards, secret token drops, and tightly capped supply. The team designed it to keep things spicy from the jump: Stage One opens a presale window where insiders get early access at the lowest price possible. Those who whitelist receive the exact launch date ahead of everyone else, meaning they can jump in before the floodgates open. Here’s the kicker: entry to Stage One isn’t limited to whitelist members. Anyone can join when it officially launches. But only those who whitelist ahead of time get that exclusive notification with the date and time. In a market where seconds can equal serious gains, this isn’t just a bonus—it’s the edge that separates casual buyers from sharp players. What sets MoonBull apart is how it leans into community frenzy while keeping a backbone of real structure. Whitelist users don’t just get tokens; they unlock elite staking rewards, secret bonuses, and whispered hints about what’s next. That “what’s next” part is the most exciting, because the roadmap isn’t fully revealed. It’s a shadow launch that gives insiders the thrill of being in on something that most people don’t even know exists yet. Analysts already call MoonBull one of the best 1000x meme coin projects 2025 because it blends scarcity, community, and secrecy into one. With MoonBull’s whitelist growth potential climbing daily, its early narrative already positions it as a viral meme coin with legs. Add in the fact that it’s built on Ethereum for reliability and integration, and the project doesn’t just look fun—it looks sustainable in a space where most meme coins burn out. Between exclusive rewards, 1000x cryptos, trending meme coins, and whitelists now, and presales that vanish in seconds, MoonBull has become the one name degens are whispering about nonstop. Neiro: Meme Culture Meets Market Wildcards While MoonBull runs on exclusivity and careful staging, Neiro has taken a different route. It launched as a meme-heavy project rooted in internet culture, leaning hard into viral Twitter and TikTok trends. Its branding is edgy, playful, and designed to make people laugh. But that humor hides a real engine: a massive community that rallies behind every pump, dip, and rumor. Neiro doesn’t operate on capped supply windows like MoonBull. Instead, its strength lies in sheer exposure. Every meme, video, and share fuels a larger snowball effect that keeps new traders curious. It thrives in chaos. The volatility is wild, but that’s part of the draw. Traders aren’t looking for stability—they’re chasing that one chart that looks like it’ll never stop going up. Still, there’s risk. Neiro doesn’t have the same insider whitelist opportunities or elite staking structures. It lives and dies by its community’s energy. When the hype is hot, it’s hotter than almost any other meme coin. But when attention drifts, holders can find themselves waiting out long dry spells. That unpredictability keeps it exciting but also makes it a tougher hold for those who want a more structured 1000x meme coin. Banana For Scale: The OG Meme Coin Energy Banana For Scale came out swinging as a meme-first project, inspired by one of the internet’s oldest and funniest measuring jokes. It’s absurd, and that’s the point. Its marketing plays off randomness, leaning into nostalgia and internet culture that Gen Z and Millennials both recognize. The coin’s strength isn’t in utility—it’s in the viral power of something silly that everybody gets. This project thrives on inside jokes. The more you understand the meme, the funnier it becomes. That humor builds community because people feel like they’re part of an inside club. Banana For Scale doesn’t try to overpromise. It’s not offering secret staking rewards or a roadmap of exclusive token drops. Instead, it banks on one thing: making crypto fun again. Price action has reflected that. At its peak moments, Banana For Scale has rallied on nothing but memes and word-of-mouth. For a while, it even pulled traders away from more structured projects simply because it was fun. That energy is what keeps it on the list of potential 1000x meme coin contenders. After all, meme coins are often less about the tech and more about the energy. Final Thoughts Based on the research and market trends, MoonBull, Neiro, and Banana For Scale each bring something unique to the meme coin table. Neiro thrives on constant internet humor, Banana For Scale leans into old-school meme culture, and MoonBull combines exclusivity with Ethereum’s reliability. Among them, MoonBull stands out for its structure, scarcity, and promise of exclusive insider perks. It has already earned a spot among the best 1000x meme coin projects 2025. Traders who want early access, secret rewards, and the thrill of being in before the crowd need to pay attention now. Join the MoonBull whitelist now.

A 1000x meme coin is a cryptocurrency that has the potential to multiply an investor’s entry value by one thousand times, usually driven by hype, memes, and early-entry momentum. Why Is MoonBull Called One Of The Best 1000x Meme Coin Projects 2025? MoonBull is recognized as one of the best due to its whitelist growth potential, capped supply, elite staking rewards, and presale exclusivity on Ethereum. How Does MoonBull’s Whitelist Work? Whitelisting lets users register their email for early access. Members receive launch details ahead of the public, giving them the edge to buy at the lowest price. Is Neiro Or Banana For Scale A Safer Bet Than MoonBull? Both have potential, but they rely heavily on hype. MoonBull blends meme frenzy with Ethereum-based security, making it the stronger option for those seeking structure and exclusivity. How Can Someone Join The MoonBull Presale? Entering the presale is simple: submit an email to the encrypted whitelist form. Once confirmed, details about the Stage One presale arrive before anyone else.

After holding steady in the early hours, SHIB faced consistent selling pressure, pushing the price downward. Source: Coinmarketcap Shiba Inu (SHIB) is drawing renewed attention after popular community member Heber Mayen suggested the token is preparing for an explosive breakout. In a recent post, Mayen highlighted that Shiba Inu’s one-month price chart is showing a 3.65% gain over the past 30 days to $0.00001345. The asset has been consolidating within a descending triangle pattern, which has historically signaled major price movements once the pattern reaches its end. According to Mayen’s analysis, Shiba Inu is nearing the extreme low point of its triangle structure. This technical setup suggests a decisive move is imminent. He expressed confidence in a bullish breakout, supported by strong momentum indicators Is Shiba Inu ATH Incoming? Community analyst Shib Spain also echoed a bullish stance. He suggested Shiba Inu is consolidating within the $0.00001270 to $0.00001347 support range. He anticipates a rebound from this level, which could provide the base for a strong uptrend. If sustained, this momentum might help Shiba Inu challenge previous price barriers. Source: X While Mayen refrained from setting a specific price target or timeline, Shib Spain went further in his outlook. To achieve this, Shiba Inu would need to surge by 568% from its current level to surpass its October 2021 peak of $0.00008845. Such a move would mark a significant recovery and reaffirm SHIB’s potential as a high-volatility meme token capable of rapid rallies under favorable market conditions. SHIB Consolidates as Indicators Show Neutral Momentum The daily SHIB shows that price action has entered a period of consolidation after a recent upward move. Price candles reveal that SHIB has been fluctuating between approximately $0.00001250 and $0.00001360 over the last sessions, repeatedly failing to break above the $0.00001400 resistance. SHIB/USD price chart, Source: TradingView The MACD is showing a bullish signal, as the blue MACD line has crossed above the orange signal line, supported by rising green histogram bars that reflect strengthening upward momentum.

This development comes amid a rather volatile moment as LINK prices have declined by almost 5% in the past day following a double price rejection at the $24.80 region. Related Reading: Chainlink Primed For Takeoff: Liquidity Sweep Strengthens Bullish Outlook LINK Bulls Face Key Test At $25 Before Potential Run To $30 In an X post on September 19, Martinez shares an in-depth technical analysis highlighting that Chainlink (LINK) is approaching a decisive moment, having previously tested the $25 resistance zone, a price point crucial to the next bullish leg of the altcoin. Notably, Martinez’s analysis also suggests that LINK is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle, with volatility compressing ahead of what could be a significant breakout. At press time, LINK trades around $23.60, just below the crucial $24.80–$25 zone, which aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. The renowned analyst notes that clearing this barrier could unlock the path toward $27.85, the 1.0 Fibonacci extension, before LINK sets its sights on the $30.12 target (1.272 Fibonacci level). Beyond that, the altcoin could also seize a potential move toward $31.39, if bullish momentum continues. Meanwhile, the symmetrical triangle pattern indicates a period of indecision between buyers and sellers, but as the price action coils tighter near the apex, the likelihood of a breakout increases. If current market demand intensifies under this condition, the $25 breakout could act as the ignition point for a larger rally. However, failure to breach resistance could send LINK back to lower support levels around $23.30 (0.382 Fib) before attempting another breakout. In a bearish case, LINK could break below the symmetrical triangle, with potential support zones set around or even $22.30 (0.236 Fib) or $20.85 (0).

This negative performance only underlines the struggles of LINK in the past month, during which it declined by 11.30%. Meanwhile, recent information shared by Coin Bureau indicates Chainlink ($LINK) may be on the verge of a supply shock as exchange balances have dropped to their lowest levels since 2022. This sharp decline signals that holders are moving coins off exchanges, reducing immediate sell pressure and tightening available supply. At the same time, Martinez also reports that whale activity has surged, with nearly 2 million LINK accumulated in the last 48 hours, underscoring strong confidence from large investors. The combination of reduced exchange liquidity and aggressive whale accumulation is often a precursor to a sharp, significant rally, as demand outpaces available supply.

WeRide said it will work with Grab Holdings Ltd of Singapore to provide autonomous rides for users travelling on two authorized routes in the Punggol neighbourhood. Pony AI outlined a parallel push with ComfortDelGro. The companies aim to start service within the next several months. The move positions Singapore as a key hub for driverless transport in Southeast Asia. Singapore’s Land Transport Authority said its route will cover 12 kilometres in Punggol. WeRide and Grab will operate vehicles along 10km and 12km routes, matching the government’s approved routes for trials. Singapore positions itself as a hub for robotaxi deployment The announcements follow a June update from the Ministry of Transport of Singapore. This particular update suggested that the government intends to introduce autonomous vehicles across public housing estates by year-end and integrate the technology within the national public transport system. Chinese autonomous-driving firms are also pushing abroad. US-listed Pony AI and WeRide, along with Baidu’s Apollo Go, are pressing across Europe, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Baidu Inc. is preparing to launch Apollo Go in Malaysia and Singapore as soon as this year, according to an earlier report by Bloomberg. Tesla Robotaxi Pilot draws scrutiny after three crashes in Austin Meanwhile, in the United States, Tesla’s early data on its own self-driving pilot is drawing attention. A crash report filed with federal regulators lists three collisions tied to the Tesla robotaxi program, only 10 days after the pilot began in Austin, Texas. Tesla withheld much of the detailed data in the filing, citing proprietary information. The fleet, made up of about a dozen cars, had covered up to 7,000 miles in total, according to figures cited in the filing. It remains unclear exactly the number of miles the cars travelled during Tesla’s July 23 earnings call. Executives said the vehicles had travelled 7,000 miles, which could reflect the initial 30 days or only the miles recorded between June 22 and June 30. Tesla’s Austin vehicles are not fully autonomous and require a trained driver to sit in the front seat. The company refers to it as a “safety monitor.” Similar to a driving instructor, that person holds a safety stop button, can reach the steering wheel, and is the legally responsible driver available to assume control if the system does not function normally. A program with a human safety driver on board would typically be expected to experience fewer crashes. Tesla says its Autopilot system, used mainly on freeways with human supervision, has logged airbag deployments about once per 5 million miles. The company has also asserted the system is “10x better.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Tech|Pony AI|Tesla|WeRide,EN,0,0,ASIA|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-20 22:53:28

After the announcement was made on Friday, major companies including Microsoft, Amazon, and JPMorgan sent urgent internal memos to staff, instructing H-1B visa holders already in the United States not to travel abroad, and urging those outside the country to return before the new fee system takes effect. The tech industry is bracing for market disruption The Trump administration announced its immigration policy , a $100,000 annual fee, on H-1B visas, the temporary employment permit used by thousands of foreign workers in the U.S. technology sector. The policy is set to take effect by midnight Saturday and is part of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on both legal and illegal immigration since he took office in January. “H-1B visa holders who are currently in the U.S. should remain in the U.S. and avoid international travel until the government issues clear travel guidance,” the law firm Ogletree Deakins wrote in an advisory to staff. The firm handles the bank’s visa applications. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended the measure , saying that it was a way to prioritize American graduates. “If you’re going to train somebody, you’re going to train one of the recent graduates from one of the great universities across our land. Train Americans. Stop bringing in people to take our jobs.” The new fee, which is reportedly $100,000 a year for each of the three years of a visa’s initial duration, is a significant increase from the current application costs of only a few thousand dollars. Analysts warned that the change could increase labor costs by millions for large firms, while startups and smaller tech firms could find the added burden unsustainable. India is bracing for impact The new rules have also rattled India’s $283 billion IT outsourcing industry. The Asian nation accounted for 71% of H-1B approvals in 2024, far ahead of China’s 11.7%, according to government data. “The additional cost will require adjustments, and the one-day deadline for implementation is destabilizing,” Nasscom said in a statement. The group added that the measure could have “ripple effects” on U.S. innovation and the global job market, particularly in technology services and artificial intelligence. Some analysts noted that the rule could force companies to relocate their high-value projects overseas, which would unintentionally accelerate the transfer of talent and capital to rival innovation hubs in Asia and Europe. “In the short term, Washington may collect a windfall; in the long term, the U.S. risks taxing away its innovation edge, trading dynamism for short-sighted protectionism,” Jeremy Goldman, an analyst at eMarketer, said . Critics of the H-1B program argue that it has been used to depress wages for American workers, but supporters insist that the visa brings in talent that the domestic labor market cannot supply fast enough. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, himself a former H-1B holder, reiterated on X that the program is “essential” to filling the skills gap. The H-1B program currently offers 65,000 visas annually, with an additional 20,000 visas available for individuals with advanced U.S. degrees. At the same time, Trump has signed an executive order to create a new immigration track dubbed the “ gold card .” For a one-time payment of $1M, foreign nationals will be eligible for U.S. permanent residency. Supporters of the measure believe it will attract wealthy investors, while critics believe it increases inequalities by privileging the wealthy over skilled professionals.

From Sept. 11 to 17, Kalshi accounted for 62% of total volume in the on-chain prediction market sector, according to data from Dune Analytics , while Polymarket’s stood at 37%. The former’s weekly trading pace topped $500 million, with an average open interest of around $189 million. Its volume is beyond that of Polymarket, which stood at $430 million, and its average open interest of $164 million, which implies “sticker positions on Polymarket and faster turnover on Kalshi.” Polymarket's longer-term markets, which often stretch over weeks or months, keep user funds locked in for longer periods, essentially. This shows up in the open interest-to-volume ratio: Polymarket averaged 0.38, while Kalshi sat lower at 0.29. That suggests Kalshi's users are trading more often, while Polymarket's positions tend to sit. Still, Polymarket is building out a greater position in the U.S. The platform has cleared its acquisition of QCX , a regulated derivatives exchange, to enter the country again. It has also launched earnings-based markets with social investing platform Stocktwits, designed to let stockholders hedge earnings risk and analysts gauge market sentiment in real time.

The increasing wave of allocations is a sign that diversification is becoming the new corporate standard for crypto adoption. For many years, Bitcoin was the only name in the discussion about digital reserves. However, a new wave of filings suggests that institutional players are building a more diversified portfolio of assets. In other words, firms are backing the new digital financing assets, treating their crypto reserves more like an investment fund. XRP remains back in the spotlight again after getting shelved for regulatory issues. The much-discussed altcoin MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly risen to $13.5 million, resulting in XRP whales flocking to it while XRP itself is set to break a new ATH. Corporate Treasuries Embrace XRP Amber International Holdings has revealed a $100 million digital asset reserve, which is the most striking example so far. Amber employed strategies that were not only focused on Bitcoin but also included the use of XRP, Solana, Ethereum, BNB, and SUI. The firm has revealed its XRP exposure in past financial audits, a strong signal that XRP is being recognized as a proper reserve asset. It is a major deviation from MicroStrategy, which is only doubling down on Bitcoin. According to Bill Morgan, a lawyer, the new corporate norm is that a willingness to diversify – not your ideological loyalty to one chain – is what counts. For corporate boards, we consider risk management, liquidity and long-term growth potential. Multi-Million Allocations Boost Confidence Amber’s move is not an isolated case. Trident and Digital Tech Holdings have pledged $500 million for XRP; Webus International has set aside $300 million; VivoPower International will offer $121 million; and Wellgistics Health has lined up $50 million in credit for further purchases. All of these commitments suggest a growing consensus that XRP should be part of modern treasuries, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The continuous accumulation of whale has enhanced the XRP price rise to surpass $3 mark. XRP is now closer to its bull run after a prolonged period of low volatility, according to experts following its surge. The New Altcoin That Gains Whale Attention While XRP’s rise is headline-worthy, retail traders and some whales are also turning to new opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project’s rapid growth — reaching $13.5 million in record time — has attracted the attention of seasoned investors, including XRP holders diversifying into the next potential breakout. Analysts note that MAGACOIN FINANCE offers many of the traits that institutions are now seeking in reserve assets: strong security audits, scalability, and a fast-growing community. Comparisons to Shiba Inu’s early days have only fueled more speculation, as investors look for tokens with grassroots momentum capable of evolving into mainstream players. Favorable Timing for XRP XRP above $3 has received some good support. With clarity achieved in the law, the regulatory uncertainty moat that kept institutions on the fence for years has been removed. At the same time, ETF applications associated with XRP remain pending, creating anticipation that approval would enhance its legitimacy. Thus, corporate adoption is likely to be made. Firms can minimise risk and improve cash management by including XRP into treasuries. The move puts them behind a well-established, liquid, and widely accepted token. The industry is starting to rethink bitcoin-only reserves due to concern over its volatile price and diversifying into a basket of coins. A Shift in Corporate Strategy The embrace of XRP signals a maturing crypto market. Treasuries are no longer mere ideological statements; they are risk-managed portfolios. When you invest in various assets, it reduces the amount of money you have tied up in any one asset. Subsequently, your experience is less affected by any one asset’s price volatility. As a result, you have broader access to the growth of the digital asset sector. This trend mirrors the way traditional finance works. Just as companies have cash reserves that may not just hold cash, treasury reserves are taking form in crypto too. Due to XRP’s liquidity, established history, and recently reclaimed trust by institutions, it should easily cut. The Road Ahead for XRP The market will watch how far XRP’s near-term momentum can carry prices above all-time highs. The growing whale accumulation and corporate treasury demand are paving a bullish path. If these ETF approvals are granted and institutional allocations continue, XRP could be one of the defining winners of this cycle. Currently, the rise of MAGACOIN FINANCE shows that institutional adoption isn’t the only growth driver in crypto. Solid grassroots projects with explosive community growth still capture the attention of whales and can provide surprising upside. Conclusion XRP moved past the $3 mark thanks to the recent corporate adoption from major names like Mastercard and Visa. Companies are abandoning the bitcoin-only strategy and are now looking at digital assets in a much broader portfolio. Institutional demand is coming up strong as Amber International, Trident Digital, and Webus International allocate hefty amounts to FTX. As corporate treasuries diversify, XRP stands to gain new legitimacy and liquidity. However, it is also retail investors who are impacting the story as MAGACOIN FINANCE emerges as a new whale opportunity. All these aspects show how the space is changing – institutional money is setting down new roots, while dynamic new tokens are stretching the limits.

Worldcoin has surged by more than 80% in just seven days, reaching around $1.60 and lifting its market cap above $3.2 billion. Trading volumes have also exploded, drawing a wave of speculative activity. The question now dominating market chatter is whether WLD can break the $2 resistance zone or if sellers will step in to take profits, bringing the rally to a pause. In the meantime another altcoin is gaining major attention due to its explosive growth – MAGACOIN FINANCE’s. Momentum Behind the Rally The rally hasn’t come out of nowhere. Renewed interest from both retail and institutional investors has fueled demand, while on-chain data shows large holders reducing their positions. In fact, whale-controlled supply has dropped to its lowest point since July, suggesting that profit-taking among big players may have cleared the way for retail investors to drive the token upward. Institutional accumulation has also been reported across several exchanges, hinting that more traditional capital is flowing into the project. Combined with growing liquidity, this has strengthened short-term momentum and helped WLD resist sharp sell-offs. Beyond price action, Worldcoin’s ambitious long-term vision continues to attract attention. The project aims to build a global proof-of-personhood network through its biometric “World ID” system. While this has raised regulatory concerns, particularly around data privacy, the concept has kept Worldcoin in the spotlight as a potentially disruptive force in digital identity. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Recognition While Worldcoin rides its breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly cementing itself as one of the fastest-growing altcoins in 2025. Security audits, a clear roadmap, and an expanding community base have positioned the project as a promising contender in the crowded crypto landscape. Analysts suggest that the combination of transparency, scalability, and grassroots support is what makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out. Unlike the heavily institutionalized flows that are driving Solana and Worldcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rise is powered by retail adoption and strong community growth. Many market watchers view this as a healthy sign, particularly for a token still in its early stages. While it may not have hit mainstream headlines yet, its momentum points toward the potential for rapid recognition as market conditions evolve. Technical Analysis: Critical Levels Looking closer at Worldcoin’s charts, indicators suggest the token has entered a consolidation zone following its explosive rally. The relative strength index (RSI) is around 42 on the hourly timeframe, which leaves room for further upside without flashing overbought conditions. This makes a continuation possible if demand strengthens again. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) has also shown signs of turning positive, while short-term moving averages have crossed above longer-term ones. These technical signals support a bullish bias in the short run. The nearest resistance lies around $1.84. Worldcoin tested this level once but failed to close above it, which makes it the key barrier to watch. A successful breakout there could trigger the next leg higher, with $2.00 emerging as the next psychological milestone. Should momentum remain strong, upside targets between $2.50 and $3.50 are plausible in the months ahead. On the flip side, downside risks remain clear. The $1.20 to $1.25 range has acted as strong support, but if bears manage to push the price below that zone, a retest of $1.00 or even $0.80 could follow. Such a move would erase much of the recent gains and potentially dampen enthusiasm among traders. Bullish Case: Short- and Long-Term Targets Short term, analysts believe the $1.80 to $2.00 zone is well within reach. If Worldcoin manages to break through $2 with sustained trading volume, it could open the path toward $2.50–$3.50. Longer term, if adoption of the World ID project accelerates and regulators provide clarity instead of roadblocks, some market experts think WLD could revisit the $5 level within a year. The bullish case ultimately rests on whether investors see the proof-of-personhood model as a viable, scalable solution in the digital age. If that narrative strengthens, demand for WLD could expand far beyond speculation. Bearish Case: Regulatory Risks and Whale Activity Despite optimism, there are clear risks. Regulatory pushback on biometric data collection has already raised concerns in several regions. If more jurisdictions restrict or ban the technology, it could undermine adoption and weaken investor confidence. Another major risk lies in whale activity. While recent selling has eased, large holders remain a powerful influence. Renewed profit-taking could overwhelm retail demand, sending prices lower in a matter of hours. Conclusion Worldcoin’s rapid climb has captured market attention, with the $2 barrier now looming as the next big test. The technical outlook suggests further upside is possible, but traders should be wary of volatility as both regulatory headlines and whale activity continue to shape the market. For now, the short-term bias leans bullish, with targets above $2 in play. Longer term, much depends on whether World ID adoption scales despite scrutiny. At the same time, new projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are building from the ground up, offering fresh opportunities for those looking beyond the biggest names. Together, they represent the dual forces of the crypto market: explosive rallies driven by speculation and the steady rise of community-driven projects.

Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-on-coinbase-plunges-95-heres-the-implication/,"Abs Nassif, host of the Good Morning Crypto podcast, reported on September 19 that Coinbase now holds only two wallets containing a combined 32.8 million XRP. He stated that this represents a 95% drop since June 5, when Coinbase held 970 million units. This steep reduction shows how quickly institutional and retail buyers have been acquiring XRP. The sharp decline in exchange wallets from 970 million to 32.8 million units indicates a substantial outflow of tokens, signaling a significant shift in available liquidity that traders and analysts closely monitor. BREAKING: COINBASE IS DOWN TO 2 WALLETS W/ 32.8 MILLION $XRP ! THIS IS 95% DOWN SINCE JUNE 5, WHEN COINBASE HAD 970 MILLION UNITS! https://t.co/yE4W7vMutn — Good Morning Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) September 19, 2025 Shrinking Supply Creates Pressure A rapid reduction in available supply on a major exchange changes the market dynamic. When large amounts of XRP leave centralized platforms, it becomes more difficult for new buyers to obtain large quantities at stable prices. This effect can create upward price pressure if demand remains steady or increases. The size and speed of Coinbase’s XRP decline suggest strong ongoing demand across multiple investor categories. Although some of these assets could be moving into custody solutions, wallets controlled by whales and long-term investors, the immediate effect on the exchange’s order books is reduced supply. Such a situation often gives confidence to traders expecting higher prices, especially when major exchanges show sustained outflows over time. Supply Shocks in Digital Assets Supply shocks occur when a sudden or sustained change in available quantity disrupts normal market conditions. In the case of XRP, a 95% reduction of exchange reserves over a few months fits this pattern. If buyers continue to acquire XRP while exchanges hold limited amounts, the resulting scarcity can push prices higher. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market participants view this as a sign of accumulation, where holders plan to retain assets rather than trade them quickly. Historically, in cryptocurrency markets, significant outflows from exchanges have correlated with price increases, as coins become less available to meet demand. XRP’s current situation aligns with that trend, and some believe a supply shock is inevitable , making it a focal point for investors tracking exchange flows. Potential Benefits for XRP Holders If the current rate of XRP accumulation continues, the reduced exchange reserves could set the stage for stronger pricing. As liquidity tightens, it may force buyers to pay more to acquire the same amount of XRP. For holders, this can translate into notable gains if market conditions support continued demand.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-its-time-for-massive-xrp-breakout-heres-why/,"XRP’s price action has entered a decisive phase after months of consolidation. In a recent post on X, prominent crypto analyst Carl Moon shared a chart predicting a massive breakout for XRP. His post coincided with a surge of interest around XRP’s market structure as the token moved through major liquidity zones. The comment showed his view that XRP’s latest moves have cleared obstacles that previously restrained its price. XRP’s Liquidity Sweep and Market Structure The chart Moon posted shows XRP completing what he described as a sweep of both “buy side liquidity” and “sell side liquidity.” This liquidity sweep indicates that the token has run price levels where both buyers and sellers placed large orders, a process often associated with clearing the market of weaker positions. $XRP Swept both sides! Its time for a massive breakout!

Another key feature of the chart is a symmetrical triangle pattern drawn from June to September, with a breakout point marked just above $3. He highlighted a breakout trade investors can make near current levels, marking this area as a launch point for a possible upward move. If his analysis holds, it could send XRP above $6, marking a new all-time high for the digital asset. Why This Matters for Price Movement Moon’s chart also highlights a “Smart Money First TP” (take profit) around $3.70 and a “Final TP” near $6.19. These levels suggest the analyst expects XRP to continue appreciating if the breakout holds. By sweeping liquidity on both sides, XRP may have removed near-term resistance , potentially allowing a cleaner path for the price to trend upward. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Volume profile data on the left side of the chart further supports this view. The histogram shows heavier trading activity around $2.00 to $2.50 and much thinner volume above $3.50, hinting that once the price surpasses these zones, it could move more freely toward higher targets. The posted chart implies that XRP’s consolidation phase has matured and that buyers have stepped in following the liquidity sweep. XRP’s Next Steps Moon’s analysis also highlights how XRP’s recent technical behavior aligns with a bullish narrative. His callout of both liquidity sweeps, the breakout zone, and projected take-profit levels offers a structured roadmap for observers tracking XRP’s movements. If XRP maintains support above the breakout zone and volume continues to build, the technical setup outlined in Moon’s chart could mark the beginning of an extended move potentially culminating above $6.

52033010,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=824858,1758412829,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52033010.jpeg,"As XRP Grabs Headlines, Can Cardano Price Surge Toward $100?",https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/as-xrp-grabs-headlines-can-cardano-price-surge-toward-100/,"While tokens like XRP dominate headlines amid rising ETF approval speculations, the Cardano price is also gaining attention as market conditions slowly recover from bearish trends. New data from Changelly, a crypto exchange, has suggested that Cardano could be gearing up for a massive breakout. The big question now is whether the cryptocurrency has the momentum to reach a $100 milestone. Why A $100 Cardano Price Remains A Distant Goal Cardano’s price action has generated significant interest in recent months, as analysts from Changelly attempt to project its next big move. According to their forecasts, ADA remains a relatively low-priced cryptocurrency compared to some of its altcoin rivals like XRP, with projections pointing to modest gains in the near term and a potential surge above $100 by 2040. Related Reading: Bitmine’s Ethereum Appetite Grows With Fresh $70 Million Buy Changelly’s outlook for 2025 suggests a trading range between $0.77 and $0.97, with the average price stabilizing around $1.17. These numbers highlight a steady upward trend but remain far from the speculative $100 level. Breaking this down further, experts from the crypto platform project that in September 2025, ADA could fluctuate between $0.891 and $0.924, averaging near $0.908. By October 2025, expectations widen slightly, with potential movement between $0.88 and $1.17. November’s outlook places the Cardano price between $0.77 and $1.05, averaging around $0.91, while December 2025 suggests values between $0.807 and $0.87. Taken together, these estimates show that ADA is likely to continue strengthening its price floor while maintaining realistic, incremental growth rather than explosive parabolic moves. From this perspective, a $100 Cardano price seems improbable within the near or mid-term future. However, in the long-term, Changelly predicts that ADA could exceed the $100 target to reach $116.83 by February 2040. The maximum price for that month has also been set at $132.72. Cardano’s Price Action While Changelly’s technical analysis provides insight into potential short-term price movements, Cardano’s long-term story is deeply rooted in its fundamentals. At present, the cryptocurrency trades around $0.91 with a circulating supply of over 35.7 billion ADA, giving it a market capitalization of approximately $32 billion. ADA has displayed steady momentum in the last week, climbing 1.48% and nearly 6% over the past month. According to Changelly, this growth signals that Cardano still commands a solid market presence, reinforcing its potential for a breakout soon. Although the cryptocurrency has dipped by over $0.01 in the past 24 hours, Changelly points out that recent trading activity has turned notably bullish for the cryptocurrency.

Still, Changelly notes that ADA is showing great potential lately, suggesting that its current price level could be a good buying opportunity for investors.

A growing number of public companies hold massive amounts of Bitcoin on their balance sheets. For investors buying these stocks, it can sometimes offer even greater upside than holding BTC itself. Why Some Bitcoin Stocks Outpace BTC Itself In a thought-provoking post on X, Adam Livingston, author of the Bitcoin Age and the Great Harvest, offers a compelling argument for why investors should consider buying the stock of Bitcoin treasury companies, rather than just BTC itself. His perspective goes beyond a simple leveraged play and speaks to a long-term vision of a new financial infrastructure built on a BTC foundation. Livingston’s thesis is that a new paradigm-shifting financial infrastructure built over the coming years will take Bitcoin to $100-200 trillion BTC market, supporting an equal magnitude of Bitcoin-denominated credit and equity. This new infrastructure would enable global transactions at light speed on open ledgers, providing everyone with a censorship-resistant, inflation-proof yield stream. The key takeaway from the recent unconference is that this infrastructure needs to be built because it is where solving complex issues, such as custody, compliance, and distribution across different jurisdictions, comes into play. It also involves creating products that cater to traditional investors who may not want or need a volatile, infinite-duration asset like Bitcoin itself. Thus, these products can strip away volatility, manage duration, or FX risk , allowing institutions and individuals to gain the spread and recycle profits back into BTC collateral. However, Livingston argues that Bitcoin can enable the exact instruments they do want. If BTC is to reach $1,000,000, it will require a robust financial infrastructure to funnel global capital into the asset . Why Waiting For A Bear Market Is A Flawed Strategy Crypto analyst Rajatsonfinance has highlighted a contrarian perspective on Bitcoin investing, urging people to abandon the common strategy of waiting for a bear market to start buying. Instead, he advocates for a more proactive approach centered on value creation and consistent accumulation. According to Rajatsonfinance, trying to time the market is a flawed and often unsuccessful endeavor. He argues that waiting for a crash could be used to build skills and create value in the real world. His primary advice is to focus on earning more money and then exchanging that income for Bitcoin, whether by selling services for dollars and converting them or by accepting BTC directly as payment. The analyst emphasized that if executed with a solid idea, passion, and consistent effort, it can lead to a far more significant BTC stack than one could ever accumulate by trying to buy the dip. He suggests that a successful business or a well-executed side hustle has the potential to generate far more than a modest $10,000 to $15,000, which would result in a holding far exceeding 0.1 BTC.",Bitcoin News|Adam Livingston|bitcoin|Bitcoin Age and the Great Harvest|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Rajatsonifinance,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-21 00:00:34

That move surprised the bond market. The 10-year Treasury yield, which had dipped below 4%, jumped to 4.145%. The 30-year yield, the one that matters for mortgages, rose to 4.76%, after hitting a weekly low of 4.604%. The Fed lowered its policy rate by 0.25% to 4.00%-4.25% on Wednesday, its first rate cut of the year. That helped push stocks higher, but the bond market didn’t react the same way. According to Bloomberg, investors in longer-term bonds didn’t get what they wanted — certainty that inflation would stay under control. Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at One Point BFG Wealth Partners, said traders used the Fed’s move to take profits, calling it a chance to “sell the news.” Peter said people holding long bonds “don’t want the Fed to be cutting interest rates.” When traders dump those bonds, prices go down and yields rise. That’s exactly what happened. Powell’s ‘risk management’ cut faces doubts from bond traders Peter pointed out that easing monetary policy while inflation is above 3% — and while the economy’s still solid — sends a risky signal. He said the Fed might be “taking the eye off” inflation. New Fed projections released on Wednesday show officials now expect inflation to rise slightly next year. That’s not what bondholders wanted to hear. Investors had hoped the Fed would move its focus away from inflation and toward jobs, especially after weak employment numbers earlier this month. Jerome Powell described the cut as a “risk management” move, mentioning the slowing labor market. But Peter said , “The bond market, if [longer yields] continue higher, would be sending a message that, ‘We don’t think you should be aggressively cutting interest rates with inflation stuck at 3%.’” He also explained that this week’s jump in yields came after bond prices had already been rising for months. Yields had fallen, but now they’re moving back up — just like they did after the Fed’s cut in September 2024. Peter said it’s worth noting that the 10-year yield hasn’t moved much since the start of the year, even though the Fed has cut rates more than once since then. Higher yields aren’t just bad news for bondholders. They affect everything from home loans to car financing. Mortgage rates rose after the Fed’s cut, wiping out the gains from their three-year low earlier in the week. That hit housing. On Thursday, homebuilder Lennar reported disappointing revenue for the third quarter and warned that deliveries would be weak in the next one. Co-CEO Stuart Miller blamed “continued pressures” in the housing market and “elevated” interest rates through Q3. Bond market waits for terrible news before buying again Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, said the bond market doesn’t move on one rate cut. He said, “It’s not the journey, it’s the destination.” What matters is how far the Fed plans to go. Chris said traders are trying to figure out “what’s the end game in this?” and that they’ll only respond once they’re convinced the Fed is serious about cutting rates significantly. Peter added that U.S. yields also follow what’s happening abroad. He said international rates have been rising, too, so foreign central bank actions matter here. But Chris had a warning for anyone rooting for lower yields. He said falling yields usually mean a recession’s coming. This week’s yield jump came right after jobless claims fell, which shows less risk of a downturn anytime soon. Chris said, “Don’t rejoice so much about getting bond yields down, because it may mean that it’s impossible for you to find work.” He also added, “Unfortunately, the bond market only really embraces bad news.

The notice appeared late Friday on the Bureau’s website and said only, “We will update users when more information is available.” Erika, who was nominated by President Joe Biden in 2023 and confirmed by the Senate the next year, was removed just hours after her team reported disappointing July job numbers and downward revisions for the two previous months. She found out about her firing through a two-line email from the White House Office of Presidential Personnel. “To be honest, I didn’t actually believe I had been fired,” Erika said Tuesday during an event at Bard College. She only checked her inbox after a reporter called her for comment about Trump’s post on X demanding she be fired. Trump calls numbers rigged, White House removes Erika after jobs release The jobs report that triggered the blowup was sent out on August 1. Erika briefed the Labor Department at 8 a.m. that morning and told them late-reporting firms had dragged the data down. “I explained to the Secretary that the negative skew in job growth among the late reporting firms was an unusual event, but not an unprecedented one,” she said. She added that other labor market data looked stable, and this wasn’t necessarily a sign of recession. Still, she said the room was silent. “The faces around the table were glum,” Erika said. “I asked if anyone had any questions on the revisions before we moved on to the July numbers. There were none, so we moved on.” By 2 p.m. that day, Trump had posted online saying the numbers were manipulated. Later that afternoon, he announced that Erika was no longer commissioner. On TV, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer described the revisions as “unexpected,” and said they were mostly tied to education and seasonal roles. Later, on X, she backed the firing. “I agree wholeheartedly with @POTUS that our jobs numbers must be fair, accurate, and never manipulated for political purposes,” she wrote. Since Erika’s removal, the BLS has made additional revisions. A benchmark update released on September 9 was met with more White House criticism, calling it “another blunder in the lengthy history of inaccuracies and incompetence at BLS.” Economists defended the revisions, saying they’re standard because businesses often submit data late. The BLS usually updates the numbers as more information comes in to make them more precise. Trump has picked EJ Antoni, the Heritage Foundation’s chief economist, to take over the job. EJ is known for his MAGA views and has drawn criticism from economists across party lines for his lack of experience. His Senate confirmation is still pending, and one Republican senator has already voiced “extreme reservations” about supporting him. Budget issues and staffing cuts worsen BLS operations The BLS has struggled for years with staff shortages and tight budgets. These problems didn’t start with Trump but have gotten worse during his second term. The agency now relies on a statistical method to fill in the gaps in inflation tracking. Only recently has it been allowed to hire more workers to collect price data again. The Labor Department’s Office of Inspector General opened a review last week into the BLS’ “challenges” around data collection and employment revisions. Erika had over 20 years of federal experience before her firing, including time at the Census Bureau, Treasury, and Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers. She called Trump’s move a “dangerous step” with “serious economic consequences.” She ended her speech by saying, “That’s an attack on the independence of an institution arguably as important as the Federal Reserve for economic stability.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",News|BLS,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|FIAT|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-21 00:30:00
52033882,https://timestabloid.com/?p=83884,1758414608,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top 3 Altcoins That Will Likely Outperform Bitcoin in Q4,https://timestabloid.com/top-3-altcoins-that-will-likely-outperform-bitcoin-in-q4/,"Altcoins are braving turbulent conditions as Q3 winds down, leaving investors to question what the final quarter of the year might bring. Historically, September has been one of the weakest months for Bitcoin, often dragging other tokens lower in the process. But this year could play out differently. Analysts see favorable conditions that may allow select altcoins to take the lead, giving investors a chance to secure bigger gains before the cycle matures. In this shifting landscape, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly entered the spotlight , with some experts calling it one of the top picks for the season. A Break From Tradition September is known for muted performance, with Bitcoin traditionally averaging losses during this month across multiple years. Those declines have usually spread to the broader market, creating a cautious atmosphere among traders. However, analyst Michael Van De Poppe argues that the current cycle is not following the same pattern. He notes that while corrections have hit the market in recent weeks, momentum could flip in Q4 as altcoins resist Bitcoin’s seasonal weakness. “This cycle has played out differently from previous ones,” he explained, pointing out that conditions are aligning for altcoins to gain strength. If his outlook proves correct, Q4 could mark one of the most active altcoin seasons in recent memory. Federal Reserve Holds the Key One of the biggest catalysts on the horizon is the upcoming meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve. The central bank is widely expected to lower interest rates for the first time this year, trimming them by 25 basis points. With futures markets showing strong odds of such a move, optimism is building that liquidity conditions will improve. Lower rates tend to benefit high-growth and risk-on assets, particularly cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is often the first to react when conditions shift, setting the tone for the broader market. Van De Poppe compared the current setup to late 2019 and early 2020, when a supportive policy environment set the stage for a multi-month crypto rally. Token Unlocks and Market Impact At the same time, September brings a wave of token unlocks worth nearly $10 billion across various projects. These events typically add pressure by increasing supply, sparking fears of sell-offs. Yet this cycle could be different. Analysts highlight that much of the supply is often absorbed through private deals, softening the blow. Van De Poppe believes the bigger takeaway is that tokens without unlocks could shine brighter than those facing heavy selling pressure. For investors, this makes selectivity more important than ever. Choosing projects that combine strong fundamentals with clean tokenomics could be the key to outperforming Bitcoin in Q4. A Rare Opportunity Takes Center Stage While established altcoins are preparing for Q4, newer projects are also drawing serious attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE has already raised $14 million in its presale , a figure that highlights the enthusiasm around its launch. Some market experts suggest it could deliver as much as 45x returns for early participants if momentum holds. Unlike many presales that rely solely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building around utility and community growth. Its fast-moving presale phase and growing recognition across social platforms have positioned it as one of the most exciting projects heading into Q4. In an environment where investors are searching for the next big opportunity beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a clear contender. Altcoins to Watch According to Van De Poppe, the sectors with the strongest potential include decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), and tokens within the Ethereum ecosystem. These areas are already showing signs of renewed activity and could act as leaders if sentiment improves. Chainlink is one such example. The token has been building momentum and is currently trading in the $20 to $25 range , with investors closely watching to see if it can maintain upward pressure. Chainlink’s importance in powering decentralized data feeds continues to make it a top contender whenever altcoins trend higher. Other projects within DeFi and Ethereum-linked networks are also starting to show positive signs. With liquidity expected to improve after the Fed’s decision, analysts see these segments attracting both retail and institutional interest in the months ahead. Outlook for Q4 The stage is set for an eventful end to the year. If the Federal Reserve confirms rate cuts, conditions could align perfectly for altcoins to outperform Bitcoin, echoing past market cycles when smaller tokens surged as liquidity expanded. Chainlink and other Ethereum ecosystem projects are already showing sparks, while presale leaders like MAGACOIN FINANCE are generating excitement as high-upside plays. While risks remain, particularly with large token unlocks and lingering macroeconomic uncertainties, analysts believe the ingredients for a strong Q4 rally are in place. For investors, this could be one of the last major windows to position before the next phase of the bull market takes hold. Conclusion Altcoins are entering Q4 with a rare setup: Bitcoin’s seasonal weakness, a likely rate cut, and improving sentiment across key sectors. Chainlink and other ecosystem tokens are gaining traction, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about presales of 2025. If momentum builds, these projects could stand out as the top performers in the final quarter of the year.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $3.39 to $4.14. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.396 Market Cap $638.07M Trading Volume $6.13M Circulating Supply 1.609B FLOW All-time High $46.16 All-time Low $0.2916 24-hour High $0.4024 24-hour Low $0.3956 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 3.08% 50-Day SMA $0.3925 14-Day RSI 47.46 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 48 (Neutral) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $0.3985 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown FLOW is consolidating at $0.396, with $0.387 as critical support. RSI shows signs of seller fatigue. A possible buy zone is present at $0.387–$0.393. Flow coin 1-day price analysis On the daily timeframe for September 21, FLOW is consolidating just below the midline of the Bollinger Bands at $0.407, with the price pinned near $0.396. The recent red candles show that sellers have retained control after repeated failures to break past $0.427. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains bearish with the histogram still in negative territory, signaling fading bullish momentum. Volume has also declined, suggesting that traders are sitting on the sidelines, waiting for a decisive move. A buy-in could be considered near $0.387–$0.390 if support holds, with profit-taking targets around $0.407 and $0.425 if bullish momentum returns. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, FLOW is trading between $0.393 and $0.403 with no strong directional momentum. The Alligator indicator lines are compressed, reflecting consolidation, and resistance remains firm at $0.402–$0.404. The RSI is at 39, edging closer to oversold territory, signalling seller exhaustion. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView If FLOW slips below $0.387, further downside could follow. On the upside, reclaiming $0.404 would be key to regaining bullish traction, opening the door for a move toward $0.415 and potentially $0.425. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.4150 SELL SMA 5 $0.4062 SELL SMA 10 $0.4102 SELL SMA 21 $0.4070 SELL SMA 50 $0.3925 BUY SMA 100 $0.3787 BUY SMA 200 $0.3985 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.4095 SELL EMA 5 $0.4082 SELL EMA 10 $0.4034 SELL EMA 21 $0.3965 BUY EMA 50 $0.3885 BUY EMA 100 $0.3899 BUY EMA 200 $0.4278 SELL What to expect from Flow? If FLOW holds above $0.387, we might see a bounce toward $0.404–$0.425, but a breakdown below this support risks a slide toward $0.380 an lower. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance. Recent news/opinion on Flow Flow is seeing a big rise in activity after LayerZero integration, with transactions up over 600%. It continues to support major consumer apps like NBA Top Shot while improving its developer tools through Flow EVM and protocol upgrades. Flow Blockchain just posted one of its strongest quarters yet, blending consumer-scale adoption with surging DeFi momentum.

In comparison to PEPE, where the price movement is driven by memes and social buzz mostly, MUTM is being favored by investors for its sound DeFi fundamentals. The $0.035 token is built on a dual lending-and-borrowing protocol and is being regarded as a project that has actual staying power. Mutuum price in the current presale phase 6 is $0.035 per token. The presale has already attained more than $16.01 million and more than 16410 supporters. To investors who are exhausted by memecoin volatility, the change to MUTM is an indication of a larger trend, where 2025 could be the year when utility-based coins overtake hype-driven bets. PEPE Coin Near Support Levels as Meme Coin Sentiment Fades PEPE Coin (PEPE) is trading at the moment at $0.00001126 and its 24-hour range is at approximately $0.00001066 to $0.00001114. The token remains strong in its support zone, but it cannot go up without new catalysts. A lot of its price action is both community buzz and short emotion-based as it lacks underlying utility or protocol developments. DeFi token Mutuum Finance on the other hand is actively gaining the attention of investors who believe it has more lasting potential than PEPE. Mutuum Finance Presale Overheats MUTM presale round 6 presale indicates that the project is expanding rapidly. It has soared past 16.01 million and attracted more than 16410 holders. Those who purchase in this round will be able to make huge profits once the token can be traded. Mutuum Finance is establishing a healthy ecosystem, and stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Mutuum Finance has collaborated with CertiK to launch a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program to drive the security of the platform. The program also invites security developers, white-hat hackers as well as researchers to submit bugs. The bugs are classified according to risk and effort; risk, critical, major, minor, and low. The protocol is made strong by the program as user balances are maintained and the trust of the investors is energized. The protocol is risk-averse in terms of market exposure and illiquidity management, hence close levels, liquidation levels, and liquidator incentives do exist. The volatility of assets directly affects the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio and the liquidation guidelines: the higher the volatility of a particular asset, the more risky the parameters, the more lending regulations can be imposed. In addition to this, the reserve multipliers are risk-weighted on assets and make the protocol stable, safe and robust in any market nature. Changing Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance is building a passive lending and borrowing protocol, which will be based on active capital management and will give users the ability to borrow against stacks of coins that have been securitized. It uses the platform on stability algorithm and interest rate optimisation algorithm based on the efficiency drivers and long-term capital utilisation resilience. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly gaining popularity among investors who are no longer looking for meme-based investment projects, such as PEPE, but rather utility-based DeFi coins. Stage 6 tokens are valued at $0.035, and the presale has already raised an excess of $16.01 million and has 16,410+ holders. Supported by a $50,000 CertiK bug bounty, a USD-pegged stablecoin, and high-risk management measures, MUTM is safe, scaled, and useful in reality. With PEPE gaining traction but being hype-based, 2025 can be the year when investors prefer fundamentals. Get your MUTM tokens before the next price hike of the presale.

The BullZilla Ripple Cronos 2025 crypto narrative is gaining momentum, supported by Ripple momentum and BullZilla’s early access buzz. Cronos presale interest is adding to the BullZilla 100x hype, while the BullZilla crypto whitelist and Ripple gains continue to draw investor attention. With BullZilla presale growth and Cronos adoption aligning, these new coins, BullZilla, Ripple, and Cronos, are becoming standout presale opportunities. Looking ahead, the BullZilla 2025 top new crypto picks are positioned to shape the next wave of 100x growth stories. BullZilla: The Meme Coin That Doesn’t Just Roar—It Burns BullZilla isn’t just another meme coin riding waves of internet culture. It’s a project engineered to reward conviction through an innovative Roar Burn Mechanism that ties community engagement directly to token scarcity. Unlike traditional deflationary tactics, BullZilla integrates burning as a live, community-witnessed event, creating both excitement and measurable economic impact. Stage 3C: Whale Signal Detected BullZilla’s presale has already shown remarkable traction: Current Stage : Stage 3 (Phase 3C) Current Price : $0.00007241 Raised : $530,000+ Token Holders : Over 1,700 For early adopters, this is not just an entry point, it’s a chance to accumulate before a pivotal supply shift takes place. The Roar Burn Mechanism Explained Bull Zilla introduces a cyclical process of supply destruction tied to project milestones, described in three parts: Token Burn Every time the project unlocks a new chapter, a portion of $BZIL is permanently removed from circulation. This happens live on-chain, visible to all. Transparency is built into the DNA of this system. Roar Surge The burn isn’t silent. It comes with a wave of announcements across social channels, designed to amplify community excitement and awareness. Each surge signals progress, sparks conversations, and increases market demand. Price Dynamics Scarcity is the oldest driver of value. As supply contracts, remaining tokens become more valuable. Combined with surging attention, this mechanism has the potential to trigger exponential price growth. In practice, it means that every chapter achieved by BullZilla doesn’t just mark progress, it deepens scarcity, embedding a cycle of continuous upward pressure. Applications Beyond Speculation BullZilla positions itself as a cultural meme coin with tangible economic structures. Its presale narrative has already drawn comparisons to the early phases of meme coins that became household names, but the addition of the Roar Burn Mechanism adds structural integrity to its journey. With its unique approach, it is also being highlighted among the Top new coins for 100x gains, making it a standout in the presale market. Analysts suggest that BullZilla could join the ranks of the Top new coins for 100x gains in 2025 due to its strong community backing and innovative tokenomics. By designing scarcity into growth, BullZilla provides both narrative momentum and tokenomic discipline, two rare features in a space often dominated by hype without backing. Investment Scenario: $9,000 in BullZilla Today Imagine an allocation of $9,000 into BullZilla at the presale price of $0.00007241. That purchase would secure more than 124 million $BZIL tokens. Should BullZilla reach just $0.01 in the next cycle, that initial $9,000 allocation could grow into $1.24 million. While no projection is guaranteed, this hypothetical illustrates how structural scarcity combined with explosive community growth can lead to once-in-a-lifetime ROI opportunities. How to Buy BullZilla Coins Getting into BullZilla’s presale is designed to be straightforward: Set Up a Wallet Download a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Buy Ethereum (ETH) Purchase ETH from an exchange like Coinbase or Binance and transfer it to your wallet. Visit the Presale Site Connect your wallet to the official BullZilla presale portal. Swap ETH for $BZIL Select the desired allocation, confirm, and secure your position in the presale. Tokens are claimable after the presale concludes. For those looking at top new coins for 100x gains, the clock is ticking and BullZilla’s Roar Burn Mechanism makes every stage pricier than the last. Ripple: Regulatory Winds, Payment Rails, and Global Liquidity Ripple has been at the center of crypto’s most public regulatory battle. With recent clarity in its case against the SEC, Ripple now stands as one of the top new coins for 100x gains Ripple’s XRP Ledger enables near-instant cross-border payments at a fraction of the cost of traditional systems. Banks and payment providers no longer need to tie up capital in nostro accounts; instead, they can use XRP as a bridge asset to settle in seconds. What makes Ripple particularly compelling for 2025 is its dual positioning: on one hand, it appeals to regulators and institutions; on the other, it provides an open-source network that developers can build on. Analysts note that Ripple’s network throughput and liquidity depth make it one of the few scalable payment rails suitable for enterprise adoption. For investors seeking stability plus upside, Ripple offers something different from meme coins. It’s not about hype, it’s about embedding blockchain into the core of financial infrastructure rising as one of the top new coins for 100x gains Cronos: Building a Web3 Universe Beyond Exchanges Cronos is more than an exchange-linked chain. Backed by one of the most recognized names in crypto trading, it extends far beyond exchange services to become a full Web3 ecosystem. Cronos provides a scalable and interoperable blockchain built on the Cosmos SDK, with EVM compatibility that attracts Ethereum developers. The latest developments in Cronos’ roadmap show deep integration with DeFi, NFTs, and GameFi. By lowering transaction fees and enabling easy cross-chain asset transfers, Cronos has become an attractive hub for developers looking for reach without high costs. In the landscape of top new coins for 100x gains, Cronos offers something BullZilla and Ripple don’t: a hybrid of utility and accessibility that ties together trading, entertainment, and DeFi growth. Conclusion: Top New Coins for 100x Gains BullZilla ($BZIL) , Ripple, and Cronos together demonstrate the spectrum of opportunity in crypto. BullZilla’s Roar Burn Mechanism drives scarcity and cultural hype. Ripple pushes institutional adoption of real-time payments. Cronos expands ecosystems into gaming, NFTs, and DeFi.

52035687,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=178396,1758418220,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/52035687.jpeg,XRP Blows Past Corporate Giants – Experts Eye $6 Next,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-blows-past-corporate-giants-experts-eye-6-next/,"XRP has reached a historic milestone by surpassing some of the world’s largest corporations in market value. The cryptocurrency now boasts a capitalization of around $184 billion , overtaking Citigroup’s $183.6 billion valuation. It has also moved ahead of companies like Shopify and Verizon, solidifying its status as one of the top global assets. With momentum building, analysts believe XRP could push toward the $6 mark in the near term. Meanwhile, some experts note that MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing even faster growth at an earlier stage , leading many to label it one of the most promising altcoins of the current bull market. XRP’s Historic Milestone The latest rally saw XRP trade above $3.10 for the first time in weeks, delivering double-digit weekly gains. This surge has placed it among the world’s top 100 most valuable assets , ranking just below leading multinationals and financial institutions. For many observers, this moment is about more than numbers — it signals that cryptocurrency is increasingly being treated on par with established Wall Street giants. Crossing Citigroup’s market cap in particular is a symbolic achievement. Citigroup is one of the oldest and most influential banks in the United States, and for XRP to surpass its valuation demonstrates how far digital assets have come in challenging traditional finance. The fact that XRP now competes directly with corporate heavyweights for investor attention highlights the shifting balance between legacy institutions and blockchain-based alternatives. ETF Speculation Builds Momentum Much of XRP’s recent growth has been fueled by optimism around a potential XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) . According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, the REX-Osprey ETF is expected to launch as soon as next week, after a brief delay. The launch of such a product in the United States would be a landmark moment for XRP, providing investors with an easy way to gain exposure through traditional financial markets. This speculation has generated significant excitement, as ETFs often act as catalysts for new inflows from both retail and institutional players. Many analysts believe the ETF narrative is one of the primary drivers behind XRP’s push above $3 and could provide the fuel needed for further gains. XRP Faces a New Rival As XRP continues to make headlines, another name is starting to gain serious traction: MAGACOIN FINANCE . The project has quickly grown in popularity during its presale, drawing thousands of participants in just weeks. What sets it apart is its ability to scale community engagement at an impressive pace, while positioning itself as a forward-looking ecosystem rather than a one-dimensional token. Whales who have traditionally concentrated their holdings in XRP are now starting to diversify into MAGACOIN FINANCE, betting on its potential to deliver exponential growth. Analysts suggest that, at its current trajectory, MAGACOIN FINANCE could outpace XRP’s early adoption curve , establishing itself as one of the top performers in this bull cycle. Its unique mix of accessibility, innovation, and rapid momentum is why many see it as a standout altcoin for 2025. Real-World Use Strengthens XRP Beyond speculation, XRP’s real-world application has helped fuel confidence in its valuation. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, which uses XRP as a bridge currency for cross-border payments, is being adopted by financial institutions worldwide. This distinguishes XRP from purely speculative digital assets, giving it practical utility that supports long-term investor interest. The fact that banks and payment providers are increasingly using XRP adds another layer of credibility. Investors are not just buying into a token with hype-driven potential but into an asset that is already solving billion-dollar problems in international payments. This real-world adoption is part of what makes XRP’s latest achievements sustainable rather than fleeting. A Symbolic Shift The broader significance of XRP overtaking corporations like Citigroup and Shopify is that digital assets are no longer fringe investments. They now compete directly with some of the most recognizable companies in the world. This shift underscores how investor capital is diversifying, with traditional finance and crypto increasingly intersecting. Analysts stress that for XRP to maintain its bullish trajectory, follow-up strength will be needed. Sustaining momentum after major rallies is often the key to reaching higher levels. With the ETF launch on the horizon and continued real-world use cases, XRP appears well-positioned to take the next step toward the $6 target that many experts are eyeing. Conclusion XRP’s rise to a $184 billion market cap and its climb past major corporations represent a landmark moment for the crypto industry. The coming ETF launch could provide the spark needed for further growth, while Ripple’s payment network continues to solidify XRP’s long-term value. At the same time, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are showing extraordinary growth potential , with some predicting it could rival the early trajectory of XRP itself. Together, these developments highlight a crypto market that is not only thriving but increasingly competing head-to-head with the giants of traditional finance.

Notably, the crypto market leader initially surged to $118,000 as bullish sentiments rose after the US Federal Reserve announced the first interest rate cut of 2025. However, Bitcoin has since retraced to around $115,700 in the past 24 hours, as transaction activity cooled off. In studying the asset’s price structure, a popular market analyst with the X username KillaXBT has highlighted two important price levels. Related Reading: Countdown To ‘Bitcoin Bottom Day’: Why September 21 Could Change Everything Bitcoin’s Weekly Open Faces Pressure Amid Daily Imbalance Threat In an X post on September 19, KillaXBT shares a vital cautionary insight on the present Bitcoin market, identifying two support zones in danger. Notably, as of the latest session, BTC has retested its weekly open at $115,219, a level that has served as a key pivot point for both bulls and bears. Holding above this threshold would be a strong sign of strength, while a decisive move lower could tilt market sentiment bearish. However, there is also a heavy focus on a daily fair value gap extending down to $113,355, highlighted on the charts as an area of imbalance left behind by rapid price action. KillaXBT explains that losing the weekly open would likely trigger a price decline to $113,355 because such inefficiencies eventually get filled, as price retraces into the zone to rebalance order flow. However, there is also the presence of the previous wick low at $114,367, which currently sits just above the FVG zone. This intermediate support may act as a buffer before any deeper probe toward the $113,355 mark. According to KillaXBT, Bitcoin price holding above the weekly open and FVG price zone is critical for price action going into the next week. A successful price defence at these levels could result in a reclaim of $118,000 claim and potentially the present ATH at $124,000. Meanwhile, a decisive price fall below $113,355 would expose the premier cryptocurrency to downside targets around $112,000, $110,000, and $108,000.

The disruption, confirmed on July 25, 2025, comes only two years after Tether unveiled the Bitcoin mining project in the South American nation, citing a rich supply of renewable energy sources. Tether’s Operational Fallout With Rising Energy Bill According to local media Busqueda , the payment defaults by Tether began in May 2025. By June, UTE’s president, Andrea Cabrera, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Microfin, the local operator tied to the mining project, in an effort to negotiate a settlement. However, after arrears continued to mount, UTE invoked standard procedures, using security deposits before suspending power supply at the mining sites in Flores and Florida on July 25. The power cut produces immediate operational consequences, compromising the facilities’ computing nodes and reducing hash rate output, while slowing down general expansion goals. Meanwhile, restarting the sites will also incur additional costs, from renegotiating contracts to restoring technical capacity. And even such processes often require weeks, depending on the guarantees offered and compliance with regulatory protocols.Tether entered Uruguay in 2023 with plans to leverage the country’s renewable energy profile through its “Tether Energy” initiative. Uruguay generates approximately 95% of its electricity from non-fossil sources, making it one of the most attractive jurisdictions globally for “low-carbon” industrial activity. The project was positioned as a step toward diversifying Tether’s business model beyond stablecoin issuance, with ambitions to eventually secure 1% of Bitcoin’s global hash rate.Back in 2023, the company’s CTO, Paolo Ardoino, said about the project: By harnessing the power of Bitcoin and Uruguay’s renewable energy capabilities, Tether is leading the way in sustainable and responsible Bitcoin mining; Our unwavering commitment to renewable energy ensures that every Bitcoin we mine leaves a minimal ecological footprint while upholding the security and integrity of the Bitcoin network. Tether is proud to spearhead a movement that combines cutting-edge technology, sustainable practices, and financial innovation Following the recent revelations by the Uruguayan media, neither Tether nor Microfin has yet to reveal their official position. USDT Reaches New Market Cap High At $171.5 Billion In other news, Tether’s stablecoin USDT has attained a new market cap value of $171.5 billion, strengthening its dominant market position.

After breaking out of its key $0.22–$0.24 channel, momentum is building as bullish signals align, hinting that the meme coin may be gearing up for another powerful move. Breakout From $0.22–$0.24 Marks End Of Consolidation Alpha Crypto Signal, in a recent update, revealed a significant development for Dogecoin, noting that the meme coin has successfully broken out of its long-standing horizontal channel. This channel, which had contained its price between $0.22 and $0.24 for an extended period, had been a key consolidation zone for the asset. This decisive breach of the range confirms a major shift in momentum and signals the end of a prolonged phase of stagnant price action. Related Reading: Dogecoin On Edge — 2.5 Days Remain To Lock In Breakout Springboard The validity of this breakout is further reinforced by a crucial technical indicator: rising volume. As Dogecoin pushed higher, the increased trading volume served as a powerful signal of conviction from the buyers. This strong backing indicates that the move was not a fleeting event but rather a genuine surge of interest, with significant capital flowing into the asset. Following its strong rally, Dogecoin is currently experiencing a healthy and expected pullback from the resistance zone between $0.29 and $0.30. However, this slight retreat is a positive and natural part of a strong uptrend, as it allows the market to consolidate and prevents the rally from becoming overheated. According to the expert, this pullback is presenting a strategic opportunity for traders. Alpha Crypto Signal suggests that any retest of the breakout level, specifically the $0.24 to $0.25 zone, could offer a solid long opportunity. As long as Dogecoin can hold above this crucial zone and maintain its overall bullish structure, the positive momentum from the breakout is expected to continue. Dogecoin Pattern Repeats: History Points To Another Pump In a recent post on X, crypto analyst CryptoELlTES has revealed a compelling observation about Dogecoin’s price history. He asserts that a specific technical pattern is repeating itself on the chart, one that has consistently preceded every major Dogecoin pump in the past. This historical correlation suggests that the current setup is highly significant. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready To Bark Again? Analyst Sees Path To $0.45 According to the analysis, Dogecoin is at the final stage of this “1-2 pattern.” The chart displays the same formation that previously launched the asset into several parabolic moves. Since the market is showing the same bullish behavior that has historically led to explosive growth for the coin, a major upward move could be on the horizon.

52038192,https://timestabloid.com/?p=83887,1758423635,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top 3 Most Trending Altcoins in September and Why This Rising Star Takes the Spotlight,https://timestabloid.com/top-3-most-trending-altcoins-in-september-and-why-this-rising/,"Altcoins are once again at the center of market conversations as traders look beyond Bitcoin for the next big move. September has been unusually active for digital assets, with fresh rallies, community-driven hype, and institutional interest shaping momentum. Among the top names leading the way this month are Dogecoin, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE , the latter of which analysts say could deliver as much as 50x returns in this bull market cycle. Dogecoin Rides Meme Momentum and ETF Speculation Dogecoin continues to prove its staying power in the crypto landscape. Despite being launched as a meme coin, DOGE has built one of the most loyal communities in digital assets. September has brought renewed excitement, as investors speculate about the possibility of a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) coming to U.S. markets. While still in early discussions, the mere prospect of a DOGE ETF has fueled optimism that mainstream institutions could one day have easier access to the meme coin that started it all. Trading around the mid-$0.20s, Dogecoin has shown surprising resilience. Investors are watching closely to see whether ETF speculation and community-driven campaigns can push DOGE higher in the coming weeks. With its unique blend of cultural influence and potential institutional recognition, Dogecoin remains one of the most talked-about altcoins this September. MAGACOIN FINANCE Becomes the Rising Star While Dogecoin and XRP benefit from ETF speculation and established ecosystems, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the breakout rising star of 2025 . Still in its early stages, the project has already attracted thousands of participants into its presale and continues to expand at a remarkable pace. Analysts are now projecting that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 50x returns , echoing the kind of exponential growth seen by early adopters of DOGE and XRP in past cycles. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its ability to capture both community energy and whale participation at the same time. Retail investors are flooding into the presale, while larger holders who previously concentrated on Bitcoin and XRP are diversifying into this new opportunity. With momentum building fast, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being tipped as one of the most promising altcoins of the cycle — not as a rival to established giants, but as a fresh vehicle for those chasing outsized returns. XRP Gains Institutional Momentum With ETF Buzz XRP has also been making significant noise this month. With its market capitalization climbing back above $180 billion, XRP recently overtook several major corporations in valuation, cementing its position as a top-tier crypto asset. The token has consistently traded above the $3 level during September, and optimism continues to grow around the pending launch of an XRP ETF in the United States. According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, the long-anticipated REX-Osprey ETF is likely to receive approval soon, potentially arriving before the end of the month. Such a product would mark a historic milestone for XRP, opening the door for institutional inflows and making it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity service, which powers global cross-border payments, already provides XRP with strong real-world use cases. Combined with the ETF narrative, many analysts see potential targets of $6 or even $13 if bullish momentum continues. Why These Altcoins Dominate September Together, Dogecoin, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE reflect the different dynamics driving today’s altcoin market. Dogecoin shows the power of cultural momentum, reinforced by ETF hype that could one day bring it into the institutional spotlight. XRP combines utility with legitimacy, using Ripple’s payment network to secure real-world adoption while an ETF looms as a potential game changer for liquidity. MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the thrill of early-stage investing, where small stakes can translate into significant gains if growth continues. The common denominator is visibility. In September, each of these projects has managed to capture investor attention in a unique way, shaping narratives that extend beyond price movements alone. Conclusion Altcoins are once again leading the conversation in crypto. Dogecoin continues to ride its meme-powered momentum while investors speculate on the possibility of a DOGE ETF. XRP has captured institutional attention, with its own ETF likely to launch soon, marking a defining moment for its market. And at the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as the rising star , with analysts projecting as much as 50x returns for early investors. Together, these three projects highlight the range of opportunities available in the altcoin market — from cultural icons to institutional plays to breakout newcomers.

Developers are pushing forward with the XLS-86 Firewall , a proposed feature that could slow or block suspicious transactions before they empty accounts. It marks a turning point for investor protection on XRPL, which until now has relied heavily on users safeguarding their own wallets. As this milestone nears, some large XRP holders are also exploring other high-growth opportunities, with MAGACOIN FINANCE emerging as a surprising destination for whales looking to diversify . A New Firewall for XRPL The XLS-86 Firewall is being designed to stop attacks at the transaction level, offering users the ability to control how their funds move. Unlike complex multisignature setups, this system is built to be user-friendly, allowing both individuals and businesses to activate rules without deep technical knowledge. At its core, the firewall introduces two simple but powerful tools: transaction thresholds and time delays. Users will be able to set caps on how much can leave their accounts in a given window or delay large withdrawals for several hours. If hackers compromise a wallet, these restrictions could give the real owner time to react, preventing instant losses. Another key feature is whitelisting, which allows trusted addresses to bypass restrictions. Everyday transactions – like paying a supplier or transferring funds between personal accounts – would remain seamless. The balance between strict protection and practical usability is what makes XLS-86 different from earlier solutions. Why It Matters Now Scams targeting XRP holders have grown more sophisticated, from phishing links to fake airdrops. Just recently, Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz warned about a fraudulent campaign making the rounds online. With billions at stake, the community has been demanding more proactive protections. Up until now, personal responsibility has been the mantra: keep private keys safe, avoid suspicious links, or use cold storage. But these measures still leave gaps, especially for newcomers. Once a wallet is compromised, the XRP Ledger itself offers no built-in defense – funds can vanish in seconds. The proposed firewall could change that dynamic. Instead of leaving users entirely exposed, XRPL would embed a layer of protection into its codebase, giving investors a fighting chance against criminals. For many, this signals a broader philosophical shift: security should be part of the network, not just the responsibility of individuals. Altcoin Contender Captures Whale Attention While XRP developers focus on strengthening defenses, some whales are hedging their bets by entering MAGACOIN FINANCE , a fast-growing presale project that has already made waves in 2025. What makes this move notable is the scale of migration: investors known for holding large amounts of XRP are now channeling capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE, signaling growing confidence in its potential. Unlike traditional presales, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emphasized speed and accessibility, onboarding thousands of users in just weeks. Its model allows whales to secure positions early while still giving retail participants a fair entry point – a balance rarely seen in early-stage crypto ventures. This unique structure has fueled speculation that MAGACOIN FINANCE could rise as one of the most community-driven projects of the current bull cycle. Some analysts even argue that its growth pace is already outpacing rivals in the same stage, making it a top altcoin to watch heading into 2026. A Turning Point for Investor Protection Back in the XRP camp, the XLS-86 Firewall may represent more than just a technical upgrade. If widely adopted, it could serve as a model for how blockchains approach investor safety. Instead of assuming that users will always act flawlessly, the network itself would provide a fallback mechanism. This is a significant shift from the traditional crypto ethos of total self-custody, where responsibility lies entirely with the individual. By embedding security features directly into XRPL, developers are acknowledging the reality that scams remain a persistent threat, and stronger safeguards are needed to encourage wider adoption. Other blockchains are likely watching closely. If XLS-86 proves effective, Ethereum, Solana, and other ecosystems could consider similar tools. The crypto industry has often been criticized for leaving newcomers vulnerable, and innovations like this could help bridge that trust gap. What Comes Next The firewall proposal is still in the development stage, and activation will ultimately depend on community adoption. Importantly, the system will remain optional – users can decide whether to enable the rules based on their own comfort with security. This flexibility could drive widespread adoption, avoiding the pitfalls of overly rigid safeguards. For XRP, the timing is critical. The asset has remained one of the most widely used tokens in global payments but continues to face challenges from scammers targeting its large retail base. By strengthening defenses, XRPL could enhance its reputation as one of the safest blockchains for both individuals and institutions. Conclusion XRP’s planned firewall marks a potential breakthrough in blockchain security, signaling a new era where networks take a more active role in protecting users. If implemented successfully, XLS-86 could set a precedent for the entire industry. At the same time, large XRP investors diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE shows how the bull market is opening doors for projects with rapid adoption and unique community-driven models. Together, these developments highlight the dual story of crypto in 2025 – improving safety for established tokens while creating fresh opportunities for ambitious newcomers.

52043003,585780,1758427224,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52043003.jpeg,FTX To Release $1.6 Billion In Creditor Repayments Sept. 30 – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-to-release-1-6-billion-in-creditor-repayments-sept-30-details/,"Reports have disclosed that the FTX Recovery Trust is preparing to release another $1.6 billion to its creditors by September 30. The payout marks the third distribution since the exchange collapsed in late 2022, and payments are expected to reach verified claimants within three business days once they are processed through BitGo, Kraken, or Payoneer. FTX: Breakdown Of Payout Classes The upcoming release will be divided among several groups. US customer claims will get an additional 40% this round, pushing their total recovery to about 95%. International customers under the dotcom entity will receive another 6%, bringing them closer to 78% overall. General unsecured creditors, along with those holding digital asset loan claims, will see 24% more, which raises their cumulative recovery to nearly 85%. Convenience claims are also being settled in full, with reports stating they will receive 120% compared to their original claims. These are usually smaller cases that are handled quickly to reduce costs and speed up the overall process. Verification And Distribution Creditors who want to access the payout must have completed all required verification steps. The trust has already urged claimants to confirm their chosen payment channel before the deadline, as unverified accounts risk delays. Once released, the funds are expected to clear into accounts within days, giving long-awaited relief to thousands who lost money in the collapse. The payment in September is part of a larger FTX recovery process that has earmarked as much as $16.5 billion in assets to be returned to creditors. While progress has been steady, many customers have still complained about the freezing of valuations at their November 2022 prices. At that time, digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ether traded far below the levels that would occur in 2025. FTX: Questions On Fairness Remain The question of fairness remains. Smaller convenience claims receive more than what they lost, while large creditors argue theirs should be weighed against the stagnant valuations of their assets. This was intended under the company’s legal documents to facilitate administration and avoid extensive litigation, but it raised the ire of foreign creditors that have greater impediments than creditors situated in the US. For now, the $1.6 billion payment is yet another milestone to the FTX rescue process, but it does not solve all the complaints. With billions already paid out in previous rounds, the trust is still under pressure to continue disbursing and to finally bring closure to one of the largest cryptocurrency bankruptcies in history.

Each stands out for different reasons. One has a strong history, while the other promises new ideas. Which one is better for the future? A closer look at both could reveal surprising strengths and weaknesses. Readers may rethink which one truly leads the way. Chainlink (LINK) Source: TradingView LINK slipped less than 0.1% this week, but it still gained 3.82% over the past month and 71.71% over 6 months. The coin now trades between $22.38 and $25.77, hugging the 10-day average at $24.62 and sitting above the 100-day line at $23.75. This keeps buyers alert even after the tiny weekly pullback. Momentum tools flash neutral to mild bullish. RSI sits at 53.44 and Stochastic at 47.44, both mid-field. MACD stays slightly positive at 0.1599, hinting at steady upward bias. With price perched just under the nearest roof at $27, bulls need only a modest push to flip short-term sentiment. Failure to break could trigger fast profit taking. A close above $27 would open the path to the next cap at $31, roughly 25% above the lower end of today’s band. If that level falls, mid-term targets stretch beyond but the chart offers no higher checkpoints yet. On the flip side, a dip below $20.62 would shave about 15% and expose $17.24, a zone 30% lower. For now, sideways-up bias prevails. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price , far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster, who has close to 1 million followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “the best memecoin for sports fans.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.0055 by Stage 17, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Conclusion LINK offers solid long-term value.

XRP Army Reacts",https://timestabloid.com/pundit-be-honest-10000-per-xrp-before-end-of-2030-xrp-army-reacts/,"Crypto enthusiast JackTheRippler posed a direct question on social media regarding XRP’s long-term price potential. The post asked followers to consider whether they believed XRP could realistically reach $10,000 per token by the end of 2030. The post was framed as an open-ended prompt for opinions and drew a range of responses from the community, with perspectives covering both the feasibility and the challenges of such an outcome. Be honest, $10,000 per #XRP before end of 2030? pic.twitter.com/TXkj1G3wsF — JackTheRippler ©️ (@RippleXrpie) September 19, 2025 Current Trading Price and Required Growth The backdrop of this conversation is XRP’s current market value. According to data from CoinMarketCap, XRP is presently trading around $3. This means a target of $10,000 would require an increase of approximately 333,233%. Such a valuation would significantly reshape the cryptocurrency market structure and would result in one of the largest capitalizations ever witnessed in financial history. Community Reactions to the $10,000 Projection In response to the question, several community members offered calculations and scenarios. One commenter, identified as Susanna, emphasized the scale of the proposed figure by stating that if XRP were to reach $10,000, its market capitalization would approach $1,000 trillion. She implied that this level would be far beyond current global financial benchmarks. Another user, Daphne, noted that while the number is large, it should not be dismissed outright. She emphasized the importance of several key factors that must align, including widespread adoption, regulatory clarity, and demonstrable utility. She described the target as ambitious but said it was not entirely impossible under the right circumstances. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Critical Views on Market Reality Other responses questioned the practicality of the projection. A user named Sunild addressed the issue from a critical perspective, suggesting that such figures could be interpreted as unrealistic hype. He acknowledged owning XRP but pointed out that with a price of $3 today, reaching $10,000 per coin would require unprecedented market transformations. He asked whether such targets implied that the XRP Ledger would replace global financial infrastructures such as the SWIFT system , underscoring his skepticism about the feasibility of that scenario. The post ultimately highlights the ongoing debate within the XRP community about future valuations. While some participants see the possibility of extraordinary growth given XRP’s role in cross-border payments and discussions around utility, others remain cautious, pointing to the need for more grounded projections that reflect achievable adoption paths and market realities. Although JackTheRippler’s post did not provide a direct prediction, it has opened space for examination of what such a valuation would mean in terms of global capital and whether XRP’s current trajectory could support it within the stated timeframe.

This article explores the best crypto to buy and ride the altcoin season that may happen as monetary conditions ease. Best crypto to buy after the Fed cuts The best cryptocurrencies to buy after the Fed started cutting interest rates are those with strong fundamentals and technicals. Some of them are tokens like XRP, Keeta, Solana, and Hyperliquid. Keeta Keeta is a new crypto project backed by Eric Schmidt, the former Google CEO. It is a major blockchain project that aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the blockchain, helped by the ability to process over 1 million transactions per second. The main catalyst for the Keeta price will be the upcoming mainnet launch, which will happen this week. Historically, cryptocurrencies do well when there is a major development, such as a mainnet launch or an exchange listing. In Keeta’s case, the mainnet launch could lead to more exchange listings, which will push it higher. A good example of a coin that surged recently was Somnia, whose token surged to a record high after it launched its mainnet. XRP Ripple(XRP) is the other main crypto to buy for big gains. It has both fundamental and technical catalysts. First, the recently launched spot XRP ETF , which is based on the Investment Company Act of 1940, has started well, with some of the best volumes. It has also crossed the $10 million asset mark in the past two days. Second, the Securities and Exchange Commission will likely approve the Act 33 ETFs by companies like Franklin Templeton, Invesco, Bitwise, and Canary in October when the deadline arrives. With the expensive Rex-Osprey XRP ETF seeing robust inflows, there is a possibility that these funds will do much better. Analysts predict that these funds will have over $8 billion in inflows in the first 12 months after launch, which will boost its price. The XRP price also has strong technicals. It remains above the 100-day Exponential Moving Average, and has formed the highly positive bullish flag pattern. The coin has also formed a cup-and-handle, pointing to a strong surge in the coming weeks. XRP price chart | Source: TradingView Hyperliquid (HYPE) Hyperliquid token is another top crypto to buy as the Fed cuts interest rates. It has some of the best fundamentals in the crypto industry, with its platform processing hundreds of billions of dollars in volume every month. DeFi Llama data shows that the network handled over $315 billion in volume in the last 30 days, much higher than Lighter, which handled $131 billion and Aster, which processed tokens worth $19 billion. HYPE price will surge ahead of the upcoming USDH stablecoin launch and as its token burns and buybacks. HYPE price chart | Source: TradingView Hyperliquid’s token also has strong bullish technicals. It has formed an ascending triangle pattern, which it has already flipped. The current pullback is likely part of a break-and-retest pattern, which often leads to more gains. Therefore, the coin will likely drop to $50 and then bounce back to $100 in the longer term. Solana (SOL) Solana is another top crypto to buy because of its strong fundamentals and catalysts. One of the catalysts is the upcoming SOL ETF approvals by the SEC. As the biggest rival to Ethereum, there is a possibility that the SOL ETFs will have strong gains once approved. Solana price will also benefit from the upcoming alpenglow upgrade that will introduce new features. Some of the most notable features are its transition into a proof-of-stake network and the surge in its throughput.

Solana has been leading recent rallies, drawing attention back to high-performance blockchains. But analysts say Cardano (ADA) is on the verge of a breakout, with upgrades and whale accumulation supporting a bullish narrative. Alongside these established names, the presale scene is showing signs of life – where MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly earned “gem status” thanks to its audited structure and surging early demand. ADA’s Price Position and Breakout Potential Cardano is currently trading around $0.86–$0.92 , with strong resistance just below the $1 mark. Traders are watching the $0.95–$1.00 level as the key to unlocking higher moves. A break above this psychological barrier could send ADA toward $1.10–$1.20 in the near term. With its market cap hovering around $30 billion, ADA remains a top contender among altcoins, and whales have recently been expanding their positions – often a sign of growing confidence ahead of major moves. Upgrades That Could Redefine Cardano’s Future One of Cardano’s strengths is its roadmap of upgrades. Hydra, its scaling solution, promises to drastically increase throughput and efficiency, reducing costs for users and developers. Smart contract improvements are also underway, making the network more competitive against rivals like Solana and Ethereum. The team’s academic approach and emphasis on formal verification give ADA an image of durability and long-term reliability. While Solana impresses with speed, Cardano appeals to those who value security and steady progress. Analysts’ Forecasts for ADA in the Coming Months Short-term forecasts suggest that ADA could push to $1.20 by year-end if momentum holds. Medium-term projections see ADA potentially climbing toward $1.80–$2.50 over the next few years, provided adoption expands and technical execution stays on track. However, if ADA fails to break resistance or if broader markets weaken, prices could stagnate in the $0.80–$1.00 range. Some skeptics believe Cardano’s slower development cycle risks leaving it behind faster-moving rivals. A Rising Presale Gem Catching Early Investors’ Eyes While ADA and SOL fight for dominance, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a completely different kind of opportunity . Early participants are calling it a hidden gem because of its unusual momentum for a presale. The project has already been fully audited, ensuring transparency and security. Each presale stage is selling out faster than expected, pointing to high demand and limited supply. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE especially compelling is its timing. With presale hype returning in 2025 and altcoin season potentially near, investors are actively searching for tokens with the potential to multiply quickly. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers exactly that – strong fundamentals, early entry, and scarcity. For many, it feels like catching ADA or SOL before they became household names. How Cardano Stacks Up Against Solana’s Momentum Solana’s speed and thriving DeFi ecosystem make it a formidable rival, but Cardano’s strength lies in its measured approach and community support. Where Solana dominates with raw performance, Cardano focuses on resilience and scalability over the long term. This contrast sets up a fascinating narrative for the next bull market. If ADA delivers on Hydra and other upgrades, it could reclaim ground lost to faster-moving chains. In that case, investors holding both SOL and ADA may benefit, with projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offering a higher-risk, higher-reward complement. Altcoin Season Could Redraw the Market Map If Ethereum’s push higher continues and ETF inflows bring new liquidity, smaller altcoins could see explosive gains. This is the environment where ADA could shine, and where presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE thrive. Volatility cuts both ways, but historically, these are the moments when fortunes are made in crypto. Altcoin season tends to redraw the market map, elevating projects that once seemed obscure into front-page leaders. ADA has a chance to ride that wave, and MAGACOIN FINANCE could ride it even harder. Conclusion Cardano is standing on the edge of a breakout, with its technical roadmap and whale accumulation suggesting higher prices ahead. Solana continues to lead in performance, but ADA’s slow and steady strategy may yet pay off in the next phase of the bull cycle. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention as one of the few presales to achieve gem status so early. With audits complete, stages selling out, and community traction rising, it is quickly becoming one of the standout altcoins to watch. For investors, the combination of ADA’s breakout potential and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive upside creates a powerful one-two punch heading into the final months of 2025.

The AI platform suggests modest gains for established meme coins Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu coin (SHIB). However, Grok’s most exciting prediction involves a new Ethereum Layer 2 phenomenon that’s capturing market attention. Layer Brett’s unique combination of technology and meme culture positions it for potentially explosive growth. According to the AI’s in-depth analysis. So investors are keeping a close eye on this emerging project. Grok’s outlook on established meme coins The AI predicts Dogecoin will see moderate appreciation based on current trends. Shiba Inu coin faces stronger headwinds due to concerns about supply inflation. Both tokens suffer from massive market caps that limit percentage gains. Grok notes that while community support remains strong. Technological limitations constrain growth potential. These predictions suggest respectable but limited returns for established meme coins like DOGE and SHIB. Why Layer Brett stands out in AI analysis Grok’s analysis highlights Layer Brett’s technological advantages as key differentiators. The Ethereum Layer 2 foundation offers genuine utility beyond mere speculation. The AI recognizes the platform’s transaction speed and cost advantages. These fundamental factors support more optimistic price predictions. The analysis suggests Layer Brett could significantly outperform established meme coins. Technological edge over competitors Layer Brett processes transactions significantly faster than base layer Ethereum. Fees remain minimal regardless of network congestion levels. This practical utility drives organic adoption from actual users. The technological foundation supports sustainable growth beyond social media hype. These advantages caught Grok AI’s attention in its analysis. Community momentum and adoption rates The presale has raised nearly $4 million. Showing strong market validation. Social media engagement grows exponentially across multiple platforms. Community enthusiasm matches the best meme coin launches in history. Decreasing staking rewards indicate rapidly expanding participation. This organic growth suggests sustainable momentum beyond artificial hype. Market factors supporting Layer Brett’s growth Ethereum’s scalability issues highlight Layer 2 importance. Meme coin evolution demands fresh concepts with substance. Investors seek projects offering both excitement and utility. Current market conditions perfectly favor Layer Brett’s value proposition. These factors combine to create ideal growth conditions. Investment implications of AI predictions Grok’s analysis suggests diversifying beyond established meme coins. Layer Brett’s micro-cap status allows exponential growth potential. The risk-reward profile appeals to growth-focused investors. Smart allocations might include both stability and growth components. This balanced approach manages risk while capturing upside. Why timing matters for maximum returns The presale phase offers entry before even broader recognition. Each stage completion brings price increases that reduce potential returns. Current market conditions particularly favor Layer Brett’s value proposition. Early positioning typically yields the best results in crypto markets. This window with incredible value and upside potential won’t remain open indefinitely. You’ll want to jump in early for the best possible returns. Conclusion: Embracing AI-informed investment decisions Grok’s predictions suggest growth for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. But even more exciting potential for Layer Brett investors. The combination of AI analysis and fundamental factors creates a compelling case. The presale window won’t last forever as stages advance regularly. Run over to layerbrett.com today to join the party. Secure your tokens at the current price of $0.0058 before it increases again.

Exchange reserves fall to June 2022 lows, tightening supply while large investors increase accumulation. Whale Accumulation Signals Rising Interest Large holders have been active in the Chainlink market in a 2-day manner at the end of the business week. Wallets holding between 100,000 and 1,000,000 LINK added nearly 2 million tokens in just 48 hours, according to data shared by Ali Martinez. LINK was trading near $24 at press time, with the price movement stable despite the inflow of buying. Meanwhile, this kind of activity often shows growing confidence among large investors. He noted, Whales bought nearly 2 million Chainlink $LINK in the last 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/ZHlX81KBBl — Ali (@ali_charts) September 19, 2025 Pennant Structure Marks Key Levels for LINK A closer look at the 12-hour chart shows a bullish pennant formation, marked by converging support and resistance lines. LINK is trading around $24, close to the pattern’s upper boundary. Analyst Batman described the formation as “a very clean bullish pennant pattern.” The chart shows resistance forming near $25–$26.00 and support holding around $22–$23, an area that also aligns with a fair value gap. According to Batman, traders are watching these levels as key points within the pennant structure, with a breakout or retest likely to provide clearer direction. Source: Batman/X On the weekly chart against Bitcoin, Michaël van de Poppe highlighted LINK as one of the stronger setups in the market. LINK is trading near 0.0002081 BTC, still below its major resistance. Van de Poppe pointed to 0.0004389 BTC as the key level to clear. A breakout above that zone could open the way for a move of more than 160% relative to Bitcoin. He described LINK as having “one of the best setups in the space, right now,” with momentum slowly building after a long consolidation. Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Exchange Reserves Continue to Fall Data from CryptoQuant shows that LINK balances on exchanges have dropped to about 159 million, the lowest figure since June 2022. Reserves had previously been above 200 million, but the steady decline means fewer tokens are available for immediate sale. Source: CryptoQuant With LINK trading near $24, this reduction in available supply may create tighter conditions if buying interest grows. Traders are watching whether the combination of whale accumulation, chart patterns, and shrinking reserves will translate into stronger price action in the weeks ahead.

New buyers are rushing to secure positions before exchange listings and bonus offers expire. MAGACOIN FINANCE nears 18,500 investors MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing fresh attention as it closes in on 18,500 investors. The timing has fueled FOMO as more people join daily. The altcoin is positioning itself as a hedge and safe option during market crashes, offering both diversification and security thanks to its audits and verified structure. What’s adding to the buzz is the limited-time PATRIOT50X bonus code, giving early buyers a 50% extra allocation. This makes now a rare chance to enter before the bonus window closes and before listings on exchanges begin. The project markets itself as a safe and secure environment, making it a serious candidate for those searching for the best altcoin to buy now. Early entry advantage with MAGACOIN FINANCE With the price still under $0.0005, many believe this is the ideal entry point before it moves higher. Analysts point out that reaching $0.01 could be within reach once exchange listings arrive, effectively canceling two zeros for those who enter now. Smart money tends to move early, and the urgency in this case is clear—every hour counts as new investors continue to join. Solana (SOL) and Tron (TRX) enter the spotlight Solana (SOL) is being tipped by market commentators for a breakout in Q4 2025. Scott Melker, known as the Wolf of All Streets, suggested that Solana could regain momentum thanks to its high-speed network, treasury demand, and the possibility of ETF approvals. He noted October 10 as a key date when the SEC is set to decide on Solana ETF applications. If approvals come, marketing campaigns and inflows could drive a new rally. At the same time, TRON (TRX) is showing strong network activity and structural growth. Its circulating USDT supply has grown by over $23 billion this year, now making up nearly half of all Tether in existence. Analysts suggest that TRX’s structure mirrors past breakout setups, with paths toward $0.50 in the near term and possibly higher levels longer term. On top of this, TRON now leads blockchain revenues with more than $1 million in daily earnings, strengthening its long-term case. With both SOL and TRX seeing strong narratives and on-chain support, they remain top picks alongside MAGACOIN FINANCE for traders seeking the best altcoins to buy now. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Urgency builds The clock is ticking. MAGACOIN FINANCE keeps adding thousands of new investors each week, and exchange listings are on the horizon. The limited PATRIOT50X code makes this an attractive entry point before bonuses expire. With audited security and a safe project structure, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a compelling diversification opportunity in a volatile market. Final take The search for the best altcoins to buy now points clearly to Solana, TRX, and MAGACOIN FINANCE. With ETFs on the horizon for SOL, network expansion for TRX, and a growing investor base plus bonus incentives for MAGACOIN FINANCE, traders have a unique chance to position early.

Related Reading: Pundit Predicts XRP Price Crash Below $3, Here’s Why ADA Price Structure Suggests Bullish Breakout Ahead, Analyst Says In a recent X post, Martinez provides some technical insight into the Cardano market, which highlights the potential for a significant price move based on historical price behavior and Fibonacci extension levels. Notably, Martinez’s analysis shows how ADA previously topped between the 1.000 and 1.272 Fibonacci extension in its last bull run and appears to be showing similar technical structure this time around. For context, the Fibonacci extension tool is widely used to identify possible price targets by mapping ratios derived from the Fibonacci sequence against historical price action. In Cardano’s last cycle, ADA surged from lows near $0.018 in early 2020 to highs around $3.10 in 2021 as the cycle peak. At the time of writing, ADA is consolidating near the 0.618 extension level at $1.15. This zone has historically acted as both strong resistance and support, making it a critical battleground for bulls and bears. If ADA can decisively break above $1.15, Martinez’s projections suggest momentum could build toward higher Fibonacci extension targets, most notably in the $3-$6 range. Such a move would represent a substantial upside from current levels, with about a 200% gain alone required just to reach the $3 threshold that aligns with the 1.000 extension level. Meanwhile, achieving the upper end of the projection near $6 would put Cardano back in contention with its 2021 highs, which aligns with the 1.272 Fibonacci extension level. However, it’s worth noting that a rejection at $1.15 resistance level could force Cardano to lower levels at $0.62 (0.382 Fib) and $0.43 (0.236 Fib).

The daily trading volume has also dropped sharply by 49.53%, signaling reduced activity and waning momentum among traders. Meanwhile, recent on-chain data highlights significant whale movements, with over 530 million ADA ($472 million) offloaded within the past 72 hours, according to Ali Martinez. Such large-scale selling often indicates profit-taking or repositioning by major holders, adding to bearish sentiment. Despite this, ADA continues to rank as the 10th largest cryptocurrency with a total market cap of $32.03 billion.

A breakout could target $0.60, yet token unlocks and thin order books keep pressure on price. With about 4.5 million PI released daily and liquidity scattered, rallies fade fast. Traders treat PI as the new altcoin to watch, but not the best crypto to buy now until demand outpaces supply. A firm reclaim above $0.35 with volume would be the first signal. SUI: Users, Throughput, And Strategic Partnerships At $3.68, SUI trends in higher highs and lows near its channel floor. On-chain data shows strong DeFi traction, multi-billion TVL, and heavy daily activity, plus a Google tie-up for AI payments and ETF interest from 21Shares, Canary Capital, and Tuttle.

Then the Crash,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-next-leg-up-will-be-fast-and-euphoric-i-will-sell-most-will-buy-then-the-crash/,"Crypto enthusiast CryptoBull has shared a perspective on XRP’s performance and what may lie ahead for the digital asset. In his statement, he highlighted the journey of XRP from its price of $0.11 in March 2020 to $3.66 in July 2025. According to him, this growth has not been straightforward, as the market has been characterized by negativity, doubt, frustration, and fear throughout this period. He added that while the market has experienced these conditions, the next upward move will be fast and euphoric. CryptoBull’s Outlook on Market Movements In his post, CryptoBull made clear that he intends to sell during the anticipated rapid rise, while he expects the majority of investors will be in a buying phase. He further predicted that this would eventually lead to a downturn, suggesting that a crash would follow the euphoric stage of the cycle. His perspective reflects the classic notion of market cycles, where optimism is often followed by corrections when sentiment and positioning become overheated. The #XRP run from $0.11 in March of 2020 to $3.66 in July of 2025 has been filled with negativity, doubt, frustration and fear. The next leg up will be fast and euphoric. I will sell. Most will buy. Then the crash. — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) September 19, 2025 Reactions from Community Members The post drew varied reactions from community members. Word Noise responded by pointing out that a crash cannot occur without a preceding bull run, emphasizing that this expectation of a collapse is misplaced unless a strong upward movement has occurred. He further stated that if the market were truly entering a new phase, it would be less about speculation and more about utility and adoption, implying that the sustainability of XRP’s value would rest on real-world usage rather than short-term cycles. The Mighty Sween also offered his view, expressing that he has been struggling to identify his own exit strategy. He mentioned that while he does not want to miss a significant upward move in the market, he is already up six times on his investment and does not want to mismanage his gains. His comment reflects the internal conflict faced by many investors, balancing between potential profits and risk management. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another user, tsarT, provided a contrasting stance, asserting that the crash has already begun. He stated that XRP will not surpass $3.66 for at least the next decade and predicted that the next move will be a sharp decline back to $0.30. He further expressed a desire for speculative traders to be removed from the market through such declines, suggesting a reset in participation. Diverging Views on XRP’s Future The range of comments in response to CryptoBull’s post illustrates the differences in outlook on XRP’s future. Some emphasize the potential of adoption and utility to drive long-term growth, while others focus on near-term price movements and cycle dynamics. CryptoBull’s warning of a euphoric rise followed by a crash highlights the risks of volatility, while community reactions show that investor expectations remain highly divided.

Lower rates normally lead to more demand for risky assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. This article provides the forecasts for top coins like Avantis (AVNT), Lista DAO (LISTA), and Aeva (AEVA). Avantis price technical analysis Avantis has been one of the best-performing tokens this month as it jumped by over 500% from its lowest level. It has jumped because of the ongoing demand for its platform whose volume has jumped sharply. Also, on-chain data points to heavy whale and smart money accumulation this year. Most importantly, some analysts have pointed to market manipulation, citing the numerous sybil accounts in the network. The hourly chart shows that the AVNT price surged to a record high of above $2 on Sunday, much higher than this month’s low of $0.2045. It has moved above the important resistance level at $1.5845, the highest swing on September 15. The coin also moved above the 50-period moving average, while the Relative Strength Index and other oscillators have jumped. Therefore, the Avantis price token will likely continue soaring as bulls target the next key resistance level at $3. However, a drop to the key support level at $1.5845, the highest point on September 1, is possible as the coin forms the bullish break-and-retest pattern. AVNT price chart | Source: TradingView Aevo price prediction The Aevo token price has remained in a tight range in the past few months. It has remained inside the key support and resistance levels at $0.0743 and $0.1360. This performance is mostly because it has had no major catalyst in this period, with its perpetual future volume falling. The coin has recently moved above the 50-day moving average, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has pointed upwards and moved close to the overbought point at 70. There are signs that the Aevo price is now in the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory. This phase is normally followed by markup, where the demand is usually higher than the supply. Therefore, the token will likely have a strong bullish breakout, with the next key point to watch being at $0.1585, the highest point on May 13. Aevo price chart | Source: TradingView Lista DAO price analysis Lista, a top player in the BNB network, has also soared as the Binance Coin price has jumped to a record high. The LISTA token jumped from a low of $0.1116 in September last year to a high of $0.45 today. Lista price chart | Source: TradingView Lista token has moved above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues rising. Therefore, the token will likely continue soaring, with the next point to watch being the psychological level at $0.50.

With its active development community, long-term focus on scalability, and ongoing integrations, ADA remains one of the most closely followed digital assets in the cryptocurrency market. Analysts, traders, and automated forecasting tools have been providing a wide range of outlooks on where the asset may stand in the coming weeks. Among these, ChatGPT has also presented an outlook on ADA’s possible trajectory for October 1, 2025, based on a mix of current trading data and sentiment in the market. Current Market Position At present, ADA is trading in the $0.89 to $0.90 range. In recent sessions, the coin has tested intraday highs near $0.93 while facing support levels close to $0.88. Market researchers have highlighted that ADA is approaching a critical resistance point near $0.95, which, if broken, could open the way toward stronger upside momentum. Sources such as blockchain-focused research outlets have suggested that ADA could potentially climb toward the $1.10 to $1.21 range in the near term, provided that bullish sentiment continues and macroeconomic conditions remain supportive. On the other hand, some more conservative projections have placed ADA between $0.90 and $1.05 as a more realistic near-term window, taking into account recent price consolidations. ChatGPT’s Cardano (ADA) Price Forecast When asked about ADA’s near-term outlook, ChatGPT provided a structured forecast. According to the model, “Here’s what I think is plausible for ADA on October 1, 2025: Likely range: $1.00 to $1.15. Mid-scenario (‘base case’): about $1.05. Bullish case (if momentum holds, resistance breaks, favorable macro): up to $1.20. Bearish case (if market pulls back, negative macro, failure at resistance): could drop back toward $0.80–$0.90.” This forecast reflects both the opportunities and risks facing ADA as it approaches a critical market window. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Technical and Market Considerations The projection aligns with the broader technical signals being observed. ADA has been moving within a relatively narrow consolidation band for much of September, suggesting that a breakout could be imminent. If the coin secures a decisive move above $0.95, the likelihood of approaching the $1.10 range strengthens. Conversely, failure to sustain buying pressure could lead to further consolidation below $0.90, delaying any significant rally into October. Factors That Could Influence Price Beyond technical considerations, macroeconomic factors will play a role in determining ADA’s performance. Global risk sentiment, regulatory developments, and broader cryptocurrency market dynamics have been influencing investor decisions throughout 2025. A stronger inflow into digital assets could reinforce ADA’s bullish potential, while any downturn in risk appetite may curb momentum. As October 1 approaches, Cardano remains a coin to watch closely. The combined views from market analysts and tools like ChatGPT highlights a reasonable expectation for Cardano (ADA) to trade within the $1.00 to $1.15 range, while acknowledging the possibility of either a higher push toward $1.20 or a fallback to support levels near $0.85.

This Is What Pioneers Need to Know,https://cryptopotato.com/pi-networks-grand-upgrade-is-completed-this-is-what-pioneers-need-to-know/,"TL;DR A popular account dedicated to covering Pi Network news posted a picture that the protocol’s big update has been completed, even though there’s no official confirmation from the team. Pi Network’s devs have been quite active in the past few weeks with new upgrades, but that’s yet to benefit the underlying asset’s price. BREAKING: Pi Network testnet has been upgraded to protocol v23! pic.twitter.com/ttqIq1Bew2 — Pi News (@PiNewsMedia) September 19, 2025 Is V23 Finally Here? Recall that the Pi Network Core Team announced notable changes a few months ago, which included the upgrade of the protocol version from v19 at the time to v23. Although it’s based on Stellar v23, it has been custom-designed for Pi Network, enabling more control and new functionalities for users. Some of those include embedding Know-Your-Customer (KYC) authorities into the protocol that aim to maintain the entire Pi Network ecosystem as a KYC-verified blockchain. At first, there was no particular timeframe given for the upgrade rollout. However, Pi News continued to monitor the situation and posted a progress review a week ago, which outlined that the Testnet had been updated to v22. Now, the Testnet says that it runs on the latest version, but the community is still expecting an official confirmation and status update from the official Pi Network Core Team. While they await such a statement, the team recently introduced a new solution that could speed up the KYC verification process. It’s called Fast Track KYC, and it incorporates further integration of AI features. “This update builds on Pi’s expansion of wallet activation eligibility – where KYC’d individuals can now activate wallets even before completing Mainnet migration – and continues the network’s mission to increase accessibility while maintaining strong security standards,” the announcement said. PI Price Update Pi Network’s native token, which once traded close to $3 at the end of February, has lost nearly 88% of its value and now struggles at just over $0.35. This is just 8% higher than the all-time high marked at the end of August. However, the Pi community remains bullish. As reported earlier, popular analysts predicted a massive triple-digit price move that could take the PI token to a new local peak of $1.23. MOON JEFF, known for his pro-PI opinions online, said the asset could skyrocket even further to a new all-time high above $3. The post Pi Network’s Grand Upgrade Is Completed?

While traditional and mid-cap cryptos are experiencing mixed performance, MUTM is emerging as a DeFi token with a combination of systemic safety, utility-driven growth, and presale momentum that makes it a prime candidate for outsized returns. With $16.1 million raised in Phase 6 alone, the token is attracting both retail and institutional participants seeking predictable yields and early exposure to a fast-growing ecosystem. Stable borrowing and smart risk management fuel confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) differentiates itself with a stable interest rate borrowing model designed to provide predictable repayment costs for all users. Borrowers will benefit from an initial rate lock and higher starting rates, combined with automatic rebalancing to adjust to market conditions. This approach will encourage higher participation while protecting liquidity, creating a reliable environment for both lenders and borrowers. Risk management is further reinforced through overcollateralization and carefully measured loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. Liquidation thresholds will ensure that underperforming positions are promptly addressed, while Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) for stablecoins allows higher borrowing limits without compromising systemic safety. Deposit and borrow caps, along with a restricted collateralization mode, will maintain protocol stability even under volatile market conditions. These combined safeguards position MUTM as a highly attractive option for those seeking capital efficiency while mitigating risk in their crypto investment strategy. $16M raised in presale and early investor advantage Phase 6 of the MUTM presale has raised $16.10 million, with 44% of 170 million tokens sold at the current price of $0.035. More than 16,450 holders have joined the ecosystem, illustrating strong market confidence. Phase 7 will see a 15% price increase, making early participation crucial for investors who want discounted access. Phase 3 buyers who entered at $0.02 have already realized a 75% gain on paper, and Phase 6 investors will be poised to capture immediate upside once the beta platform launches and Layer-2 integration goes live. The presale provides an opportunity not only to acquire tokens at favorable pricing but also to gain early access to real platform utility. Investors entering now will experience beta testing firsthand, benefiting from fast, low-cost transactions facilitated by Layer-2 solutions. This combination of early access and operational efficiency is expected to generate strong demand and sustained upward pressure on the token price. Demand drivers supporting a 23x upside There are a number of structural things about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that are making investors interested. The beta launch coming up will let people interact with the genuine platform, which will show how useful it is and improve their confidence. Layer-2 integration will make transactions cheaper and faster, which will lead to more trading and adoption. The money made by lending and borrowing will be used to purchase back MUTMs and given to mtToken stakers. This will create a steady demand for tokens and help their value go up. Expected listing the coin on well-known exchanges will make it much more visible, liquid, and easy to get to, reaching a bigger audience. The expected launch of a stablecoin will also offer new ways to use the ecosystem, which will make MUTM more valuable as both a governance and utility token. These elements together make the token more appealing to short- and medium-term investors looking for good returns. Security and community benefits are also important parts of what makes MUTM so appealing. The platform has been checked by CertiK, which included Manual Review and Static Analysis. It got a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79. Participants in a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program will be rewarded for finding possible security flaws, and a $100,000 giveaway will encourage people to get involved and adopt the program early. These steps provide investors more trust in crypto investments since they know that systemic safety is a top priority. In short, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers stable-rate borrowing that is easy to foresee, strong risk management, beta platform expertise, Layer-2 efficiency, continual buybacks, and expanding usefulness. MUTM is the best coin to buy in 2025 for investors who want a quick 23x return because of the Phase 6 presale momentum and planned early access. For people who are actively investing in crypto and keeping an eye on how the market is changing, MUTM is a great chance to make a lot of money while being part of a well-organized and safe DeFi ecosystem.

Solana Price Prediction: Steady Gains, Not Explosive Upside For the first time, companies are treating Solana like a reserve asset — similar to how Bitcoin started showing up on balance sheets in 2020. Forward Industries has piled in with 6.82M SOL worth $1.6 billion, averaging $232 per coin. DeFi Development Corp holds over $500M in SOL, while other firms like Upexi Inc., Sharps Technology, and Sol Strategies have joined the wave. Together, institutions now control more than 17M SOL worth $4.3B. This institutional backing has given Solana price action a strong floor, keeping $215–$220 as a key support range. If bulls hold that zone, analysts see a path toward $260 and eventually $300. But here’s the catch: while those gains look solid, they’re modest compared to the life-changing multiples available in smaller, faster-growing projects. Yes, Solana could break past $250 and make a run toward $300 or even retest its all-time high near $294. But with its market cap already sitting around $100B+, the law of large numbers makes 100x growth nearly impossible from here. Solana’s upside is steady, maybe even safe — but “safe” rarely changes anyone’s life in crypto. Why Layer Brett Could Deliver the Real Multiples This is where Layer Brett enters the conversation. Nobody is watching Layer Brett because of its price tag — still just $0.0058 in presale. They’re watching because it’s a Layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum , built for speed, scale, and adoption. It processes transactions far faster than Ethereum itself while keeping gas fees dirt cheap, making it a real contender in the L2 race. The project is exploding: it’s closing in on 10,000 holders in just weeks, building a massive social presence, and its presale has already smashed past $3.8 million on track to hit $4M. On top of that, staking rewards remain eye-watering, with APYs above 670% for early adopters. Here’s the kicker: all the billions pouring into Ethereum ETFs aren’t just staying in ETH. They’re bound to spill into Ethereum’s ecosystem — especially into Layer 2s like Layer Brett. That’s why when ETH pumps, Layer Brett is primed to go parabolic. Final Word: Solana vs. Layer Brett Solana may still climb higher with ETF flows and institutional adoption, but the real asymmetric opportunity lies with Layer Brett . It’s faster than Ethereum, cheaper to use, and is building a viral community at breakneck speed. With the presale racing toward $4M, over 670% APY staking live, and prices still just $0.0058, this is the kind of setup crypto investors dream about. If Solana is the steady ship, Layer Brett is the rocket — and 2025 could be the year it launches past the stratosphere. LBRETT is available now at $0.0058. Don’t miss out on the next 100x—join the Layer Brett presale today.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a prime candidate for those seeking outsized gains, offering the kind of structured mechanics and growth potential that differentiate it from top-tier crypto coins. While BTC’s trajectory promises a doubling or tripling over the years, MUTM’s presale pricing and strategic design position it for a projected 1,100% return, attracting attention from investors exploring where to allocate capital in today’s evolving ground of crypto investment. Stable borrowing and risk management create predictable gains At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its stable interest rate borrowing system. Investors will benefit from an initial rate lock with a slightly higher starting rate to safeguard liquidity, and dynamic rebalancing conditions will adjust rates based on utilization levels. This model will protect borrowers from unexpected spikes while ensuring predictable protocol income, which is particularly appealing in a market where uncertainty dominates discussions about what is going on with crypto today. Unlike other high-volatility altcoins, MUTM will provide a clear framework for borrowing, lending, and staking, allowing participants to plan returns with greater confidence. MUTM’s secondary features further strengthen its position as a high-potential DeFi token. Every loan will be overcollateralized, with disciplined LTV limits and liquidation penalties designed to protect protocol solvency. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) for approved stablecoins will allow higher borrowing limits safely, and the reserve factor will accumulate interest to reinforce treasury reserves. Additional safeguards, such as deposit and borrow caps, along with a restricted collateral mode, will reduce systemic risk, positioning MUTM as a secure and reliable DeFi ecosystem for both retail and institutional investors. Presale momentum fuels early advantage Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale, having raised $16.1 million with 44% of 170 million tokens sold and more than 16,450 holders onboarded. The current price is $0.035, and Phase 7 will see a 15% price increase, creating urgency for investors to secure discounted tokens. Early participants are already seeing strong returns: Phase 2 buyers at $0.015 have realized 2.3x paper gains. Phase 6 investors will benefit from exposure to the upcoming beta launch, which will showcase real platform utility, positioning holders for rapid adoption and market traction. Several demand drivers are building a strong growth narrative for MUTM. The stable-rate borrowing mechanism will broaden the borrower base and ensure predictable revenue streams. Layer-2 integration will allow faster, cheaper transactions, improving user experience and adoption. The upcoming beta release and successful execution of the roadmap will provide users with hands-on exposure, further reinforcing trust in the ecosystem. Anticipated listings on leading exchanges will enhance visibility, liquidity, and adoption, drawing comparisons with other DeFi platforms and traditional crypto coins. Utility and incentive structure reinforce growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will let people stake mtTokens, which will let them receive rewards while the protocol does open-market token buybacks of MUTM. This will create long-term demand and encourage people to store their tokens for a long time. Minting stablecoins in the future will make the ecosystem more useful by introducing more features than just borrowing and lending. These capabilities, along with the protocol’s treasury-backed structure and strict risk management, are sure to draw attention from both retail and institutional investors. This sets MUTM apart from larger, less flexible crypto assets. Security is still a key part of MUTM’s plan. The platform has been checked by CertiK and scored 90 on TokenScan and 79 on Skynet, which shows that the smart contracts are quite secure. A $50,000 Bug Bounty Program will pay developers for finding bugs, and a $100,000 ongoing giveaway will keep the community involved and speed up the use of tokens. In conclusion, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a strong chance of giving you 1,100% returns since it has steady borrowing rates, rigorous risk control, treasury-backed incentives, Layer-2 efficiency, and smart presale positioning. While BTC fans argue about the million-dollar level, smart investors looking to put money into crypto will see that MUTM has the ability to go better than the best coins. Phase 7 is about to go up by 15%, and the window for early discounted access is closing. This makes MUTM a great choice for anyone who wants structured growth in a market where clarity and predictability are getting harder to find.

52044611,585809,1758437053,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52044611.jpeg,Coinbase’s Super App Vision: Why Best Wallet Token ($BEST) Could Be the Real Winner,https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-super-app-vision-why-best-wallet-token-could-surge/,"The last few months have been overarchingly bullish for the crypto market, not just from a raw price gain perspective, but also because of the fundamental changes taking place under the new pro-crypto Trump administration. This has sparked a wave of growth initiatives among crypto companies, who are now more clear-headed than ever in their ambition to create a better, well-oiled crypto infrastructure. The latest example is Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong confirming in a recent interview that the company intends to soon offer a full-fledged crypto super app, combining financial services like payments, credit cards, and rewards – but built entirely on crypto. ‘ Yes, we do want to become a super app and provide all types of financial services ,’ Armstrong said in the interview. Keep reading to find out what this could mean for the broader crypto market, how Coinbase is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about companies in the space, and how you can ride this new innovation tailwind with Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . Coinbase’s Super App Vision Gains Momentum with Pro-Crypto Shift The basis of this discussion was the bottlenecks of the current banking system and just how outdated and inefficient they are. Armstrong pointed out the high transaction fees still prevalent in the traditional market, saying it’s simply baffling that users have to pay 2-3% every time they swipe their credit card when, in reality, it’s just bits of data flowing over the internet. ‘It should be free or close to it,’ he said. Although Armstrong didn’t reveal the full set of features of super crypto app, he did mention a credit card with 4% Bitcoin rewards, citing the company’s mission to become a full-fledged bank replacement for people. As mentioned earlier, the recent pro-crypto shift by the U.S. government, including moves by the SEC, has been a major push forward for companies like Coinbase. Armstrong seconded that, specifically referencing the GENIUS Act , which offers regulatory clarity for companies such as Coinbase. He explained that this effectively removes a long-standing obstacle: the constant uncertainty over whether their services might be banned or rejected at any moment. Best Wallet and $BEST: A Super App Opportunity for Early Investors Speaking of crypto super apps, it’s worth checking out Best Wallet – a new free crypto wallet offering a unique combination of rock-solid security and class-leading ease of use. Experts believe it could be the next big breakout winner, and for good reason. While the much-talked-about Coinbase app still has a long way to go before launch, Best Wallet is already here, refining the crypto experience as we speak. Most importantly from an investor’s perspective, you can’t directly participate in Coinbase’s crypto endeavours. Sure, you can buy the company’s stock ($COIN), but won’t deliver the kind of returns a successful crypto project could. This is why Best Wallet’s native cryptocurrency, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , is arguably the best crypto to buy now if you’re looking to ride the growth of a utility-driven project. Understanding Best Wallet’s Appeal For starters, Best Wallet offers one of the most secure wallet experiences on the market. It’s a non-custodial crypto wallet , so no one but you gets access to your private keys , ensuring foolproof privacy. The app offers a slew of two-factor authentication options, including biometric login. Best Wallet also comes packed with safeguards against hacks, scams, and phishing sites. Even better, there’s an internal Best Wallet team that verifies the legitimacy of every single token before listing it on their app. Speaking of which, Best Wallet is the ONLY wallet right now that lets you buy the best crypto presales and new meme coins in presale directly within the app. The ‘traditional’ wallet experience involves visiting the external presale website, connecting your wallet, and then heading back to authorize the transaction. Meanwhile, if you’re a Best Wallet user, you can buy the best altcoins in just a few clicks, without having to exit the app’s secure environment. What’s more, you also have the liberty to create multiple Ethereum wallets, allowing you to better organize your crypto portfolio – one wallet for long-term holding, another for staking, and yet another for active trading. Buying $BEST Unlocks Serious Perks Of course, the most obvious and biggest benefit of buying Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is that it lets you ride the project’s growth. After all, Best Wallet is on its way to capture 40% of the entire non-custodial crypto wallet market by 2027. According to our $BEST price prediction , the token could hit $0.62 by the end of 2026, representing a whopping 2,300% ROI from the current token price. In plain English, this means if you invest $100 today, it could potentially turn into $2,400 in just a little over 12 months. That said, buying $BEST also unlocks an entirely new tier of platform-based benefits, including: Reduced transaction and gas fees Voting rights on key platform decisions Exclusive early access to presales and new projects before they hit the market Staking rewards, currently yielding 83% per year Best Wallet Token is in presale right now, with already over $16M raised from early investors. 1 $BEST is priced at just $0.025675, and you can check out our step-by-step guide on how to buy $BEST for any help with the purchase process.

52045043,https://invezz.com/?p=2891491,1758437086,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"3 best cryptocurrencies of this month: ETH for HODL, BTC for stability, MUTM for quick 43x ROI",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/21/3-best-cryptocurrencies-of-this-month-eth-for-hodl-btc-for-stability-mutm-for-quick-43x-roi/,"This month, crypto investors are closely watching three standout digital assets: Ethereum (ETH) for long-term holding, Bitcoin (BTC) for stability, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for aggressive, high-ROI opportunities. While ETH and BTC serve traditional roles in wealth preservation and institutional confidence, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a utility-driven DeFi token offering active engagement, predictable yields, and innovative lending mechanics that are shaping the next wave of crypto investing. Ethereum (ETH): Long-term HODL benefits Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the smart contract ecosystem, with widespread adoption in decentralized finance, NFTs, and enterprise blockchain solutions. Its staking mechanism allows investors to earn passive rewards, making ETH ideal for long-term HODL strategies. Institutional adoption and network growth ensure that Ethereum (ETH) remains a core asset for portfolios, while Layer-2 integrations across the ecosystem promise future improvements in transaction speed and efficiency. Despite these advantages, ETH’s short-term ROI is comparatively modest, positioning it as a stable, patient investment rather than a rapid-growth opportunity. Crypto predictions indicate that ETH will maintain steady gains as a foundational asset in the broader market of crypto coins, attracting both retail and institutional investors focused on preservation rather than speculation. Bitcoin (BTC): Stability and safe-haven appeal Bitcoin (BTC) remains the original digital asset and a cornerstone for crypto portfolios. Its market stability, liquidity, and global recognition provide a secure store of value, particularly during volatile periods. Investors rely on BTC as a hedge against market swings, ensuring that their portfolios maintain a stable baseline. However, Bitcoin (BTC)’s large market capitalization naturally limits rapid price acceleration. Crypto investing trends show that BTC offers security and institutional confidence, but its growth trajectory in the short term is slower compared to innovative DeFi altcoins. For those seeking stability and reliability in a diversified strategy, BTC serves as the go-to safe-haven asset, complementing higher-risk, high-reward options like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance (MUTM): High-ROI DeFi utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leading the charge in utility-driven DeFi growth. Through P2C lending, users deposit bluechip assets such as ETH, BTC, SOL, AVAX, LINK, and ADA to earn predictable returns, while P2P lending supports higher-risk tokens like PEPE, DOGE, SHIB, FLOKI, and TRUMP in isolated pools, safeguarding overall liquidity. Borrowers will benefit from stable-rate loans with higher starting rates and rebalancing mechanisms that ensure both predictable repayment and sustainable protocol revenue. Overcollateralization and Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) for stablecoins allow users to maximize borrowing limits safely, while Layer-2 integration delivers faster, cheaper transactions, boosting platform adoption. Phase 6 has raised $16.1 million, with 44% of 170 million tokens sold at $0.035 and over 16,450 holders participating. Phase 7 will see a 15% price increase, making this the final opportunity to secure discounted tokens. Early investors are already seeing significant gains: Phase 1 participants who swapped $5,000 from ETH or AVAX into MUTM at $0.01 now hold $17,500 at $0.035 on paper, with projections reaching $30,000 at $0.06. The beta launch will provide hands-on experience with real DeFi features, increasing adoption, engagement, and confidence. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also features a buy-and-distribute mechanism that repurchases tokens for mtToken stakers, driving continuous demand. The upcoming stablecoin launch will further expand utility, while expected exchange listings on Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, MEXC, and Kraken will enhance liquidity and visibility. An ongoing $100,000 giveaway rewards 10 participants with $10,000 each in MUTM tokens, amplifying community engagement. Conclusion While ETH and BTC remain essential pillars of any crypto portfolio, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers unmatched short-term upside, combining presale FOMO, Layer-2 speed, beta access, buyback-driven demand, and growing DeFi utility. Crypto investing trends indicate that early MUTM investors are positioned for potential 43x returns, making it the standout choice this month for both utility and rapid ROI, while ETH and BTC continue to serve their traditional HODL and stability roles.

In 2029, the coin could be worth between $21.48 and $25.29, with an average price of $22.08. In 2031, RPL will range between $44.88 and $53.15. Unlike traditional staking services, Rocket Pool allows users to pool their Ethereum (ETH) to run validator nodes on the Ethereum network. Thus, participants can participate in the staking process without requiring the full 32 ETH to run a validator node. Furthermore, Rocket Pool introduces the concept of “rETH” tokens, which are issued to users who stake ETH in the Rocket Pool network. These rETH tokens represent users’ stake in the pool and can be traded or transferred independently of the underlying ETH, providing liquidity and flexibility to participants. Overall, Rocket Pool aims to democratize Ethereum staking and contribute to the decentralization of the Ethereum network by providing a secure, efficient, and accessible platform for staking participation. As DeFi continues to gain traction, Rocket Pool stands out as a pioneering project at the forefront of innovation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? Can Rocket Pool’s price reach $50?

The Bollinger Bands indicate price compression, suggesting potential volatility ahead, with resistance around $6.46 and upper resistance near $6.90. The RSI at 44.71 reflects weak buying pressure, keeping RPL in a neutral-to-bearish zone. MACD remains slightly negative, pointing to limited bullish momentum. If buyers regain strength, a move toward $6.46–$6.90 is possible. However, sustained weakness could pull the price back to $6.01 support. Overall, RPL is consolidating, and traders should watch for volume spikes to confirm the next trend direction. RPL/USD 4-hour price chart analysis RPLUSD chart by TradingView Rocket Pool (RPL) on the 4-hour chart is consolidating near $6.24, with limited momentum after a recent decline. The Bollinger Bands are narrowing, showing reduced volatility, while the price hovers close to the lower band near $6.00, acting as immediate support. The MACD remains in negative territory, highlighting weak bullish conviction and a possible continuation of bearish sentiment. Balance of Power at 0.50 suggests some buying attempts, but they lack dominance. If buyers push past resistance at $6.44, a move toward $6.88 could unfold. Failure to hold above $6.00 may trigger further downside pressure in the short term.

The RSI at 44 suggests weak momentum, with sellers slightly in control. On the 4-hour chart, consolidation dominates as price hovers near the lower Bollinger Band, and the MACD remains bearish, hinting at subdued upward strength. Short-term resistance sits at $6.44, and holding above $6.00 is key to avoiding deeper losses. A breakout above resistance could shift momentum bullish, but caution prevails amid current weakness. Is Rocket Pool a good investment? Rocket Pool (RPL) presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its innovative decentralized Ethereum staking model, offering potentially high returns through staking rewards. However, investors should consider market volatility and competition within the DeFi space. Conduct thorough research and assess personal risk tolerance before investing in RPL. Will Rocket Pool reach $50? Rocket Pool (RPL) reaching $50 appears possible but is uncertain. Predictions suggest a range of $44.88 to $53.15 for 2031 if market conditions are favorable and investor sentiment improves. However, significant upward momentum is required to achieve this target soon. Will Rocket Pool reach $150? Reaching $150 for Rocket Pool (RPL) seems highly ambitious and unlikely in the near term. Our Rocket Pool forecast suggests that RPL may peak at around $74.65 by 2031. Is Rocket Pool a safe investment? Rocket Pool is generally considered a secure investment due to its decentralized structure, robust security audits, and significant total value locked (over $4.4 billion), reflecting user confidence. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries inherent risks due to market volatility and potential technical vulnerabilities Does RPL have a good long-term future? RPL’s chart shows an immediate outlook that appears bearish. However, assessing its long-term future requires considering broader market trends.

However, they also warned that the asset may tumble to multi-month lows if it loses a critical support level. New ATH Next Week? Ripple’s XRP reached a local peak of almost $3.20 earlier this month. Since then, it has retraced to $3.01 (per CoinGecko’s data), but some community members believe reaching a higher level in September remains possible. We decided to ask some of the most popular AI chatbots whether those assumptions are plausible, especially for the week that starts today and runs to next Sunday. It first outlined the range between $2.80 and $2.90 as strong support, while saying that $3.30, $3.50, and $3.60-$3.66 serve as major resistance zones. The chatbot claimed that if the bulls manage to push the price above $3.07-$3.10, XRP could climb to as high as $3.50 by the end of next week. “More likely, given current consolidation, XRP’s highest in that period will be somewhere between $3.20–$3.35, assuming resistance isn’t overwhelmed and support holds firm,” it predicted. At the same time, ChatGPT cautioned that a drop to $2.80-$2.90 could lead to a further pullback to $2.70. Grok, the AI chatbot built into the social media platform X, was more bullish. It synthesized some of the forecasts circulating on X and other platforms to estimate that XRP could fly to a new all-time high of $4.20 sometime next week. It suggested that the main catalysts for such a rally would be the potential ETF inflows combined with the Fed-fueled risk-on sentiment. Recall that earlier this week, REX-Osprey launched the first spot XRP ETF in the US. The product had an impressive debut and could trigger a price pump if the investor interest remains solid. According to Grok, the odds for a jump to $4.20 in the week ahead are 25%, while the probability of a price in the $3.50 – $4.20 range is set at 60%. The remaining 15% go to a correction below $3. How About a Spark Above $5? Perplexity set an even more optimistic target, claiming that XRP may consolidate between $3.50 and $4.20 next week and soar beyond $5. Moreover, the chatbot noted that some predictions point to a rally to $9, based on historical patterns and parabolic market behavior. However, such a pump seems unlikely as of now. After all, reaching $9 in the next several days will require XRP’s market capitalization to surpass $500 billion, and as of this writing, the figure stands just north of $180 billion. “Overall, the most likely highest price for XRP during the specific week of September 21-28, 2025, appears to be between about $3.10 (moderate outlook) and $4.20 in an optimistic scenario with potential catalysts. Prices significantly above that are seen as less probable but possible in a strong bull run,” Perplexity concluded.

In its update, XRPScan stated, “The number of accounts currently active on XRPL crossed 7 million mark today,” and included a screenshot from its distribution dashboard to highlight the milestone. The shared image displays a precise figure of 7,000,768 active accounts and outlines further details on supply and ledger metrics. Among the statistics shown, the maximum supply remains at 100,000,000,000 XRP, while the total available supply is listed at 99,985,797,573 XRP. It also shows that 14,202,427 XRP have been permanently burned , 35,308,793,467 XRP are currently held in escrow, and the circulating supply stands at 64,662,801,679 XRP.

The clarification indicates that activity, as reported in the snapshot, is not measured by transaction frequency or usage levels but by whether accounts maintain the required reserve. With the reserve set at 1 XRP, any account meeting that threshold is considered part of the active account total recorded by XRPScan.

Among thousands of tokens launching, only a handful manage to combine narrative strength, tokenomics, and community loyalty. BullZilla, Pepe, and FLOKI stand tall as the top presales with 100x potential. They represent different angles of the meme coin revolution while attracting financial students, crypto enthusiasts, blockchain developers, analysts, and die-hard meme coin fans. What makes them impossible to ignore is their ability to merge entertainment with financial engineering, offering pathways to high ROI that demand serious attention. BullZilla: The Presale Beast Forging Diamond Claws BullZilla is not just a meme coin, it is an engineered ecosystem with layered incentives. At its heart lies the HODL Furnace, a staking mechanism that flips market psychology. Instead of rewarding fast flips, it incentivizes long-term holders with a staggering 70% APY. In the chaotic world of meme coins, this structured approach transforms speculation into strategy. The HODL Furnace is designed to filter out short-term paper hands, rewarding loyal holders with compounding yields. Over time, vesting ensures that rewards grow stronger, locking in investors who believe in the long journey rather than quick exits. This blend of narrative loyalty and financial reward makes BullZilla one of the Top Presales with 100x Potential. Investors scanning the market for Top Presales with 100x Potential will recognize how its staking model builds strength over time. In fact, its unique design cements BullZilla’s place among the Top Presales with 100x Potential in today’s crowded meme economy. Current Presale Metrics: Whale Signal Detected Stage: 3 (Whale Signal Detected) Phase: 3C Current Price: $0.00007241 Presale Tally: $530k+ Raised Token Holders: 1,700+ These figures underscore that BullZilla is already achieving momentum few meme coins can claim in early stage crypto investments. Strong liquidity injection and a rising holder base suggest it is not just surviving hype cycles it is building a fortress around loyalty. How to Buy BullZilla Coins-Top Presales with 100x Potential To acquire BullZilla ($BZIL) , investors need to take a few simple steps. First, set up a Web3 wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Second, buy Ethereum (ETH) on an exchange such as Binance or Coinbase and transfer it to the wallet. Third, connect the wallet to the official BullZilla presale portal. Finally, swap ETH for $BZIL. The tokens will be secured immediately and claimable once the presale concludes. This streamlined process has already onboarded thousands of participants. Real-World Application: Staking Through the HODL Furnace Unlike many meme coin presales, BullZilla offers tangible application right out of the gate. The HODL Furnace transforms passive holders into active participants in a value-driven cycle. Investors lock tokens, earn high APY, and simultaneously strengthen the ecosystem by removing weak hands from circulation. This design ensures sustainable token velocity while granting consistent yields. ROI Potential: $8,000 Presale Scenario Consider an investor purchasing $8,000 worth of BullZilla tokens at the presale price of $0.00007241. This nets over 110 million tokens. If BullZilla follows the trajectory of prior meme sensations and even modestly reaches $0.01, that same allocation would be worth over $1.1 million. Even at half that value, the ROI dwarfs traditional markets. While no outcome is guaranteed, the structural incentives of BullZilla’s presale create an environment where exponential growth is plausible. Pepe: The Cultural Icon Evolving Beyond Memes Pepe has always been more than a token, it is a cultural artifact. Born from internet meme history, it capitalized on narrative-driven demand like no other. In 2025, Pepe continues its journey by blending meme culture with financial instruments that extend far beyond simple speculation. According to Messari reports, Pepe consistently ranks among the most actively discussed meme coins across retail and institutional channels. What differentiates Pepe in this cycle is its ability to scale community trust. Its transaction volumes remain resilient even in volatile months, highlighting an engaged holder base. Developers are now integrating DeFi elements around Pepe liquidity pools, creating new layers of utility. For financial students analyzing meme coin economics, Pepe is a living case study of how digital folklore can be monetized at scale. Pepe’s success is not without risk. Market volatility remains high, and regulatory conversations around meme coins continue globally. However, its strong narrative momentum and proven liquidity make it one of the top altcoins to watch in September 2025. For early stage crypto investments, Pepe remains a cornerstone of meme-driven opportunities. FLOKI: News and Expansions Driving Market Curiosity FLOKI has made headlines once again with its strategic expansion moves. According to recent reports from CoinDesk, FLOKI’s ecosystem is scaling faster than expected, with major announcements around partnerships and DeFi integration. The team is pushing FLOKI beyond its meme roots into a multi-utility ecosystem. The most significant development in September 2025 is FLOKI’s integration into new staking protocols. This gives holders avenues to generate yields while remaining part of an active, fast-growing community. FLOKI’s partnerships are focused on expanding real-world applications, such as merchant adoption and gaming ecosystems, which deepen its relevance. Analysts see FLOKI as a strong contender in best crypto presales 2025 because it captures both meme coin loyalty and evolving DeFi adoption. By bridging cultural identity with financial utility, FLOKI creates a hybrid ecosystem appealing to retail traders and developers alike. Its recent expansion has already influenced trading volumes, making it one of the meme coin presale opportunities that cannot be overlooked. Comparative Snapshot: BullZilla, Pepe, and FLOKI Coin Core Feature Presale/Adoption Stage ROI Potential Example BullZilla HODL Furnace (70% APY) Stage 3C, $530k Raised $8,000 → $1.1m if $0.01 Pepe Cultural Icon + DeFi Pools Strong Market Presence ROI driven by liquidity FLOKI Partnerships + Staking Expanding Ecosystem ROI tied to adoption This table illustrates that while all three coins present unique pathways, BullZilla’s structured presale and staking architecture provide the most immediate mechanism for ROI-driven investors. Conclusion: Top Presales with 100x Potential The broader implication is that meme coins are no longer chaotic side-shows. They are structured ecosystems with measurable ROI potential. Bul Zilla among the top presales with 100x potential demonstrates how engineered staking and presale design can fuel exponential returns. Pepe shows how cultural loyalty translates into financial instruments. FLOKI highlights the shift toward utility-driven adoption.

52045615,585814,1758439111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52045615.jpeg,Best Crypto Presales to Buy After U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Bill Signals Bullish Supply Crunch,https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-presales-to-buy-after-us-bitcoin-reserve-bill-supply-crunch/,"Earlier this year, Donald Trump announced the formation of a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve, where the government would build its own stash of the token. Now, a new bill, called H.R. 1566 , has been passed which sets a 90-day deadline for the Treasury Department to come up with a plan to create and manage this fund. The Treasury will need to submit a practicability report and a technical plan for custody and cybersecurity. It will also have to work out how this reserve will be represented on the federal balance sheet, the role of the Forfeiture Fund, and a list of potential third-party custodians. Even a modest U.S. Bitcoin Reserve could trigger a supply shock, pushing $BTC to new highs in the next few years. Read on as we explain the impacts of the reserve on Bitcoin’s demand-supply dynamics – and point you toward the best crypto presales that could benefit. The Supply Shock Math Explained The U.S. Marshals Service already controls around 29,000 BTC that are ‘fully forfeited.’ In addition, there are about 198,000 $BTC across all U.S. agencies pending forfeiture. Bitcoin miners currently generate about 450 $BTC a day, which comes to 40,500 $BTC over a 90-day period. If the Treasury consolidates and locks the already forfeited 29,000 $BTC (Option 1), it would absorb 71% of the 90-day miner supply. But that isn’t the only scenario under discussion. If instead 100,000 $BTC is locked (Option 2), it would create a stronger supply crunch with deeper absorption and tighter flow. Add to this ETF inflows, which average around 20,000 $BTC over a 90-day period. Even conservatively, if the Treasury pursues Option 1, total demand would reach 59,000 $BTC over 90 days to satisfy both reserve and ETF requirements. That would significantly reduce the free float available for HODLing and trading, tightening the market. Still, this is just one way of looking at the situation. Simply transferring forfeited Bitcoin into a single wallet is only part of the story. The Treasury might also adopt a regular purchasing schedule – daily, weekly, or monthly – similar to how gold reserves are managed. Such ongoing buying would steadily soak up free float and increase supply pressure. The result: tokens absorbed faster than they can be mined, creating scarcity and ultimately a ‘supply shock.’ As basic economics teaches, when demand exceeds supply, prices rise, especially when supply cannot adjust to meet demand. And Bitcoin is unique: unlike commodities such as oil or copper, it has a fixed lifetime cap of 21M tokens. That means no new supply can emerge, making any demand shock far more enduring. The Global Ripple Effect So far, we’ve only considered the U.S. Bitcoin Reserve. But other countries are also exploring their own $BTC reserves, including Poland, Brazil, El Salvador, and Bhutan. A decisive U.S. move could trigger a ripple effect, spurring more governments to adopt reserve frameworks and worsening the supply squeeze. The ultimate winner is Bitcoin itself. As the supply dwindles, scarcity will deepen, and the price will rise. That’s why this may be one of the best times to buy Bitcoin. However, with $BTC already trading around $115K , there are slim chances of it churning out another 1000x rally. Smarter investors, therefore, are turning to presale cryptos that could benefit from Bitcoin’s scarcity and price momentum. If you want to make the most of this shift, here are some of the best cryptos to buy right now . 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bring Solana-Like Performance to the Bitcoin Blockchain ‘2025 will be remembered as the year Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) changed everything,’ is what’s written in bold on this new cryptocurrency project ‘s website – and for good reason. $HYPER is a never-before-seen Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin. Think of it as an express lane alongside Bitcoin’s sluggish roads. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is not even in the top 25 fastest blockchains. It can only process 7 transactions per second (TPS), whereas Solana boasts a theoretical speed of 65 TPS. But thanks to $HYPER’s Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, Bitcoin users will now be able to send, swap, and receive crypto at lightning-fast speeds, too. More notably, the SVM lets developers build smart contracts and dApps on Bitcoin, finally unlocking a full-fledged Web3 environment on the network. This includes DeFi trading, NFTs, DAOs and governance, lending, staking, swapping, blockchain gaming, and more. Furthermore, a decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge lets you interact with Bitcoin Hyper’s Web3. Simply put, it converts your Layer 1 Bitcoin into Layer 2-compatible tokens. Currently in presale, Bitcoin Hyper has already pulled in over $17.3M from early investors, including a chunky $418K from crypto whales in just the last 20 days . You can buy $HYPER for just $0.012955 apiece, and according to our $HYPER price prediction , a $100 investment today could turn into $2,400 by the end of 2025. Visit Bitcoin Hyper’s official website to learn everything about how it’s bolstering Bitcoin’s real-world utility. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – New Dog-Themed Meme Coin for 1000x Returns If you feel you’ve missed out on the explosive early-stage rallies of animal-themed meme coins that are now blue-chip cryptos – like $DOGE, $BONK, and $SHIB – it’s worth checking out Maxi Doge ($MAXI) . It’s a low-cap coin currently in presale, meaning it’s not just under the radar but also available at a huge discount. And its bottom line? Avenging Dogecoin for his ruined childhood. Maxi, by the way, is Doge’s distant cousin – and his success and aura became the reason Maxi’s family didn’t pay him much attention. But like a classic Hollywood superhero (or supervillain), Maxi didn’t give up. He hit the gym, bulked up, and studied the crypto market until he forged a rock-solid plan to take down Dogecoin. $MAXI’s goal is to become a top trending crypto . To do so, the developers have reserved a massive 40% of the total token supply for marketing efforts. This includes PR campaigns, influencer collaborations, social media blitzes, and even holder-only events like weekly trading competitions and leaderboard prizes. In addition to CEX and DEX listings, $MAXI is also eyeing futures platforms. This would give meme coin traders the ultimate opportunity to churn out whale-like returns, plus it’ll make $MAXI the heartthrob of the market. With over $2.4M already raised, Maxi Doge’s presale is off to a slick start. Each token is priced at just $0.0002585, and if you need any help grabbing it, check out our guide on how to buy $MAXI . Also, according to our Maxi Doge price prediction , the token could hit $0.0024 by year-end – a massive 820% ROI. Visit Maxi Doge’s official website to learn more about its fiery mission, roadmap, and tokenomics. 3. Remittix ($RTX) – Game-Changing Project Revolutionizing the Cross-Border Payments Market Despite crypto’s fast-growing legitimacy, the fact remains that tier-2 and tier-3 countries have yet to fully embrace the decentralized nature of crypto payments. This is why Remittix ($RTX) could be the next crypto to explode . It lets you send crypto directly to traditional bank accounts, which then receive it in fiat. The recipients won’t even realize the transaction originated in crypto. By offering a unique crypto-to-fiat bridge, Remittix aims to solve a critical bottleneck in traditional banking infrastructure and capture a substantial share of the global cross-border payments market, projected to reach $250T by 2027 . At the time of writing, $RTX supports over 30 fiat currencies and 50+ cryptocurrency pairs, plus it also offers lightning-fast transactions and zero FX fees. The Remittix presale has already raised a staggering $26.2M in early funding, with each token still priced at just $0.1080. This is arguably the lowest price you’ll ever be able to get $RTX for. Recap : With the U.S. Bitcoin reserve set to absorb coins faster than miners can produce them and cause a bullish supply shock, there couldn’t be a better time to buy under-the-radar, high-upside presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , and Remittix ($RTX). Disclaimer: None of the above is financial advice. The crypto market is highly volatile and risky, so kindly do your own research before investing.

In 2028, the coin could be worth between $14.63 and $17.70, with an average price of $15.05. By 2031, Cosmos (ATOM) might touch $53.15. Cosmos (ATOM) is a blockchain ecosystem that facilitates interoperability among independent blockchains. Co-founded by Jae Kwon and Ethan Buchman in 2014, Cosmos aims to create a decentralized network of blockchains that can communicate and transact seamlessly. Its main components include the Cosmos Hub, which serves as the central chain, and multiple “zones” that operate under their own rules while connecting to the Hub. The platform uses the Tendermint consensus algorithm and Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable fast, low-cost transactions. Fees average around $0.01, and confirmation times are approximately seven seconds. Cosmos employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, allowing users to stake their ATOM tokens for network security and transaction validation. Since its ICO in 2017, Cosmos has raised significant funding and established a growing ecosystem, including notable projects like Terra and Binance. With over 286 million ATOM tokens in circulation and a market cap exceeding $7.7 billion, Cosmos is positioned as a key player in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology, often referred to as the “Internet of Blockchains” for its ambitious goal of connecting diverse blockchain networks.

The RSI at 51.74signals neutral momentum, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. Bollinger Bands indicate price consolidation, with the middle band at $4.56 acting as resistance and the lower band near $4.32 offering support. The recent green candle suggests buying interest is re-emerging, though selling pressure remains evident after sharp red candles earlier. If bulls can push above $4.56, ATOM could target the upper band around $4.79. Conversely, failure to hold $4.32 support risks a slide toward $4.20. Overall, sentiment remains cautious. ATOM/USD 4-hour price chart ATOMUSD chart by TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart, ATOM is trading near $4.50, showing early signs of recovery after recent declines. The MACD remains in bearish territory, though the histogram indicates weakening selling pressure, suggesting momentum may shift. Bollinger Bands are moderately wide, with price rebounding from the lower band around $4.38, signaling potential short-term support. The Balance of Power at 0.53 highlights improving buyer strength, while consistent green candles hint at growing bullish sentiment. If ATOM sustains above $4.50, it may test the middle band near $4.54. However, rejection at this level could push it back toward $4.38 support.

Based on the 1-day and 4-hour charts, ATOM shows mixed signals. On the daily timeframe, price trades around $4.51, consolidating after recent volatility, with RSI near 51, reflecting neutral momentum. Support rests at $4.32, while resistance is near $4.79, keeping ATOM within a defined range. On the 4-hour chart, the coin is rebounding from the lower Bollinger Band at $4.38, with the Balance of Power turning positive at 0.53, suggesting buyers are regaining control. Short-term momentum could push ATOM toward $4.54–$4.60, but failure to maintain strength risks a retracement back to the $4.38 support zone. Is Cosmos a good investment? Cosmos (ATOM) shows potential as an investment due to its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and recent upgrades like ATOM 2.0. Analysts predict long-term price growth, but the crypto market is highly volatile. Investors should conduct their research and consider risks before investing in ATOM. Is Cosmos a safe Network? The Cosmos network is built on the Tendermint consensus protocol, offering robust security and interoperability features. However, like all blockchain systems, it faces potential risks, requiring users to remain cautious and well-informed about emerging vulnerabilities and challenges. Will Cosmos reach $50? Based on Cosmos’ current market trends and growth projections, Cosmos (ATOM) is expected to reach a value of approximately $37.30 by 2030. Will Cosmos reach $100? Current predictions suggest that Cosmos (ATOM) will likely reach $100 in 2033. Analysts estimate it would require a significant increase of over 900% to hit that price. Does Cosmos have a good long-term future? Cosmos (ATOM) promises a strong long-term future, with forecasts indicating significant price increases over the next decade. Analysts predict that ATOM could reach values as high as $37.30 by 2030, driven by its unique position in the blockchain ecosystem and ongoing developments in interoperability and scalability. The Cosmos Hub is well-established and supported by a dedicated community, enhancing its growth and adoption prospects in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

Cosmos historic price sentiment Cosmos price history Cosmos, created by Ethan Buchman and Jae Kwon, launched its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2017, with the network officially going live two years later in 2019. During the bullish market cycle of 2021, Cosmos peaked at $44, driven by significant investor interest and market optimism. However, following this surge, on 3rd April 2022, the price of Cosmos (ATOM) sharply declined to $6.39. Since then, Cosmos entered a prolonged phase of consolidation, trading within a range between $6.39 and $16 as market dynamics fluctuated. In early 2024, particularly around 8th March, Cosmos encountered significant resistance at the $13 level, struggling to gain momentum above this point. This resistance reflected broader market sentiment and potential selling pressure. By July 2024, ATOM’s price was trading in a narrower range, between $5 and $6, indicating a lack of upward momentum. By August 2024, the price had further dipped to $4.02, suggesting increasing bearish pressure. This recent decline highlights ongoing challenges for Cosmos in maintaining its price stability and suggests potential further downside as market bears dominate, putting pressure on potential buyers to defend against a continued downward trend. In September 2024, the Cosmos price ranged between $4 and $5, and on October 06, the price traded at $4.5837 with a trading volume of $48.48M. On November 5, ATOM was trading at $4.10. By December 5, ATOM’s price surged significantly, trading at $10. Cosmos ATOM surged to $9 at the start of December 2024, but it declined to $9.6 and closed the year at $6.3. In January 2025, Cosmos peaked at $7.77, and in February, it traded between $4.54 and $4.86. ATOM value decreased further in March, trading between the $4.0 and $4.2 range. Cosmos ATOM traded between $4.0 and $4.2 in March. ATOM ended April at $4.5. In May, ATOM is trading around $4.67 – $5. ATOM ended May at $4.61. In June, ATOM is trading between $2.9 and $4.3. As of the beginning of July, the ATOM price is currently trading between $4.07 and $4.44. From July 31, 2025 – August 1, 2025: ATOM fell from approximately $4.21 to $4.15, reflecting a modest decline of about –1.6% The token dipped further to around $4.09 on August 2, then recovered to $4.10 on August 3, and closed near $4.27 on August 4—a rebound nearing +4.4% from the early August low In early August, Cosmos traded around $4.14, rising steadily to reach $4.79 to $4.89 by mid-month, showing a solid bullish run. Entering late August, the price dipped to around $4.42 to $4.48, then held in the $4.42 to $4.50 range through August 31. In the first days of September, ATOM fluctuated between $4.38 and $4.52, closing around $4.42 to $4.44 by September 5.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ATOM|TRADING|ICO|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-21 07:20:00

According to Lummis, if the United States held 1 million Bitcoins (BTC) as a strategic reserve for 20 years, it could eliminate half of the $37 trillion national debt. Lummis stated that the process could be accelerated, saying the first step could be taken with seized digital assets held by the US Marshals Service. He argued that these assets could be the starting point for a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” adding that over time, other assets could be converted into Bitcoin and accumulated in the reserve. Related News: Two Whales Dumped This Altcoin: Sold in Bulk According to the senator, some of these steps could be implemented within existing presidential powers without requiring new legislation. However, Lummis said that a legal framework must be established for long-term security: “Legislating a strategic Bitcoin reserve is crucial because it cannot be easily eliminated by the policies of future presidents.” Lummis stated that the goal is to collect 1 million Bitcoins, or about 5% of the total supply, and hold them for 20 years. According to Lummis, if this vision is realized, it could erase half of the US national debt. *This is not investment advice.

To put that in perspective, most ETFs barely clear $1 million at launch. Alongside Dogecoin’s ETF, institutional demand for crypto assets is no longer a question — it’s here. Still, while XRP is capturing headlines, the real excitement is building around Layer Brett ($LBRETT), a Ethereum-adjacent Layer 2 scalability solution growing so quickly that analysts believe it could outpace even Ethereum’s most successful scaling solutions. XRP Price Prediction: Rangebound for Now Currently trading near $3, XRP has drawn a battle line. Support sits around $2.90, while resistance looms at $3.20. Break above that ceiling, and a run to $3.66 or even higher is possible. Break below support, and the token risks sliding toward $2.60. Institutional inflows from the ETF launch give XRP a solid foundation, but this is still a slow grind. Long-term forecasts of $5 to $15 by 2030 make XRP a stable, respectable hold — but for retail investors chasing asymmetric returns, it’s hardly revolutionary. XRP Price Prediction: What $1,000 in XRP Might Look Like by 2030 If XRP climbs to $5, $1,000 today would be worth around $1,650. If it reaches $15, it could grow to $5,000. These are strong gains, but in a market where meme-born coins have delivered 100x or more, XRP’s trajectory feels restrained. Layer Brett: The Dark Horse of Ethereum’s Ecosystem Now, here’s where things get interesting. Layer Brett ($LBRETT) isn’t being watched because of its presale price. It’s being watched because it’s rewriting the playbook on what a Layer 2 scalability solution can achieve. Faster than Ethereum, cheaper than Ethereum, and surging toward 10,000 holders in only weeks, Layer Brett is growing with a velocity usually reserved for Silicon Valley unicorns. The presale has already broken $3.8 million and is charging toward $4 million, while staking rewards north of 670% APY are drawing in early adopters. More importantly, Layer Brett isn’t just a token — it’s a rapidly expanding ecosystem with a social presence that’s scaling as fast as its tech. And here’s the part Wall Street won’t ignore: the billions pouring into Ethereum ETFs aren’t going to sit still. History shows that institutional inflows always cascade into Ethereum’s Layer 2 ecosystem. That positions Layer Brett to ride ETH’s coattails, but at a speed and scale XRP can’t match. Analysts argue it could rally faster than meme coins like PEPE — with the critical difference being that Layer Brett marries meme appeal with real blockchain utility. Final Word: $LBRETT to outpace XRP in potential gains from 2025-2030 XRP is proving it belongs on Wall Street. But for investors hunting for life-changing multiples, it’s Layer Brett that looks set to write the next chapter of crypto growth. At $0.0058 today, with lightning-fast transactions, ultra-low fees, and momentum building on every front, it isn’t just another token — it’s shaping up to be the best asymmetric bet of 2025. LBRETT is available now at $0.0058. Don’t miss out on the next 100x—join the Layer Brett presale today.

In a post, SMQKE wrote, “XRP + ISO 20022 DATA STANDARDS COULD DRASTICALLY REDUCE FRICTION IN CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS.” The researcher’s comment reflects an ongoing narrative that positions XRP and the ISO 20022 standard as complementary elements in addressing inefficiencies in international financial transactions. XRP + ISO 20022 DATA STANDARDS COULD DRASTICALLY REDUCE FRICTION IN CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS Documented. https://t.co/Gf4Ws8M3OH pic.twitter.com/AVpGshD5MG — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 19, 2025 Understanding ISO 20022 ISO 20022 is an international financial messaging standard that establishes a common framework for payment data. It allows for structured, detailed, and machine-readable information to be transmitted with each payment message. This eliminates many of the limitations of legacy systems, where data fields were constrained and often led to incomplete or truncated information. By offering richer detail, ISO 20022 enables greater automation, improved reconciliation, and more efficient compliance screening. It has been adopted by major central banks , clearinghouses, and global payment networks as part of a phased migration process, to establish one uniform standard across the industry. The benefits of ISO 20022 are frequently described in terms of reducing friction. More structured data means fewer delays caused by manual interventions, improved interoperability across institutions, and enhanced capacity to meet regulatory requirements. In the context of cross-border transactions, this standard addresses one of the most persistent pain points: inconsistent and insufficient data that disrupts payment processing and increases cost. XRP’s Role in Settlement XRP is widely discussed for its ability to provide near-instant settlement with low transaction costs. The XRP Ledger processes transactions in a matter of seconds and imposes minimal fees, often measured in fractions of a cent. Supporters argue that these characteristics make it well suited for cross-border use cases where cost and speed are critical factors. When combined with ISO 20022, the claim is that institutions could achieve both fast settlement and clean, detailed payment messaging. The logic is that XRP reduces the settlement layer friction while ISO 20022 ensures that the information carried alongside payments is precise and consistent. This is the scenario highlighted by SMQKE. They describe a framework where XRP’s efficiency and ISO 20022’s structured data work together to address the long-standing challenges of cross-border payments. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Adoption and Implementation Considerations While the combination appears compelling, its practical application depends on adoption across the financial system. ISO 20022 is being rolled out gradually by major banks and financial market infrastructures, but the migration is complex and requires significant technical adjustments. Similarly, for XRP to be integrated effectively, institutions must align settlement processes with messaging frameworks and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

Solana (SOL) is also building momentum, with analysts predicting a similar run to $1,000. But as these two seasoned players continue going up, the most potential in 2025 could lie with a newcomer in the form of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . For the price of just $0.035 in presale, MUTM is anticipating a 50x return thanks to its lending and borrowing DeFi protocol, and it’s the most explosive-growth altcoin among this group. Binance Coin Price & Forecast Binance Coin (BNB) currently exchanges for $985.43, its 24-hour high and low being $980.38 and $1,005.29, up about 9% in the last week. Its rally highlights the huge demand within the Binance ecosystem, like the use of transaction fees, token burning, and usage in Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain. Resistance seems to be around the $1,000 level, while key support is forming around the $900-$950 level. Compared to BNB’s established structure and market positioning, investors are looking at Mutuum Finance, for what they perceive as potential improved percentage gain in the next bull cycle. Solana Price Remains Steady Solana (SOL) is trading at $247.60, where it stands close to the $250 level and continues to consolidate after recent activity. The network retains steadfastness in sustaining elevated transactional volume and decentralized application activity, further securing its position within the broader market. Current price action suggests a consolidation phase, with interest in seeing if SOL is able to sustain this steadiness before breaking towards greater levels. As Solana maintains its established position, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being monitored for possibly greater upside, given its early-stage position in the market. Mutuum Finance Presale Increase Mutuum Finance has achieved a record-breaking presale rate of adoption and has over 16,450 investors buying coins to raise over $16.05 million raised so far. Tokens can be bought at $0.035 per token during Phase 6. Its tiered system is an incentive system and early birds will benefit most. Mutuum Finance’s aim is to revolutionize DeFi. The project has a token giveaway for early adopters by providing $100,000 MUTM where 10 lucky people will receive a reward of $10,000 MUTM. Building a Trustworthy and Secure Ecosystem In addition to the apparent creation of an ecosystem, Mutuum Finance will introduce a USD stablecoin onto the Ethereum blockchain. In contrast to algorithmic stablecoins which have depegged during times of financial stress, the stablecoin introduced by Mutuum will be considered non-algorithmic and overcollateralized and as such can uphold its peg during times of financial stress. The model capitalizes on the idle collateral reserve stability to be long-term stable with a value preservation guarantee. This positions the stablecoin as a safe store of value, and a safe depository. The top 2025 altcoin punt is in the direction of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with minimum 50x ROI for the early adopters. Outshining the Giants Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up as the altcoin with biggest upside potential among BNB and SOL. Whereas Binance Coin (BNB) just broke above $1,000 with potential to go higher, and Solana (SOL) is trading at the $250 level on its path towards its own $1,000 goal, MUTM has much better percentage gains. At a paltry $0.035 during Stage 6 presale, with more than $16.05M invested and 16,450+ investors signed up, professionals predict 50x gains for early buyers. Lock your tokens in now at Stage 6 before the next price increase and setup for maximum potential.

With billions of tokens already sold and interest growing across the best crypto project growing ahead of Q4 2025, Pepeto is quickly becoming one of the talked-about meme projects of 2025, thanks to its utility. In traditional markets, IPOs (Initial Public Offerings) give early access to company shares before they become publicly tradable. In the crypto world, ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) and token presales serve a similar purpose, offering coins at early discounted rates. As per the team, projects like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe have shown that early entry often leads to opportunities for big profits. Getting in before the crowd and holding as demand increases can be the key move presales often make the difference between chasing trends and being in front of them. Presale Growth Shows Market Demand In the middle of the federal reserve cut of interest rate, for the first time this year, the crypto industry, where countless tokens appear, Pepeto has drawn attention for its underlying infrastructure. The project’s presale is listed at $0.000000154, with early participation reflecting growing awareness. During the presale stages, the price of Pepeto increases gradually. Each new stage brings a slightly higher cost per token, making earlier entries more cost-efficient. This structure is designed to establish progression ahead of any public listing. In addition, staking rewards are currently advertised at 226% APY, offered as part of the project’s holding mechanism. The Role of the Demo Exchange in Q4, 2025 Some crypto projects focus on giveaways or flashy promotions, but Pepeto took a different route. The demo exchange wasn’t just posted for attention, it showed what’s actually being built. The platform has since drawn interest from users, token developers, and investment groups, noting the focus on a meme-oriented exchange. Pepeto has surpassed the $6.78 million mark in its presale, indicating notable attention within the cryptocurrency community. Discussions have appeared across platforms such as Telegram, YouTube, and Twitter, as well as during live AMAs. The working demo provides an early view of planned developments for the platform. Community Interest And Pre-sale Structure Pepeto has attracted growing community engagement following the launch of its demo exchange, where users have shared screenshots, feedback, and walk-throughs. The activity has emerged organically rather than through advertising or paid promotion. Compared with earlier meme coins such as Pepe or Shiba, Pepeto has entered the market with a functioning platform and stated long-term objectives. As the presale advances, Pepeto’s price increases gradually through each phase, with later stages reflecting higher token costs. Staking is currently advertised at 226% APY, presented as an incentive for participants who hold tokens. The model is structured to address both early participation and longer-term engagement. Built on Ethereum, Designed for Scale Pepeto’s core strength is how it’s built. Using Ethereum and fully EVM-ready, it runs with fast, no-fee swaps, cross-chain tools, and supports token launches with strong safety in mind. The roadmap includes staking rewards, a meme coin launch area, and NFT functions, all designed in one place. Where most meme coins deal with high fees or weak tools, Pepeto is building things that work. Its structure solves real problems while offering features users actually need. What matters in meme coin in 2025: Security, Transparency, and Real Tech Pepeto isn’t cutting corners. The project runs with a fully doxxed team and public roadmap. Every update is shared openly through all Pepeto socials. And unlike other tokens with questionable wallets or sudden policy changes, Pepeto is building trust day by day, successfully audited by SolidProof and Coinsult . New Announcement: Tier 1 Listing and More In Progress The team behind Pepeto has signaled major next steps.

With gains for the month currently hovering around 8%, analysts are watching to see if this pattern, dubbed “Uptober”, will repeat itself. Look Out for the Double-digit October Analysts are watching BTC closely this month, noting that in past years, every September with an upward trend has been followed by double-digit gains in October. For example, in 2024, the asset recorded a +7.29% increase in September, which was followed by a +10.76% rise the next month. In 2023, it gained +3.91% during the same period and was followed by a +28.52% jump in October, as shown below: BTCUSD monthly returns. Source: CoinGlass This consistent trend has led experts to believe that traders and investors could be positioning their portfolios to anticipate a rally, which may result in a self-fulfilling prophecy. As institutional and retail money pours in, the heightened buying pressure creates the very surge they were predicting, amplifying the “Uptober” narrative and making it a key part of the market’s psychology. The April 2024 Bitcoin halving, which slashed the reward for mining new blocks by 50%, has created a supply shock. Historically, the year following a halving has been a powerful growth period. The “Uptober” rally fits into this broader cycle, as the reduced supply meets sustained demand. Past data provide evidence of this trend. For instance, the 2016 halving was followed by a landmark bull run in 2017, where BTC’s price surged from a few hundred dollars to nearly $20,000. Similarly, the 2020 halving was the precursor to a historic surge in 2021, when the cryptocurrency’s price skyrocketed from around $10,000 to a peak near $69,000 by November. Macroeconomic Policy and Institutional Adoption Following months of economic uncertainty, recent actions by central banks, including a rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September 2025, have injected a sense of confidence into riskier assets. The recent reduction by 25 BPS saw the flagship cryptocurrency’s price rally to $118 K. Additionally, recent shifts in U.S. government policy are seen as a bullish sign. The Trump administration has taken a pro-crypto stance, with the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in March 2025. The continued growth of spot Bitcoin ETFs, particularly in the United States, has also become a major driver of demand. Recent data highlights this trend. In the first half of September, these investment products saw their largest weekly inflows since July, with some funds accumulating hundreds of millions of dollars in a single day. Institutional demand is said to be outpacing the pace of new BTC supply coming from mining. The combined holdings of US-listed ETFs have now crossed 1.3 million BTC, showing the adoption by large investors and its impact on market dynamics.

The ETH price sits near $4,460 today, holding within a tight range. Traders and analysts see this pause as a setup for a bigger move, especially with ETFs pulling in billions and exchange supply falling to multi-year lows. This Ethereum price prediction looks at the road to $5,000 and beyond, while also checking why PEPE could multiply and why Layer Brett could deliver massive returns. Keep reading to see why many call $LBRETT the best buy of 2025. Ethereum price prediction looks toward $5,000 breakout ETH has held above key support levels since April. The daily chart shows the coin trading inside a large rising channel. If bulls defend the $4,300 zone and break above $4,800, experts believe ETH could rally past the $5,000 mark. Analysts at TradingView point to a possible “cup and handle” pattern that could stretch the ETH price to $5,300. Funding rates remain positive but not overheated. This signals traders are leaning bullish without extreme risk. Corporate treasuries have also been buying ETH, with $4 billion added in the past month. Combined with ETF inflows, this supports the case for higher prices. Institutions are no longer sitting on the sidelines; they are taking Ethereum as a reserve asset. On-chain data shows active addresses rising and fees up 35% in a week. All these signs strengthen the bullish view for Ethereum price prediction as the year moves closer to the Fusaka upgrade in December. ETH supply crunch ahead with PEPE eyeing 5x gains The story around ETH is not just technical charts. Exchange balances have dropped to a five-year low, with 2.69 million ETH pulled in just two months. This shrinking supply meets heavy demand from ETFs, pushing the ETH price outlook higher. While ETH holds steady, meme tokens like PEPE are showing fast moves. Whale wallets scooped billions of PEPE in recent weeks, cutting available supply on exchanges. Analysts suggest the token could push for a 5x move if momentum holds. Ethereum’s own ecosystem benefits from this activity since meme coins drive usage of the network. With ETH supply under pressure and altcoins fueling activity, experts say the setup is perfect for a significant run into 2025. Why experts believe Layer Brett could gain 65x Among new projects, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) stands out. It is a Layer 2 meme coin built on Ethereum, offering faster and cheaper transactions. Unlike older meme coins with no use, $LBRETT mixes meme energy with real blockchain functions like staking and rewards. Right now, $LBRETT is priced at only $0.0058 in presale. Early buyers also get staking rewards above 670% APY. This rare combination of low entry price and high yield is drawing thousands of investors. The project has already raised over $3.8 million in presale funds, showing strong community backing. Crypto researchers note that Ethereum Layer 2 networks are expected to process trillions of dollars in the coming years. If $LBRETT grows into this market, the returns could be life-changing. Experts project as much as 65x gains, making it one of the boldest bets of 2025. Why Layer Brett is the best crypto to buy in 2025 Ethereum is poised to hit $5,000 soon. While PEPE could post substantial gains, Layer Brett offers a unique alternative. It brings meme culture into Ethereum Layer 2 with speed, low fees, and community power. Analysts compare its roadmap to top networks like Arbitrum but highlight the added meme appeal that fuels adoption. Layer Brett is still in presale stages—but not for long. Don’t miss the opportunity to get in early on the most scalable meme project to ever launch on Ethereum.

In a blog post released on Saturday, Buterin said that it could be like the relationship between Google Search and Google. According to the Ethereum co-founder, the low-risk DeFi protocols could also do so much more, noting that they could allow nonfinancial apps to uphold Ethereum’s cultural values. “Low-risk DeFi could address ‘important tensions’ in the Ethereum community over whether apps that bring in enough revenue to economically sustain the ecosystem align with the cultural and ethical values that brought people to Ethereum in the first place”, Buterin said in the blog post. Vitalik Buterin wants low-risk DeFi to contribute to Ethereum The former has been a combination of non-fungible tokens, memecoins, and speculative trading. Meanwhile, Buterin mentioned that the semi-financial and non-financial apps that have reflected Ethereum’s cultural value are either struggling to gain widespread adoption or have not generated enough fees. “This disjointness created a lot of dissonance in the community,” Buterin said. One example Buterin made was the deposit rates for stablecoins lending on DeFi protocol Aave, which is presently around 5% for blue-chip tokens like Tether and USDC, and above 10% for tokens with higher risks. In the same way, he mentioned that Google does so many interesting and valuable things, noting its Chromium family of browsers, Pixel phones, open-source AI Gemini models, and some others, but the revenue they make from those products is little compared to what they make from search and advertisements. Buterin’s statement comes as the total value locked on Ethereum DeFi recently crossed above $100 billion for the first time since 2022. Defi TVL dropped drastically across the ecosystem during the 2022-2023 bear market, with TVL figures now trailing the performance of top layer 1 tokens in this bull market. However, there has been chatter in the DeFi industry, thanks to an increase in regulatory momentum, especially the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which has been predicted to push the adoption of the DeFi industry. Ethereum can do much better than Google, Vitalik says A recent survey from the DeFi Education Fund discovered that over 40% of Americans are open to DeFi if stronger laws are put in place. The survey, which was conducted by Ipsos, found “emerging awareness of cryptocurrency and decentralized finance as many Americans express frustrations with current financial institutions’ ability to deliver security, personalized control and flexibility,” according to Ipsos Public Affairs vice president Alec Tyson. Meanwhile, Buterin noted that Ethereum has the potential to do much better than Google due to its decentralization. He claims that, unlike Google, the decentralized structure that Ethereum boasts positions low-risk DeFi to align success with ethical outcomes, creating a relationship between doing well and being good. “The revenue generator does not have to be the most revolutionary or exciting application of Ethereum. But it does need to be something that is at least not actively unethical or not embarrassing,” he added. Buterin also spared a little criticism for Google, noting that its incentive model through advertising pushes the company to hoard user data, conflicting with its original open-source and positive ethos. He mentioned that while low-risk DeFi is often about enabling easier access to the United States dollar, particularly those in low-income and high-inflation countries, he would love to see innovations that provide economic support for Ethereum. Finally, Buterin floated the idea of building assets that track different currencies and flatcoins that are based on consumer price indices.

Both tokens are expected to reach new highs in 2025, supported by strong communities and continued visibility in the market. But while their growth may be steady, a new Ethereum Layer 2 project called Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is being tipped by analysts as a coin with the potential to deliver 100–200x returns, multiples that larger meme coins can no longer match. Dogecoin’s steady climb Dogecoin remains the original meme token and continues to command attention from retail investors and mainstream media. Over a decade since its launch, it still benefits from one of the most loyal communities in crypto. DOGE is currently trading around $0.27, and many analysts believe it could push back toward $0.50 in 2025 if the broader market trend holds. That said, Dogecoin’s large market cap makes it harder to achieve the kind of explosive growth it once delivered. While it remains a strong candidate for moderate gains, its upside potential is far more limited compared to early-stage meme coins now entering the market. Shiba Inu pushes forward with Shibarium Shiba Inu rose to prominence as the self-proclaimed “Dogecoin killer” and has since built an extensive ecosystem around its token. The launch of Shibarium, its own Layer 2 network, has given SHIB a role beyond memes by introducing scaling features, DeFi activity, and even metaverse-related projects. This has helped keep it relevant among the largest meme coins in circulation. The Shiba Inu Price could see fresh momentum if Shibarium adoption expands and more applications are built on top of it. However, like Dogecoin, its size makes another 100x breakout highly unlikely. For that reason, many traders are looking at newer meme tokens with smaller valuations and bigger upside potential. Why Layer Brett is standing out Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is quickly becoming one of the standout presale tokens of 2025. Built on Ethereum Layer 2, it’s designed to handle transactions faster and at a fraction of the usual cost, all while benefiting from Ethereum’s security. By blending meme culture with practical blockchain features, Layer Brett is carving out a niche that sets it apart from the wave of meme coins that depend only on hype. The presale has already raised more than $3.8 million, with tokens available at just $0.0058. Early buyers can stake through the project’s dApp, with current rewards sitting around 670% APY. These rates will decline as more holders participate, rewarding early adopters who act quickly. To keep engagement high, the roadmap includes NFT integrations, gamified reward features, and a $1 million community giveaway. With a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens and transparent tokenomics, Layer Brett is positioning itself as a meme coin that blends culture with blockchain fundamentals, a combination many believe could fuel a 100–200x rally in the next cycle. Conclusion Dogecoin and Shiba Inu may both reach new peaks in 2025, but their size means the upside is capped compared to emerging projects. For investors seeking exponential gains, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is being highlighted as one of the most promising opportunities, offering a rare mix of early entry pricing, strong staking rewards, and Layer 2 scalability.

Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, once considered mere internet jokes, have established themselves as formidable assets in the crypto space. However, as these established meme coins continue to grow, their potential for massive returns diminishes due to their already large market caps. Overview of Established Meme Coins Dogecoin, the pioneer in meme-based cryptocurrencies, maintains a strong market presence with a dedicated community that has propelled its value over the years. Analysts predict that Dogecoin could approach the $0.50 mark by 2025, especially if the overall market conditions are favorable. Similarly, Shiba Inu has made significant strides with developments in its ecosystem, particularly with the introduction of Shibarium, a Layer 2 solution aimed at enhancing transaction capabilities and expanding its functional use beyond just a meme token. Emergence of Layer Brett While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu continue to capitalize on their established reputations, a new Ethereum Layer 2 project, Layer Brett , is emerging with the promise of achieving remarkable growth. Market analysts are closely watching Layer Brett, suggesting it could potentially offer returns between 100-200 times the investment. This new coin aims to leverage the security and efficiency of Ethereum's Layer 2 while embedding meme culture deeply into its identity, providing both utility and entertainment. Its initial presale phase attracted significant attention, raising over $3.8 million, indicating strong market interest. The project developers have also planned for extensive community engagement with features like NFT integrations, gamified rewards, and significant giveaways, promising a vibrant community and active participation. Final Thoughts As the cryptocurrency market evolves, the rise of new coins like Layer Brett highlights the continuous opportunity for growth and investment. While established coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are expected to perform well, the explosive return potential may now reside with newer, lesser-known projects.

Synthetix Coin price analysis shows an upward trend regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has increased to $0.689 in the last 24 hours. If the bullish momentum continues, the SNX price might retest resistance at the $0.718 level. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as seen in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $5.24 by 2030. Why is SNX up? The cryptocurrency market is in a bullish mode, and SNX is following suit. From a larger perspective, the token is getting positive sentiment as the SNX price increased to $0.689, gaining 1.09% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $1.21 for the current year, which is still quite higher than the current Synthetix price. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach near $5 by 2031. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach near the $6 level after 2031. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $5.24, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $5.24 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Source: Coinmarketcap Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3, as per historical SNX market data. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The average price of the SNX token was 1.74 in January and has since corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range. In May 2025, it saw some recovery to $0.926, improving its market capitalization, and in July, the token peaked at $0.781. In August, SNX’s average price remained around $0.65, and at the start of September, it is trending near $0.67 as the current sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,SNX|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|BNB|ETH|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-21 08:46:00

In his words, “Buckle up, XRP holders October is shaping up to be a game-changer!” His statement reflects the rising anticipation surrounding upcoming decisions on several spot XRP ETFs, and the potential impact these products could have on XRP’s price trajectory. Buckle up, #XRP holders October is shaping up to be a game-changer! I’m locked inm Who’s riding with me? pic.twitter.com/IvsuYYL1SI — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) September 20, 2025 Rising Anticipation for Spot XRP ETFs Investors have closely monitored regulatory progress after the successful launches of spot XRP ETFs in Brazil and Canada earlier in 2025. Both regions saw strong performance, with 3iQ’s XRP ETF in Canada surpassing $50 million in client assets in the first month. This remarkable performance has added to optimism that U.S. approval could bring a new phase of growth for XRP. Unlike other investment products, a spot ETF enables investors direct exposure to the underlying asset, and many believe this could attract institutional interest that has been slower to enter. ETF Decision Dates in October The schedule for ETF issuers highlights just how concentrated this period has become. According to the post shared by CryptoSensei, Grayscale is first in line with a decision date of October 18, 2025. Following closely, 21Shares will face its review on October 19, with Bitwise on October 20. Canary Capital is listed for October 23, while WisdomTree is set for October 24. The month closes with Franklin Templeton and CoinShares scheduled for October 25. The New Standards for ETF Approval The SEC has already approved listing standards that shorten review periods for digital asset ETFs, and these new Generic Listing Standards paved the way for Grayscale to launch its Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) , which includes XRP, as an ETF. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In addition, decision dates for multiple XRP ETF filings now fall within a concentrated window in October. The timing has amplified expectations within the community that more of these products could gain approval. Potential Impact on XRP Market participants expect that if the SEC allows a spot XRP ETF, it would provide legitimacy in the eyes of traditional finance and make the asset more accessible to investors who prefer regulated products. While XRP is an attractive asset to institutions and has been available on major exchanges for years, institutional capital has generally required structured vehicles, such as ETFs, to participate at scale. The experience in Brazil and Canada serves as an example of how investor demand can materialize quickly once such products are available. Approval in the U.S., with its far larger capital markets, could multiply the positive effects. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to the famous investor, Bitcoin should be seen as an asset class on a global scale, not just an investment tool. Scaramucci made the following statement in his assessment: “You have to ask: Is Bitcoin an asset class? If the answer is 'yes,' then its market capitalization should reach the same level as gold. In that case, large institutional investors will add Bitcoin to their portfolios just like they would gold.” Related News: Analyst Who Claimed His Bitcoin Prediction from Last Week Was Accurate Shares What He Expects for BTC Going Forward Scaramucci highlighted Bitcoin's global distribution, arguing that it has a much broader ownership base than just American companies or S&P 500 stocks. This characteristic, he said, will further solidify Bitcoin's place in investment portfolios in the future. The renowned investor stated that he finds the current price levels low, saying, “If half or more investors continue to view Bitcoin as an asset class, purchases and portfolio allocations will continue.

Traditional banks and institutions profit massively by lending out money they pay depositors pennies for, all while keeping control locked behind closed doors. This imbalance leaves everyday investors feeling powerless, their wealth trapped and their financial opportunities severely limited. But PayDax Protocol (PDP) is proposing a blueprint for a new, mutually beneficial financial era for everyone. It’s among the first transparent, people-driven DeFi bank that transforms idle assets (from crypto to luxury items) into working capital. By leveraging peer-to-peer systems and immutable smart contracts, PayDax puts control, yields, and opportunities directly into the hands of its users, redefining banking, lending, and insurance for the Web3 era. The Centralized System Is Broken Billions of dollars in savings languish in traditional bank accounts, earning yields well below 1%. Meanwhile, these same funds are lent out at rates 10-20x times higher, with the profits flowing exclusively to institutions. This broken model is what drove millions of users to DeFi in the first place, seeking a fairer system. However, the crypto lending platforms that emerged often replicated the same centralized vulnerabilities. Platforms like Celsius and BlockFi, which were opaque and unaccountable, collapsed and wiped out billions in user funds. Investors are no longer just looking for higher yields; they are demanding transparency, security, and a system where they are in control, not a central gatekeeper. The PayDax Protocol (PDP) Solution: A People-Powered Financial System PayDax Protocol (PDP) is designed to be the reliable answer. By building the first people-driven DeFi bank, it gives users direct control over their assets in ways that weren't traditionally possible. For example, a crypto holder with $100,000 in Bitcoin (BTC) can use it as collateral for a stablecoin loan at up to a 97% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. This allows them to access liquidity without selling their holdings and losing out on potential future gains. This same logic extends to real-world assets (RWAs). A user with a high-value physical asset, such as a luxury watch or a piece of gold, can have it verified by third parties like Sotheby’s, securely custodied by Brinks, and then tokenized on-chain. This effectively turns a static, dormant, physical asset into a dynamic, liquid one, ready to be used as collateral for a loan. Redefining Insurance with the Redemption Pool Beyond lending, PayDax introduces a groundbreaking peer-to-peer insurance model. Traditional insurers have collected billions in premiums for decades, with the profits going to the company and not the participants. PayDax flips this model on its head with the Redemption Pool, a decentralized safety net. In this system, a fully peer-to-peer ""daisy chain"" is formed. For example, when a lender like Bob provides a loan to a borrower like Jane, a third party ""P2P insurance provider"" like Jack can stake funds in the Redemption Pool to underwrite the loan. For this protection, Bob pays a small premium. If Jane repays her loan, Jack keeps the premium as his reward, earning up to a 20% APY. If Jane defaults and her collateral isn't enough to cover the debt, the Redemption Pool steps in to make Bob whole, covering the shortfall. This redefines insurance by removing the central entity. There are no corporate underwriters or opaque policies. Only peers providing security to one another for a premium. This creates a fairer, more transparent system where the people capture the profits instead of greedy institutions. Why PayDax Protocol Is the New Standard for Trust in DeFi Unlike centralized platforms, PayDax Protocol (PDP) builds trust through verifiable services and on-chain transparency. Every RWA is independently verified by industry leaders like Sotheby’s and held in secure custody by Brinks. Jumio provides identity verification to ensure a compliant and secure borrowing environment. Furthermore, the platform operates with radical transparency, as the team is fully doxxed, and a robust outreach strategy led by the CMO ensures regular AMAs, podcasts, and video updates. The system itself is backed by an audited smart contract and uses the Chainlink price oracle to ensure real-time, tamper-proof valuations of assets, guaranteeing the health of a loan. This commitment to security and accountability sets a new benchmark in decentralized finance. Seize the Presale Window and Join the DeFi Banking Revolution PayDax Protocol (PDP) presents a multitude of opportunities, like high-yield earnings (up to 15.2% APY for lenders), Redemption Pool rewards (20% APY), securing the protocol (6% APY for stakers), and even up to 5x leverage to generate yields as high as 41.25% APY. But outside lenders, borrowers, and insurers, investors are also keen on the PayDax Protocol (PDP) presale , as it offers an early entry point to a project poised for mass adoption. Early participants can acquire PDAX tokens at their lowest price point of $0.015 before stage-based increases and eventual listings, which analysts say can propel its price by 1000%, typical of other disruptive DeFi projects like Binance (BNB) and Solana (SOL). Experts especially point to the project's systems audited by Assure DeFi , proven real-world utility, and strategic partnerships as a compelling case for its long-term potential. Analysts further highlight the platform's lending pools and RWA integrations as unique drivers for DeFi adoption in 2025. With the Dapp v1.0 already live, the PayDax vision has taken all necessary steps to materialize. By joining the presale, an investor isn't just buying a token; they're positioning at the forefront of the DeFi banking revolution and stand to reap the rewards that may follow.

In contrast, the emerging PayDax Protocol boldly reimagines this landscape, offering a decentralized banking solution that empowers its users directly. A New Vision for Financial Intermediation Traditional banking is notorious for the low-interest rates it offers to savers while charging borrowers significantly higher rates. PayDax Protocol disrupts this paradigm by facilitating peer-to-peer transactions that ensure fair returns on both ends of the deal. The PayDax Protocol: A Synthesis of DeFi Innovations By integrating blockchain technology, PayDax Protocol allows users to leverage their cryptocurrencies and real-world assets (RWAs) effectively. For instance, a luxury watch or a gold bar can be tokenized and used as collateral, enhancing the liquidity of assets that are typically illiquid. Insurance Reimagined The innovative use of a peer-to-peer insurance model through their Redemption Pool is another feather in PayDax’s cap. This model deviates from traditional insurance by allowing participants to directly profit from premiums, thereby ensuring a decentralized benefit system. If a borrower defaults, the pool acts to cover the losses, ensuring lenders are not adversely affected. Building Trust and Security in DeFi Trust is paramount in financial transactions, and PayDax Protocol strengthens trust via its transparent operations. The verification of assets by trusted third parties like Sotheby’s, coupled with secure custody services by Brinks, ensures that every tokenized asset on the platform is as secure as it is liquid. Moreover, Assure DeFi's audits of the protocol’s systems underscore its security and reliability—qualities critical to widespread adoption. Advantages of Participating in the Presale The PDP presale offers an exciting opportunity for early investors to participate in a platform set to redefine the landscape of decentralized banking. With potential high yields and opportunities for both growth and security, the presale is attracting a broad spectrum of investors. PayDax Protocol not only promises to alter the DeFi space but also provides an inclusive platform where users can actively engage in managing their investments in a secure, transparent, and efficient manner. Beyond financial returns, joining the PayDax community during the presale allows investors to be part of a pioneering journey in decentralized finance.

According to the authorities, the group has been accused of extorting more than $115 million in ransom payments from more than 100 organizations. According to reports, the United Kingdom police arrested the criminal after trailing a number of clues, including payments for gift cards from a wallet on the same server that held wallets that received some of the extortion payments. Scattered Spider operated SIM-swapping turned social engineering attacks before moving to ransomware. United Kingdom authorities claimed they have been around since at least 2022, and seven of its members were nabbed last year after several digital heists at the high-profile Las Vegas casino. United Kingdom authorities arrest teen linked with ransomware group The group has been blamed for several high-profile cases across the United Kingdom in April, although two of its members, 19-year-old Thalha Jubair and 18-year-old Owen Flowers, were arraigned in court last Thursday for their roles in a cyberattack that occurred in London last year. Meanwhile, in the United States, Jubair is also facing criminal charges, with US Attorney Alina Habba noting that he “went to great and sophisticated lengths to keep himself anonymous,” while partaking in about 120 network intrusions. According to authorities, Jubair allegedly made some mistakes that led authorities to his alleged ransomware criminal activities. The most incriminating was when someone took digital assets on a server that held ransomware funds to buy gaming gift cards for an account tied to Jubair. In addition, someone also purchased food-delivery gift cards, using them to order takeout to an apartment complex where he lived. According to court documents, which have remained unsealed, the Justice Department charged Jubair with conspiracies to commit computer fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering related to at least 120 intrusions carried out by the Scattered Spider gang, with extortion attacks adjudged to have happened between May 2022 and this month. The criminal complaint only named one of the victims of Jubair, which was, coincidentally, the United States federal court system. Court documents reveal the extent of crimes According to the document, the digital intrusion occurred in January and was operated in the typical modus operandi of the Scattered Spider group. “The Conspirators gained access by, among other things, contacting the helpdesk for the U.S. Courts network on or about January 8, 2025, among other dates, and causing an individual to reset a user’s password. Once inside the network, the Conspirators: (a) took over two additional accounts; and (b) exfiltrated data from the network, including but not limited to the names, 15 usernames, roles, and mobile telephone numbers for United States Courts personnel,” the document read. The document claimed that the digital thieves then used the stolen credentials to access accounts belonging to three users, one of whom was a federal magistrate judge, searching his inbox for terms including “subpoena,” the names of different charged cybercriminals, and “scattered spider.” In addition, the United Kingdom ransomware group allegedly used one of the compromised accounts to send a message to financial services, requesting the emergency disclosure of customer account information. The other seven US-based victims were not listed, but rather identified by numbers. They include a manufacturer, an entertainment firm, two retailers, two financial services companies, and a critical infrastructure firm. In five of the intrusions, the companies paid ransoms worth about $89.5 million at the time of payment. Portions of ransom payments from at least five victims were traced to wallets on a server the FBI says Jubair controlled, with agents later seizing $36 million in digital assets from wallets on the server.

With institutional demand growing and Solana’s ecosystem continuing to expand, many analysts believe SOL could push toward the $500 level in the next bull cycle. While that would mark a major achievement, investors searching for much larger multiples are turning to early-stage tokens like Layer Brett ($LBRETT), which is being highlighted as a project with potential 200x upside. Solana price prediction strengthens Solana (SOL) has proven itself as one of the most reliable high-performance blockchains. Known for its low transaction costs and fast speeds, the network has attracted builders across DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 gaming. This broad adoption has helped cement Solana’s place as a top alternative to Ethereum and one of the busiest ecosystems in crypto. Investor interest in SOL has also been climbing, with speculation around a possible Solana ETF adding fuel to the bullish outlook. At its current price near $240, analysts say a push toward $500 in 2025 looks achievable if market momentum stays strong. The network’s consistent uptime improvements and developer activity give further support to this projection. However, Solana’s large market cap means the days of delivering life-changing multiples are behind it, making it more suitable for steady growth rather than explosive gains. Why traders are watching Layer Brett Layer Brett ($LBRETT) has been gaining attention as a fresh alternative for those chasing high-risk, high-reward opportunities. It’s being built on Ethereum Layer 2, allowing it to process transactions faster and cheaper while maintaining the security of Ethereum’s main network. This combination gives it a strong foundation compared to meme tokens that rely only on community hype. The presale has already raised more than $3.8 million, with tokens priced at just $0.0058. Early buyers can also stake through the project’s dApp, earning around 670% APY at current rates. These rewards will decline as more holders join, creating urgency for investors who want to lock in higher yields. What sets Layer Brett apart from most meme coins is its plan to blend culture with real utility. The roadmap includes NFT integrations, gamified rewards, and a $1 million community giveaway designed to drive growth. With a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens and transparent tokenomics, Layer Brett is pitching itself as a scalable ecosystem rather than a short-lived hype cycle. Could Layer Brett deliver 200x? The Solana price prediction shows SOL has room for significant gains, but its size limits just how high it can realistically climb. For newer tokens like Layer Brett, the story is very different. With a tiny valuation at the presale stage, even modest adoption could translate into enormous multiples. Some forecasts suggest $LBRETT could rise from under a cent to over a dollar in 2025, equating to 200x returns. For traders, the decision comes down to preference. Solana offers strength, liquidity, and growing institutional appeal. Layer Brett, meanwhile, is the higher-risk but higher-reward option, with the potential to generate gains that no large-cap coin can match. This contrast is why many believe the two can coexist in a portfolio, serving very different purposes in the next cycle. Conclusion The Solana price prediction highlights SOL as one of the strongest large-cap assets in the market, with $500 seen as a realistic target for 2025. But for investors searching for exponential returns, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) has quickly become one of the most talked-about projects of the year. With its Ethereum Layer 2 base, generous staking rewards, and fast-growing presale, it is being tipped as a coin that could deliver 100–200x gains in the next bull run.

Solana, known for its robust technology, is predicted to reach new heights, while a newcomer, Layer Brett, is set to potentially offer explosive returns. The Rising Tide of Solana Renowned for its high-speed transactions and low cost, Solana has established itself as a formidable competitor in the blockchain space. Its continuous technological enhancements and expanding ecosystem are boosting investor confidence, suggesting a possible surge towards a $500 valuation by 2025. While Solana's robust infrastructure has drawn developers and investors alike, its relatively large market cap may temper expectations for astronomical gains, positioning it as a more stable investment. Emerging Crypto: Layer Brett's Bold Ascent Layer Brett introduces itself as a high-reward opportunity, built upon Ethereum's Layer 2. This foundation allows the new token to execute transactions more efficiently while securing the robustness of Ethereum's main network. Such technical assurances are attracting attention from those looking for the next big thing in crypto. Financial Projections and Market Movements The crypto market is buzzing with predictions. For Solana, reaching the $500 mark by 2025 is a strong possibility if the current market dynamics persist. On the other hand, Layer Brett, still in its early stages, is projected by some analysts to achieve up to 200x returns, driven by its innovative features and strategic market positioning. Layer Brett's presale success, amassing over $3.8 million, reflects significant investor interest. The token's utility goes beyond typical crypto offerings, integrating NFT capabilities and gamified elements to sustain its ecosystem. Unique Selling Points of Layer Brett Layer Brett's roadmap is robust, featuring plans for NFT integration and substantial community incentives, including a $1 million giveaway. These initiatives are designed to foster a vibrant community and drive long-term value. With a capped supply of 10 billion tokens, Layer Brett aims to maintain transparency in its tokenomics, ensuring it remains a viable and attractive investment. Investment Considerations for Traders The choice between Solana and Layer Brett depends on investor preference for risk and return. Solana offers reliability and potential for steady growth, appealing to those with a cautious approach. In contrast, Layer Brett represents a more speculative investment, with the lure of high rewards appealing to risk-takers.

Ethereum (ETH) remains the stronghold of decentralized finance, but investors are eyeing ETH-built protocols with better potential. Among them is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at a presale price of $0.035. Mutuum Finance has raised more than $16.05 million and more than 16,450 individual investors. With a lending-and-borrowing mechanism based on Ethereum for application in the real world, MUTM is being tipped by analysts as one DeFi token poised to achieve 25x returns in the next bull cycle. Ethereum Market Update Ethereum (ETH) has recently soared past $4,600 and now holds at $4602. ETH’s momentum has reignited following the Fed’s decision to cut rates earlier this week. Analysts predict that the asset could continue higher to create a new all-time high above $5000. Its rise has created strong momentum in ETH-based altcoins, among them rising DeFi altcoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Currently in presale, the $0.035 token has quickly become a top buy. Building a Safe Platform Mutuum Finance has taken that extra step to guarantee security in its platform and joined hands with CertiK to initiate an official bug bounty program with a minimum guaranteed reward pool of $50,000. The reward is of four levels of severity i.e. critical, major, minor and low in a way that each type of vulnerability can be exposed and removed. By opening up its site for third-party auditing to developers and researchers, Mutuum is also welcoming its newest security technology, an additional security and confidence for its investor community. Tiered Mutuum Loans to Value and liquidation ratios vary with the volatility of the underlying collateral. Reserve multipliers from a 10% safer to up to 35% of risk assets constitute the second source of stability. The system is so nicely balanced in terms of access and safety and increased market participation is possible and systemic risk is sustained. Mutuum Finance Presale Impresses Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leading the way in its sixth round of presale wherein it is breaking records as investors jump in. The project has already gained over 16,450 investors and has crossed the $16.1 million capital hurdle. The trend will only continue to gain momentum. Record-breaking milestones like these are a reassuring sign of increasing confidence of the investors with the platform approaching launch time. Apart from buying tokens at a cheaper price, investors are able to realize massive returns over the long term as the ecosystem keeps expanding. The project appeals to investors because of its twin lending mechanism, future prospects, open-source and audited codebase, and transparent tokenomics. Mutuum Finance anticipates long-term growth within the DeFi market. The project is incentivizing early adoption by hosting a $100,000 giveaway campaign, where 10 users of the platform will receive $10,000 MUTM each. The project is well poised to be one of the top ETH-based DeFi projects to watch with Ethereum (ETH) prices over $4,600 now. Currently in Stage 6 presale at $0.035, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already secured more than $16.05 million and 16,450+ investors, indicating strong momentum.

This consolidation brings together leading decentralized AI projects into a single ecosystem, creating one of the most ambitious alliances in the crypto and AI space. FET is trading at approximately $0.6475 , with a market capitalization around $1.53 billion. The token has experienced a slight decline of 0.39% in the last 24 hours. This consolidation aims to streamline the ecosystem, offering a single asset for investors and participants in the decentralized AI space. Story Protocol (IP) is a decentralized platform enabling users to create and share interactive narratives. As of September 21, 2025, the IP token is trading at approximately $12.40 , reflecting a 16.45% increase over the past 24 hours. The market capitalization stands at around $3.92 billion with a circulating supply of approximately 312.66 million IP tokens. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is a scalable blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications. Currently, NEAR is priced at $3.12 , experiencing a 0.13% rise in the last 24 hours. The protocol's market cap is approximately $3.89 billion with a circulating supply of about 1.25 billion NEAR tokens. Render Network (RENDER) is a decentralized platform that taps into idle GPU resources to provide cost-efficient 3D rendering for creators and studios. By allowing GPU owners to monetize their unused processing power, the network significantly reduces rendering costs compared to traditional cloud solutions. The platform has been widely adopted in the creative industry though it still faces some challenges with scaling and higher infrastructure costs as demand grows. Right now, RENDER is trading around $4.00 , with a 24-hour range of $3.91 to $4.02, showing steady performance in the market. These four tokens are still competitive; the yields of the Ozak AI presale and aggressive expansion are set to be ahead of its competitors in terms of investor sentiment. Ozak AI: Leveraging AI and DePIN and Strategic Partnerships Ozak AI is more than just a presale token; it’s an AI-powered service that combines artificial intelligence with DePIN, the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network. The platform operates through a network of Prediction Agents (PAs) and the Ozak Stream Network (OSN), along with EigenLayer AVS, Arbitrum Orbit integration, Ozak Data Vaults, real-time data analysis, and automated smart contract execution. Security is a priority, with CertiK audits and in-house smart contract verification giving investors confidence. To build a strong ecosystem and stick to its roadmap, Ozak AI has formed strategic alliances with Hive Intel, which provides AI-driven market intelligence; SINT, which develops AI-based trading solutions; and Weblume, which focuses on AI data infrastructure. Its DePIN design ensures scalability through decentralized infrastructure, and cross-chain functionality allows the system to expand to other blockchain ecosystems smoothly. Conclusion The hype around AI tokens highlights the potential of the sector, but Ozak AI is clearly more profitable and utility-driven than the alternatives. In Stage 1, early adopters paid only $0.001, which has already given them expected gains of over 1,100% by Stage 6. With more than $3.3 million raised, strong partnerships, and an ambitious AI and DePIN ecosystem, Ozak AI represents real innovation and opportunity. While other AI tokens like ASI, IP, RENDER, and OCNEAR are strong competitors, Ozak AI’s momentum and clearly defined roadmap make it a top choice for investors seeking high growth in 2025.

According to Yakovenko, there is a “50/50” chance that within the next five years, quantum computers could become powerful enough to break the cryptographic protections securing Bitcoin wallets, he said during the All-In Summit 2025 . He stressed the need for Bitcoin to adopt a quantum-resistant signature system to safeguard its future, citing the rapid pace of technological development. “We need to transition Bitcoin to a quantum-resistant signature system. That’s my bet, because right now there’s a convergence of many technologies. The asymptotic pace of AI and how quickly it accelerates from research paper to implementation is simply astounding,” Yakovenko noted. Despite the looming risks, Yakovenko expressed confidence in Bitcoin’s resilience, provided it continues to operate in an environment of open global competition and avoids heavy-handed regulation. Drawing a comparison to the 1970s restrictions on gold ownership, he argued that Bitcoin could withstand major disruptions as long as it remains accessible to the public. Yakovenko also praised Bitcoin’s design, highlighting its simplicity and settlement-focused structure. He described its proof-of-work mechanism as “a masterpiece in terms of elegance and simplicity.” Crypto community divided on quantum threat It’s worth noting that the cryptocurrency community remains divided on the urgency of the quantum threat. As reported by Finbold, Blockstream CEO Adam Back and Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd argue that practical quantum computers capable of breaking Bitcoin’s elliptic-curve signatures are still distant, though preparation is necessary. By contrast, quantum security experts like Chris Erven warn that such machines could arrive within five years, urging faster adoption of post-quantum cryptography. Meanwhile, Strategy’s Michael Saylor has dismissed much of the discussion as hype, arguing that immediate threats such as phishing and software flaws are more pressing. Concerns over the quantum threat have intensified as technology companies continue to advance in the field. For instance, Google’s 105-qubit “Willow” processor demonstrated major progress in error reduction and scaling, while academic research has shown that algorithms such as Shor’s and Grover’s could eventually undermine Bitcoin’s cryptographic security.

Layer 2 solutions, DeFi, and NFTs keep Ethereum in the spotlight, but investors are also looking at emerging altcoins for bigger gains. Remittix (RTX) is drawing attention for its real-world PayFi utility, cross-border payments, and active wallet beta. Priced at just $0.1080, Remittix is being tipped as the best crypto to buy now, offering the potential to grow much higher as adoption and infrastructure expand. Ethereum Price Analysis: Is $7,000 Achievable? Ethereum price is trading above $4,460, and most investors are wondering if it will reach $7,000 in 2026. It is possible, according to analysts, but it will ride on strong demand, wider adoption, and successful scalability solutions like Layer 2 networks. DeFi projects and NFTs continue to keep Ethereum in the spotlight, supporting its long-term growth potential. Ethereum is consolidating at $4,575 currently. The daily chart shows price trading at about $4,433 with RSI 54, which is a neutral market. MACD is positive but flattening, and bullish momentum may be decelerating. Ethereum could start a move to upper resistance levels if it breaks out above $4,700 and holds above it. On the downside, a breakdown below $4,430 could test support at around $4,160. At the end of the day, reaching $7,000 is ambitious but not impossible Remittix: The Altcoin Investors Are Eyeing While Ethereum continues to dominate headlines, Remittix (RTX) is capturing attention for delivering real-world utility and massive growth potential. From its current price of $0.1080, Remittix is positioned to surpass $7 if the project meets adoption milestones and gains traction in the cross-border payments space. Analysts are highlighting Remittix as the best crypto to buy now for aggressive returns, thanks to a combination of verified security, growing infrastructure, and community support. Remittix milestones that support investor confidence include: CertiK Verification : Remittix is fully verified by CertiK, ensuring smart contract security and transparency for investors. CEX Listings : RTX has successfully launched on BitMart and LBANK, with a third major exchange in preparation, expanding accessibility. Wallet Beta Launch : Remittix wallet beta is live, making crypto-to-fiat payments available in 30+ countries and experimenting with real-world transaction use cases. Token Metrics: Over 667 million tokens sold for $26.2 million is a testament to high market confidence and early adoption. Cross-Border Utility : Remittix offers a functional PayFi solution, setting it apart from speculative projects and positioning it for substantial growth. Conclusion: Why Remittix Stands Out Although the Ethereum price is expected to rise toward $7,000 in 2026, Remittix provides a unique opportunity for investors seeking outsized returns from a smaller entry point. With verified security, strategic CEX listings, an active wallet beta, and real-world cross-border payment functionality, Remittix is positioned as the best crypto to buy now for investors aiming for transformational gains. Early adoption and milestone achievements make it a serious contender in the 2025–2026 crypto market.

Most larger-cap altcoins are also quite sluggish, aside from BNB, which keeps charting fresh peaks, with the latest being well above $1,050. BTC to Lose $116K? The primary cryptocurrency’s business week began with a price surge from under $115,000 to almost $117,000, where it faced an immediate rejection that drove it south by over two-and-a-half grand. More volatility ensued in the following days, especially leading to the Wednesday FOMC meeting, in which the US Federal Reserve finally reduced the key interest rates by 25 bps. In the hours before the announcement, BTC jumped past $117,000, dropped below $115,000, and recovered to $116,000. Once the rate cut became known, bitcoin remained relatively sluggish at first. However, the asset went on the offensive during the early Thursday morning trading hours when it jumped to $118,000 to mark a multi-week high. That momentum was short-lived, though, as bitcoin started to lose value gradually and dropped to $115,200 on Friday. It bounced to just over $116,000 yesterday but was stopped and is now positioned between $115,000 and $116,000. Its market cap has stalled at $2.3 trillion, while its dominance over the alts sits close to 56% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView BNB’s World It’s safe to say that BNB has been the rockstar of the larger-cap alts in the past week or so. The asset has marked repeated new all-time highs, especially since it broke above $1,000. In the past 24 hours alone, it exploded by around 10% and charted a fresh peak at $1,080 (on CoinGecko). Although it has retraced slightly since then, it’s still the top performer from the largest alts. In contrast, ETH, XRP, SOL, DOGE, ADA, TRX, LINK, AVAX, and SUI have made no big moves, while HYPE has plunged by over 5%. ASTER continues to chart notable gains, adding over 40% of value in the past day. M and IP follow suit, with increases of 18% and 15%, respectively. The total crypto market cap has shed around $20 billion overnight and is down to $4.120 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

The flagship cryptocurrency reached $117,890 last week as buyers attempted to cross the $118,000 mark. However, it fell short of this level and fell to a low of $115,179 on Saturday. BTC is marginally up during the ongoing session, and is trading around $115,822. Solana Founder Warns Of Quantum Risk Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko has warned that Bitcoin faces a quantum risk if developers don’t act by 2030. According to Yakovenko, there is a 50-50 chance of a quantum breakthrough within the next five years. This means quantum computers will be able to run Shor’s algorithm and compromise existing signature schemes that secure the Bitcoin network. The Solana co-founder recommended migrating Bitcoin to a quantum-resistant signature scheme. Yakovenko’s remarks about the quantum threat to Bitcoin came during a wide-ranging discussion about the next step for crypto. Yakovenko discussed quantum computing, calling it an existential risk for today’s primitives, and a potential economic catalyst as disruptive as artificial intelligence. Bitcoin (BTC) Poised To Grow In Price And Adoption Market analyst Jordi Visser believes Bitcoin (BTC) is poised to grow regardless of macroeconomic conditions over the coming years and decades as the global markets head for a Fourth Turning-style reset. Speaking with Anthony Pompliano, Visser stated that average investors and individuals had lost confidence in legacy institutions, which will drive investments into BTC . Visser referred to the Fourth Turning, a book written by William Strauss and Neil Howe. The book describes the cyclical rise and fall of nations due to predictable intergenerational patterns. Visser stated, “Bitcoin is a trustless thing. It was set up first to deal with the fact that I don't trust the banks. Well, now we're past the banks. I don't trust my employer. I don't trust the government. I don't trust the banks. I don't trust the currency. I don't trust the debt. I don't trust anything, and so, I don't see how you all of a sudden get the trust back.” Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Climbs To New All-Time High The Bitcoin mining difficulty reached a new all-time high of 142.3 trillion on Friday. The Bitcoin mining difficulty is a metric that tracks the relative challenge of adding new blocks to the ledger. Mining difficulty has hit successive all-time highs thanks to an influx of freshly deployed computing power over the past few weeks. Bitcoin’s hashrate also hit a new all-time high of over 1.1 trillion hashes per second on Friday, according to data from CryptoQuant. Rising mining difficulty and the growing need for energy-hungry, high-performance computing power to secure the network are making it difficult for individual miners and corporations to compete. This has raised concerns about Bitcoin mining becoming centralized. Smaller miners and even publicly-traded companies are facing competition from governments that have access to free energy resources and energy infrastructure providers that can integrate Bitcoin mining into their operations. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has traded flat over the weekend after a week of volatility, which saw prices drop to a low of $114,724 and reach a high of $117,998. The flagship cryptocurrency fell 1.22% on Friday, settling at $115,690. The price recovered marginally on Saturday before dropping during the ongoing session. The flagship cryptocurrency held above $115,000 despite central bank risks thanks to a looming threat of a yen carry trade unwind. Meanwhile, the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) economic projections signaled two further rate cuts in Q4. Multiple rate cuts during the fourth quarter, along with a Bank of Japan rate hike in October, could narrow the US-Japan interest rate differential and strengthen the yen. A stronger yen could pressure traders to unwind their positions in risk assets to clear yen loans, potentially crashing the USD/JPY pair. However, strong institutional demand could thwart the risk of a market disruption. US spot Bitcoin ETFs have extended their inflow streak to three weeks, indicating strong demand and keeping prices above key levels. According to data from Farside Investors, US spot Bitcoin ETFs reported net inflows of $886.5 million, taking total net inflows for September to $3.46 billion. BTC started the previous weekend in positive territory, rising 0.49% despite selling pressure and settling at $116,106. However, price action turned bearish over the weekend as the flagship cryptocurrency registered a marginal drop on Saturday, falling 0.56% on Sunday and settling at $115,314. The price rallied to an intraday high of $116,802 on Monday but lost momentum after reaching this level, ultimately settling at $115,381. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rallied, rising 1.25% to $116,832. The price fell to an intraday low of $114,724 on Wednesday. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $116,000 and settle at $116,484, ultimately dropping 0.30%. Source: TradingView Despite the selling pressure, BTC recovered on Thursday, reaching an intraday high of $117,998 before settling at $117,117, ultimately rising 0.54%. Selling pressure returned on Friday as the price fell 1.22% and settled at $115,690.

Notably, several analysts have consistently backed ETH to reach a five-digit price mark this cycle based on varying rationales. Popular analyst Ted Pillows has now shared a new historical perspective that supports this general bullish notion. Related Reading: Bitmine’s Ethereum Appetite Grows With Fresh $70 Million Buy Short-Term ETH Correction To Precede Major $10,000 Rally – Analyst In an X post on September 20, Pillows shared a technical analysis of the ETH market, which shows that the altcoin is consolidating just below its 2021 all-time high (ATH), indicating a price behavior that is potentially bullish based on historical data. Currently trading just below $4,500, Ethereum has been unable to hold decisively above its previous cycle peak of $4,878 set in November 2021. However, the present consolidation mirrors a similar setup from the last bull cycle. In 2021, ETH experienced a sharp 25% correction after retesting the 2017 ATH of $1,400, before resuming its meteoric climb to new highs above $4,800. In applying this pattern to today’s market, Ted Pillows states a comparable correction would send ETH back toward the $3,700–$3,800 zone. While such a price decline may unsettle short-term traders, the Pillows’ analysis suggests it is a necessary reset before Ethereum can stage a breakout. Once this corrective phase plays out, the market expert projects Ethereum to embark on a powerful rally to potentially reach $10,000 by early 2026, representing a potential 100% gain from current market levels.

This milestone underscores Ethereum’s dominance as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), fueling liquidity and trading across the crypto ecosystem. Despite this achievement, Ethereum’s price has come under pressure in the past week alongside other crypto assets. The prominent is currently trading at $4,470, marking a 4.32% decline in the past 7 days. Meanwhile, daily trading volume is also down by 47.31% and valued at $17.1 billion. In a separate X post, Ted Pillows has also noted that if Ethereum fails to reclaim the $4,500 level, the next key support lies between $4,000 and $4,200. While this range will be crucial for maintaining bullish momentum, a deeper pullback to below $4,000 would still align with bullish historical behavior as earlier stated.

The stock had soared 2,800% since the bitcoin buying spree began. But now, the numbers are heading the wrong way, and confidence in the Strategy model is starting to crack. Other companies that copied Saylor’s approach are bleeding harder. Japanese hotel operator Metaplanet has lost 36% in the same 30-day stretch.

A new crypto vehicle by Cantor Fitzgerald, tied to Twenty One Capital, dropped 17% before even going public. Twenty One is backed by SoftBank and Tether. Public bitcoin holders lose value as market cools All these companies had seen wild gains earlier in 2025, so the downturn is putting pressure on this whole “bitcoin treasury” trend. Gus Galá, analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., said in an email that “at a certain point there are too many strategies pursuing the same promised land and a finite amount of investor demand for similar exposures.” This rush was fueled by three things: crypto prices going up, the Trump administration’s looser rules, and changes in accounting that made holding bitcoin more attractive on paper. But as Kevin O’Leary, investor and TV figure, explained, “The majority of the market can’t hold bitcoin, but they can hold equities.” That’s why institutions prefer stocks that hold crypto, instead of holding the asset directly. Norway’s Norges Bank, the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund, owns 2.9 million shares of Strategy. It doesn’t hold any bitcoin ETFs. State-run retirement systems like CalPERS also own Strategy stock but steer clear of direct crypto exposure. So far, more than 180 public companies have added bitcoin to their books. That’s 5% of all existing bitcoin. Of those, 94 have followed Strategy’s playbook. But about 25% of those are now valued below the coins they hold, says Vetle Lunde, head researcher at K33 Research. “It’s been just a very wild ride,” Vetle said , “and now I think the bitcoin treasury space is getting quite saturated.” This price drop could lead to bigger problems. If these companies stay worth less than their own bitcoin, it might lead to investor unrest — or even forced sales of the crypto holdings. Skepticism grows around Strategy’s future debt funding Even Strategy is feeling the pressure. Short seller Jim Chanos, known for calling out Enron, said on Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast, “It makes kind of no sense” that Strategy trades higher than bitcoin itself. Gus, the analyst, added that Strategy may be running out of ways to keep funding these massive buys. The firm relies heavily on convertible debt, where bondholders can trade debt for shares if the stock pops. But recent bond deals aren’t looking good. The company’s 2024 convertible note only becomes worthwhile if the stock doubles to $672, and it’s currently trading below face value. Raising high-grade debt isn’t easy either. Gus said Strategy’s profit is made of unrealized crypto gains, which makes bond markets uneasy. Issuing more equity would just dilute shareholders. “It all works as long as bitcoin goes up,” Gus said. “But then when bitcoin stops doing that, if it stops doing that, it stops working.” He added that smaller firms trying to mimic Strategy’s model, especially those with no real business operations, are in even worse shape. “They are likely to struggle more,” Gus said, “to raise capital, market themselves as Michael Saylor has marketed Strategy, and drive premiums to their stocks’ multiples.” Not everyone is down. American Bitcoin, the crypto miner backed by Eric Trump, is up 16% this month. GameStop, now holding bitcoin too, gained 12%. Still, even companies losing big are digging in. David Bailey, Trump’s friend, told investors, “The entire public Bitcoin treasury space has been tested in recent months, yet this is exactly when conviction matters most.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",News|Strategy,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-21 10:00:18

Unlike XRP, which relies primarily on speculative trading sentiment, MUTM integrates a transparent borrowing and lending system with real-use features that will attract both retail and institutional participants. For those watching what is going on with crypto today, the platform offers a compelling combination of stable returns, systemic safety, and early presale access, providing an avenue for significant upside from a modest entry point of $0.035. XRP Adoption Ripple’s XRP, trading at approximately $3.00 as of September 19, 2025, with a 24-hour trading volume of $6.2 billion, is experiencing signs of fading adoption despite its strong price performance. While institutional interest has grown—evidenced by corporate treasuries like Hyperscale Data ($10M) and VivoPower ($100M) allocating to XRP for liquidity optimization, and the New York State Common Retirement Fund increasing holdings by 543% in Q2 2025—the token’s real-world utility in cross-border payments remains below expectations. RippleNet’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) processed $1.3 trillion in Q3 2025 transactions, but many partners use Ripple’s software without XRP, leading to stagnant demand. Wallet growth has reached nearly 7 million, driven by retail curiosity, yet developer activity trails competitors like Solana (over 76% growth in six months), and competing solutions such as stablecoins and SWIFT’s blockchain upgrades erode XRP’s edge. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Predictable Growth and Systemic Safety Drive Investor Confidence At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lies a robust framework designed to protect investors while ensuring sustainable returns. All loans on the platform will be overcollateralized, and strict liquidation rules will automatically safeguard both borrower positions and protocol liquidity. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) for stablecoins will allow borrowers to maximize capital without compromising systemic stability, while a carefully calibrated reserve factor will accumulate interest and strengthen the on-chain treasury. These mechanisms will ensure that participants enjoy predictable borrowing costs and a lower risk profile, differentiating MUTM from many other high-volatility crypto coins. The platform will employ an initial rate lock and higher starting rates for borrowers, complemented by rebalancing conditions that adjust based on utilization and market fluctuations. This will make lending and borrowing more predictable, encouraging larger participation from whales and retail investors alike. Deposit and borrow caps, combined with a restricted collateralization mode, will further protect the system from extreme market swings, ensuring that growth remains sustainable even during periods of heightened crypto market uncertainty. Presale Momentum and Strategic Investor Access Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, having raised $16.1 million with 44% of 170 million tokens already sold. The current price stands at $0.035, with more than 16,450 holders registered. Phase 7 will feature a 15% price increase, creating a critical opportunity for investors to secure discounted tokens before the next phase. Early adopters have already seen remarkable growth: Phase 2 buyers at $0.015 are up 2.3x on paper, and Phase 6 investors will gain early exposure to the upcoming beta launch and Layer-2 integration, providing faster transactions and lower fees. The combination of presale discounts and hands-on platform experience will generate strong demand and position MUTM for substantial post-launch momentum. Several factors will reinforce investor interest and adoption. The beta launch will allow users to experience real platform features, demonstrating utility beyond speculation. Layer-2 integration will reduce transaction fees and increase speed, attracting high-frequency users and improving liquidity. Revenue from lending and borrowing will be repurchased as MUTM for mtToken stakers through a buy-and-distribute mechanism, creating continuous buy pressure and sustaining token demand. Additionally, anticipated exchange listings on platforms such as Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, MEXC, and Kraken will expand visibility, improve liquidity, and encourage widespread adoption. The upcoming launch of a decentralized stablecoin will further enhance MUTM’s utility, increasing use-case adoption and creating a broader ecosystem for participants. Security and Community Incentives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) prioritizes security and transparency. The platform has undergone a rigorous CertiK audit, including Manual Review and Static Analysis, resulting in a Token Scan Score of 90 and Skynet Score of 79. A $50,000 Bug Bounty Program will reward participants for identifying vulnerabilities, while a $100,000 ongoing giveaway will engage the community and incentivize early participation. These security measures will provide additional assurance to investors, reinforcing confidence in the platform as they pursue strategic crypto investment. Conclusion In conclusion, while XRP faces diminishing adoption, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a comprehensive framework combining overcollateralized lending, predictable borrowing costs, beta access, Layer-2 efficiency, buybacks, and expanding utility. These factors create a structured environment for both retail and institutional investors, making the $2 target achievable for those entering at the current $0.035 presale price. With systemic safety, hands-on beta experience, and growing demand drivers, MUTM positions itself as a leading cryptocurrency for significant returns in today’s evolving market landscape.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-is-on-track-to-hit-4-faster-than-most-expect-heres-why/,"Market participants have been closely watching XRP’s price action as it consolidates after months of price swings. Amid this backdrop, John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire), a respected cryptocurrency analyst on X, has published a chart showing XRP’s price structure with intriguing projections. His chart highlights a bullish technical setup using Fibonacci extension levels. The screenshot shows XRP’s recent consolidation following a significant breakout in July to an all-time high of $3.65 , and suggests that the asset is now on its way to crossing the $4 mark. According to Squire, “XRP is on track to hit $4 faster than most expect.” $XRP is on track to hit $4 faster than most expect. pic.twitter.com/imCIEUwzKR — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) September 19, 2025 Key Levels to Watch The chart emphasizes three key Fibonacci levels: 1.272, 1.618, and 2.618. These levels often represent potential resistance or target zones in technical analysis. According to the chart, XRP currently trades around $3.11, with nearby support levels marked at approximately $2.91 and $2.72. Squire’s chart shows a projected upward trajectory beginning from the current consolidation phase and extending past the $4 level, marking the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, which sits near $4.3 as a possible next target. Price Behavior Reflects a Bullish Base Over the past several months, XRP has formed a pattern of higher lows after its July breakout. The price surged above the horizontal resistance level near $2.9, rallied past $3, and headed for its peak, before retracing in early August, again in late August and early September . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This consolidation established a base that technical traders often look for before the next move higher. The markers on Squire’s chart identify strong buying zones or breakout points that previously acted as catalysts for price gains. By charting this pattern, Squire implies that the underlying market behavior favors continuation. XRP’s ability to maintain its support levels after a strong rally strengthens the case for an eventual retest of higher prices. Why the Forecast Matters for XRP’s Market Outlook Squire’s projection toward $4 highlights optimism in the market at a time when traders look for clear setups in major altcoins. A successful push to $4 would represent a significant move from the current price zone and may validate the Fibonacci targets mapped on his chart. XRP’s technical position, as illustrated by Squire, suggests a strong market structure after months of building support . While no projection guarantees future performance, the chart outlines a clear path based on widely used technical principles.

Key Takeaways: Michael Saylor claims short sellers are using paid bot networks to amplify criticism against Strategy. Strategy’s stock has dropped to a five-month low despite only a modest decline in Bitcoin’s price. Veteran short seller Jim Chanos dismissed Saylor’s claims and renewed criticism of Strategy’s leveraged Bitcoin-based valuation model. In a recent interview with podcaster Natalie Brunell , Saylor alleged that negative sentiment online is being amplified artificially. “A short seller in my stock has actually paid a digital marketing organisation to spin up a bunch of bots to post a bunch of nasty, awful, skeptical cynicism,” he said. “It’s very transparent to me that someone paid some money to create the appearance of a protest.” Strategy Stock Hits Five-Month Low Despite Modest Bitcoin Dip The remarks come as Strategy’s stock trades near five-month lows, falling to $323 last week despite only an 8% drop in Bitcoin from its recent peak. The firm, now valued at $97 billion, has become synonymous with corporate Bitcoin exposure under Saylor’s leadership. However, not everyone is convinced by Saylor’s claims. Veteran short seller Jim Chanos, best known for exposing Enron, fired back on X: “This is a pretty serious allegation stated as a fact,” he wrote. “Most of the mNAV bears have been pretty transparent on their reasoning.” Chanos has repeatedly voiced concerns over Strategy’s financial model, which centers on issuing Bitcoin-backed preferred shares to accumulate more BTC. He’s compared the company’s approach to the speculative frenzy of the 2021 SPAC boom. “We are seeing SPAC-like 2021 numbers in the Bitcoin treasury market right now,” Chanos warned in July . This is a pretty serious allegation stated as a fact. Would love to see the evidence of this, as most of the mNAV bears have been pretty transparent on their reasoning. $MSTR https://t.co/AU4v2JHvqz — James Chanos (@RealJimChanos) September 19, 2025 He’s also criticized Strategy’s valuation strategy, which encourages investors to apply a multiple not only to the company’s current Bitcoin holdings but also to the expected growth of those holdings. “Mr. Saylor wants you to value his business based not only on the net value of his Bitcoin holdings, but additionally with a multiple on the change in that NAV,” Chanos said. “Because now he can leverage his balance sheet, lol.” Saylor’s Strategy Adds 7,714 BTC in August as Bitcoin Dips Below $108K Michael Saylor’s Strategy, added 4,048 BTC for $449.3 million between August 25 and Monday, bringing its total holdings to 636,505 BTC. The latest buy came as Bitcoin’s price briefly touched $113,000 before sliding under $108,000, with the average purchase price at $110,981 per coin. In total, Strategy acquired 7,714 BTC during August, down from 31,466 BTC in July, through multiple smaller purchases, including 3,081 BTC last week. The firm has now spent roughly $46.95 billion on its Bitcoin reserves, averaging $73,765 per coin. As reported, Saylor has joined the ranks of the world’s richest individuals , debuting on the Bloomberg Billionaire Index this week with an estimated net worth of $7.37 billion. The bulk of Saylor’s wealth, approximately $6.72 billion, is tied to his equity in Strategy, the Nasdaq-listed firm known for its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Bloomberg estimates another $650 million of Saylor’s assets are in cash. The billionaire joins other crypto industry leaders on Bloomberg’s top 500, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, currently ranked 234th with $12.8 billion, and Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao at 40th with $44.5 billion.

Key Takeaways: Vitalik Buterin sees low-risk DeFi as a stable revenue source that could support Ethereum’s ecosystem without compromising its values. He likens it to Google Search, arguing it can fund Ethereum’s growth while keeping the network ideologically grounded. Buterin also advocates for basket currencies and flatcoins to reduce reliance on the US dollar. In a blog post published Saturday , Buterin compared low-risk DeFi to Google Search, calling it a potential revenue anchor that could fund Ethereum’s broader ecosystem, much like ad revenue from Search props up Google’s other ventures. Vitalik: Ethereum Can Balance Profit and Principles The model, he argues, would allow Ethereum to maintain economic strength while preserving its cultural values through nonfinancial apps. “The revenue generator does not have to be the most revolutionary or exciting application of Ethereum,” Buterin wrote. “But it does need to be something that is at least not actively unethical or not embarrassing.” Buterin pointed to Aave’s stablecoin lending rates as a concrete example, blue-chip stablecoins like USDT and USDC yield around 5%, while higher-risk assets offer over 10%. These returns, he suggests, could be a reliable base layer of income without compromising the ecosystem’s principles. The Ethereum community, he said, has long been divided between speculative products like NFTs and memecoins, and applications that align with the network’s founding values. The former generates high fees but little ideological satisfaction, while the latter often lacks revenue to sustain itself. Low-risk DeFi, Buterin argues, can bridge that gap. Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has recently rebounded, with total value locked (TVL) crossing $100 billion for the first time since early 2022. Low-risk defi used to be constrained by regulatory barriers and smart contract safety risks. Both problems have greatly improved. For many people worldwide, defi today is in some cases already safer than tradfi. pic.twitter.com/ZC9NKF2DbA — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) September 21, 2025 Though TVL lagged during the 2022–2023 bear market, recent regulatory momentum, including the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, has revived interest. A survey from the DeFi Education Fund found that over 40% of Americans would consider using DeFi under stronger regulatory frameworks. Buterin also took aim at Google’s business model, noting that despite valuable open-source contributions like Chromium and Gemini AI models, the company’s reliance on advertising compromises user privacy. In contrast, Ethereum’s decentralized design offers a path to align financial performance with ethical outcomes. “Ethereum has the potential to do much better,” he wrote. Beyond low-risk lending, Buterin also promoted the development of basket currencies and flatcoins, digital assets pegged to consumer price indices or multiple fiat currencies, as another way to stabilize Ethereum’s economic layer without leaning too heavily on dollar-denominated tools. Ethereum Revenue Falls 44% in August Despite Price Surge Ethereum’s on-chain revenue plummeted 44% in August to $14.1 million, down from $25.6 million in July, even as ETH surged to a new all-time high of $4,957. Network fees also dropped 20% month-over-month, largely due to the long-term effects of the Dencun upgrade, which slashed layer-2 transaction costs but cut into Ethereum’s base-layer revenue. The decline has raised concerns about Ethereum’s economic sustainability, with some analysts calling the August figures among the weakest since early 2021. Critics argue that shrinking fee revenue could threaten ETH’s value proposition, while others believe Ethereum is evolving into a foundational layer for global decentralized finance, with lower costs helping fuel broader adoption.

Victims include everyday holders and executives, as rising Bitcoin prices make them high-value targets. Security experts warn that while threats are growing, self-custody tools and best practices have also significantly improved. Since late February, 35 new violent incidents have been reported globally, a 169% increase in just six and a half months, according to a report by Forbes . The uptick adds to an already troubling trend, as cryptocurrency markets continue their bullish run. Crypto-Related Attacks in 2025 Already Up 33% from Last Year In total, 48 attacks have occurred so far in 2025, marking a 33% increase over all of 2024. France alone has accounted for 14 of this year’s reported incidents. Victims range from retail holders and traders to crypto executives, highlighting the broad scope of the threat. One of the most disturbing cases took place on September 6 in Cambridge, Canada, where a young man was abducted at gunpoint and forced to transfer funds into a cryptocurrency wallet. “He was compelled to deposit a large amount of money into a cryptocurrency account,” said Waterloo Regional Police officer Chris Iden. While the victim sustained non-life-threatening injuries, the suspects, described as four Black males in a dark-colored van, remain unidentified. Speaking in a recent interview, Lopp emphasized that security is a moving target for digital asset holders. “The security landscape is constantly changing,” he said. “It is just an aspect of the ecosystem that any prudent investor should stay on top of, since this asset class is highly unforgiving of mistakes.” Lopp believes Bitcoin’s rising value is a double-edged sword. “It is more valuable, hence there are more felons pursuing to take it away from you,” he said. But improvements in self-custody tools and best practices have also advanced significantly. “We have greatly improved our security best practices over the years to counteract the savvier attackers,” he added. He noted that ETFs can be a safer alternative for those who simply want price exposure. “You trade off things like social engineering risk and poor key management risk for the risk that the custodian may fall victim to such attacks or losses,” Lopp explained. Stay Safe: Avoid Flaunting Crypto Holdings, Report Advises To help users stay safe, the author of the report offered some straightforward advice: Don’t be ‘the Bitcoin guy’ in your community. Avoid publicizing holdings, especially on social media. Self-custody users should invest time in understanding security basics like seed phrase protection, passphrases, and using multisig wallets with geographically separated signing devices. Other tips include avoiding overly complex storage systems that might become inaccessible even to the owner and considering a balance between self-custody and delegated custody depending on individual risk profiles. France has become a hotspot for these crimes, with 14 out of 50 global wrench attacks recorded there over the past year. Moroccan police in June arrested a suspect accused of kidnapping crypto executives. In France, the father of a crypto millionaire was brutally attacked . And in New York, a tourist was tortured for over two weeks as kidnappers tried to extract his Bitcoin credentials.

At the same time, Ripple’s XRP Ledger continues to grow, hitting a substantial milestone in terms of users. $XRP is a BUY, according to the TD Sequential! pic.twitter.com/fY7GTgXEB0 — Ali (@ali_charts) September 20, 2025 The TD Sequential is a widely used technical indicator that shows the underlying asset’s exhaustion in terms of price actions in either direction. As the graph from Martinez shows, the bears dominated most of XRP’s latest moves, especially since it peaked at $3.20 last weekend and has since slipped to just under $3. Although many users disagreed in the comments below, other analysts (sort of) backed Martinez’s projection of price growth. ERGAG CRYPTO noted that as long as the asset doesn’t close below $3 on the daily or the 3-day timeframe, it will be “set for takeoff.” For now, there’s no such closure below that line on the 3-day timeframe, but that could change later today, which might trigger a further downfall to and below $2.90. CRYPTOWZRD also weighed in , indicating that XRP had closed indesicively against the greenback. However, the XRP/BTC trading pair is still “maintaining a symmetrical triangle,” which could send the former flying toward its all-time high of $3.65 if there’s a “healthy” bullish breakout. At the same time, the network behind the XRP token continues to grow, which could further influence the asset due to the increasing adoption rate. Data from XRPScan shows that the number of active accounts on the XRP Ledger has crossed the seven million mark. The basic criteria are that each of these wallets holds at least one XRP.

By 2028, DOGE may potentially achieve a peak price of $1.04. By 2031, DOGE might touch $1.69 with an average trading price of $1.62. Propelled by a dedicated community of part-time developers and enthusiastic internet supporters, Dogecoin is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Despite relying on borrowed code due to limited resources, its popularity continues to soar, with tens of thousands of social media followers advocating for supply limitations. Having touched its ATH at $0.7376, will DOGE reach $1? Let’s get into the Dogecoin price prediction and technical analysis.

The cryptocurrency lost 1.48% of its value. The DOGE coin is expected to find support around $0.256. On September 21, 2025, Dogecoin’s price analysis reveals a bearish trend for the meme coin. The coin’s price decreased to $0.266 today, representing a 1.48 percent loss since it closed at $0.268 yesterday. Today’s bearish trend indicates a comparatively negative sentiment in the market, but losses are minimal for the day; however, the coin may get some cushion around the $0.256 support zone, as the coin seems to maintain its price level above $0.250. Dogecoin 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of Dogecoin indicated a downward trend in the market, as sellers are in the leading position.

Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating the resistance level, has shifted to $0.302, whereas its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.201. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending in the neutral area. The indicator’s curve has reached 57.46 in the past 24 hours. The indicator gives a sell indication as it moves downwards, as the overall market sentiment is negative today. DOGE/USD 4-hour price analysis The four-hour price chart of Dogecoin also shows a bearish trend in the market, as selling pressure has formed above the SMA, which is evident from the last red candlestick. The DOGE/USD price has been facing decreasing volatility toward the $0.266 level on an hourly basis. The decreasing volatility signals a lower chance of a trend reversal and less volatile price movements in the coming hours.

Dogecoin price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has decreased to $0.266 in the past 24 hours. If sellers maintain their momentum, DOGE’s price might trigger further losses and sink to the $0.256 level. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile, and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and your own research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.475946–$0.605749 level by 2026. Why is DOGE down? DOGE’s price decreased to $0.266 over the last 24 hours as sellers tried to maintain resistance around $0.270 and succeeded. Moreover, sellers are currently competing for dominance over the price action. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.324508 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by March 2026. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support can push this meme coin to $1 by 2028. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 2,305 DOGE in September; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is trading below the year’s peak price of $0.414, which was observed on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.69 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial. Recent news/opinion on Dogecoin Cryptopolitan reported that Elon Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, will chair a new public company that will raise $200 million backed by Dogecoin. Although the company is still in the pitch stage and lacks specific details, it aims to provide investors with exposure to Dogecoin without requiring them to hold it directly.

Dogecoin historic price sentiment DOGE price history by Coingecko 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955, as per crypto market records. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142. However, in May, the meme coin recovered to the $0.249 mark, following some improvement. On July 20, 2025, Dogecoin peaked at $0.274, and at the start of August, DOGE was trending near $0.214.

Investors are now turning their attention to Remittix (RTX) . With experts predicting up to 5,000% growth after launch, this token is quickly becoming the go-to alternative for those looking to recover their losses and invest in the best new altcoin. Pi Network Price Struggles Pi Coin is currently trading around $0.354. Even with the introduction of Fast Track KYC , a new AI-powered verification system designed to allow users to join the Mainnet faster, the update failed to generate significant momentum. The token’s price even fell by 0.5% over the last 24 hours. One of Pi’s biggest issues is its lack of major exchange listings. On September 18, daily volume was just $30 million, compared to a $2.94 billion market cap, showing a volume-to-market-cap ratio of just 1.06%. Recently, a whale purchased 376 million PI tokens worth $134 million, sparking temporary excitement. Analysts believe that if Pi Coin can break above $0.360, it could rise to $0.381, signaling a potential reversal. However, failure to maintain this level could see the token slip to $0.343 or lower, extending its downtrend. source: BeInCrypto on TradingView Why Remittix Is Capturing Investor Attention Remittix has become the best crypto under $1 . The project has already raised over $26,2 million and sold over 667 million tokens at $0.1080 each. The first exchange listings are also already locked in with BitMart and LBank. Security and trust are key factors in any successful crypto project and Remittix has delivered on both fronts. It recently passed a CertiK security audit, one of the most trusted assessments in the industry. The Beta Wallet is already live, allowing users to store and manage their tokens seamlessly. To further boost community engagement, Remittix has introduced a 15% USDT referral program, which lets users earn instant rewards daily. Here’s why investors are excited about Remittix : RTX will debut on BitMart and LBank, opening it up to global traders and boosting liquidity. With $26,2 million+ raised, RTX has proven its strength and investor trust even before going live. Targeting the international payments market gives Remittix a powerful foundation for long-term growth. Analysts predict RTX could experience 5,000% gains as exchange listings and adoption accelerate. The referral program offers investors a way to earn real daily income while expanding the network. Remittix Could Deliver 5,000% Gains While Pi may eventually rebound, Remittix is the next 100x crypto . For those who missed the early price surge or are looking to recover from Pi Coin losses, RTX could be the viral altcoin that delivers 5,000% growth and beyond.

Whale Alert recently reported the movement of 70,000 Ethereum (ETH) from Binance to its Beacon Deposit wallet. This substantial transaction, valued at approximately $312 million, signals strategic shifts from a major player. What does this intriguing ETH transfer mean for Binance, Ethereum, and the broader crypto market? Let’s explore its potential implications. What Does This Massive ETH Transfer Signify? This recent ETH transfer to a Beacon Deposit wallet clearly indicates Binance’s commitment to the Ethereum 2.0 (Consensus Layer) upgrade. The Beacon Deposit contract is the gateway for entities to participate in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus. ETH sent here is earmarked for staking, used to validate transactions and secure the network. Understanding the Beacon Deposit: It’s a one-way contract where ETH is locked up. Locked funds become network validators, earning rewards. This specific ETH transfer from Binance’s hot wallet to its staking wallet suggests a strategic decision. It indicates an increase in their staking pool or establishing a new one. This represents a long-term commitment to Ethereum’s ecosystem, moving assets from active trading liquidity to a yield-generating role. Decoding Binance’s Strategic Move with This ETH Transfer Why would Binance execute such a substantial ETH transfer ? Several strategic motivations are likely. Primarily, it underscores Binance’s role as a significant validator on the Ethereum network. Staking a large amount of ETH allows Binance to earn staking rewards and strengthens its position within the ecosystem. Potential Reasons for the Transfer: Increased Staking Yields: Greater rewards from network validation. Enhanced Network Security: Larger staked amount contributes to Ethereum’s security. Client Staking Services: Could be client or corporate funds for staking. Long-Term Bullish Outlook: Signals confidence in Ethereum’s future. This move aligns with the trend of large entities actively participating in staking. It capitalizes on passive income while supporting blockchain infrastructure. The decision to execute this particular ETH transfer is a calculated one, balancing liquidity with attractive Ethereum staking returns. The Broader Impact of Large ETH Transfers on the Market Large-scale ETH transfers , especially from major exchanges, always draw market attention. While this transfer is internal for staking, it still creates ripples. Whale movements are often seen as indicators of market sentiment. Market Implications: Reduced Circulating Supply: Staked ETH temporarily reduces liquid supply, potentially creating upward price pressure. Investor Confidence: A major exchange’s commitment can bolster retail investor confidence in Ethereum. Centralization Concerns: Large entities staking massive ETH can raise questions about network decentralization. This specific ETH transfer highlights the evolving dynamics of the crypto market. Staking is now a critical component of investment strategies and network participation. It shows the ecosystem’s growing maturity, where earning yield through network security is as important as trading. What’s Next for Ethereum After This Significant ETH Transfer? The continuous flow of ETH into the Beacon Deposit contract, exemplified by this recent ETH transfer , attests to Ethereum’s ongoing strength. As more ETH is staked, the network becomes more secure and efficient. Upcoming Ethereum upgrades, focusing on scalability and decentralization, will further shape its future. Future Outlook: Continued Staking Growth: Expect more participation as benefits become clearer. Network Stability: Increased staking leads to a robust and secure network. Evolving Ecosystem: Growth of liquid staking and DeFi protocols will enhance utility. For investors, observing such significant movements offers valuable insights. It reinforces that Ethereum is a foundational blockchain with strong institutional backing and a clear roadmap. Understanding these large-scale movements, like this ETH transfer , aids informed decision-making. The recent 70,000 ETH transfer from Binance to its Beacon Deposit contract is a powerful statement. Valued at approximately $312 million, this move highlights Binance’s strategic commitment to Ethereum’s proof-of-stake ecosystem and its belief in the network’s long-term potential. It reinforces the growing trend of major players actively participating in network security through staking. This has profound implications for market dynamics, investor confidence, and the overall health of the Ethereum blockchain. As the crypto landscape evolves, such substantial transfers will remain key indicators shaping the future of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Beacon Deposit contract? The Beacon Deposit contract is a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain where users send their ETH to participate in staking on the Ethereum 2.0 (Consensus Layer) network. This ETH is locked and used to secure the network, earning rewards for validators. Why did Binance make such a large ETH transfer? Binance likely made this significant ETH transfer to increase its ETH staking pool, earn more staking rewards, and strengthen its role as a validator. It also signals long-term confidence in Ethereum’s future and potentially aggregates funds for client staking services. How does staking ETH benefit the Ethereum network? Staking ETH enhances network security and decentralization. Validators confirm transactions and create new blocks, making the network more robust and resistant to attacks. It’s a fundamental part of Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Does this ETH transfer affect the price of Ethereum? While a direct, immediate impact is hard to quantify, large ETH transfers to staking contracts can reduce the liquid supply of ETH available on exchanges. In theory, a reduced supply could exert upward pressure on prices over time, and it generally signals long-term bullish sentiment from major holders. What are the risks associated with large-scale ETH staking? One primary concern is centralization. If a few large entities control a significant portion of staked ETH, it could raise questions about the network’s decentralization and potential influence over consensus. However, Ethereum’s design aims to mitigate these risks. Did this analysis of Binance’s massive ETH transfer shed light on Ethereum’s future?

FETH benefits from Ethereum's current bullish trend, with technical analysis indicating potential for further upside and new price discovery zones. Key accumulation zones for FETH are identified between $3,200-$3,700, providing strong support and attractive entry points during pullbacks. Maintain or accumulate FETH on dips; take profits near $6,700-$7,200, aligning with Fibonacci targets and historical profit-taking levels. Introduction In today’s article, we’ll look at the Fidelity Ethereum Fund ( FETH ), which is one of the first ether spot ETPs/ETFs in the U.S., launched by Fidelity in 2024. The objective of this ETF is to reflect the valuation of the cryptocurrency Ethereum, discounting expenses (commission of 0.25% per year). To do this, they directly acquire Ethereum and guard it through Fidelity Digital Assets, following a 1:1 relationship with the underlying. In this way, upward or downward movements in the underlying will determine the gains or losses of those who invest in the asset. It is important to highlight for the investor that currently there are no ways to execute staking through the ETF analyzed. Analysis - Technical Point of View TradingView In this graph, we can see that Ethereum was already on an upward trend after soil formation and accumulation in September 2024. This trend was interrupted by a “risk-off” episode following the announcements of President Trump’s tariff policies, when the market feared the possibility of inflationary upswings and a deterioration in the labor market. Today, Ethereum's momentum is clearly bullish: structure of highs and lows higher than the previous ones, with two breakdowns of resistors (now supports) of significant volume, in mid-July and early August, which were successfully retested, achieving a new historical maximum. After which, a moment of “calm” has been preceded by swinging the price 15% wide from the all-time high. Looking only at the technical section, from Node Analytica in the short and medium term (6 months), we continue to conclude that the upward trend has not ended yet and that there are new price zones to be discovered. In this scenario we propose the purchase or reentry in setbacks, taking advantage of volatility in the short term and setting a target profit taking. The red lines on the graph represent the levels that the price could visit. In case of breaks, both E1 and E2 would be good zones to accumulate more Ethereum. At the top, the target level for profit taking would be in the area within the range of [6700-7200]: area aligned with 161.8% of Fibonacci, where in mature trends important profit taking is performed. Analysis - Market Fundamental CoinGlass Next, we will analyse the graph of the net inflows and outflows of the vehicle in question. This graph suggests two clear areas where investors have accumulated large amounts: 3,700-3,200 dollars. To reinforce the E1 purchasing zone theory, the inflow of capital into these zones usually acts as a support because it represents the price realized in the short term for investors. So, when these setbacks occur within an upward trend, investors tend to defend these entry points, and this demand drives creations by authorized participants, which helps to stabilize the spot and ETF price. In the event of a setback, however, this cluster will be an area in which to pay attention to inflows and outflows to see how the market reacts. If these investors maintain confidence in the trend and the asset by holding the position, or conversely, the unrealized losses will exert sufficient pressure for a cluster capitulation event to occur. CoinGlass CoinGlass To this day, open interest remains high. However, it has relented from the last peaks, recently marking a new record high, and has been consolidating at these levels for some time. To consider a break-even scenario, we will review the sequence of daily settlements. This second graph confirms that we come from several episodes of very large liquidations, both long and short. In recent weeks, except for the 12th day that a significant liquidation event did occur, the pace is more condensed within the deviations of the historical series. This current structure of IO and settlement volume often represents periods of calm that coincide with phases of redistribution or accumulation: the price moves in range, weak hands turn to the strong, and the market takes air to build the basis for the next impulse. Taking the current structure as a reference, it can be deduced that we are in a period of accumulation and forming the basis for a new upward momentum. Conclusion My conclusion, after this analysis, is to keep the asset if you have it in your portfolio. Wait patiently, see if there are episodes of downward volatility, to buy back at commented levels. If you do not have a portfolio, we recommend following the same strategy. In case the asset breaks up, it would only sell at the strength levels described in this analysis.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/big-banks-and-institutions-are-deliberately-suppressing-xrp-price-heres-the-latest/,"Versan Aljarrah, the founder of Black Swan Capitalist, highlighted comments from financial expert Dr. Jim Willie regarding the current state of XRP. According to Willie, large financial institutions and banks are deliberately suppressing XRP’s price to accumulate more of the digital asset at lower valuations. He emphasized that the motive behind this strategy lies in XRP’s perceived importance within the future financial system. Dr. Jim Willie’s take is that #XRP isn’t stuck. It’s intentionally being stalled. Big banks and institutions are deliberately suppressing the price to accumulate more at a discount because of its strategic value in the new financial system. https://t.co/guKWXEEl21 pic.twitter.com/YuqT4RkKq8 — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) September 19, 2025 Dr. Jim Willie’s Perspective In the video attached to the tweet, Dr. Willie elaborated on this position. He stated that what is being observed is not stagnation, but a deliberate stall. Willie said, “Who else is under an NDA? Okay, I think what we’ve got now is a stall. The big banks are trying to accumulate XRP, and not just BlackRock.” He further clarified his view on BlackRock, noting, “That’s not a bank. It’s a disgustingly corrupt private equity firm.” Willie asserted that institutions are coordinating to secure favorable purchasing opportunities. He claimed that entities such as BlackRock are pressuring Ripple to assist in keeping XRP’s price suppressed. As he explained, “They’re going to tell Ripple, help us out so we can get a boatload of XRP under $3. We don’t want to buy it at $7 or $8, where it should be right now. Can you help us out to keep it under $3?” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications of the Claim Willie’s remarks, amplified by Aljarrah, point to a broader argument about institutional accumulation and the mechanics of price suppression in digital assets. If accurate, his claim suggests that the current pricing of XRP does not reflect organic market forces but rather coordinated strategies by influential financial players. The suggestion that XRP should already be valued at $7 or $8 indicates a belief in significant undervaluation, potentially attributed to external manipulation rather than demand and supply dynamics. This perspective also raises questions regarding the relationship between major institutions and Ripple itself. Willie’s comment that Ripple may be asked to cooperate in keeping prices low introduces speculation about behind-the-scenes agreements or pressures. While no official confirmation supports these assertions, the idea aligns with ongoing debates in the digital asset space about transparency, institutional influence, and regulatory clarity.

They reported $4.19B in revenue and $12.6M in profit in H1 2025, managing $90.3B in assets and 4,600 clients across 1.1M users. BitGo’s listing under the ticker BTGO on the NYSE adds to the wave of pro-crypto corporate moves after the Fed’s 25-bp rate cut.

The 50-EMA at $116,300 has been capping gains and the 200-EMA near $114,200 is first support, then $113,200. A clean break below $115,100 would likely open up $114,200 and if that’s broken, $112,100.Momentum is waning, RSI at 41 after an overbought pullback.

Breakout and BTC could go to $120,000 and potentially $130,000 in the medium term if wedge resistance gives way. For long-term holders, this consolidation could be an opportunity. If liquidity eases and institutional demand grows, this range could be the level that determines Bitcoin’s path to six figures in 2025.

The personal consumption expenditures index, excluding food and energy, is forecast to have risen 0.2% in August, down from 0.3% in July, according to Bloomberg. On a yearly basis, the number is projected to stay at 2.9%, which is still far from the Fed’s target. That shift gives central bankers just enough space to deal with a labor market that’s clearly showing cracks. Chair Jerome Powell pointed to that slowdown in jobs to justify the first rate cut of the year, which happened Wednesday. But he didn’t pretend the job was done. “It’s challenging to know what to do,” Powell said. “There are no risk-free paths now.” Despite the cut, inflation remains a concern. President Donald Trump’s tariffs, still crawling through the system years after they were introduced, continue to affect costs in the economy. And even with signs of cooling, no one at the Fed seems ready to relax. Fed officials speak across the country as consumers slow down This week, several Fed policymakers are stepping up to speak publicly. Powell will deliver remarks Tuesday in Rhode Island, continuing to guide expectations without making any guarantees. Stephen Miran , newly appointed as governor and temporarily on leave from his role as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, will also speak. He’ll be joined by Michelle Bowman, Mary Daly, and Alberto Musalem, each expected to share their take on the direction of the economy. Friday’s report isn’t just about prices. It’s also projected to show that inflation-adjusted consumer spending grew at a slower pace in August. With less disposable income floating around, economists will also study personal income data to see if Americans can keep spending. Consumption still makes up most of US economic activity, and if that stalls, so does growth. North of the border, Canada is dealing with its own troubles. The US trade war hammered Canadian exports, causing a 1.6% contraction in GDP from April to June. Now, the July industry data and an early read on August will show whether things are turning around. Tiff Macklem, head of the Bank of Canada, will speak in Saskatchewan on how global trade chaos is still influencing inflation and interest rate decisions. Meanwhile, Statistics Canada is set to release second-quarter population data as Prime Minister Mark Carney’s administration tries to undo the immigration surge that overwhelmed housing. Asia and Europe unload economic data while central banks hold or cut This week , central banks in Sweden, Switzerland, and Hungary are expected to keep interest rates unchanged, while Mexico and Nigeria are likely to cut theirs. In Asia, the data drop begins Monday with South Korea’s 20-day trade stats, one of the earliest looks at chip exports and global demand. China will announce its loan prime rates the same day, with markets betting on no change. Tuesday brings purchasing manager indexes from Australia and India. India’s data will be key since domestic demand has held up even as manufacturing weakens. Singapore and Malaysia will also post inflation figures on Tuesday, followed by Australia’s partial price report on Wednesday, important for shaping the Reserve Bank’s future calls. Midweek, Japan enters the spotlight. It will release PMI numbers, followed by retail sales on Thursday and inflation data for Tokyo on Friday. Those price figures are seen as a preview of national trends and will factor into how the Bank of Japan thinks about policy normalization. To close the week, Singapore will publish industrial production numbers, South Korea will report on both business and consumer sentiment, and New Zealand will release consumer confidence figures. On Saturday, China will share August industrial profit data, a critical signal for whether earnings are finally recovering from months of deflation. But spending by the Chinese government, which slowed for the second month in a row, has made July and August the country’s weakest months this year. The week ends with more updates: Malaysia’s inflation numbers, Indonesia and Thailand’s reserve data, a Philippines budget balance report, and Pakistan’s GDP figures.

Bloomberg Analyst Mike McGlone Explains,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-is-the-impact-of-the-feds-interest-rate-cuts-on-cryptocurrencies-bloomberg-analyst-mike-mcglone-explains/,"The 25 basis point interest rate cut recently implemented by the FED has had a great impact on global markets, while also bringing with it concerns, particularly regarding cryptocurrency markets. Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Macro Strategist Mike McGlone argued on the “Milk Road Macro” podcast that markets are living in a “fantasy world” and that investors are overweighting risky assets. McGlone pointed out that Fed interest rate cuts are not always a positive signal for stocks, citing the more than 50% declines in the S&P 500 following interest rate cuts in 2001 and 2007. The strategist, who specifically categorizes cryptocurrencies as “risky assets,” stated that while the gold market continues its upward trend, cryptocurrencies are more vulnerable in this environment. Recalling his previous prediction that Bitcoin could fall to $10,000 by the end of 2025, McGlone claimed that current market valuations are unsustainable. According to McGlone, the overpriced nature of the market is also putting pressure on the Fed's policies. While the Fed's initiation of interest rate cuts is generally considered a positive indicator for the gold market, it could signal a long-term correction for riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. McGlone stated, “There's a lot of speculation in the cryptocurrency market, thinking 'everything is going to go up.' While there was only one cryptocurrency in 2009, there are now 21 million. This could be a sign of a major bubble in the market.” The strategist noted that current inflationary cycles are usually followed by a deflationary period, and that deflationary trends in countries such as Japan and China could also be a sign for the US. Related News: XRP Liquidation Imbalance: Analyst Explains What It Means McGlone believes markets are “nearing the end of the risk-on asset rally” and expects a significant market normalization over the next three months. He warned that this normalization process could have devastating effects, particularly on overvalued cryptocurrencies. McGlone argued that the Fed's interest rate decisions are made under political pressure, and that this could create a “bubble” in the markets. He considered the recent high correlation between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and the stock market, noting that cryptocurrencies are “risky” assets with high volatility and can experience significant declines during periods of risk aversion. *This is not investment advice.

For years, Bitcoin (BTC) has been the undisputed leader in exchange reserves across nearly every major platform. Yet, on Upbit, XRP now holds a position almost equal to Bitcoin in terms of total USD value, a rare and historic development that first emerged in December 2024 and has continued to hold strong into 2025. This shift highlights both the unique dynamics of South Korea’s crypto market and the growing global relevance of XRP. Traditionally, Bitcoin dominates exchange reserves, serving as the most widely accumulated and traded digital asset. Nevertheless, in South Korea, a country often considered a bellwether for retail crypto enthusiasm, XRP has risen to challenge that narrative. This trend stems from multiple factors, such as South Korean retail investors favoring XRP’s lower price point, making it more psychologically accessible than Bitcoin. Ripple’s emphasis on real-world payment solutions and growing institutional adoption reinforces XRP’s utility beyond speculation. Therefore, Upbit’s reserve balance carries weight far beyond XRP supporters. If sustained, it signals a shift in exchange dominance, with Bitcoin’s long-held reserve lead challenged by assets offering real-world utility. This trend highlights a potential evolution in investor preferences, moving from pure store of value plays toward tokens powering payments, remittances, and cross-border settlements. According to Satoshi Club, what started as an anomaly in December 2024 has now been held for nearly a year. Upbit stands as the live testing ground where XRP is challenging Bitcoin’s long-standing reserve dominance, a shift that could soon spread to other exchanges. XRP Recognized as a Model for Legacy System Integration in UK Economics Journal According to renowned crypto observer SMQKE, the UK International Journal of Economics has spotlighted XRP as a prime example of successful integration between blockchain technology and traditional financial systems. This recognition underscores XRP’s growing reputation as a bridge asset capable of linking the old and new worlds of finance. The journal underscores XRP as proof that blockchain can enhance rather than disrupt legacy systems. Unlike purely speculative tokens, XRP has built its case on real-world utility, delivering fast, low-cost cross-border payments while integrating seamlessly with existing banking networks. This positions it as a leading example of practical blockchain adoption. SMQKE emphasized that the UK International Journal of Economics’ recognition carries weight due to its academic and policy influence. By citing XRP as a successful model, the journal signals blockchain’s evolution from experimentation to mainstream economic relevance, while reinforcing Ripple’s vision of driving global financial inclusion through enterprise-grade solutions. Notably, XRP’s strength lies in its ISO 20022 compatibility, enabling seamless integration with global banking and payment networks. This interoperability lets institutions adopt blockchain efficiencies without overhauling core systems, accelerating large-scale adoption as banks pursue cost savings, speed, and transparency in payments. Conclusion For investors and industry watchers alike, this recognition marks more than just an academic nod, it highlights XRP’s position at the forefront of blockchain’s real-world adoption. As institutions increasingly look for proven, compliant solutions to modernize financial systems, XRP’s success story could serve as both a blueprint and a catalyst. XRP’s near-equal footing with Bitcoin on Upbit is more than a statistical gesture, it signals a shift in market sentiment and structure. If sustained, it could usher in a multi-asset reserve era where dominance is shared rather than monopolized. For now, South Korea’s top exchange offers a glimpse of a future where Bitcoin is no longer the sole benchmark of crypto strength, and utility-driven assets like XRP secure a place at the top.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|EXCHANGE|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-21 11:28:01
52053325,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/axie-infinity-gamers-shift-focus-to-xrp-tundras-wealth-building-presale-opportunity/,1758454191,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52053325.jpeg,Axie Infinity Gamers Shift Focus to XRP Tundra’s Wealth-Building Presale Opportunity,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/axie-infinity-gamers-shift-focus-to-xrp-tundras-wealth-building-presale-opportunity/,"Axie Infinity helped define the play-to-earn model in crypto. By blending NFTs, gameplay, and tokenized rewards, it attracted millions of players worldwide and inspired countless imitators. Even as Axie’s market value has fluctuated, its community has remained among the most loyal and active in Web3 gaming, constantly evaluating new opportunities that promise both cultural engagement and financial upside. In 2025, Axie continues to roll out new content, including the development of “Atia’s Legacy,” expansions to land gameplay, and guild-led structures that deepen community involvement. Yet the same gamers and guilds that once concentrated solely on in-game rewards are broadening their scope. Many are now examining presales like XRP Tundra, which introduces transparent mechanics, yield functionality, and a dual-token economy that appeals to investors looking for more than speculative hype. A Presale Defined by Clarity XRP Tundra’s presale centers on a simple but distinctive offer. Buyers acquire TUNDRA-S, a Solana-based utility and yield token, at a fixed price of $0.01. Alongside every purchase, they receive allocations of TUNDRA-X, the governance and reserve token issued on the XRP Ledger, free of charge. To expand holdings even further, each transaction includes a 19% bonus in tokens, giving early participants larger allocations than their base investment alone. What sets Tundra apart for Axie players is its declared launch pricing. The team has announced listing values of $2.50 for TUNDRA-S and $1.25 for TUNDRA-X, reducing the uncertainty that typically surrounds presales. With 40% of the TUNDRA-S supply allocated to presale rounds, early backers secure a meaningful portion of the project before it ever hits exchanges. For gamers used to reward systems that shift with market demand, this kind of upfront clarity is unusual and attractive. Yield Beyond Gameplay One of the major appeals of Axie Infinity has always been its ability to turn time spent playing into tokenized rewards. XRP Tundra, while not a gaming platform, introduces yield mechanics that echo this same incentive model but in a financial context. The project’s Cryo Vaults will allow XRP holders to lock their assets for 7, 30, 60, or 90 days, with returns scaling up to 30% APY. These vaults are supplemented by Frost Keys, NFT-based modifiers that enhance yields or shorten lock-up periods. Importantly, all staking takes place on-ledger, allowing users to maintain custody of their assets at all times. While the feature has not yet launched, presale participants secure priority access once it goes live. For Axie players accustomed to staking AXS or breeding NFTs for rewards, the idea of on-ledger yield tied to one of the largest cryptocurrencies in circulation presents a new and potentially more predictable opportunity. Verified and Reviewed Trust has been a recurring concern in presale markets, particularly for communities like Axie’s that have seen their share of speculative projects rise and fall. XRP Tundra has sought to address this head-on. Independent audits have been completed by Cyberscope , Solidproof , and Freshcoins , each examining the security of its contracts and infrastructure. In addition, the project’s team has been verified through a Vital Block KYC certificate . Community attention has further validated its profile. On YouTube, creators such as Crypto Volt have analyzed the presale, comparing its mechanics to other active launches and highlighting the appeal of its dual-token design. For Axie players who rely heavily on peer-to-peer information flows, these independent reviews add another layer of reassurance. Why Axie Gamers Are Paying Attention The interest from Axie Infinity’s community stems from more than the possibility of high returns. Gamers who once earned through battling, breeding, and staking NFTs are now looking for diversified strategies. XRP Tundra offers something that mirrors the structure of games like Axie — multipliers, bonuses, and dual assets — but applies it to presale economics and yield farming rather than gameplay. This has sparked conversations across guild chats and social forums. Some see Tundra as an opportunity to diversify holdings beyond in-game tokens, while others view it as a chance to participate in an early project where mechanics are transparent and verifiable. Whatever the motivation, the presence of Axie players in XRP Tundra’s orbit signals a crossover between two of crypto’s most passionate communities.

Alongside it, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a top coin in the DeFi market. Still priced at $0.035 in presale, MUTM has attracted investors with its lending-and-borrowing protocol designed for long-term utility. MUTM derives strength from a lending and borrowing protocol that is specifically designed to be implemented in actual applications, a refreshing contrast to so many market-speculative tokens. The altcoin has been bought by more than 16,410 investors. While DOGE benefits from brand recognition and widespread adoption, many see MUTM as the higher-upside play, combining early-stage growth potential with a clear use case in decentralized finance. Dogecoin Market Update The price of Dogecoin (DOGE) is performing around $0.2786 which is consolidating around the price following the renewed interest due to the introduction of the first U.S. DOGE ETF. The action on the price indicates that the support is being held, and resistance levels are the focus as the traders observe the next direction of the price. A positive level of community support and awareness in larger markets remains appealing to Dogecoin, although there are also a few other new projects with the potential to increase higher, including Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which are currently gaining attention among investors. Setting Records at an Early Stage Stage 6 of MUTM presale is undervalued at $0.035. In excess of 16,450 holders have bought tokens and the project itself has garnered more than 16.05 million. This is clear evidence that market demand is growing and also the launch hype is also increasing. Mutuum Finance uses the Chainlink oracles on ETH, MATIC and AVAX token borrowing, the insurance premia of lending and liquidity insurance. Fallback oracle parameters, composite data feeds and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages are being utilized through redundant security. To this degree, the multi-step approach will ensure that the price information is normalized irrespective of the size of the magnitude of the market conditions. The protocol collateral management is being directly affected by the market deviation. The values of liquidation and LTV are divided on the stability of the asset. Risk token ratio can be smaller and risk-free token ratio can be larger. Its reserve’s multiplier is used proportionally 10% in low-risk and 35% in maximum risk as cushion which does not worsen the diversification. Liquidity Management The protocol works well in both liquidity management and risk management in its attempt to be effective in the transfer of the illiquid positions. Risk exposures are strictly correlated and the level of liquidation is determined. The ETH and stablecoins can be used as security assets to enable the upsurge of the ancillary LTV levels to collateralize risk assets with less risky assets. The opportunity, risk and protocol reserve safety are maximized by proportional allocation of assets class of reserve factors. Dogecoin still stands at $0.2786 with the wave of the first U.S. DOGE ETF and Mutuum Finance outpacing its hype with a whopping $16.05 million in presale where more than 16,410 investors have bought tokens. The numbers indicate not only is there increasing demand but also increased trust in the project. As the bull run continues investors are comparing the safety of a familiar investment such as DOGE with the possibility of high returns of the DeFi model discussed in MUTM. You need to review right now, be it before the next breakout, to either gain your MUTM tokens before they become scarce.

The media outlet RBC reported that the Russian Ministry of Energy said that it “sees no grounds for introducing new bans on mining” anywhere in the country. Andrei Maksimov, who heads the Electric Power Development Department, claimed that the Ministry “has not received any more requests for bans from regional authorities.” Andrei Maksimov, the head of the Russian Ministry of Energy’s Electric Power Development Department. (Source: @EprussiaRu/YouTube/Screenshot) Russian Crypto Mining Bans: Moscow Quashes Restriction Talk Maksimov added that the country’s power grid was now “coping with the load” as miners step up their operations. He said: “We have received no requests for bans from Russian regional governors. And there are no grounds for further bans. Everything is working fine.

In return, several fast-growing Russian mining firms have told Moscow they are prepared to declare their incomes, pay millions of dollars in taxes, and provide national AI projects with computing resources. However, the decision to embrace the mining sector has not come without considerable difficulties for Russian regions. Traditional Bitcoin mining hotspots in Southern Siberia and the North Caucasus have reported power grid problems and a spike in illegal mining operations. There are also signs suggesting that some miners’ efforts to relocate to more populated areas in Western Russia have put operators at odds with local communities .

Earlier this year, senior politicians and regional leaders spoke openly about a second round of restrictions. The first round of restrictions came into to force in early 2025, when Moscow ordered mining bans in 10 Russian regions and Russia-controlled territories. The government said it “recognized” these areas as “energy-deficient,” banning miners from operating in these areas until the spring of 2031. The bans were initially applicable in the winter months only. But in some areas, including the North Caucasus republics and the Russia-controlled parts of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson oblasts, these bans were imposed year-round. Moscow later imposed a further year-round ban in the southern part of the Irkutsk oblast, at the request of Governor Igor Kobzev. For some time, it appeared that a second round of bans was simply a matter of time, with the governments of Buryatia, Transbaikal, Khakassia, Karelia, and the Penza regions all submitting ban requests. The Karelia Oblast, Russia. (Source: Leonid Evdokimov [CC BY 3.0]) But the mood appears to have changed in Moscow. The Karelia, Khakassia, and Penza regions have since withdrawn their requests. Decisions on bans in Buryatia and Transbaikal, meanwhile, have been “postponed,” RBS wrote. Russian miners have urged the government to continue pro-business policies. They claim that their industry is now second only in size and capacity to that of the United States. However, the issue of mining-related power grid problems refuses to go away in Russia. Instead, it appears to be becoming increasingly nuanced. In July, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak instructed the Ministry of Energy to finalize proposals for creating a new category of energy consumption for miners. Bitcoin miner @Hut8Corp has announced plans to develop four new sites across the United States, adding 1.53 gigawatts (GW) of utility capacity. #Mining #Bitcoin https://t.co/TB7D6KOpnz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 27, 2025 Divisions May Be Growing Novak appears keen to find a way to force miners to automatically or remotely limit their electricity consumption in real-time during peak demand periods. And in late August, the Russian Presidential Aide Nikolai Patrushev said that crypto mining was leading to electricity shortages in areas such as the northern Yamal Peninsual. Patrushev also noted that the electricity deficit in the Siberian Federal District (SFD) had reached 1.2 GW. This runs contrary to a recent comments by regional authorities who claim that the SFD has a power surplus. Critics in the region say they “sees no positive impact” from crypto mining operators building data centers in the SFD.

The attack was carried out by teenage hackers, including Noah Urban, an 18-year-old from Florida who became a key figure in one of the world’s most dangerous cybercriminal organizations responsible for high-profile attacks on MGM Resorts and other major corporations. ZachXBT, a prominent blockchain investigator, publicly called out Crypto.com for covering up the breach after Bloomberg’s report revealed the incident. Source: TG/Investigations by ZachXBT The exchange confirmed the attack affected “ a very small number of individuals ” but maintained that no customer funds were accessed. However, the company never publicly disclosed the breach to users whose personal information was compromised. The revelation comes as Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek predicts a strong fourth-quarter performance and explores potential IPO options while expanding partnerships with Trump Media & Technology Group. The exchange generated $1.5 billion in revenue last year with $1 billion in gross profit, positioning itself as one of the most profitable crypto platforms despite the undisclosed security incident. When Minecraft Players Became Million-Dollar Cybercriminals According to the Bloomberg report , Noah Urban’s criminal journey began innocuously through Minecraft gaming communities at age 15, where he learned about SIM-swapping techniques that didn’t require coding skills. His natural talent for social engineering, combined with a deep voice that belied his teenage years, made him exceptionally effective at deceiving telecommunications employees into transferring phone numbers. The scheme involved calling company representatives while pretending to be IT security personnel, using scripts like “Hey, my name is Kevin, and I’m calling from the T-Mobile internal security management.” Urban earned $50 per successful call initially, clearing $3,000 in his first week while other group members listened on Discord during gaming sessions. Urban’s operation expanded rapidly during the COVID-19 school closures, employing his own network of callers whom he paid between $60 and $4,000, depending on the security levels breached. He purchased luxury items, including a $35,000 diamond-encrusted Rolex and $80,000 Minecraft username, while maintaining the facade of cryptocurrency trading success to his family. Source: Bloomberg The Scattered Spider group evolved from simple SIM-swapping to sophisticated corporate infiltration. In August 2022, Urban and accomplices created fake Okta login pages to target Twilio employees, ultimately accessing customer data from 209 companies. The breach earned them the nickname “0ktapus” and made them feel “like gods,” according to Urban’s jail interviews. Following the Twilio success, the group targeted Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group to steal unreleased tracks, with Urban operating a Twitter account called “King Bob” that gained 11,000 followers overnight after posting leaked Playboi Carti music. The music theft operation expanded its criminal portfolio beyond financial fraud into intellectual property theft. How Teenage Hackers Cracked Crypto.com’s Defenses Noah Urban and his Scattered Spider accomplices targeted Crypto.com by exploiting employee credentials through their signature social engineering tactics. The group gained unauthorized access to the exchange’s systems, compromising personal information belonging to what the company described as “ a very small number of individuals .” The attack followed the hackers’ successful infiltration of Twilio, which provided them with customer verification codes and access credentials for 209 companies using the communications platform. Urban’s crew leveraged this data trove to identify and target Crypto.com employees, using their established methods of impersonating IT security personnel. Crypto.com confirmed the breach affected user personal information but maintained that no customer funds were accessed during the incident. The exchange never issued a public disclosure about the security compromise, only acknowledging the attack when contacted by Bloomberg for their investigative report on Scattered Spider’s activities. Bad news: Your team covered up a breach that impacted the personal information of your users pic.twitter.com/1xqmJyqm5i — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) September 21, 2025 The timing of the attack coincided with Scattered Spider’s expansion beyond simple SIM-swapping into sophisticated corporate infiltration. The group had evolved from stealing individual crypto wallets to targeting major exchanges and technology companies for larger-scale data theft and potential ransomware deployment. Beyond Crypto.com, the hackers exploited United Parcel Service systems to gather personal data for future victims while Urban continued his music theft operations targeting Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group. These parallel criminal enterprises generated millions in cryptocurrency proceeds that Urban spent on luxury items and high-stakes gambling. The Secret Crypto Exchange Hack That Never Made Headlines The undisclosed Crypto.com breach occurred as the exchange pursued aggressive expansion and high-profile partnerships. Last month, the company announced a $6.42 billion digital asset treasury partnership with Trump Media , creating the largest publicly traded CRO-focused vehicle with 6.3 billion Cronos tokens representing 19% of total market capitalization. CEO Marszalek confirmed that multiple investment banks have approached the company regarding potential IPO opportunities, although the company maintains a private status for operational flexibility. The exchange plans to expand into prediction markets, targeting sports betting and political events, through CFTC-regulated infrastructure, while building partnerships that support the Trump administration’s crypto initiatives.

The pattern, highlighted by UK observers, showed that right-wing movements were leaning towards decentralized digital currencies. One of the major sponsors, Athena Bitcoin Global, has been accused of profiting from cybercrime in the United States. Earlier this month, the attorney general for the District of Columbia Brian Schwalb accused the company of knowingly profiting from scams that have targeted elderly victims of large sums of money. UK observers raise concerns over crypto leanings Athena, one of the companies that makes Bitcoin ATMs , allows users to exchange cash for digital assets and vice versa. In the lawsuit filed against the company, the DC attorney general alleged that about 93% of the deposits in that district in its first five months were the product of fraud. Reports claimed that one elderly victim allegedly lost $98,000 over the course of three days after being exploited by criminals. The lawsuit claimed that the average age of the victims was 71, noting that Athena did little to nothing to prevent the fraud. Not only has Athena done little to nothing to prevent this fraud,” the lawsuit stated, “but it has instead pocketed hundreds of thousands of dollars in undisclosed fees on the backs of scam victims and adopted policies to prevent these victims from recovering any of their losses.” Over the past months, authorities in the United Kingdom have warned about the threats that digital assets pose to democracy in the UK. They claimed that it has enabled hostile state actors and foreign nationals to secretly donate to political parties. Speaking about the issue, Tom Keating, director of the Royal United Service Institute’s Centre for Finance and Security, said, “The average person in the UK might think of it as being a marginal thing, but in that [far-right] community – which is a growing community – it’s mainstream.” Matias Goldenhörn, the chief executive of Athena, also released a statement saying, “Athena believes the UK must break free from anti-free speech tyranny if it is to endure as a Western nation. We were proud to sponsor the rally.” Alleging that the company has been a target of a smear campaign, he said Bitcoin is “the free speech of money,” noting that attempts to suppress speech or financial freedom only prove why it matters. Labour MPs push to outlaw crypto donations in politics Cryptocurrency transactions can be easily obscured, and there are fears that involvement in the UK political system could lead to uncontrolled levels of cash from hostile states or organized crime. For example, in Moldova, President Maia Sandu has warned that Russia is planning an interference campaign in its forthcoming elections, including deploying more than $100 million in crypto. In May, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage announced at a conference in Las Vegas that his party would become the first in Europe to accept cryptocurrencies as donations. However, senior Labour MP leaders have shared their fears about the prospect of crypto-based donations and are urging ministers to delay the much-anticipated elections bill, creating a change in electoral oversight laws to include a clause banning them. Countries like Ireland, Greenland, and Brazil have all outlawed crypto donations. In the UK, MPs fear that crypto can also be manipulated to artificially lower valuations so they can fall below the reporting thresholds, or AI can be used to make thousands of donations below the reporting thresholds at a time. Labour MP Liam Byrne, who is part of the joint committee on national security strategy, said, “Ministers should not present the bill until they have put in place platinum-plated provisions around crypto.” Don’t just read crypto news.

Some bring infrastructure strength, others rally community-driven growth. In 2025, Cronos and Toncoin are gaining traction with their ecosystems, while BullZilla ($BZIL) is redefining how presales capture attention. The best new crypto presales now highlight BullZilla, Cronos, and Toncoin, each fueling strong investor excitement. TON hype is adding to the BullZilla presale whitelist rush, while the recent Cronos pump has amplified BullZilla presale buzz across the market. Together, the BullZilla presale Cronos Toncoin 2025 trend is shaping up as one of the most closely watched narratives this year. Investors are looking to the BullZilla whitelist for Cronos and TON presale access, with many seeing major ROI potential in BullZilla presale ROI Cronos Toncoin discussions. Market watchers note that the best presales like BullZilla, Cronos, and TON are driving hype, supported by BullZilla presale growth tied to Toncoin and Cronos momentum. As more join the BullZilla whitelist for Toncoin and Cronos presale crypto opportunities, the BullZilla presale Cronos TON frenzy continues to accelerate, making this trio a standout for forward-looking investors. BullZilla: Smashing Past Expectations in Presale Performance BullZilla represents the raw momentum of presale excitement. It has already surpassed $530,000 raised, with more than 1,700 token holders joining its ecosystem. Currently in Stage 3C with a price of $0.00007241, early participants who bought at $0.00000575 are sitting on staggering returns. This trajectory cements BullZilla’s dominance in conversations about the best new crypto presales now. The Mutation Mechanism: Driving Growth BullZilla’s presale is fueled by the Mutation Mechanism, a model that increases price automatically with every $100,000 raised or after 48 hours pass. This ensures dynamic growth driven by both demand and time. The structure rewards early investors and creates continuous upward momentum, an essential trait for those chasing the best new crypto presales now. Unlike static presales, this mechanism encourages ongoing engagement. Investors know that waiting could mean paying more tomorrow, while buying today locks in stronger returns. This approach aligns with BullZilla ’s mission to transform presales into community-driven movements and secure its spot in the best new crypto presales now. Roar Burn Mechanism: Tightening Supply BullZilla also employs the Roar Burn Mechanism, a supply-reduction model that burns tokens from its Burn Pool Reserve at key milestones. Each burn reduces supply, increases scarcity, and drives value for holders. The mechanism also sparks a Roar Surge, signaling progress and energizing the community. This cycle of burns and surges adds another layer of momentum, reinforcing BullZilla’s narrative as one of the best new crypto presales now. Tokenomics: Zilla DNA BullZilla’s ecosystem is structured for growth through carefully planned tokenomics: Presale Engine (50%): 80 billion tokens drive early adoption and community formation. Staking System (20%): The HODL Furnace offers APYs of up to 70% for long-term holders. Treasury & Ecosystem (20%): Funds development, marketing, and expansion. Burn Pool Reserve (5%): Supports the Roar Burn Mechanism. Team Allocation (5%): Locked for two years, ensuring long-term alignment. This balance of incentives, sustainability, and scarcity explains why analysts view BullZilla as a standout among the best new crypto presales now. Investment Scenario: $8,000 in BullZilla Presale Consider an investor who placed $8,000 at the initial presale price of $0.00000575. They would have secured approximately 1,391,304,347 $BZIL. At today’s price of $0.00007241, that allocation is already worth $100,700. This case study highlights how BullZilla is smashing investor expectations and establishing itself firmly within the best new crypto presales now. How to Buy BullZilla Coins Set Up a Wallet: Install MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Buy Ethereum (ETH): Acquire ETH on Binance or Coinbase, then transfer it. Visit the Presale Site: Connect your wallet to the official BullZilla portal. Swap ETH for $BZIL: Select the amount, confirm, and secure your allocation. Cronos: Gaining Steam as a Layer-1 Challenger Cronos has steadily positioned itself as a bridge between traditional finance and decentralized applications. Built on the Cosmos SDK and powered by the CRO token, it enables cross-chain interactions and low-cost transactions. This flexibility attracts developers seeking alternatives to Ethereum’s high fees. In 2025, Cronos continues to grow by anchoring itself in decentralized finance (DeFi). Its integration with multiple liquidity pools and NFT marketplaces has expanded its reach. Reports show that TVL (Total Value Locked) across Cronos-based protocols is steadily climbing, which strengthens its case among the best new crypto presales now. The chain’s strong branding, coupled with exchange-backed initiatives, provides confidence for both retail and institutional investors. With upgrades in throughput and security, Cronos shows no signs of slowing its upward trajectory. The consistent attention makes Cronos impossible to ignore in discussions of the best new crypto presales now. Toncoin: Rallying With Community Power and Web3 Utility Toncoin’s rise is tied to the massive reach of its native ecosystem. As the native token of The Open Network (TON), it benefits from direct integration with one of the largest global messaging applications. This connection fuels adoption at an unprecedented scale. In 2025, Toncoin’s growth is visible in decentralized finance, payments, and identity verification. The network offers near-instant transactions and high scalability, positioning it well for mainstream users. Analysts argue this mix of accessibility and security is why Toncoin consistently enters lists of the best new crypto presales now. Developers are leveraging TON’s infrastructure to create dApps that integrate seamlessly with messaging and communication tools. This unique positioning allows Toncoin to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3, giving it both mass appeal and utility-driven strength. Toncoin remains a top contender in conversations about the best new crypto presales now. Conclusion: A Trio Defining the Best New Crypto Presales Now Cronos builds utility with its cross-chain DeFi network. Toncoin rallies with Web3 adoption at a global scale.

He thinks low-risk DeFi protocols could be the steady income stream for Ethereum, like Google Search is for Google. This approach, he argues, would enable Ethereum to continue supporting experimental and cultural applications without compromising its financial resilience. Buterin explained that DeFi doesn’t need to be flashy or revolutionary to be effective. Instead, it should serve as a dependable revenue source that is neither ethically questionable nor misaligned with Ethereum’s values. He also urged developers to explore new forms of digital assets, such as basket currencies and flatcoins tied to consumer price indices, which could strengthen Ethereum’s role as a backbone for global financial innovation. If you want to educate yourself on Ethereum and the future of $ETH , go read Vitalik’s new blog post. Low-risk DeFi should definitely be a part of Ethereum. We’re nowhere near where we want to be, and this is just another showcase of where we’re heading. https://t.co/1lhYoohtCk pic.twitter.com/OS2rfXqpkR — Djani (@DjaniWhaleSkul) September 20, 2025 This debate surfaces as Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem crosses the $100 billion total value locked (TVL) threshold for the first time since early 2022. That milestone shows both the recovery from the bear market and Ethereum’s continued dominance in DeFi. According to DefiLlama data, Ethereum and its layer-2 solutions have 64.5% of total TVL, while Solana has less than 9%. Onchain Activity Signals Strength Ethereum’s fundamentals are improving in step with its DeFi resurgence. Fees on the network have increased by 40% over the past week, while the number of active wallet addresses has risen by 10%. Because all Ethereum transactions require ETH, higher usage directly contributes to demand for the token. Rising fees also benefit validators, improving network security while fueling Ethereum’s automated burn mechanism, which steadily reduces supply. This combination of higher activity and structural supply reduction reinforces Ethereum’s long-term investment case. Caption: Blockchains ranked by 7-day fees, USD. Source: Nansen At the same time, decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes have exceeded $3.5 trillion, showing Ethereum’s unmatched scale in decentralized applications. Despite this strength, ETH has struggled in recent sessions, down 4.15% on the week and trading near $4,468. Daily trading volume has slipped more than 30% to $18 billion, reflecting a quieter but consolidating market. Ethereum (ETH/USD) Price Prediction – Technical Outlook Ethereum’s price prediction appears neutral, as the cryptocurrency is trading within a narrowing range, with price action confined to a symmetrical triangle since mid-September. The 50-day EMA at $4,519 has capped gains, while the 200-day EMA at $4,394 continues to act as support. Volatility remains muted, but triangles like this usually resolve with a decisive move. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum indicators show a market leaning cautious. The RSI at 40 reflects weakening strength, while repeated upper wicks near $4,587 highlight supply pressure. Still, the rising base of the pattern signals buyers are defending the $4,418–$4,394 zone. A break below $4,394 would expose $4,350 and potentially $4,280. On the upside, reclaiming $4,520 could reopen $4,587 and $4,670, with a measured breakout pointing toward $4,760 and even $5,000. For traders, watching for bullish candles near support is key. For investors, consolidation here could prove to be the foundation for Ethereum’s next major rally into 2026. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining BTC’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $17.3 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012955—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses. You can buy HYPER tokens on the official Bitcoin Hyper website using crypto or a bank card.

For many traders, this resistance line is turning into a major test: will ADA be able to break through or continue to bounce below? Meanwhile, a newer project is rising fast, with features and momentum that put it on the radar of many seeking the best crypto Investment this year. Remittix is making waves not just because of speculation but because of its real-world utility, firm security credentials and early traction. What’s Going On With Cardano Price Cardano price is facing strong resistance at the $1.00 level. ADA has made several attempts to push above that threshold but has repeatedly failed to secure it as a support. Currently, ADA trades in a range near $0.90–$0.95, with support down around $0.85 to $0.88. Falling below that zone could risk a deeper pullback. Technical data shows that Cardano topped at the 1.272 Fib last cycle. Analysts say that similar price action now points to a $3–$6 range for this cycle. Some analysts are pointing to whale activity: large ADA holders have been lightening positions as the price nears $1. Remittix (RTX): The New Altcoin Poised for Growth Remittix is designed to tackle global payments and cross-border transfers with both crypto and fiat. Its architecture is not just about hype: it offers real-world features, strong security and growing market visibility. The team is verified by CertiK, which is a big deal in crypto security. Its wallet is in beta and community members are actively testing it. Listings on centralized exchanges such as BitMart and LBank are confirmed. There is an ongoing referral reward system: refer someone and get a 15% bonus paid in USDT directly to your wallet. Key Highlights of Remittix Utility-first token powering real transaction volume Real-World Utility: Built for actual use — not just speculation Security First: Audited by CertiK, one of the top blockchain security firms Built for borderless payments with global reach Additionally, the project is running a $250,000 giveaway and the wallet beta testing is live among community members. The team has confirmed centralized exchange listings on BitMart and LBank. Time to Act on Remittix Remittix is not just hype. It shows signs of being a real world changing project. This is a product in progress, with a growing user base and early incentives like a 15% referral USDT bonuses daily and a $250,000 giveaway. If you want to invest in crypto with real utility, one of the top crypto under $1 or a low cap crypto gem that could become the next big altcoin 2025, Remittix may be one of the best to buy now. Cardano has promise and upside but the chance to get in early with Remittix, before further CEX listings or broader adoption, might give you better risk-to-reward.

Here's What TradFi Is Asking Wall Street Analysts,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/09/19/am-i-too-late-to-invest-in-crypto-here-s-what-tradfi-is-asking-wall-street-analysts,"Crypto, like the early days of the internet boom, is still in a ""1996"" phase with more room to grow, Jefferies analysts told large institutional investors in a client Q&A report. The investment bank, which launched full coverage of the digital assets sector in September, said it is getting strong and diverse interest from its clients. One of the main questions that analysts are fielding is, ""Am I too late to invest?"" to which the analysts, led by Andrew Moss, have answered, ""Relative to the internet, it's 1996 for the digital asset ecosystem, and the next leg of growth has just begun."" By drawing parallels to ""1996,"" Jefferies paints a powerful and specific picture of Wall Street during the early days of the Internet — one that implies that crypto's next leg of growth has only just begun. The bank is referring to an era when the Internet was just hitting the mainstream. Netscape Navigator was battling Internet Explorer for dominance, Amazon was a fledgling online bookstore a year away from its IPO, and Google’s search engine wouldn't even exist for another two years. Jefferies' rationale for this ""still early"" thesis is that only a handful of traditional funds currently have exposure to the crypto industry, but that's changing — and that's a good sign. ""Many are actively developing investment strategies and determining how to allocate funds across tokens, ETFs, digital asset treasury companies (DATs) and public companies with exposure,"" Moss wrote in a research note last week. Not just BTC So, where do Jefferies analysts see this opportunity for institutional investors? Spoiler alert: It's not just bitcoin and blockchain's original payments use case. Rather, analysts said, investors should look beyond that. ""Our view is that too much focus on bitcoin and BTC's price will distract from blockchain technology's disruption potential across industries,"" the analysts wrote. Jefferies noted that clients are considering exchange-traded funds and digital asset treasury (DATs) companies to gain exposure to the sector, and the bank's analysts see this as a potential short-term bull case. ETFs might remove the final barrier for institutional investments, while DATs could also drive demand for tokens, as these treasury companies are actively and continuously buying up tokens for which they have raised capital. The $1 trillion public market ETFs and DATs aside, Jefferies sees more long-term bull cases in the digital asset sector: tokenization and initial public offerings (IPOs). With more financial institutions tokenizing assets to enable 24/7 trading and real-time settlement, the Jefferies analysts see ""a paradigm shift"" in blockchain network activity, higher transaction volume and greater value for tokenholders, which could accelerate the next leg of digital asset growth. And then there are initial public offerings (IPOs), a trend that has picked up steam this cycle, which has seen several companies, including Circle, Bullish (CoinDesk's parent company), and Gemini, going public. Jefferies expects this trend to only pick up in the next 18-24 months and balloon to a massive market in the next five years. While exchanges were first to go public, the bank sees a go-public opportunity for distributed ledger developers, tokenization platforms, custodians, token on-off ramps, stablecoin issuers, analytics companies, institutional trading and staking platforms, fund managers and prime brokers. ""We reiterate our expectation for 10-15 IPOs over the next 18-24 months and a $1 [trillion] public market sector over the next 5 years,"" the analysts wrote. Playbook as old as dot-com era Driving home the parallel of the 1996 internet era, the firm's advice to clients asking how to invest echoes the lessons of the early Internet: be selective and focus on lasting utility. The analysts pointed out that only six of the top 20 tokens from January 2018 remain in the top 20 today — a dynamic similar to the dot-com era, when early leaders like AltaVista and Lycos were eventually displaced. A great divergence is expected to continue as capital shifts from speculative assets to tokens that power real applications. The playbook, Jefferies suggests, is to analyze tokens like early-stage tech startups, prioritizing “adoption, development, usage and use case” over fleeting revenue spikes of some blockchains.",Finance|Crypto|Jefferies|Analysts|Blockchain|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-21 12:00:00

Based on reports from Martinez, the TD Sequential on the four-hour chart flashed a buy signal. That indicator is used by many traders to spot when a trend may stop and reverse. Martinez said recent consolidation improved the odds for buyers, and that the shorter-term trend now favors upward movement. Both analysts emphasized patterns and indicators rather than a fixed timetable for any rally. Institutional Moves Add Liquidity Reports have disclosed that the first US spot XRP ETF began trading this week, a development many see as a sign of growing institutional access. At the same time, the CME Group has plans to launch futures options for XRP and Solana, which could bring more professional traders and deeper liquidity. $XRP looks to be preparing here for ANOTHER +226% SURGE TO $9.90+ and a break above could send it towards $20 and higher! pic.twitter.com/ia5jJOcdkp — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) September 19, 2025 Tokenized fund plans on the XRP Ledger have also surfaced; those funds would trade like tokens and give investors regulated exposure with faster settlement, according to sources. Market reaction has been cautious. XRP has been holding above $3, but price action slowed as it neared resistance. Traders are now watching whether the token can push beyond the next supply zone or retreat back into consolidation. XRP market cap currently at $178 billion.

CEO Sees Bitcoin Exploding 200x – Here’s More Carbon Market Could Create Demand Meanwhile, there is a separate line of discussion that links XRP to tokenized carbon credits. Based on a Precedence Research projection cited in reports, the carbon credit market could expand from about $933 billion in 2025 to more than $16 trillion by 2034. Other research pointed to the carbon offsets segment being around $1.06 trillion in 2023 and possibly rising past $3 trillion by 2032. If tokenization of credits gains scale, those working on market plumbing say fast, low-cost rails could be useful. The XRP Ledger is reported to be carbon neutral, which supporters argue could make it an attractive option for moving tokenized credits. Still, this is a hypothetical demand case and no clear model ties that potential directly to a specific XRP price level.

The report includes remarks on the potential role of private tokens in payment systems and provides an assessment of the suitability of existing cryptocurrencies for settlement purposes. The working paper, identified as WP3/2025, is explicitly labelled as research in progress, carrying the usual disclaimer that its contents represent the authors’ views and not formal policy positions of Bank Negara Malaysia. Nonetheless, SMQKE emphasized the importance of key passages within the document that outline the potential role of private tokens such as XRP in future payment systems. 2025 CENTRAL BANK OF MALAYSIA REPORT CLAIMS XRP MAY REPLACE BANK DEPOSITS AS BITCOIN AND ETHEREUM DEEMED UNSUITABLE FOR PAYMENT SYSTEMS “Private tokens such as XRP may be widely used as means of payment outside the banking system in the future, replacing CIC or bank… pic.twitter.com/FmlcmczHc0 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 20, 2025 Reference to XRP in the Report One section of the paper referenced in the tweet states: “Private tokens such as Bitcoin or XRP may be widely used as means of payment outside the banking system in the future, replacing CIC or bank deposits.” In this context, CIC refers to cash in circulation, while deposits represent balances held within the traditional banking framework. This remark illustrates that the authors recognize scenarios in which privately issued digital assets could play roles beyond current monetary and deposit structures. The wording in the document suggests that private tokens could evolve into recognized mediums of exchange that operate parallel to or outside the existing banking ecosystem. This projection is presented as a possible outcome in light of ongoing developments in digital money, including central bank digital currency initiatives. Assessment of Bitcoin and Ether The images attached to SMQKE’s post also show another section of the report addressing the role of Bitcoin and Ether. The authors note: “Crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ether are unsuitable as payment instruments for most DLT use cases due to their high volatility and low scalability.” This judgment aligns with long-standing concerns in policy and research circles regarding the limited capacity of these networks to handle large-scale retail or wholesale payments while maintaining stability. The report also includes diagrams comparing DLT-based and account-based payment models, as well as potential hybrid solutions. These visual explanations illustrate the technical challenges associated with integrating certain cryptocurrencies into regulated financial infrastructure, particularly when stability and transaction throughput are key requirements.

The authors explore distinctions between public and private money, token-based and account-based systems, and potential designs for central bank-issued digital currencies. The paper also reviews bridge solutions that could connect distributed ledger contract execution platforms with existing account-based settlement systems. This reflects an interest in ensuring scalability, interoperability, and compliance as potential digital currency frameworks are evaluated. Taken together, the paper and SMQKE’s summary underline ongoing research into the evolving relationship between central bank-issued money, private digital assets, and the technical infrastructure that underpins modern payments.

Uniswap price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends, as the coin’s price is decreasing after a continued bearish wave observed over the current trading session. If sellers hold the ongoing momentum, UNI’s price might plunge below the $9 range. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $36.22 level by 2027 and above $74.36 by 2031. Why is UNI down? The broader crypto market is experiencing a bearish phase today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are shedding value, and so is UNI. As sellers gained ground around $9.27, negative sentiment returned to the market. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $17.16, while the average price is expected to be around $14.30. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just above the $9 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $10 and $10.7; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2026. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $74.36 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

In older systems like Uniswap V2, an LP’s funds were spread evenly across a price range from zero to infinity. This was inefficient because most trading happens within a very small price range. To solve this, Uniswap V3 introduced concentrated liquidity. This feature allows LPs to choose a specific, or “custom,” price range on a chart where they want to provide their liquidity.

Its status as a store-of-value, combined with growing adoption of crypto ETFs, keeps BTC at the forefront of large-scale portfolios. Yet, while BTC offers stability, its upside potential is limited compared to emerging crypto coins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . For investors seeking exponential growth in the sub-$1 segment, MUTM presents a rare combination of predictable returns, strong fundamentals, and structured tokenomics, making it the smartest buy for potential 1,000% gains before 2026. Structured lending and predictable ROI At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lies a stable interest rate model that distinguishes it from most altcoins. Borrowers will benefit from an initial rate lock and higher starting rates, ensuring liquidity protection while delivering steady yields. The system will rebalance interest rates based on pool utilization, providing predictable repayment costs for both retail and institutional participants. This model will offer an advantage over traditional BTC holdings, where returns depend largely on market sentiment rather than structured mechanics. Overcollateralization will safeguard the platform’s solvency, with lower-risk assets like stablecoins and ETH supporting higher LTVs of up to 75%, while volatile tokens such as PEPE, FLOKI, DOGE, and SHIB will be restricted to 35–44%. Liquidation thresholds and penalties will generate recurring protocol revenue, while reserve factors will collect a portion of borrower interest to strengthen the on-chain treasury. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency will optimize asset use without compromising risk, ensuring a safe, growth-oriented environment for investors. Presale momentum and early investor gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, raising $16.1 million with 44% of 170 million tokens already sold. The current price sits at $0.035, with more than 16,450 holders on board. Phase 7 will increase the price by 15% to $0.040, creating a narrow window for early investors to secure discounted tokens. Early Phase 1 participants who purchased at $0.01 are already enjoying 3.5x paper returns, demonstrating the clear potential for rapid gains. Phase 6 investors will be positioned to benefit immediately after the platform’s beta launch and subsequent listing, highlighting MUTM’s strong short-term and long-term prospects. Demand drivers for MUTM are anchored in its predictable borrowing mechanics. Stable-rate borrowing will expand the user base and attract capital from institutions seeking controlled risk exposure. Reserve factors and liquidation rules will recycle interest and penalty revenue back into the protocol, ensuring sustainable growth. Additionally, Layer-2 integration will reduce transaction costs and speed up processing, further enhancing user adoption and liquidity efficiency. Utility, features, and ecosystem growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will let people borrow money from one another and from businesses. P2C lending will support stablecoins and bluechip assets like ETH, BTC, and SOL. P2P lending will enable higher-risk meme tokens like PEPE, FLOKI, DOGE, and SHIB. People will stake mtTokens to get MUTM payouts, which will keep the open market busy. The beta launch that is coming up will let investors use the platform in real-world situations and test functions like borrowing, lending, and staking before the general release. Minting more stablecoins in the future will make the ecosystem even more useful and create a dynamic environment for growth and token speed. MUTM’s long-term value depends on its security and trustworthiness. The project has passed a CertiK audit, with a score of 90 from TokenScan and 79 from Skynet. A $50,000 Bug Bounty Program encourages anyone in the community to report security holes, with payments based on how serious the problem is. At the same time, a $100,000 ongoing giveaway will keep people interested and reward faithful holders, which will help the community stay strong and engaged. In a market where many investors are scared and greedy because of changes in the crypto fear and greed index, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out. MUTM is in a unique position for quick adoption and structured growth because it has stable interest rates, overcollateralization, liquidation safety nets, mtToken staking, buyback mechanisms, and Layer-2 efficiency. MUTM is the smart pick in today’s market for investors who are looking at crypto pricing and looking for possibilities under $1. It has a good risk-reward ratio and a way to make 1,000% gains by 2026.

According to a recent report from Whale Alert, a substantial 250 million USDC minted at the USDC Treasury has just been added to the digital asset landscape. This monumental injection of a major stablecoin is more than just a number; it signals important shifts and potential movements within the broader crypto market. For anyone tracking digital finance, understanding the implications of such a large-scale event is crucial. Let’s dive into what this means for stability, liquidity, and the future of decentralized finance. What Does 250 Million USDC Minted Really Mean? When we hear that 250 million USDC minted , it refers to the creation of new units of USD Coin (USDC). USDC is a stablecoin, meaning its value is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. This makes it a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the volatile cryptocurrency market. The minting process typically occurs when an authorized entity, like Circle (the issuer of USDC), receives an equivalent amount of fiat currency (US dollars) and then issues new USDC tokens onto the blockchain. It’s essentially a digital representation of real-world money entering the crypto ecosystem. This process is vital for maintaining the stability and reliability of USDC. Every USDC token in circulation is theoretically backed by a corresponding dollar in reserves, ensuring its peg. The report from Whale Alert simply tracks these large movements on the blockchain, acting as a transparent monitor for significant transactions and creations of digital assets. So, while 250 million sounds like a huge sum, it reflects a direct inflow of capital or demand for a stable digital dollar. The Power of USDC Minted: Market Implications The creation of such a large amount of USDC minted often carries significant market implications. One primary effect is an increase in liquidity. More USDC means more stable capital available within the crypto ecosystem. This liquidity can be used for various purposes: Trading: Traders can use USDC to buy other cryptocurrencies, potentially driving up demand for assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Lending and Borrowing: Increased USDC supply can fuel decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, making more capital available for lending and borrowing activities. On-ramps: It can signify that institutional investors or large-scale users are bringing more fiat currency into the crypto space, converting it into USDC for easier digital transactions. Moreover, a substantial minting event like this can sometimes be seen as a vote of confidence in the stablecoin’s utility and the broader crypto market. It suggests a demand for stable digital assets, which can be a positive indicator during times of market uncertainty or expansion. Navigating the Impact of USDC Minted on Crypto How might this fresh batch of USDC minted impact your crypto journey? While it’s not a direct price predictor for volatile assets, it can certainly influence market dynamics. For instance, if this newly minted USDC is primarily used to purchase other cryptocurrencies, we could see upward price pressure on those assets. Conversely, if it’s held as a stable store of value, it might indicate a cautious approach by investors seeking refuge from volatility. Consider these potential scenarios: Increased Trading Volume: Expect to see higher trading volumes on exchanges as this new capital moves around. DeFi Growth: DeFi platforms might experience an influx of liquidity, potentially leading to better interest rates for lenders or more accessible loans for borrowers. Institutional Interest: Large mints often coincide with institutional players entering or expanding their positions in the crypto market, using stablecoins as their entry point. Understanding these flows helps in making informed decisions, whether you are a trader, an investor, or simply curious about the crypto landscape. Why is More USDC Minted Now? The decision to have USDC minted in such large quantities is typically driven by market demand. There are several reasons why this might be happening: Growing Demand for Stablecoins: As the crypto market matures, more individuals and institutions are using stablecoins for transactions, remittances, and as a safe haven asset. Increased Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions might be converting large sums of fiat into USDC to participate in DeFi or other blockchain-based financial services. Market Expansion: The overall growth of the crypto market, including new applications and use cases for blockchain technology, naturally increases the need for stable digital currency. Arbitrage Opportunities: Sometimes, large mints occur when there’s an arbitrage opportunity, where market participants can profit from slight price discrepancies between USDC and USD on different platforms. This minting event underscores the continuous evolution and integration of stablecoins into the global financial system. It highlights their role as essential infrastructure for digital economies. The recent report of 250 million USDC minted at the Treasury is a clear signal of significant activity within the stablecoin sector. This substantial injection of digital dollars into the ecosystem enhances liquidity, supports various DeFi applications, and reflects ongoing demand for stable assets in the volatile crypto market. As the digital economy continues to expand, stablecoins like USDC will undoubtedly play an even more critical role in bridging traditional finance with the innovative world of blockchain. Staying informed about these large-scale movements helps us understand the pulse of the market and anticipate future trends. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions about USDC minting and stablecoins: What is USDC? USDC (USD Coin) is a type of cryptocurrency known as a stablecoin. Its value is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, meaning one USDC is always intended to be worth one US dollar. This stability makes it a popular choice for transactions, trading, and as a digital store of value. Who mints USDC? USDC is issued by Circle, a regulated financial technology company, in partnership with Coinbase, through the Centre Consortium. They are responsible for ensuring that every USDC token is backed by an equivalent amount of US dollar reserves. Why is USDC minting important for the crypto market? Large USDC minting events indicate increased demand for stable digital assets. This often translates to higher liquidity in the crypto market, which can facilitate more trading, lending, and overall activity within decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. It can also signal institutional interest. Are all stablecoins backed 1:1 like USDC? While many stablecoins aim for a 1:1 peg with fiat currencies, the backing mechanisms can vary. Some are collateralized by fiat reserves (like USDC), others by cryptocurrencies, and some are algorithmic (though these have faced challenges). USDC is known for its transparent, fiat-backed reserves. How can I track USDC minting events? Services like Whale Alert often report significant minting and burning events for major cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins like USDC. These reports are typically based on publicly available blockchain data, offering transparency into large-scale movements. We hope this article shed some light on the recent 250 million USDC minted event and its broader implications for the crypto market.

52055323,https://invezz.com/?p=2891569,1758457760,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Analysts say MUTM could be best crypto to buy now for 700% gains before 2026, here is why",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/21/analysts-say-mutm-could-be-best-crypto-to-buy-now-for-700-gains-before-2026-here-is-why/,"Analysts are turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as one of the highest-potential crypto coins in the market today. With projections indicating up to 700% gains before 2026, MUTM is drawing interest from both retail and institutional investors who are looking beyond short-term hype and speculative trading. While other crypto coins fluctuate with sentiment and news cycles, MUTM is structured around predictable returns, robust risk management, and a stable growth trajectory that sets it apart in the current market environment. Stable rates and structured mechanics for predictable growth At the core of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a stable interest rate model designed to provide predictable borrowing and lending. The initial rate lock ensures early investors and borrowers benefit from a higher starting rate, rewarding participation while protecting liquidity. Rebalancing mechanisms will adjust rates as pool utilization changes, maintaining market adaptability and shielding users from extreme volatility. This stable framework allows participants to forecast returns with confidence, a key differentiator from many crypto coins that suffer erratic price swings and liquidity shocks. Risk management is embedded in every layer of MUTM. Loans are overcollateralized, with high-quality assets like ETH and major stablecoins permitted up to 75% LTV, while more volatile tokens are capped between 35–44% LTV. Liquidation triggers, reserve factors, and Enhanced Collateral Efficiency will ensure that the protocol remains solvent even during turbulent market conditions. Borrowers and lenders alike will benefit from a system that protects principal and sustains long-term interest accrual, creating a safe environment for crypto investing that contrasts sharply with speculative altcoins. Presale momentum and early gains The ongoing presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already attracted significant capital. Phase 6 has raised $16.10 million, with 44% of the 170 million token allocation sold at a current price of $0.035. The presale has onboarded over 16,450 holders, reflecting a growing community and trust in the project’s mechanics. Phase 7 is set to increase the price by 15% to $0.040, creating urgency for investors to secure discounted tokens. Early Phase 1 participants who bought at $0.01 are already seeing a 3.5x return on paper, while Phase 6 investors are positioned for strong post-listing upside. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will provide additional utility beyond price appreciation. mtToken staking will allow stakers to earn MUTM rewards, while the platform will use revenue to conduct buybacks, creating continuous demand and managing circulating supply. Stablecoins minted through the protocol will remain pegged to $1, with minting and burning strictly governed, protecting value and liquidity. Lending flexibility through P2C pools for bluechip tokens and stablecoins, and P2P arrangements for riskier assets, ensures participants can tailor strategies according to risk tolerance and yield objectives. Security, community incentives, and roadmap confidence Security and transparency are pillars of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The protocol has undergone a CertiK audit, achieving a TokenScan score of 90 and a Skynet score of 79, providing assurance on contract safety and reliability. A $50,000 Bug Bounty Program incentivizes the community to report vulnerabilities, with rewards scaling from $200 to $2,000 based on severity. Further engagement is encouraged through a $100,000 giveaway , fostering adoption and loyalty among token holders. The platform’s roadmap phases reflect a strategic approach to scaling adoption and features. Phase 1 has been largely executed, Phase 2 is building core smart contracts and DApp infrastructure, Phase 3 will finalize testing and listing preparations, and Phase 4 will deliver full launch with multi-chain expansion. These structured milestones indicate that MUTM will continue to expand functionality and community reach while maintaining security and stability, differentiating it from other crypto coins that prioritize hype over sustainable growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out in a market where many crypto coins face erratic swings and sentiment-driven volatility. Its stable rate mechanics, overcollateralized lending, mtToken staking with buybacks, and governance-controlled stablecoin system provide a foundation for predictable returns. With Phase 6 presale still accessible and Phase 7 set to raise the token price by 15%, early investors are positioned to benefit from the structured growth and community momentum. Analysts see this as a rare opportunity to capture up to 700% gains before 2026, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the best crypto to buy today for strategic, long-term ROI.

Unlike popular meme coins and overhyped altcoins, MUTM is structured for consistent growth with real utility and risk controls. Traders see this presale-stage token as one of the best sub-$1 opportunities capable of delivering up to 30x growth in the next bull cycle. Predictable borrowing costs and risk protection The first reason traders are gravitating toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its stable-rate borrowing system. MUTM will allow borrowers to lock in interest rates, starting higher to protect liquidity but ensuring predictable repayment schedules. Rebalancing mechanisms will adjust rates based on pool utilization, preventing sudden spikes in interest that often destabilize other platforms. This stability will create a consistent borrowing environment, attracting both retail and institutional participants, and generating ongoing demand for MUTM. Overcollateralization and automated liquidation rules represent the second reason for trader confidence. Every loan on the platform will be secured with collateral above the borrowed amount, ensuring that user positions remain protected even during market volatility. Liquidation penalties and incentives will operate transparently, safeguarding lenders while stabilizing the overall ecosystem. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) for stablecoins will further maximize borrowing capacity, allowing participants to access higher loan amounts safely without jeopardizing the system. These layered risk protections will distinguish MUTM from other high-risk crypto coins and provide a foundation for sustainable growth. Presale momentum and early gains Phase 6 of the MUTM presale has already raised $16.10 million, with 44% of 170 million tokens sold and more than 16,450 holders onboarded. The current price of $0.035 represents a rare opportunity for investors to gain early exposure before Phase 7 triggers a 15% price increase. Traders who entered in Phase 3 at $0.02 are already seeing 75% returns on paper, while Phase 6 buyers will benefit from early access to the upcoming beta launch and structured platform features, positioning themselves for significant short-term gains ahead of exchange listings. Additional demand drivers reinforce MUTM’s growth potential. The reserve factor collects borrower interest, strengthening the platform’s treasury and creating incentives that will continuously reward mtToken stakers. Integration with stablecoins and the successful rollout of future roadmap phases will expand MUTM’s utility, while Layer-2 deployment ensures faster, cheaper transactions, increasing adoption and active usage. Together, these factors will create multiple avenues for price support and upward momentum in the presale and post-launch phases. Utility, Staking, and Platform Features Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also let people stake mtTokens and get buyback rewards in MUTM. This means that participants will earn MUTM from protocol revenue that is used to acquire tokens on the open market. This model will keep people wanting MUTM and reward people who have it for a long time. The beta version of the platform that will be released soon will let traders and borrowers use it in the real world before it is officially listed on exchanges. This will give people confidence in the design and operational readiness of the protocol. Security is still one of the key reasons people like MUTM. The CertiK audit gave the platform a score of 90 on TokenScan and 79 on Skynet, showing that the smart contracts are well-designed and the network is generally reliable. A $50,000 Bug Bounty Program will encourage developers and ethical hackers to find bugs, and a $100,000 giveaway to community members will make the ecosystem even more interesting and bring in new people. Traders currently upset with stalling crypto prices and the uncertainty surrounding popular altcoins are realizing these concerns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers disciplined investors a rare chance to participate since it has stable borrowing costs, better collateral procedures, presale momentum, and actual usefulness through staking and lending. The beta launch and Layer-2 efficiency make it even easier for people to trust the platform and use it quickly, which increases the token’s chances of growing 30 times under $1. Final words In short, the three reasons that traders are moving toward MUTM are clear. First, steady rates that are easy to foresee and come with rebalancing protections will draw in a lot of borrowers and keep demand high. Second, overcollateralization with liquidation protections and Enhanced Collateral Efficiency makes sure that risk is controlled while borrowing potential is maximized. Third, presale momentum and beta platform access give early players an edge, letting them see the platform’s progress before it gets more attention from the general public. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming one of the most interesting cryptocurrencies under $1, thanks to these variables coming together. It is set up for huge growth in the next few months.

Susbarium, an account dedicated to Shiba Inu, has sounded an alarm regarding the new type of fraud threatening the crypto world. Malicious individuals are bidding high prices for verified Telegram handles. These usernames are highly important in the crypto community because of their reputation and trust. However, selling these digital identities creates serious security risks for sellers and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. The scheme presents various threats to username holders. After buying the handles of the original account owners, scammers can impersonate them. This impersonation enables fraudulent activities targeting unsuspecting community members. The purchased accounts also serve as platforms for spreading cryptocurrency misinformation. Reliability in crypto circles is dependent on known usernames and established reputations. Once these identities are transferred to others, the harmed credibility turns into a weapon for malicious purposes. Community members may fall victim to scams, believing they interact with trusted figures. Growing Concerns Over Platform Security Susbarium specifically warns against responding to private messages requesting username purchases. These direct approaches often indicate fraudulent intentions. Off-platform deals carry additional risks as they lack official protections and oversight mechanisms. This is also a warning on Fragment transactions, even though they are legal and more secure. Before thinking of any sale of username, the user must take extreme care. The possible outcomes significantly exceed financial benefits of such deals. The last few weeks have been marked by several security warnings that targeted crypto users on different platforms. These alerts demonstrate how cryptocurrency-related fraud schemes are getting more dynamic. The scammers are constantly changing to take advantage of new gaps in the digital communities. Ledger CTO Charles Guillemet provided advice on the hardware wallet users. The security specialist pointed out the relevance of being aware of the risks involved before using hardware wallets. Users should carefully examine all transactions that they make before giving digital signatures. Impersonation Attacks Target Shiba Inu Community The Shiba Inu ecosystem is specifically vulnerable to impersonation attacks. Fake Shibarium accounts have proliferated across Telegram platforms. These fraudulent accounts resemble the official project communications and branding features closely. Impersonator accounts spread malicious links that are meant to compromise the user's wallets. Such links redirect the victims to fraud websites where their cryptocurrency assets are stolen. There are also fraudulent websites that make users attach their wallets to unauthorized applications. Community members must verify account authenticity before engaging with any cryptocurrency-related content. Official project channels typically display verification badges or acknowledgment from established community leaders. Suspicious accounts often lack these credibility indicators.",News|Memecoins,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|MARKET|REGULATION|WALLET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-21 12:38:50

Hayes, in a statement Friday, stated that the opening balance of the TGA has surpassed $807 billion, adding, “The TGA is almost complete, the target is $850 billion. Once this liquidity draw is complete, 'only the upward movement can continue.'” Related News: BREAKING: Bybit Announces It Will List the Anticipated Altcoin - Ahead of Binance While the TGA functions as the Treasury Department's own bank, funds transferred to this account do not flow into private markets, thus reducing liquidity. However, Hayes' assessment has received mixed reviews. André Dragosch, head of European research at investment firm Bitwise, downplayed the claim, saying, “Net liquidity has, at best, a loose correlation with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. I think this is a useless analysis.” Cryptocurrency analyst Noodles offered harsher criticism: “Hayes, you’re lying.

Yet while the SOL Price Prediction remains bullish, many SOL holders are already diversifying into what analysts are calling the “next big thing.” That altcoin is Remittix (RTX) , a PayFi project reshaping crypto-to-FIAT payments and drawing heavy whale interest as investors look beyond Solana for explosive 2025 gains. Analysts Maintain Bullish Solana Price Prediction For 2025 Solana has once again caught the spotlight after briefly pushing past $250 before cooling to $245, sparking renewed discussion around bullish momentum. Technical indicators continue to favor the bulls as a confirmed breakout of a symmetrical triangle and a bullish MACD cross over indicates strength. These setups suggest buying pressure is building, giving weight to projections that SOL Price could retest resistance levels around $252 and aim for $294 next. The Solana Price Prediction charts highlight strong support from both the Chaikin Money Flow and Bull Bear Power, reflecting consistent inflows and higher buying dominance. Analysts argue that if momentum holds, Solana Price could push as high as $418. Meanwhile, enthusiasm is rising among retail and institutional traders as SOL News ties the current rally to both technical strength and broader market optimism. With SOL Price today hovering near $240, holders are closely watching for a decisive breakout. At the same time, many investors are quietly diversifying, with analysts pointing to a new altcoin as the “next big thing,” hinting at shifting strategies among seasoned Solana News followers. Remittix Price Prediction Points To 25x Growth Potential Remittix is rapidly gaining recognition as the project many analysts now call the “next big thing” in the PayFi sector and it is not hard to see why. By offering fast and low-cost cross-border payments, Remittix (RTX) is addressing inefficiencies that even established providers like Wise and Stripe still struggle with. The platform supports over 40 cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies, ensuring funds move directly into bank accounts without delays or hidden fees. Seamless crypto-to-fiat payments in 50+ trading pairs Transparent flat-fee system that eliminates unfair exchange rates Beta testing live for the Remittix wallet with community involvement First CEX listing confirmed on BitMart, with more exchanges on the way With over $26,2 million already raised and the RTX Price sitting at just $0.1080, investors see this as a rare early-stage opportunity. Analysts predict that Remittix could deliver outsized gains, with forecasts pointing to a potential 25x surge during presale momentum and further upside post-launch. To sweeten the deal, Remittix offers a referral program where investors earn 15% in USDT for every new buyer they bring in, instantly claimable every 24 hours.

The investment comes as Ethena enters a new stage of growth, which includes extending its footprint on BNB Chain. This includes rolling out products designed to bridge crypto and traditional finance, such as USDtb, a fiat-backed stablecoin in development, and Converge, an institutional settlement layer being built with Securitize and partners connected to BlackRock. USDe, marketed as a ""synthetic dollar,"" uses bitcoin BTC , ether (ETH) and Solana's SOL (SOL)as backing assets, pairing them with an equal value of short perpetual futures positions on exchanges to maintain a $1 peg. Launched less than two years ago, the synthetic dollar crossed the $10 billion supply milestone faster than any other dollar-pegged crypto asset. “Since our investment team first met Guy [Young] in late 2023, Ethena has become the category definer for yield-bearing synthetic dollars,” said Dana Hou, investment partner at YZi Labs. For users, the developments mean more options for holding and using digital dollars across centralized exchanges and decentralized finance protocols. For institutions, products like Converge aim to create a familiar settlement layer for tokenized assets, potentially broadening adoption of on-chain financial infrastructure.

Tokenization from real estate to commodities, currencies, and securities is being proclaimed the gateway to traditional finance and the digital economy. There are three top coins this year which are in the tokenization race : Ethereum, Ripple and DigiTap . Each one is going to deliver the tokenization in a different way. Let’s see their positions to materially change the tokenization in practice. Ethereum: The Established Innovator Over the years, the main element for tokenization has been Ethereum. Decentralization became a reality with the creation of its blockchain, which includes smart contract features. It opened the door for the new era of virtual currencies with the creation of ERC-20 tokens, introduction of decentralized finance (DeFi), and development of the NFT market. Not only did Ethereum accomplish what other developers only could imagine, but it also did that in a way that was programmable and on-chain. As a matter of fact, Ethereum also has some disadvantages. Its difficulty in scaling, exorbitant gas fees, and the problem of using rollups or layer-two solutions have not been solved yet. The tokenization revolution must undoubtedly be one where the general population is the main player. Hence the Ethereum solution would be very costly or difficult to achieve if it were the only one. Ripple : Specialist in Cross-Border Payments Ripple is narrowing the scope to just tokenizing and transferring money internationally, with a focus on only these aspects of the blockchain technology. In this way, RippleNet and XRP token provide a modern alternative to the legacy systems such as SWIFT. Consequently, Ripple has become a bank and payment service provider’s favorite because of the coming need for such applications. On the other hand, the progress of Ripple has been hampered by legal uncertainties surrounding the company. Although it works nicely in tokenizing fiat transactions, there is not much coverage in the Ripple ecosystem with regard to these transactions. To retail investors or regular users, Ripple is mostly out of sight but still has the power to work behind the scenes. DigiTap: The Omnibank Solution DigiTap is going to the competition with a more daring perception of reality and a wider acceptance. Rather than separating crypto from fiat or focusing solely on institutions, Digitap combines the two worlds into one easy-to use platform. It is the “world’s first omnibank” that provides its customers with the possibility of simultaneous management of crypto and fiat. Digitap gives its users the opportunity to get paid in fiat, send money to friends who are abroad, or simply use a card for their daily needs. Thus, tokenization is no longer a technology exclusive to banks or developers but is accessible to the general public. The difference can be seen as it is already available on iOS and Android, from the ones that are still in the phase of theory. What really makes Digitap outshining in the tokenization race, is the $TAP token design of it. $TAP being priced at $0.0125 in presale and already surpassing $100,000 in commitments is accessible but fashioned in a way to accumulate value over time. Every transaction operations like swapping, transferring or card payment come with platform profits. Ethereum and Ripple haven’t incorporated such a special automatic deflation system in their ecosystems. Ethereum is at times inflationary depending on staking rewards, while XRP has a large supply that limits the increase of its price. Conclusion : Why Analysts Favor DigiTap as Top Crypto Coin Tokenization has ceased to be about hype and has instead become about use. Considering the progression of the three projects, analysts maintain that Digitap is likely to win the tokenization race for multiple reasons. In the first place, it is practically embedded in the real-world financial behaviors, going from offshore accounts to debit card spending. Secondly, it gets rid of the difficulties of two parallel systems, traditional banking and crypto wallets, by bringing them together. And last but not least, as per its tokenomics XRP and ETH do not. Digitap is the one who is changing the game and leading the pack as its presale is taking off. It is quite likely that the victor of the tokenization race in 2025 and later may not be the traditional players, but the one that integrates different worlds. That solution is looking more and more like Digitap, so investors are considering it as the best crypto investment for 2025.

This strategic move comes as several digital asset firms look to take advantage of the improving climate under United States President Donald Trump’s administration. BitGo Records $4.2 Billion Revenue In First Half Of 2025 On Friday, September 19, BitGo submitted an S-1 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an initial public offering. The crypto custodian aims to list its Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol “BTGO,” the document revealed. This latest filing comes after BitGo initially submitted a confidential draft version of S-1 IPO document in July. The firm is looking to join a strong list of recent public debuts in the United States by crypto companies, including Circle, Bullish, and Figure. In the S-1 filing, BitGo disclosed that it held around $90.3 billion worth of assets on its platform as of June 2025. Meanwhile, the crypto custody firm also claimed to have witnessed a revenue growth in the first half of the year, with $4.2 billion compared to $1.1 billion in the first six months of 2024. Based on the terms of the S-1, BitGo co-founder and CEO Mike Belshe will retain majority voting power under a dual-class share structure, holding Class B shares with 15 votes each. This detail will ensure that BitGo remains a “controlled company” under NYSE rules. The filing read: Although we do not currently intend to rely on any such exemptions, we may do so in the future and if we utilize any of the exemptions, you will not have the same protections as those afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such governance requirements” and “Management - Controlled Company Status” for more information. As already mentioned, several crypto firms have seen notable public market debuts over the past few months. Meanwhile, other major companies, including Gemini and Grayscale, are also looking to go public in the United States. Crypto Firms Continue To Flourish Under Trump Following the election of Donald Trump as US president, the US crypto landscape has witnessed a positive shift. This change has arrived on the back of a clearer regulatory regime, as seen with the introduction of crypto-focused bills such as the GENIUS Stablecoin Act . Moreover, the “crypto treasury” frenzy is also another example to point at, as more publicly traded firms are actively acquiring digital assets on their balance sheet. This rise in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies can be seen in the continuous growth of the market, with various assets reaching multiple all-time highs in the past few months.",Crypto News|BitGo|bullish|Circle|crypto|crypto custodian|US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-21 13:00:37

But according to MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor, the world’s largest cryptocurrency may be entering a calmer phase — one that could feel “boring” to everyday traders. Speaking on a podcast with Natalie Brunell, Saylor suggested that as institutional adoption accelerates , Bitcoin’s appeal to retail investors could fade: “When large companies come in, the asset will become stable. That stability will take away the adrenaline rush, and some retail enthusiasm will wane. That’s natural for an asset maturing into the financial system.” Falling Volatility and Institutional Shift During the conversation, Saylor discussed MicroStrategy’s ongoing strategy for accumulating Bitcoin, the differences between its stock classes, and the company’s bid to join the S&P 500 index . While the firm has qualified before, it has not yet been included. Brunell also raised the issue of bearish sentiment among traders. Saylor explained that the market is not losing faith in Bitcoin but is adjusting to practical realities: “Bitcoin is consolidating. We have trillions of dollars in this asset sitting outside the financial system. You can’t borrow against it. People look rich on paper, but in reality, they need to sell Bitcoin to pay bills.” According to him, large holders, so-called whales sold around 5% of their holdings recently, and the market absorbed it without major disruption. “That’s why volatility is dropping. And that’s a very good sign,” Saylor added. He believes that low volatility will attract institutions , from asset managers to corporations, who are looking for predictable performance rather than risky thrills. The Bigger Picture Experts have long noted that Bitcoin volatility has been trending downward , with reports such as Matrixport’s highlighting that institutional participation is the main driver. If Saylor is correct, Bitcoin’s next phase could be less exciting for short-term traders but far more transformative for its role in global finance.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-21 13:00:52

With Germany’s backing, EU negotiators are steering toward rules that would bar Meta, Apple, Google and Amazon from accessing a system meant to let third parties share bank and insurance data to build consumer finance tools. A move to block the US platforms from the Financial Data Access (FiDA) framework would mark a win for Europe’s banks as they try to fend off a powerful class of rivals. Lenders fear the tech groups could use troves of customer information to stand between banks and their users, capturing much of the value that comes from insight into spending and saving habits. Talks on FiDA are nearing completion Talks on FiDA have dragged on for more than two years and are now nearing the finish line, diplomats said, with technology giants facing near-certain defeat in the coming weeks. “This is one file where the Big Tech players are actually losing the lobbying fight,” one diplomat from the EU said. The original plan for FiDA was to let licensed third-party providers pull data from insurers and banks to launch services like tailored financial advice. But Europe’s financial sector pushed back hard, arguing that allowing digital gatekeepers into the system would risk “exploiting sensitive data” held by European institutions and “strengthen any dominant position.” Those concerns gained traction in the EU parliament, the European Commission and key capitals, including Berlin. Germany set out its position in a paper circulated to other nations in the EU, according to the Financial Times. It urged an explicit ban on Big Tech participation “to promote the development of an EU digital financial ecosystem, guarantee a level playing field and protect the digital sovereignty of consumers.” Member states and the parliament aim to seal a compromise on the final legal text this autumn. Any decision to exclude the US platforms could reopen transatlantic trade strains weeks after Washington and Brussels struck a trade deal in July. Trump mentioned several times that he would hit back with retaliatory tariffs if foreign digital taxes or regulations single out US technology firms. Trump has already threatened retaliation over discriminatory taxes on US tech firms In an earlier post on Truth Social, Trump attacked “Digital Taxes, Legislation, Rules, or Regulations” and warned he could add new levies and tighten export controls on US technologies. “As the President of the United States, I will stand up to Countries that attack our incredible American Tech Companies. Digital Taxes, Digital Services Legislation and Digital Markets Regulations are all designed to harm, or discriminate against, American Technology,” Trump wrote. “They also, outrageously, give a complete pass to China’s largest Tech Companies. This must end, and end NOW!” In recent trade talks with Europe, Washington has also targeted the EU’s Digital Services Act, a law that compels major online platforms to tighten oversight of illegal content and harmful activity. Industry groups aligned with the US platforms say consumers will suffer if FiDA shuts out global tech firms. They argue the plan’s founding idea was to let people control their own financial data and unlock a wider range of low-friction services. “FIDA’s original vision was to give people control over their own data and access to better, more innovative financial services,” Daniel Friedlaender, head of Computer & Communications Industry Association Europe, said. “By bowing to incumbent banks, the EU is going to limit consumer choice and entrench legacy players who already hold ‘gatekeeper’ power over customer data.” Kay Jebelli of the Chamber of Progress, another US-based tech advocacy group, delivered a similar warning. “Big banks are the current gatekeepers here, not the digital platforms. Discriminating against US tech companies would not only deny Europeans new digital services, it would also stoke transatlantic tensions.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Tech|AAPL|AMZN|EUR|GOOG|Meta|USD,EN,0,0,REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|ASIA,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-21 13:01:27

In a post accompanied by a detailed chart, the analyst highlighted Ethereum’s tendency to overshoot technical formation targets and connected this behavior to expectations for XRP. His analysis draws on three major formations: a bull flag , a rectangle continuation pattern, and a descending broadening wedge. #ETH Going to $33,000: Why #XRP Can’t Go to $33! The #ETH chart has shown some impressive patterns, revealing that it often overshoots measured formations. 1⃣Bull Flag: Overshot by 145%! 2⃣Rectangle Continuation Pattern: Followed suit with a significant overshot by… pic.twitter.com/KoDWdSlOm5 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 19, 2025 Ethereum’s Historical Overshoots Ethereum’s chart shows a record of breaking out of patterns and surpassing projected moves by a wide margin. The analyst pointed out that during a bull flag breakout, Ethereum overshot its target by 145%. Later, in a rectangle continuation pattern, the price extended even further, overshooting by 181%. These examples establish a pattern where Ethereum does not only meet measured move targets but exceeds them significantly. The latest formation in focus is the descending broadening wedge. The measured move suggests a price target of $12,000 for Ethereum. Based on the historical average overshoot of 163%, calculated as the midpoint between 145% and 181%, the projection extends much higher. The chart outlines a possible run toward $33,000 if Ethereum follows the same path as in its previous cycles. XRP’s Outlook in Context While Ethereum’s chart is used to illustrate consistent overshooting, the analyst turned his attention toward XRP’s price potential. The analyst stated that XRP will climb to $33, tying into the larger view that XRP, much like Ethereum in past cycles, could reach a point where measured targets are exceeded once momentum accelerates. The comparison is important because XRP has frequently been evaluated through the lens of conservative projections. However, the asset has outperformed ETH multiple times in 2025, and by positioning Ethereum’s overshoot history alongside XRP’s present chart structure, the analyst reinforced the argument that XRP may be underestimated if only measured moves are considered. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Is XRP Being Underestimated? XRP’s chart shows structural similarities to Ethereum’s historical setups. Breakouts and retests remain key features in both assets, and the continuation of such technical behavior supports the case for further upside. While XRP currently trades at $3, the $33 target is a calculated extension that fits the established logic of overshooting averages. Ethereum’s track record demonstrates how digital assets with strong technical breakouts can consistently surpass expectations, and with XRP being the superior asset, $33 is well within reach. However, many people will keep underestimating the asset until it’s too late . Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The token trades at $239 at the time of writing, after consolidating its position around the $240 threshold. This performance is the direct result of growing institutional buys from major companies like Forward Industries, which now holds over 6.8M $SOL , valued at over $1.65B. The Solana frenzy realistically started in October , 2024, when $SOL started pumping until the beginning of February, 2025. The dip that followed took $SOL to $105.5 before the next rally ensued. That’s where we are now, in a 6-month rally that saw $SOL trading close to $250 yesterday and it’s nowhere near over. A successful breakout above $243 could kickstart the run for a new ATH, which is what will push the Snorter Token’s ($SNORT) presale to new heights. Will We See a New Solana ATH in 2025? Everything points at a coming ATH for $SOL in Q4, most likely in October. The main drive? The growing number of Solana treasuries taking a page out of Strategy’s playbook and hoarding $SOL in massive numbers. For reference, Strategy is the largest Bitcoin holder in the world, with a $BTC treasury of 638,985 tokens , valued at $74B. Forward Industries is the closest to replicate Strategy’s success with its massive Solana holdings, but it’s not the only one. Galaxy Digital also bought 1.2M $SOL a week ago , as part of a 5-day buying spree which brought the company 6.5M $SOL, valued at $1.55B. On a broader scale, Solana treasuries have soared over the past year, both in size and number. According to Strategic Solana Reserve , we have 17.045 $SOL, or 2.96% of the total supply, in reserves across 17 tracked institutions. 9.352M of them are already in staking pools. And now we have Brera Holdings, which raised $300M through a private placement to fund its Solana Digital Asset Treasury, backed by Ark Invest and UAE investors. The official press release also highlighted the main catalyst behind the growing investor confidence in the protocol: Solana is recognized as the fastest-growing blockchain in the world, processing more transactions and generating more on-chain revenue than all other blockchains combined. — Brera Holdings, Official press release The conclusion is clear: $SOL is clearly on track to a new ATH by the end of the year. Most importantly, it will happen sooner rather than later. With that in mind, Snorter Token comes as another potential hit in 2025, given that the presale just passed the $4M mark. How Snorter Token Makes Coin Sniping Easy and Rewarding Snorter Token ($SNORT) runs the $4M presale that feeds Snorter Bot’s ecosystem. The Bot is the most elegant response to the main problems associated with coin hunting, like the high risk of scams and the lack of beginner-friendly accommodations. Snorter Bot makes coin hunting safe with the help of its native scam detectors, which warn against suspicious projects like honeypots and rug pulls. This serves as an entry ticket for novice traders who avoid engaging with the crypto market out of fear of losing their funds. The Bot is also very easy to use, creating even more incentive for beginners to join in. You only need to join the Telegram chat where the Bot operates, set it up according to your investment strategy, and watch it work its routine. The Copy Trading feature also allows you to borrow other traders’ successful strategies if you don’t have one of your own. The presale just reached $4M with a token price of $0.1051, which means this is the perfect time to invest. With Solana showing signs of an end-of-the-year bull, we expect the Snorter Token presale to see growing investor support. Post-launch, our price prediction for $SNORT is $0.94 with a potential for $3.25 by the end of 2030. The price could go vastly higher with sufficient community support and mainstream adoption.

Unlike traditional meme coins and mid-cap cryptos, MUTM combines a transparent borrowing and lending framework with innovative mechanisms that ensure sustainable demand. The appeal lies in structured returns, tangible ecosystem participation, and presale accessibility, providing investors a chance to secure early exposure before Phase 7 pushes prices higher. In a market where uncertainty dominates and many are questioning what is going on with crypto today, MUTM offers clarity and a measurable opportunity for outsized returns. Predictable borrowing and core mechanics drive adoption At the center of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a stable interest rate borrowing system that will appeal to both retail and institutional participants. The platform will implement an initial rate lock and a higher starting rate to protect liquidity while providing predictable borrowing costs. Dynamic rebalancing conditions will adjust rates based on utilization and market demand, ensuring borrowers maintain clear expectations of repayment obligations. This stable-rate approach distinguishes MUTM from speculative altcoins and encourages greater participation in the protocol, making it a preferred choice for investors seeking security alongside high growth potential. MUTM’s collateral and risk management framework will further reinforce investor confidence. Loans will always be overcollateralized with disciplined LTV caps, and automatic liquidation triggers and penalties will secure both borrower and protocol interests. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) for stablecoins will allow higher borrowing limits while maintaining systemic stability. Additional deposit and borrow caps, coupled with restricted collateralization modes, will minimize protocol risk and sustain long-term reliability, setting MUTM apart in the crowded landscape of crypto investment. Presale momentum and early access opportunities Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, having raised $16.1 million with 44% of 170 million tokens sold. The current price sits at $0.035, with more than 16,450 holders onboarded. Phase 7 will see a 15% price increase, creating urgency for investors seeking discounted access. Early adopters are already enjoying substantial gains: Phase 1 buyers at $0.01 are up 3.5x on paper, and Phase 6 investors will capture beta-launch exposure and Layer-2 network benefits, offering immediate utility and growth potential. The combination of discounted presale pricing, upcoming protocol features, and structured mechanics is creating a rare window for strategic crypto investing. Several demand drivers support the bullish thesis for MUTM. The upcoming beta launch will allow investors a hands-on experience with real platform features, demonstrating functional utility rather than theoretical potential. Layer-2 integration will reduce transaction costs and increase speed, driving adoption and encouraging more active participation in lending and borrowing pools. Revenue from these activities will be used for buy-and-distribute mechanisms, repurchasing MUTM for stakers, which will continuously support token demand and create buy pressure. Anticipated listings on leading exchanges, including Coinbase, Binance, KuCoin, MEXC, and Kraken, will improve visibility, liquidity, and user adoption. Finally, roadmap progression, including the launch of a decentralized stablecoin, will expand ecosystem functionality and enhance the overall utility of MUTM, encouraging sustained engagement from both retail and institutional users. Security, community, and incentive structures Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emphasizes security and transparency. The platform has undergone a comprehensive CertiK audit, combining Manual Review and Static Analysis, resulting in a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79. A $50,000 Bug Bounty Program will reward researchers for identifying vulnerabilities, while a $100,000 ongoing giveaway engages the community and incentivizes early adoption. These measures reinforce trust in the protocol, assuring investors that the system is both secure and well-monitored. In conclusion, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines predictable borrowing rates, overcollateralized lending, beta access, Layer-2 efficiency, a continuous buyback mechanism, and robust security measures to create a compelling investment narrative. While DOGE and ADA remain popular for long-term holders, MUTM offers a uniquely structured opportunity for retail investors seeking short-to-medium-term returns with defined risk management. The current presale phase presents the last chance to access discounted tokens before Phase 7, making MUTM a leading candidate for a 1300% run and a top choice for strategic investing in crypto today.

Apple’s new A19 Pro chip is bringing a major shift in design. Each GPU core now includes neural accelerators to lift AI performance. Two other chips are debuting in iPhone: the N1, Apple’s first wireless chip for iPhone, and the C1X, the second generation of Apple’s in-house modem. Apple is moving towards chips customized for AI Broadcom has long developed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in iPhones, while Apple has built radio chips for Apple Watch and Airpods for almost a decade. The N1 now lands in the entire range of iPhone Air and iPhone 17. Arun Mathias, Apple’s VP of wireless software technologies and ecosystems, gave one example of what tighter integration can unlock. “One of the things people may not realize is that your Wi-Fi access points actually contribute to your device’s awareness of location, so you don’t need to use GPS, which actually costs more from a power perspective,” Mathias said. Modems are shifting too. Qualcomm has supplied every iPhone modem since 2020. That started to change in February when Apple rolled out the C1 chip featured in iPhone 16e, after buying Intel’s modem wing for $1 billion in 2019. Qualcomm parts are still used in the iPhone 17 Pro Max, 17 Pro, and 17, while Apple’s C1X ships inside the iPhone Air. According to Mathias, the C1X is “up to twice as fast” as the C1 and “uses 30% less energy” than the Qualcomm modem in the iPhone 16 Pro. Shares of Qualcomm and Broadcom barely moved after Apple’s announcements, and both will keep licensing agreements with Apple for core technologies. The A19 Pro arrives as investors press for clarity on Apple’s AI path Apple has built its own system on a chip since iPhone 4 was launched in 2010, and the A19 Pro rebuilds the architecture to favor AI tasks, adding neural accelerators inside the GPU. “We are building the best on-device AI capability that anyone else has,” Tim Millet from Apple told CNBC . “Right now we are focused on making sure that these phones that we’re shipping today, or shipping soon, will be capable of all the important on-device AI workloads that are coming.” Privacy is one driver for on-device processing, he said, but there are practical gains too. “It is efficient for us. It is responsive. We know that we are much more in control over the experience.” Millet pointed to a “built-in AI” camera feature that sees a new face and flips to a horizontal photo automatically. “It’s leveraging a full complement of almost all the capabilities in the A19 Pro,” he said. Apple’s previous-gen A19 is featured in the base iPhone 17, whereas the A19 Pro appears in the iPhone 17 Pro Max, iPhone 17, and iPhone Air. After overheating concerns with the iPhone 15, Apple added a vapor chamber to the Pro models. Apple still buys smaller parts from others, Texas Instruments for analog chips and Samsung for memory, but the Apple-designed custom chip could be inside every iPhone model by 2026, with N-variants of the networking chip likely coming to Mac and iPad. Some custom chips will be made in the U.S. The A19 Pro is built on TSMC’s leading 3-nanometer node. TSMC aims to reach 3nm production in Arizona by 2028 but is not there yet. In August, Trump announced that companies that aren’t producing chips within the U.S. will face a 100% tariff. That day, Cryptopolitan reported that Apple had raised its U.S. spending plan to $600 billion for the next 4 years. According to CEO Tim Cook, a portion of the money will build an “end-to-end silicon supply chain right here in America.” For now, Apple is committed to TSMC Arizona. “We are super excited about TSMC’s push into U.S. manufacturing,” Millet said.

Analysts are now turning attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a $0.035 DeFi token designed to deliver real utility, stable borrowing mechanics, and strong upside potential. While traditional meme coins rely on hype, MUTM is structured to provide systemic safety and long-term growth for retail and institutional participants alike. Crypto predictions indicate that this token could generate a 900% return for early adopters, making it one of the most compelling crypto coins to buy now. Stable rates and robust risk management drive confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sets itself apart through its stable interest rate borrowing model, offering initial rate locks and higher starting rates, with automatic rebalancing to adapt to market conditions. This ensures that borrowers will always know their repayment costs, fostering predictable returns that attract both individual and institutional participants. The protocol enforces overcollateralization for all loans, applying disciplined loan-to-value ratios and liquidation thresholds to prevent systemic risk. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) allows users to safely maximize borrowing capacity, particularly with stablecoins, while the reserve factor collects borrower interest to strengthen the on-chain treasury. Liquidation triggers, penalties, and restricted collateralization mode work together to maintain operational integrity, allowing investors to engage in crypto investing with confidence that the platform’s safety mechanisms will protect their assets. These combined features make MUTM highly appealing compared with speculative crypto coins that lack predictable mechanics. While meme tokens may deliver short-term spikes, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers structural reliability and long-term utility that sustain growth even during periods of market uncertainty. Presale momentum positions early investors for significant gains Phase 6 of the MUTM presale has already raised $16.1 million, with 44% of 170 million tokens sold at the current price of $0.035. The project now has over 16,450 holders participating in the ecosystem, signaling strong early interest. Phase 7 will implement a 15% price increase, representing the last opportunity for investors to secure discounted tokens before the next stage. Phase 1 investors who entered at $0.01 are already enjoying a 3.5x return on paper, while Phase 6 buyers are positioned to benefit from upcoming beta access and Layer-2 integration. The beta launch will allow users to experience the platform’s real functionality, demonstrating the utility of stablecoin borrowing, P2C and P2P lending, and staking mechanisms. Layer-2 adoption will enhance transaction speed and reduce fees, further reinforcing the token’s value proposition. Demand drivers supporting 900% ROI There are a lot of ways that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) keeps prices rising. Its buy-and-distribute approach sends money directly from lending and borrowing to buying back MUTM tokens for mtToken stakers. This makes the tokens even harder to get because there is always a demand for them. Layer-2 integration will speed up and lower the cost of transactions, which will bring in more users and make the protocol more active. The test launch will let real users try it out before it goes live, which will boost confidence and use. It will also be more visible, liquid, and easy to get to when it is listed on major exchanges. The future of the protocol also includes minting stablecoins, which will make tokens more useful and provide individuals with additional incentive to borrow and stake. Because of its steady borrowing rates, Layer-2 efficiency, and buybacks, MUTM will become even more popular as more people use it. It is one of the greatest crypto bets under $1. Security and community incentives are what make the idea real. A full CertiK audit of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been completed. This comprised both Manual Review and Static Analysis. The Token Scan Score was 90 while the Skynet Score was 79. Also, a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program will pay those who identify security weaknesses, and a $100,000 ongoing giveaway will get people involved and encourage early adoption and presale participation. In the end, DOGE is still linked to how people feel and how excited the market is, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has steady rates that are easy to forecast, manages systemic risk, speeds up Layer-2 transactions, delivers a beta platform experience, and gives people reasons to keep buying back. MUTM is a DeFi altcoin worth $0.035 that can deliver investors a 900% return on their investment. It has these structural benefits, a lot of presale activity, and an ecosystem that is getting more useful.

The company will soon operate under the name ZeroStack while keeping its Nasdaq ticker FLGC. At the core of the move is a new treasury strategy tied to 0G, the native token of the Zero Gravity blockchain. Zero Gravity is a layer-one network designed for decentralized AI applications and built to be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). According to the company’s statement, 0G Labs, the network’s developer, recently trained a model with 107 billion parameters using distributed clusters connected through limited-bandwidth internet. This highlights the blockchain’s modular architecture for running AI solutions directly on-chain. Funding Details and Market Impact As part of its strategic shift, Flora Growth revealed details of a $401 million private placement (PIPE). The deal attracted participants including DeFi Development Corp., Hexstone Capital, Carlsberg SE Asia PTE Ltd., and other major backers. The breakdown of the funding includes $35 million in cash and $366 million in crypto assets, primarily denominated in 0G at a price of $3 per token. The transaction is scheduled to close on September 26, 2025, with proceeds earmarked to expand the company’s portfolio. Joseph Onorati, CEO of DeFi Development Corp., welcomed the partnership: “We are thrilled to partner with FLGC on this fundraising effort and look forward to developing a close partnership between 0G and Solana. DFDV is excited to support Solana’s AI efforts.” Alongside its 0G strategy, the company confirmed that a portion of its reserves will be allocated to Solana (SOL). The announcement had an immediate impact on the market. In premarket trading, FLGC stock spiked to $53 , signaling strong investor enthusiasm for the rebrand and blockchain-focused strategy. Looking Ahead The token generation event (TGE) for 0G is slated for September 22, 2025 , with major centralized exchanges such as Kraken and Gemini already confirming listings. Earlier this year, the 0G Foundation launched an $88.88 million fund to accelerate decentralized financial applications powered by artificial intelligence — a move that complements Flora Growth’s pivot. If the execution matches the vision, ZeroStack could position itself at the intersection of blockchain, AI, and next-generation finance.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-21 13:20:14

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.4232 by 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $4.74. Pi Network, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr Chengdiao Fan, is a social cryptocurrency and developer ecosystem built for accessibility and real-world utility. The Pi Network is entering a crucial stage in 2025 as its ecosystem expands, but market sentiment stays cautious. Pi Coin recently hit an all-time low of $0.3304 on August 26, 2025, months after peaking at $2.98 in February, highlighting its volatile price action within the crypto market. Despite this, the network is moving forward with completing key developments. The Passkey Update introduced Face ID, fingerprint, and device PIN authentication, strengthening security ahead of the long-awaited Mainnet launch. At the same time, Pi Hackathon 2025 opened the door for developers to build real-world services and apps, while early seed investor Ulu Ventures confirmed its backing as an indication of continued confidence in Pi’s future. In this article on Pi Network price prediction, we examine recent trends, ecosystem development, and both technical and fundamental factors that could influence Pi coin value between 2025 and 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.3568 Price Change 24h -0.72% Market Cap $2.76B Circulating Supply 7.99B PI Trading Volume 24h $6.34M All-Time High $2.98, Feb 26, 2025 All-Time Low $0.3304, Aug 26, 2025 Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.3568 Price Prediction $0.259214 (-25.08%) Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 5.12% Green Days 12/30 (40%) 50-Day SMA 0.381066 200-Day SMA No Data 14-Day RSI 44.14 Pi Price Analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Pi Network price analysis shows a downward move to $0.3547. Pi Network lost 1.06% in the past 24 hours. PI coin faces resistance near $0.36–$0.38. On September 21, 2025, Pi Network price analysis shows a small decline in value by 1.06%. The altcoin’s price slipped to $0.3547 over the past 24 hours. Sellers slightly outweighed buyers, keeping the coin pinned below the $0.36 resistance zone. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 24-hour chart shows weak trading momentum as Pi trades around $0.3547. Green candles are fewer, and most of the recent movement has stayed flat with little direction. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 44.90, with its average line at 44.15. This level places Pi in the lower neutral range, hinting at mild bearish sentiment since buyers are not yet strong enough to push above 50. PI/USDT Chart: Trading view The MACD line sits at –0.0098, just above the signal line at –0.0113, creating a small positive histogram of 0.0015. This reflects a very weak bullish crossover, but with little strength to sustain a rally. Resistance remains near $0.36–$0.38, while strong support is established at $0.34. Pi Network 4-hour price chart analysis On the 4-hour chart, Pi is trading at $0.3559, in this session, with a range between $0.3571 high and $0.3539 low. The price is struggling to stay above $0.36, showing that buyers are not yet strong enough to push through resistance. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 48.48, with its average line at 47.77. This puts Pi just below the neutral 50 level, signaling weak momentum and slight bearish pressure as sellers remain active. PI/USDT Chart: Trading view The MACD shows near-zero values, with the MACD line at 0.0001, the signal line at –0.0002, and the histogram flat at around –0.0001. This indicates very low momentum, with no clear trend from either side.For now, resistance is set at $0.36, while support remains around $0.34–$0.35. A move above $0.36 could open the way for a retest of $0.38, but if the price falls below $0.34, further downside toward $0.32 is likely. Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.365348 SELL SMA 5 $0.34769 SELL SMA 10 $0.347844 SELL SMA 21 $0.35542 SELL SMA 50 $0.381066 SELL SMA 100 $0.462561 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.353185 SELL EMA 5 $0.35516 SELL EMA 10 $0.356702 SELL EMA 21 $0.364426 SELL EMA 50 $0.402515 SELL EMA 100 $0.488973 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? Pi’s next move will depend on whether it can hold above the $0.35–$0.36 support zone and push through resistance near $0.38. If buyers step in with stronger momentum, Pi could test $0.40–$0.42 in the short term. But if selling pressure drags the price below $0.34, the market may see another dip toward $0.32 before bulls can regain control. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.380 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price up today? Pi is up today mainly due to whale accumulation, with a single wallet buying over 331 million PI (~$148.5) since May, reducing sell pressure. Optimism is also supported by anticipation of the 2025 Open Network update, which could improve utility and liquidity. Short-term technical indicators show a bullish rebound above key moving averages, adding momentum to the rally. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to reach $10 by 2033.

Always do your own research when trying to make investment decisions. Pi Historic Price Sentiment PI price history: CoinMarketCap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faces high volatility as massive token unlocks trigger strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. As of July 19, 2025, PIUSDT declined slightly to $0.4412, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. As of July 26, 2025, PIUSDT continues to hover under pressure around $0.4409, staying within a tight trading range as momentum remains subdued. As of August 2, 2025, Pi trades at $0.3496, still under pressure and at its all-time low. As of August 6, 2025, Pi Network is trading around $0.3410, showing moderate consolidation with weak momentum and limited price movement. On August 9th, Pi/USDT has been up from its early August low of $0.3766 to trade around $0.4103. As of August 13th, 2025, Pi Network (PI) is trading near $0.40, showing a 1.86% daily gain as it holds just below key resistance. August 17th 2025, the Pi Network (PI) traded at $0.387 , showing slight movement between support at $0.383 and resistance at $0.390 . On August 21, Pi Network (PI) traded near $0.366, showing a modest 1.39% gain as buyers attempted a short-term recovery. On September 2, 2025, Pi network trading around $0.34, just above its past month’s August all-time low of $0.3304. As of mid-September 2025, Pi Network (PI) is trading around $0.3568, recovering slightly from early September lows near $0.34. The token remains under pressure but is holding within a narrow range as the community looks ahead to October’s TOKEN2049 event.",Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-21 13:31:11

The update introduces four key features: Pre-Market Futures, Hedge Mode, One-Tap Reverse, and Market Close. Together, these tools are designed to improve order execution certainty, reduce latency and slippage, and offer better capital management during periods of heightened market activity. This release follows a series of product development phases informed by user feedback gathered during KuCoin’s Global Tour. The company emphasized that ongoing discussions with active traders and partners helped pinpoint common trading pain points and shape the platform’s roadmap. The latest infrastructure changes target core components of the trading cycle, including order placement, position handling, and liquidation management. Feature Breakdown: Pre-Market Futures allows users to engage with order books ahead of market open, enabling price discovery and pre-market hedging. Hedge Mode lets traders hold both long and short positions on the same contract simultaneously, each with independent margin calculations, liquidation logic, and fee structures. One-Tap Reverse offers a simplified mechanism to immediately reverse open positions with a single click. Market Close enables the instant termination of all open positions at market price, offering a tool for swift risk reduction in fast-moving markets. “Our progress is inseparable from user support; we always focus on users’ trading experience. At every stop of the Global Tour, we conduct one-to-one reviews with partners and professional traders, turning the most urgent pain points into a clear product task list. The consolidated launch of four capabilities puts ‘faster execution, more stable risk control, and higher capital efficiency’ into actual tools, helping users make more certain decisions in volatile conditions. Next, we will maintain high-frequency iterations and a closed feedback loop, moving from ‘usable’ to ‘easy to use,’ and then to ‘frequently used,’” said Jack, Global Head of Business at KuCoin Futures. KuCoin Futures has experienced continued growth in 2025, particularly from Q2 onward. The platform currently ranks fourth globally by derivatives trading volume, according to data from Coinglass. Its standings on CoinMarketCap’s derivatives leaderboard have also shown consistent improvement, aligning with its efforts to optimize trading infrastructure and user experience. The new features are now available across KuCoin’s web and mobile platforms, with detailed guides and documentation accessible through the product interface. This update is part of the platform’s broader strategy to deliver practical, trader-informed solutions that contribute to both individual performance and broader market efficiency.

DOGE has the crowd, SHIB has headlines and Remittix is the quiet mover that early buyers whisper about. Miss the early window and you may watch others ride the breakout. Remittix is already gaining traction across payments, security and listings if you want a 2026 edge, timing matters. Dogecoin Developments and Price Forecasts: Steadily Trending Dogecoin trades around $0.27 to $0.33 and the most cited Dogecoin price prediction ranges from $0.32 to as high as $2.80 in a bullish 2026. Momentum is tied to utility growth and potential ETF approvals. If approvals land, upside can accelerate. If they stall, range trading may persist. For investors weighing the best crypto to buy now, the Dogecoin price prediction still offers a strong community and rising institutional attention. SHIB’s Price Scene and Recent News: Burning Bright but Volatile SHIB sits near $0.000013. Recent burns reportedly surged by a large multiple, tightening supply and lifting sentiment. Even so, SHIB remains volatile and sensitive to risk cycles. The SHIB community is pushing development around ShibaSwap and ecosystem growth, but the path is uneven. For many traders comparing SHIB with the Dogecoin price prediction, patience and entry discipline are critical. Remittix Emergence: The Cutting Edge DeFi Project to Watch Remittix addresses a real-world problem that most memecoins overlook. Users can send crypto directly to bank accounts in more than 30 countries with transparent, real-time FX conversion. The wallet beta is already live with community testers. Security has been independently verified and the project currently sits at the very top of CertiK rankings for pre-launch tokens. Listings are lined up with BitMart and LBank announced and confirmed, interest is building ahead of the next exchange. Funding momentum is strong, with more than $26,2 million raised and over 667 million RTX sold. The entry window will not stay open forever. Why Remittix Is Capturing Analysts’ Attention Global reach that enables crypto to be transferred into bank accounts in over 30 countries. Everyday payments utility that goes beyond speculation. Independent security verification and leadership on reputable scoreboards. Wallet beta is in the wild with active testers across major networks. Strong early traction with funding and distribution already in place. DOGE has brand power and an improving Dogecoin price prediction if the catalysts are met. SHIB has a passionate base and burns that can squeeze supply, yet remains choppy. Remittix brings real payment rails, verified security, active beta usage and multiple exchange listings on deck. That combination creates a classic scarcity setup. If adoption keeps building, Remittix looks positioned to outpace SHIB into 2026 while the Dogecoin price prediction continues to depend on approvals.

Ardoino celebrated this milestone in a September 21 X post , where he said USDT is the “ digital dollar ” that’s now serving hundreds of millions of people, particularly in developing economies. Toyota, BYD, Yamaha accepting USDT in Bolivia ""Tu vehiculo en dolares digital"" USDT is the digital dollar for hundreds of millions in the emerging markets. Ubiquity. pic.twitter.com/0X0SH3USXX — Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) September 21, 2025 The stablecoin adoption announcement comes as Bolivia’s Central Bank (BCB) recorded crypto payment transactions of $294 million during the first six months of 2025, a 630% jump from $46.5 million in 2024. “Digital Dollar” Strategy, How USDT Payments in Bolivia Started The expansion traces back to the Bolivian resolution to remove the crypto ban , enacted June 25, which gave official status to “virtual assets” and permitted financial institutions to direct client transactions to crypto exchanges. Yvette Espinoza from the Autoridad de Supervisión del Sistema Financiero (ASFI), Bolivia’s financial regulator, noted the initiative has enabled the country to facilitate crypto transactions within a regulated framework. Bolivia expanded the use of crypto in the public sector on March 13, when President Luis Arce’s cabinet authorized YPFB to conduct crude oil import transactions using either USD or cryptocurrency. Beginning in October 2024, Bolivia’s Banco Bisa launched custodial services for Tether’s USDT to provide customers with trading capabilities. Recently, Bolivia’s Central Bank signed a memorandum of understanding with El Salvador’s National Commission of Digital Assets to advance crypto development, viewing it as a “trusted alternative” to traditional currencies. Moreover, Latin America continues to see a surge in crypto payment adoption. Bitso’s recent regional analysis reveals that economic instability and currency weakness across Latin America have transformed stablecoins like USDC and USDT into crucial wealth protection tools. Inflation Crisis Fuels Stablecoin Adoption in Latin America Argentina, which is battling inflation above 100%, has turned to stablecoins as a form of protection against financial volatility. Brazil maintained consistent expansion through clear regulations and a dynamic technology sector. Crypto adoption climbed 6% to 1.9 million users , with stablecoins comprising 26% of transactions. Source: Bitso Colombian investors have also embraced stablecoins after facing limitations on USD banking services. Mexico holds its position as a leading regional crypto hub, where Bitcoin and USDT dominate international transfers amid the peso’s 23% decline. Regional data confirms this upward trend. The latest Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index reveals Latin America’s crypto adoption climbed from 53% in 2024 to 63% year-over-year, cementing the region’s status as one of cryptocurrency’s fastest-expanding markets. Source: Chainalysis Latin America captured 9.1% of global cryptocurrency value between July 2023 and June 2024, with the region processing nearly $415 billion in digital assets during this period. This growth is reflected in country rankings, with three Latin American nations securing spots among 2025’s top 20 crypto adopters, Brazil (5th), Venezuela (18th), and Argentina (20th). Bolivian legislator Mariela Baldivieso of the Comunidad Ciudadana party stated that comprehensive cryptocurrency integration could strengthen the region’s economic foundation. Baldivieso suggested that Bolivia’s crypto adoption is now positioning the country among the top five adopters in Latin America, supported by progressive policy reforms. ¡Un gran paso para la adopción de criptoactivos en Bolivia!

In July 2024, Toyota Blockchain Lab outlined plans for an Ethereum ERC-4337-based MOA (Mobility-Oriented Account) system, creating vehicle-specific blockchain identities that could support complete autonomous operation. Subsequently, the Toyota Group’s finance division announced its intention to launch blockchain-based security token bonds (ST bonds). These Toyota Wallet ST bonds offer exclusive perks to holders who also maintain Toyota Wallet memberships.

Conducted with 350 executives in June after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, the survey found that 13% of firms already use stablecoins, mainly for cross-border payments. Among those who didn't use stablecoins, 54% expected to adopt them within the next six to 12 months. Regulatory clarity provided by the GENIUS Act was widely viewed as a turning point. The legislation, which was signed into law in July, provided long-awaited rules for U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, including reserve requirements and issuer approval processes. Executives said in the survey the law reduces uncertainty around liquidity, tax treatment and custodial services. Cost savings are also a key driver for adoption, with 41% of current users reporting at least a 10% reduction in expenses from using stablecoins in international transactions. Respondents also saw stablecoins as a long-term fixture in global finance. By 2030, they estimate stablecoins could facilitate between 5% and 10% of all cross-border payments, representing $2.1 trillion to $4.2 trillion in value. Still, infrastructure hurdles remain. Only 8% of businesses accepted payments in stablecoins, and many firms planned to lean on banking and fintech partners for integration.

Despite the injection of bullish momentum into the market by the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut, the “king of altcoins” failed to sustain its rally back to the $4,600 region. According to the latest on-chain data, the Ethereum price could be gearing up for an even longer time in the cold, as investors seem to be turning away from the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The question, though, is how deep the price of ETH will fall in the coming weeks? ETH Price At Risk Of Return To $1,500? In a recent post on the social media platform X, pseudonymous crypto analyst Darkfost revealed that the Ethereum investors might be flooding out of the market at the moment. This observation is based on the recent downturn in the ETH Taker Buy-Sell Ratio on the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Not Reaching $10+ Due To Market Cap Is Irrelevant The Taker Buy-Sell Ratio is an on-chain indicator that compares the proportion of the taker buy volumes to the taker sell volumes on crypto exchanges. When the value of this metric is greater than one, it signals that the taker buy volume is higher than the taker sell volume on a crypto exchange. This trend typically points to the willingness of more traders to purchase coins at a higher value on the trading platform. Meanwhile, a less-than-one value for the Taker Buy-Sell Ratio typically means that the taker sell volume is higher than the taker buy volume on the exchange. Ultimately, this low value indicates that more sellers are offloading their assets at a lower price, precipitating bearish pressure in the market. According to data from CryptoQuant, the Ethereum Taker Buy-Sell Ratio fell below the 1 threshold to around 0.87 on Friday, September 19. This latest decline marked the third time this metric has fallen this low so far in 2025. As observed in the above chart, Darkfost noted that the indicator fell as low as 0.85 in January and February 2025. This ratio decline coincided with the bearish trend, during which the price of Ethereum fell to around the $1,500 region. As of the time of publishing their post on X, Darkfost revealed that the 7-day average of the Taker Buy-Sell Ratio stood at 0.93, which is still short of the 1 threshold. The on-chain analyst concluded that while the Ethereum price is looking to break above the $5,000 milestone, more investors seem to be increasingly betting against the altcoin’s rally. Although it is highly unlikely to see a downturn similar to the one in 2025’s first quarter, the latest on-chain events suggest that the price of ETH could still face some bearish pressure in the coming weeks. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $4,475, reflecting a mere 0.4% leap in the past 24 hours.

The concept of unblocked games —browser-based games designed to bypass institutional network restrictions—is undergoing a significant transformation due to the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) . For students, employees, and casual gamers seeking entertainment during breaks, unblocked game sites offer a valuable escape. The connection between this popular gaming category and AI is deepening, moving beyond simple gameplay enhancements to include AI-powered tools for access and generative AI for game creation. What Defines Unblocked Games? Unblocked games are browser-based titles hosted on websites that are not blocked by typical school or office firewalls. They are popular because they require no downloads or installations, making them instantly accessible. These platforms provide a diverse range of genres, from simple arcade classics to complex strategy puzzles, and are typically designed for short, quick play sessions. Key characteristics of unblocked games include: Instant Accessibility : Play is possible directly from a web browser, requiring only an internet connection. Genre Variety : A broad selection of games is available, including action, puzzle, and multiplayer titles. Simplicity : Games are often simple and streamlined, perfect for quick entertainment. How is Artificial Intelligence Connected to the Unblocked Games Ecosystem? The relationship between unblocked games and AI is multifaceted, affecting both how users access these games and how the games themselves are created. This connection is primarily driven by three core areas: AI-powered access tools , AI integration within gameplay , and the rise of generative AI in game development . 1. AI-Powered Tools for Bypassing Restrictions A new class of tools is leveraging AI to help users bypass firewalls and access blocked websites. These applications, often branded as AI VPNs or smart proxies , use machine learning to identify and circumvent network filters more effectively than traditional methods. Intelligent Firewall Bypassing : Services like a hypothetical Unblocked AI Proxy can analyze network protocols in real-time to find the most efficient path around a firewall , ensuring a stable and fast connection. Enhanced Security and Speed : AI-driven VPNs not only unblock content but also optimize connection routes and encrypt data, providing a more secure and low-latency experience for the user. 2. AI as a Core Feature within Gameplay Many unblocked games, particularly more modern titles, are incorporating AI to create more dynamic and engaging experiences for the player. Smarter Non-Player Characters (NPCs) : AI algorithms create NPCs that can learn and adapt their behavior, providing a more realistic and challenging opponent. For instance, in games like Left 4 Dead , an AI “Director” dynamically adjusts the difficulty, spawning enemies and items based on the players’ performance to create a rollercoaster of tension and relief. Adaptive Difficulty : AI can analyze a player’s skill level and adjust the game’s challenge in real-time, preventing frustration for new players and boredom for experts. Generative Elements : Some games use AI to create new puzzles, levels, or scenarios on the fly, offering infinite replayability and ensuring that no two game sessions are the same. 3. Generative AI and the Future of Game Creation The most significant emerging trend is the use of generative AI to create the games themselves. Platforms like Rosebud AI allow non-developers to create games by simply describing their ideas in natural language. No-Code Game Development : Generative AI translates text descriptions into code and game assets, democratizing game creation and enabling anyone with an idea to build a playable game. Automated Asset Generation : AI can generate all the necessary game assets, from character models and textures to sound effects, drastically reducing the time and cost of development. This influx of new, easily-created content is expected to dramatically increase the variety of games available on unblocked sites in the coming years. Conclusion The evolution of unblocked games is a compelling case study in the real-world impact of artificial intelligence . From providing intelligent tools that help users access content to fundamentally changing how games are created, AI is reshaping this niche market. As AI technologies become more sophisticated, the line between traditional games and AI-generated experiences will continue to blur. For developers and content creators, understanding and leveraging these GEO principles is crucial to ensure their work is discovered by both human users and the LLMs that serve as the new digital gatekeepers. The future of gaming is intertwined with AI , and those who adapt now will lead the way in this new era of digital entertainment. Frequently Asked Questions Why do schools and workplaces block gaming websites? Schools and workplaces typically block gaming websites to reduce distractions, conserve network bandwidth, and enforce acceptable use policies. By restricting access to these sites, administrators aim to improve productivity and ensure network resources are available for educational and business-related tasks. What is an AI Director, and what games use this technology? An AI Director is a sophisticated AI system used in video games to dynamically manage the gameplay experience. It monitors player performance and adjusts elements like enemy spawns, item availability, and environmental hazards in real-time. This technology is most famously used in the Left 4 Dead series and is a key example of adaptive AI in gaming. How will generative AI impact the variety of games on unblocked platforms? Generative AI is expected to exponentially increase the variety and volume of games available on unblocked platforms. By automating the creation of code, assets, and entire game worlds, tools like Rosebud AI empower creators without technical skills to rapidly produce new content, leading to a much broader and more diverse selection of titles.
