With momentum building toward a potential all-time high, a crypto analyst highlights that Dogecoin’s downside risk has significantly decreased. This positive shift is attributed to the recent bullish trend across the 1-month, 2-month, 3-month, and 6-month candles, which are now turning bullish. Dogecoin Price Outlook Brightens With Long-Term Candles In a recent technical analysis, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter) identified as ‘The Coach’ declared that the Dogecoin long-term candles, specifically the 1M, 2M, 3M, and 6M indicators, are all turning bullish. These monthly candles reflect a cryptocurrency’s price performance over an extended period and are often used to gauge larger market trends. Related Reading: This Crypto Analyst Correctly Predicted The Bitcoin Price Rise To $75,000, Here’s The Full Prediction In the case of Dogecoin, these long-term candles highlight that the meme coin has recorded consistent price increases, experiencing strong monthly, quarterly, and biannual market performance. Based on the long-term bull candles, The Coach surmised that the downside potential for Dogecoin has grossly reduced. This means that the likelihood of the Dogecoin price experiencing substantial declines is now much lower, suggesting a more stable and possibly bullish outlook in the near term. So far, analysts have suggested that if Dogecoin can bounce from its current price level of around $0.19, it could easily break the $0.22 threshold and prepare for its next bullish price target. While The Coach is confident of Dogecoin’s bullish outlook, he acknowledged that a few obstacles could hinder this projected price increase. Factors like market volatility could create sudden short-term fluctuations, making sustained price growth challenging for Dogecoin. Additionally, profit-taking from short-term holders could also stall Dogecoin’s momentum. DOGE Unlikely To Hit $1 This Month In another more recent X post, The Coach expressed optimism about Dogecoin’s price movement, highlighting the overall positive market trend for DOGE. However, he disclosed that it was uncertain if the meme coin could reach $1 this month. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts ‘The Final Ascent’ For Bitcoin Price, Why A Rise To $300,000 Is Possible From Here While a $1 price target may seem overly ambitious, The Coach has emphasized that Dogecoin will inevitably reach higher highs. He also noted that if Dogecoin were to hit the $1 mark, it would happen rapidly and without warning, leaving many struggling to comprehend how it occurred. Moreover, the analyst has revealed that with the support of SpaceX and Tesla Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Elon Musk and the newly elected US President, Donald Trump, Dogecoin could see even more bullish price increases, possibly reaching the new price highs around the $0.3 level. As of writing, the price of the meme coin is trading at $0.197, reflecting a 3.66% rise in the last 24 hours and a 24.15% increase over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap.

As the token retraces from recent highs, attention now turns to pivotal support levels that could dictate its recovery potential. Will these key levels hold the line and fuel a bounce-back, or is PEPE in for a longer dip? This article will provide an in-depth look at PEPE’s current price movement within its correctional phase. By highlighting significant support and resistance levels, this piece seeks to equip investors and traders with valuable insights into possible rebound zones and the factors that could influence its recovery or further declines. Understanding PEPE’s Correction: What Triggered The Pullback? PEPE has recently taken a bearish shift on the 4-hour chart, encountering strong resistance at $0.00001152. This struggle to sustain the uptrend has triggered a decline, pushing the asset toward the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). A drop below this SMA could amplify selling pressure, while a rebound might signal a potential price reversal. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that bullish strength may be waning. Currently, the RSI has fallen to around 68% from the overbought zone, indicating that the buying pressure is diminishing. If the RSI continues to drop, it may indicate that the market is becoming more oversold, possibly paving the way for a deeper correction. Related Reading: Analyst Says PEPE Bearish Continuation Is Possible For A 50% Price Crash On the daily chart, PEPE is exhibiting significant negative movement, as reflected by a bearish candlestick. This ongoing downward trend highlights a prevailing selling pressure within the market. Although the meme coin is currently trading above the 100-day SMA, which is typically seen as a bullish indicator, the strength of the bearish candlestick suggests that upward momentum may be limited. Finally, on the 1-day chart, the RSI signal line is approaching the critical 50% level after rising above it. The 50% mark represents a neutral zone, suggesting a balance between buying and selling pressure. A dip below 50% could signal a shift towards bearish sentiment, while holding above or climbing back above 50% may imply continued bullish strength, possibly leading to more price gains. Where PEPE Could Find Stability Key support levels are crucial price points where PEPE could find stability and reverse its current downtrend. One of the primary support levels to watch is the $0.000000766, which has historically acted as a crucial level of support. If PEPE’s price approaches this level, it could trigger renewed buying interest, potentially leading to a rebound.

However, should the meme coin break this level, it could lead to a prolonged decline, possibly pushing the price toward $0.00000589 and beyond.

Its accompanying SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ( NYSEARCA: SPY ) jumped 4.75% for the week. One of the most pivotal weeks of the year turned out to be records galore for Wall Street. The benchmark S&P ( SP500 ) took its tally of all-time closing highs to a half century for 2024, while also smashing past the 6,000 points level in a historic first. Though the gauge was unable to close above that mark, it was still on track to post its shortest gap between 1,000-point milestones on record. As if that weren't enough, the index posted its best weekly advance in just over a year. Meanwhile, the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJI ) notched its 41st and 42nd record close of the year, while also taking out the 44,000 points level for the first time ever. The blue-chip index posted its best weekly advance in just over a year as well. Moreover, its advance on Wednesday was its best intraday performance since November 10, 2022. Market participants began the week cautiously on Monday, as they geared up for the culmination of the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday and the penultimate Federal Reserve interest rate decision of the year on Thursday. On Election Day, the S&P ( SP500 ), Dow ( DJI ) and fellow major index the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( COMP:IND ) rallied ahead of the count. Then, as election night unfolded, and it started to become clear that former President Donald Trump was going to win, the so-called ""Trump trade"" gripped markets. U.S. stock futures swelled overnight, while assets that were seen to be benefiting by a second Trump administration saw a boost. The dollar soared, amid expectations that the greenback would rise in a low-tax and high-tariff environment. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) undoubtedly saw the most dramatic reaction, smashing past the $75K level. It has been embraced by Trump in his campaign, who this year became the first-ever major U.S. party nominee to accept donations in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and other cryptocurrencies. By the early hours of Wednesday, Trump, a Republican, had secured the 270 electoral votes needed to win against Democratic opponent Vice President Kamala Harris. The GOP also won the Senate, while the House remains undecided, though a red sweep seems most likely. The Trump trade lifted off in regular trading hours, with the S&P ( SP500 ) and the Dow ( DJI ) eventually notching their best post-election intraday climbs ever. The latter popped more than 1,500 points. ""A decisive U.S. election outcome requires a rethink of the global macroeconomic outlook, as our baseline, as well as most others, has incorporated an assumption of policy continuity. Within this framework that we have been pushing back against, most central banks and private forecasters project inflation returning quickly to 2% almost everywhere with growth proceeding at a trend-like pace,"" JPMorgan's Bruce Kasman said. On Thursday, the focus shifted to the Fed. The central bank delivered a 25 basis point rate cut as widely expected, following which chair Jerome Powell said both the labor market and inflation was normalizing . Traders took heart from Powell's remarks, and his praise of the resilience of the economy, and continued to be in a buying mood. That spilled into Friday, which gave enough of a boost to the S&P ( SP500 ) and Dow ( DJI ) to take out their historic milestones. Turning to the weekly performance of the S&P 500 ( SP500 ) sectors, all 11 ended in the green, led by a nearly 8% climb in Consumer Discretionary and a 6% rise in Energy. Technology added more than 5%. See below a breakdown of the performance of the sectors as well as their accompanying SPDR Select Sector ETFs from November 1 close to November 8 close: #1: Consumer Discretionary +7.62% , and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLY ) +7.51% . #2: Energy +6.16% , and the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF ( XLE ) +6.50% . #3: Industrials +5.93% , and the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF ( XLI ) +6.03% . #4: Financials +5.53% , and the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF ( XLF ) +5.47% . #5: Information Technology +5.44% , and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF ( XLK ) +5.92% . #6: Communication Services +3.72% , and the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLC ) +4.09% . #7: Real Estate +2.68% , and the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF ( XLRE ) +2.74% . #8: Health Care +1.57% , and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF ( XLV ) +1.65% . #9: Materials +1.46% , and the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF ( XLB ) +1.44% . #10: Consumer Staples +1.20% , and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF ( XLP ) +0.84% . #11: Utilities +1.19% , and the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF ( XLU ) +1.34% .

In several posts on X, prominent fund managers and industry leaders have projected a bullish outlook for Ethereum (ETH), positioning it to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) with a target price of $8,000. This optimism is underpinned by anticipated regulatory advancements for the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Why Ethereum Could Outperform Bitcoin Raoul Pal, Founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor, articulated his perspective on ETH’s potential resurgence in a post that has garnered significant attention within the crypto community. “I’ve been expecting ETH to start gaining lost ground on BTC. It’s partly driven by the risk-taking cycle but it’s also driven by the election,” Pal stated. Pal highlighted two primary factors contributing to ETH’s anticipated outperformance. The first one is the enhanced utility in DeFi: “Utility tokens in DeFi begin to offer yield or reward of underlying protocol which creates network value. Most of this is on ETH,” Pal explained. Related Reading: Ethereum Jumps 10% As DeFi Sentiment Rebounds With Trump’s Victory The second factor is the adoption by Traditional Finance (TradFi). “TradFi will likely begin to build larger use cases but on the most tested, adopted chain. Think of ETH (and the L2’s) as the Microsoft of web3. No one gets fired for using it,” Pal asserted. These developments, according to Pal, are poised to “dramatically re-rate ETH and offset the current retail adoption on other chains,” with the added advantage that ETH yields will attract more institutional players. He emphasized the potential for constructing sophisticated financial products, such as guaranteed funds, under improved regulatory conditions. “With better regs this activity will explode,” Pal concluded. Supporting Pal’s outlook, Dan Tapiero, founder and CEO of 10T Holdings—a growth equity fund specializing in mid-to-late stage investments within the digital asset ecosystem—commented on Pal’s post: “Yup. More eloquent version of what I posted last night. Very funny.” Tapiero referenced his own earlier assertion that “Ethereum too cheap. Gonna explode from here. Gensler and Co killed Defi in the US in ’22-24. Not killed now. Long Live US Defi. Break of $4k going over $8k in the next year.” Related Reading: Ethereum Surges Past $2,500: What The Futures Market Signals For Traders However, Pal also noted a hierarchical adoption landscape within the crypto space, suggesting that while ETH may outpace BTC, it might underperform Solana (SOL) and, subsequently, Sui (SUI). “My view is that ETH begins to outpace BTC for the rest of the cycle but underperforms SOL and SOL underperforms SUI as SUI is in the ultimate performance stage of adoption – early > proven. Let’s see,” he remarked. The discourse around Ethereum’s prospects also attracted engagement from the broader crypto community. A user named Himura (@aceddeca1) proposed an alternative investment thesis: “ETH will be fine but if that is your thesis it would be better spent on UNI especially with Unichain … Uniswap going to own chain is the base token you wish Coinbase would launch.” Pal responded succinctly, “Interesting thought.” Additionally, concerns regarding potential biases were raised by user Galavis (@FedericoGalavis): “Be careful with SUI folks as only 0.82% of the supply has been unlocked. Are you a paid SUI promoter Raoul? If you are you better disclose.” Pal countered, “You need to do more research on all your comments,” addressing the speculation over his impartiality. Notably, Pal serves as a Board Member at the Sui Foundation, a fact that may inform perceptions of his commentary on SUI. At press time, ETH traded at $2,916.

For many reasons, this year’s US presidential elections have become the most consequential for cryptocurrency. Crypto and blockchain technology has become an election issue, with both the Republican and Democratic candidates teasing the electorate with their plans on how to handle crypto. Related Reading: Binance Coin Breaks $600! Is There More Upside Ahead For BNB? Between the two, incoming President Donald Trump offered a more friendly stance over crypto, promising to make the US a “crypto capital” and suggesting a change in leadership at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Now that Trump is the next president, all eyes are on the SEC and the expected reshuffle. And the latest political chatter suggests that the high-profile job will probably go to Dan Gallagher, Robinhood’s Chief Legal Officer. Many expect Trump to announce in January 2025 the next SEC chief, as the clamor for the agency’s Gary Gensler’s exit intensifies. Gensler In Hot Seat Before Elections Many expect Gensler to be one of the high-profile exits once Trump takes office. Gensler has waged legal fights against the crypto community for years, including Binance and Ripple’s XRP. His aggressive policies against crypto and its personalities have earned him plenty of detractors and enemies. With Gensler’s increasing unpopularity, many have demanded his resignation. Trump acknowledged the issue and promised a revamp of the SEC once he wins. Even Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse has blamed Gensler for the Democrat’s loss this election. Now, Reuters reports that Robinhood’s Dan Gallagher is considered the top contender for Gensler’s post. Robinhood’s Dan Gallagher As Next SEC Chair? Dan Gallagher currently serves as Robinhood’s Chief Legal Officer. Gallagher was a SEC commissioner from 2011 to 2015 before joining the company. Also, Gallagher enjoys wide popularity among cryptocurrency bigwigs, especially among Trump donors. At least two sources have confirmed that the former SEC commissioner is in the running to become the next chair of the agency. Although the selection process is still open, Gallagher’s pro-innovation policies give him an advantage over other hopefuls. He advocates for tighter regulation of cryptocurrencies and supports market liberalization. Previously, Gallagher campaigned to treat digital assets like Bitcoin as a distinct asset class, not as securities. In short, the SEC can see a more crypto-friendly policy once Gallagher takes oath. Related Reading: Solana Rockets Past BNB To Claim Coveted 4th Spot In Crypto Ranks Other Candidates In Consideration Aside from Gallagher, a few other names are floated as Gensler’s replacement. For example, some in the crypto industry are looking at Hester Pierce, who is a SEC Commissioner, to become the next SEC chair. However, some insiders have shared that Pierce isn’t keen on taking the job. Another candidate in the running is Mark Uyeda, who was appointed as SEC commissioner on June 30, 2022. Multiple reports also mentioned Paul Atkins, former Republican SEC Commissioner, and Robert Stebbins – who was named SEC General Counsel in May 2017 — as possible Gensler replacement.

Amid this, a CryptoQuant analyst known as TraderOasis provided an in-depth analysis of Bitcoin’s market earlier today, suggesting the trajectory the asset could head to next. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Bull Run: MVRV Metric Hints At $95K To $120K Target Analysis On Bitcoin Oasis explained that his previously outlined bullish scenario for the Range 0.5 structure had played out successfully, emphasizing the importance of Bitcoin’s previous all-time high (ATH) level as potential support. This level, represented by the blue line in his chart analysis (shown above), could be a critical marker for Bitcoin’s next phase, the analyst reveals. The analyst also highlighted the significance of the Coinbase Premium Index, which often indicates strong buying demand on Coinbase relative to other exchanges. Oasis noted that the bullish shift in this indicator was accompanied by an upward price move, marking an important resistance zone that Bitcoin needs to overcome to sustain its momentum. Furthermore, he pointed out that the open interest indicator, which tracks the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, was moving alongside the price. According to him, this is a positive signal indicating that market participation remains strong without signs of instability or excessive leverage. Rising Funding Rates And Exchange Netflow Observations TraderOasis also delved into another key metric: funding rates. These rates reflect the cost of holding long positions in perpetual futures contracts and can signal market sentiment. The analyst observed that funding rates had begun to rise again, suggesting that market participants are increasingly confident about further upward movement. However, he cautioned that this sentiment had not yet reached extreme levels that could indicate overheating or a potential correction. The analyst mentioned monitoring these levels is essential, as excessive funding rates often signal market tops or heightened volatility. Another aspect of analysis was the activity observed in exchange netflow for spot exchanges. According to Oasis, a significant sell-off was reflected in this indicator, which measures the net flow of Bitcoin into and out of exchanges. Given the potential for increased volatility, the analyst interpreted this as a signal to consider taking profits on long trades. This aligns with previous market patterns where high net inflows or outflows often foreshadow shifts in market sentiment and price direction.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has jumped 21.9% in the past three days, reigniting investors’ bullish sentiment for the crypto and ETH-based investment products. Related Reading: Ethereum L2 Project Spark Launches On-Chain Order Book On Fuel Network To Enhance Trading Ethereum ETFs See Third Best-performing Day Amid ETH’s price rally, spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have recorded their best-performing day in 13 weeks. Launched in late July, ETH ETFs have seen a shaky performance in the past few months. The crypto investment products surpassed experts’ expectations during its first two days. However, ETH ETFs recorded massive outflows amid Q3 market retraces. Ethereum-based products saw their second-largest single-day inflow since launch during the early August correction. As the market recovered from the crash, Ethereum ETFs registered $98.4 million in positive net flows, led by Blackrock’s ETHA. Since then, the crypto products have struggled to break past the $20 million mark, only registering inflows above that range five times in three months. ETH’s current rally has seemingly improved sentiment around the cryptocurrency and the investment products based on it, as it has recorded a notable performance during the last two days. Ethereum ETFs recorded their best-performing day in six weeks, seeing $52.3 million in inflows on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the investment products saw their third-largest single-day performance on Thursday and their best day since August 6, with $79.7 million in inflows. ETH Rallies 16%, Is $3,500 Next? Ethereum has seen a massive 16.6% surge in the last seven days, jumping from the $2,500 support zone to the $2,900 mark lost mid-Q3. The “King of Altcoins” lost the $3,000 support zone in early August, recording a 23% correction during the market retraces. The cryptocurrency struggled to break past the crucial $2,800 resistance level, being rejected from this level for the past three months. However, Republican candidate Donald Trump’s victory in the Thursday presidential elections has given the whole crypto market a renewed push toward the second leg of the bull run. In the last three days, the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), has entered price discovery mode, setting its latest all-time high (ATH) at $76,800 on Thursday. Meanwhile, Ethereum saw its price move from the $2,400 range to near the long-awaited $3,000 resistance. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted that ETH’s recent performance filled its GME gap, which formed in early August. The gap saw ETH’s price go from $3,000 to $2,700 before crashing on August 5. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Looks ‘More Bullish Than Before’ After Flipping BNB As 4th Largest Crypto Per the analyst, a weekly close above the current levels, followed by a retest, would confirm ETH’s breakout from the 3-month range. Moreover, reclaiming the $2,900 resistance would “set ETH up for a move to $3,500 over time,” which could further propel Ethereum’s rally toward its yearly high above $4,000. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,925, a 4.2% increase in the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin Could Now Be Entering Phase 2 Of The Bull Run In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has pointed out how the recent trend in the Bitcoin long-term holder supply has been reminiscent to what was observed in the 2017 cycle. The long-term holders (LTHs) make up for one of the two main divisions of the BTC userbase done on the basis of holding time, with the other side being known as the short-term holders (STHs). The cutoff between these two cohorts is 155 days, with investors who bought inside this window being part of the STHs, while those holding since more than it falling in the LTHs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Enters Danger Zone: Investors Now Extremely Greedy Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell said coins at any point. Thus, the LTHs are considered to include the more resolute market participants. Below is a chart that shows the trend in the combined amount of supply held by the participants of the respective Bitcoin groups. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin LTH supply observed a sharp decline back during the rally of the first quarter of the year, suggesting that even these diamond hands couldn’t resist the temptation of profit-taking. Alongside this decrease in the LTH supply, the STH supply naturally went up, as whenever the LTHs transfer their tokens on the blockchain, they become part of the STH cohort instead. Recently, the LTH supply had reversed this drawdown from earlier in the year, but with the latest rally to the new all-time high (ATH), the metric has again switched directions. In the chart, the quant has highlighted how a similar pattern was also witnessed back during the 2017 cycle; a first phase of distribution from the LTHs was followed by accumulation, which then led to a second phase of distribution. Related Reading: Dogecoin Descending Triangle Could Hint At Next Destination For DOGE It’s possible that the latest turnaround in the LTH supply is the start of the phase 2 distribution for the current cycle, where fresh capital flows in to take coins off the hands of the HODLers. The LTH supply isn’t the only metric that’s showing a trend that matches that of the previous cycle. As the chart shared by the analyst shows, the Bitcoin Binary CDD is also forming an interesting pattern. The Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) basically tells us about whether the HODLers are selling less or more than the historical average. From the graph, it’s apparent that the 152-day moving average (MA) of this metric may be showing a second breakout similar to the one that led into the 2021 bull run.

At present, the cryptocurrency is trading at $76,587, reflecting a modest 0.9% dip from its peak while still marking a 1.7% daily increase. This stability signals resilience and has fuelled speculation regarding Bitcoin’s next price move. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Current Price Action Sets Stage For 30% Rally, Says Crypto Analyst Bitcoin Miners Hold Back On Selling, Why? As Bitcoin currently trades above $76,000, a CryptoQuant analyst identified as theKriptolik has pointed out a notable trend among Bitcoin miners. According to theKriptolik, miners are refraining from selling their BTC holdings, even with the asset trading near its ATH, as they believe the current valuation remains undervalued. The analyst highlighted that miners typically transfer BTC to exchanges and sell it when prices approach an ATH, partly to cover their operational expenses. However, this behaviour has not been observed recently, signifying a potential belief in further price gains. TheKriptolik elaborated on this behaviour by referencing miner activity on October 29, when a substantial inflow of BTC to exchanges occurred, resulting in a sale of the holdings with no corresponding outflows. This lack of recent exchange-bound transfers indicates miners’ confidence in Bitcoin’s ongoing upward momentum. Historically, miner behaviour has served as a key indicator of market sentiment, with sales often coinciding with market tops. Optimism Among Analysts And Technical Signals The positive sentiment among miners is mirrored by other market analysts, who have offered bullish forecasts for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Javon Marks, a prominent crypto analyst, noted that Bitcoin’s ability to maintain a stronghold above a critical $67,559 level sets the stage for further upward movement. According to Marks, Bitcoin could experience a rally of over 51%, potentially pushing the price to $116,652. Marks emphasized that this movement could unfold at a faster pace than many market participants currently anticipate, driven by strong underlying market dynamics. Similarly, another CryptoQuant analyst, Mignolet, has provided an outlook that suggests the conditions for Bitcoin entering the second phase of its bull rally are falling into place. Mignolet explained that this transition involves changes in market participant behaviour, particularly among long-term holders (LTHs) and short-term holders (STHs). As LTH supply begins to be distributed, an influx of new liquidity and capital is critical to sustaining the rally’s momentum. According to Mignolet, the current market environment, characterized by increased liquidity and echoes of the 2017 bull cycle, supports the completion of Phase 2 of Bitcoin’s price surge. Conditions for entering Phase 2 are being completed “A key condition for moving into Phase 2 is an increase in STH supply, specifically through a surge in new capital. Currently, the market is experiencing abundant new liquidity.” – By @mignoletkr Link 👇… pic.twitter.com/gszfQFcn13 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 8, 2024 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin market|bitcoin price|Bitcoin price analysis|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto market,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-11-09 11:00:21

Trump's promises to replace SEC Chairman, create a US Sovereign Bitcoin Reserve, and lower interest rates are key catalysts for Bitcoin's growth. The potential for a Trump administration to support Bitcoin mining rights and self-custody of digital assets further strengthens the bullish outlook. Investors should monitor macroeconomic factors and Trump's ability to deliver on promises, as failure could lead to near-term volatility. Investment Thesis Now that election results have been published showing overwhelming support for a Trump 2.0 presidency, it is time for businesses and investors to realign their outlook and shift their operating strategies that align with the policy framework of the incoming US President while keeping a tab of the broader economic narrative. While this year’s House election results are still to come in, the GOP is quite close to building on its incumbency in the House, pointing to a repeat of 2016 where President Trump was bolstered by support from the GOP that had control in the Senate and the House. This should give President Trump an easier path to execute his agenda as laid out in his 2024 election mandate . Although digital assets and cryptocurrency took up some much smaller real estate in Trump’s 2.0 mandate document, piecing together the incoming president’s commentary from multiple sources indicates that cryptocurrency, headlined by Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), will play a larger role in President Trump’s second term. Of all the promises that Trump has made on supporting Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency community, I find the likelihood is high for his team to deliver on at least X of those promises next year, which is positive for Bitcoin. In addition, the ongoing strength of Bitcoin’s onchain indicators suggests Bitcoin’s rally is slated to continue higher. I remain bullish on Bitcoin and reiterate my Bullish recommendation. 3 promises That Can Be Delivered By Trump 2.0 Next Year I have repeatedly expressed my confidence in Bitcoin through the year, where I explained how broader macroeconomic indicators were ripe for Bitcoin, and this coincided with onchain indicators that supported the upward trajectory of Bitcoin. In fact, when Bitcoin corrected in August, I published another research note at the time explaining why the correction was unwarranted since it had no relation with the liquidity concerns coming out of Japan’s “Yentervention.” To me, that correction presented a buying opportunity, which I took advantage of and upped my stake in Bitcoin. At Bitcoin’s current juncture, I continue to hold a favorable outlook on Bitcoin and believe the elections will support a positive narrative over the next twelve months as we usher in a new president. In Trump’s election mandate, his team made a small mention of how his government will “defend the right to mine Bitcoin” while ensuring “every American has the right to self-custody of their Digital Assets.” While that doesn’t say as much as the other sections of his mandate, Trump’s commentary from various speaking engagements through this year strongly indicates the direction his governmental framework will work towards when it comes to supporting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 1. Replacing the SEC Chairman Current SEC chairman Gary Gensler’s policy framework has not been well received by the crypto community, with over 100 enforcement actions against various actors and entities in the crypto community leading to crypto-related fines rising by over 3000% percent in just one year to $4.7B. Chairman Gensler’s term was mired with lawsuits and obscurity and an often comical vagueness that led to confusion among developers, innovators, and investors in the crypto community. A recent example of the back-and-forth by the SEC was when the commission closed its investigation again into its claim of Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) being a security. Trump has strongly indicated multiple times in the past that he would replace Chairman Gensler with someone who is viewed as more friendly towards the crypto network. Although Chairman Gensler’s term ends in June 2026, some market analysts expect Chairman Gensler to step down . Heath Tarbert or Dan Gallagher, both ex-SEC alumni and currently serving as Chief Legal Officers of their respective for-profit crypto companies, are strong contenders and viewed positively by the crypto community. Any change in SEC’s leadership is bound to spark a strong rally among Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 2. The US Government’s own Sovereign Bitcoin Reserve Most recently in the Nashville Bitcoin conference earlier this year, President Trump pledged to create an advisory council responsible for designing “transparent regulatory guidance for the benefit of the entire industry” and has mentioned to do so within 100 days of being elected as President. The inauguration of an advisory council would most likely be another near-term positive catalyst for Bitcoin, although the longer-term framework policies still need to be seen. Still, part of the council’s policy framework would be to create concrete steps towards fortifying the base for a US SBR (Strategic Bitcoin Reserve) that the incoming President envisions to be built on top of the existing Bitcoin custody that law enforcement has confiscated from bad actors in the system. That figure currently stands at ~$15 billion per exhibit B. Trump’s allure for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is a reversal in sentiment from his earlier presidency, and, during this year, the incoming president also started accepting cryptocurrency donations and minting his own NFTs before that. Exhibit A: US Government’s custody of Bitcoin currently stands at ~$15 billion. (Arkham) However, it’s not fully clear yet as to how the US government’s current Bitcoin holdings can be absorbed into an SBR since most of the Bitcoin here is confiscated and is likely held to be returned back to the victims of previous crypto scams. Trump has also loosely suggested in the past that these reserves could be used in the future to pay off the $35 trillion national debt. But again, any concrete steps towards building a reserve and at least codifying policies to create the SBR will be a huge catalyst towards Bitcoin’s price. 3. Lower Interest Rates Perhaps the most important factor and one with an immediate impact on Bitcoin’s price would be the movement of interest rates. Trump has been a strong proponent of lowering interest rates, which is part of his larger mandate to lower costs and prices for American consumers. At the National Association of Black Journalists’ annual convention in July this year , he said he would “bring interest rates way down.” Although the governance of interest rates falls under the purview of the Federal Reserve and is outside the authority of a US President, watching interest rates and any other monetary or fiscal catalyst that can impact interest rates is crucial to forming the outlook for Bitcoin, Gold, and any other inflation hedge. Despite this, expect Trump to be watching the interest rate line closely. The US Fed cut interest rates by another 25 bp this week, now targeting the 4.50%-4.75% range. This should have a positive impact on the global money supply, as I have mentioned in the past, which is forward-positive for Bitcoin, as can be seen in the chart below: Exhibit B: As global money supply is set to rise after interest rate cuts, Bitcoin’s momentum should continue into next year. (bGeometrics) Onchain Metrics Look Healthy, Looking For More Strength The correction in Bitcoin prices pushed many investors away from Bitcoin, leading to less than seen activity. However, the number of active addresses increasing is a good positive sign for the network, seeing one of the best increases in months. Even better is the active participation from newer addresses, as seen below. Exhibit C: Bitcoin’s onchain metrics look stable and might be about to get better (Various sources) The monthly transaction volume from these accounts has been lukewarm, but I am encouraged by the spurt in growth seen in the 7-day moving average of on-chain volume, which should be positive for Bitcoin. I expect these trends to continue to get better as the political narrative shapes up based on the points discussed in this research note. Risks & Other Factors To Look For With all the optimism with a new Trump 2.0 tenure about crypto, investors must be cautious about risks associated with some of the changes that could be pushed by the incoming administration. While Trump has repeatedly threatened to fire previous officials, such as the current SEC Chairperson as well as the current Fed Chair, any unceremonious removal that does not follow due procedure might set dangerous precedent and could be seen as a risk by the investor community. While Fed Chair Powell has explicitly stated that “ he wouldn’t resign ,” SEC Chair Gensler has remained quiet so far, which may indicate that he would resign himself, paving the way for the next Trump-appointed SEC Chair. On a broader level, investors must also assess the macroeconomic landscape, especially the global money supply levels, which, in my opinion, remain one of the strongest indicators to assess the forward outlook for Bitcoin. Lastly, and most importantly, if Trump fails to deliver on these promises, investors should expect some near-to-midterm volatility, especially if there are no concrete steps taken by the Trump 2.0 administration within 100 days. Takeaway I believe Bitcoin should be able to move higher, potentially even reaching the 6-figure dollar mark next year, should current onchain metrics sustain and improve from current levels. As incoming President Trump prepares to take over the keys to the White House, I expect some more upward pressure in Bitcoin’s price on the optimism for the incoming President. A Trump 2.0 should be generally favorable for Bitcoin and crypto currencies moving forward, and I expect the next 3-4 months to experience some further upside in Bitcoin as election promises fall into delivery mode.

The premier cryptocurrency specifically has breached and printed new all-time high prices over the past few days. Interestingly, the price of BTC has shown no signs of weakness going into the weekend, with the market leader forging a new record high above $77,000 on Friday, November 8. While the hot streak of the Bitcoin price can be attributed to the latest victory of former president Donald Trump in the US, on-chain data suggests that this rally has been a long time coming. BTC’s Realized Cap Experiences Largest Increase In Two Years One of the latest on-chain metrics to offer an interesting insight into the meteoric rise of Bitcoin’s price is the realized cap indicator. In a November 8 post on the X platform, blockchain analytics firm Glassnode revealed that Bitcoin’s realized cap recently reached a new all-time high of $656 billion.

This offers a more interesting way to evaluate the cost basis (the time in which the coins changed hands) as opposed to the regular market capitalization, which is derived by multiplying the total number of circulating coins by the current market price. Data from Glassnode shows that the Bitcoin realized cap witnessed a 3.8% upswing in the past 30 days, which represents one of the metric’s largest increases since January 2023. As shown in the chart below, this metric has been experiencing positive growth since the start of the year, as the 30-day net change has mostly been green. It is worth mentioning that the realized cap metric also represents the amount of capital flowing in and out of the flagship cryptocurrency. The latest increase reflects a net capital inflow of over $2.5 billion in the past month, suggesting the entry of new investors — both retail and institutional investors. With the realized cap and Bitcoin price consolidating over the past few months, a sudden increase of the former to $656 billion suggests that the premier cryptocurrency might be moving from the “reaccumulation” phase to a markup phase. Ultimately, a continuation of the capital inflow trend could sustain the increase in the Bitcoin price over the next couple of months. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin is valued at around $76,700, having lost its hold above the historical $77,000 level. According to CoinGecko data, the market leader is up by an impressive 10% in the past week.
