With momentum building toward a potential all-time high, a crypto analyst highlights that Dogecoin’s downside risk has significantly decreased. This positive shift is attributed to the recent bullish trend across the 1-month, 2-month, 3-month, and 6-month candles, which are now turning bullish. Dogecoin Price Outlook Brightens With Long-Term Candles In a recent technical analysis, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter) identified as ‘The Coach’ declared that the Dogecoin long-term candles, specifically the 1M, 2M, 3M, and 6M indicators, are all turning bullish. These monthly candles reflect a cryptocurrency’s price performance over an extended period and are often used to gauge larger market trends. Related Reading: This Crypto Analyst Correctly Predicted The Bitcoin Price Rise To $75,000, Here’s The Full Prediction In the case of Dogecoin, these long-term candles highlight that the meme coin has recorded consistent price increases, experiencing strong monthly, quarterly, and biannual market performance. Based on the long-term bull candles, The Coach surmised that the downside potential for Dogecoin has grossly reduced. This means that the likelihood of the Dogecoin price experiencing substantial declines is now much lower, suggesting a more stable and possibly bullish outlook in the near term. So far, analysts have suggested that if Dogecoin can bounce from its current price level of around $0.19, it could easily break the $0.22 threshold and prepare for its next bullish price target. While The Coach is confident of Dogecoin’s bullish outlook, he acknowledged that a few obstacles could hinder this projected price increase. Factors like market volatility could create sudden short-term fluctuations, making sustained price growth challenging for Dogecoin. Additionally, profit-taking from short-term holders could also stall Dogecoin’s momentum. DOGE Unlikely To Hit $1 This Month In another more recent X post, The Coach expressed optimism about Dogecoin’s price movement, highlighting the overall positive market trend for DOGE. However, he disclosed that it was uncertain if the meme coin could reach $1 this month. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts ‘The Final Ascent’ For Bitcoin Price, Why A Rise To $300,000 Is Possible From Here While a $1 price target may seem overly ambitious, The Coach has emphasized that Dogecoin will inevitably reach higher highs. He also noted that if Dogecoin were to hit the $1 mark, it would happen rapidly and without warning, leaving many struggling to comprehend how it occurred. Moreover, the analyst has revealed that with the support of SpaceX and Tesla Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Elon Musk and the newly elected US President, Donald Trump, Dogecoin could see even more bullish price increases, possibly reaching the new price highs around the $0.3 level. As of writing, the price of the meme coin is trading at $0.197, reflecting a 3.66% rise in the last 24 hours and a 24.15% increase over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap.

As the token retraces from recent highs, attention now turns to pivotal support levels that could dictate its recovery potential. Will these key levels hold the line and fuel a bounce-back, or is PEPE in for a longer dip? This article will provide an in-depth look at PEPE’s current price movement within its correctional phase. By highlighting significant support and resistance levels, this piece seeks to equip investors and traders with valuable insights into possible rebound zones and the factors that could influence its recovery or further declines. Understanding PEPE’s Correction: What Triggered The Pullback? PEPE has recently taken a bearish shift on the 4-hour chart, encountering strong resistance at $0.00001152. This struggle to sustain the uptrend has triggered a decline, pushing the asset toward the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). A drop below this SMA could amplify selling pressure, while a rebound might signal a potential price reversal. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that bullish strength may be waning. Currently, the RSI has fallen to around 68% from the overbought zone, indicating that the buying pressure is diminishing. If the RSI continues to drop, it may indicate that the market is becoming more oversold, possibly paving the way for a deeper correction. Related Reading: Analyst Says PEPE Bearish Continuation Is Possible For A 50% Price Crash On the daily chart, PEPE is exhibiting significant negative movement, as reflected by a bearish candlestick. This ongoing downward trend highlights a prevailing selling pressure within the market. Although the meme coin is currently trading above the 100-day SMA, which is typically seen as a bullish indicator, the strength of the bearish candlestick suggests that upward momentum may be limited. Finally, on the 1-day chart, the RSI signal line is approaching the critical 50% level after rising above it. The 50% mark represents a neutral zone, suggesting a balance between buying and selling pressure. A dip below 50% could signal a shift towards bearish sentiment, while holding above or climbing back above 50% may imply continued bullish strength, possibly leading to more price gains. Where PEPE Could Find Stability Key support levels are crucial price points where PEPE could find stability and reverse its current downtrend. One of the primary support levels to watch is the $0.000000766, which has historically acted as a crucial level of support. If PEPE’s price approaches this level, it could trigger renewed buying interest, potentially leading to a rebound.

However, should the meme coin break this level, it could lead to a prolonged decline, possibly pushing the price toward $0.00000589 and beyond.

Its accompanying SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ( NYSEARCA: SPY ) jumped 4.75% for the week. One of the most pivotal weeks of the year turned out to be records galore for Wall Street. The benchmark S&P ( SP500 ) took its tally of all-time closing highs to a half century for 2024, while also smashing past the 6,000 points level in a historic first. Though the gauge was unable to close above that mark, it was still on track to post its shortest gap between 1,000-point milestones on record. As if that weren't enough, the index posted its best weekly advance in just over a year. Meanwhile, the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJI ) notched its 41st and 42nd record close of the year, while also taking out the 44,000 points level for the first time ever. The blue-chip index posted its best weekly advance in just over a year as well. Moreover, its advance on Wednesday was its best intraday performance since November 10, 2022. Market participants began the week cautiously on Monday, as they geared up for the culmination of the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday and the penultimate Federal Reserve interest rate decision of the year on Thursday. On Election Day, the S&P ( SP500 ), Dow ( DJI ) and fellow major index the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( COMP:IND ) rallied ahead of the count. Then, as election night unfolded, and it started to become clear that former President Donald Trump was going to win, the so-called ""Trump trade"" gripped markets. U.S. stock futures swelled overnight, while assets that were seen to be benefiting by a second Trump administration saw a boost. The dollar soared, amid expectations that the greenback would rise in a low-tax and high-tariff environment. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) undoubtedly saw the most dramatic reaction, smashing past the $75K level. It has been embraced by Trump in his campaign, who this year became the first-ever major U.S. party nominee to accept donations in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and other cryptocurrencies. By the early hours of Wednesday, Trump, a Republican, had secured the 270 electoral votes needed to win against Democratic opponent Vice President Kamala Harris. The GOP also won the Senate, while the House remains undecided, though a red sweep seems most likely. The Trump trade lifted off in regular trading hours, with the S&P ( SP500 ) and the Dow ( DJI ) eventually notching their best post-election intraday climbs ever. The latter popped more than 1,500 points. ""A decisive U.S. election outcome requires a rethink of the global macroeconomic outlook, as our baseline, as well as most others, has incorporated an assumption of policy continuity. Within this framework that we have been pushing back against, most central banks and private forecasters project inflation returning quickly to 2% almost everywhere with growth proceeding at a trend-like pace,"" JPMorgan's Bruce Kasman said. On Thursday, the focus shifted to the Fed. The central bank delivered a 25 basis point rate cut as widely expected, following which chair Jerome Powell said both the labor market and inflation was normalizing . Traders took heart from Powell's remarks, and his praise of the resilience of the economy, and continued to be in a buying mood. That spilled into Friday, which gave enough of a boost to the S&P ( SP500 ) and Dow ( DJI ) to take out their historic milestones.

In several posts on X, prominent fund managers and industry leaders have projected a bullish outlook for Ethereum (ETH), positioning it to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) with a target price of $8,000. This optimism is underpinned by anticipated regulatory advancements for the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Why Ethereum Could Outperform Bitcoin Raoul Pal, Founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor, articulated his perspective on ETH’s potential resurgence in a post that has garnered significant attention within the crypto community. “I’ve been expecting ETH to start gaining lost ground on BTC. It’s partly driven by the risk-taking cycle but it’s also driven by the election,” Pal stated. Pal highlighted two primary factors contributing to ETH’s anticipated outperformance. The first one is the enhanced utility in DeFi: “Utility tokens in DeFi begin to offer yield or reward of underlying protocol which creates network value. Most of this is on ETH,” Pal explained. Related Reading: Ethereum Jumps 10% As DeFi Sentiment Rebounds With Trump’s Victory The second factor is the adoption by Traditional Finance (TradFi). “TradFi will likely begin to build larger use cases but on the most tested, adopted chain. Think of ETH (and the L2’s) as the Microsoft of web3. No one gets fired for using it,” Pal asserted. These developments, according to Pal, are poised to “dramatically re-rate ETH and offset the current retail adoption on other chains,” with the added advantage that ETH yields will attract more institutional players. He emphasized the potential for constructing sophisticated financial products, such as guaranteed funds, under improved regulatory conditions. “With better regs this activity will explode,” Pal concluded. Supporting Pal’s outlook, Dan Tapiero, founder and CEO of 10T Holdings—a growth equity fund specializing in mid-to-late stage investments within the digital asset ecosystem—commented on Pal’s post: “Yup. More eloquent version of what I posted last night. Very funny.” Tapiero referenced his own earlier assertion that “Ethereum too cheap. Gonna explode from here. Gensler and Co killed Defi in the US in ’22-24. Not killed now. Long Live US Defi. Break of $4k going over $8k in the next year.” Related Reading: Ethereum Surges Past $2,500: What The Futures Market Signals For Traders However, Pal also noted a hierarchical adoption landscape within the crypto space, suggesting that while ETH may outpace BTC, it might underperform Solana (SOL) and, subsequently, Sui (SUI). “My view is that ETH begins to outpace BTC for the rest of the cycle but underperforms SOL and SOL underperforms SUI as SUI is in the ultimate performance stage of adoption – early > proven. Let’s see,” he remarked. The discourse around Ethereum’s prospects also attracted engagement from the broader crypto community. A user named Himura (@aceddeca1) proposed an alternative investment thesis: “ETH will be fine but if that is your thesis it would be better spent on UNI especially with Unichain … Uniswap going to own chain is the base token you wish Coinbase would launch.” Pal responded succinctly, “Interesting thought.” Additionally, concerns regarding potential biases were raised by user Galavis (@FedericoGalavis): “Be careful with SUI folks as only 0.82% of the supply has been unlocked. Are you a paid SUI promoter Raoul? If you are you better disclose.” Pal countered, “You need to do more research on all your comments,” addressing the speculation over his impartiality. Notably, Pal serves as a Board Member at the Sui Foundation, a fact that may inform perceptions of his commentary on SUI. At press time, ETH traded at $2,916.

For many reasons, this year’s US presidential elections have become the most consequential for cryptocurrency. Crypto and blockchain technology has become an election issue, with both the Republican and Democratic candidates teasing the electorate with their plans on how to handle crypto. Related Reading: Binance Coin Breaks $600! Is There More Upside Ahead For BNB? Between the two, incoming President Donald Trump offered a more friendly stance over crypto, promising to make the US a “crypto capital” and suggesting a change in leadership at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Now that Trump is the next president, all eyes are on the SEC and the expected reshuffle. And the latest political chatter suggests that the high-profile job will probably go to Dan Gallagher, Robinhood’s Chief Legal Officer. Many expect Trump to announce in January 2025 the next SEC chief, as the clamor for the agency’s Gary Gensler’s exit intensifies. Gensler In Hot Seat Before Elections Many expect Gensler to be one of the high-profile exits once Trump takes office. Gensler has waged legal fights against the crypto community for years, including Binance and Ripple’s XRP. His aggressive policies against crypto and its personalities have earned him plenty of detractors and enemies. With Gensler’s increasing unpopularity, many have demanded his resignation. Trump acknowledged the issue and promised a revamp of the SEC once he wins. Even Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse has blamed Gensler for the Democrat’s loss this election. Now, Reuters reports that Robinhood’s Dan Gallagher is considered the top contender for Gensler’s post. Robinhood’s Dan Gallagher As Next SEC Chair? Dan Gallagher currently serves as Robinhood’s Chief Legal Officer. Gallagher was a SEC commissioner from 2011 to 2015 before joining the company. Also, Gallagher enjoys wide popularity among cryptocurrency bigwigs, especially among Trump donors. At least two sources have confirmed that the former SEC commissioner is in the running to become the next chair of the agency. Although the selection process is still open, Gallagher’s pro-innovation policies give him an advantage over other hopefuls. He advocates for tighter regulation of cryptocurrencies and supports market liberalization. Previously, Gallagher campaigned to treat digital assets like Bitcoin as a distinct asset class, not as securities. In short, the SEC can see a more crypto-friendly policy once Gallagher takes oath.

For example, some in the crypto industry are looking at Hester Pierce, who is a SEC Commissioner, to become the next SEC chair. However, some insiders have shared that Pierce isn’t keen on taking the job. Another candidate in the running is Mark Uyeda, who was appointed as SEC commissioner on June 30, 2022. Multiple reports also mentioned Paul Atkins, former Republican SEC Commissioner, and Robert Stebbins – who was named SEC General Counsel in May 2017 — as possible Gensler replacement.
