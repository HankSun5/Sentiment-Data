The new tokens, USDi and suiUSDe, are expected to launch later this year, according to a press release . USDi will be backed 1:1 by BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund BUIDL issued with tokenization specialist Securitize. Meanwhile, suiUSDe will mirror Ethena’s $14 billion USDe offering, a synthetic dollar backed by a mix of digital assets and short derivatives. ""We believe this initiative will add another powerful mechanism to drive liquidity, utility, and long-term value across the Sui blockchain, while positioning SUIG as one of the first publicly traded gateways to the global stablecoin economy,"" Marius Barnett, chairman of SUIG, said in a statement. The move is the latest example of crypto ecosystems making steps to issue proprietary stablecoins partnering with service providers instead of solely relying on the existing offerings such as Circle's USDC (USDC) and Tether's USDT (USDT). For example, Hyperliquid (HYPE), a layer-1 network known for its popular on-chain perpetual swaps exchange, held an auction for the rights of issuing the native USDH stablecoin to curb its reliance on USDC, with Native Markets in partnership with Stripe winning the competition. MegaETH, an Ethereum scaling network designed for fast transactions, also announced to launch a native stablecoin, partnering with Ethena. In August, the Sui network processed $229 billion in stablecoin transfer volume, outpacing its previous records, according to a Sui Foundation blog post . That kind of throughput is part of what drew Ethena to the chain.

Memecoins bring users but enrich platforms and bots. Launchpad Pump.fun accounts for a large share of Solana token launches and fees. Median hold times fell from ~300s to ~100s, highlighting bot-driven trading. memecoins drive platform revenue, not trader profits — read how launchpads and bots capture value. Learn more from COINOTAG. What are memecoins doing to crypto infrastructure? Memecoins are drawing fresh users to blockchains, but the resulting trading volume primarily benefits infrastructure providers—launchpads, DEXs and trading bots—rather than individual traders. Galaxy Research shows these services capture substantial fees and market value while traders face short holding windows and frequent losses. How do launchpads and exchanges profit from memecoin trading? Galaxy Research documents that launchpads and decentralized exchanges monetize token creation and immediate secondary-market trading. For example, Solana’s Pump.fun has facilitated nearly 13 million of the platform’s 32 million tokens and now represents a combined fully diluted market value of about $4.8 billion. Platforms collect primary sale proceeds, listing fees and trading fees. Tools that automate sniping or provide front-running capabilities extract additional revenue from high-frequency activity. Total token sales on Solana. Source: Galaxy Research Why are median hold times collapsing and what does that mean? Median hold times for Solana memecoins dropped to roughly 100 seconds, down from 300 seconds a year earlier. This collapse signals dominance by bots and scalpers that enter and exit positions in seconds to capture micro-profits. Short holding periods reduce retail traders’ ability to capture upside and increase transaction churn, which raises platform fee revenue but concentrates trading gains with sophisticated infrastructure operators. Galaxy Research: “The platform has simply industrialized token creation on Solana.” How concentrated are memecoin revenues? Revenue is highly concentrated among a few service providers. Axiom, a trading platform, reportedly generated over $200 million in fees with fewer than ten employees, according to Galaxy Research. Other automation tools such as BONKbot and Trojan monetize snipe strategies by charging users to access automated token purchase flows. Daily revenue from memecoin infrastructure. Source: Galaxy Research When did Pump.fun scale and what were the headline metrics? Pump.fun emerged in early 2024 and quickly scaled token creation on Solana. On July 12 it launched its token PUMP, raising $500 million in under 12 minutes via an initial sale of 125 billion tokens. Between Aug. 11 and Aug. 17, Pump.fun reportedly generated $13.48 million in revenue, its strongest week since February. Over a recent 30-day window, DefiLlama metrics show Pump.fun generated about $120 million in fees. Cointelegraph reported Pump.fun reached over $1 billion in daily trading volume on Sept. 14, recording $1.02 billion after $942 million the previous day. Frequently Asked Questions Do memecoins create long-term value for retail traders? Evidence indicates most retail traders do not capture lasting profits. The market is short-term and high-frequency, with many users losing money while infrastructure captures fees and automation captures front-run opportunities. How can investors evaluate memecoin-related risks? Assess token utility, distribution, and liquidity. Monitor on-chain metrics and platform fee flows. Recognize that rapid token launches and ultra-short hold times increase execution risk and favor automated trading. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Do memecoins create long-term value for retail traders?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Most retail traders struggle to profit long-term; memecoin markets are dominated by short-term trading, bots and platform fee capture according to Galaxy Research."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How do launchpads and bots capture memecoin revenue?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Launchpads collect primary sale proceeds and fees; exchanges and bots extract trading and snipe fees, concentrating revenue among infrastructure providers."" } } ]} Key Takeaways Memecoins attract users : They bring new participants but often create a short-term gambling market.

The probe centers on whether capital gains were improperly declared tax-exempt after a move to Puerto Rico. Top claim: Pantera founder accused of non-cooperation with Senate tax inquiry Sen. Ron Wyden opened the investigation into use of Puerto Rico residency for tax breaks. Senate alleges potential avoidance of over $100 million in U.S. federal taxes on capital gains. Dan Morehead tax probe: Sen. Wyden says Pantera founder refused to cooperate; learn the investigation details and next steps. Read for facts and official dates. What is the Dan Morehead tax probe? Dan Morehead tax probe is a Senate Finance Committee inquiry led by Sen. Ron Wyden into whether Pantera Capital founder Dan Morehead improperly used Puerto Rico residency to avoid U.S. federal taxes on capital gains. The investigation examines residency timing, tax advice received, and potential noncooperation with Senate subpoenas. How did the Senate start the Pantera Capital tax investigation? The Senate Finance Committee opened a broader probe into how ultra-high net worth individuals use Puerto Rico tax incentives. In January, Sen. Ron Wyden directed inquiries specifically at Dan Morehead’s finances after reports that Puerto Rican residency was claimed ahead of large capital gains events. The committee is requesting documents and testimony to verify residency dates and tax filings. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Sen.

Ron Wyden accuse Dan Morehead of noncooperation? Sen. Ron Wyden wrote that Morehead’s attorneys initially signaled cooperation, but then “have all but disappeared,” raising concerns. Wyden cites questions about whether Morehead declared Puerto Rican residency to shield more than $100 million in capital gains from U.S. taxes. The senator views a lack of timely document production as obstruction to oversight. What are the specific tax issues under review? The committee is focused on three factual elements: residency timing relative to taxable events, the nature of tax advice received, and the interpretation of Puerto Rican tax law regarding new residents. Wyden notes Puerto Rico’s rules can require payment of U.S. taxes for certain transactions within a 10-year period after relocation. Frequently Asked Questions Did Dan Morehead respond to requests for comment? Dan Morehead did not provide a public response when contacted for comment, and the letter from Sen. Wyden states attorneys initially cooperated but then ceased responsive communication. How much tax avoidance does the Senate allege? The Senate letter references potential avoidance of “over $100 million” in federal taxes on capital gains tied to asset sales after the claimed residency shift to Puerto Rico. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is the main allegation against Dan Morehead?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The allegation is that Dan Morehead may have avoided over $100 million in U.S. federal taxes by claiming Puerto Rican residency before realizing large capital gains, and that he has not cooperated fully with the Senate inquiry."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Who is leading the investigation?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The investigation is led by Sen.

Short-term, the probe increases regulatory scrutiny of tax planning among crypto investors and funds. Pantera Capital’s recent moves into asset-backed treasuries and a $1.25 billion initiative to convert a public company position amplify interest in the firm’s tax and corporate structures. Regulators may seek tighter guidance on residency-based tax benefits. What official sources and dates are relevant? Primary points of record include Sen. Ron Wyden’s letter to Dan Morehead and the Senate Finance Committee’s January initiation of the broader Puerto Rico residency review. Relevant public reporting and firm announcements detail Pantera Capital’s corporate activity and investments. Key Takeaways Investigation focus : Whether residency in Puerto Rico was used to avoid U.S. taxes on capital gains. Alleged noncooperation : Sen. Wyden says Morehead’s legal team stopped responding after initial engagement. Industry impact : Increased scrutiny of crypto investor tax strategies and potential legislative or regulatory follow-up. Conclusion The Dan Morehead tax probe centers on alleged misuse of Puerto Rico tax incentives and possible noncooperation with the Senate Finance Committee. The inquiry highlights scrutiny of residency-based tax planning among ultra-high net worth crypto investors.

The U.S. President said that China’s refusal to purchase American crops has created new tension between the world’s two largest economies. The issue has become political ammunition at home, with Republicans from farm-heavy states demanding immediate action. Trump is set to face Xi after the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed that China had not booked any soybean shipments by September 18, the first time since 1999 that Beijing skipped new-season purchases. Last year alone, U.S. shipments made up one-fifth of China’s soybean imports, valued at more than $12 billion. Trump used his social media account on Wednesday to spell out his message. “I’ll be meeting with President Xi, of China, in four weeks, and Soybeans will be a major topic of discussion,” he wrote. “The Soybean Farmers of our Country are being hurt because China is, for ‘negotiating’ reasons only, not buying.” His post triggered a rally in soybean futures, which climbed by as much as 1.9% before trimming gains. The spike marked the sharpest intraday rise since August 21. Farmers and lawmakers had been waiting for such a signal after warning that the standoff was squeezing agricultural communities. Trump pushes Xi as Republicans sound alarms The president blamed Joe Biden for failing to enforce the Phase One trade deal that included a purchase agreement with Beijing during Trump’s first term. He said the previous administration’s inaction gave China space to avoid commitments. At the same time, he floated the idea of using tariff revenue to build a new aid package for farmers. “It’s all going to work out very well. I LOVE OUR PATRIOTS, AND EVERY FARMER IS EXACTLY THAT!” Trump wrote. “MAKE SOYBEANS, AND OTHER ROW CROPS, GREAT AGAIN!” China, the world’s biggest soybean buyer, has been holding back from U.S. imports, repeating the same playbook it used during the first trade war under Trump. The two countries are currently locked in a fragile trade détente that runs out in November. Both sides had lowered tariffs and relaxed export controls under that deal. Earlier this month, Trump and Xi spoke directly to prepare for the APEC meeting, where trade will dominate the face-to-face. Meanwhile, farm-state Republican senators met with U.S. Ambassador to China David Perdue this week and left pessimistic. They said there was no expectation that China would return to U.S. crops soon and warned that a bailout could only offer short-term relief. For lawmakers representing agricultural states, the absence of Chinese purchases has become a pressing problem, and the lack of solutions has left them demanding immediate answers from Trump. Trump faces risks as farmers struggle and courts weigh tariffs The plan to cover farm losses with tariff money could add legal troubles. Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China using emergency powers, but those duties have been struck down by lower courts. If the Supreme Court affirms those rulings, the government could be forced to return tens of billions of dollars in refunds. That outcome would undercut the financial base of any new farm aid package and raise questions about the administration’s next steps. For farmers across the Midwest and other rural regions, the standoff is personal. They backed Trump in 2024, but now their exports have dried up, leaving them exposed as federal safety-net programs shrink. Communities that had relied on global buyers like China are feeling the economic hit as new markets fail to replace lost demand. The second term of Trump has turned into a tough stretch for agriculture, with soybeans at the center of the struggle. The political cost is now becoming clear. With Republicans preparing for next year’s midterm elections, the party risks losing ground in districts that depend on farming.

Individual stocks: HIVE +41% month, CleanSpark +51% month, MARA +16% month (reported figures). Bitcoin miners pivot to high-powered computing to capture AI revenue; learn how market caps rose and what it means for miners. Read the latest analysis. What is driving Bitcoin miners to pivot to high-powered computing? Bitcoin miners are repurposing data center infrastructure to run high-powered computing (HPC) workloads because AI-related demand can offer stable, higher-margin revenue when crypto prices fall. This shift helps operators diversify income, improve utilization rates and justify capital expenditure on power and cooling. How did miner market caps respond to the pivot? Analysts at JP Morgan reported that the combined value of the 14 top publicly traded miners it tracks surpassed $50 billion for the first time.

This shift helped the combined market cap of 14 top public miners pass $50 billion, with notable individual gains at Hive Digital, Marathon Digital (MARA) and CleanSpark (CLSK).""} Why are miners able to run HPC workloads? Mining operations already invest in power, cooling and rack density, which overlap with requirements for HPC and AI inference. Strategic partnerships and equipment upgrades enable miners to host GPU-accelerated tasks or rent idle capacity to compute firms, creating new revenue when block rewards underperform operational costs. Frequently Asked Questions Which miners reported the largest recent stock gains? HIVE Digital rose nearly 9% over the past week and about 41% over the past month. NASDAQ-listed MARA climbed about 8% this week and ~16% over 30 days. CleanSpark surged roughly 51% month-over-month. These figures reflect recent market activity reported alongside the pivot narrative. Can bitcoin miners profit reliably from HPC work? Yes, when contracts and utilization rates are well-managed. Running HPC workloads requires different expertise, and profitability depends on pricing, power costs, and long-term customer commitments. Operators note margins improve when utilization is high and fixed costs are spread across multiple revenue streams. What notable corporate moves support this trend? Google publicly backstopped an arrangement allowing an AI compute provider and a miner to work together, illustrating big-tech interest in securing compute capacity. JP Morgan highlighted these partnerships in its analysis of miner valuations. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Which miners reported the largest recent stock gains?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""HIVE Digital, MARA, and CleanSpark showed notable month-over-month gains, with CleanSpark up ~51% and HIVE up ~41% in the period reported; these moves were tied to investor optimism about HPC pivots."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Can bitcoin miners profit reliably from HPC work?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Profitability is possible but requires new technical capabilities, strong utilization contracts, and competitive power costs.

Execution risk: Transition requires technical upgrades, new contracts and operational expertise; not all miners will succeed. Conclusion The pivot by bitcoin miners to high-powered computing reflects a strategic response to revenue volatility and rising demand for AI compute. With reported gains in market cap and notable stock moves at names like HIVE, MARA and CleanSpark, the sector is in transition. Expect further consolidation and partnership announcements as operators monetize idle capacity and seek durable, multi-revenue models.

The massive buildings filled with computers that power artificial intelligence. The eastern United States grid managed by PJM Interconnection LLC saw power supply expenses jump by $7.3 billion in its most recent auction, with facilities housing AI servers responsible for nearly half of those costs. About 67 million people living in 13 states depend on this grid for their electricity. According to a Wednesday report , these computer facilities made up 45% of total power supply expenses in the summer auction. Looking at the previous auction as well, the buildings contributed roughly two-thirds of record-high prices. Combined, both auctions show these facilities added $16.1 billion in expenses. The situation has become so contentious that Pennsylvania’s governor, Josh Shapiro, suggested his state might withdraw from the regional grid system. Everyday Americans feel the squeeze Kevin Stanley lives in Baltimore, Maryland, more than an hour away from northern Virginia’s concentration of server farms. The 57-year-old relies on disability income and has watched his energy costs surge about 80% compared to three years ago. “They’re going up and up,” Stanley explained to Bloomberg. “You wonder, ‘What is your breaking point?'” His experience reflects a growing problem as these energy-intensive facilities push electricity prices to new heights throughout much of the nation, forcing regular households to shoulder costs tied to digital infrastructure. The enormous buildings require vast amounts of electricity, adding to Americans’ financial strain from already climbing food and housing prices. This is creating both economic and political tension as utilities and community leaders debate how to split up the expenses. However, these same facilities are considered crucial for maintaining American competitiveness in global AI development. Technology corporations, now among the world’s most influential entities, have bet heavily on AI. The facilities, some large enough to cover much of Manhattan, contain endless rows of servers providing the computing capability and storage required to develop and operate AI systems. Energy demands will only grow larger as tech giants double down on AI infrastructure Nvidia Corp. recently announced plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI for new facilities. Microsoft Corp. signed a multiyear agreement valued near $20 billion with Amsterdam-based Nebius Group NV for cloud computing using a New Jersey location. OpenAI and Oracle Corp. created a partnership to construct 4.5 gigawatts of capacity, enough to supply power to millions of American residences. “The reliability crisis is here now; it’s not off in the distance somewhere,” stated Mark Christie, a past chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission who previously worked as a Virginia regulator. He noted that projected power demands, largely driven by requests to connect these facilities to the grid, are a major factor increasing expenses. The cost problem reaches beyond America. Japanese power auction prices reached record levels as officials anticipate an AI expansion, while Malaysia is raising rates for these facilities as new construction strains supply. A report from Aurora Energy Research in the UK projected that increased consumption from these buildings could drive power prices up 9% by 2040. Worldwide, these facilities are projected to use over 4% of electricity by 2035, per BloombergNEF. For perspective: if they were a nation, they would rank fourth globally in electricity consumption, trailing only China, the US and India. In America, power usage from these facilities is expected to double by 2035, reaching nearly 9% of total demand. Some experts predict this will be the largest jump in US energy consumption since air conditioning became widespread in the 1960s. This comes as the grid already faces challenges upgrading old infrastructure and adjusting to climate change. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

XRP Ledger’s XLS-33 MPToken V1 activation introduces a new token standard focused on simplifying asset tokenization and compliance. Multi-Purpose Tokens reduce the need for custom smart contracts, enabling secure and efficient asset tokenization with built-in features. The MPT standard supports a range of institutional DeFi use cases, including fractionalized assets and privacy-preserving transfers. The XRP Ledger has officially activated the XLS-33 MPToken V1 amendment after a 14-day activation window. This activation delivers Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs) , a ledger-native token model designed to make issuance and lifecycle management of tokenized assets simpler and more secure for institutions. The new standard embeds compliance, transfer controls, and metadata into the ledger itself. What is XLS-33 MPToken V1? XLS-33 MPToken V1 is an XRP Ledger protocol amendment that creates Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs) as a first-class ledger feature. MPTs allow issuers to attach compliance rules, metadata, and transfer controls to tokens without deploying custom smart contracts, improving security and operational efficiency. How do Multi-Purpose Tokens change asset tokenization? MPTs shift common token functions to the ledger layer, so financial institutions no longer need to rely on bespoke contract code for basic compliance. The activation followed a 14-day network signaling period and is intended to reduce audit complexity and operational risk. Built-in features include issuer-controlled transfer restrictions, standardized metadata, and optional privacy-preserving transfer modes. The new token standard, Multi Purpose Tokens, just got activated on the XRP Ledger . Let the tokenization of everything enter the next stage! pic.twitter.com/75YaXwjzql — Vet (@Vet_X0) October 1, 2025 MPTs are particularly suited to use cases such as fractionalized real-world assets, tokenized money market funds, closed-loop loyalty tokens, and vault share issuance for lending protocols. By standardizing key features at the ledger level, MPTs enable secondary market activity and introduce pathways for confidential transfers that preserve privacy while maintaining compliance controls. Why are MPTs important for institutional DeFi? MPTs provide the building blocks institutions require to adopt DeFi primitives with predictable governance and compliance. With transfer rules and metadata embedded into the ledger, issuers can create financial products — for example, tokenized funds or vault shares — with lower operational overhead and reduced counterparty risk. This ledger-native approach advances the XRP Ledger’s position as a platform for regulated tokenization and institutional finance. Frequently Asked Questions How quickly did XLS-33 activate on the network? The XLS-33 MPToken V1 amendment activated after a standard 14-day consensus activation period on the XRP Ledger, following node signaling and network readiness checks. Can MPTs replace custom smart contracts entirely? MPTs remove the need for custom smart contracts for common token controls and compliance, but specialized on-chain logic beyond ledger-level features may still require additional smart contract layers or off-ledger processes. Key Takeaways Native tokenization: MPTs embed compliance and control into the XRP Ledger, simplifying issuance workflows. Institutional use cases: Supports fractionalized assets, tokenized funds, vault shares, and privacy-preserving transfers. Operational benefits: Reduces audit and contract complexity, enabling faster, more secure token launches. Conclusion The XLS-33 MPToken V1 activation marks a meaningful step for the XRP Ledger toward standardized, ledger-native asset tokenization. By providing Multi-Purpose Tokens with built-in compliance and metadata, the ledger lowers technical barriers for institutions and accelerates practical DeFi adoption. Expect issuers to pilot fractionalized assets and regulated token products in the coming months as MPT tooling matures.",News|FLOW|XRP,EN,0,0,WALLET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BLOCKCHAIN|FLOW,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-01 22:25:39
52536559,https://cryptonews.com/?p=431204,1759357800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52536559.jpeg,"Perplexity AI Predicts Explosive Gains for XRP, Cardano and Dogecoin by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/perplexity-ai-predicts-explosive-gains-for-xrp-cardano-and-dogecoin-by-the-end-of-2025/,"Perplexity, one of the strongest AI competitors to ChatGPT, forecasts that XRP, Cardano, and Dogecoin could deliver explosive gains much sooner than the market anticipates. Bitcoin, the $2 trillion heavyweight of the crypto sector, is trading only 6% below its record high of $124,128. It rose 3% overnight, in line with a 3% spike in market cap across the $4.09 trillion industry. Historically, October, often nicknamed “Uptober”, has been one of Bitcoin’s best-performing months, increasing the likelihood of fresh all-time highs for many leading projects. At the same time, U.S. lawmakers are helping to accelerate momentum. In July, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first federal law to establish clear stablecoin regulations, requiring full reserve backing. Shortly thereafter, the SEC introduced “Project Crypto,” a policy overhaul designed to align securities laws with the realities of digital assets. With regulatory frameworks falling into place, analysts believe the next altcoin cycle could dwarf the 2021 rally. If Perplexity’s outlook proves correct, XRP, Cardano, and Dogecoin may spearhead the surge. XRP (Ripple): Perplexity AI Sees ~600%+ Surge to $20 According to Perplexity’s models, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could reach as high as $24 by late 2025, representing a 580% rise from its current level near $2.94. Source: Perplexity AI This year, XRP has already demonstrated considerable strength. On July 18, it touched $3.65, breaking past its 2018 high of $3.40, before retreating around 20% due to global macroeconomic and political headwinds. Ripple continues expanding its cross-border payments network worldwide, with growing institutional recognition. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund endorsed XRP as a cost-efficient remittance solution for developing economies. The token also secured a major regulatory win. In early 2025, the SEC officially dropped its lawsuit after a 2023 ruling determined that retail sales of XRP were not securities. Perplexity suggests that a decisive move above the July high could set a target of $5.50 by year-end at the very least, while a bullish breakout could see XRP push toward $7–$20. Over the last year, XRP has gained 366%, outshining Bitcoin’s 82% advance and performing six times better than Ethereum’s 63%. Technical indicators are also flashing bullish signs, with three bullish flags throughout the year hinting at a potential breakout in Q4. Although markets have so far been muted in response to Fed rate cuts and the first spot XRP ETF, upcoming ETF rulings and new crypto legislation could be powerful catalysts. Cardano ($ADA): Perplexity AI Predicts Threefold Growth in Three Months Cardano ($ADA) has been regaining visibility, largely due to its reputation as a credible Ethereum alternative, which means that, like its biggest rivals, Ethereum and Solana, it is constantly onboarding new developers and use cases. Founded by Ethereum co-creator Charles Hoskinson, Cardano stands out for its peer-reviewed development model and strong focus on sustainability, scalability, and scientific research. With a market value exceeding $30.6 billion, Cardano is establishing itself as a serious competitor to Ethereum and narrowing the gap with Solana in adoption. Perplexity projects ADA could climb to between $1.88 and $2.50 by the end of 2025. In the best-case scenario, that’s a threefold increase in three months from its current $0.8384. From a charting perspective, ADA has been consolidating in a descending wedge since late 2024, facing resistance around $1.10. A strong “Uptober” rally could push ADA substantially towards $2 in Q4, but a full-scale bull market would be required for it to notch the higher targets. The $2.50 forecast implies that Perplexity isn’t sold on the possibility of ADA surpassing its 2021 peak of $3.09, achievable only if adoption accelerates under a favorable U.S. regulatory regime. Dogecoin ($DOGE): AI Predicts Long-Awaited $1 Milestone Dogecoin ($DOGE) , originally created in 2013 as a joke, has grown into a top-10 digital asset with a $36.7 billion valuation in the $78 billion meme coin market. Its success is driven by a loyal community and increasing use as a payment token. Although often correlated with Bitcoin’s movements, Dogecoin’s high liquidity and strong retail backing have allowed it to survive multiple market downturns. Now priced at $0.2429, DOGE has more than doubled over the past year, outpacing Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Shiba Inu, and Pepe. The RSI is also in the neutral zone of 50 and climbing, suggesting meme fans are buying back in. In the last 24 hours, Doge has risen 5.4%, outperforming the top cryptos, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, which all rose by around 3%. Technical charts have repeatedly shown bullish falling wedge patterns between late 2024 and mid-2025, pointing to the potential for a significant breakout. Perplexity projects DOGE could finish the year between $0.25 and $0.42. Hitting the upper end would still mean it’s trading 43% short of its 2021 ATH of $0.7316. However, adoption is generally growing: Tesla continues to accept DOGE for merchandise, while payment platforms like PayPal and Revolut now support Dogecoin transfers. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A High-Risk Meme Coin Alternative Outside of its top picks, Perplexity notes rising interest in Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a speculative meme token branding itself as Dogecoin’s “amped-up cousin.” It’s designed for traders chasing high-volatility low-market cap plays, along with fun degen community building. Unlike Dogecoin, which has evolved into a more established large-cap asset, Maxi Doge is leaning into meme culture and hype cycles. Since launch, it has already raised over $2.6 million in a matter of weeks. Built on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, MAXI emphasizes community-driven growth, leveraging Telegram and Discord campaigns, trading competitions, and upcoming collaborations. Out of its 150.24 billion supply, 25% goes to a “Maxi Fund” for marketing and partnerships. Staking has gone live, offering yields up to 128% APY, though rates will decrease as participation rises. Currently, presale tokens are $0.00026, with gradual increases as the presale moves into future funding rounds. Investors can buy through the Maxi Doge website using wallets such as MetaMask or Best Wallet . Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

Bitcoin remains about 7% below its all-time high (ATH) of $124,128, recorded mid-August. However, its dominance is waning as investor enthusiasm shifts toward high-performing altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which have hit fresh records within the past year. This renewed optimism stems largely from two landmark policy changes in Washington. President Trump recently signed the GENIUS Act, the first U.S. law focused solely on stablecoin regulation. Shortly afterward, the SEC unveiled “Project Crypto,” a major modernization push to bring securities regulations into alignment with digital assets. With sentiment recovering, traders are keeping close tabs on XRP, Pepe, and Pi Network as the best crypto dip-buying opportunities ahead of what could be the next bullish cycle. Ripple ($XRP): Dominating Global Crypto Payments and Best Poised to Lead 2025’s Altcoin Rally Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) hit a record high of $3.65 on July 18 this year, right as the GENIUS Act passed into law. It was the first sign of movement for holders after seven years trading below its 2018 all-time high (ATH) of $3.40, five of which were marred by a high-profile SEC lawsuit. Today it trades around $2.94, or 20% below the peak. XRP’s edge comes from its fast, low-cost cross-border payment network, making it a modern alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. Its credibility has grown with recognition from the UN Capital Development Fund and wider U.S. financial adoption. Ripple’s policy clout was underscored earlier this year when CEO Brad Garlinghouse joined a White House roundtable on crypto. The rollout of RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin, highlights its push into the rapidly growing stablecoin market. Momentum also accelerated after a pivotal 2023 court ruling confirmed XRP’s retail sales were not securities, an important victory in its long battle with the SEC. Over the past 12 months, XRP has soared 366%, easily outpacing Bitcoin’s still-strong 82% gains. After peaking in July, it found support near $3 before sliding during the September downturn. Currently, XRP’s RSI sits near 51 and is trending higher, suggesting more upside in the short term. Even though Fed rate cuts and the debut of the first spot XRP ETF at the end of last month didn’t spark a breakout, the presence of three bullish flag patterns on the charts, combined with upcoming ETF rulings expected in mid-October, could propel XRP up to $7 by the New Year. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Token Star Still Brimming With Growth Potential Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) quickly rose to become one of the top meme coins by market cap, taking inspiration from Matt Furie’s legendary frog meme. Its meteoric rise triggered a flood of imitators, though none matched its success. Now capitalizing a little over $4 billion of crypto’s $4.09 trillion market cap, Pepe has captured worldwide attention, even Elon Musk briefly adopted its logo as his X profile picture. Currently trading at around $0.000009621, PEPE is down 66% from its late-2024 high of $0.00002803, as broader macroeconomic headwinds dragged on crypto markets through most of the summer. Still, October has historically been a strong month for digital assets, and if the “Uptober” trend repeats, Pepe could be challenging new highs by November, with analysts pointing to possible 3.5× returns by 2026. At present, its RSI sits near 44 and climbing, signaling people are buying back in, so the price could well be significantly higher next week. Supporters believe that a friendlier macro environment and improving investor confidence could drive PEPE into uncharted price levels later this year. Pi Network ($PI): Can the Mobile Mining Pioneer Regain Strength Before Year’s End? Pi Network revolutionized mining by introducing a tap-to-earn model that democratizes crypto mining by eliminating the need for energy-intensive rigs or big stakes. With users able to mine tokens through simply opening the app daily and tapping, Pi dramatically lowered the barrier to entry, allowing newcomers to participate in crypto without technical hurdles. Since May, Pi’s RSI has risen from below 30 to around 34, a bullish sign suggesting traders are buying the recent dip. The team is currently rolling out major upgrades, transitioning the network from version 19 to version 23, a critical step toward the long-awaited mainnet launch. For long-term believers, this cooldown phase may present a strategic buying opportunity. A falling wedge pattern spotted earlier this year suggests a possible breakout by December. If market sentiment turns positive, Pi could push back above $1.50 before November ends, which would be a seven-month high. Thanks to its easy-to-use interface and proprietary Layer 1 blockchain, Pi is well-positioned to capture adoption in the next wave of crypto expansion. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): How a Bitcoin Layer 2 Became One of 2025’s Best Crypto Presales Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is emerging as a standout presale heading into 2025, blending Bitcoin’s security with Layer 2 scaling solutions while tapping into meme culture and decentralized governance. Its vision: unlock Bitcoin’s full potential by enabling faster payments, smart contracts, and community-driven decision-making. The presale has already attracted more than $19.5 million, with analysts projecting post-launch gains of 10× or more. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER delivers low-cost smart contracts, instant Bitcoin transfers through a Canonical Bridge, and full support for dApps, meme tokens, and payment systems. A recent Coinsult audit found no vulnerabilities, strengthening investor trust. HYPER tokens fuel the ecosystem via staking, governance rights, and transaction fees. Early investors are currently earning up to 6% APY in staking rewards, with voting rights to go live once governance is activated.

Wyden's probe into whether Morehead committed tax evasion began in January, and is focused on how the Pantera founder reported taxes on his share of proceeds after a large crypto sale by the firm. According to a press release , Wyden is specifically looking at whether Morehead ""misrepresent[ed] his residency status"" when Pantera generated over $1 billion in capital gains from crypto sales by claiming his profits from the sale came while he was in Puerto Rico. Residents of the U.S. territory do not pay income tax on capital gains. ""It is my understanding your share of these gains … was hundreds of millions of dollars,"" Wyden said in the letter , sent on Wednesday. ""It is also my understanding that you treated the entire [gain] as exempt from U.S. tax, even though the lion’s share of these gains accrued while you still resided in California. These are serious allegations of potential abuse of Puerto Rico tax incentives to avoid the payment of U.S. taxes that you must immediately address."" Wyden's letter alleged that Morehead's attorneys ""have all but disappeared"" despite initially engaging with his staff. He also said in the letter that he believes Morehead was advised by Jeffrey Rubinger, a Miami-based attorney who advised another client who ""recently pled guilty to a tax fraud scheme"" tied to the same Puerto Rico tax rules. A Pantera spokesperson referred CoinDesk to a previous statement from Morehead, when he told the New York Times in a statement earlier this year that, ""I believe I acted appropriately with respect to my taxes."" Wyden's probe does not carry the full weight of an investigation by the Senate Finance Committee at the moment, given Democrats are the minority party in the Senate and committee Chair Mike Crapo — the top Republican on the committee — does not appear to have joined in the inquiry at this time. Wyden's letter came the same day the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on crypto tax issues specifically. Witnesses at the hearing warned that the IRS may soon face a deluge of tax reporting.

Six spot XRP ETF issuers face their final decision deadline in October, as potential new touchpoints for TradFi markets to gain exposure to the altcoin . XRP ETF DECISIONS COMING THIS OCTOBER! There are 6 companies awaiting SEC decisions on $XRP ETFs starting from the 2nd week of October. pic.twitter.com/vXAEZwZHEY — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) September 30, 2025 The lineup spans from straightforward spot funds to leveraged and short products, with proposed assets under management ranging from millions to over $100 billion. While these figures don’t represent guaranteed inflows, they reflect the scale of demand that could be unlocked as TradFi on-ramps into XRP, particularly as the U.S macro narrative heats up. With inflation nearing the Fed’s 2% target, hopes for continued interest rate easing are growing, with the potential to stimulate new demand for risk assets like XRP. XRP Price Prediction: Could Fresh ETF Demand Push XRP over $10? These potential inflows could give XRP the fuel it needs to realise the breakout of a 10-month cup-and-handle pattern now nearing its apex. A triple bottom has developed along the handle’s lower boundary at $2.70, a strong reversal structure that positions the latest bounce as the start of a breakout move. XRP / USD 1-day chart, cup-and-handle nears apex. Source: TradingView. Momentum indicators reinforce this outlook. The RSI has reclaimed the neutral line, indicating that buyers are driving the current market move. The MACD histogram shows a similar potential trend shift, on the verge of a golden cross above the signal line. This setup on the daily suggests the recent bounce may spark a wider uptrend. The key threshold for a confirmed breakout sits around $3.60 . Once flipped to support, the cup-and-handle pattern can realise its full breakout momentum. While $100 bullion inflows would only account for a 56% rise, the pattern eyes a much larger 165% move to $7.50. And with U.S. interest rate cuts fuelling demand across U.S. investment markets with greater TradFi exposure, a continued bull run into 2026 could extend to $15 for a 430% gain . This New ICO Can Secure Steady Gains, Bull Market or Not For a large altcoin like XRP, big breakouts are rare. Holders have been waiting over 8 years for a new all-time high. Some coins like PEPENODE offer bigger potential gains in the short term. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) lets you build virtual mining rigs to earn meme coins – no hardware needed. It’s the first mine-to-earn project of its kind, turning presale participation into an interactive mining experience. Buyers can set up digital nodes, stack rigs, and start generating rewards even before the token officially launches.

The pair is pressing into a long-standing demand shelf between $0.00000850 and $0.00001183, a band that has repeatedly arrested declines since 2022 and underpinned the market’s extended sideways structure. The zone is highlighted as the market’s “make-or-break” area: hold here and the path opens to a multi-leg advance; lose it and the structure degrades into a deeper drawdown. Key Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Levels Structurally, the macro picture remains defined by lower highs from the all-time peak, which continues to signal longer-term seller control. That said, the persistence of bids inside the $0.00000850–$0.00001183 box speaks to ongoing accumulation. The 6-day candles have compressed into a progressively tighter range, a classic volatility contraction that typically precedes expansion. With range width narrowing and tests of the same support recurring, the next directional move is likely to be sharp. On the topside, the first pivot is $0.00001580. CryptoNuclear frames this level as the initial breakout trigger on a 6-day closing basis, with volume confirmation required to validate impulsive intent. A decisive close above would expose a stair-step series of upside references at $0.00001940, $0.00002400, and $0.00003338, each corresponding to prior supply within last year’s distribution. Related Reading: Why Shiba Inu Price Could Explode 100% With This Descending Pattern On The 2D Chart Beyond those intermediate shelves sits a larger supply cluster at $0.00007870–$0.00008836, marked on the chart as the “High” band; in the event of a macro reversal, that zone could act as a longer-horizon magnet where profit-taking would be expected. Failure to defend the accumulation base flips the script. A breakdown through $0.00000850, especially on expanding volume, would invalidate the range thesis and shift focus to $0.00000543, annotated as the “Low” on CryptoNuclear’s chart and the next meaningful liquidity pocket below. Acceptance beneath that threshold would increase the risk of capitulation dynamics and the formation of new cycle lows, given the lack of dense historical trading in between. Market positioning follows naturally from the map. Optimistic dip-buyers view the $0.00000850–$0.00001183 area as value and a favorable risk-to-reward location, provided the market can reclaim and hold above $0.00001580 to convert resistance into support and sustain a trend continuation sequence. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Exchange Reserves Fall Below $1 Billion Amid Withdrawal Spree, What This Means For Price Cautious participants see symmetrical risk: the same compression that fuels breakouts can fuel breakdowns, and a daily-to-weekly close beneath the floor would argue for defense first. Neutral traders remain patient, waiting for confirmation via a 6-day close beyond either $0.00001580 or $0.00000850 before committing size. In sum, SHIB is coiled at a historically significant base that is likely to determine the asset’s macro path into 2025–2026. Respecting support keeps the recovery track intact toward $0.00001940, $0.00002400, and $0.00003338, with a more ambitious runway into the $0.00007870–$0.00008836 supply envelope if momentum broadens. Losing the base hands control back to sellers with $0.00000543 as the first downside checkpoint. For investors and swing traders alike, the $0.00000850–$0.00001183 zone—and the reaction around $0.00001580 overhead—are the levels to watch. At press time, SHIB traded at $0.00001231.

According to Ramos, upcoming U.S. events may create short-term uncertainty, but he believes the bigger picture still supports a recovery for XRP. He adds that patient investors who hold or accumulate could benefit the most in the long run. Ramos Says October Could Be A Turning Point For XRP Ramos points out that big investors and high-profile market players are already preparing for favorable conditions, such as the potential approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), while many retail investors remain cautious. He explains that while the price is in a narrow band for weeks, such periods of stability often create the groundwork for a significant shift. He compares the current situation to pressure building quietly, waiting for the right spark to release, and investors should not mistake calmness for weakness. Ramos also notes that XRP has been in a prolonged period of sideways trading. The price briefly moved above $3.60 but has remained mostly within a narrow range for over two months. He admits the token has underperformed since its all-time high of $3.65 in July, but he sees this calm period as a sign that a bigger move may be close . To him, buying XRP under $3 is a long-term investment that would be foolish to overlook. Short-term drops could happen, but Ramos argues the overall setup points upward . For this reason, he keeps a clear view that XRP holders who stay patient could benefit once the market breaks out of this extended calm. Fed Policy And Regulation Add To Bullish Outlook Ramos also links XRP’s next move to events in the United States. The Fed already cut interest rates, and Ramos says people are waiting for more signals from Chair Jerome Powell and other officials. He reminds XRP investors that these updates can move the market, even if they sometimes provide little new direction. Ramos also warns about possible disruption from U.S. government budget talks. According to him, the risk of a shutdown is something to “brace yourself a little bit” for, but he adds that leaders should resolve the issue. Speeches from Federal Reserve officials, along with new data on jobs, housing, and consumer confidence, which he says could shape investor sentiment in the coming weeks. For the longer horizon, Ramos explains that regulatory clarity and the arrival of Central Bank Digital Currencies remain critical milestones, although they may not arrive until 2026. In the meantime, institutional attention on exchange-traded funds is becoming a more immediate driver. By combining these short-term events with the bigger regulatory picture, Ramos believes investors have good reason to expect brighter days for XRP , with October marking the beginning of that shift.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BUSINESS|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 23:00:43

The automakers said the discounts are meant to keep EV sales from plunging after a record third quarter. They are also trying to clear existing inventories of electric cars that were ordered before the credit ran out. Ford and GM are extending the full $7,500 discount on leased EVs that are already on dealer lots or in transit to showrooms. Hyundai is applying the rebate more broadly. The company is offering $7,500 cash on both purchases and leases of the 2025 Ioniq 5, and it is also cutting the sticker price of the 2026 Ioniq 5 by as much as $9,800, depending on the trim level. All of this is being paid for directly by Hyundai rather than the federal government. Trump policy changes slow EV market and raise costs The companies warned that EV sales will slow in the coming months as President Donald Trump’s administration rolls out policies aimed at encouraging gasoline and hybrid models instead of battery-only vehicles. Automakers are adjusting production plans and preparing to offer more non-electric cars as demand for full battery-electric vehicles cools. Many American buyers are still staying away from EVs because of high prices and unreliable charging networks. “I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the US go down to 5% from about 10% now,” Jim Farley, the chief executive officer of Ford, said at a conference in Detroit this week. Farley also said the EV market will be “way smaller than we thought.” Automakers are already dealing with higher costs as Trump’s new trade deals impose tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts. Based on research from Cox Automotive, those tariffs could add $5,500 to the price of an imported vehicle and $1,000 even to U.S.-built cars that use foreign components. A September forecast from EY, a consulting arm of Ernst & Young Global, showed the U.S. EV market only reaching 11% of new car sales by 2029, up from 8.1% last year. Europe and China are far ahead. EY expects Europe’s EV share to pass 50% by 2032 and China’s to pass 50% by 2033. This gap is shaping how different carmakers approach their product plans. Hyundai funds rebates as GM locks in federal credits pre-deadline Hyundai is also retooling its $5.5 billion plant in Savannah, Georgia to build both hybrid and electric models for the U.S. market. “Because of the surge we saw in September, there’s going to be a reset in October, maybe November. But the EV market will settle,” said Randy Parker, Hyundai’s North America chief executive. Parker added, “There was an EV market before the IRA and there’s gonna be an EV market after the IRA,” referring to President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which created the now-expired tax credit. Hyundai said it is using its own funds to finance the $7,500 cash rebate on the 2025 Ioniq 5 and the discounts on the 2026 models. Parker said this shows Hyundai’s ability to operate “with a lot of uncertainty.” GM and Ford are taking a different path. GM Financial placed down payments on about 30,000 EVs before October 1 to secure the tax credit ahead of time. This allows GM to lease the vehicles with the $7,500 credit already included in the price. Once a lease is written, the Internal Revenue Service reimburses GM Financial. Ford Credit is running a similar plan, saying in a statement it will provide “competitive lease payments on retail leases through Ford Credit until Dec. 31.” Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",Tech|ford|General Motors|Hyundai,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING|ASIA,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-01 23:17:05

Hill’s nomination has been received in the Senate and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, according to a congressional website. If approved, the government’s role will be in effect for a five-year term. The nomination of Hill, who has been advocating for crypto-friendly banking policies, comes as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unveiled its rulemaking agenda for the upcoming month. These regulations could lead to broad proposals to revamp cryptocurrency regulations and reduce rules that Wall Street has decried as overly burdensome. The regulator formally outlined several of its initiatives to overhaul cryptocurrency policies, which SEC Chair Paul Atkins had previewed in July. Those include proposing rules regarding the offer and sale of digital assets, which the SEC said could include certain exemptions and safe harbors, as well as clarifying how its broker-dealer rules apply to cryptocurrency. Hill pushes FDIC toward pro-crypto rules as SEC eyes digital asset reforms According to congressional records, Trump’s nomination of Travis as FDIC chair was sent to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday. Initially, he served as a senior adviser to then-FDIC Chairman Jelena McWilliams during Trump’s first term. Before taking up his role at the FDIC, Hill stated that the department should offer additional guidance on digital assets and tokenization. He also pushed back on allegations of US authorities debanking companies due to their ties to crypto. In March, he wrote a letter aimed at financial institutions, clarifying that banks could engage with digital assets as a ”permissible activity.” “I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto- and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards,” Hill said. Meanwhile, the SEC has indicated that it is considering amending its rules to permit the trading of cryptocurrencies on national securities exchanges and alternative trading systems. If enacted, those policies would represent a major win for the digital asset industry, which has long pushed for tailored rules that would enable crypto to become more enmeshed with traditional finance. “This regulatory agenda reflects that it is a new day at the Securities and Exchange Commission,” Atkins said in a statement. “The items on the agenda represent the commission’s renewed focus on supporting innovation, capital formation, market efficiency, and investor protection.” Trump moves to reboot US crypto policy with key regulatory nominations Hill succeeds Martin Gruenberg, the previous Senate-confirmed FDIC chair, who resigned in January as part of the outgoing Biden administration. While Trump has announced several nominations that could shape US crypto policy, including Hill, key positions at major financial regulators remain vacant. This includes a potential replacement for Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chair Brian Quintenz and a Democratic commissioner’s seat at the SEC, which has been vacant since January. On the campaign trail last year, President Donald Trump courted the crypto community by pledging to be a “crypto president” and promote the adoption of digital assets. This stance contrasts sharply with the approach of former Democratic President Joe Biden’s regulators, who cracked down on the industry to curb fraud and money laundering. Under the Biden administration, the SEC filed lawsuits against exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance, along with dozens of others, alleging violations of US laws—cases that the Trump administration’s SEC has since dropped. The SEC also plans to propose a “rationalization” of disclosure requirements, a core part of the agency’s work aimed at increasing transparency and reducing risk for investors. Additionally, the agency has flagged plans to ease compliance burdens for public companies, particularly regarding shareholder proposals.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/crypto-veteran-says-its-time-to-sell-xrp-heres-why/,"A senior figure in the XRP community has urged investors to consider selling after Ripple’s long-time Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, announced he will step back from day-to-day responsibilities. According to Schwartz, a core architect of the XRP Ledger, he’ll transition to a scaled-back operational role at the end of the year and continue serving on Ripple’s board as an advisor. Schwartz’s Departure and Plans In his statement, Schwartz confirmed he intends to relinquish daily CTO duties but will continue to support XRP-related work in a less active capacity. He said he plans to remain on Ripple’s board as CTO Emeritus and will pursue independent development projects tied to the ledger. Schwartz described a desire to devote more time to hands-on engineering, experimentation, and personal priorities after more than a decade with the company. Messages of gratitude and respect for Schwartz’s technical contributions appeared across social channels immediately after the announcement. Many community members praised his role in building the ledger’s foundation and wished him success in his new endeavors. At the same time, the news has introduced uncertainty for some stakeholders who associate long-term stability with existing leadership. ALERT Time to sell $XRP 1) CTO stepping down to “research other use cases for XRP” (besides what Ripple is focused on)” 2) We’re at the stage where they start to openly admit failure 3) This comes at a critical time where SWIFT announced partnership with CONSENSUS https://t.co/ZnFhpHKoE6 — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) September 30, 2025 Exit Call from a Prominent Investor Reacting to the announcement, high-profile investor and early XRP backer Crypto Bitlord publicly recommended reducing XRP holdings. He argued that Schwartz’s change in responsibilities arrived during a period of heightened competition and pointed to recent industry moves by major incumbents as evidence that Ripple’s position faces fresh challenges. Bitlord criticized Ripple’s revenue profile, noting the company’s historical reliance in part on token sales rather than recurring cash flows from diversified product lines. He suggested that this business model raises vulnerability as institutional actors expand their own solutions. In a blunt assessment, the investor framed Schwartz’s new board role as consistent with corporate preparations for a potential public listing, rather than a guaranteed benefit for XRP token holders. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Shifts and Competition Observers have tied this leadership transition to wider shifts in the payments infrastructure landscape. The timing follows announcements from established financial networks that are accelerating blockchain integration and exploring proprietary ledger solutions in partnership with enterprise technology firms. Some analysts contend these developments reduce the likelihood that institutions will adopt an external public ledger as their primary settlement layer. Critics argue that the narrative claiming XRP will replace existing players overlooks the fact that major banks and payment networks typically want to maintain control over their own systems. That preference has informed recent industry projects that prioritize interoperability between legacy rails and tokenized assets while preserving institutional control. Community Sentiment Reactions within the XRP ecosystem remain mixed. While many supporters expressed appreciation for Schwartz’s continued involvement and welcomed his plans to return to technical work, other participants interpreted the move as a potential inflection point that warrants a reassessment of holdings and strategy. Schwartz emphasized that his decision is personal and that he intends to stay engaged with the ledger’s technical progress. He also expressed interest in exploring independent projects that could expand the XRPL’s applications beyond Ripple’s commercial activities. David Schwartz’s announcement marks a notable leadership change for a project closely associated with his technical leadership. While the transition has prompted some investors to recommend exiting positions, others view the shift as an opportunity for renewed technical innovation led by Schwartz himself. The long-term implications for XRP will depend on how Ripple, institutional partners, and independent developers respond to changing market dynamics and the CTO’s new focus on engineering and experimentation.

Regarding its Vision Pro headset, the tech giant was working on a lighter, more affordable version of its headset, called the N100. This version was set to be introduced in 2027. However, after several considerations, reports from sources with knowledge of the situation revealed that Apple instructed its staff to pause this project and focus on ways to accelerate the development of smart glasses. Tech firms explore the development of AI-related devices amid the AI boom era The adoption of AI technology continues to expand within tech companies. This has triggered a growing trend among these firms to develop devices focused on this technology. An example of the gadgets developed is smart glasses, which have sparked a fierce competition among tech rivals. Interestingly, like smart glasses, future designs could become just as significant as mobile phones, and Apple aims to be prepared for that. Concerning its project on smart glasses, the tech giant is targeting to create at least two types of these glasses. To begin with, the first version is known as N50. The model will link up with an iPhone, but it will not have its own screen. The company plans to showcase this model by next year, before its launch, which is set for 2027, according to sources familiar with the situation who wished to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the situation. The other version, which has a display, might compete with the recently released Meta Ray-Ban Display. To demonstrate the stiff competition in the tech ecosystem, insiders with knowledge of the matter revealed that this version was initially intended to be launched in 2028. Still, Apple aims to launch it earlier by accelerating its development. In the meantime, it is worth noting that even with this shift in priorities, the tech giant still lags behind Meta. To illustrate, Meta introduced its first smart glasses called Ray-Ban Stories in 2021, followed by a surprise success known as the Ray-Ban Meta in 2023. Meta solidifies its position as the leader in the tech space with the launch of smart glasses In September, Meta made several updates to its regular glasses. This included the installation of improved cameras, long-lasting batteries, and new designs specifically designed for athletes. For Meta, smart glasses have enabled it to expand its presence in the devices market. Notably, the tech company has had mixed results in hardware technology. On the other hand, Apple’s coming glasses will rely on voice commands and artificial intelligence, two areas where it has not always excelled. Earlier, the company lagged in releasing its Apple Intelligence platform and was forced to delay updates of Siri, its voice assistant. Despite facing significant challenges, Apple continues to make efforts to improve the situation. The company is pinning its hopes on a redesign of Siri, due as early as March, to drive its new line of devices like glasses, speakers, displays, and cameras. Other technology titans have their own ideas about the wave of devices to come. Amazon and Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., are vying to enter consumers’ homes with other AI-powered hardware. For instance, ChatGPT’s maker, OpenAI, enlisted former Apple design expert Jony Ive to help create sleek new gadgets.

Co-founder Dominic Ryder described his project’s new Ethereum-based standard, ERC-7621, as the “Basket Token Standard” (BTS). It allows real estate, commodities, and multiple ERC-20 tokens to be packaged into investment baskets, much like index funds. Ryder envisions Alvara becoming the “Fidelity of tokenized assets,” opening the door for venture capital firms to create products like distressed “value baskets” or elite “all-star baskets.” Most people just trade assets. With Alvara, the portfolio itself can become the product. Mint a basket → earn fees → build a record. And if you want out? Sell the entire strategy.

Broader adoption of tokenized funds indirectly strengthens Bitcoin’s position as the market’s most trusted digital asset, encouraging institutional involvement and expanding blockchain’s reach. Metaplanet Climbs to Fourth-Largest BTC Holder Institutional appetite for Bitcoin is also accelerating. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet recently added 5,268 BTC worth roughly $600 million, bringing its total holdings to 30,823 BTC. At today’s price of $118,353, the stash is valued at $3.6 billion, giving the firm an unrealized profit of about 7.5% based on its average cost near $108,000.

They are now the 4th largest publicly traded Bitcoin treasury company pic.twitter.com/rsuJcIn9dd — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 1, 2025 Metaplanet’s aggressive strategy, launched in April 2024, has quickly made it the fourth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Its growing presence adds further pressure to Bitcoin’s limited supply, reinforcing the narrative of BTC as a treasury asset and supporting long-term price appreciation. U.S. Lawmakers Revisit Crypto Taxation Rules In Washington, lawmakers are shifting tone on digital asset taxes. The U.S. Senate Finance Committee will hold a hearing on crypto taxation following fresh IRS guidance easing the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT). The rule change allows companies to exclude unrealized crypto gains and losses from CAMT calculations, offering relief to major holders like Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which owns more than 640,000 BTC. Policy experts from Coinbase and Coin Center are expected to testify. The move could ease selling pressure on corporate treasuries and foster more stable long-term confidence in Bitcoin. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Breakout Targets $124K Technically, Bitcoin has staged a decisive breakout, climbing above $118,000 and breaking through a descending trendline that capped rallies since mid-September. A bullish engulfing candle on the 4-hour chart, combined with heavy trading volume, underscores renewed buyer conviction. Price has reclaimed both the 50-day SMA at $112,037 and the 100-day SMA at $113,395, now key support levels. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The RSI sits above 80, suggesting strong demand but also short-term overbought conditions. A retest of the $116,950 breakout zone may occur before the next leg higher. If momentum holds, Bitcoin could test $120,200, then $122,335, and ultimately $124,525 — resistance that capped rallies earlier this year. Traders eyeing entries may look for pullbacks toward $117,000–$117,500, with upside potential extending toward $128,000 in the weeks ahead. This breakout not only highlights renewed technical strength but also dovetails with growing institutional demand and favorable regulatory shifts, setting the stage for a potentially stronger Bitcoin rally into year-end. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining BTC’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $19.4 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.013005—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses. You can buy HYPER tokens on the official Bitcoin Hyper website using crypto or a bank card.

52539939,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/xrp-consolidates-after-24h-red-as-solana-leads-altcoin-correction-analysts-still-eye-bull-season/,1759363140,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52539939.jpeg,XRP Consolidates After 24h Red As Solana Leads Altcoin Correction – Analysts Still Eye Bull Season,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/xrp-consolidates-after-24h-red-as-solana-leads-altcoin-correction-analysts-still-eye-bull-season/,"After a red 24-hour period, XRP has settled into a consolidation zone, stabilizing near $2.84 . While the pullback erased short-term gains, analysts argue it is part of a broader reset rather than a reversal. Meanwhile, Solana has led the correction among altcoins, shedding momentum after weeks of steady growth. Together, the two assets illustrate a familiar cycle: majors absorb selling pressure before setting up the next leg upward. Despite the dip, many traders remain convinced that the market is still shaping up for a bullish season, with consolidation seen as healthy preparation. For retail investors, however, corrections feel very different. Patience is difficult, and dips often push traders to rotate into fresh narratives. In Telegram groups and across X, discussions are already shifting from short-term red candles to longer-term opportunities. While XRP and Solana remain anchors in many portfolios, the speculative buzz is building elsewhere. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now appearing as one of the most mentioned tokens in retail conversations, a reminder that even during corrections, retail is hungry for asymmetric upside. XRP Stays Steady Despite Pressure XRP’s consolidation is a testament to its staying power. The token has survived through historical battles with regulators, prolonged legal cases, and dramatic sell-offs, only to endure among leading assets. The analysts note that its cross-border settlement use case provides an institutional basis to the token, even while the price action is disappointing. The consolidation now appears to be evidence of the strongest of hands riding out the storm, anticipating clearer directions. Whale tracking shows that there is steady activity, with big investors still buying when prices drop. This confidence shows that while regular traders often get scared, whales see consolidation as a chance to buy. Solana Leads The Correction Solana’s steeper pullback reinforces its position as a high-beta cryptocurrency. Profit-taking and liquidations have restored volatility after several weeks of strength. Investors who took entry during recent uplegs were caught out by the decline, but analysts don’t find this surprising. Solana has always paired dramatic growth with matching correction. Even though there was a decline, developer activity and ecosystem expansion continue to be healthy. Solana continues to fund NFT projects, DeFi initiatives, and meme coins to make sure that it’s still important within tech and culture. Long-term holders will see this correction as another buying chance and not a trend reversal. Experts Still Look to Bull Season Even with red candles, however, experts remain optimistic. Consolidative phases regularly precede higher prices, and markets reset their leverage to make better foundations. The bigger picture — increased institution involvement, ETF advances, and further uses of blockchain — all appears very bright. Analysts warn that corrections are a normal part of the process. They remove weaker investors and give large investors and institutions chances to buy more. This pattern has happened in every cycle, and current feelings suggest it will probably happen again. XRP’s consolidation and Solana’s correction haven’t shaken analysts’ belief in an upcoming bull season. Many now point to presales as the vehicles that can turn small positions into generational wealth opportunities . MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly described as one of those rare setups, blending unique branding with scarcity mechanics. For long-term investors, it represents the high-risk slice of a portfolio that could deliver outsized impact if momentum compounds. Comparisons are being drawn to early DOGE and SHIB allocations, where small risks transformed into cycle-defining wins. While XRP and SOL remain central to the bull thesis, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being discussed as the speculative piece that could reshape individual portfolios in the years ahead. Retail Psychology During Corrections The popularity of MAGACOIN FINANCE during altcoin pullbacks highlights retail psychology. Corrections test patience, and many smaller investors prefer to rotate into presales or meme-driven projects where growth feels faster. This isn’t necessarily irrational — it reflects different goals. Institutions prioritize stability, while retail seeks transformative outcomes. By offering both legitimacy through audits and excitement through scarcity-driven design, MAGACOIN FINANCE has positioned itself perfectly for retail investors during consolidation phases. It gives traders a sense of action when majors are standing still. How to Plan Before The Next Bull Leg The ongoing correction may frustrate short-term traders, but smart portfolios are built during these moments. Balancing Ethereum, XRP, and Solana with speculative exposure to projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE ensures resilience and optionality. When the next bull leg begins, portfolios structured this way capture both the institutional flow into majors and the retail surge into speculative names. Whales already appear to be adopting this strategy, quietly accumulating majors while also participating in presales. Retail investors who mirror this balance may be better positioned than those who focus exclusively on one side. Conclusion XRP’s consolidation after a 24-hour red period and Solana’s leading role in the correction show that markets are in reset mode. Analysts remain confident that these moves are precursors to a broader bull season rather than signals of decline. But for retail investors, the real excitement is often found outside the majors. MAGACOIN FINANCE , with its audits, scarcity-driven design, and viral community, has become one of the top names on retail watchlists. As XRP and Solana take time to recover, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides the speculative spark investors crave. The next bull season may be shaped not only by the performance of majors but also by how effectively retail captures momentum in projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE.

The token, once a major driver of retail enthusiasm, is now down more than 86% from its peak of $0.00008845. This year alone, SHIB has dropped nearly 44%, currently trading around $0.00001226 . While broader market assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum have managed steady gains, SHIB has remained stagnant near the $0.00001 level, fueling claims that the project has lost direction. Despite these criticisms, several factors could help the project recover and restore investor confidence. Addressing long-standing concerns while completing key ecosystem goals may be essential to putting SHIB back on track. These include the following; Improved Transparency and Leadership Structure One of the most frequent criticisms of Shiba Inu is the anonymity of its leadership . Although pseudonymous figures such as Shytoshi Kusama played a role in SHIB’s early growth, maintaining anonymous leadership at this stage creates barriers to accountability. In contrast, leading blockchain projects like Cardano, Ripple, and Dogecoin are managed by publicly identifiable teams. Moving toward a more transparent leadership structure could strengthen credibility and reassure investors. Strengthen Focus on the SHIB Ecosystem Concerns have also arisen regarding the team’s attention being divided between SHIB and other unrelated projects. Shytoshi Kusama’s promotion of the SHY token has drawn criticism for distracting investors from core SHIB ecosystem assets, including BONE, LEASH, and TREAT. Refocusing resources and messaging toward SHIB’s long-term utility would reinforce its relevance and could help realign the community’s attention. Improved Community Engagement The Shiba Inu community, known as the Shib Army , was once one of the most active forces in crypto. Their efforts contributed to SHIB’s listings on major platforms and its historic 2021 rally. However, enthusiasm has cooled in recent years. A renewed focus on direct engagement, clearer communication, and reward-driven participation could help reignite the community’s involvement and strengthen grassroots momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Addressing Oversupply Through Token Burns SHIB’s circulating supply of nearly 589 trillion tokens continues to limit price appreciation. While more than 41% of the total supply has already been burned, helped by community initiatives and Vitalik Buterin’s high-profile burn , progress remains slow. A structured, consistent, and large-scale token reduction plan could introduce meaningful scarcity and create better conditions for price recovery. Rebuild Security and Trust After Shibarium Incident The Shibarium Bridge hack raised significant concerns about the ecosystem’s security. Although steps have been taken, such as adopting multi-party custody solutions, cooperating with authorities, and offering bounties to attackers, the project must continue demonstrating commitment to robust security practices. Successfully restoring full functionality to the bridge would be a milestone in rebuilding trust among users and investors. Delivering on Pending Projects Shiba Inu has also faced criticism for delays in delivering major ecosystem products. Announcements around projects such as Shib: The Metaverse and the NFT marketplace have not translated into meaningful progress. Prioritizing the completion of these initiatives, rather than introducing new ones, would provide tangible value and demonstrate that the team can meet its commitments. Shiba Inu’s prolonged underperformance has prompted skepticism about its future, but dismissing it entirely may be premature. Greater transparency, stronger community engagement, meaningful supply reduction, improved security, and timely delivery of promised projects could help restore SHIB’s relevance in the cryptocurrency market. Without these changes, however, the project risks continuing its slide into obscurity. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

A new collaboration between Tobu Top Tours Co., Ltd. and SBI Ripple Asia Co., Ltd. aims to reshape digital transactions by combining blockchain technology with real-world commerce . The initiative could create new waves of opportunities for businesses, travelers, and communities. Ripple And XRP Strengthen Payments In Japan A recent press release by Tobu Top Tours reports that the Japanese travel MICE agency has partnered with SBI Ripple Asia to launch a new payment platform built on the XRP Ledger. The agreement, signed on September 30, marks a significant step toward integrating blockchain into mainstream industries , with tourism and commerce set to benefit the most. The initiative is designed to issue unique tokens by SBI Ripple Asia for partner companies and organizations. Tobu Top Tours will integrate these tokens into its ecosystem, linking them with Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that the company manages and plans to launch in 2026. The goal of the payments platform is to help businesses and organizations strengthen their fan economies, while also providing users with new ways to pay for services such as lodging, dining, and shopping. As part of the collaboration, Toby Top Tours will take the lead in securing partnerships , building a wide user and merchant network, and developing marketing strategies based on NFTs. Meanwhile, SBI Ripple Asia will handle the technical infrastructure by leveraging the XRP Ledger to issue secure, reliable tokens. With this blockchain foundation, customers can easily make payments using their tokens seamlessly in everyday situations. XRP Utility Expand Into Tourism And Fan Economies Beyond developing innovative payment systems, the Tobu Top Tours and SBI Ripple Asia alliance is aiming to have a broader societal and cultural impact. Several envisioned use cases for the new platform aim to address social challenges while simultaneously opening up new markets. In the tourism industry, companies plan to issue unique tokens restricted to specific regions or tourist hubs. This localized currency will enable travelers to enjoy seamless, cashless transactions across destinations, thereby stimulating spending and circulating money within the local economies. By pairing token usage with NFTs, such as digital souvenirs or future discount vouchers, the system is expected to foster lasting engagement even after the traveler has left. Another major application lies in disaster relief and reconstruction efforts . Instead of distributing traditional aid, funds could be provided as unique tokens that are redeemable only in the affected region. This ensures that financial assistance is spent locally, directly supporting shops, hotels, and restaurants. According to the press release, the upcoming payments platform could also have transformative potential for the entertainment industry , particularly in areas of culture, music, and sports . Professional teams, musicians, and cultural organizations can create tokens for exclusive use within their respective communities, thereby enhancing fan engagement.",XRP|MICE|nfts|Non Fungible Tokens|ripple|SBI Ripple Asia|Tobu Top Tours|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|XRP|WALLET|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-02 00:00:50
52539590,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=830338,1759363252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52539590.jpeg,"Bitcoin Displays Disturbing CME Gap, Here’s What Happens If The Gap Closes",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-disturbing-cme-gap/,"Bitcoin is now back trading above $115,000, but the recovery comes with a shadow that cannot be ignored. A new gap opened on the CME Bitcoin futures chart, and while the spot market has pushed higher since then, the presence of this gap opens up a bearish scenario. These gaps have a history of pulling Bitcoin back down to fill them, and the most recent one opens up questions about how long the current bullish momentum can last. Bitcoin Opens Up Huge CME Gap Crypto analyst Daan Crypto noted on the social media platform X how Bitcoin opened the week with a huge CME gap that has continued higher since the futures open. This gap is important, as it has been a while since Bitcoin opened with such a huge gap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forms Bearish Evening Star Pattern On Weekly Chart, But Can Price Go Below $100,000? As shown in the chart image below, this CME gap is between $110,000 and $111,300. Gaps on CME futures have a tendency to close fairly quickly, meaning that Bitcoin often retraces to the level of the gap before resuming its trend. If that happens this time, the short-term structure of Bitcoin’s price action could deteriorate into a bearish momentum. However, Daan also noted that this gap should not be considered in play unless Bitcoin drops below $111,000. But if that happens, the futures chart could drag spot prices lower and turn recent strength into weakness. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin? A CME gap occurs because the Chicago Mercantile Exchange does not trade over the weekend, unlike the spot Bitcoin market, which operates 24/7. When Bitcoin makes a big move on Saturday or Sunday, CME futures reopen on Sunday evening at a different level than they closed on Friday, and this leaves an empty gap on the price chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Is Over? These Signals Show Where The Market Is At It’s common knowledge that Bitcoin tends to fill these gaps by returning to the level of the gap before continuing in its trend. If Bitcoin retraces to close this latest gap between the $110,000 to $111,000 range, it would erase the recovery that pushed it to $115,000 and bring the price back into a zone of uncertainty. According to Daan Crypto, if that were to happen here, then the entire structure would look pretty bad in the short term. However, this might be one of those very few gaps that never closes or not until months later. This would most likely be the case, unless Bitcoin breaks below $111,000. A dip below $111,000 could ultimately see Bitcoin losing the $110,000 price level again. If Bitcoin can stay above $115,000 and there’s enough buying pressure, then the gap can be ignored in the short term. The next test will be whether buyers can sustain the recently found momentum and push towards $120,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $116,380, up by 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

This confluence of technical triple-top structure and ETF redemptions increases downside risk while traders watch volume and close below support for confirmation. Triple top chart pattern signals fading bullish momentum and increased breakdown risk. Institutional outflows — roughly $795.6M in one week — reflect waning confidence in spot ETH ETFs. Key supports at $3,900 and $3,850 must hold to avoid potential declines toward $3,600–$2,500 ranges. Ethereum ETF outflows surge; monitor $3,850 support and volume to gauge next move — read Coinotag analysis now. What is driving the recent Ethereum ETF outflows and ETH’s test of $3,850 support? Ethereum ETF outflows accelerated after recent volatility, with institutional investors withdrawing capital and reducing net ETF assets. Combined with a technical triple-top pattern, these outflows increase downside pressure as ETH hovers near the $3,850 support zone, making volume and daily closes critical for direction. How does the triple top pattern affect ETH price action? On the 3-day chart, ETH has formed a triple top where each peak failed to make a strong higher high. This pattern often precedes a decisive move lower when the neckline support is broken. Traders watch for a daily close below the neckline and rising volume as confirmation of a sustained decline. Source: AshCrypto via X (plain text) The triple top’s neckline has been tested multiple times since early 2024. Repeated tests weaken support and raise the probability of a sharp correction if sellers accelerate. Historical precedent suggests that a decisive breakdown can project moves significantly lower — traders should prepare for increased volatility. Why are institutional investors withdrawing from Ethereum Spot ETFs? Institutional outflows can reflect multiple factors: profit-taking, risk-off rotation, or reallocation across portfolios. Data cited by market trackers reports an approximate $795.56 million outflow for the week ending September 26, 2025, indicating meaningful repositioning among large holders. Source: Ted Pillows via X (plain text) Total ETF net assets have contracted to roughly $26.01 billion from intra-year highs above $30 billion, underscoring a shift in institutional sentiment. This capital rotation aligns with the technical weakness and indicates market participants are reducing exposure amid higher short-term risk. Frequently Asked Questions How likely is ETH to break below $3,850 and what are target levels? If ETH closes below $3,850 on higher volume, probability of a move toward $3,600 increases, with a deeper target range near $2,500 if selling momentum persists. Use volume and multi-day closes to confirm the breakout. What metrics should traders monitor during this period of ETF outflows? Watch trading volume, daily closes relative to $3,850 and $3,900 supports, ETF net flows, and open interest across derivatives. These indicators together provide a clearer picture of whether selling is broad-based or transient. Key Takeaways Technical risk : A triple top and repeated neckline tests raise the chance of a meaningful breakdown. Institutional flows : Roughly $795.6M in weekly ETF outflows indicates material repositioning by large investors. Actionable insight : Traders should wait for volume-confirmed closes below $3,850 before assuming a sustained downtrend; otherwise watch for bounces toward $4,060 resistance. Conclusion Ethereum faces a pivotal moment as ETF outflows collide with a bearish triple-top structure near the $3,850 support. Market participants should prioritize objective signals — volume, daily closes, and ETF flow data — before committing to directional trades.

Published: 2025-10-02 | Updated: 2025-10-02 | Author: COINOTAG What is Bullish’s expansion into 20 US states? Bullish’s expansion into 20 US states means the institutionally-focused exchange can now offer regulated spot trading and custody services across major markets after securing a BitLicense and a money transmission license from the New York regulator. The rollout targets hedge funds, market makers, fintechs and advanced traders. How did Bullish secure regulatory approval in New York? Bullish obtained a BitLicense and money transmission license from the New York State Department of Financial Services, a process viewed as stringent and regulatory-intensive. A BitLicense authorizes virtual currency transmission, custody and issuance in New York and is widely recognized as one of the strictest state-level crypto authorizations. Bullish opened trading to two institutional clients on day one: crypto infrastructure provider BitGo and brokerage Nonco, the company said. The platform combines a central limit order book with a deterministic automated market maker to deliver deep liquidity and efficient execution, according to Bullish president Chris Tyrer.

Approved US states include California, Florida, Arizona, Washington, DC and New York, plus Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wyoming and Puerto Rico. What fees and account types does Bullish offer in the US? Bullish is offering 0% maker fees for institutional accounts and 0% trading fees for advanced individual accounts in the 20 approved states. The fee structure is positioned to attract institutional flow and sophisticated retail traders seeking lower execution costs. How large is Bullish’s historic trading footprint? Bullish reports it has processed roughly $1.5 trillion in trading volume internationally since launching in late 2021. It states it ranks among the top ten exchanges by Bitcoin and Ether trading volume globally, despite only now entering broad U.S. markets. “Bullish was created for institutions, and now we’re proud to offer the same level of performance to serious traders across the US,” Bullish said in a statement attributed to company leadership. What was the market reaction to the US launch? Bullish (BLSH) shares declined 4.4% to $60.80 on Wednesday, according to plain text market data from Google Finance. The stock remains more than 60% above its $37 IPO price from mid-August, with an approximate market capitalization of $9 billion on the same data. BLSH’s change in share price on Wednesday. Source: Google Finance Why institutional players are being targeted? Bullish’s product design—central limit order book plus deterministic AMM—aims to deliver predictable liquidity and tight spreads for large orders. The U.S. regulatory approval opens opportunities to onboard hedge funds, prop trading firms, market makers, fintechs and neobanks that require licensed custody and trading services. Frequently Asked Questions Is Bullish fully regulated to operate in the US? Yes. Bullish received a New York BitLicense and a money transmission license which enable it to offer regulated virtual currency transmission and custody services in New York and support expansion into other states where it is licensed. How can institutional clients access Bullish? Institutions can apply for institutional accounts through Bullish’s onboarding process; the platform has already enabled access for BitGo and Nonco as initial institutional users in the US rollout. Will retail traders in non-approved states be able to use Bullish? Not immediately. Trading access is limited to the 20 approved US states and Puerto Rico; Bullish intends to expand coverage as it secures additional state-level authorizations. Key Takeaways Regulatory milestone : Bullish received a NY BitLicense and money transmission license, enabling US operations. Product offering : 0% maker fees for institutions and 0% trading fees for advanced U.S. individuals in approved states. Market scale : Bullish reports $1.5 trillion handled since 2021 and remains a top-ten exchange by BTC/ETH volume. Conclusion Bullish’s US launch represents a major regulatory and commercial step, making its institutional-grade trading and low-fee structure available across 20 states. Market participants should evaluate custody, fees and liquidity before onboarding; expect further state approvals and product rollouts in the coming months. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bullish Launches Trading in 20 US States After NY BitLicense Approval"", ""description"": ""Bullish’s regulated crypto trading is now available in 20 US states after the New York State Department of Financial Services granted a BitLicense and a money transmission license."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199a231-63ee-75d3-ba5a-af690204e173.webp"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T00:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T00:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199a231-63ee-75d3-ba5a-af690204e173.webp"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bullish-launch-20-us-states-2025-10-02""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is Bullish fully regulated to operate in the US?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Bullish obtained a New York BitLicense and money transmission license, enabling regulated crypto transmission and custody services as part of its US expansion."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Which states can access Bullish now?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Bullish is available in 20 US states including California, Florida, Arizona, Washington, DC, New York, and the US territory of Puerto Rico."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What fees does Bullish charge institutions?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Bullish offers 0% maker fees for institutional accounts and 0% trading fees for advanced individual accounts in the approved states."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to start trading on Bullish in approved US states"", ""description"": ""Steps for institutions and advanced traders to access Bullish after its 20-state launch."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199a231-63ee-75d3-ba5a-af690204e173.webp"", ""totalTime"": ""PT1H"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Confirm eligibility"", ""text"": ""Verify that your organization or personal residence is within one of the 20 approved US states or Puerto Rico and prepare required KYC documentation."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Onboard and verify account"", ""text"": ""Complete institutional or advanced individual account registration and submit regulatory and compliance documents for review."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Fund and trade"", ""text"": ""Transfer assets into Bullish custody, confirm fee schedule and start trading with access to institutional liquidity and 0% maker fees where applicable."" } ]}",Bitcoin|News|BTC|FLOW|MKR,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-02 00:15:17

By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $776.48. In 2031, AAVE will range between $1,164.73 to $1,261.79. Aave is a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2025? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $286.93 Market cap $4.38B Trading volume (24-h) $432.83M Circulating supply 15.25M AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $287.88 24-hour high $270.42 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 5.84% 50-day SMA $303.74 14-Day RSI 41.50 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $256.85 Aave 1-day price analysis Key takeaways AAVE is pressing against $287 resistance on both the daily and 4-hour charts. The daily MACD has turned positive, signaling potential for bullish continuation. Aave 1-day price chart On the daily timeframe for October 2, AAVE is trading at $286.98, pressing against the mid-Bollinger band resistance at $287.25. This is a critical level, and closing above it could push AAVE toward the upper band near $318.54. The lower band support at $255.95 provides a safety net, meaning a break below that would flip sentiment bearish again. The MACD has just crossed into positive territory, reflecting strengthening momentum, while recent volume around 30M supports the current breakout attempt. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView If the bulls complete a takeover, AAVE could test $318–$320, though profit-taking pressures may appear there. However, if momentum fades, downside supports at $272 and $256 should be watched closely. Aave 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour timeframe, AAVE surged sharply from $276 to $287, now consolidating just under the resistance level. The Alligator indicator shows widening EMAs, confirming trend strength, while the RSI sits at 66, approaching overbought territory. This suggests buyers remain in control, though momentum is slowing slightly at the consolidation point around $288. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView If AAVE holds above $281 support (the Alligator green baseline), continuation toward $292–$295 looks likely. However, failure to sustain above $286 could trigger a pullback into the $278–$280 range, where the next buy-in opportunity would emerge. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $290.98 SELL SMA 5 $281.04 BUY SMA 10 $283.23 BUY SMA 21 $290.97 SELL SMA 50 $303.74 SELL SMA 100 $294.50 SELL SMA 200 $256.85 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $290.91 SELL EMA 5 $298.53 SELL EMA 10 $306.92 SELL EMA 21 $308.54 SELL EMA 50 $300.32 SELL EMA 100 $283.43 BUY EMA 200 $259.17 BUY AAVE price analysis conclusion AAVE exhibits renewed bullish momentum in the meantime, with momentum indicators turning positive. However, the current price movement suggests the $287–$290 zone remains a decisive barrier. A breakout above this range could drive prices toward $305. If the bears regain control of the market, a retracement toward $278–$280 is expected before another rally attempt. Is AAVE a good investment?

XRP’s trading volume remains strong at nearly $4.9 billion, indicating steady market participation despite a slight cooling in derivative metrics. What does David Schwartz’s departure mean for Ripple and XRP? David Schwartz’s move to CTO Emeritus and a board seat signals a managed leadership transition while preserving technical continuity. Ripple retains Schwartz’s institutional knowledge, and the XRPL developer community expects continued engagement through his node operation and advisory role. How did the market react to the announcement? XRP opened at $2.85 and recorded a modest 1.5% decline the day following the announcement. Trading stayed inside a seven-day band of $2.71–$2.98, with weekly and monthly gains of 1.2% and 4% respectively. The 24-hour trading volume remained robust at about $4.9 billion, suggesting persistent liquidity and investor interest. How are on-chain and technical indicators interpreting the news? On-chain signals and technical indicators point to consolidation. The RSI sits near 45, indicating neutral momentum. Bollinger Bands show reduced volatility, often a precursor to larger price movement. Short-term moving averages hint at mild selling pressure; longer-term 100- and 200-day averages reflect structural strength that could support a move above $2.98 if bullish momentum returns. Why will the transition be gradual and what will Schwartz do next? Schwartz described a phased reduction in day-to-day duties, maintaining technical involvement by running his XRPL node and advising developers. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse emphasized continuity, crediting Schwartz with shaping company culture and long-term technical strategy. The new board role should preserve strategic input without daily operational responsibility. Frequently Asked Questions When will David Schwartz officially step down from daily operations?

Yes. He plans to keep his XRPL node active and remain engaged with developers and the XRP community in an advisory capacity. Is XRP price likely to fall further after the announcement? Current indicators are neutral; short-term pressure was modest (1.5% dip), but strong volume and longer-term moving averages suggest a stable outlook rather than a pronounced decline. Key Takeaways Controlled leadership change : Schwartz moves to CTO Emeritus and a board seat, preserving technical continuity. Price stability : XRP at $2.85, within a seven-day range, backed by strong 24h volume near $4.9B. Watch technical indicators : Neutral RSI and tight Bollinger Bands point to consolidation and possible breakout potential. Conclusion Ripple CTO David Schwartz’s planned transition in December 2025 appears orderly and unlikely to disrupt core development or investor confidence. XRP’s resilient pricing, robust volume, and mixed technical signals suggest the market is absorbing the news while remaining primed for future directional moves.

The initiative will introduce zero-knowledge proof technology and decentralized identity verification across SK Planet’s ecosystem, which serves 28 million users and 95,000 merchant partners. Enterprise-scale decentralized identity Moca Network, a project by Animoca Brands, is building a chain-agnostic identity layer designed to give users ownership of their data while ensuring interoperability across platforms. By integrating AIR Account and AIR Identity, SK Planet aims to allow merchants to verify user information with explicit consent, while ensuring that private data remains under user control. “Partnering with Moca Network enables SK Planet to bring decentralized identity and privacy-preserving verification to our millions of customers and merchant partners,” said Kyosu Kim, chief business officer at SK Planet. “By leveraging AIR Kit and AIR Wallet, we can expand the benefits of OKI Club and reward our users with MOCA Coin while giving them greater control over their data. This is a strategic step forward in aligning with global standards for user privacy and digital identity.” Kenneth Shek, project lead of Moca Network, added: “SK Planet’s purchase of MOCA Coin as well as its integration of AIR Kit infrastructure and adoption of zero-knowledge proofs mark an important milestone in returning data ownership to users at an enterprise scale.” The partnership builds on the February 2025 launch of SK Planet’s OKI Club, which integrated AIR Wallet to let users earn and manage rewards. The company now plans to extend these capabilities with AIR Identity, enabling users to verify credentials and access rewards across multiple platforms, with features including token swaps and staking .

This adjustment has reduced both the number of tokens and the dollar value required to rank among the wealthiest XRP addresses. XRP has experienced notable selling pressure in recent weeks. After reaching a local high of $3.18 on September 13, the asset has since dropped by more than 10%. The decline intensified on September 21, when XRP lost support above the $3 level. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading around $2.84. While the price downturn has been disappointing for many investors, it has also created a less expensive pathway for those aiming to secure a spot on the XRP Rich List . The reduced cost has made it easier to join the top 10%, 5%, and even the top 1% of holders. Top 10% Requirement Falls Below $7,000 To be ranked among the top 10% of XRP addresses, investors now need to hold 2,362 tokens, which equates to approximately $6,708 at current market prices. This marks the first time in several months that the capital needed to reach this threshold has slipped under $7,000. For comparison, in early August, the requirement stood at 2,433 XRP worth $7,299. By the end of that month, the figure dropped slightly to $7,188, followed by a further decline to $7,131 in mid-September. The current $6,708 requirement represents a decrease of nearly $600 in less than two months. Shifts in Other Categories The entry costs for higher-ranked categories on the XRP Rich List have also decreased. For the top 5%, the requirement has fallen from 8,301 XRP ($24,903 as of September 12) to 8,229 XRP, now valued at about $23,370. This change reduces the financial commitment by more than $1,500. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The most exclusive category, the top 1%, has similarly seen a decline. As of September 12, an investor needed 50,025 XRP worth $150,075. Today, the threshold stands at 50,004 XRP, with a market value of $142,011, a $8,000 reduction. Growth in Address Participation Despite the lower thresholds, the number of addresses within these groups has been steadily increasing. Data shows there are currently 705,004 addresses in the top 10%, compared with roughly 352,500 in the top 5%. The top 1% now comprises around 70,500 addresses. Some analysts suggest that the present conditions could offer investors a rare opportunity to strengthen their holdings before potential market shifts. Market commentator Coach JV recently argued that XRP’s next major upward move could occur rapidly and without warning, urging investors to prepare while entry costs remain low. Overall, while XRP’s price struggles have raised concerns among existing holders, the lower thresholds for the XRP Rich List have opened the door for new participants seeking entry into the asset’s upper holding tiers.

Trader Altcoin Gordon cautioned that XRP’s upcoming move might unfold quickly and with force, telling traders to be ready before it takes off. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buyers Step Back After Failed Push Beyond $115,000: Data Price has been stuck below $3 for weeks, and September produced no clear upward momentum, leaving traders on edge as regulators and markets add to uncertainty. Trader Warning Spurs Urgency Short-term charts show XRP compressing after a slide that began in July when the token crossed $3.60. Based on reports, Gordon’s shared chart points to prices tightening toward a breakout point. Compression like this stores volatility. It does not promise an uptrend, but when a move comes it can be abrupt. Some traders see that as an opportunity; others see a risk of chasing a quick spike. Mark my words, the next leg up for $XRP will be fast and aggressive. You’re either positioned BEFORE it happens, or begin for an entry once it does. Connect the dots or stay broke. pic.twitter.com/QCCFxyJe4P — Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) September 29, 2025 Compression And Historical Runs Reports have disclosed that research groups, including Sistine Research, say this is the third major compression since the last US election cycle. Past compressions have been followed by big moves. In late 2024, XRP rose from $0.50 to above $3.40 within weeks — a rapid jump that surprised many. Analysts now point to a range of possible outcomes, with targets that span from $8 to as much as $33 on extreme scenarios based on extensions and past cycle math. Those top-end figures are outliers and should be treated with caution. On-Chain Flows On-chain data from Santiment shows large wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million XRP added over $300 million in three days. Those wallets now hold close to 8 billion XRP, levels last seen in August before earlier rallies. Such accumulation can be bullish, though it can also set up fast squeezes that benefit early sellers. Momentum, ETFs And Market Sentiment Meanwhile, market chatter has been shaped by hopes around potential XRP-based ETFs, with a key US decision expected in October. If approvals arrive, funds could flow in quickly. If regulators delay or deny listings, sentiment could reverse. At the same time, broader crypto strength in Bitcoin and Ethereum has helped lift appetite for large-cap altcoins, and derivatives data shows rising futures volume and open interest around XRP.

52541548,594556,1759366830,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52541548.jpeg,South Korea’s Crypto Scene Shrinks As Traders Flock Offshore: Report,https://bitcoinist.com/south-koreas-crypto-scene-shrinks-as-traders-flock-offshore-report/,"South Korean crypto trading is shifting overseas as domestic exchanges see big drops in fiat deposits and trading activity, according to reports. While user numbers have risen, the money parked in won and the size of local markets have shrunk, signaling that more capital is finding its way to foreign platforms. Capital Flight Accelerating According to Fnnews , KRW deposits held on local exchanges fell by 42% to about ₩6.2 trillion compared with the end of last year. Daily average trading volume also slipped to ₩6.4 trillion, down 12% from the prior half-year. Domestic crypto market capitalization was reported at roughly ₩95.1 trillion, a decline of 14% over the same period, while the global market cap fell by about 7%. At the same time, outflows of crypto reached ₩101.6 trillion overall, with ₩78.9 trillion routed to registered foreign operators — that channel rose by 4%. These figures point to large sums moving beyond Korea’s trading venues. Kimchi Coins Face Listing Pressure Reports have disclosed that exchanges are tightening which tokens they list. The number of unique crypto assets listed domestically is 653, up by 55, but many of those assets trade only on a single platform. There are 279 single-listing assets and about 43% of them have market caps of ₩100 million or less. That level of concentration leaves small tokens exposed to sharp price swings and to delisting risk if liquidity dries up or regulators press for stronger disclosure. User Growth But Smaller Trades User accounts are up to about 10.77 million, an increase of 11% from the prior year-end. Yet average capital per user appears lower, given the fall in KRW deposits and daily volume. Average losses from peak prices have also deepened; the mean maximum drawdown rose to about 72% from 68% previously. In short: more people hold accounts, but less money is staying on local platforms and risk for small holders has increased. Regulatory And Banking Frictions Come Into Play Based on reports, stricter rules and tougher bank partnerships are part of the story. Some exchanges struggle to keep real-name bank accounts or to meet new oversight criteria. When fiat rails are weak, users turn to overseas venues that offer broader token lists and larger pools of liquidity. That has created an incentive for both traders and projects to look beyond the domestic market.

These bitcoin (BTC) options will be margined and settled in the regulated, dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC, which boasts a market cap of $73.85 billion at press time, the second-largest in the stablecoin industry. Additionally, they will be European-style options with expiries ranging from three weeks to three months. The contract multiplier will be 1, meaning one contract represents one full BTC. The exchange plans to list options tied to ether, as well as other single assets and multi-asset indices, such as the CoinDesk 20 and CoinDesk 5, in the future. Bullish's decision to launch options is part of a broader industry trend marked by increasing demand for hedging instruments across the full spectrum of crypto products. This growing appetite is exemplified by the rising popularity of options tied to BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF, which now rivals Deribit's BTC options. ""Bullish is investing significantly in its institutional offering,” said Chris Tyrer, President of Bullish Exchange. “Our journey began with spot trading, expanded to include margin, then perpetual and dated futures, and now reaches a new milestone with the introduction of options."" He added that the new product aims to deliver a complete derivatives product suite with capital efficiency and risk mitigation, all accessible through a single, unified trading account. Options are derivative contracts that grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific asset, such as bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, at a predetermined price within a set time frame. A call option gives the right to buy, representing a bullish bet on the market, while a put protects against potential price losses. The special thing about options is that they facilitate three-dimensional trading, allowing traders to bet on the price direction, the degree of price volatility and leverage time to expiration. This multi-faceted nature enables traders to create synthetic positions by combining spot, futures, and options markets, allowing them to manage risk with more tailored and flexible strategies. Consortium of day-one trading partners Bullish's new options have been designed in close collaboration with leading options market makers, technology providers, and brokers to ensure they are specifically tailored to meet the needs of institutional investors. More importantly, from day one, these options will be supported by a range of confirmed industry heavyweights as trading partners, including Abraxas Capital Management, Ampersan, B2C2, BlockTech, Cumberland, FalconX, Fig Markets, Flow Traders, Galaxy Digital, Monarq Asset Management, Pulsar, SignalPlus, Wintermute, and Qube Research & Technologies. “Galaxy is excited to support the next chapter of Bullish’s journey,” said Jason Urban, Global Head of Trading at Galaxy. “The addition of options to its product suite is a strong step forward – enhancing liquidity, deepening price discovery, and strengthening the overall maturity of the crypto derivatives market.” Unified margin system The global crypto options market is valued at over $50 billion in notional open interest, with Deribit alone accounting for more than 80% of the activity. In other words, the exchange has a massive head start compared to the impending Bullish options contracts. Still, Bullish's announcement stands out due to the platform's unified margin system, according to Tyrer. ""Bullish clients access all products via our unified account structure, allowing them to trade spot, perps, dated futures and now options with risk offsets and portfolio collateralization. This setup is designed for maximum capital efficiency, which is of paramount importance to our institutional client base,"" Chris Tyrer, President of Bullish Exchange, said. On Deribit, Segregated Standard Margin is the default margin system , which means that standard margin, the initial margin and maintenance margin (MM) requirements are calculated separately for each position in the account. These requirements are then summed together to generate the total margin requirements for the account. Lastly, Bullish already has vibrant futures and spot markets, which are often seen as a prerequisite for a successful options product. Since its launch in November 2021, Bullish has surpassed $1.5 trillion in cumulative trading volume. This year, the platform has executed over $2 billion in average daily volume and ranks in the top ten exchanges by spot volume for bitcoin and ether.

Instant in‑kind minting and redemption for tokenized US stocks. Single API call to tokenize portfolios and redeem tokens without cash settlement delays. The tokenized stock market exceeds $700 million; broader tokenization represents over $31 billion onchain. Instant Tokenization Network: Alpaca’s ITN enables institutions to mint and redeem tokenized US stocks in‑kind, 24/7. Explore why this matters for onchain liquidity. What is the Instant Tokenization Network? The Instant Tokenization Network (ITN) is Alpaca’s platform that enables US‑regulated financial institutions to convert portfolios into tokenized US stocks and redeem tokens back into the underlying shares in‑kind . The service offers a single API workflow and 24/7 operational access to speed settlement and improve liquidity. How does Alpaca’s ITN enable in‑kind redemptions? Alpaca’s ITN journals securities between brokerage accounts and delivers tokens to an issuer’s Authorized Participant. Institutions can exchange tokens directly for the underlying shares without first converting to cash. This removes typical settlement windows and aligns tokenized stock mechanics with in‑kind ETF creation/redemption models. The Instant Tokenization Network allows institutions to mint and redeem tokenized US stocks with in‑kind settlement and 24/7 access. US broker‑dealer Alpaca has launched the Instant Tokenization Network (ITN) to let institutions mint and redeem tokenized US stocks directly. The platform targets structural frictions that have limited liquidity in the tokenized equities segment. The ITN provides a single API call to tokenize portfolios and supports in‑kind redemptions, enabling institutions to receive the underlying shares when redeeming tokens. The network operates outside traditional market hours, offering continuous access to token issuance and redemption. The tokenized stock market is currently valued at more than $700 million. Source: RWA.xyz By enabling in‑kind settlement — swapping tokens for the actual securities rather than cash — Alpaca aims to reduce settlement overhead and enhance market efficiency. The approach mirrors in‑kind practices recently approved by regulators for some cryptocurrency exchange‑traded products. Alpaca said the ITN is available to US‑regulated financial institutions and is designed to integrate with custodial and broker‑dealer workflows. Arush Sehgal, Alpaca’s head of crypto, described the ITN as a two‑step API process focusing on journaling securities and delivering tokens to an Authorized Participant. “ITN’s process is best understood as a single API that enables two functions,” Arush Sehgal, Alpaca’s head of crypto, said in a company statement. “First, the journaling of securities to and from brokerage accounts for US‑regulated institutions. Second, delivery of tokens by the issuer to their Authorized Participant.” Alpaca has provided infrastructure for prior tokenization initiatives, including platforms that tokenize stocks and ETFs. The company’s new network extends that work to support fully in‑kind token life cycles. Rob Hadick speaking on the sidelines of TOKEN2049. Source: Andrew Fenton/Cointelegraph Why does in‑kind redemption matter for tokenized stocks? In‑kind redemption reduces counterparty and liquidity risk by ensuring token holders can obtain the underlying shares directly. This mechanism shortens settlement chains and can increase tradability of tokenized equities onchain. Regulators and industry participants have highlighted in‑kind processes as key to scaling tokenized financial products. How big is the tokenization opportunity? Tokenization of real‑world assets has become a major trend in 2025, with industry data showing more than $31 billion represented onchain. The tokenized stock market alone is estimated at over $700 million . These figures signal growing institutional interest but also underscore the need for operational innovations like ITN to deepen liquidity. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/instant-tokenization-network-alpaca-itn"" }, ""headline"": ""Alpaca launches Instant Tokenization Network for in‑kind tokenized US stocks"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/uploads/2025-10/0199a04b-3fc4-7b51-a088-9a801264e738"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T10:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Alpaca's Instant Tokenization Network enables US‑regulated institutions to mint and redeem tokenized US stocks in‑kind, offering a single API and 24/7 access to boost onchain liquidity.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to tokenize a stock portfolio using Alpaca's Instant Tokenization Network"", ""description"": ""Step‑by‑step process for institutional tokenization and in‑kind redemption using ITN."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Prepare securities for journaling"", ""text"": ""Identify eligible US equities and ensure they are held in US‑regulated brokerage accounts for journaling."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Call the ITN mint API"", ""text"": ""Use the single API call to mint tokenized representations of the portfolio to the issuer."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Deliver tokens to Authorized Participant"", ""text"": ""The issuer delivers tokens to the Authorized Participant, who can trade or redeem them onchain."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Execute in‑kind redemption"", ""text"": ""Authorized Participants redeem tokens for the underlying shares, completing settlement without cash conversion."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Who can use Alpaca's Instant Tokenization Network?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The ITN is available to US‑regulated financial institutions such as broker‑dealers and custodians that meet eligibility and compliance requirements."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Does ITN settle token redemptions in cash or shares?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""ITN supports in‑kind redemptions, allowing tokens to be exchanged directly for the underlying shares rather than settling in cash."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will in‑kind settlement improve liquidity?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""In‑kind settlement can shorten settlement chains and reduce frictions, which should improve onchain liquidity for tokenized equities over time."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions Is ITN restricted to US stocks only? Alpaca’s ITN is designed for tokenization of US‑listed equities and currently available to US‑regulated institutions. Expansion to other asset types would depend on regulatory and operational factors. How quickly can tokens be minted and redeemed? The ITN uses a single API to initiate minting or redemption and offers 24/7 access. In‑kind redemption bypasses standard cash settlement windows, speeding the overall process. Key Takeaways Operational efficiency : ITN provides a single API for minting and in‑kind redemption to reduce settlement friction. Liquidity impact : In‑kind processes aim to improve tradability of tokenized stocks and align with recent regulatory precedents. Institutional focus : The network is offered to US‑regulated institutions, emphasizing custody, compliance and control over execution environments. Conclusion The Instant Tokenization Network represents a practical step toward scalable tokenized equities by combining in‑kind settlement, a streamlined API, and 24/7 operations. As tokenization grows beyond $31 billion onchain, ITN’s model could help bridge TradFi requirements and onchain liquidity — a development institutions will watch closely.",News|BTC,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-02 01:05:04

Users will receive notifications of the change from next week. The development highlights the company’s effort to more closely link its significant investments in generative AI to its core online advertising business. Meta ramped up AI hiring and spending over the summer, projecting in its July Q2 earnings report that these initiatives will push higher expense growth in 2026 compared with 2025. The tech giant currently provides generative AI capabilities to users via its digital assistant, which is built across its apps, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Meta AI is also available as a stand-alone app and website. Users can utilize Meta AI the same way they do with OpenAI’s ChatGPT, asking it to provide directions or generate images based on prompts. The Mark Zuckerberg -helmed company also stated that the digital assistant now has more than 1 billion active monthly users. However, this figure does not specifically refer to the digital assistant standalone app. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg said that the digital assistant reached 1 billion monthly active users , and added that eventually “there will be opportunities to either insert paid recommendations” or offer “a subscription service so that people can pay to use more compute.” In the early days of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg and his team famously embraced the motto, “Move fast and break things.” Posters bearing the phrase reportedly lined the walls of the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters, alongside other similarly bold mantras like “Done is better than perfect” and “Fail quicker.” The message was clear for the young company: being first mattered more than getting it right the first time. Voice and text inputs from Ray-Ban Meta glasses feed into the recommendation engine Meta’s privacy and data policy manager, Christy Harris, noted during a media briefing that people already assumed the Facebook parent was incorporating generative AI interactions with ad targeting and content recommendations. “While this is a natural progression of our personalization efforts and will help give us even better recommendations for people, we want to be super transparent about it and provide a heads up before we actually begin using this data in a new way, even if people already thought that we were doing this,” Harris said. Harris illustrated how the update might affect the content and ads shown on Facebook, Instagram, and other Meta platforms. When users discuss family vacation plans with the digital assistant, the assistant’s responses could shape the Reels short videos they are recommended on Facebook. “So the Reels that I see on my Facebook feed or other types of content that are recommended to me could include family-friendly travel destinations,” Harris said. “It could include ads for hotels or other signals that would be informed by the conversation that I have had with Meta AI.” People’s voice interactions with the digital assistant through the company’s Ray-Ban Meta glasses will also influence Meta’s recommendation engine, Harris explained. She said that whether you’re typing your interactions or using the audio version, those signals will still be incorporated. Update goes live December 16, with no opt-put for active users However, the update will not factor in user interactions with Meta AI on WhatsApp unless users link their accounts on the messaging app with other Meta platforms, such as Instagram, Harris added. Users will not have the option to opt out of the recommendation engine changes, but Harris noted that “if they don’t interact with Meta AI, the update won’t apply to them.” The tech giant plans to roll out the recommendation update in the UK and EU “following our usual regulatory updates,” Harris said.

This integrates features that will boost its AI performance. These changes could significantly increase Arm’s revenues and enable Qualcomm’s chips to compete more effectively with its rivals, such as MediaTek and Apple. The semiconductor manufacturer’s decision has clarified earlier controversies raised by individuals regarding whether it will continue to work with Arm technology after a tough legal dispute between the two in 2024. Qualcomm participates in the growing trend of utilizing Arm’s v9 technology Following Qualcomm’s announcement , Arm’s shares substantially surged by 5% during regular trading hours. This left several analysts anticipating that the semiconductor manufacturer will increase Arm’s earnings. Notably, this company charges higher prices for its latest technology. In the meantime, the chipmaker, based in San Diego, California, introduced a new generation of chips for PCs and mobile phones last week. According to information from two sources with knowledge of the situation who wished to remain anonymous, as the talks were confidential, these chips will use Arm’s computing architecture, the ninth version called “v9.” This version includes several enhancements to improve how chips handle tasks such as chatbots and image generation. The main drive behind Qualcomm’s decision is to solidify its position as a leader in the tech ecosystem. The company initiated this focus after realizing that its rival, MediaTek, which sometimes outperforms it, utilizes Arm’s v9 technology. Additionally, most analysts speculated that Apple applied this architecture in its operations. Concerning its widespread adoption in the tech industry, experts have concluded that this technology, referred to as an instruction set architecture, is essential for determining what kinds of programs can run on a central processing unit. Qualcomm did not disclose details regarding Arm’s technology used in its latest chips, but highlighted that it chose the instructions that could benefit its customers. The company also pointed out that the advantage of having its own CPU design team is that it can select the instructions that offer value. Jay Goldberg refers to Qualcomm’s decision as a big development Arm is competing against newer firms like RISC-V, which offers a free open chip standard. However, this technology is much younger than Arm’s, and fewer software developers are utilizing it. Regarding Qualcomm’s decision, the company also had the option to stick with an earlier version of Arm’s technology, as it did for chips released last year. Still, it is hard to say by how much Qualcomm’s decision could grow Arm’s revenue. This is because Qualcomm licenses the computing architecture of Arm but largely designs its chips independently, rather than simply purchasing parts from Arm, according to Jay Goldberg, a senior research analyst for semiconductors and electronics at Seaport Research Partners. Goldberg also mentioned that this was a significant development, as the legal fight was still ongoing. He made these remarks regarding a less than a year ago conflict whereby Arm had threatened to revoke an important license held by Qualcomm, only to pull back from that threat. “This is great news for Arm,” Goldberg said of Qualcomm’s reported efforts, pointing out that “these were companies at war, not friends.

While macro optimism reigns supreme everywhere, there’s a DeFi project that flies under the radar, stepping into the limelight. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , now preselling for $0.035, is drawing whale and retail interest both because of its twofold lending model, as well as its planned stablecoin launch. Though Bitcoin remains the institutional standard, smart money is placing bets early for potential exponential returns, and MUTM’s ruthless presale velocity with over 16,670 holders and $16.6 million raised in capital shows it has the potential to become one of the largest breakout champions of the upcoming cycle. Bitcoin’s Road to $200K Could Rely on the Fed’s Next Giant Move The next big bitcoin rally will be less driven by sentiment and more by macroeconomics, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz feels. In a recent interview, Novogratz explained how one likely change of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to a dovish individual could be the strongest catalyst for the crypto space, and it could push the price of bitcoin all the way to as much as $200,000. The follow-on September 25 basis point Fed cut, year’s first, also elicited a muted price reaction, lowering BTC to around $109,570. But analysts forecast continued monetary accommodation and Fed leadership shake-up to trigger a wholesale reversal of liquidity flows to prepare the ground for Bitcoin’s next parabolic lift. While institutional investors prepare for that contingency, they are also searching for high-leverage wagers that might better the performance of BTC in relative terms and Mutuum Finance is already starting to see that attention. Mutuum Finance Presale Numbers Show High Investor Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a new record set in its Stage 6 presale, and tokens are now worth $0.035, up 16.17% from the previous round. Investor demand remains high, and over 16,670 users and over $16.6 million have been invested up to now, reflecting increasingly strengthened faith in the long-term vision and prospects of the project. Mutuum Finance is offering a $100,000 giveaway to encourage early adopters. Ten lucky participants will receive individual $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, and this project’s vision is thus focused on generating long-term value and aiding in growth in terms of community building. Enhanced Security and Risk Management Mutuum Finance puts maximum focus on security. The platform established a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program to incentivize developers and security researchers to stress test and report bugs. Bugs are graded on a four-step severity level: critical, major, minor, and low, providing full confidence against potential hazards. Mutuum Finance is a risk-weighted Loan-to-Value (LTV) protocol that assigns adequate collateral to every asset according to its riskiness, thereby a more stable and balanced lending process. During periods of market volatility, the protocol features a buffer reserve mechanism, with additional reserves on riskier assets as extra collateral. Real-time dynamic LTV and liquidation ratios are dynamically tuned to meet contemporary market realities so that the protocol is able to respond effectively to volatility. Reserve multipliers are stepped from 10% on lower-risk assets to 35% for higher-risk classes, adding an extra layer of systemic insurance. Efficiency is also of prime importance to Mutuum Finance. Collateral is maximized to create the highest borrowing capacity and correlated assets are utilized to optimize lending and borrowing efficiency. Such frameworks provide low risks of insolvency as well as a stable, sustainable DeFi system. The Next Big Altcoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making it happen with over $16.6M raised, 16,670+ investors, and 50% Phase 6 presale sold for $0.035. The platform offers dual lending, USD-stablecoin collateralized with USD, and strong risk management, i.e., a $50K Bug Bounty. Early birds can also participate in a $100K giveaway.

52543635,594522,1759370441,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52543635.jpeg,Saylor Unveils His Bitcoin Endgame That Could Upend Global Finance,https://bitcoinist.com/saylor-bitcoin-endgame-upend-global-finance/,"In a wide-ranging September interview with Bitcoin Magazine, MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor condensed five years of corporate experimentation into a stark, almost mechanical blueprint for what he calls Bitcoin’s “endgame”: accumulate an unprecedented stockpile of the asset as digital capital, then manufacture a new tier of credit markets on top of it. “The endgame is we accumulate a trillion dollars worth of BTC and then we grow that capital by issuing more credit,” Saylor said . He cast the maneuver not as a speculative side bet but as the next logical phase of corporate finance, with Bitcoin reconstituted as “digital energy” and balance sheets reimagined as engines that spin yield from over-collateralized, Bitcoin-backed instruments. Saylor’s Bitcoin Endgame Plan Saylor’s framing is deliberately elemental. He stitched BTC into a centuries-long lineage of civilization-scale energy breakthroughs—from fire and steel to petroleum and electricity—arguing that the asset’s monetary properties are best understood as a way to move economic “energy” across time and space at light speed. “Bitcoin is hope because Bitcoin represents digital energy,” he said. “A way to convey energy through time, through space… the next paradigm shift.” To Saylor, the institutional misunderstanding of that shift is not a bug but the core of the opportunity. “I would say 95% of the decision makers in the finance world still don’t really embrace or understand the idea of digital energy,” he argued, adding that society’s digestion lag is typical of paradigm shifts: “Bitcoin is evolving faster than society can digest it.” At the heart of the playbook is a simple balance-sheet identity, scaled. Treat Bitcoin as the monetary base—“ digital gold ”—then securitize it as “digital credit” in forms familiar to capital markets: converts, preferreds, money-market-like paper, longer-duration bonds. “If I create a company that buys Bitcoin and I accumulate a billion dollars of Bitcoin, I have a billion dollars of digital capital. What can I do with it? I can issue digital credit,” he said. In Saylor’s model, the equity of a firm that repeatedly performs this cycle becomes “digital equity,” engineered to outperform the underlying asset through conservative leverage and tenor management: “If I want to create a company that’s going to perform 2x Bitcoin, I take the Bitcoin, I issue Bitcoin-backed credit… I create digital equity and the digital equity outperforms the underlying capital asset.” He insists the competitive set is not other Bitcoin treasuries but the vast inventory of 20th-century credit—mortgage, corporate, and sovereign—priced off low or repressed yields and often secured by depreciating or illiquid collateral. “What they’re competing against is the existing credit instruments in the capital market,” Saylor said. The pitch to savers is equally blunt: the “better bank” is one that strips out duration and pays a spread over the fiat status quo, funded by over-collateralized Bitcoin. He sketched it in operational terms: raise equity, buy Bitcoin, then sell short-duration, BTC-secured credit “that just strips the duration to one month… and give people 500 basis points more yield than the risk-free rate in the capital market where you’re selling the credit.” The scale he envisions is not modest. Saylor walked through jurisdictions where financial repression or chronically low policy rates amplify the spread, arguing that mature markets with suppressed yields are the ripest soil for “pure-play digital credit issuers.” Switzerland and Japan were his canonical examples. The aspiration, however, is global. “What if there’s a hundred trillion dollars of digital credit and… 200 trillion worth of digital capital,” he asked, emphasizing that such a structure could remain over-collateralized rather than drift into fractional banking. He also pressed the geopolitical logic: corporate treasuries and well-capitalized exchanges, miners, and custodians become the “first line of economic defense,” lobbying and normalizing Bitcoin within domestic rule-sets the way incumbent industries do. “If you want to win the monetary war you need the institutions that control all the capital and… the support of the government,” he said. Bitcoin Treasury Companies Will Be Banks Saylor was explicit that corporate adoption is already compounding. He traced the cohort of publicly traded balance sheets holding BTC from a single firm in 2020— MicroStrategy —to “two or three… then 10… then 20… then 40… about a year ago there were 60… three months ago there were 120 and right now there’s more than 180,” with the target trajectory moving from “100 to a thousand to 10,000 to 100,000.” He blended that diffusion story with the platform thesis—Bitcoin built natively into iOS, Android, Windows, and consumer hardware—arguing that operating-system-level support is the other clear signal that “digital energy” has fused with the fabric of commerce. Asked about the distributional critique—that corporations crowd out individuals—Saylor inverted the premise, claiming institutional flows have largely accrued to early holders. “When we got involved, Bitcoin was trading $9,000 a coin… today Bitcoin’s $115,000,” he said, attributing much of the appreciation to corporate and ETF demand . “That means that 93% of the gain… went to the individuals that owned the Bitcoin before the corporations got involved.” The rhetoric can be martial—Saylor calls it a “protocol war”—but his operational discipline hinges on avoiding the traps that wrecked miners in the last cycle. Short and expensive liabilities layered onto depreciating hardware was, in his view, the fatal mismatch. The treasury archetype he champions favors mid-to-longer duration capital structures tied to an appreciating base asset. “If you take a mid-duration or long-duration loan and buy an asset appreciating 30 to 60% a year, you’ll probably be fine,” he said, dismissing M&A diversification as value-destructive opacity compared to the “perfect partner” of simply buying more BTC at “one times revenue.” Saylor On US Policy Saylor also pushed the policy and infrastructure horizon, predicting a phased legitimization of tokenized assets while stressing that the “greatest regulatory clarity” remains BTC’s status as a digital commodity that can sit on balance sheets and collateralize credit. He summarized the new political posture in Washington as supportive of making the US a “ global Bitcoin superpower ”—not by nationalizing miners or acquiring equity stakes, but by mainstreaming custody, collateralization, lending, operating-system integration, and tax treatment. “They want the finance companies in the United States to lead the way… and the finance companies in the United States to lead the way in digital assets and digital capital and Bitcoin adoption,” he said. For a community accustomed to debating halvings, hash rate, or on-chain heuristics, Saylor’s endgame centers elsewhere: indexes, coupons, tenors, and yield curves—all re-denominated atop a new monetary base. It is a corporate finance thesis at Bitcoin’s core. And it doubles as a provocation to boards and CFOs in every currency regime: “For every company in the world in any capital market, they’re always better off to buy Bitcoin as their capital asset,” he said. The rest is execution at scale. “Get to a trillion dollars of collateral growing 30% a year, be issuing $100 billion of credit a year, growing 20, 30% a year,” Saylor concluded. “We’re building a better bank.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $116,492.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|FIAT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-02 02:00:41

Gold’s sprint to fresh records near $3,875–$3,895/oz underlined the flight-to-safety backdrop, but BTC’s two-day rebound from $112,000 suggests buyers are treating macro uncertainty as a dip-buying opportunity. BTC's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Bitcoin ETF Inflows, “Uptober” Tailwinds, and a Bull-Flag Setup Fueling the rally, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $3.53 billion in net inflows in September, topped by $429.9 million on Sept. 30 (BlackRock, Ark, Fidelity leading). On-chain and derivatives data indicate healthy conditions as leverage resets after the decline, funding levels normalize, and open interest remains steady, allowing BTC to resume its upward trend. Technical analysts point to a multi-week bull flag with the price now pushing against the upper boundary, mirroring patterns seen before previous impulsive moves. Seasonality also favors the market, with “Uptober” traditionally showing strong performance after a positive September close. Telegram’s Pavel Durov even revived long-term optimism, reaffirming a $1 million BTC target driven by fixed supply versus money printing, sentiment often seen during mid-cycle expansions. Bitcoin’s Key Levels to Watch Out In the near term, Bitcoin resistance is around $117,500. A clear reclaim and daily close above this level could pave the way toward $119,300–$120,300, with a psychological target near $ 120,000. Order-book heatmaps indicate significant short liquidity between $118,000 and $119,000 (about $7 billion), which could trigger a squeeze if this level is broken. On the downside, bulls aim to defend the $114,800–$115,200 zone first, then the $112,000 pivot identified before the bounce; below that, there’s a larger liquidity pocket at $107,000–$108,000 (roughly $8 billion in long liquidations).

Binance Coin (BNB) demonstrates firm momentum, defending the $900 base after a decisive breakout above the $670 ceiling. Continued strength and rising futures open interest suggest a clear path toward $1,050 — break and sustained follow-through could target $1,200 and $1,600. What is driving the BNB price breakout? BNB price strength is driven by renewed accumulation after breaking the $670 resistance, higher trading volumes and expanding futures open interest, which together reflect increased speculative confidence and stronger buyer conviction above the $900 support level. How can traders interpret technical levels and market signals? Short-term technical structure shows consolidation above $900 with immediate resistance at $1,050. Key signals to monitor: rising open interest (currently ~ $1.82B), positive funding rates across most venues, and healthy spot volume (~ $240.8M). These factors suggest momentum, but abrupt funding spikes (e.g., Gate.io) can precede short corrections. Breakout Momentum Gathers Pace After months confined to a $570–$670 range, BNB recorded a meaningful breakout in mid-2025 that pushed price action higher on above-average volume and clear buying pressure. That shift marks a structural change from range-bound trading to trend-seeking behavior. Source: Ali Charts Via X BNB is trading around $1,011, up roughly 4% on the day, with a one‑month gain near 17% and a 90‑day return of about 54%. The prior resistance near $770 has shifted to support, reinforcing the bullish base. $1,050 Resistance in Focus The $1,050 zone has produced repeated seller reactions, evidenced by recent wicks. A clean, sustained close above $1,050 is the technical trigger many traders will use to target the next levels at $1,200 and $1,600. Conversely, losing $900 would weaken the bullish setup. Market data points to elevated participation: futures open interest sits at approximately $1.82 billion (Coinglass data referenced as plain text), 24‑hour futures volume reached $1.71 billion with Binance accounting for a large share, and spot volume remains healthy at roughly $240.8 million. Funding rates are mostly positive; Gate.io’s spike near 10.59% highlights potential short-term overleverage. Market Cap Consolidates After Profit-Taking BNB’s market capitalization rallied toward $150B after the breakout before facing profit-taking. It retraced below $138B and is now consolidating around $135B. A push above $138B would likely validate further upside toward $144B and higher, while a drop under $134B could prompt a test of $130B. How should traders manage risk around a BNB breakout? 1) Set a protective stop below the $900 support to preserve structure. 2) Scale position size on a confirmed close above $1,050. 3) Monitor funding rates and open interest for signs of overheating. 4) Use trailing stops if momentum accelerates to $1,200 or beyond. Frequently Asked Questions What price levels should traders watch for BNB in the short term? Key levels: support at $900 and $770; immediate resistance at $1,050. A sustained close above $1,050 targets $1,200 and $1,600, while losing $900 could prompt a retest of $770 and lower support zones. Is rising open interest bullish for Binance Coin? Rising open interest typically signals increased leverage and trader commitment, which can support bullish moves. However, sudden funding spikes may precede short-term corrections, so watch open interest alongside funding rates and volume. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/articles/bnb-breakout-2025"" }, ""headline"": ""BNB price holds above $900 as bulls defend support; $1,050 resistance in focus"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-2-1024x716.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""BNB price holds above $900 support and tests $1,050 resistance; open interest and volume suggest bullish momentum with targets at $1,200 and $1,600.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is driving the BNB price breakout?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Renewed accumulation after breaking the $670 ceiling, higher trading volumes and expanding futures open interest are driving the breakout, supported by strong $900-level demand."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Which technical levels matter most for BNB now?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Support at $900 and $770, with immediate resistance at $1,050.

The leading cryptocurrency has risen nearly 4% in the past 24 hours, with prices briefly rising to $119,455 for the first time since mid-August, CoinDesk data show. Other major tokens such as ether (ETH), XRP (XRP), solana (SOL) and dogecoin (DOGE) have risen 4% to 7%. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) has jumped 5% to 4,217 points. The rally follows a U.S. government shutdown on Wednesday after a deeply divided Congress prevented officials from reaching a funding deal. The shutdown could delay Friday's nonfarm payrolls report, the official monthly jobs figure, which would eventually set the stage for a positive liquidity impulse or expansion of liquidity in the financial system. This often results in easier access to funding, reduces cost of borrowing and encourages economic growth and risk-taking in financial markets. ""If ADP is a leading signal and the BLS print is delayed, the Fed is likely to deliver a 25 bp cut in October and pair it with guidance that keeps a second cut on the table by December, alongside an early nod toward tapering quantitative tightening (QT). That mix should pull real yields lower and soften the dollar into Q4, with a mild bear-steepening in the curve and gold staying bid. Net effect: a positive liquidity impulse that historically supports BTC,"" Matt Mena, Crypto Research Strategist at 21Shares said in an email. Wednesday's ADP private payrolls report painted a bleak picture of the labor market, strengthening the case for continued rate cuts by the Fed. The central bank cut rates by 25 basis points last month, while hinting at additional easing in the coming months. Mena added that BTC's price gain in the wake of the government shutdown could be a hint of an impending explosive rally. ""The message is clear: with traditional data releases in flux and macro uncertainty running high, Bitcoin remains one of the few assets that thrives when the old playbook breaks down. Investors should be watching this moment closely - it could mark the next explosive leg higher in crypto markets,"" he noted. Options look cheap One way to play the impending big move, while being hedged, could be through Deribit-listed options, which look cheap at the front-end, according to Amberdata's Director of Derivatives Greg Magadini. ""After a long 'dry spell' for BTC volatility, the U.S. government shutdown could finally be the catalyst to make BTC move a lot,"" Magadini told CoinDesk. ""This, coupled with the steep contango in implied volatility term structure, makes options look cheap."" The steep contango in the implied volatility (IV) term structure, represented by an upward-sloping IV curve from near-term to longer-term maturities, indicates that the market expects future volatility to be significantly higher than the near-term volatility. This makes near-term options relatively cheap. Option prices are influenced by implied volatility. Magadini cited long straddle as one of the preferred strategies to play the impending volatility boom. It involves the simultaneous purchase of both call and put options at the same strike price and with the same expiry. The call option gains value when the underlying asset’s price rises, while the put option provides protection against price declines. Together, this means the straddle buyer profits from significant price movements in either direction. ""The USD is likely to see flows on the back of the Shutdown and this week's payroll number... which will guide the Fed. These catalysts could either cause BTC to rally (as a dollar hedge) or crash (if risk assets panic),"" he said, explaining the bias for straddle.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|cryptocurrencies|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-02 02:14:52

The recent introduction of new listing standards is also adding further uncertainty to the timeline because the experts don’t know how quickly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will act under the new rules. Shutdown Risk Stalls Crypto ETF Momentum Over the last few months, several asset managers have been actively engaging with the SEC and updating their S-1 registration forms. These revisions are often seen as a sign that the regulator is getting closer to giving the green light for an investment product. However, a federal shutdown would pause most of this progress. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, wrote on X that three issuers believe next week could be a realistic window for a spot SOL ETF green light, though he cautioned that government closure might disrupt the process. James Seyffart shared the same sentiment, suggesting that things could get “wonky.” Congress has yet to reach an agreement on the budget for the new fiscal year, and if the deadline passes without a deal, the U.S. government will face a shutdown. This would force many federal agencies, including the SEC, to suspend most of their operations until funding is restored. The financial watchdog confirmed in a September 30 statement that if the government comes to a standstill, it will be unable to fast-track the approval of registration statements like S-1 filings. In such a situation, the SEC’s database would continue to receive submissions, but staff furloughs would mean suspending non-essential reviews. Since crypto ETFs are unlikely to be considered “essential,” their review process would be put on hold until normal operations resume. New Listing Guidelines Could Affect Timeline A possible government closure is not the only factor shaping the launch schedule for these investment products. Journalist Eleanor Terrett reported that the SEC has asked LTC, XRP, SOL, ADA, and DOGE ETF issuers to withdraw their 19b-4 filings since these are no longer required under the new generic listing standards. She also said that withdrawals could begin soon, although it is still unclear how quickly the regulator will act on pending applications under the new rules. Under the previous process, deadlines for several ETFs, including SOL, XRP, and DOGE, were supposed to begin this month. Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, CoinShares, Bitwise, Grayscale, VanEck, and Canary Capital are currently in the race to launch spot SOL ETFs, with the firms submitting amended S-1 documents that also include staking provisions to the SEC last week. Following the development, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas had said that approval odds for altcoin ETFs were “really 100% now.” The post Analysts Warn Government Closure May Delay Solana ETF Approval appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Crypto ETF|SEC|Solana|United States,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|DOGE,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-02 02:20:00

Tenev told the crowd at the Token2049 conference in Singapore that tokenization is a “freight train” barreling toward the heart of traditional finance. “Crypto and traditional finance have been living in separate worlds, but they’ll fully merge. In the future, everything will be on-chain in some form, and the distinction will disappear,” he said. With Robinhood now offering tokenized stocks in Europe as well as private shares in some of the hottest non-public startups like OpenAI , the firm is betting big on a future where assets trade 24/7, on-chain, and globally. “In the same way that stablecoins have become the default way to get digital access to dollars, tokenized stocks will become the default way for people outside the U.S. to get exposure to American equities,"" Tenev said on stage. ""That’s why we launched our stock tokens in Europe first, it’s the future of how global investors will hold U.S. assets.” Even though many in the crypto industry have praised the direction the U.S. is going on digital asset policy, Tenev said the country needs to play regulatory catch-up to Europe. There's no urgency to change things – such as creating regulations to facilitate 24/7 trading of tokenized stocks – because the current system works well enough already. Tenev compared it to the lack of high-speed trains in the U.S., something ubiquitous in Europe and Asia. “The biggest challenge in the U.S. is that the financial system basically works. It’s why we don’t have bullet trains — medium-speed trains get you there well enough,"" he said. ""So the incremental effort to move to fully tokenized will just take longer.” Tokenizing real estate Next up for Robinhood is tokenizing real estate. Tenev told the crowd that tokenizing property is “mechanically” no different from tokenizing a private company, such as SpaceX or OpenAI: you place the assets into a company structure and then issue tokens against it. While OpenAI called the move to tokenize its private shares "" unauthorized "" and crypto lawyers that spoke to CoinDesk said the move walked a legal tightrope , Tenev dismissed the controversy as part of a broader regulatory lag, arguing that the main hurdles aren’t technical but legal. Europe is already moving ahead, he said, while the U.S. will likely trail, but he framed real estate as the next logical step in Robinhood’s tokenization push — an asset class that could one day be traded as easily as a stock or stablecoin.

SEC pause halts non-emergency reviews of ETF filings during the shutdown. More than 90 spot and altcoin ETF applications are affected, including Solana- and XRP-focused funds. Bitcoin ETFs now manage about $150B AUM; Ethereum funds exceed $22B, per CoinGlass analytics. Meta description: SEC halts review of spot crypto ETF applications amid government shutdown; investors should expect delays. Read key impacts and next steps from COINOTAG. What does the SEC pause mean for spot crypto ETF approvals? The SEC has halted non-emergency review and approval of financial products during the partial government shutdown, meaning applications for spot crypto ETFs — including proposals tied to Solana, XRP, Cardano, Litecoin and Dogecoin — will be delayed until the agency restores full staffing and funding. How many ETF applications are affected and which tokens are involved? The SEC is currently processing more than 90 applications for ETFs based on spot prices of altcoins, token combinations and other digital-asset strategies. Issuers have proposed funds tied to Solana, XRP, Cardano, Litecoin, Dogecoin and other tokens. Bloomberg analysts had flagged Solana-focused approvals as likely earlier in October, but the shutdown makes that timeline uncertain. Why did the SEC suspend reviews during the shutdown? Under its contingency operations plan, the SEC limited personnel and paused routine, non-emergency support and reviews to preserve essential functions during a lapse in appropriations. The agency described the suspension as temporary “until further notice” while Congress resolves the budget impasse. What is the market context for these ETF filings? The rush of filings follows strong investor demand driven by the success of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. According to CoinGlass analytics, 11 Bitcoin funds now manage roughly $150 billion in assets under management (AUM). Ethereum spot funds have surpassed $22 billion in AUM. Solana’s market cap sits above $118 billion , and the token recently traded above $222 amid a broader crypto market upswing. What are experts saying about the delay? Industry observers warned of immediate impact. Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted the market was anticipating “crypto ETF approval season.” ETF Institute co-founder Nate Geraci commented that a shutdown “would definitely impact the launch of new spot crypto ETFs,” noting that planned timelines such as an October rollout—dubbed “ETF Cryptober” by some—may be postponed. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/sec-halts-review-spot-crypto-etf-applications"" }, ""headline"": ""SEC Halts Review of Spot Crypto ETF Applications During Government Shutdown"", ""description"": ""The SEC paused non-emergency reviews of more than 90 spot and altcoin ETF applications amid a partial government shutdown, delaying expected approvals."", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will the SEC resume ETF reviews once the shutdown ends?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

The SEC pause pauses active review and approval processes, so any planned launch dates tied to pending approvals are likely to shift. Issuers and market participants should expect delays until the agency returns to full operations. How long will approvals be delayed? Duration depends on how quickly Congress resolves the budget impasse. The SEC has stated reviews are suspended “until further notice,” but historically such pauses end once appropriations are restored; there is no fixed timeline. Key Takeaways Immediate delay : The SEC paused non-emergency ETF reviews during the shutdown, affecting 90+ applications. Market context : Bitcoin ETFs manage ~ $150B AUM; Ethereum funds exceed $22B, highlighting strong investor demand. Next steps : Monitor SEC notices, issuer updates, and filing records; expect approvals to resume after funding is restored. Conclusion The SEC’s suspension of non-emergency reviews amid the partial government shutdown has put a temporary hold on approvals for spot crypto ETF applications, including many altcoin proposals. Investors and issuers should monitor official SEC statements and filing records.

Bitcoin forms a bullish flag, with analysts eyeing $140K and Fibonacci targets near $166K. On-chain data shows buyer dominance as Spot Taker CVD flips positive after mid-July. October and November are viewed as breakout months, backed by seasonal strength and liquidity. Bitcoin is showing chart structures that align with another bullish rally. Current technical formations reveal a bullish flag pattern , and analysts point to October and November as potential catalysts for stronger upward momentum. Market participants are tracking key levels while historical data supports seasonal strength in this period. What does the bullish flag formation mean for Bitcoin price targets? Bitcoin has moved inside a descending channel since August 2023, forming a corrective flag that often precedes continuation. Analysts project an initial target near $140,000 with extended Fibonacci projections up to $166,546 if resistance breaks decisively. Captain Faibik’s charting highlights consistency with prior consolidations that preceded major rallies. Support and resistance within the channel continue to dictate near‑term price action and risk management levels. $BTC is getting Ready for Another Bullish Rally.. I think October & November are gonna be Bullish Months.. Before the Breakout, if we get a dip, that would be a very good Opportunity.. #Crypto #Bitcoin #BTCUSD pic.twitter.com/Kt3UTl1VLv — Captain Faibik (Twitter) October 1, 2025 Technical projections indicate that once resistance breaks, price expansion could target the $140,000 level. Earlier in 2023, Bitcoin exited a similar descending channel and delivered a sharp upward continuation. The repeating behavior signals alignment with a continuation pattern that has appeared across multiple market cycles. Source: KamranAsghar (X) Kamran Asghar also mapped Fibonacci extension targets that reinforce these levels. His analysis showed resistance near $127,568 , extending toward $142,831 and $166,546 . This sequence reflects progressively higher projections, supported by the ongoing formation of higher highs and higher lows in the daily chart. How do liquidity and seasonal patterns support a breakout? Bitcoin is currently trading at $116,702, recording a 3.16 percent increase in 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Daily trading volume stood at $62.75 billion, with circulating supply at 19.92 million BTC and market capitalization near $2.32 trillion — metrics that point to strong liquidity. Source: CoinMarketCap On‑chain indicators show steady accumulation across exchanges, with the Spot Taker CVD flipping positive since mid‑July. This metric captures the balance between aggressive buying and selling; the current positive trend confirms buyer dominance. At the same time, the Coinbase premium index indicates persistent spot demand from U.S. investors. Historical seasonality also matters: when Bitcoin ends September positively, subsequent multi‑month rallies are more common. October — often called “Uptober” — has averaged gains exceeding 20 percent in multiple years. With the flag intact and seasonal momentum approaching, analysts assign higher odds to breakouts in October and November. Frequently Asked Questions What entry and stop levels do analysts recommend for a flag breakout? Traders commonly enter on a confirmed daily close above channel resistance with stop losses below the recent flag low. Initial profit targets use the flagpole height, then Fibonacci extensions for extended targets such as $142k and $166k. How reliable is Spot Taker CVD for confirming breakouts? Spot Taker CVD is a directional liquidity indicator; a sustained positive flip suggests net buying pressure and improves breakout reliability when combined with price and volume confirmation. Key Takeaways Bullish flag identified : A descending channel since August reads as a continuation pattern with a $140K initial target. On‑chain confirmation : Spot Taker CVD flipping positive signals buyer dominance supporting sustainable moves. Seasonal and liquidity edge : Strong trading volume and historical October–November strength increase breakout probability; use progressive Fibonacci targets and risk management. Conclusion This analysis finds that the Bitcoin bullish flag , reinforced by Fibonacci projections and positive on‑chain indicators, supports a plausible path toward $140,000 and higher extensions. Traders should combine technical breakout confirmation with on‑chain signals and seasonal context, and monitor liquidity and volume for sustained moves.",Analysis|Bitcoin|News|BTC,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-02 02:55:59

Bitcoin Rises Despite US Government Shutdown The US federal government shut down at midnight on September 30, as President Donald Trump and Congress failed to reach a deal on funding. Specifically, the two camps were at odds over enhanced Obamacare subsidies, with neither party willing to take the blame. Related Reading: Bitcoin Momentum Indicator: Why 600,000 Transactions Threshold Matters Most However, Bitcoin made a surprise move to the upside despite the uncertain environment created by the US government shutdown, recording strong gains earlier today. CryptoQuant analyst Kripto Mevsimi stated that September saw deeper losses among short-term holders (STH), as their Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) fell as low as 0.992. As a result, most of September was marked by STH continuing to sell their BTC holdings at a loss. However, the metric recovered slightly to 0.995, although it is still below August’s reading of 0.998. The current STH-SOPR reading is showing signs of stabilization after a period of depression. It is interesting to note the timing of this recovery, as it occurred at a time when BTC is trading in the high $110,000 range, slightly below a heavy resistance zone. Past data shows two potential scenarios that can happen following such a reset in the STH-SOPR. First, it could be early warning signs of a weakening momentum for BTC, as extended loss realization can precede corrective phases where weak hands capitulate. The other, more bullish scenario, is that it could be a healthy reset. Quick absorption of realized losses often paves the way for more sustainable rallies, which could catapult BTC to new all-time highs (ATH) in the near term. The CryptoQuant analyst added: With BTC consolidating under resistance, this rebound in STH-SOPR is a key barometer of market health. If buyers continue to absorb weak-hand selling, it could mirror past resets that paved the way for the next leg higher. Will BTC Decline In Q4 2025? While the dwindling active circulating supply of Bitcoin offers some hope to the bulls, others are not as optimistic. According to recent analysis by fellow CryptoQuant contributor Axel Adler, demand for BTC cooled after it failed to hold above $115,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Go To Zero, Hedge Fund CEO Warns Meanwhile, crypto analyst Doctor Profit recently remarked that BTC is likely to experience another 20% decline from its current price, reaching his projected target range between $90,000 – $94,000. At press time, BTC trades at $117,226, up 3.5% in the past 24 hours.

World Liberty Financial To Launch Debit Card Pilot Program During a presentation at the Token 2049 conference in Singapore, World Liberty Financial’s CEO, Zach Witkoff, shared these developments alongside co-founder Donald Trump Jr., highlighting the company’s commitment to bridging cryptocurrency with everyday transactions. Witkoff revealed that the forthcoming debit card, designed to facilitate crypto asset spending in daily life, is set to enter a pilot program in the next quarter, with a launch anticipated either in the fourth quarter of this year or the first quarter of 2026. This announcement follows previous hints from Zak Folkman, World Liberty Financial’s co-founder, about a debit card and retail application during Korea Blockchain Week 2025 , although the details of the consumer app remain under wraps for now. In addition to the debit card, Witkoff emphasized the company’s focus on the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). “We’ve not only thought about it, we’re actively working on it,” he stated, noting that assets such as oil, gas, cotton, and timber could benefit from being traded on-chain. As part of its roadmap, the firm also introduced a stablecoin called USD1 . Since its launch, USD1 has rapidly ascended to become the fifth-largest stablecoin globally, boasting a market capitalization of approximately $2.7 billion. USD1’s Role Amid Political Scrutiny In response to President Donald Trump being scrutinized by Democratic lawmakers in the US, Donald Trump Jr. emphasized the venture and USD1’s role in supporting US treasuries and maintaining the dollar’s global dominance. He stated: We’re flying to every single corner of this globe, convincing people to onboard to USD1, which, in effect, convinces those people to go buy US Treasuries, and it’s great for the US dollar. WLFI also announced plans to expand the USD1 stablecoin onto the Aptos (APT) blockchain. Despite facing challenges, including subdued demand on centralized exchanges (CEXs), the stablecoin has gained traction on decentralized platforms, although concerns remain regarding liquidity concentration among a few major wallets. In August of this year, World Liberty Financial revealed a partnership with the technology firm ALT5 Sigma. As part of a treasury strategy, ALT5 Sigma will acquire substantial amounts of WLFI tokens, following Strategy’s (formerly MicroStrategy) acquisition of Bitcoin. On Wednesday, WLFI posted gains of 2%, reaching the $0.200 mark, which has proven to be a major obstacle for the token’s price, as it has been unable to surpass this level for several days.

In the video , an Eastnets representative explained how the company’s PaymentSafe platform serves as a payment hub capable of unifying transactions across domestic, international, and SWIFT networks. The speaker described PaymentSafe’s universal translator as critical for exchanging different payment formats, mentioning the legacy MT standard alongside the ISO 20022 format , including CBPR+. SMQKE shared the video with a caption that asserted that Ripple is “actively being integrated into SWIFT,” emphasizing that third-party partnerships such as EastNet and Ripple, “are key to enabling XRP to move across the SWIFT network as an ISO 20022-compliant asset.” This remark has framed the discussion about how Ripple’s technology can function within long-standing banking infrastructure. RIPPLE IS ACTIVELY BEING INTEGRATED INTO SWIFT Third-party partnerships like Eastnets and Ripple are key to enabling XRP to move across the SWIFT network as an ISO 20022-compliant asset. Eastnets’ PaymentSafe platform connects Ripple’s blockchain technology with SWIFT’s… pic.twitter.com/2fsEpeH8NR — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 30, 2025 PaymentSafe’s Role in Bridging Networks The remarks in the video placed PaymentSafe at the center of ongoing efforts to align blockchain-based payment solutions with traditional rails. By acting as a translator for payment formats, PaymentSafe facilitates smoother Straight-Through Processing (STP) for financial institutions. Its compliance with ISO 20022 enables interoperability between newer blockchain systems like Ripple and legacy infrastructures, such as SWIFT, which continue to rely on MT messages during their transition. According to SMQKE, this configuration “ connects Ripple’s blockchain technology with SWIFT’s traditional financial systems.” The post further claimed that the integration enables XRP to act as a bridge currency, facilitating cross-border payments through SWIFT’s global network. Emphasis on Seamless Integration for Banks The post highlighted the adoption of innovative technologies without overhauling their existing frameworks as a shared priority among financial institutions. PaymentSafe’s hub reportedly enables banks to tap into Ripple’s blockchain without disrupting established processes. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This point is a strategic advantage for institutions that are cautious about moving away from entrenched payment structures while seeking faster, lower-cost cross-border settlements. Positioning XRP as a Bridge Currency The narrative from SMQKE’s post aligns with a growing perception that XRP can serve as an efficient bridge currency and settlement asset for global transfers. As international banking continues to move toward ISO 20022 standards, partnerships that bring together traditional payment networks and blockchain solutions appear increasingly relevant. With platforms like PaymentSafe facilitating communication between the SWIFT network and Ripple’s blockchain, the opportunity to expand XRP’s role in settlement appears more feasible for institutions reluctant to adopt entirely new infrastructures.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.7092 Market cap $750.94M Trading volume (24-hour) $23.98M Circulating supply 1.06B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.7101 24-hour low $0.6699 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 5.39% 50-day SMA $0.7561 14-Day RSI 35.78 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Green days 17/30 (57%) 200-day SMA $0.7040 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Tezos has rebounded from $0.63 and is now testing the $0.72 resistance zone. The daily MACD is nearing a bullish crossover, signaling growing momentum. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart On the daily timeframe for October 2, Tezos (XTZ) is trading at $0.708, pushing into the mid-Bollinger resistance at $0.723 after bouncing strongly from the lower band support at $0.630. The MACD is on the verge of a bullish crossover, sitting almost flat, suggesting that momentum is gradually shifting to the upside. The OBV has ticked higher, indicating improving volume backing the current push. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView If XTZ secures a daily close above $0.723, the next upside target lies at the upper Bollinger level near $0.815. However, failure to clear this resistance could result in a retest of $0.685–$0.690, with deeper support located at $0.630. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, Tezos has staged a steady rally from $0.660 to $0.709, forming higher lows and higher highs. The Alligator lines are widening, signaling that the short-term uptrend is gaining strength. RSI is at 69, just a touch below overbought, meaning momentum remains positive but could face short-term cooling if buyers slow down. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView Support lies at $0.690–$0.687, which has now flipped into a key level to watch. As long as XTZ holds above that range, continuation toward $0.720–$0.725 is expected. A strong breakout there would confirm the daily view, targeting $0.760 and higher. If XTZ is rejected at $0.720–$0.725, the price may consolidate between $0.685 and $0.705 before another move. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6943 BUY SMA 5 $0.6973 BUY SMA 10 $0.7119 SELL SMA 21 $0.7430 SELL SMA 50 $0.7561 SELL SMA 100 $0.7344 SELL SMA 200 $0.7040 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7172 SELL EMA 5 $0.7277 SELL EMA 10 $0.7487 SELL EMA 21 $0.7756 SELL EMA 50 $0.7714 SELL EMA 100 $0.7378 SELL EMA 200 $0.7442 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos is showing breakout strength after a strong rebound, but the $0.72 level is the key level to watch. A clear break above it could extend gains toward $0.76 and potentially $0.81, while failure there risks a pullback to $0.685–$0.690. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin recovered in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite its partnership milestones, Tezos (XTZ) had a bearish 2024. The coin peaked at $1.4 in April but dropped about 60% by August. Buyers returned in September, driving the price to $0.7015, and momentum carried into November with a peak of $1.856.

Broad altcoin season unlikely: Bitcoin-led rallies are not spilling over to most altcoins. Market cycles are shorter and narrative-driven; only sector-specific tokens may outperform.

Altcoin season appears unlikely in the short term, says Bitget operating chief Vugar Usi Zade. Bitcoin’s independent rally and a lack of major technological catalysts for altcoins reduce the probability that “everything will go up” together. How is Bitcoin decoupling affecting altcoins? Bitcoin’s rally has increasingly operated independently, weakening historical correlations with altcoins. According to on-stage comments at Token2049, Bitcoin can be green while the broader market is red — funds are not cascading from BTC into altcoins as before. Market-share data shows Bitcoin at about 58% dominance while Ether sits near 12% (CoinMarketCap). This concentration limits capital rotation into smaller tokens without clear, narrative-driven catalysts. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/2025/10/02/altcoin-season-bitget-usi-zade"" }, ""headline"": ""Altcoin season unlikely as Bitcoin decouples — Bitget executive analysis"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199a2da-e86d-705f-a6b4-b70b579284b1.jpeg""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T10:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T10:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Bitget operating chief Vugar Usi Zade says a broad altcoin season is unlikely as Bitcoin decouples and projects lack major technological catalysts.""} A broad altcoin rally is unlikely, as crypto projects haven’t generated enough excitement to stir traders into action, Bitget operating chief Vugar Usi Zade tells Cointelegraph. The crypto markets are unlikely to see an altcoin season where “everything will go up,” as many traders are now focused on narrower trends or are just focusing solely on Bitcoin, according to Bitget operating chief Vugar Usi Zade. “I don’t think there will be an altseason,” Usi Zade told Cointelegraph at the Token2049 conference in Singapore on Wednesday. “The whole idea that ‘this is altseason and everything will go up because it’s altseason,’ we won’t see that, and I’m very firm in that,” he said. “I don’t think we will see that huge pump, unfortunately, because there’s no logical reason behind it.” “There haven’t been any technological advancements. We haven’t seen any big things coming out of projects. Why would the price go up? Just because now it is the time? It’s not.” Historically, altcoins — crypto tokens other than Bitcoin (BTC) — have rallied alongside Bitcoin. Altcoin season refers to periods when altcoins outperform Bitcoin due to higher risk-to-reward profiles. Why are crypto “seasons” changing? Usi Zade said the crypto market is “moving very much away from seasons,” shifting toward shorter, more frequent cycles. Bitcoin no longer reliably drags the rest of the market up. “Bitcoin is its own rally; its impact is almost zero on the rest of the market,” he said. “Bitcoin decoupled not only from the stock market, but it also decoupled from altcoins.” “We’ve seen so many instances that Bitcoin is the only one in the green, and then the entire market is red. Money is not flowing from Bitcoin down to the alts.” Vugar Usi Zade speaking on stage at Taipei Blockchain Week in September. Source: Vugar Usi Zade Rallies today are more likely to be narrative-driven. For example, tokens tied to real-world assets (RWA) may see concentrated gains while unrelated sectors remain flat. How must market attitudes change for sustainable altcoins? Usi Zade argues investors’ short-term mindset makes long-term project sustainability difficult. Expecting crypto ventures to reach profitability within months is unrealistic compared to legacy companies that took years. “It took Amazon more than 10 years to become profitable, and now we want a crypto venture to do that in eight months,” he said. That pressure forces projects to prioritize short-term token performance over product development. Unlike traditional exits where early investors sell to strategic firms, tokens are often immediately tradable by retail, increasing volatility and reducing runway for teams to build. “The token is a separate product. You need to work with the traders and make sure that you are traded and your price doesn’t go down because when your price reaches virtually zero, your product, or your project, is dead,” Usi Zade said. When should investors favor Bitcoin over altcoins? Many market participants now advise newcomers to hold Bitcoin only, abandoning the common 70/30 Bitcoin/Ether allocation. Usi Zade said that advice reflects Bitcoin’s sustained outperformance and Ether’s relative stability. Bitcoin’s near-term momentum and market dominance leave limited incentive for retail investors to shift into Ether or smaller tokens without clear catalysts. What data supports this market stance? Market-share figures show Bitcoin with roughly 58% dominance and Ether around 12% after recent shifts (CoinMarketCap). These percentages indicate concentrated capital and reduce the odds of a broad altcoin rally absent new developments. Key Takeaways Altcoin season unlikely: Widespread altcoin gains are improbable without tangible technological breakthroughs. Bitcoin decoupling: BTC often rallies independently, limiting capital flow into altcoins. Action for investors: Focus on Bitcoin or narrative-led tokens; expect shorter, sector-specific cycles. Frequently Asked Questions Will altcoins ever rally together again? Broad altcoin rallies require sustained technological or adoption catalysts across many projects. Without that, rallies will be sector-focused and short-lived. Is Bitcoin dominance permanent? Bitcoin dominance can fluctuate. Currently high dominance reflects capital concentration and BTC’s independent momentum, but narrative shifts or major tech advances could change that over time. How should a new investor allocate funds today? Conservative advice is to prioritize Bitcoin exposure and selectively add narrative-driven altcoins with clear fundamentals and roadmaps. Risk management and long-term horizons remain crucial. Conclusion Altcoin season appears constrained by Bitcoin’s decoupling and a lack of broad technological drivers. Traders should expect more targeted, narrative-led rallies rather than a blanket altseason. Monitor sector narratives, prioritize liquidity, and consider Bitcoin-heavy allocations while projects demonstrate sustained fundamentals. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to adapt your crypto portfolio when altcoin season is unlikely"", ""description"": ""Practical steps to reposition a portfolio in a market where altcoins are unlikely to rally broadly."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess current allocations"", ""text"": ""Review holdings and identify low-liquidity or underdeveloped altcoins that may underperform without catalysts."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Increase Bitcoin weighting"", ""text"": ""Shift a portion of capital to Bitcoin to capture core market momentum and reduce exposure to high-volatility altcoins."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Select narrative-led opportunities"", ""text"": ""Allocate small, research-driven positions to sectors with clear catalysts, such as RWA or infrastructure projects with proven roadmaps."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Maintain risk controls"", ""text"": ""Use position sizing, stop-losses, and regular rebalancing to protect capital during shorter, more frequent market cycles."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will altcoins ever rally together again?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Broad altcoin rallies require sustained technological or adoption catalysts across many projects.

Key point 1 – Proposal to study a national Bitcoin reserve and funding via seized crypto Key point 2 – MPs request the government reaffirm the Riksbank Act to signal no CBDC intent Key point 3 – Sweden has 85 crypto firms (Tracxn), and new confiscation rules allow seizure of crypto (Bitbo reference) Sweden Bitcoin reserve: Swedish MPs urge a study into a national Bitcoin reserve to hedge inflation and diversify assets; funding options, CBDC stance and policy impact explained. The proposal has come from two Swedish Democrats, a party that is a key player in backing the Swedish ruling coalition and its minority government. Two members of Sweden’s parliament, the Riksdag, have proposed that the country investigate establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve to tackle inflation and diversify its holdings. They also want the government to promise it won’t change the legislation governing the monetary policy of Sweden’s central bank, to show it doesn’t intend to introduce a digital central bank currency. In their proposal to the Riksdag on Wednesday, Swedish Democrats Dennis Dioukarev and David Perez said that, given other countries like the US are already in the process of creating a reserve, Sweden should “participate in this digital arms race and join the growing group of nations that accepted and recognized the potential of Bitcoin.” Similar to the US, Dioukarev and Perez have floated the idea of funding the reserve through seized Bitcoin, but said the decision on which authority will manage the Bitcoin (BTC) is an “open question,” for now. Sweden doesn’t have any publicly listed Bitcoin holdings, according to Bitbo. However, in November 2024 the country introduced a law allowing authorities to confiscate luxury items, including crypto, even if they aren’t the target of an investigation. Source: Jan3 Advocates for Bitcoin strategic reserves argue nation-state treasuries holding Bitcoin could help diversify reserve composition and reduce correlation with fiat-driven monetary policy risks. What is the Sweden Bitcoin reserve proposal? Sweden Bitcoin reserve refers to a parliamentary proposal by MPs Dennis Dioukarev and David Perez to study creating a state-level Bitcoin reserve as a complement to traditional currency and gold reserves. The proposal emphasizes hedging inflation, diversifying assets, and signaling support for digital innovation. How would Sweden fund and manage a Bitcoin reserve? Dioukarev and Perez suggested using seized crypto as a potential funding source, though they left the managing authority unspecified. Sweden’s recent confiscation laws (November 2024) permit authorities to seize crypto and luxury goods, providing a legal avenue for funding without new taxation. Market context: Tracxn lists 85 Swedish crypto firms, 20 of which raised roughly $48 million in venture capital and private funding. Bitcoin’s fixed 21 million supply and relative asset size (ranked among the top global assets) are cited as practical reasons for its reserve role. Swedish Democrats Dennis Dioukarev and David Perez want the government to establish a Bitcoin reserve. Source: Riksdag Why do proponents say a Bitcoin reserve matters? Proponents argue a Bitcoin reserve could reduce exposure to political, geopolitical and monetary policy risks that affect traditional reserves. They say Bitcoin’s decentralised protocol and capped supply can act as an inflation hedge, while ownership signals a national openness to digital innovation. “In contrast, Bitcoin’s value is not driven by the monetary policies of individual states or any specific economy, which can reduce the overall correlation in the reserve,” the proposal states. Will a Bitcoin reserve mean Sweden abandons a CBDC? Dioukarev and Perez explicitly requested the government promise not to change the Riksbank Act’s definition of legal tender, framing the reserve proposal alongside a commitment against adopting a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The Riksbank’s prior CBDC pilot (final report March 2024) concluded the decision is ultimately political. Human Rights Foundation data (CBDC tracker) highlights efficiency and inclusion benefits of CBDCs but warns of privacy and state-control risks—arguments cited by the MPs in advocating a non-CBDC path. Among the top five crypto companies operating in Sweden are an exchange and a cold wallet developer. Source: Tracxn Frequently Asked Questions How likely is Sweden to create a Bitcoin reserve? Probability depends on political support and fiscal review; the Swedish Democrats influence the minority government, but any move requires cross-party consensus and a framework for custody, valuation and accounting of crypto assets (40–50 words). Can seized crypto legally fund a national reserve? Yes, under November 2024 confiscation rules Sweden can seize crypto. Using seized assets to fund a reserve would require legislative clarity on valuation, legal title transfer and custodial arrangements to meet international accounting standards. What impact would a reserve have on Sweden’s monetary policy? A Bitcoin reserve would be a balance-sheet diversification rather than a monetary policy tool; the Riksbank would retain control over monetary policy if the Riksbank Act remains unchanged, as the MPs request. Key Takeaways Policy proposal : Two Swedish Democrats propose studying a national Bitcoin reserve to hedge inflation and diversify reserves. Funding options : Seized crypto is suggested as a funding source under new confiscation rules (Nov 2024). CBDC clarity : MPs want a government promise not to change the Riksbank Act to signal no CBDC adoption. Conclusion The Sweden Bitcoin reserve proposal signals growing national-level interest in crypto as a strategic reserve asset. With legal avenues for seized crypto and a vocal political actor supporting the idea, Sweden’s discussion may shape broader European debates on reserve diversification and CBDC policy.

Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Solana ETF Speculation Keeps Bulls Optimistic Ahead of October 10 The next major milestone for Solana is set to arrive on October 10, when the SEC is expected to decide on several spot Solana ETF applications. While reports suggest that regulators have asked some asset managers to withdraw filings tied to certain altcoins, analysts argue this is more of a procedural move than a rejection. Many believe October, already being dubbed “Cointober”, could see multiple crypto ETFs advance, echoing the pattern that fueled Ethereum’s breakout earlier this year. This ongoing ETF narrative, combined with Solana’s swift recovery from volatility, has helped maintain strong bullish sentiment among traders and institutions alike. On-Chain Tug-of-War: Veterans Take Profit, Newcomers Hold the Line Under the surface, Solana’s holder base is divided. Liveliness has increased, suggesting long-term holders (LTHs) are gaining strength after a three-month upward trend. At the same time, 1–3 month holders now control about 14.4% of the supply, the highest in five months, indicating growing short-term conviction. That “old guard vs. fresh capital” conflict has effectively kept the price above the rising trendline, even as profit-taking episodes occur. Institutional flows remain the key factor. Talk among market participants about asset-manager positioning ahead of an ETF decision, combined with ongoing builder activity in Solana DeFi, supports steady medium-term demand. If Bitcoin dominance diminishes, high-beta L1s like SOL typically attract additional flows. Will Solana Break $214 Resistance and Target $232? Technically, SOL regained its weekly median range after the flash crash, indicating underlying strength. Immediate support is at $206; breaking below it could open the door to $200, weakening the three-month bullish trend. Related Reading: Did Bitcoin Top?

52547643,595066,1759377653,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52547643.jpeg,Dogecoin Mining Gets $2.5M Boost From Trump-Linked Thumzup Media,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-mining-gets-2-5m-boost-from-trump-linked-thumzup-media/,"According to multiple reports, Thumzup Media Corporation has provided a $2.5 million loan to DogeHash Technologies to help expand Dogecoin mining operations. The cash is tied to an agreement that could turn into an all-stock acquisition, with DogeHash shareholders reportedly set to receive about 30.7 million Thumzup shares under the deal. That swap, based on the filings and press notes , may lead the combined company to adopt a new ticker and brand if the transaction closes. Thumzup Expands Mining Fleet Reports have disclosed the fresh funds will go toward buying and deploying more mining rigs. The plan calls for adding 500+ ASIC miners, which backers say would push the company’s active machines to over 4,000 by year end. That is a substantial jump from current levels. The company has also been building a treasury of Dogecoin. Based on reports, Thumzup has accumulated roughly 7.5 million DOGE at an estimated cost near $2 million. Share Swap And Possible Rebrand Sources indicate the proposed purchase is an all-share transaction rather than a cash sale. The 30.7 million share figure would give DogeHash holders a stake in Thumzup , and some statements suggest management expects to seek a new ticker — mentioned in rumor as “XDOG” — after closing. Timelines cited in disclosures point to a closing window in Q4, but that timing depends on regulatory checks and shareholder approvals. The change in focus from marketing services to crypto and mining is being framed by backers as a strategic shift for Thumzup’s business model. Regulatory And Execution Risks There are risks. Reports warn that delivering hundreds of ASIC units, securing power, and managing higher operating costs are not simple tasks. Mining difficulty and hardware supply chain delays could blunt the expected gains. Loan terms and final deal mechanics remain subject to due diligence. Also, while the news has been tied to the Trump family, the link is mainly through prior share purchases by Donald Trump Jr., not direct corporate control. Market And Shareholder Reaction Stock and crypto watchers reacted quickly. Some traders bid the shares and Dogecoin higher on the news, while others eyed the deal skeptically. Analysts pointed out that buying more miners does not guarantee profit if Dogecoin’s network conditions change or energy costs spike. Shareholders will look closely at the details of the loan, any future dilution, and the timeline for full integration of DogeHash into Thumzup.

The latest ones will allow the community to build their own DEX and AMM interfaces. Still in Testing Phase Dr. Chengdiao Fan (one of Pi Network’s co-founders) announced during the crypto conference TOKEN2049 in Singapore that the project has deployed new decentralized exchange (DEX) and automated market maker (AMM) liquidity pool features to its blockchains. They will enable developers and Pioneers to experiment directly with token swaps, liquidity pools, and other tools. Fan revealed that the features have been rolled out only on Testnet, and after the testing period, they will be accessible on Mainnet: “Mainnet restricts this functionality for now, but the interface in the Pi Wallet will display these options and link users to the Testnet environment. These features are innate on the protocol level of the Pi blockchain and allow the community to build their own DEX and AMM interfaces.” In addition, Fan explained that these tools will also enable Pioneers to educate themselves about DeFi before directly participating on Mainnet and interacting with real PI tokens. Following the latest update, developers can test coins on the Pi Testnet blockchain. Documentation explaining the entire process will be released in the coming weeks. The creation of tokens is crucial for these features to function properly. Developers are allowed to produce coins on the Pi Testnet blockchain, while such functionality is similarly restricted on Mainnet during the testing period. The End of the Domains Auction In mid-June, Pi Network’s team unveiled the .pi Domains Auction: a bidding event that enables Pioneers to acquire unique names, replacing long addresses consisting of numerous letters and numbers. The initiative officially concluded on September 30, and no new bids will be accepted after that date. However, the team explained that if a domain receives a bid within the last 24 hours of the auction, the window will automatically extend for another 24 hours. “If another bid occurs in the extended window, it will extend for an additional 24 hours, and so on. This rolling extension mechanism is as defined in the original Auction rules, and it ensures fairness for all Pioneers actively participating. At the close of the specific domain auctions, winning Pioneers will secure their bids for the domains they pursued.” The conclusion of the auction will be followed by a data review phase that will last approximately two months. After that, eligible users can start claiming their domains.

Futures volume and a near 2% rise in open interest show trader buildup, keeping ETH range-bound between $3,400–$4,400 until bulls close decisively above the 9-day EMA. ETH failing to close above 9-day EMA near $4,150 signals limited upside and risk of re-test to $3,400–$3,600. Futures volume jumped ~39% to $198B with open interest +1.91%, indicating position accumulation ahead of a big move. Historical Q4 strength after mixed Q3s raises odds of year-end rallies; ETH is +64% over 90 days, +23% YTD. Ethereum resistance at $4,150 stalls upside — ETH price outlook, futures signals, and Q4 scenarios explained. Read updated analysis and key levels. (Updated Oct 2025) Ethereum struggles at $4,150 resistance as bulls fight to hold momentum amid growing selling pressure. ETH faces strong rejection near $4,400, with moving averages now acting as resistance. Open interest jumps 1.91% amid rising volume, signaling trader buildup near $4K. Historical Q4 rallies follow stabilizing Q3s, raising expectations for another bullish run. Ethereum is stuck just below $4,150 resistance after losing support earlier this month. With mixed futures activity and weak momentum, traders are watching closely—will ETH break higher or fall back toward stronger support near $3,400–$3,600? What is causing Ethereum resistance near $4,150? Ethereum resistance near $4,150 is driven by short-term moving averages (9-day EMA, 50-day SMA) sitting above price and a layered supply zone around $4,400 where late buyers are exiting. These technical barriers, combined with mixed futures positioning, keep upward momentum muted until a confirmed close above key EMAs. How does futures open interest and volume influence ETH price action? Open interest rose ~1.91% while futures volume spiked ~39% to roughly $198 billion in a day, indicating fresh positioning. High volume with rising open interest usually signals conviction; here it suggests traders are betting on a directional move but remain split, as longs and shorts are near parity. This creates potential volatility around key levels. Source: AlphaCryptoSignal Via X Why does the $4,400 area act as a supply zone? Price clustering between $4,150 and $4,400 has produced trapped buyers who sold into weakness, turning that range into a supply zone. Moving averages above price add resistance, and rotation of profit-taking around those levels increases selling pressure. Historical trade flow and order-book snapshots (exchange-level data) support this assessment. When could ETH regain bullish momentum into Q4? ETH is more likely to regain clear bullish momentum after a sustained close above the 9-day EMA and then the 50-day SMA with rising volume and falling volatility. Historically, Q4 rallies have followed stabilizing Q3 action; past cases (2017, 2020, 2021, 2023) show stronger year-end flows and retail re-engagement supporting upside. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Ethereum struggles at $4,150 resistance as futures heat up and traders position for Q4"", ""description"": ""Ethereum resistance at $4,150 limits gains as moving averages and a $4,400 supply zone create selling pressure.

If ETH cannot sustain above the 9-day EMA, immediate support lies between $3,400 and $3,600. These bands historically hosted accumulation and are reinforced by layered buy orders and previous swing lows. How should traders interpret the recent rise in open interest? Rising open interest (≈+1.91%) with a sharp volume spike suggests traders are building positions ahead of a decisive move. Interpretation depends on whether volume favors longs or shorts; current data shows a near balance, implying potential volatility rather than a clear breakout. Key Takeaways Resistance pressure : Short-term moving averages and a $4,400 supply zone cap upside around $4,150. Futures buildup : Volume up ~39% and open interest +1.91% signal trader positioning and possible increased volatility. Q4 watch : Historical Q4 strength suggests upside potential if ETH reclaims key EMAs; monitor on-chain flows and volume for confirmation. Conclusion Ethereum resistance near $4,150 is the immediate technical battleground. Ethereum resistance , moving averages, and a clustered supply zone around $4,400 are the defining factors for near-term direction. With futures activity rising and historical Q4 patterns favoring year-end rallies, market participants should watch EMA closes, volume, and open interest for confirmation.

Buyers defended $2.93 multiple times as flows consolidated, with the October 18 ETF decision window now framing the next breakout test toward $3.00. News Background XRP climbed 5.2% over the 24-hour window from Oct. 1, 03:00 to Oct. 2, 02:00, advancing from $2.84 to $2.97. The move followed SBI’s launch of an XRP lending program for institutional payments, highlighting Japan’s push into large-scale adoption. The rally also comes as Ripple CTO David Schwartz transitions to an emeritus role and with seven spot ETF filings pending SEC decisions starting Oct. 18. Price Action Summary The token traded a $0.16 band (5.6% volatility) between $2.82 and $2.98. The breakout accelerated at 08:00 Oct. 1, as XRP ripped from $2.86 to $2.92 on 164.5M tokens — more than double the daily average. Subsequent consolidation held $2.93 support through multiple retests, while resistance firmed at $2.96–$2.98. In the final hour, XRP extended 0.28% from $2.96 to $2.97, hitting $2.98 before sellers capped the advance. Technical Analysis Support has shifted higher to $2.93 after repeated defenses, while resistance remains entrenched at $2.96–$2.98. The breakout was validated by volume spikes — including a 4.8M burst during the late-session rally — signaling institutional demand underpinning the move. The hour chart showed a textbook ascending structure, with higher lows at $2.96–$2.97 leading into the session peak. Bulls need a decisive close above $2.98 to confirm momentum toward the $3.00 psychological barrier. What Traders Are Watching?

Under Jamie’s leadership, Bitget enabled stablecoin payments through national and blockchain QR systems, such as VietQR in Vietnam and Solana Pay. It also partnered with AEON, Paydify to expand merchant acceptance. “Whether you’re in Vietnam, Philippines, Brazil, wherever you are in the world that accepts QR payment, you can now scan a QR code and pay directly using stablecoins, with your Bitget wallet,” said Jamie. He said that the best thing about the QR payment system is the fees within it. For instance, Brazil uses a system called Pix QR, a government initiative where users pay from, traditionally, their bank account. “Now, being able to pay directly with your Bitget wallet, you get a more competitive fee,” he noted. Stablecoins are “Clearly the Future” – Bitget CMO Bitget supports every single stablecoin when it comes to the QR payment feature, said Jamie. Just like Apple Pay or Google Pay, stablecoin payments are just a QR scan away, he added. Bitget, with over 60 million wallet users, partnered with payments giant Mastercard in July to launch a new crypto-linked card that allows users to make payments directly from their digital wallets at over 150 million merchants. “Right now, physical cards are coming in the near future,” Jamie noted, adding that it would allow users to instantly settle their transactions, buy coffee, and groceries, using their MasterCard. “Stablecoins are the future. We strongly believe that. I’ve even got a case. I bought my car using stablecoins in Dubai. The opportunities are endless, and they’re clearly the future.” Cross-Chain Stablecoins Are Real – Can They Reshape Global Financial System? Navigating stablecoins from chain to chain has traditionally involved “lots of barriers,” said Jamie. “You may have USDC on Base, and you want to move it across to USDC on BNB chain, for example, or any other. Now we’ve simplified that.” Further, he said that the gas fee is very minimal, if any at all, depending on the transaction in place. Bitget to Partner With ‘Biggest Names’ in Traditional Finance in Asia Jamie hinted that Bitget will come up with a “huge announcement” around some of its pay products in Asia. Besides, the launch will arrive in partnership with one of the “biggest names in the traditional finance industry.” However, he declined to name the company that Bitget would partner with. “You can expect that in the next six to eight weeks. I cannot wait. I am super excited,” he said. He stressed that Bitget will make crypto accessible to everyone, even the underbanked. Further, the platform lets users earn on their stablecoins. “When we talk about earning, right now in our application, users can earn a 10% instant yield. You can watch your money grow second by second.” Bitget in Talks with Indian Regulators The crypto exchange recently had talks with the Indian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) on regulations. “Some exciting announcements coming up with that in the near future,” touts Jamie. Additionally, he talked about how Bitget is focusing on the ‘underbanked’ population. “They’ve not got options, they’ve not got the opportunity to access things like credit solutions, real-world assets, stocks and shares.” When asked about the exchange’s upcoming product or feature launches, Jamie said that the company is constantly looking out for solutions that would interest users, rather than launching “shiny products.” The post Bitget in Conversation With Cryptonews: “Stablecoins are Clearly the Future” appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|Bitget|Stablecoins,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|ASIA|USDC|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-02 04:20:55

Support reset to $0.242 after an early breakout, while late-session flows pushed DOGE into the $0.254 zone before consolidation. Traders pointed to SHIB’s parallel 6% rally — underpinned by record trillion-token turnover and exchange balances at two-year lows — as further evidence of institutional accumulation across meme-coins. News Background DOGE advanced 8.8% over the 24 hours from Oct. 1, 03:00 to Oct. 2, 02:00, climbing from $0.23 to $0.25. The move was fueled by speculation around U.S. ETF approvals and aggressive institutional positioning. SHIB also surged 6.2% in the same window, with exchange reserves dropping to multi-year lows, underscoring a reduction in available supply as meme-coins gained broader bid interest. Price Action Summary DOGE traded a $0.02 corridor, marking 9.3% volatility. Breakout at 08:00 drove price from $0.234 to $0.242 on 1.03B tokens — 4x the average. Intraday highs stretched to $0.249 and $0.253 before sellers capped at $0.254. Final hour saw DOGE climb from $0.248 to $0.254 on back-to-back 40M+ surges, settling near $0.252. Technical Analysis Support has shifted to $0.242 following the breakout, with resistance hardened at $0.254–$0.255. The session carved an ascending triangle, validated by higher lows and sustained turnover. Technical desks noted Golden Cross signals across majors, reinforcing bullish momentum. Analysts flagged a decisive break above $0.255 as opening a path toward $0.32 — with ETF-driven flows providing the catalyst. What Traders Are Watching? Whether DOGE can flip $0.25 into firm support and push toward $0.32. If ETF speculation continues to underpin both DOGE and SHIB into October deadlines.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency gained 4% in the past 24 hours, climbing as high as $118,856. The market-wide upswing pushed total crypto capitalization up 4.6% to $4.17 trillion. Ether jumped 6.1% to $4,385, while XRP rose 5.6% to $2.97. This early momentum reinforced the belief among traders that October often brings strength to digital assets, with Uptober becoming a familiar rallying cry each year. Shutdown Uncertainty Fuels Investor Shift Toward Digital Assets The sharp rebound came after a week of heavy liquidations and selling pressure that had dragged prices lower. Analysts pointed to whale accumulation at the start of the week as a key driver of the reversal. Earlier this week, the US entered its first government shutdown in six years after lawmakers failed to pass a stopgap funding bill. The shutdown, which began at midnight on Wednesday, put about 800,000 federal employees on furlough and is expected to delay key economic data releases, including jobs reports. The first US government shutdown in six years has begun, threatening wide disruption and raising doubts over the timing of spot altcoin ETF approvals. #Shutdown #cryptoETF https://t.co/PMqC3aeGqd — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 1, 2025 Rather than dampening sentiment, the uncertainty gave Bitcoin fresh appeal as a hedge against government dysfunction. “Markets hate uncertainty, so expect volatility to increase,” said Lucas Kiely, CEO of digital asset wealth manager Future Digital. He added that unless Washington resolves the impasse swiftly, the administration could use the crisis to push for cuts in the federal workforce, although he expected the Senate to block such measures and for a deal to arrive quickly. Limited Agency Response Narrows Liquidity Windows Investor flows into Bitcoin demonstrate its resilience during periods of political gridlock. Traders often view decentralized assets as an alternative when traditional markets falter, and the shutdown strengthened that perception. Still, experts warned that a protracted funding deadlock could weigh on longer-term adoption. Delays in regulatory decisions, particularly around spot altcoin exchange-traded funds, would test investor patience. “If the SEC or CFTC cannot respond, you get higher legal risk assumptions, slower integration deals and narrower liquidity windows,” said Hedy Wang, CEO and co-founder of Block Street. Wang explained that staffing shortages could slow supervisory work, inter-agency coordination and even comparability reviews with states. That would mean new issuers wait longer for approvals and banks hesitate to move from pilot projects to production. “Practically, that’s a near-term adoption drag even if the long-term framework remains solid,” she added. Macroeconomic Pressures Provide Extra Lift To Cryptocurrencies Despite those concerns, traders seized on Thursday’s rally as proof of Bitcoin’s staying power. The narrative around Uptober, built over years of October gains, added further fuel to the momentum. The rally also reflected broader macroeconomic dynamics. A weakening dollar, pressured by ongoing political turmoil and investor risk rotation, gave cryptocurrencies extra lift. With global markets bracing for volatility, digital assets drew strength from their role as an alternative investment.

On its first day of operations, Bullish began spot trading with two institutional clients: the digital asset brokerage Nonco and the digital asset trust and security firm BitGo, according to reports from October 1. The platform is now accessible in major US markets, including California, Florida, Arizona, Washington, D.C., and New York. Bullish expands its operation in 20 US states amid Trump’s crypto stance In New York, digital asset providers are required to obtain a BitLicense to transfer, hold, or issue virtual currency successfully. This license is recognized as one of the most challenging to obtain. Concerning Bullish’s launch, several analysts have noted that this process aligns with the Trump administration’s strong push for crypto regulation , which aims to encourage institutional adoption of cryptocurrency in the country. Major crypto players, such as Binance and Coinbase, as well as the online payment service Stripe, have begun providing crypto-as-a-service and stablecoin options for their US-based institutional clients to meet this demand. Meanwhile, although it lacks a presence in the largest market to date, Bullish has handled around $1.5 trillion in trading volume worldwide since its launch in late 2021. Additionally, the platform claims to have secured a position among the top 10 crypto exchanges in terms of Bitcoin and Ether trading volume. The President of Bullish Exchange, Chris Tyrer, further noted that the platform employs a central limit order book strategy, combined with a fixed automated market maker. With this combination, Bullish can offer deep, stable liquidity and efficient trade execution. The platform aims to expand its presence by attracting more institutional participants, including hedge funds, proprietary trading companies, market makers, fintech firms, and neobanks. Bullish has adopted an enticing deal to appeal to these institutional participants, such as offering 0% maker fees for institutional accounts and 0% trading fees for advanced individual traders. This is only available in the 20 US states approved, as Bullish looks to expand soon. In a statement, a spokesperson for the platform stated that Bullish was intended for institutions that express their commitment to providing the same top-notch performance to serious traders throughout the US. Eric Adams refers to the BitLicensing regime as a barrier to innovation in the country New York City Mayor Eric Adams earlier criticized his state’s BitLicensing regime, claiming that it acted as a barrier to innovation and slowed down economic growth. During a closing keynote interview at the London Crypto and Digital Assets Summit, Adams recommended that his state’s legislative counterparts in Albany hear from those in the industry. “It is about thinking not only outside the box, but on this one, we may have to destroy the box,” he said. Adams is a vocal crypto supporter who ran for mayor, promising to transform New York City into a center of the cryptocurrency industry and accepting his first three paychecks in Bitcoin. During an interview, he described cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology as the next chapters in the future, urging that the opportunity should not be wasted. New York State is the most stringent in requiring a license for crypto firms. According to New York City’s mayor, this is a high barrier, and it simply makes them less competitive, yet they need to remain competitive.

Some analysts have suggested that the cryptocurrency is ready to challenge the recent highs and enter a new price discovery phase. Related Reading: BNB Eyes New Highs As Price Reclaims $1,000 – Is A 30% Rally Coming? Solana Starts ‘Uptober’ In The Green After the recent market correction, Solana has started the new quarter with a 7.3% bounce from yesterday’s lows. Last week, the cryptocurrency fell from its recent highs and hit a local low of $190 after closing below the $200 support for the first time in nearly a month. Over the weekend, the altcoin reclaimed the crucial barrier and attempted to turn the $205-$210 area into support during the last two days of September. After closing the month around the $208 level, SOL’s price bounced 5.3% on Wednesday morning toward the $220 mark. Some market watchers previously noted that $218 level was the most important level for the cryptocurrency’s recovery, as the largest supply wall exists around this level. This level coincides with Solana’s $120-$220 macro range high. Analyst Crypto Jelle considers that SOL “is ready for its second expansion wave for the cycle” after months of re-accumulation, the September rally, and the successful retest of the breakout level. Amid today’s pump, the analyst affirmed that the cryptocurrency has “one last hurdle to overcome” before the rally to new highs begins. Per the post, once Solana turns the $250 level into support, the altcoins will be “in for a great end of the year.” Similarly, Altcoin Sherpa suggested that SOL will likely rally toward the $230-$235 area and above if Bitcoin (BTC) and the crypto market remain stable. Corporate Momentum, ETFs To Fuel Q4 Rally Solana’s momentum has been partially driven by growing corporate interest in the cryptocurrency, with SOL-focused Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) pouring billions of dollars into the strategies over the past few months. On October 1, Nasdaq-listed VisionSys AI Inc. announced a $2 billion SOL-based treasury strategy in partnership with Marinade Finance, Solana’s leading staking protocol. The initiative aims to “strengthen VisionSys’s balance sheet, enhance liquidity, and create long-term shareholder value through the strategic acquisition and staking of Solana (SOL),” the announcement reads. Marinade Finance will serve as VisionSys’s exclusive staking and ecosystem partner, and the program’s first phase is set to acquire and stake $500 million in SOL within the next six months. Additionally, the pending approval of multiple crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has raised expectations for an October rally. In August and September, the regulatory agency pushed its final decision deadline for multiple crypto investment products, including SOL-based ETFs, between mid-October and mid-November. Related Reading: Ethereum Ready For Round 2? Analyst Forecasts Early October Rally Amid $4,200 Retest On Monday, Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas affirmed that “the odds are really 100% now.” “Generic listing standards make the 19b-4s and their ‘clock’ meaningless,” he explained, adding, “That just leaves the S-1s waiting for formal green light from Corp Finance. And they just submitted amendment #4 for Solana. The baby could come any day. Be ready.” As of this writing, Solana is trading at $219, a 11.1% increase in the monthly timeframe.

Quintenz’s CFTC Chair Nomination Withdrawn On Tuesday, Politico reported that the White House had pulled Brian Quintez’s nomination for CFTC chairman following opposition from major crypto industry players, according to two anonymous sources who spoke with the news media outlet. According to the report, a White House official confirmed that Quintenz’s nomination was withdrawn, affirming that “Brian Quintenz remains a trusted ally and the Trump administration looks forward to working with him in other capacities.” “President Trump has made it a priority to make America the crypto capital of the world, and in doing so has called for the revitalization of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to play a larger role in securing this promise,” the official added. Notably, President Trump’s CFTC chair pick had been in confirmation limbo since July, after the US Senate Agriculture Committee delayed a crucial vote to advance the process days before the August recess. At the time, reports claimed that the committee stalled Quintenz’s confirmation process following a request from the White House. The delay reportedly followed opposition from Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Gemini co-founders, who allegedly pressed President Trump to reconsider his CFTC chair pick, arguing that he wouldn’t “shake up” the Commission enough and was not aligned with Trump’s crypto agenda. Last month, Quintenz seemingly confirmed the reports, suggesting that the Winklevoss twins might have “misled” the US President after a text exchange between the three. As reported by Bitcoinist, the crypto exchange founders inquired about the then-CFTC nominee’s opinion on a complaint letter, but were ultimately disappointed and surprised by his response. In a message to Politico, Quintenz stated, “Being nominated to chair the CFTC and going through the confirmation process was the honor of my life.” “I am grateful to the President for that opportunity and to the Senate Agriculture Committee for its consideration,” he affirmed, adding that he looks forward to returning to the private sector. CFTC’s Pro-Crypto Leadership To Be Determined Despite Quintenz’s widespread support from both the crypto and traditional financial industries, his nomination was not only opposed by the Winklevoss twins. The traditional gaming industry has also opposed the former CFTC chair candidate due to his ties to the up-and-coming prediction market firm Kalshi, the report noted. Additionally, Democratic House of Representatives member Dina Titus reacted to the news on X, writing, “Good. The CFTC deserves strong, independent leadership that will follow and enforce agency regulations.” The White House official said a new candidate would be announced “in the near future.” Two weeks ago, Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration was weighing additional nominees to chair the CFTC amid the delay in Quintenz’s confirmation process. Among the contenders, the White House was reportedly considering Michael Selig, chief counsel to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Crypto Task Force, and Tyler Williams, counselor to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on digital asset policy. Politico sources claimed that Josh Sterling, a former CFTC official who is now a partner at Milbank, and former CFTC Commissioner Jill Sommers, are also being considered to lead the regulatory agency. It’s worth noting that the highly anticipated market structure is expected to shift most of the crypto market supervision to the CFTC, exponentially increasing the regulator’s responsibilities. Currently, the agency, which is intended to be a five-person, bipartisan commission, is down to only acting Chairwoman Caroline Pham, who is expected to depart from the agency once a permanent leader is selected. Multiple industry players have emphasized that installing a permanent Chairman is “absolutely critical” to realizing the Commission’s goals and to ensure a “golden age of crypto innovation.”",Crypto News|bitcoin|Brian Quintenz|btc|BTCUSDT|cameron and tyler winklevoss|Caroline D.

Investors are now hopeful for another push toward the $5,000 level and beyond in the coming weeks. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart ETH has successfully defended the $4,000 support zone, bouncing from the area. This zone overlaps with the 100-day moving average and a previous demand block, making it a technically significant level. The RSI has also recovered from the oversold region and now sits at 50, suggesting momentum is shifting back toward the bulls. The asset is currently pushing toward the $4,800 resistance level and the midline of the large ascending channel. A breakout from this area would open the doors for a historical ETH rally in the coming months. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4H chart, ETH has printed a textbook head and shoulders recovery. After bouncing from the support zone near $3,850, it reclaimed the $4,100 level and formed a higher low. It is now approaching the $4,400–$4,500 supply zone, which initiated last week’s decline. Overall, the short-term structure is now bullish. If ETH breaks above the $4,500 level, the next target could be the $4,800 high. However, a rejection from here could lead to a short consolidation phase before continuation. Sentiment Analysis Funding Rates Ethereum funding rates have recently bounced back into positive territory after briefly turning negative during the latest price drop. This negative dip showed that short sellers had taken control, pushing funding rates below zero as the market leaned heavily bearish. But the quick recovery suggests those shorts were either closed or liquidated, and traders are slowly regaining confidence. The return to positive funding indicates a growing appetite for long positions, although that interest still looks cautious for now. Compared to previous cycles, the current funding remains well below euphoric levels. There’s no sign of excessive leverage or overcrowded longs, which is generally a healthy sign. When funding resets like this without spiking too quickly, it often reflects a more stable trading environment. If this steady climb in funding continues, it could support a more sustained price recovery rather than a short-lived pump.

Ripple CTO quitting refers to David Schwartz stepping down from daily CTO responsibilities to join Ripple’s Board and to serve as an adviser. He cited a desire for more family time and continued focus on side projects and XRPL experimentation while remaining involved at the company level. How did XRP react? XRP initially slipped about 1.2% on the day of the announcement but recovered with a roughly 4% rally the following session. Short-term volatility followed the update, with price action influenced by broader market moves including Bitcoin’s spike tied to U.S. government news. Context: Schwartz has been with Ripple for more than 13 years and is a founding contributor to the XRP Ledger. He confirmed he will keep experimenting with XRPL nodes and novel use cases while shifting responsibilities. “The last few months I’ve been tinkering on the side – spinning up my own XRPL node and publishing its output data, researching other use cases for XRP (besides what Ripple is focused on), and more,” Schwartz said in his statement. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse praised Schwartz’s impact on the community, calling his work “legend.” Source: X What is the wider market context for this leadership change? Alongside the leadership update, Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD expanded by nearly $50 million after recent institutional attention and partnerships. RLUSD’s market cap is approaching $800 million , signaling adoption growth since its launch last December. RLUSD also expanded into African markets via local stablecoin payment providers, supporting increased on-ramps for fiat-to-stablecoin transfers in the region. Will RLUSD expansion support XRP recovery? RLUSD growth could indirectly support XRP by strengthening Ripple’s payments ecosystem, but direct causation is not established. Market participants noted XRP consolidated for three months and may either break out or capitulate in the short run based on macro catalysts and liquidity flows. On-chain and derivatives metrics also showed elevated bullish positioning. Binance top-trader data indicated long positions increased by roughly 3 percentage points (from 67% to 70%) over three days—an indicator of trader sentiment, not a guaranteed price outcome. Source: XRP/USDT, TradingView Source: Coinglass Frequently Asked Questions Will David Schwartz leave Ripple entirely? No. He is stepping back from the CTO role but will join Ripple’s Board of Directors and act as an adviser while continuing XRPL-focused side projects and research. How did markets react to the announcement?

Ripple’s chief technology officer (CTO), David Schwartz, has announced his departure from the top role after 13 years of service. According to Schwartz’s tweet , he will retire from the day-to-day duties as Ripple CTO by the end of the year. This doesn’t mean that the crypto veteran will completely exit the XRP community; he says he will continue to work from the sidelines while returning to his hobbies. Ripple CTO Resigns After 13 Years Schwartz described his time at Ripple and his life’s journey so far as a wild ride. He went from consulting for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) to learning about Bitcoin in its early stages. Over a decade ago, he met three people with whom he collaborated on coding the XRP Ledger (XRPL). “I can’t begin to explain the depth of my gratitude to this company, the people who work here, and the community that surrounds XRPL. It’s been one of the greatest honors and experiences of my life, second only to my amazing family,” Schwartz stated. During his last months as CTO, the Ripple executive managed an XRPL node and published its output data. He has also been in search of other use cases for XRP, besides the areas Ripple has focused on. Schwartz revealed that he has enjoyed getting his hands dirty, coding for the love of it, and interacting with builders. His decision to resign will enable him to return to these hobbies while spending time with his family. Could This Change Affect XRP? As the Emeritus CTO, Schwartz says he will still be in and out of the office. Ripple Labs co-founder Chris Larsen asked Schwartz to join the company’s Board of Directors, and he accepted. This will enable the OG to continue supporting the firm’s mission and long-term vision. It goes without saying that Schwartz has been a crucial player in the XRP ecosystem. His departure from a more hands-on position could mean a lot for the XRPL. While Ripple is yet to unveil its new CTO, Schwartz’s successor could apply new and different strategies that could make or mar the growth of the XRP ecosystem. If the former becomes the case, then such positive development could propel the price of XRP to new highs. Either way, Schwartz’s departure is likely to have a significant impact on XRP and the XRPL. It remains to be seen if it will be positive or negative.

Answering questions from Katie Greifeld, Eric Balchunas, and Scarlet Fu, Wood painted an optimistic picture for the markets, particularly defending Bitcoin's superiority over gold. The most resonant part of Wood’s speech was his statement of faith in Bitcoin: “Bitcoin is undoubtedly better than gold.” Related News: A Major Exchange Announced It Has Increased Its Investment in a Surprise Altcoin Wood noted that investors are currently implementing a “barbell strategy” involving stocks (in anticipation of low interest rates and economic recovery) and gold/crypto assets (as a hedge), adding that cryptocurrencies have performed well over time despite being more volatile. Wood noted that ARK Invest has “very good exposure” to the cryptocurrency cycle, arguing that stablecoins (Tether and Circle, 90% of the market) provide a significant gateway to the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. He also explained why his funds favor Digital Asset Trusts (DATs) like Bitmine and Soulmate over Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The primary reason, Wood explained, is that generating returns through staking is a crucial part of the Ethereum story, something ETFs currently don't allow. He noted that this strategy gives ARK exposure to the “big three” of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. *This is not investment advice.

With Friday’s U.S. payrolls report potentially delayed and Japanese yields climbing to their highest levels since 2008, crypto markets are showing signs of decoupling from broader macro caution. The setup has fueled expectations that policymakers may eventually be forced to ease financial conditions, creating a friendlier backdrop for risk-taking. “The U.S. government shutdown and weak employment numbers from ADP have impacted markets this past week. Traders believe that these catalysts could be making a case for the Fed to further stimulate the economy and cut rates through the rest of the year, which could boost stocks and cryptocurrencies,” said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, in a Telegram note to CoinDesk. Shutdowns that delay data and weaken fiscal visibility often encourage central banks to act more cautiously, while rising yields in Japan hint at policy shifts that could ripple through global funding markets. For crypto, these dynamics translate into speculation over fresh inflows and renewed appetite for volatility. Bitcoin traded near $118,700, gaining more than 3% in the past 24 hours, while ether rose 5.6% to $4,374. Solana added nearly 7% to reach $223, and dogecoin surged almost 9% to $0.25, extending its outperformance among majors. XRP steadied at $2.97 after volatile swings around the $3.00 level earlier this week. The broad rally lifted the market capitalization of all digital assets to over $2.37 trillion, per CoinMarketCap data. Meanwhile, volatility metrics also reinforce the picture of steadier markets. “The major theme this quarter is with lower implied volatilities, evident across equities, rates, FX, and even BTC. This has been driven by a collapse in realized volatilities thanks to an accommodative Fed, stabilizing global GDP, lack of significant tariff-passthroughs on CPI readings, and a flattening of geopolitics and tariff surprises,” said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus, said in an email. With bitcoin consolidating just under $119,000 and dogecoin pushing higher, the coming weeks may show whether flows can sustain momentum or whether renewed pressure from Washington and Tokyo will test crypto’s bid for decoupling.",Markets|Trading|Bitcoin|Markets|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|BTC|ASIA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-02 05:09:40

Vanguard is considering allowing client access to Bitcoin ETFs or potentially developing crypto-related offerings. The firm is evaluating whether to permit third‑party Bitcoin ETF purchases via its platform rather than launching an in‑house ETF, balancing investor demand with custody and regulatory concerns. How are competitors performing in the Bitcoin ETF market? Competitors have driven sizable inflows: industry figures indicate about $57.73 billion in cumulative inflows to Bitcoin ETFs since launch, with top funds commanding large shares of assets under management. This performance is prompting established asset managers to reassess market participation. Why might Vanguard change its stance on crypto investments? Under CEO Salim Ramji, Vanguard may soften prior restrictions to avoid losing assets as clients seek crypto exposure. Ramji’s prior involvement with Bitcoin ETF launches at other firms suggests institutional experience that could shape a measured approach to offering crypto access. What operational and regulatory factors is Vanguard evaluating? Vanguard is reviewing custody solutions, third‑party provider diligence, client suitability procedures, and regulatory compliance. These operational details determine whether to route client trades to external Bitcoin ETFs or build internal capabilities while minimizing fiduciary and compliance risks. When could Vanguard announce a decision? Vanguard has not provided a timeline. The firm is in an exploratory phase and will likely announce changes only after completing due diligence and regulatory reviews to ensure client protections and operational readiness. Frequently Asked Questions Will Vanguard let existing customers buy Bitcoin ETFs through its platform? Vanguard has indicated it is evaluating that option; no formal rollout has been announced. If approved, access could be limited initially to third‑party Bitcoin ETFs subject to due diligence. How much have Bitcoin ETFs attracted in assets? Industry estimates show roughly $57.73 billion in cumulative inflows to Bitcoin ETFs since launch, with leading funds capturing significant shares of overall AUM. Key Takeaways Demand-driven review : Vanguard is reassessing its crypto stance due to strong investor interest in Bitcoin ETFs. Third‑party access likely : The firm appears more inclined to enable client access to external Bitcoin ETFs than to immediately launch a proprietary product. Risk and diligence focus : Custody, compliance and volatility remain central to Vanguard’s decision-making process; investors should monitor formal announcements. Conclusion Vanguard’s evaluation of Bitcoin ETF access reflects growing investor demand and competitive pressure from firms that have captured substantial ETF inflows. While the firm explores operational and regulatory solutions under CEO Salim Ramji, no official product launch has been announced. Investors should track Vanguard’s formal statements and consider risk tolerance before seeking crypto exposure. Vanguard is considering offering Bitcoin ETFs as demand for crypto-backed investments grows, with competitors like BlackRock leading the market. Vanguard is exploring offering Bitcoin ETFs in response to growing demand and competitors like BlackRock accumulating $142 billion in AUM. Under CEO Salim Ramji, Vanguard might soften its stance on crypto and allow clients to access third-party Bitcoin ETFs. Despite positive market trends, analysts warn that embracing crypto investments could be risky if the market sees a sharp decline. Vanguard, one of the largest asset management firms globally, is reportedly considering the addition of crypto-related products, particularly Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), to its investment offerings. This potential move comes at a time when demand for Bitcoin ETFs continues to surge. As competition heats up, Vanguard is looking into whether it should join the ranks of firms that have seen strong ETF adoption. The Bitcoin ETF market has proven highly profitable for its key players. Industry reporting shows that leading ETFs have attracted substantial inflows, prompting asset managers to reassess product strategies. As of early 2024, Bitcoin ETFs collectively recorded major inflows, underscoring investor appetite for regulated, ETF‑based crypto exposure. Isabelle Lee, a financial analyst, noted the importance of not overlooking the growing demand for Bitcoin ETFs. She emphasized that Vanguard would risk losing assets if it fails to act, particularly as competitors capture substantial market share. Bloomberg is cited as having reported on these market dynamics in industry coverage. Vanguard Shifting Its Stance on Crypto Investments Previously, Vanguard kept many clients from direct crypto exposure. Under CEO Salim Ramji, who joined leadership recently, there are clear signs Vanguard may permit more client choice on crypto access. Insiders indicate the firm favors a careful, compliance‑first approach. Rather than launching its own Bitcoin ETF immediately, Vanguard appears to be prioritizing the option to offer clients access to third‑party Bitcoin ETFs. This approach would enable client exposure without Vanguard directly managing crypto assets, while preserving oversight and due diligence controls. Uncertainty Amid Potential Adoption No official Vanguard announcement has been issued. Analysts caution that expanding crypto access carries risks if the Bitcoin market reverses sharply. Vanguard’s ultimate decision will weigh investor demand against fiduciary duty and operational readiness. The firm’s next steps will be watched closely by investors and industry observers. Any future change in Vanguard’s platform policies could meaningfully affect flows into Bitcoin ETFs and broader crypto investment accessibility.",News|BTC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-02 05:13:03

(October 2),https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/02/why-is-the-crypto-market-going-up-and-the-uptober-rally-happening-october-2/,"The crypto market is going up today, October 2, with Bitcoin price surging to $119,000. Ethereum price soared to $4,375, XRP to $2.965, and Binance Coin (BNB) to $1,035. The market capitalization of all coins jumped to $4.07 trillion. ZCash (ZEC) price soared by 57%, bringing its valuation to over $2 billion. DeXe price was up by 23%, while SPX6900, Pudgy Penguins, Sonic, nd Aerodrome Finance rose by over 10% in the last 24 hours. Crypto market rallies as Fed rate cuts odds jump The first reason why the crypto market is going up today is that the odds that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the coming meeting. These odds jumped after ADP published weak jobs numbers on Wednesday. The report showed that the economy lost over 36,000 jobs in September after losing another 3,000 in August. The most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) report showed that the economy created just 22,000 jobs in August. A revision also showed that it lost jobs in June. Another report this week showed that US hiring slowed in August . The BLS is scheduled to release the September jobs numbers on Friday this week. However, it is unclear whether it will do that as the government has shut down. Still, economists expect the report to show that the economy created 39,000 jobs in September. A Federal Reserve interest rate cut favors the crypto market because these coins are risky assets. In the past, these assets do well when the bank was either cutting rates or when it had a dovish outlook. Crypto prices are jumping as the ETF approval season nears The other main reason why the crypto market is jumping is that the altcoin ETF approval season has arrived. Fund managers have filed for over 70 ETF applications in the past few months, with the deadline for most of them being this month. Litecoin will go first as the final deadline for the Grayscale Litecoin Trust is today. Coins like XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, and Hedera Hashgraph come later this month. Altcoin ETF approvals will be highly bullish for the crypto industry, and it will inject more institutional funds. A good example of this is Ethereum ETFs, which have brought in over $12 billion in inflows since their inception. Bitcoin ETFs have had over $58 billion in inflows. More data shows that there is robust demand for altcoin ETFs as top coins like Solana , XRP, and Dogecoin have had substantial inflows this year. Bitcoin price has formed a bullish flag pattern The other notable reason why the crypto market is going up today is that Bitcoin price has formed a bullish flag chart pattern, pointing to a robust Uptober rally this year. The daily timeframe chart shows that the coin has formed a bullish flag pattern, which is made up of a descending channel and a vertical line, which resembles a hoisted flag. In most cases, this flag normally leads to a strong bullish breakout. Bitcoin price has also remained above the 50-day moving average and the Ichimoku cloud indicator. It has also moved to the strong pivot reverse point at $118,750, pointing to more upside towards the extreme overshoot level at $131,250. A Bitcoin price surge normally leads to more gains in the crypto market as the coin usually sets the tone. BTC price chart | Source: TradingView Historical perspective is boosting to cryptocurrency market rally The other reason why the crypto market is going up is that history shows that October and the fourth quarter of the year are the most bullish for the crypto market. Bitcoin has an average return of 80% in the fourth quarter since 2013. Its monthly return in October is 20%. Most notably, since 2013, the coin only dropped in 2018 and 2014. It jumped by 10% last year and 28% a year earlier. Therefore, the ongoing crypto market rally is because investors anticipate that the trend will happen again this year.

At Token2049 in Singapore, he explained that delays in Ethereum’s system make it harder for issuers to return assets quickly, while Solana offers more flexibility. The conversation happened as the SEC is in the process of reviewing multiple Solana and Ethereum ETF applications, though decisions could be delayed by the ongoing US government shutdown. Solana May Gain Edge Over Ethereum Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley believes Solana could gain an advantage over Ethereum in the race to launch staking exchange-traded funds (ETFs), due to the fact that its design is more favorable for investors. At Token2049 in Singapore, Horsley explained that Solana’s quicker unstaking process gives it an edge, particularly when compared to Ethereum’s growing withdrawal queues. He said that issuers must be able to return assets to investors quickly, and delays in Ethereum’s system pose a big challenge. Staking requires users to lock up tokens to secure a network in exchange for rewards, but withdrawals can take time depending on network demand. Ethereum-based products have tried to address this by using credit facilities to maintain redemption liquidity or by relying on liquid staking tokens like Lido’s stETH. However, Horsley appointed ut that credit facilities add costs and face capacity limits, while liquid staking alternatives come with their own complexities. Ethereum’s staking system recently saw mounting congestion. Earlier in September, its staking entry queue surged to 860,369 ETH, which is the highest level since 2023. Now, the entry queue is still close to 200,000 ETH, with wait times averaging around three days, while the exit queue stretches to roughly 34 days with more than 2 million tokens awaiting withdrawal. In contrast, Solana’s queues typically clear faster, which creates a much more flexible environment for ETF issuers. Ethereum validator queue (Source: Validatorqueue.com ) The timing of Horsley’s comments coincides with certain key regulatory decisions. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to rule on several Solana and Ethereum ETF applications this month, including those with staking provisions. Bitwise, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, CoinShares, Grayscale, Canary Capital, and VanEck are all among the firms that filed updated applications for Solana ETFs. Meanwhile, decisions on Ethereum staking ETFs, including BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, were postponed until late October. In total, 16 crypto-related funds are currently awaiting SEC approval. However, progress could be delayed even more due to the ongoing US government shutdown that left federal agencies operating with limited staff.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|SOL|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-02 05:30:00

A central concern is how multiple digital assets, including Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) , can function in a cross-border environment. The text explains how trust networks and gateways allow direct transactions when parties hold access to both sets of coins. The paper states that in the traditional banking world, users depend on bilateral relationships with banks. In contrast, the digital model allows individuals to establish trust with multiple issuers. It argues that this multiownership model applies domestically and internationally. The discussion of a framework for a “global marketplace for digital money” is illustrated in the document. The inclusion indicates acknowledgment of XRP within the scope of digital assets that could operate in such a system. The IMF has previously highlighted XRP’s role , and while it does not endorse individual assets, its reference is notable because few specific cryptocurrencies are mentioned by name in such documents. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Perspective on XRP’s Role For KingValex and others who closely follow XRP, this kind of detail carries weight. He stated that “nobody makes a big deal about that in the crypto media,” suggesting a deliberate effort to minimize its visibility. He believes that XRP’s role in cross-border solutions remains underappreciated, even when mentioned in authoritative global finance material. The IMF’s notes highlight that cross-border challenges are not only about technical compatibility but also about trust and regulatory frameworks. The text describes how spending foreign-issued digital coins locally can be difficult without an efficient marketplace. A marketplace model where users exchange one digital asset for another could address this, and XRP’s established history as a bridge currency and cross-border settlement asset explains why observers notice its mention.

Historically, Q4 has been Bitcoin’s strongest quarter by far, with a median return of 47%, and this growth typically helps lift the broader market. Because altcoins have lower valuations, fundamentally strong ones with supportive communities often outperform Bitcoin during periods of market expansion. Currently, analysts are backing three projects as potentially being the best crypto to buy: Dogecoin, Hyperliquid, and PEPENODE . Dogecoin and Hyperliquid are expected to benefit from the increased investor risk appetite that tends to occur in Q4, as this draws more liquidity into meme coin and futures trading markets, where these projects are positioned. Meanwhile, PEPENODE is considered one of the most promising new cryptocurrencies, introducing the world’s first Mine-to-Earn meme coin that allows users to earn rewards through a virtual mining experience – without the usual headaches of crypto mining (high setup costs, expensive overheads, and technical expertise requirements. DOGE and HYPE Could Boom as Market Sentiment Rises Both Dogecoin and Hyperliquid trade in speculative markets. Dogecoin is a meme coin tied to retail enthusiasm, hype, and entertainment, while Hyperliquid is a Layer 1 blockchain focused on leveraged trading. As a result, both projects are likely to benefit as traders become less cautious and take larger, riskier positions, which is typically the case in Q4. Currently, CoinMarketCap’s Fear and Greed Index stands at 42, indicating a neutral sentiment that leans toward fear. It will move into greed at 60 and extreme greed at 80. The last time it reached extreme greed was in Q4 2024, a period characterized by immense bullishness for altcoins. Dogecoin, for example, gained over 350% from early October 2024 to its peak in December. Hyperliquid saw nearly a 400% increase during the same period. And this Q4, analysts anticipate more of the same. Bitcoinsensus is predicting a DOGE breakout to $0.48 in the coming weeks, which represents more than a 2x from its current price of $0.23. $DOGE on the Verge of Breaking Out📈💥 Classic Ascending Triangle Pattern. Measured Target : 0.48$ 🎯 pic.twitter.com/ctOrCexSKr — Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) September 30, 2025 Meanwhile, analyst Pickle pointed out that HYPE is only up 50% from its 2024 peak, despite fundamentals – such as on-chain activity – being 5x higher. He suggests that the HYPE price “will have to melt up at some stage,” hinting at the potential for substantial gains ahead. HYPE is only up 50% from it's Dec 2024 highs, whilst fundamentals are up about 5x (volume, OI). This will have a melt up at some stage. pic.twitter.com/yIaqnWH7jt — pickle (@Pickle_cRypto) September 16, 2025 That said, the gains from these multi-billion-dollar giants may pale in comparison to those provided by promising low-cap altcoins that gain significant traction as the market climbs higher. Regarding which emerging tokens could see the biggest returns, many experts are backing PEPENODE. Top Trader Says Viral Meme Coin PEPENODE Can 100x Mining is the foundation of the crypto industry, used to secure blockchains, distribute tokens fairly, and incentivize network participation. However, in recent years, retail users have been priced out of Bitcoin mining, with publicly listed companies and large, globally distributed mining pools capturing most of the rewards. PEPENODE is reversing this trend by rekindling the ‘solo miner’ era – and it’s removing the need for expensive hardware, space, noise, and costly electricity bills. All it requires is an internet connection and a cryptocurrency wallet. Before exploring what analysts are saying, here’s a quick explanation of how PEPENODE works: you start with a virtual server room, spend PEPENODE tokens to fill it with Miner Nodes and upgrade them, and then you can generate mining power. The more you produce, the more rewards you earn. It’s straightforward, strategic, and fun. Users will earn rewards in PEPENODE tokens, but there’ll also be opportunities to earn other meme coins like Pepe and Fartcoin. But the most exciting part is that 70% of PEPENODE spent in the store will be burned, creating steady deflationary pressure that could support long-term growth. This combination of meme appeal, token utility, and sticky deflationary mechanics is why analysts like Nazza Crypto are predicting 100x returns. Another factor boosting bullish sentiment is that PEPENODE is currently in a presale, drawing huge demand and hype with over $1.5 million raised so far. Conclusion: PEPENODE Could Notch the Biggest Q4 Returns Based on historical data, price charts, and fundamentals, both Dogecoin and Hyperliquid could experience substantial gains in Q4, possibly surpassing the returns of Bitcoin and many other altcoins. However, PEPENODE ’s early stage and strong use case create a unique situation that could outperform even the highest-performing large-cap cryptocurrencies. Yet, it’s worth emphasizing that the opportunity to enter PEPENODE early is dwindling, as the presale is selling out quickly, and price hikes will occur throughout the event, with the next scheduled in just two days.

Here Are the Analyst’s Detailed Opinions,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-to-expect-in-bitcoin-btc-prices-in-the-coming-days-here-are-the-analysts-detailed-opinions/,"Following the government shutdown in the US, gold and Bitcoin (BTC) are facing off again as investors seek a safe haven. Analyst Frank Cappelleri, while evaluating the current picture, stated that gold has entered the overbought region even though it exhibits a strong trend technically, while Bitcoin is preparing the ground for a new rise. Cappelleri noted that gold has made a strong breakout thanks to the “classic continuation pattern” it has displayed throughout the year, recording a historic 17.3% gain in the last two months. However, he cautioned that gold may enter a period of recession following this rise: The RSI indicator has re-established itself around 80. While this suggests that momentum is strong, it also suggests a need for a breather. While gold remains strong, analysts believe there could be short-term outflows. Cappelleri emphasized that Bitcoin is one of the assets likely to attract capital: “While gold is tiring in the short term, Bitcoin has been showing signs of recovery in recent days. Historically, Bitcoin has tended to outperform gold as it approaches its peak.” Related News: A Major Exchange Announced It Has Increased Its Investment in a Surprise Altcoin Cappelleri also highlighted Bitcoin's seasonal effects. He noted that October and November have historically been strong months for Bitcoin, adding that this period has a self-fulfilling prophecy effect on investor psychology. Gold has outperformed Bitcoin by over 20% since the beginning of the year. However, according to the analyst, this gap could close: “If the recent Bitcoin recovery is the start of a new strong rally like the one in April, BTC could catch up with gold or give back some of its gains.” As a result, Cappelleri stated that investors are reconsidering their search for safe havens due to the government shutdown, and that a capital rotation from gold to Bitcoin may gain momentum in this environment. *This is not investment advice.

Prediction market operator Polymarket is preparing to relaunch its platform in the United States after nearly four years of restrictions, with regulatory filings showing that trading could begin as early as Thursday. The world’s largest prediction market announced its plans to reenter the American market after acquiring QCX LLC, later renamed Polymarket US, for $112 million. The acquisition gave Polymarket a Designated Contract Market (DCM) license in July. It can now self-certify markets for US users, including sports and political events. Polymarket could launch 5 days early According to the initial regulatory filings seen by Cryptopolitan, October 7 was slated as the prediction market’s earliest possible launch date. Revised filings submitted Wednesday with the CFTC have reportedly brought the date forward to October 2. Polymarket DCM license filing. Source: CFTC Visitors to the company’s website are being invited to join a waiting list ahead of the launch. A message on the homepage states that Americans will be notified by text message when the platform is ready for registration. “Polymarket will soon be available for US traders. We’re working hard to get the US platform ready for launch,” the message reads. Polymarket’s return required months of negotiation with US regulators, even after it purchased QCX. The firm awaited a no-action letter from the CFTC that would prevent enforcement over alleged violations of swap data reporting and recordkeeping rules. That letter arrived during the first week of September, when Chief Executive Shayne Coplan said it was a “green light to go live in the USA,” Cryptopolitan reported . Polymarket has been given the green light to go live in the USA by the @CFTC . Credit to the Commission and Staff for their impressive work. This process has been accomplished in record timing. Stay tuned https://t.co/NVziTixpqO — Shayne Coplan 🦅 (@shayne_coplan) September 3, 2025 The company had ceased business in the United States in January 2022 after agreeing to block local users and paying a $1.4 million civil penalty for operating as an unregistered exchange and offering bets on illegal events. The settlement kept the platform running overseas but effectively banned Americans from trading on it. Market rivalry with competitor Kalshi Polymarket returns to a competitive environment where federally regulated Kalshi is on the highest ranks in the US prediction market space. According to data from Polymarket Analytics, a service not affiliated with the platform, Polymarket has recorded $877 million in trading volume, compared with Kalshi’s $291 million. Back towards the end of August, the betting company announced Donald Trump Jr. had joined the company as an adviser ahead of its planned US relaunch. As reported by Politico, the eldest son of President Donald Trump sits on Polymarket’s advisory board, while his venture capital firm, 1789 Capital, takes a stake in the company; however, the size of the investment was not disclosed. Trump Jr. is a partner at 1789 Capital, which was founded by financier Omeed Malik. Prediction markets wager on US politics Polymarket’s US relaunch comes against the backdrop of a federal government shutdown this week after lawmakers failed to reach a budget agreement. Traders are speculating on how long the shutdown might last. On Kalshi, contracts imply that the government will be closed for about 11 days. However, Polymarket traders are more bearish, with the highest volume contracts betting on a 35% probability the shutdown will extend beyond October 15. 8% of participants expect lawmakers to reach a deal this week between October 3 and October 5. Contracts predicting a resolution between October 6 and October 9 are trading at 28% odds, while October 10 to 14 is close at 29%. The impasse is from a dispute between Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, and liberal senators, whose support is still required to pass spending legislation.

Initial capital raise expected to fund approximately $460 million in treasury assets; AVAX spiked to $31.32 intraday after the announcement. Avalanche Treasury Co. aims to buy $1B+ AVAX via SPAC merger and list as AVAT on Nasdaq in Q1 2026. Read details on strategy, advisers, and treasury structure. Avalanche Treasury Co. will launch through a blank-check merger next year, with the goal of buying over $1 billion worth of AVAX tokens. Avalanche Treasury Co. announced plans to merge with the special purpose acquisition company Mountain Lake Acquisition Corp. in a deal valuing the combined firm at more than $675 million. The announcement triggered a price move in AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche blockchain. The price of AVAX rose after the news, reaching an intraday high of $31.32 before easing; the token remains higher on the day. The merged company expects to list on the Nasdaq in the first quarter of 2026 under the ticker symbol AVAT , subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. Emin Gün Sirer, founder and CEO of Ava Labs, will join Avalanche Treasury Co. as an adviser. The firm joins a growing group of treasury-focused public companies and SPACs that target digital-asset holdings as a core asset strategy. What is Avalanche Treasury Co. planning? Avalanche Treasury Co. plans to acquire over $1 billion of AVAX tokens and become a publicly listed treasury company that is active on the Avalanche blockchain. The company expects its initial capital raise to fund roughly $460 million in treasury assets and will pursue additional on-chain revenue streams. How will the SPAC deal work? The company is merging with Mountain Lake Acquisition Corp. in a transaction valuing the combined business at over $675 million. After closing, the merged entity intends to list on Nasdaq as AVAT in Q1 2026, contingent on standard regulatory and shareholder approvals. What advisers and backers support the deal?

Planned activities include targeted protocol investments, tokenization initiatives for real-world assets and stablecoins, and building validator infrastructure to support network operations. Bart Smith stated the firm aims to offer institutional access with yield and ecosystem integration beyond simple token exposure. The company also secured an exclusive relationship with the Avalanche Foundation for prioritized token sales to U.S. digital asset treasury companies. Source: Avalanche Treasury Co. Why does this matter for AVAX and investors? Large treasury purchases can reduce circulating supply and provide a predictable buyer in secondary markets, which may support price stability. The announcement coincided with a short-term AVAX price uplift, per market reporting from CoinGecko and industry data providers (named as plain text). How is the valuation and discount structured? Avalanche Treasury Co. intends to begin with an initial AVAX purchase at a discount to market price and asserts an 18-month priority on Avalanche Foundation sales to U.S. treasury companies. The target multiple of net asset value (mNAV) is 0.77, which the company describes as a roughly 23% discount relative to buying AVAX directly. Analysts at NYDIG have cautioned that the mNAV metric can be misleading and may not fully represent corporate financial position; that critique was presented as plain text without external links.

Here’s what history suggests could happen next for BTC. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Realized Value RVT Is Approaching Cycle Lows In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has shared the latest trend in the Bitcoin Realized Value RVT of the short-term holders. The Realized Value RVT is an oscillator that measures the ratio between the sum of profits and losses being realized by BTC investors, and the total transfer volume on the network. In simple terms, what the metric tells us about is whether holders are participating in a high or low amount of profit-taking/loss-taking compared to the value being shifted around on the blockchain. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Big Move? CryptoQuant Says These Alerts Are To Watch In the context of the current topic, the version of the indicator that’s of interest is the one specifically for short-term holders (STHs), investors who purchased their Bitcoin during the past 155 days. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Value RVT for the STHs over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH Realized Value RVT has witnessed a decline recently, implying the investors have been realizing a lower amount of profit/loss compared to the volume. The metric’s recent decline has been so drastic that it has taken its value near cyclical lows. Such a trend suggests the BTC network is currently observing most of its coins moving at or near break-even. “Historically, such resets often align with periods of market detox, helping build a foundation for more durable recoveries,” explains the analytics firm. From the chart, it’s visible that the market saw similar STH Realized Value RVT values during the mid-2024 and early-2025 lows. In 2023, however, the indicator had to sink even lower before Bitcoin regained its footing. It now remains to be seen whether the latest low levels of STH Realized Value RVT mean the cryptocurrency has already bottomed, or if the metric will have to go further lower.

Another healthy development for BTC could perhaps be the reversal in its market cap dominance, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. From the chart, it’s visible that the Bitcoin dominance declined to 57% earlier, but it has since seen a rebound back to 59%. “This mean reversion suggests a healthier market structure, as BTC-led rallies have historically proven more sustainable than those driven by altcoins,” notes the analytics firm.

The bullish quarterly candle was the first decisive close above long-term resistance since 2017, fueling optimism that the asset could mirror its historic breakout pattern.

CTO Exit Sparks Mixed Signals for XRP Investors Caution has returned to the XRP community after Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, unexpectedly left. His departure has caused a split among traders: some see his final remarks as a subtle hint at XRP’s long-term potential to compete with Bitcoin, while others view it as a warning to secure profits following the token’s strong Q3 rally. Adding to the uncertainty, several early investors on X, like Crypto Bitlord , have echoed “time to sell” calls, arguing that the recent surge could trigger a bout of volatility before institutional ETF-driven inflows materialize. ETF Hopes Push Against Sell-Side Pressure One of the strongest bullish drivers remains the increasing likelihood of an XRP spot ETF approval. The SEC is reviewing multiple applications, including Grayscale’s, with decisions expected between October 18 and November 14. Prediction markets now price the approval odds at over 99%, suggesting that institutional capital could soon flood into the asset. Analysts believe that a green light could push XRP to $20–$30 by 2026, especially if inflows mirror the surges seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs earlier this year. On-chain data also supports accumulation, with exchange reserves decreasing, indicating that tokens are moving into self-custody and staking pools. Meanwhile, open interest has grown to $1.4 billion, although options activity remains thin, leaving leveraged longs vulnerable to corrections if resistance holds. Technical Picture: $2.96 Breakout or $2.70 Retest Currently, XRP trades at $2.94, holding above the 200-day SMA at $2.50 while facing resistance at the 50-day SMA ($2.96). Support is in the $2.70–$2.80 range, with deeper downside risk if sellers push toward $2.50. Momentum indicators remain neutral, with the RSI at 47, indicating room for accumulation before a significant move. If XRP closes multiple days above $2.96, analysts expect confirmation of a new rally, targeting $3.65 in the short term and $4.70 as the next major resistance. Not breaking resistance could lead October to stay in consolidation, with November being the next breakout attempt.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-next-three-months-will-be-huge-for-xrp-heres-why/,"The cryptocurrency community has been watching Ripple closely following the announcement from Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz that he will step down from daily responsibilities at the end of 2025. The change in leadership is significant, and one notable reaction came from UnknowDLT, a well-known voice in the XRP community on X, who suggested that Schwartz’s transition signals the beginning of a new chapter for the digital asset. David is stepping down as CTO. This is the most bullish thing that could have happened. David's mission is now complete, and institutions are ready to use XRP. This confirms that the next three months are going to be huge for XRP. The new financial system is here. XRP — {x} (@unknowDLT) September 30, 2025 What Does This Mean for XRP? In his post, UnknowDLT described Schwartz’s move as “the most bullish thing that could have happened.” He added that “institutions are ready to use XRP” and pointed to the next three months before he steps back as a critical period. His remarks framed Schwartz’s decision as the culmination of a stage in XRP’s development that could pave the way for broader adoption. For UnknowDLT and those who share his perspective, Schwartz’s decision to assume a CTO Emeritus role and join Ripple’s board represents a handoff at a time when XRP may be poised for broader institutional use . The belief is that Ripple has reached a level of maturity where the technology is ready to support larger-scale adoption, and that Schwartz’s long-standing work has achieved its purpose. Why the Post Matters UnknowDLT’s interpretation is noteworthy because it ties Ripple’s internal leadership shift to a wider narrative about the state of XRP in global finance. He believes that institutions are ready to use XRP , and he connects the timing of Schwartz’s transition to a broader readiness among financial entities to engage with the asset. This perspective places the CTO’s decision within a framework of progress rather than uncertainty, positioning it as validation of XRP’s role in an evolving financial landscape. Whether those expectations align with actual adoption or announcements remains to be seen, but the conviction behind the statement reflects a growing anticipation within the community. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Looking Forward Schwartz’s departure from daily responsibilities comes alongside Ripple’s confirmation that leadership of engineering functions will continue under Dennis Jarosch, the company’s Senior Vice President of Engineering. Although the official explanation emphasized personal reasons and continuity, community figures like UnknowDLT have interpreted it as a milestone event with broader market significance. As Schwartz moves into a new role and Ripple continues to expand the XRP ecosystem and its operations, the community’s focus remains fixed on whether the optimism expressed by prominent voices translates into tangible results.

Traders are flocking to little-known tokens like XYZVerse, hoping for bigger gains. The shift in focus raises questions about where smart money is heading as the market’s main player turns volatile. What’s driving this new trend in digital assets? Bitcoin (BTC) Source: TradingView Bitcoin moves between 108819 and 115588 after another green week. The coin added 2.20 % in 7 days and 5.77 % in a month. Over 6 months the chart stands 37.59 % higher, a solid uptrend. Short term traders see price pressing toward the upper part of the band as buyers keep control. The 10 day average price sits near 114322 while the 100 day line is lower at 111907. Momentum stays positive with a strength score near 58 and a fast oscillator around 81, both leaning bullish but not extreme. If demand holds, the market could eye the first resistance at 118916, roughly 3 % above the top of the current range. A clean break over 118916 could launch a run to the next ceiling at 125685, adding close to 9 % from today. Failure to clear that zone opens the door for profit taking toward 105379, a 7 % to 9 % slide, with deeper support at 98610. Given the steady climb and healthy metrics, upside still looks more likely in the coming sessions. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms. Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.0055, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.0056. With an anticipated listing price of $0.10, the token is set to launch on leading CEXs and DEXs. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big.

DATs are a new finance segment bridging TradFi and crypto, drawing both fast money and strategic investors. Corporate treasuries now hold significant BTC and ETH allocations, prompting scrutiny and selective consolidation. Over 1.3M BTC (~$157.7B, 6.6% supply) and 5.5M ETH (~$24B, 4.5% supply) reported in treasury accumulations. Digital asset treasuries bubble signals: DATs face short-term consolidation; monitor liquidity, allocations, and governance. Read analysis & next steps. TON Strategy’s CEO acknowledged there are early signs of a bubble, but medium and long-term capital will soon come in as the market matures. What is causing the digital asset treasuries bubble? Digital asset treasuries (DATs) have surged because corporate treasuries and startups rushed to add crypto as a treasury asset, driven by speculation and “fast money.” Short-term price momentum, high-profile bitcoin treasury pioneers, and easy issuance have amplified demand and created bubble-like indicators. How did industry leaders shape the DAT model? Strategy’s Michael Saylor popularized the DAT approach for Bitcoin; this year the model expanded to Ether, Solana, and Toncoin. TON Strategy CEO Veronika Kapustina said the model now demonstrates cross‑token viability. She told Cointelegraph at Token2049 that DATs differ from prior bubbles because they represent a new financial segment, not just speculative layering. How will digital asset treasuries evolve over time? DATs are likely to undergo consolidation where weaker treasuries fold or merge, while robust treasuries evolve into infrastructure providers or pursue regulated banking pathways. Over time, institutional and medium-to-long-term capital will evaluate DATs by functionality, network security contribution, and governance. What do current treasury accumulation figures show? Corporate treasuries continue to accumulate assets despite high price levels. Plain-text sources reporting these figures include BitcoinTreasuries.NET and StrategicEthReserve. Current tallies indicate significant allocation percentages of circulating supply for major tokens. Corporate treasury accumulation snapshot Asset Held Approx. Value % of Circulating Supply Data Source (plain text) Bitcoin (BTC) ~1.3M BTC ~$157.7B 6.6% BitcoinTreasuries.NET Ether (ETH) ~5.5M ETH ~$24B 4.5% StrategicEthReserve Toncoin (TON) Company treasuries (growing) Variable — TON Strategy reporting Bitcoin DATs continue to load up. Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET. Why might consolidation—not a crash—be the likely outcome? Kapustina explained consolidation occurs when new DATs fail to meet targets and investors separate high‑quality treasuries from speculative ones. Smart capital then reallocates to treasuries demonstrating clear utility, security contributions to networks, and sustainable governance. What are the realistic evolution paths for DATs? Possible paths include: Infrastructure provision and custodial services. Pursuit of banking licenses and regulated product offerings. Mergers & acquisitions among treasury managers. Technology bridges that enable multi-chain treasury operations. Frequently Asked Questions Are digital asset treasuries a long‑term risk to crypto markets? Corporate treasuries concentrate assets, which can amplify systemic risks, but long‑term risk depends on diversification, custody standards, and transparency. Proper governance and regulatory compliance reduce systemic exposure. How can institutional investors evaluate DAT strength? Assess treasury governance, custody providers, transparency of holdings, on‑chain proofs, and alignment with network security goals. Look for audited reserves and experienced treasury managers. Key Takeaways DATs show bubble-like indicators : Rapid inflows and speculative issuance raise short-term risk. Consolidation expected : Weak treasuries may merge or exit while stronger models attract patient institutional capital. Long-term utility matters : DATs that provide network security, governance, and regulated services will likely capture sustainable capital. Conclusion Digital asset treasuries are at an inflection point: current signs resemble a bubble driven by fast money, but market maturation—through consolidation, infrastructure growth, and institutional due diligence—should attract medium-to-long-term capital. Monitor treasury governance, on‑chain allocations, and audited disclosures as leading indicators. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/crypto-treasuries-bubble-2025"" }, ""headline"": ""Experts: Digital Asset Treasuries Show Bubble Signs but Long‑Term Capital Expected"", ""description"": ""Digital asset treasuries show early bubble signs as fast capital floods corporate crypto treasuries, but experts anticipate consolidation followed by institutional inflows."", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/uploads/2025-10/0199a374-30c1-7889-b934-a7505dc6a20f""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is causing the digital asset treasuries bubble?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Rapid corporate allocations, speculative issuance of new DATs, and 'fast money' demand are creating bubble-like indicators, even as long-term utility remains possible for well-governed treasuries."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will DATs crash or consolidate?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Experts expect consolidation where weaker treasuries exit or merge; a systemic crash is less likely if institutional due diligence and governance improve."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How can investors evaluate DAT quality?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Evaluate governance, custody providers, audited holdings, alignment with network security, and track record of treasury managers."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to assess a digital asset treasury (DAT)"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step checklist for evaluating DAT risk and quality."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 1, ""name"": ""Check governance and transparency"", ""text"": ""Confirm public governance documents, audited reserve reports, and on-chain proofs of treasury holdings."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 2, ""name"": ""Verify custody and insurance"", ""text"": ""Ensure reputable custodians, segregation of assets, and insurance coverage for key risks."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 3, ""name"": ""Assess network utility"", ""text"": ""Determine whether treasury allocations contribute to network security, liquidity, or ecosystem growth."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 4, ""name"": ""Review financial resilience"", ""text"": ""Analyze liquidity buffers, risk management policies, and stress-testing outcomes."" } ]}",Analysis|Bitcoin|News|BTC|SOL|TON,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-02 06:09:53

52552842,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=825296,1759386443,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52552842.jpeg,Congressman Begich pushes 1M Bitcoin for U.S. reserve,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/begich-pushes-1m-bitcoin-for-us-reserve/,"Alaska Representative Nick Begich calls for a modernized approach to national reserves, backing a bill that would add one million bitcoins to the U.S. balance sheet as part of a diversification effort. He commented, “I’m a believer that we need to diversify our national balance sheet. We’ve got a heavy emphasis on gold, I think we should have an additional strong emphasis on bitcoin.” Strategy’s Michael Saylor openly supported the BITCOIN Act Begich, together with Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, reintroduced the BITCOIN Act in March, short for the Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide Act. The legislation, if enacted, would formally add Bitcoin to the U.S. reserve strategy, building on Trump’s executive order to hold it permanently like the country’s gold reserves. The measure outlines a five-year strategy to acquire one million bitcoins through cost-neutral means, reinforcing Trump’s directive that confiscated digital assets be retained instead of auctioned. Crypto leaders, including Strategy’s Michael Saylor, have voiced support for the legislation and joined Begich and Lummis at a roundtable to highlight its importance. Introducing the bill, Begich called it a safeguard for “America’s economic future,” emphasizing the need for leadership in the digital age. He noted, “We must lead—not follow—in this digital revolution. The time to act is now.” Recently, he also explained that Bitcoin was chosen over other cryptocurrencies because it has been in the market the longest and has a fixed supply of 21 million. However, he suggested it would be preferable if the U.S. filled the reserve through seized assets rather than direct buying, adding that future versions of the bill could remove the buying requirement altogether. Some believe Begich is pushing for the BITCOIN Act for his personal interests Begich’s proposal has received criticism. Noah Bookbinder, president of CREW, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, for instance, said that even if Begich is acting in good faith, the bill would push up the value of Bitcoin, an asset in the representative’s portfolio, noting a potential conflict of interest. He noted, “This raises all sorts of red flags.” Nonetheless, in response to claims that the initiative would increase the value of his holdings, Begich countered that Bitcoin ownership is widespread. He added that he invests in a variety of assets and said it wouldn’t be fair to avoid pushing for ideas just because they could also benefit him. As of August, Begich held Bitcoin worth $760,000. He claimed he started buying Bitcoin back in 2013 with a $100 purchase. Back in 2014, the Mt. Gox meltdown, however, hit him hard, wiping out the hundreds of Bitcoins he had on the platform. At today’s prices, those lost 440 coins would be worth $48 million. Luckily for him, his earliest Bitcoin buy wasn’t lost in the Mt. Gox fiasco. He held onto those coins, which have since multiplied in value. Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are pressing regulators to expedite Trump’s executive order that enables crypto investments in 401(k) retirement plans . In a letter sent Monday, nine lawmakers, including House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill and Subcommittee on Capital Markets Chair Ann Wagner, urged SEC Chair Paul Atkins to provide “swift assistance” to the Department of Labor in adjusting current rules. They emphasized that under Trump’s August directive on “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors,” the SEC must make alternative assets, including crypto, more accessible in retirement portfolios. The lawmakers noted that they are optimistic that such moves will help the 90 million Americans currently barred from investing in alternative assets to secure a dignified, comfortable retirement. The lawmakers emphasized that every American preparing for retirement should have the opportunity to invest in alternative assets when plan fiduciaries deem it an appropriate way to improve risk-adjusted returns. The letter was signed by Frank D. Lucas, Warren Davidson, Marlin Stutzman, Andrew R. Garbarino, Michael V. Lawler, Troy Downing, and Mike Haridopolos, alongside the lead sponsors.

The plunge triggered waves of retail panic, with many questioning why crypto is going up at some points only to crash days later. Yet seasoned insiders see such shakeouts as opportunities rather than disasters. They are rebalancing away from volatile majors and into fresh projects that show structural resilience. Among these, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being tipped as the best sub-$1 buy with analysts calling for as much as 1200% upside once its full platform is launched. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035. More than $16.6 million has been raised, over 16,700 holders have joined, and 53% of the 170 million tokens allocated to this round are already sold. With only about 47% left before the price climbs to $0.040 in Phase 7, urgency is building. For many investors tracking crypto prices today, this represents one of the last entry points under four cents. $6B liquidated last week Over the past week, more than $6 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum took sharp hits. BTC dropped from around $115,700 to $109,500, while ETH slipped below $4,000, triggering mass liquidations, especially of long contracts. The broader crypto market also suffered, with total capitalization falling by over $240 billion. Analysts say this wave of forced selling reflects extreme leverage in the system and underscores how vulnerable the market is to cascading liquidations when key supports fail. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): resilience through design What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from the assets that saw steep liquidations is its architecture. The project is being built on a dual lending model. Peer-to-Contract lending will allow investors to deposit stablecoins or major tokens directly into audited smart contracts, receiving mtTokens that earn yield while serving as collateral. Alongside this, Peer-to-Peer lending will give room for higher-risk or illiquid assets, kept separate from the main pools to protect systemic liquidity. The system will also anchor itself on a decentralized stablecoin pegged to $1. This will only be minted against overcollateralized positions and automatically burned when debts are repaid or liquidated. Governance will adjust borrowing rates to stabilize the peg, while arbitrage forces will help balance the open market. Limits on issuers will prevent unchecked expansion. In practice, this functions as crypto-native central banking, with in-built safety nets that aim to avoid the kind of cascading collapses seen in BTC and ETH liquidations. Accurate pricing in volatility Price discovery is another core strength of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The protocol will use Chainlink as a primary oracle source, with fallback feeds, aggregated references, and DEX time-weighted averages ensuring redundancy. This multi-layer approach will be crucial during volatile markets, as it guarantees that collateral valuations remain accurate and liquidation thresholds are applied correctly. For whales and institutions scarred by last week’s liquidations, this reliability is a major draw. Borrowing costs will also be stabilized through a utilization-driven model. When capital is abundant, interest rates will stay low to encourage borrowing. When liquidity is scarce, rates will rise to attract more deposits. This dynamic adjustment ensures balance across the system. A lender allocating stablecoins into pools will target strong APY returns while maintaining liquidity, while a borrower locking ETH as collateral will know that repayment terms are tied to transparent utilization rules rather than arbitrary shifts. Revenue recycling into buybacks Another demand driver for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its reward loop for stakers. Users will be able to stake their mtTokens in specialized contracts and earn MUTM. In addition, platform revenues will be directed toward open-market buybacks of MUTM, with repurchased tokens redistributed to stakers. This recycling of revenue creates a system where community participants are directly rewarded as adoption grows. For long-term participants, this structure aligns incentives in a way that builds confidence beyond presale hype. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap is unfolding across four phases. The project began with its presale launch, marketing campaigns, and the initial audit. The current buildout focuses on developing the core smart contracts, decentralized application front-end, and risk management features. Later stages will bring beta testing on the testnet, further audits, and the presale conclusion. Finally, the platform will go live with top exchange listings, bug bounty activation, and multi-chain expansion supported by institutional partnerships. Each milestone represents another step in the credibility analysts use to forecast 1200% returns once the ecosystem matures. Trust anchors and community Security and transparency remain priorities for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project has undergone a CertiK audit with a Token Scan score of 90 and a Skynet score of 79. A $50,000 bug bounty program is set to reward community testers for identifying vulnerabilities, while a $100,000 giveaway campaign continues to build engagement. More than 12,000 followers now track progress across social channels, with both retail and whale investors watching closely. The news about crypto ETFs and regulations may change people’s minds from day to day, but people who work in the industry are focusing on the basics. After losing $6 billion, key players are putting money into a sub-$1 coin that is designed to last. The price will go up to $0.040 next, and 53% of Phase 6 is already gone. The time to get in before that jump is running out fast. Insiders are not panicked; they are positioning themselves. They say that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the solution to the issue of what crypto to buy right now.

Traders favor new crypto as the one to win the $1 race,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/02/can-shib-hit-1-traders-favor-new-crypto-as-the-one-to-win-the-1-race/,"The dream of SHIB reaching $1 has long captured the imagination of retail investors, yet the reality is stark: its massive supply makes such a milestone almost impossible without unprecedented trillions in new inflows. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a tangible path to $1 with strong utility, structured tokenomics, and measurable demand drivers. The current presale highlights this opportunity: Phase 6 has already raised $16.6 million, with more than 16,700 holders participating. Fifty-three percent of the 170 million allocated tokens for this phase have already been sold, and the current price is $0.035, set to rise to $0.040 in Phase 7. This window represents a rare chance for early investors to secure tokens at a discounted rate before the next phase, creating urgency and a clear FOMO signal. SHIB’s road to $1: is this possible? The question of whether Shiba Inu (SHIB) can ever hit $1 continues to spark debate among analysts and retail traders. From a purely mathematical perspective, SHIB reaching $1 would require a market capitalization of over $589 trillion based on its current circulating supply — a figure larger than the combined GDP of the entire world, making it virtually impossible under present conditions. Even with aggressive burning initiatives, such as community and developer-driven token burns, the reduction in supply is happening too slowly to support a price anywhere near $1 in the foreseeable future. Instead, analysts argue that more realistic milestones would be SHIB moving closer to $0.001 or $0.01, provided demand grows through ecosystem expansion like Shibarium, DeFi integrations, and payment adoption. While $1 remains a dream scenario for meme-coin enthusiasts, significant supply cuts and sustained utility growth would be necessary before SHIB could even approach such levels. Real DeFi utility behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed as a purpose-built decentralized finance platform with dual lending mechanics. Peer-to-contract (P2C) pools will handle deposits of stablecoins and blue-chip tokens like BTC and SOL, giving lenders predictable returns and borrowers access to secure liquidity. Peer-to-peer (P2P) desks will isolate more volatile or niche tokens such as memecoins, enabling negotiable loan terms, partial fills, and isolated risk pools to protect the core ecosystem. The protocol will operate on a Layer-2 solution, ensuring low fees and high-throughput lending for participants, which will accelerate adoption and usage. The growth of MUTM will be fueled by several strategic levers. The Beta release at token listing will provide real users with firsthand experience, generating credibility, trust, and network effects. The upcoming stablecoin pegged to $1 will create a sticky on-chain medium of exchange, driving borrowing demand and transactional activity. Layer-2 speed combined with cheap transaction fees will give MUTM a competitive edge over other crypto coins, attracting users who prioritize efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Meanwhile, the buyback and staking reward mechanisms will channel platform revenue into repurchasing MUTM tokens, creating predictable demand and rewarding long-term participants. Planned listings on top exchanges will expand retail accessibility, providing broader visibility and enhancing liquidity. Investment case and comparison to SHIB From an investment standpoint, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a clear and scalable path to significant gains. An investor holding 100,000 MUTM at the current Phase 6 price of $0.035 has a $3,500 position today. If the token reaches $1, this portfolio will be valued at $100,000, and a $2 outcome would value it at $200,000. These returns are grounded in protocol-driven demand, including stablecoin borrowing, staking incentives, and buyback programs. By contrast, SHIB would require near-unimaginable capital inflows to reach the same nominal milestone, making MUTM a more practical choice for those evaluating crypto investment options. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also offers investors transparency and security. The project has undergone a CertiK audit, incorporating manual review and static analysis with TokenScan and Skynet scores of 90 and 79, respectively, and a revised audit timeline of May 20, 2025. A $50,000 bug bounty program will reward ethical hackers, with tiered payouts ranging from $200 to $2,000 depending on severity. The ongoing $100,000 giveaway and a live dashboard with a Top-50 leaderboard will foster community engagement and visibility, creating additional motivation for new participants. For investors debating whether MUTM is a good alternative amidst larger crypto coins, the mix of early discounted access, structured utility, Layer-2 scalability, staking rewards, buybacks, and stablecoin-driven demand makes it a strong case. With Phase 6 more than half sold and Phase 7 slated to boost the price to $0.040, now marks the optimum moment to ensure exposure. A lot of the excitement behind SHIB comes from nostalgia, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set up to give actual DeFi usefulness, demonstrable growth, and a way to get to $1 that is backed by systemic demand. Investing in crypto has always been about discovering enterprises where potential upside coincides with tangible processes. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) brings together many different demand drivers into one organized ecosystem. This ecosystem will reward early players, encourage continued borrowing and lending activities, and keep the market pressure on the tokens to go up in value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the best way to get ahead in the $1 race for anyone who wants to see real gain in the current crypto cycle.

Uptober rally flips sentiment quickly, driving short liquidations and altcoin inflows Short liquidations exceeded $480 million in 24 hours while long liquidations were around $110 million (CoinGlass, plain text). Litecoin led top-cap gains (+10% 24h) as a spot ETF deadline and rotation into “dino coins” fueled the move. Uptober rally: Bitcoin-led market surge flips sentiment, spurs $480M+ short liquidations and altcoin rotation—read key takeaways and expert insight from COINOTAG. What is the Uptober rally and why does it matter? Uptober rally is a seasonal Bitcoin strength in October that often reverses September weakness and broadens market participation. It matters because a sharp Bitcoin advance can trigger short liquidations, shift sentiment from fear to greed, and rotate capital into altcoins, increasing market breadth and volatility. How are short liquidations driving the current market move? Rapid upward price moves forced leveraged short positions to liquidate, producing outsized selling of contracts and fueling further upward momentum. Short liquidations surpassed $480 million in a single 24-hour window, compared with roughly $110 million in long liquidations, per CoinGlass (plain text). That disproportionate culling of bears amplified buying pressure and helped the Crypto Fear and Greed Index climb sharply in days, a clear sentiment swing noted across exchanges and analytics platforms. How has the Uptober rally affected top altcoins? Capital rotation into older Layer 1 tokens and established altcoins lifted several names. Litecoin led large-cap gains, up about 10% in 24 hours to trade near $118 as optimism around a possible spot Litecoin ETF mounted ahead of an October 2 decision deadline. Stellar also rallied, gaining roughly 9% to reach $0.40. Traders cited seasonality and ETF optimism as catalysts while keeping an eye on macro risks such as the U.S. government shutdown and private sector employment data, per market commentary from CoinSwitch (plain text). { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/uptober-rally"" }, ""headline"": ""Uptober Rally: Bitcoin Sparks $480M+ Short Liquidations, Altcoins Surge"", ""description"": ""Uptober rally: Bitcoin-led market surge flips sentiment, spurs $480M+ short liquidations and altcoin rotation—expert insight from COINOTAG."", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"", ""width"": 600, ""height"": 60 } }, ""keywords"": ""Uptober rally, Bitcoin Uptober, short liquidations, altcoins, Litecoin ETF, Stellar, dino coins"", ""articleSection"": ""Market News""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What triggered the recent Uptober rally?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A combination of Bitcoin seasonal strength, ETF optimism for certain assets and heavy short liquidations triggered a rapid market-wide rally and capital rotation into altcoins."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How large were short liquidations during the move?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Short liquidations exceeded $480 million in a 24-hour period, compared with roughly $110 million in long liquidations, according to CoinGlass (plain text)."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to monitor Uptober momentum"", ""description"": ""Quick steps to track the Uptober rally and manage exposure."", ""totalTime"": ""PT10M"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Watch Bitcoin price and volume"", ""text"": ""Monitor BTC price moves and on-chain volume for signs of sustained momentum."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Track liquidations and derivatives flows"", ""text"": ""Review liquidation reports and derivatives open interest to gauge leverage-driven moves."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Follow ETF deadlines and regulatory updates"", ""text"": ""Note key dates, such as ETF decision deadlines, which can shift capital into specific assets."" } ]} Frequently Asked Questions Is Uptober a reliable seasonal pattern for gains? Seasonality has historically favored October for Bitcoin, producing strong monthly returns in many prior years. Seasonality is one factor among many, not a guaranteed outcome for every year. What should traders watch after a short-liquidation-driven rally? Traders should watch for follow-through volume, open interest normalization, and sentiment metrics like the Fear and Greed Index. Manage position sizing given heightened volatility. Key Takeaways Uptober momentum : Seasonal Bitcoin strength can broaden market gains and flip sentiment. Liquidations : Short liquidations topped $480M in 24 hours, significantly outweighing long liquidations. Altcoin rotation : Litecoin and Stellar were early beneficiaries; ETF deadlines and “dino coin” interest accelerated flows. Conclusion The ongoing Uptober rally demonstrates how seasonal Bitcoin strength, derivatives dynamics and ETF-related catalysts can combine to reshape market breadth quickly. Market participants should track liquidation data, ETF timelines and sentiment indicators while managing risk.

Right now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at just $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale. Out of a total 4 billion token supply, more than $16.6 million has already been raised, with over 16,700 holders and 53% of the Phase 6 allocation sold. The next phase will push the price to $0.040, a 15% jump, making this one of the final discounted entries before momentum builds. The mechanics that make this attractive are not hype-based but rooted in revenue generation and token demand. Unlike many speculative crypto coins that rise only on sentiment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is engineered to create continuous buy pressure through its lending protocol, stablecoin issuance, and staking rewards. The combination of early entry pricing and long-term utility is why analysts are discussing price paths that extend toward 45x gains for investors at the current stage. Dual lending framework and liquidation mechanics Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed as a Layer-2 DeFi lending and borrowing protocol with dual lending mechanics. Peer-to-Contract pools will support blue-chip tokens and stablecoins, delivering predictable yields for lenders and borrowing liquidity for institutions. Peer-to-Peer lending will handle higher-risk or lower-liquidity tokens in isolated desks, ensuring core system safety while still unlocking opportunities. The platform will operate on a Stable Interest Rate Model, meaning borrowing costs will rebalance depending on utilization, keeping rates predictable while preventing liquidity crunches. An advanced feature, Efficient Correlated Exposure (ECE), will enhance capital efficiency by allowing correlated assets to be managed in optimized pools. Reserve factor mechanics will direct a portion of interest and penalties into the protocol treasury, creating an income stream that will later fund MUTM token buybacks and staking rewards. The numbers show how this works in practice. A lender depositing $12,000 USDC will receive mtUSDC at a one-to-one rate. Based on utilization-driven yields, this depositor is expected to earn $1,800 annually at a 15% APY. On the borrowing side, someone posting $800 worth of BTC as collateral will borrow stablecoins at up to 70% LTV, keeping exposure to BTC’s upside while gaining liquidity. This combination of lending rewards and borrowing flexibility attracts both conservative lenders and active traders. Collateral and liquidation are structured for resilience. The Stability Factor system will ensure every loan is overcollateralized, while deposit and borrow caps will reduce systemic exposure. The Restricted Collateralization Mode will protect the protocol from illiquid or highly volatile assets. Liquidation penalties will be split between liquidators and the protocol treasury, creating aligned incentives. These governance levers will make the system attractive for institutions looking for safety and transparency, particularly in times when headlines spark questions like Why is crypto down. From presale entry to 45x returns The roadmap for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides four clear drivers for demand that justify analyst projections of a 45x return. The first is the Beta launch, which will enable real platform usage and prove the model to early adopters. The second is Layer-2 integration, reducing fees and boosting throughput to encourage frequent borrowing, repayment, and trading. The third is the buy-and-distribute mechanism, where protocol revenue funds open-market MUTM buybacks for redistribution to stakers, embedding consistent buy pressure. The fourth is the exchange listing strategy, with preparation for major platforms like Coinbase and MEXC, which will expose the token to global demand. The arithmetic is straightforward. Phase 1 buyers at $0.01 are already sitting on 3.5x on paper at the current $0.035. Analysts project that post-listing, the price will move toward $1.575, which is a 45x gain from today’s entry point. This projection is tied directly to growing total value locked, fee revenue cycling back into buybacks, and mtToken staking rewards. Unlike speculative rallies in other markets, these outcomes are tied to real protocol activity and income. Confidence in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is further anchored by security and transparency. The project is undergoing a CertiK audit with a Token Scan score of 90 and a Skynet rating of 79. A 50,000 USDT bug bounty program will reward responsible disclosures up to $2,000 for critical issues. Alongside this, a $100,000 giveaway will distribute $10,000 in MUTM tokens to ten winners, while a live dashboard and Top-50 leaderboard showcase user activity and transparency. The community already spans more than 12,000 Twitter followers and continues to grow as word spreads. Examples of investments show how big the chance is. A Phase 6 investor buying MUTM at $0.035 today will see the price rise to $0.040 in the next phase, delivering an instant 15% uplift before the token even lists. With adoption, buybacks, and access to exchanges, the $1.575 prediction makes a 45x multiple on today’s entry reasonable, giving investors a rare mix of short- and long-term gains. This is the time for investors who want to get in on an early-stage initiative that is based on genuine income mechanisms rather than conjecture. Over half of Phase 6 has already been sold. In a market full of crypto coins that only move because of excitement, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a system with income backing it and room for huge development. If you’re an investor wondering what the next big winner in crypto investment will be, the answer is in the quickly closing discounted window.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-exchange-upbit-announces-listing-of-this-altcoin-on-its-spot-trading-platform-here-are-the-details-11/,"South Korea-based cryptocurrency exchange Upbit has announced the listing of a new digital asset. Upbit Announces DoubleZero (2Z) Listing According to the exchange's official announcement, the token, named DoubleZero (2Z), will be available for deposits and withdrawals on the Solana network starting at 9:00 PM on October 2. An hour later, at 10:00 PM, it will begin trading with KRW, BTC, and USDT pairs. Upbit emphasized that users can only deposit and withdraw 2Z using the Solana network. It noted that transactions made on the wrong network will not be valid and the refund process may take longer. The contract address designated for 2Z was also shared with investors. The exchange announced that certain restrictions will be implemented at the opening of trading. Accordingly, buy orders will be limited for approximately five minutes from the moment trading begins. Furthermore, only limit orders will be accepted for the first two hours. DoubleZero stands out as a project aiming to provide high-performance communication infrastructure for blockchains. Leveraging unused fiber optic networks, the project aims to reduce network bottlenecks for validators, RPC nodes, MEV systems, and L2 solutions by providing low latency and high bandwidth. DoubleZero, which participated in the testnet phase with over 140 validators, has managed approximately 16% of the total stake on Solana through its network. The project's native token, 2Z, will be used for transaction fees, rewards for network participants, and staking. *This is not investment advice.

The Tether-backed Layer-1 stablecoin-focused payments network came under fire this week after online chatter that team members had sold locked XPL tokens spread. Trying to calm the community, Paul issued a rebuttal statement on X on Thursday, insisting that no such sales had taken place. “No team members have sold any XPL,” he wrote. “All investor and team XPL is locked for three years with a one-year cliff.” Accusations spew in relations with other projects The allegations directed at Plasma went beyond insider token sales to accusations that most members of its development team came from Blast and Blur, two projects that are down 99% from their all-time-high price levels at the time of this publication. Faecks told the community that only three of Plasma’s roughly 50 employees had worked at either Blast or Blur. “Our team members also come from Google, Facebook, Square, Temasek, Goldman Sachs, and Nuvei. To say our team is ‘ex-Blast’ is to say it is ‘ex’ of any of these firms. We are proud of the team we’ve assembled at Plasma,” he surmised. The project founder also addressed the rumors about supposed token transfers to Wintermute, a London-based market-making firm. On-chain data shared by an anonymous account on X suggested large quantities of XPL were moved from the Plasma Team Vault to exchanges, totaling more than 600 million tokens by late September. OK so I actually dug into what happened with $XPL , the vaults, and the Wintermute accusations. First, I wanted to see where the Plasma Team Vault was sending their tokens so I looked at each notable transfer from their vault. Vault address:… https://t.co/xZgm9D2u0U pic.twitter.com/lKbWmuh2AA — ManaMoon (@ManaMoonNFT) September 30, 2025 According to the analysis, approximately 250 million XPL were sent to Binance, 120 million to Bitfinex, and another 260 million to other centralized exchanges. The account, going by the username ManaMoonNFT, suggested Wintermute wallets may have handled a significant share of these tokens, adding fuel to the suspicions of coordinated selling by the Plasma team. “The Wintermute Binance deposit also received a lot of tokens from exchanges and seemed to have started marketmaking a bit on day 1, but the activity and size of tokens moved seemed to increase starting day 2… If team selling happened, it was probably on Binance,” the user wrote. Faecks denied having any relationship with Wintermute by insisting Plasma “has not engaged Wintermute as a market maker.” “We have never contracted with Wintermute for any of their services. We have the same information as the public on Wintermute’s ownership of XPL. Plasma is laser-focused on building the future of money and won’t be commenting further. Now back to work,” the founder concluded. XPL public sale and token allocations XPL is the native token of Plasma that facilitates transaction settlement, staking rewards for validators, and ecosystem incentives. According to the project developers, the token has a similar function to Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain and Ether on Ethereum, acting as both a utility and reward mechanism. During its public sale held on July 17, 10% of the 10 billion tokens XPL supply, equivalent to one billion tokens, was distributed to deposit campaign participants. Coins purchased by non-US buyers were unlocked at the launch of Plasma’s public mainnet beta on September 25, while those acquired by US investors are subject to a 12-month lock-up ending July 2026. According to Plasma’s insight on XPL allocations. 40% of the total supply, or four billion tokens, were reserved for ecosystem and growth purposes. Of this total, 800 million were unlocked immediately at mainnet beta to fund liquidity, DeFi incentives, and exchange integrations. 3.2 billion tokens are being released monthly over three years, reaching full unlock by the third anniversary of the mainnet beta, which falls around September 2028. The development team holds about 2.5 billion tokens locked under a one-year cliff for one-third of the allocation and gradual release of the remainder over two years, as Paul insinuated.

Avalanche Treasury Co. announced on Wednesday that it will merge with Mountain Lake Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), in a transaction valued at over $675 million. The combined business intends to list on Nasdaq under the ticker “AVAT” during the first quarter of 2026, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. Ava Labs founder and CEO Emin Gün Sirer will join as an adviser, marking another step for institutional involvement in the Avalanche ecosystem. This venture is only the second dedicated Avalanche-focused treasury company and reflects a broader trend of firms going public or shifting toward cryptocurrency accumulation this year. Exclusive Relationship With Avalanche Foundation Avalanche Treasury Co. said it has an “exclusive relationship” with the Avalanche Foundation, the nonprofit supporting the blockchain. According to reports, the foundation has considered selling millions of AVAX tokens at discounted prices to treasury companies, providing a pipeline for large-scale acquisitions. The company aims to hold more than $1 billion worth of AVAX following its public debut next year. It expects its initial capital raise to produce approximately $460 million in funded treasury assets. AVAX Price Reacts to News The market responded quickly to the announcement. AVAX climbed to an intraday high of $31.32 shortly after the news and remains up 2.3% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. Backing for the merger has come from an array of crypto-focused venture firms and companies, including Dragonfly, VanEck, FalconX, Monarq, Galaxy Digital, Pantera Capital, CoinFund, and Kraken. Former Susquehanna Crypto CEO Bart Smith has been named the CEO of Avalanche Treasury Co., bringing traditional market-making experience to the project. Moving Beyond Passive Holdings Avalanche Treasury Co. emphasized that its strategy goes beyond simple token accumulation. The company plans to generate revenue through “targeted protocol investments” and will establish its own validator infrastructure to support the network. It also intends to help enterprises tokenize real-world assets and stablecoins on Avalanche. “Many institutions have difficulty accessing digital assets or are limited to holding native tokens without yield or ecosystem integration,” Smith said. “We created Avalanche Treasury Co. to offer something we believe will be more valuable than passive exposure.” Competing for Market Share This new company joins a wave of similar ventures. AgriFORCE Growing Systems recently announced plans to rebrand as AVAX One and acquire $700 million worth of AVAX, reflecting rising competition for large-scale positions in Avalanche’s token supply. Avalanche Treasury Co. stated that it will begin with an initial AVAX purchase at a discount to market price. It also secured an 18-month priority on Avalanche Foundation token sales to U.S. digital asset treasury firms. The company said it is targeting a multiple of net asset value (mNAV) of 0.77 — a 23% discount compared with buying AVAX directly. However, some analysts have criticized the mNAV metric, arguing it does not accurately represent a company’s financial health.",Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|AVAX|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-02 06:58:08

Claims Against Coinbase The ruling , issued by US District Judge Brian Martinotti in Newark, New Jersey, comes as a response to claims that Coinbase misled investors regarding its regulatory standing and the safety of their assets. The Judge rejected requests from the crypto exchange executives and directors to dismiss the lawsuit entirely. The shareholders contend that the company misrepresented the likelihood of an SEC lawsuit regarding its operations as an unregistered securities exchange, leading them to believe that such an action was improbable. They also argue that Coinbase failed to disclose the alleged risks associated with asset loss in the event of a bankruptcy filing . The judge pointed out that while shareholders could not base their claims solely on “group pleading,” they can pursue claims that provide detailed allegations against specific parties. Martinotti emphasized that claims grounded in particularized allegations must be allowed to proceed, stating, “Where plaintiffs have appropriately provided defendant-by-defendant particularity, the claims must remain.” Shareholder Legal Teams Remain Silent The ruling, which spans 59 pages, does not outline which specific statements were dismissed due to the group pleading issue, as neither party identified those in their arguments. As Reuters reported, Martinotti noted in a footnote that “Judges are not like pigs, hunting for truffles buried in briefs,” highlighting the importance of clarity in legal documentation . The proposed class action suit is spearheaded by the Swedish pension fund Sjunde AP-Fonden and encompasses Coinbase shareholders from April 14, 2021, to June 5, 2023. In February, the Securities and Exchange Commission had concluded its lawsuit against the exchange as regulatory scrutiny on the cryptocurrency industry began to ease under the Trump administration. Others, such as Uniswap, Robinhood, and Kraken, have also had their lawsuits dismissed by the regulator this year. Trump’s appointment of Paul Atkins as the new chair has been a positive development, providing clear regulatory frameworks and collaborations to boost the adoption and usage of cryptocurrency in the country. At the time of writing, neither Coinbase nor its shareholders’ legal representatives have commented on the judge’s ruling. It remains to be seen what actions the firm will take and whether its executives will issue an official comment. Despite the judge’s decision, the exchange’s stock, which trades on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol COIN, surged towards $347 on Wednesday, marking gains of almost 12%. This aligns with the broader crypto market recovery, led by Bitcoin (BTC), which is approaching record highs.

With the recent enactment of the GENIUS Act, which establishes a new regulatory framework for stablecoins and cryptocurrency firms issuing dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, Tether is eager to capitalize on these developments. Tether’s US Market Comeback In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, reaffirmed the firm’s plans to launch a new token, USAT, designed to comply with US regulations. Central to Tether’s strategy is its partnership with Rumble, a growing video platform with a substantial user base. Related Reading: Did Bitcoin Top? Top Trader Warns Of Brutal $98,000 Liquidity Sweep Notably, Tether holds a 48% stake in Rumble, following a notable $775 million investment in the company made in 2024. Ardoino emphasized the significance of Rumble’s 51 million monthly active users, stating, “That is already a huge amount of users if you compare to what the competition has now in the United States.” The US stablecoin market includes Circle (CRCL), the issuer of the second-largest dollar-pegged cryptocurrency, USD Coin (USDC), and a host of new entrants in the stablecoin arena. The Trump administration has prioritized the growth of privately issued stablecoins, particularly through the GENIUS Act, which aims to create a supportive environment for issuers. Tether, having faced scrutiny in the past—including a $41 million fine for allegedly misrepresenting its reserves—has recently made a concerted effort to re-establish its foothold in the US market. Aiming For $500 Billion Valuation With a profit of $4.9 billion recorded in the second quarter of the year, Tether has strategically invested its reserves in cash-like assets, including US Treasuries, generating significant interest income. The company’s recent ventures also extend into various industries, encompassing artificial intelligence (AI), energy, and commodities. Ardoino outlined that Rumble’s upcoming crypto wallet will play a crucial role not only for USAT but also for Tether’s tokenized gold product. Rumble’s CEO, Chris Pavlovski, echoed Ardoino’s sentiments, stating that the partnership embodies the principles of free speech and decentralized finance (DeFi). “Rumble represents free speech just as Tether’s cryptocurrency and a decentralized internet represent true liberty,” he noted, highlighting the shared vision that unites the two companies. Related Reading: XRP Flips Green For First Time Since 2017, Pundit Predicts 500% Rally Additionally, Tether is seeking to raise up to $20 billion for a 3% stake, potentially valuing the company at around $500 billion. Ardoino described this valuation as a bargain, although he did not provide detailed calculations. Should this fundraising effort succeed, Tether plans to allocate part of the proceeds towards developing an artificial intelligence platform designed to function on low-cost smartphones in emerging markets, particularly in Africa and South America. Tether’s CEO also mentioned the creation of an offline, artificial intelligence-powered language translation application as part of this initiative.

The program lets crypto projects give away branded devices that give out daily rewards in their own tokens. The move takes tokens out of exchanges and wallets and puts them into homes and everyday life. From In-House Devices to Whitelabel Expansion Codego first introduced CDG Home and CDG Power Home devices . The main aspects to know about these products is: the connection to a decentralized GPU network, and the possibility to generate daily revenue in tokens. Going a bit deeper, the team explained that, under the Whitelabel Device Program, rewards will be distributed in USDC through Codego’s app. The model has proven simple and effective: a device in the home that provides consistent daily payouts. The new program extends this framework to other projects. Partners can now release their own branded versions, with the same technology delivering rewards in their tokens. A New Layer of Utility for the Token Economy It is the team’s opinion that tokens existing only on exchanges risk fading from relevance. Tokens delivered daily through a tangible device gain visibility, trust, and persistence. Regular payouts create habits, strengthen loyalty, and give tokens staying power. Another important thing to mention is that projects can gain new channels for adoption. Also, users see tokens tied to consistent rewards, and not as abstract speculation entities. For partners, the model opens additional revenue streams through device sales and recurring margins. Strategy, Influence, and Power The team working at Codego has a clear long-term view for the project and the whole crypto community. For instance, here are three key features to consider: Home devices help the token's brand and presence stand out. Daily rewards make people closer to the system. This strategy makes it less convenient for anyone to leave ecosystems. Also, a token given out by a real system has the potential of gaining credibility on the market. This is because it’s possible to link real utility to a cryptocurrency. In other words, this system aims to go beyond mere speculation, and to enter the market with real, tangible value. Codego Group is regulated as an Electronic Money Institution and already provides services such as Banking-as-a-Service, Cards-as-a-Service, and Device-as-a-Service. The Whitelabel Device Program brings something new to the table, forcing crypto tokens from speculative devices to owning real-world utility. It builds a foundation where tokens integrate into daily life, offering relevance and stability in a volatile market. About Codego Codego Group builds the financial and blockchain infrastructure that businesses and people use. It offers services for payments, banking, and devices. The recent launch is a big step in the company’s overall roadmap. In fact, it potentially increases the adoption of crypto tokens in various sectors. Partners receive USDC directly from Codego while distributing their own tokens to users through branded devices. Codego gives projects tools that make them more resilient and relevant by putting tokens into everyday life.

Next Top $8,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-cup-handle-pattern-almost-complete-next-top-8/,"Crypto analyst CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) recently shared his outlook on XRP, pointing to a developing technical formation on the weekly chart. In his post, he noted that the XRP cup & handle setup is almost complete. The chart he shared shows the digital asset trading at $2.83, with a pattern forming across several months. #XRP cup and handle pattern almost complete. Next stop $8. pic.twitter.com/XfVpKrKSDK — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) September 30, 2025 Understanding the pattern The chart displays a long, rounded bottom extending from late 2024 into mid-2025, representing the cup portion of the structure. This section formed as the asset’s price rose rapidly between November 2024 and January 2025, and then began falling in early February . This decline continued into April when XRP hit the bottom of the cup formation. However, the asset began a gradual recovery in the following months, and this uptrend picked up steam in July, pushing XRP to an all-time high of $3.65 . This recovery completed the cup formation. However, the weeks following that surge put XRP in another consolidation phase and began forming the handle. In late August, the asset dipped below $3, and this decline carried into early September when it fell to $2.71 . The Cup and Handle Pattern Cup and handle formations are widely followed in technical analysis because they suggest a continuation of upward momentum if the breakout occurs above the handle resistance. The structure often signals a possible strong rally, provided that trading volumes support the move. The handle typically reflects a pause before a potential breakout, as market participants reassess before making a decisive move. This consolidation phase is much shorter, and on the chart shared by CryptoBull, XRP’s recent candles align with the expected final stages of the handle. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Measuring Potential Gains With XRP currently priced at $2.83, the $8 target represents a projected increase of about 182%. Analysts who examine this pattern often calculate potential upside by measuring the depth of the cup and projecting it upward from the breakout level. The cup formed for over nine months, while the handle has been developing for about two months, with price action consolidating just under the resistance level. This timing aligns with the typical structure of the pattern, where the handle is shorter relative to the cup, yet remains a key confirmation stage. A move toward $8 would put XRP at unprecedented heights. However, the validity of the move depends on whether the digital asset can sustain momentum and close decisively above the horizontal resistance marked on the chart.

The market’s gaze is shifting: while Ethereum itself may surge, many eyes are now on Ethereum-based or ERC-20 coins that could deliver outsized returns. In the current climate, talk of a “next big altcoin in 2025” is loud and some tokens are already being whispered among insiders as candidates for 20× moves before year end. But FOMO isn’t blind. You want tokens with real utility, momentum, and catalysts. One such token is a rising star in the PayFi space that many are calling the best crypto to buy. Ethereum Price Prediction: Mature Powerhouse, But Can It Still 20×? Ethereum is the backbone of the DeFi project ecosystem and remains the go-to layer-2 / layer-1 hub for smart contracts, NFTs, and tokenization. Yet, because ETH’s market cap is already immense, doubling or tripling is plausible but 20× would require a structural paradigm shift or off-the-chart adoption. Some Ethereum price predictions show that it could push toward $5,000–$6,000. ETH is currently trading in the $4,000–$4,500 range but many bullish scenarios still fall short of 20× from current levels. That’s why many speculative capital flows toward undervalued crypto projects on the hunt for the next 100× — and why Remittix is getting loud whispers across trader chats. Remittix (RTX): The PayFi Altcoin That Could 20× Remittix is emerging as one of the most talked-about ETH ecosystem tokens and that talk is starting to sound like investor mania. While others chase DeFi narratives, Remittix is building a payments bridge between crypto and real bank networks. It’s positioning itself as a cross-chain, low gas-fee crypto solution for real world remittances. Remittix has already crossed more than $26.8 million raised in its token distribution phase. It secured confirmed listings on centralized exchanges like BitMart and LBank. The Remittix Web3 wallet is now in beta, supporting Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Tron and promising real-time FX conversion and direct fiat payouts. And it just earned a top ranking from CertiK, now verified and touted as the #1 pre-launch token for security. When you stack Remittix against rivals, it shows muscle: a focus on real utility, a payments corridor built into its architecture, and demand already growing among cross-border payment users. Many are calling it “XRP 2.0” and treating it as one of the best crypto to buy now. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction Global Reach: crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries Utility & Real-World Use: supports 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies Wallet Beta Launched: with real-time FX and user-friendly interface Deflationary Tokenomics: burn mechanics to boost scarcity Institutional & CEX Momentum: liquidity planning, audit backing, exchange listings Remittix blends payments infrastructure with DeFi sensibility. It’s not just a token—it’s a bridge for regular people to use crypto in everyday life. Among early stage crypto investment circles, it’s already being whispered as the next big altcoin. It’s cheap enough now that if it hits big adoption or listing volume, 20× becomes less fantasy and more possibility. Remittix $250,000 Giveaway & Referral Incentives Now here’s where FOMO gets real: Remittix is running a $250,000 giveaway to juice momentum and reward community believers. On top of that, the project just launched a referral program: refer new buyers and earn 15% of their purchase in USDT, claimable every 24 hours. Early testers say it’s already paying out serious cash for those who share their link. More proof of its traction: over 25,000 holders are in the community, and the giveaway campaign has pulled in 300,000+ entries on Gleam. Whales are stacking, retail is sliding in, and buzz is building. With CertiK verification now in place, the legitimacy bar has climbed. The clock is ticking—join now or risk missing the wave.

Each crypto crash today forces traders to rethink how they position for the future and ask crypto is a good investment when the market shifts without warning. Analysts are now turning to protocols designed to turn volatility into opportunity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being highlighted as one of the most compelling names, with expectations that its combination of capital efficiency and buyback-driven tokenomics will enable it to deliver as much as 900% upside by 2026. The presale for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is progressing with strong momentum. Phase 6 is priced at $0.035 and has generated approximately $16.7 million so far. More than half of the 170,000,000 tokens allocated for this stage are already sold, with the percentage now standing at 55%. Holder numbers exceed 16,750, showing consistent growth in participation. The total supply of MUTM is 4 billion tokens. When Phase 7 begins, the price will advance to $0.040, representing a 15% increase from today’s level. BTC volatility near $108K Bitcoin continues to face persistent volatility near the $108,000 zone, as bulls and bears battle for control in a tight range. Reports suggest the market is entering a “ping-pong” phase, with price oscillating between $108K and $112K, rather than breaking decisively in either direction. In the past 24 hours alone, BTC fell ~3.6%, intensifying uncertainty and triggering stop-outs around key support levels. Analysts warn that failure to sustain above $108K could open paths toward lower zones like $105K, while a clean reclaim of resistance could reignite upside momentum. With macro drivers like US jobs data and Fed commentary looming, crypto traders are bracing for sharp intraday swings — the kind of volatility often seen when markets sit near major pivots. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dual lending structure The foundation of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rests on a split architecture that balances reliability with opportunity. Its Peer-to-Contract pools cover stablecoins and major tokens like ETH and BTC, while Peer-to-Peer markets specialize in high-risk and volatile tokens. Depositors who provide liquidity receive mtTokens, which represent their growing share of pool earnings and can also be used as collateral. Borrowers engage by posting assets, selecting between variable and stable interest rates, and staying within the clearly defined loan-to-value limits. Stable borrowing options start higher but deliver predictability, while variable rates fluctuate according to liquidity demand. A projection of 900% upside translates into a 10× return on the current price, placing the target at $0.35 per MUTM. This trajectory rests on four structural drivers that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will activate as its ecosystem develops. The first is the utilization-based interest model that expands the total value locked. When pools become more fully used, the interest rates rise, attracting even more deposits. For example, an investor depositing $10,000 DAI into mtDAI at 15% APY will earn $1,500 over the year. That type of return attracts capital, boosting TVL and expanding the revenue stream feeding back into MUTM. The second driver is the reserve factor, which accumulates over time as a portion of interest fees is diverted into protocol reserves. These reserves can then be redeployed into treasury operations, expanding utility and enabling buybacks that consistently enhance token demand. Third, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) employs liquidity-aware liquidation mechanics. When liquidity in a market is thin, incentives for liquidators increase. This ensures that unhealthy positions are resolved quickly without introducing systemic instability, protecting both lenders and the wider protocol. Finally, buybacks and staking rewards create a continuous demand sink for MUTM. As platform revenue and liquidation penalties cycle back into token repurchases and staker distributions, long-term participants are rewarded directly in proportion to platform usage. Protective collateralization and risk limits The protocol enforces strict overcollateralization requirements to protect lenders. Loan-to-value ratios are customized based on asset risk, while deposit and borrow caps prevent sudden imbalances. A restricted collateral mode is also in place to limit the influence of high-volatility assets. This ensures that even if price manipulation is attempted on fringe assets, the effect cannot cascade across the system. The roadmap for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) positions the project to accelerate adoption at the time of its token listing. A beta version of the platform will launch alongside exchange availability, ensuring real product use begins from day one. With Layer-2 integration, users will benefit from significantly reduced costs and faster transaction times, boosting activity and reinforcing confidence. Expected Tier-1 exchange listings are also expected to elevate visibility, making MUTM accessible to a global base of traders. These combined milestones will transform presale momentum into active, utility-driven demand. Investor confidence is being further bolstered by a strong emphasis on security and incentives. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has undergone review with CertiK, earning a Token Scan score of 90.00 and a Skynet score of 79.00. Beyond the audit, the team has established a $50,000 bug bounty program to reward community members who detect vulnerabilities. To widen early distribution, a $100,000 giveaway campaign is also underway. Together, these initiatives expand both trust and participation. Investor example and closing view The presale performance already demonstrates the kind of speed traders want. A person who joined in Phase 2 at $0.015 currently owns assets worth $0.035, which is a 2.3× gain. When the $0.35 aim is attained, the same investment will be worth 23.3X the entrance price. Phase 6 is already more than halfway sold, and the following stage is at $0.040, so people are getting more and more urgent. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gives a more stable foundation in a world where crypto projections typically miss the mark since the market is so volatile. Its mix of revenue from use, reserves, buybacks, and protective liquidation processes makes it strong for the long run. As traders wonder if crypto is a good investment amid uncertain BTC cycles, platforms like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) may have the solution. They use innovation and security to turn volatility into huge gains.

Plans $1B Token Purchase and Public Listing,https://cryptonews.com/news/avax-surges-as-avalanche-treasury-co-plans-1b-token-purchase-and-public-listing/,"AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche blockchain, climbed sharply on Wednesday following the announcement of a public listing and major token purchase by Avalanche Treasury Co., a new entity formed to back the ecosystem. Key Takeaways: Avalanche Treasury Co. plans to buy $1 billion in AVAX, starting with $460 million in initial funds. The company will go public via a $675M SPAC deal and list on Nasdaq under the ticker “AVAT” in 2026. It has secured a priority deal with the Avalanche Foundation for discounted AVAX token sales. The company revealed it will merge with Mountain Lake Acquisition Corp. , a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), in a $675 million deal. The merger sets the stage for Avalanche Treasury Co. to debut on the Nasdaq under the ticker “AVAT” in early 2026, pending regulatory and shareholder approval. Avalanche Treasury Kicks Off $1B AVAX Buy with $460M in Initial Funds At the heart of the strategy is a $1 billion AVAX acquisition plan. The company says its initial capital raise will contribute roughly $460 million in treasury assets, with the rest expected to follow after listing. The firm claims an exclusive partnership with the Avalanche Foundation, giving it early access to discounted token sales. AVAX responded positively to the news, hitting $31.32 intraday before settling slightly lower. As of Thursday morning, the token remained up 2.3% over 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. Avalanche Treasury Co. is the second dedicated treasury vehicle formed around the Avalanche ecosystem. Its leadership includes former Susquehanna Crypto head Bart Smith as CEO and Avalanche creator Emin Gün Sirer as a company adviser. Backing the venture are major crypto investors including Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, VanEck, CoinFund, Dragonfly, FalconX, Kraken, and Monarq. The company isn’t stopping at token accumulation.

(@avat_co) October 1, 2025 The structure reflects a growing trend of companies rebranding or pivoting to digital asset treasuries. Last month, AgriFORCE Growing Systems announced plans to rename itself AVAX One and purchase $700 million worth of AVAX tokens. Avalanche Treasury Co. also announced it would receive an 18-month priority window for future AVAX token sales by the Avalanche Foundation, further reinforcing its strategic position. The firm says it will purchase AVAX at a discount, claiming a 0.77 mNAV, roughly 23% below market value. Crypto Treasury Craze Unravels as Firms Turn to Debt-Fueled Buybacks The crypto treasury strategy that gained traction among small-cap firms in 2024 is beginning to unravel, with several companies now launching debt-funded share buybacks to counter plunging stock prices. At least seven firms, including those in gaming, biotech, and EV sectors, are now trading below the value of their crypto holdings, raising red flags among investors and analysts. Critics say the tactic signals desperation and a departure from the original idea that crypto appreciation alone would drive shareholder value. Notable cases include ETHZilla (formerly 180 Life Sciences), which saw its stock drop 76% despite accumulating ether and rebranding. The company recently secured $80 million in debt to finance a $250 million buyback. Meanwhile, Empery Digital (formerly Volcon) holds $476 million in BTC but has a market cap of just $378 million, prompting it to expand its debt facility for similar repurchases. A recent report from K33 Research reveals that 25% of public companies holding Bitcoin now trade at market values below the worth of their BTC holdings, highlighting a sharp drop in investor confidence.

Price Nears Long-Term Resistance XRP is currently trading near a major resistance level formed by its previous all-time high. Based on a multi-phase chart pattern shared by CW, the current market phase has historically aligned with strong upward price movement. The asset remains just below the key breakout zone. Targets above this level include $6.61 and $21.5, based on technical projections. Market attention is also on reports that an XRP ETF may be approved by mid-month.

If Bitcoin was going to run a catch-up to gold, it would imply now is the time, said venture capitalist Chris Burniske. “Gold has a head start, but we all know how it will end,” added trader Luke Martin. Last month, analyst Miles Deutscher described the increasing gold prices as an anchor for Bitcoin, implying that it will be pulled up after the lag. Gold has gained a whopping 47% since the beginning of this year, which is monumental for the usually slow-moving precious yellow metal. Comparatively, Bitcoin has gained just 27% since January 1, and coming second to the commodity is very rare. “The good news for Bitcoin is that sooner or later, gold will get tired,” said ByteTree analyst Charlie Morris last week. Earlier this year, head of growth at Theya, Joe Consorti, said Bitcoin follows gold’s directional bias with a lag of 100-150 days, saying, “When the printer roars to life, gold sniffs it out first, then Bitcoin follows.” “Monetary easing and seller exhaustion give BTC the same macro backdrop as last year’s surge past $100,000,” he said on Wednesday before predicting: “If BTC rises by October’s historical average, $150,000 by Halloween may be in store.” October is here, and bitcoin is off to a strong start.

Gold prices have been surging in recent months due to trade uncertainty from tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Central banks have also been buying gold while economic uncertainty and geopolitical risks have increased. Meanwhile, the US dollar has weakened by 12% this year, and inflation continues to be a problem in many countries, prompting investors to flock to the safe-haven commodity. The good news for crypto investors is that Bitcoin usually follows, while end-of-year and bull market seasonality could see a solid couple of months ahead for digital gold.

This update reduces the transaction cost on the network to approximately $0.005. The official announcement stated that all BSC validators and developers have adopted the new gas price and the network is ready to accept transactions at this rate. BNB Chain argued that this step would provide faster and cheaper transactions for users, offer wider innovation space for developers, and increase the competitiveness of the ecosystem. The network team also stated that wallets, centralized exchanges (CEX), and trading platforms should also adapt to the 0.05 Gwei rate. Changpeng Zhao (CZ), founder of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, recently proposed cutting gas fees in half. The community and validators mobilized after this proposal, bringing it to life.

While short-term pullbacks remain possible, the market structure now favours continuation toward $120K–$124K, where the next significant supply block and sell-side liquidity cluster await. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, BTC has reclaimed the 100-day MA ($114K) and surged through the midpoint of its consolidation range, pressing into the $118K zone just beneath the broader $120K–$124K supply block. This area coincides with a major order block from prior distribution, making it a critical level. The surge confirms a bullish breakout from the recent major swing high, weakening the broader corrective structure. Although the daily candles show some rejection around $118K, the medium-term structure remains constructive. As long as BTC holds above the $112K–$114K zone — now turned into support — the path of least resistance points higher toward $120K–$124K. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour structure illustrates the breakout most clearly. After consolidating above $114K, Bitcoin broke through descending resistance, sweeping buy-side liquidity above $116K and pressing into the $118K liquidity pool. If a pullback unfolds, the $114K–$115K demand block is the key decision point. Sustained bids here would provide the fuel for another push into the $120K–$124K supply cluster. Failure to defend it, however, could drag the price back toward $110K, though this currently appears less likely, given the momentum. On-chain Analysis By Shayan The liquidation heatmap further validates the technical picture by highlighting the dense liquidity clusters currently in play. As Bitcoin rallied from the $109K demand base into the current range, a significant portion of short positions was forced out of the market, which fueled the impulsive move higher. The heatmap now shows that a particularly heavy concentration of liquidity has formed just above the $118K–$120K region, which is exactly where the price is currently facing resistance. This cluster reflects a build-up of short positions at that level, and if Bitcoin sustains momentum above $118K, the probability of that liquidity being swept grows substantially. The forced liquidations triggered by such a move could act as a catalyst for an extended rally, pushing the asset deeper into the $120K–$124K supply zone. Beyond this immediate resistance, the heatmap also highlights much larger liquidity concentrations sitting above the $124K swing highs, extending into the $130K–$135K region. These pools act as magnets for price in the medium term, suggesting that if the $120K barrier is cleared convincingly, the market may accelerate toward these higher ranges in search of liquidity. On the downside, liquidity below current levels is far less concentrated compared to what sits overhead. This relative imbalance indicates that the path of least resistance remains tilted upward, provided that the $114K–$115K reclaimed support continues to hold. The recent rally has already flushed sellers from the $109K base and cleared a large portion of downside liquidity, leaving the market positioned to build on its breakout. In summary, the heatmap confirms what the structural analysis already suggests: Bitcoin has entered into a new bullish phase, with shorts squeezed from lower levels and liquidity now stacked higher, making the $120K–$124K region the next key battleground. A decisive clearance of this zone could then set the stage for a move into the $124K–$130K liquidity band.

Key Takeaways: Zach Witkoff aims to tokenize Trump family real estate, starting with projects like Trump Tower Dubai. The plan seeks to give everyday investors access to high-end real estate via blockchain. World Liberty Financial and ALT5 Sigma are exploring tokenized asset offerings but have not confirmed direct involvement yet. Speaking at the Token2049 conference in Singapore alongside Donald Trump Jr., Witkoff outlined a vision to make landmark properties like Trump Tower Dubai investable through tokenized shares, according to a report by Bloomberg . “The Trump family has one of the most exciting real estate asset portfolios in the world,” he said. “What if I told you that you could go on an exchange and buy one token of Trump Tower Dubai?” Early Tokenization Plan Aims to Open Premium Real Estate to the Public The plan, still in early stages, would mark a significant step toward democratizing access to premium real estate. “Why don’t you have access to investing in Class A real estate?” Witkoff asked. “Right now, you can only do that through a REIT or a public corporation.” World Liberty Financial, founded last year in partnership with the Trump family, already issues a stablecoin called USD1 and has plans to offer lending and borrowing features. Witkoff also chairs ALT5 Sigma, a publicly traded treasury firm holding WLFI, another token issued by World Liberty. ALT5 promotes itself as a platform enabling businesses to issue and trade tokenized assets across asset classes, including real estate and private funds. Witkoff stopped short of confirming whether World Liberty or ALT5 would directly handle the tokenization. However, the ambition is to open up traditionally gated assets to a broader investor base using blockchain infrastructure. World Liberty Financial is taking over Singapore at Token 2049. The future of finance is here. pic.twitter.com/dOI13wynME — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) October 1, 2025 Tokenizing real estate has lagged behind other real-world asset initiatives due to regulatory complexity and a history of failed projects. But the momentum is shifting. Major firms like BlackRock have tokenized shares of money-market funds, and tokenized ETFs have started gaining traction this year. The Trump family’s crypto pivot has accelerated in 2024, with ventures spanning Bitcoin mining, memecoins, and crypto ETFs. Now, their sprawling global real estate footprint may be the next asset class to meet blockchain rails. Among the most anticipated projects is the 80-story Trump Tower International Hotel and Tower in Dubai, featuring a private members-only club called “The Trump,” panoramic views of the Burj Khalifa, and luxury penthouses with sky pools. Tokenized Real-World Assets May Unlock $400T TradFi Market In a recent research, Web3 digital property firm Animoca Brands said that tokenization of RWAs could unlock a $400 trillion traditional finance market. Animoca researchers Andrew Ho and Ming Ruan said the global market for private credit, treasury debt, commodities, stocks, alternative funds, and bonds represents a vast runway for growth. “The estimated $400 trillion addressable TradFi market underscores the potential growth runway for RWA tokenization,” they wrote. Meanwhile, according to the 2025 Skynet RWA Security Report, the market for tokenized RWAs could grow to $16 trillion by 2030 . Tokenized U.S. Treasuries alone are projected to reach $4.2 billion this year, with short-term government bonds driving most of the activity. Institutional interest is accelerating, with major banks, asset managers, and blockchain-native firms exploring tokenization for yield and liquidity management.

With speculation building around potential catalysts, such as ETF-related decisions, regulatory clarity, and institutional inflows, forecasts about XRP’s short-term trajectory are drawing significant attention. Artificial intelligence has increasingly been in market analysis, and ChatGPT has now weighed in with a projection for where XRP might stand on October 31, 2025. Factors Influencing XRP in October ChatGPT noted that several factors are influencing XRP’s potential direction in October . On the positive side, upcoming decisions tied to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have the potential to attract institutional demand and provide greater market legitimacy. Analysts have highlighted the importance of support levels around $2.75 to $3.00, which could serve as a base if market optimism continues. On the other hand, risks remain. A strong rally ahead of official ETF decisions could lead to a “buy the rumor, sell the news” effect, where prices retrace once announcements are made. Broader crypto market conditions and macroeconomic developments could also influence XRP’s price trajectory. ChatGPT’s Price Range Forecast In the analysis, ChatGPT provided a projected range for XRP on October 31, 2025. The AI model stated: “Taking all factors into account, a plausible price range for XRP on October 31 would be between $2.50 and $4.50. If momentum and favorable developments align, XRP could test the higher end of that range, while weaker sentiment could see it closer to the lower bound.” This forecast highlights a balance between bullish drivers such as ETF momentum and institutional activity, and bearish risks including regulatory uncertainty and resistance levels around $3.20 to $3.50. The Role of AI in Crypto Forecasting The prediction underlines the growing interest in AI-driven forecasting in cryptocurrency markets. While traditional analysts rely on chart patterns, market data, and macroeconomic indicators, tools like ChatGPT add another dimension by synthesizing multiple perspectives into a consolidated outlook. Importantly, ChatGPT’s approach emphasizes probability rather than certainty, acknowledging the unpredictable nature of the market and the numerous variables that can impact short-term pricing. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What to Watch as October Progresses Market watchers have long debated XRP’s ability to break through significant resistance levels and establish itself above the $3 mark. Current trading data places the asset around $2.94, with intraday fluctuations showing both resilience and caution among investors. Technical analysts argue that holding above support at $2.75 could set the stage for further upward movement, as a failure to sustain momentum could open the door to corrections toward the lower end of ChatGPT’s predicted range. The coming weeks will be pivotal as October unfolds. ETF deadlines and regulatory updates are expected to play a defining role in shaping investor sentiment.

Speaking at a fireside chat at Token2049 in Singapore, he said that the process was phenomenal at the White House. “The President has built a team that can actually move at tech speed in order to do this.” He said that the US was clearly lagging behind in regulations. “We understand the need to move expeditiously, and I think that we acted on that,” said Bo, adding that it was tough for regulators, and they are still learning how these products actually work. Bo Hines recently stepped down as executive director of the White House Crypto Council to join private sector. He later joined stablecoin giant Tether as a Strategic Advisor for it’s new stablecoin, USAT, designed for the US market and complies with the US GENIUS Act . “Obviously, I am out of my government role now, I’d love to see the government set a standard in terms of what tech integration could look like,” Bo told Cody Carbone , CEO of the Digital Chamber, on Wednesday at the Singapore event. GENIUS Act Was Critical: It Was the “First Piece of the Puzzle” GENIUS Act, the stablecoin regulatory framework in the US, was passed within six months. Bo called it the “first piece of the puzzle.” “In order to have a completely renovated and revolutionized economic state, we had to start by updating the payment rails that existed, many of which were archaic.” He noted that there was a tremendous battle inside the system. There was a lot of conversations and healthy debates, he added. “I think at the point, the US will be the powerhouse in this space. Again, they will reestablish themselves and become the crypto capital, just as David and the President had outlined at the beginning of the process.” With regulations in place, banks would slowly integrate these technologies, Bo said. “Tech integrations are very simple, so banks are starting to figure it out.” America Wanted to Create the “Most Fair and Robust” Crypto Report: Bo Hines The White House has been working on the crypto report simultaneously with legislative priorities. The goal was to create “the most fair and robust standard that has ever been set from a government perspective,” Bo told Cody Carbone. “And how we did this is we set up an internal working group inside of the government, which included the SEC, CFTC treasury, commerce, all of the bank regulators, and we’d sit down with them on a weekly basis, saying that, let’s evaluate what the standard should be here, let’s talk about what market structure actually needs to include.” Currently, Patrick Woody is replacing Bo Hines in the White House as the executive director of the Council. “He’s working with the same folks that obviously helped build this comprehensive report,” Bo added. Talking about Tether’s new stablecoin USAT, he called it a “game changer.” “It’ll make business more expeditious, and that’s one thing that we’re working on over the course of the next couple of months. Is who our partner is going to be, who we want to collaborate with.” Bo believes that USAT will become an institutional product in the US, not only on the retail side. “We look forward to rolling out this product, and we hope that everyone engages with it.” The post Bo Hines Sheds Light on GENIUS Stablecoin Project, Calls it “First Piece of the Puzzle” appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|Bo Hines|GENIUS Act|Tether,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|USDT|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-02 08:06:35

Traditional whale-driven sell-offs are less effective as institutional investors hold for the long term and are less swayed by volatility. BTC's largest recent drawdown was only 30%, compared to 50% in 2021 and multiple 30% drops in 2017, highlighting increased resilience. Future Bitcoin volatility will be narrower, with higher price floors, as institutional investors reshape market dynamics and diminish the impact of whale sell-offs. Over the last several cycles of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), major price movement, especially on the downside, has been associated with some Bitcoin whales selling off their holdings in order to drive the price of Bitcoin down to take advantage of the lower price in order to take a new position in the foundational crypto. That has been rapidly changing, as publicly traded firms now have Bitcoin holdings of over 1 million BTC, and total institutional ownership now accounts for approximately 14% of all Bitcoin. That percentage is going to continue to expand in the years ahead. According to CryptoQuant , some of the largest holders of Bitcoin have participated in the largest selloff since 2022. Chart on Bitcoin whales selling of their reserves. (CryptoQuant) In this article we'll look primarily at the disruption of past Bitcoin cycles and what it means going forward. The Bitcoin whale strategy As briefly mentioned above, the past activity of Bitcoin whales (not hodlers) has been to start selling off when retail investors with a bad case of FOMO start to buy at or near the top of a cycle. At that time the whales start to sell off, and the price of Bitcoin has predictably plummeted by about 80 percent or so. Once that has happened, the whales of course start to buy up as retail investors panic sell into the weak Bitcoin price environment. While that has worked in the past, under the changing Bitcoin market the cycle has been disrupted, and the whales that have been selling off in big chunks lately are going to regret doing so, not understanding the changes in the crypto market. My thesis is long into the future we're unlikely to see the price of Bitcoin plunge by the percentages it has in the past, which if I'm correct, means that the whales that have been selling off may never see the cost basis in Bitcoin they had before they started selling. That of course doesn't mean there won't be periods of volatility in prices, but it does mean the spread between former price movements and the current Bitcoin price environment has contracted and aren't going to swing back and forth as they have in the past. The new Bitcoin market What has been gradually changing and emerging in the Bitcoin sector has been the increasing interest and investment from institutional investors. Since retail investors were the primary drivers of the past Bitcoin bull markets, the money would move in and out of the market in a heartbeat, which is why once the price started to quickly drop, it was like trying to catch a falling knife. The vast majority of institutional investors on the other hand, operate from a different mindset: they are in it for the long term, and don't, for the most part, make buy-and-sell decisions based upon FOMO because of price volatility on either side of the play. For example, in 2017 we saw Bitcoin trading at under $1,000 and soaring to almost $20,000, primarily from retail buyers taking positions. After the run-up, it pulled back to a bottom of approximately $3,200. In 2021, retail buyers pushed the price of Bitcoin from about $10,000 to up to $69,000. It eventually fell to close to $15,000. 5-year Bitcoin graph (Seeking Alpha) That started to change in early 2024, with Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high approximately a month before the last halving. In the past, Bitcoin never reached a new all-time high before the halving. After that happened, it traded sideways for a while before jumping to another all-time high in December of 2024. From that time Bitcoin hit its current all-time high of $124,500, and has since dropped to around $107,000, placing it at a similar level it traded in the latter part of 2024. The point in all of this is, the price of Bitcoin has held strong even though whales have been selling off billions in Bitcoin. What has changed? There is no doubt in my mind it's the positive consequence of institutional investors taking big positions in Bitcoin at big levels, which results in a much more stable price. So far in the current Bitcoin bull market the largest drop in price was 30% in April as a result of fears related to tariffs. In comparison, in 2017 we saw the price of Bitcoin fall by 30% numerous times, and in 2021 it fell as much as 50% during the bull market. Conclusion The Bitcoin price cycle has been permanently disrupted by increasing participation from institutional investors. Not only have they disrupted the past cycles, that were predictable, but it has disrupted the current cycle as well, with things like timeframe and tops and bottoms no longer based upon prior criteria, i.e., retail whales. In other words, we have no idea how Bitcoin is going to perform in the years ahead, aside from it's going to continue to go up in price, the floor is going to continue to climb, and the spread between tops and bottoms is going to contract. Again, that isn't meant to suggest a lack of volatility, only that volatility isn't going to be in as wide as swings because of institutional investors that aren't as prone to make emotion-driven investing decisions. The point of the article is to not base Bitcoin investing decisions based upon the recent sell-off from whales that are hoping to reproduce Bitcoin's past performance. Institutional investors have totally changed the game, and while we'll have some significant price swings, they're not going to be at the levels they have been in the past. Institutional investors are going to be more like retail hodlers that have held on for years, rather than those trying to drive the market by selling off large blocks of Bitcoin. That means there will be a more stable Bitcoin market now and, in the future, and those selling off in hopes of driving the price of Bitcoin down as in the past, are going to regret it as the price fails to drop to levels that would make it worthwhile. That doesn't include the tax liability associated with selling at a profit. The worst drawdown we’ve seen across this bull run was a 30% drop in April on the tariff fears. That’s it. In 2021, we dropped 50%, in a bull market. In 2017, we dropped 30% nine times. And even despite this recent drawdown, as of this writing, bitcoin is still up nearly 19% year to date. The major reason is directly related to the emerging impact of institutional investors on the Bitcoin market. One thing that is readily apparent is, the prior Bitcoin cycles have been disrupted, and new cycles are emerging which have yet to be made clear as to the price range Bitcoin will trade in and what the higher price floor will be.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-02 08:08:18

Over 2.2 million BTC held by companies and ETFs reduces available float and supports institutional positioning. New U.S. laws like the CLARITY Act and GENIUS Act have formalized institutional access and custody frameworks. Bitcoin market cap hits $2.34T, surpassing Amazon as institutional ETFs and corporate treasuries lock over 2.2M BTC—read analysis, regulatory outlook, and portfolio implications. Bitcoin surpasses Amazon in valuation as institutional ETFs, regulation and portfolio shifts drive deeper market integration. Bitcoin’s 0.87 correlation with major stock indices shows investors treat it as part of the broader risk asset class. Over 2.2 million BTC held by companies and ETFs is limiting supply, supporting long term institutional positioning. New U.S. legislation like the CLARITY and GENIUS Acts is accelerating regulated adoption across global financial channels. Bitcoin has surpassed Amazon in market capitalization, reaching approximately $2.34 trillion in early October 2025. This places the crypto among the world’s seven largest assets, alongside gold, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, and silver. What is the significance of Bitcoin’s new market cap? Bitcoin market cap at ~$2.34 trillion marks a structural shift: institutional custody and spot ETF inflows have tightened available supply and elevated Bitcoin into the same valuation conversation as large-cap equities. This validates evolving use in diversified portfolios and institutional treasuries. How have institutional holdings changed Bitcoin’s supply dynamics? Institutional adoption has materially reduced on-chain liquidity. Disclosures show roughly 265 public and private companies holding a combined 853,000 BTC—about 4% of circulating supply. Spot Bitcoin ETFs custody another estimated 1.4 million BTC, totaling over 2.2 million BTC held off-market. These reserves act as long-term stores rather than tradable float, creating structural scarcity consistent with Bitcoin’s fixed 21 million supply cap. How does rising correlation with equities affect portfolio construction? Bitcoin’s rolling correlation with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose to 0.87 as of January 2025. That elevated linkage means advisors now model Bitcoin within traditional risk frameworks rather than treating it purely as a speculative alternative. Practical implications include: rebalancing triggers tied to equity volatility, volatility budgeting across risk-parity models, and clearer policy guidance for fiduciaries considering crypto allocations. Why does regulation matter for mainstream adoption? Recent U.S. legislation—referred to as the CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act in legislative texts—has provided defined custody, reporting, and compliance pathways for institutional managers. This reduces operational friction for pension funds, sovereign investors, and registered advisers. Policy clarity has been cited by market participants and legal advisors as a key enabler of the ETF inflows powering Bitcoin’s valuation advance. (Sources: official legislative texts and public company filings—mentioned here as plain text references.) When might Bitcoin challenge other large-cap benchmarks? With Amazon now ranked below Bitcoin by market cap, attention turns to Apple and Microsoft as the next benchmarks. Continued ETF growth, corporate treasury allocations, and stable regulatory frameworks will determine whether Bitcoin closes valuation gaps with productivity-based equities. Frequently Asked Questions How much BTC do institutions and ETFs hold collectively? Institutions (public and private companies) disclose roughly 853,000 BTC, while spot ETFs custody about 1.4 million BTC—over 2.2 million BTC combined, representing a significant portion of circulating supply held long term. Does a high correlation with stocks make Bitcoin less attractive as a diversifier? Higher correlation reduces pure diversification benefits during equity rallies, but Bitcoin’s unique scarcity profile and non-sovereign properties maintain its role as a differentiated allocation within strategic portfolios. Key Takeaways Valuation milestone : Bitcoin at ~$2.34T now ranks above Amazon, reflecting institutional acceptance. Supply tightness : Over 2.2M BTC held by companies and ETFs reduces available float and supports long-term positioning. Regulatory clarity : New U.S. legislation has accelerated institutional access, custody standards, and reporting norms. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise to a roughly $2.34 trillion market cap signals deeper integration into mainstream finance, driven by spot ETF inflows, corporate treasuries and clearer regulation.

Avalanche Network DEX Transactions Hit 3-Year High: $17.4 Billion in September According to a statement released by the platform's official X account, the trading volume of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the Avalanche network reached $17.4 billion in September. This figure marked the highest monthly trading volume recorded on the network in the last three years. Experts attribute this increase to both a renewed appetite for risk in global markets and the impact of new DeFi protocols being developed within the Avalanche ecosystem. Liquidity mining campaigns, user base expansion, and transaction speed improvements are cited as key drivers supporting DEX volumes. Avalanche, a Layer-1 blockchain characterized by high transaction capacity and low latency, has recently become an attractive infrastructure for DeFi projects. Its $17.4 billion transaction volume is considered an indicator not only of investor interest but also of the ecosystem's growing use cases. Analysts emphasize that if this trend continues, Avalanche could become one of the strongest DeFi hubs outside of Ethereum. However, they note that market fluctuations and global regulatory developments will continue to play a significant role in determining the ecosystem. *This is not investment advice.

Social media security is not the same as… https://t.co/rVYK1NRguz — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 1, 2025 He reassured the community that the situation was under control: “X account restored. Hacker got $13k. Security team(s) still tracking, with a possible linked KYC. Hacker went through all these trouble, plus criminal liability. He could have made more by building. Victims will be compensated in full.” CZ also thanked the community for quickly spreading warnings, which helped minimize losses. His message was clear, while the attacker succeeded in tricking a handful of users, most of the BNB ecosystem stayed alert. Official BNB Chain Update Shortly after, BNB Chain’s team issued a formal update titled “Update on Account Security Incident.” In their post, the team confirmed they had regained full access to the account and were investigating the breach’s root cause. They promised to share more findings once available and committed to transparency throughout the process. The update included a detailed breakdown: 10 phishing links were posted during the hack. Roughly $8,000 was stolen across all chains. The biggest victim lost $6,500 in one transaction. A phishing contract address was deployed. The attacker injected $17,800, then exited their meme tokens for $22,000. BNB Chain added that all victims would be fully compensated and ended their message with a note of gratitude to the community: “A massive thank you to our community and partners for spreading the word quickly, staying vigilant & supportive throughout this incident. We are committed to transparency and will continue to prioritise security to prevent future incidents. Stay SAFU.” Small Loss, Big Lesson On the surface, $13K in stolen funds may not seem catastrophic. For a blockchain ecosystem that secures billions in value, the figure is tiny. However, the incident highlights an often overlooked risk: social media hacks. Update on Account Security Incident We’re back! The team has regained full access of the @BNBCHAIN account. The root cause of this breach is still under active investigation and we will share the updates as soon as we can. The estimated damage is $8K and the victims will be… — BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) October 1, 2025 Unlike direct protocol exploits, these attacks prey on human trust. Users see official accounts as credible, making phishing links disguised as “airdrops” or “updates” especially dangerous. CZ emphasized this point: “Social media security is not the same as crypto platform security. Glad most of our community was immune to these attempts.” This gap between platform-level safety and communication-level safety is becoming more relevant as Web3 projects rely on X and Telegram for real-time engagement. Why This Hack Matters Even though the attacker gained little, the hack raises several important issues: 1. Trust in Communication Channels Users need to verify announcements across multiple sources. Blindly trusting one X post, even from an official account, can result in losses. 2. Community Defense Works The speed at which users flagged and reshared warnings played a key role in limiting damage. Community-led defense remains a critical layer of security in crypto. 3. KYC Can Be a Double-Edged Sword Ironically, the hacker routed the funds through a centralized, KYC-based exchange. This made it easier for investigators to freeze the funds. The move shows how attackers sometimes underestimate the traceability of their actions. 4. Psychological Exploits vs. Technical Exploits Most blockchain users are familiar with smart contract risks. But phishing exploits rely on psychology, urgency, greed, or trust in authority. This is harder to defend with code alone. Market Context: BNB in Focus Despite the breach, BNB (BNB), the native token of BNB Chain, showed no significant price swings. As of today, BNB trades at $1020.12, up 2% in the last 24 hours (CoinMarketCap). The calm response suggests the market viewed this as a contained social media incident rather than a reflection of deeper systemic risk. For investors, the event serves as a reminder that token price often depends more on network fundamentals than on external communication breaches. BNB Chain’s quick response and pledge to compensate victims will likely help restore confidence. Unlike other crypto incidents where victims bear the losses, this proactive step highlights a commitment to community protection. Transparency will also play a key role going forward. By publishing post-mortems, sharing findings on how the hack occurred, and tightening security protocols, BNB Chain can turn a moment of weakness into an opportunity to strengthen trust. Community’s Role in Security The most striking part of this incident may not be the hack itself, but the community’s rapid reaction. Within minutes, warnings were circulating across X, Telegram, and Discord. Many users recognized the phishing links for what they were and flagged them immediately. This shows a cultural shift. In the early years of crypto, phishing links often caused widespread damage. Today, with more experienced users and heightened awareness, attackers face a tougher environment. The BNB Chain hack on X may have been small in monetary value, but it carries a larger warning. Crypto platforms aren’t just judged on their blockchain security anymore. They must also secure their communication channels, because that’s where users make real-time decisions. With losses capped at $13K, funds frozen at a KYC exchange, and victims promised full compensation, this incident is more of a lesson than a disaster. BNB Chain, CZ, and the community showed resilience in the face of an attack. And while the hacker ended up with little, the episode reinforced one key truth for crypto users everywhere: stay vigilant, verify links, and remember that trust is the first line of defense.

With short-term indicators signalling an overbought condition, this would be a good time for a short pull-back and retest of the breakout. A major rally could then take place. $BTC breaks out of descending channel Source: TradingView As can be seen on the above 8-hour chart, the $BTC price has been traversing within a descending channel, from which it broke out on Wednesday. Descending channels are bullish formations so it would be expected that the price will carry on up to the all-time high and beyond. A measured move of the channel breakout would take the price to around $130,000. Nevertheless, when a breakout occurs from such a pattern, technical analysis tells us that the price will usually return to the breakout zone in order to test and confirm it before rising again. In the chart above it can be observed that a small red candle has formed, which might be the first sign that a corrective impulse is inbound. All the shorter term time frame Stochastic RSI indicators, up to the 12-hour, are at their tops, and so a period of consolidation would be healthy here in order to allow them to reset to a lower level. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at the bottom of the chart has its indicator line just inside overbought territory so it would also be good for this to come back down somewhat. Given the slightly overextended nature of this current move, it may well be that the price could even reenter the channel. If it does so, the $113,000 horizontal support level could potentially be a good base for a bounce. As long as the bulls prevent the price going below $109,000 and making a lower low, a rally to new all-time highs is still the more likely scenario. Death cross confirmed in daily time frame Source: TradingView In the daily chart it can be seen that the death cross (50-day SMA crossing below the 100-day SMA) has now taken place. However, with the price action holding support at the 50-day SMA and well above it, a cross-back may not be too far off. The Stochastic RSI indicators in the daily time frame are still signalling upside momentum but this may not be for too much longer. At the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) could witness the indicator line turning back down to test and confirm the trendline breakout. Weekly chart shifts bullish Source: TradingView The weekly chart has become far more bullish, and that has only happened in the course of the last couple of weeks. Last week, the $BTC price came all the way back down to retest the $109,000 horizontal support level, and from there the price has surged more than $10,000. As mentioned earlier, the price broke through the descending channel and has managed to just touch the last major resistance at $119,500. A pullback to the top of the channel, followed by a surge into next week, could spark the beginnings of the next leg higher. The Stochastic RSI indicators have changed from a certain-looking cross down at the start of the week, to the blue indicator line getting back above the orange line, while the MACD is starting to show that the blue indicator line could be moving back up to cross above the orange signal line. All appears to be set for Bitcoin to make its next big move. However, it must be borne in mind that a corrective impulse could occur over the next day or two.

Here Are All the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/robinhood-ceo-reveals-major-developments-ahead-of-global-markets-by-2030-here-are-all-the-details/,"Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said at the Token2049 conference in Singapore that regulatory frameworks for asset tokenization could be implemented in most major financial markets within the next five years. Robinhood CEO: Tokenization Framework Will Be Established in Global Markets by 2030 “Tokenization is like a freight train; it is unstoppable and will eventually transform the entire financial system,” Tenev said. According to Tenev, full global adoption of tokenization could take up to a decade. However, he noted that the US will likely transition more slowly than other regions due to its existing financial infrastructure's effectiveness. Referring to Japan's high-speed rail system, Tenev said, “If it's too costly to reduce a three-hour journey to two hours, the current system is considered functional. The same goes for the U.S. financial system.” Tenev, describing stablecoins as the most fundamental example of tokenized assets, emphasized that dollar-based stablecoins have reinforced the US's global monetary dominance and that a similar trend will spread to tokenized stocks, real estate, and other assets. He believes that in the future, the line between crypto technology and traditional finance will completely disappear. Another area of focus for Robinhood has been prediction markets. The platform, which the company launched in late 2024, has traded more than 4 billion contracts to date. Tenev noted that contracts related to sports, culture, artificial intelligence, and elections are gaining prominence, adding that this market isn't limited to election periods. Robinhood has reportedly begun discussions with foreign regulators, including the UK's FCA, to expand its service globally. *This is not investment advice.

The longtime crypto trader and former BitMEX CEO used his “Bastille Day” essay to accuse ECB chief Christine Lagarde of being a “crocodilian ex-con countess” and a “criminal” running monetary policy from Frankfurt. Arthur urged Europeans to dump the euro and convert their savings into Bitcoin, warning that France’s finances are collapsing and the ECB will eventually unleash trillions in new money. He compared France’s current crisis to the monarchy’s downfall after financing American independence, saying the same boomerang effect is now hitting the Fifth Republic. Arthur wrote that France is too indebted, its savers are fleeing, and the euro is doomed. According to him, the ECB will be forced to print, and Bitcoin will be the winner. Arthur called the euro “an absolute stinking piece of sh*t” and “an abomination created to stifle local culture.” He said past predictions of collapse during the 2011–2012 crisis failed because Germany and France printed together, but this time, Germany and France are pulling in opposite directions. TARGET balances from January 2020 show France moving from surplus to the largest deficit in the eurozone, a sign that French savers are moving funds to safer systems in Germany and Luxembourg. “If the second-largest economy in the euro with the largest debt load is experiencing a bank walk, it doesn’t bode well for the future of the common currency,” he wrote. Arthur points to France’s debt and ECB printing plans Arthur argued that France is trapped, as US foreign policy changes mean German and Japanese capital will no longer fund France’s deficits. He reminded readers that after WWII, America tolerated ex-Nazis and Japanese imperialists in power as long as their countries remained bulwarks against communism. With US support, Germany and Japan rebuilt industries, protected their markets, and exported to America. That history left them with massive wealth: Germany’s net portfolio balance stands at $4.968 trillion, Japan’s at $4.446 trillion. By contrast, France runs a deficit of 38% of GDP, second only to the US. He wrote that as America shifts to “America-first” industrial policy under Donald Trump, Germany and Japan will repatriate capital to fund domestic industries. Arthur quoted Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing promoting a “Made for Germany” agenda and cited Sanae Takaichi of Japan pushing “Japan First” policies. That, he said, leaves France exposed: 59% of its OAT bonds and 70% of its long-term bank debt are foreign-owned, largely by Germany and Japan. With no foreign checkbooks left, Arthur said France must either default or rely on the ECB’s printing press, calculating that saving EU banks from French liabilities would require €5.02 trillion. Arthur then pointed to Macron’s failed attempts to pass a budget and quoted French leftist leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who said: “The 3000 billion in debt is not ours. It belongs to foreign investors at 60%. Let them be cautious with the French.” Arthur warns of capital flight, controls, and Bitcoin surge Arthur predicted that French savers will see their euros re-denominated into a weaker franc. He said a weaker franc would help exports and tourism but would crush savings. Both left and right resent ECB control, he wrote, making a French exit from the euro inevitable. He pointed out July 2025 deposits at €2.6 trillion and estimated €650 billion could flee before controls are imposed. He calculated that $1.68 trillion in French equities and bonds could be sold, with $1.15 trillion escaping quickly at current FX rates, and Arthur thinks those trillions would rush into Bitcoin and gold . Arthur described the chain reaction like this: So once France imposes controls, other euro members will defy Frankfurt and Brussels, and Germany’s decision will decide the euro’s fate, but investors will dump euro assets regardless, creating a “risk-off” event that crashes EU stocks and bonds. The EuroStoxx 50 and EuroAgg Bond Index have already been underperforming against Bitcoin and gold since 2021, causing Arthur to mock Europe for buying expensive American gas over cheaper Russian supply and said investors should “just get the f*ck out.” “Bitcoin doesn’t care and will continue its inexorable rise versus the piece of trash that is the euro,” he wrote. He warned that EU regulators will close exits, so Europeans must move savings into Bitcoin now. Arthur ended his essay by saying the collapse will be so large that those who cash out early may flaunt riches at Bastille Day parties, “light capital on fire by purchasing a Nebuchadnezzar of bubbly water and fist pump to Rufus in the middle of the afternoon.” Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",News|BTC|ECB|EUR|Gold,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|BTC|FIAT|ASIA,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-02 08:54:17

Our journey so far: SMA vs EMA for trend direction MACD for momentum shifts RSI for overbought/oversold zones Bollinger Bands for volatility and price extremes Stochastic Oscillator for timing reversals VWAP for fair price detection Volume + OBV for spotting smart money flow ATR for volatility-based risk management Today, we’re exploring Fibonacci retracements, the mathematical tool that reveals where markets are most likely to find support and resistance. The Mathematical Foundation The Fibonacci sequence is a simple pattern where each number is the sum of the two before it (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13…). What makes it fascinating is the ratio between these numbers. As the sequence grows, the ratio stabilises around 1.618 , also known as the Golden Ratio . This ratio shows up everywhere in the natural world : The spiral of seashells and galaxies The way leaves grow around a stem The proportions of the human body The branching of trees and rivers In trading, we convert these mathematical relationships into retracement percentages. The key Fibonacci ratios are derived from the Golden Ratio (1.618): 61.8% = 1 ÷ 1.618 (the inverse of the Golden Ratio) 38.2% = 1 – 61.8% 23.6% = 38.2% × 61.8% 78.6% = the square root of 61.8% Why this matters for trading: These aren’t arbitrary numbers – they’re mathematical relationships that appear throughout nature. When applied to price movements, they often mark where buying and selling pressure naturally shifts. 61.8% : The golden ratio. The most powerful retracement, where major bounces often happen. Institutional traders monitor this level closely as it represents the mathematical “decision point” for trend continuation. 38.2% : A common correction level where price temporarily pauses before resuming the primary trend. 23.6% : Indicates strong underlying momentum. Robust trends rarely retrace beyond this level before continuing. 78.6% : Represents the “last stand” for trend continuation. Breaks below this level typically signal impending trend reversal. Setting Up Fibonacci Retracement on Bitfinex Fibonacci retracements identify potential reversal levels during market corrections. Here’s the process: Identify the trend: Open trading.bitfinex.com and select your trading pair. On the left toolbar, look for the “Fib Retracement” tool (it looks like 4 horizontal lines) Spot a clear move on the chart – either a rally (low to high) or a drop (high to low). Find your swing points: Swing Low: The obvious lowest point where price bottomed out before moving up Swing High: The obvious highest point where price peaked before moving down Tip: Zoom out to see the bigger picture – you want the most obvious turning points, not small bumps Apply the tool: Uptrend: Click the swing low, drag to the swing high Downtrend: Click the swing high, drag to the swing low Watch the levels: The tool automatically plots retracement lines (23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6%). These act as potential support and resistance zones. Plan your trades: Traders use these levels to time entries, set profit targets, and place stop losses. The psychology behind it: Markets move in waves due to human emotions, fear and greed create predictable patterns, and Fibonacci levels often line up with where traders collectively step in or take profit. Real Example: BTC/USD Analysis Swing low: $98,514 (22 Jun) Swing high: $123,702 (8 Sep) Range: ~$25,188 Calculated retracements: 23.6% – $117,757 38.2% – $114,080 50% – $111,108 61.8% – $108,136 78.6% – $103,904 Current price: $117,830 Notice how BTC retraced deeply from its September high, testing the critical 61.8% “Golden Ratio” level around $108,136. This demonstrates the power of Fibonacci retracements – the 61.8% level acted as strong support and generated a significant bounce. This is classic Fibonacci behavior where the Golden Ratio level provides a high-probability reversal zone, allowing the trend to continue after testing this mathematically significant support level. Advanced Fibonacci Strategies 1. Multiple Timeframe Analysis Apply Fibonacci on different timeframes for confluence: Daily chart: Major swing points for position trading 4-hour chart: Intermediate levels for swing trading 1-hour chart: Fine-tune entries for day trading 2. Fibonacci Confluence Zones The most powerful setups occur when multiple factors align: Fibonacci level + horizontal support/resistance Fibonacci level + moving average Fibonacci level + trend line Multiple Fibonacci levels from different swings 3. Extension Projections Once price breaks past the previous high or low, Fibonacci isn’t just about pullbacks, it can also project where the move might go next . Traders often watch: 100% – Equal to the last swing. 127.2% – First extension target. 161.8% – The “golden target,” where many trends pause. 200%+ – Aggressive moves in strong trends. 4. Fibonacci + Other Indicators Fibonacci + RSI : RSI oversold at key Fib level = high-probability bounce. For example, RSI below 30 at 61.8% retracement often marks significant lows. Wait for RSI to turn up from oversold at Fib support Fibonacci + ATR Use ATR to set stops beyond Fibonacci levels. For example, If 61.8% level is $96,460 and ATR is $3,000, place stop at $93,460. ATR ensures your stop accounts for normal volatility Fibonacci + Volume High volume at Fib levels confirms significance. For example, Volume spike + bounce at 61.8% = strong reversal signal. High volume break of 78.6% suggests trend change Fibonacci + MACD MACD divergence at Fibonacci levels creates powerful reversal setups. Your entry trigger comes when the MACD line crosses above its signal line while price holds Fibonacci support. Bonus Read: Fibonacci + RSI in Action Looking at this BTC daily chart, we can see the 61.8% “Golden Ratio” level at $108,064 acting as major support. When BTC retraced from its highs down to this critical Fibonacci level, it found strong buying interest and bounced significantly. BTC rallied from this mathematical support level back above $117,000, demonstrating how the 61.8% retracement often marks important turning points. The current RSI reading of 62.20 shows healthy momentum has returned after the recovery. The next key level to watch is the 23.6% retracement at $117,677. A break above with rising RSI could signal continuation toward new highs. However, if RSI starts diverging negatively while price struggles at this level, it might indicate another test of deeper Fibonacci support is coming. Common Fibonacci Mistakes to Avoid Swing Point Slip-Ups Don’t use tiny highs and lows. They give messy signals. Stick to clear, obvious swing points that show up on multiple timeframes. Fighting the Trend One Fib line won’t overturn the bigger picture. Always trade in the direction of the larger trend, not against it. Jumping In Too Fast Don’t buy the second price touches a level. Wait for confirmation: candlestick patterns, volume, or momentum indicators. Trusting Fibs Blindly Not every level holds. Use stops and look for confluence with moving averages or other Fibonacci levels. Ignoring Context Consider news, economic data, and market sentiment alongside your Fibonacci analysis. Fibonacci Limitations Subjectivity: Different analysts may select varying swing points, leading to slightly different level calculations. Market Conditions: Fibonacci analysis performs optimally in trending markets but may provide false signals during choppy, sideways price action. Historical Basis: These tools analyse past price movements rather than predict future price action with certainty. False Signals: Market conditions can change rapidly, causing price to break through expected support or resistance levels.

Coinbase’s David Duong also explained at Token2049 that mergers, acquisitions, and crypto-native yield strategies will define the next phase as firms compete to dominate tokens. Despite skepticism over share buybacks, DATs continue to accumulate massive Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings. Crypto Treasuries Look Like Hype Not Bubble At the Token2049 conference in Singapore, TON Strategy CEO Veronika Kapustina shared her perspective on the booming corporate digital asset treasury (DAT) sector, which quickly became one of the hottest trends in both crypto and traditional finance. Kapustina acknowledged that the surge in DATs has all the signs of a bubble, but also pointed out that it differs from previous financial bubbles because it represents an entirely new segment of the financial system. She explained that digital asset treasuries became “the trade of the summer,” by attracting fast money and speculative investors, but now the market is maturing with more sophisticated participants carefully separating quality projects from unsustainable ones. Kapustina described digital asset treasuries as a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto economy, with long-term potential that goes well beyond the hype cycle. While she does not expect a crash, she does expect a period of consolidation as many newly launched treasuries struggle to reach their ambitious goals. This natural cooling off period, she argued, will pave the way for medium- to long-term capital to flow in. This will build a more sustainable foundation for the sector. Kapustina also credited Michael Saylor’s Strategy with pioneering the DAT model by adopting Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset. Since then, the model expanded to include other leading cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Solana, and Toncoin, the native token of The Open Network. Kapustina believes this evolution proves that the concept works across multiple blockchain ecosystems, and she outlined possible future paths for DATs, including providing financial infrastructure, pursuing banking licenses, enabling mergers and acquisitions, and serving as technology bridges between chains. Despite the concerns about overheated valuations, corporate crypto treasuries continued to accumulate assets aggressively throughout the year. Data shows that more than 1.3 million Bitcoin, which is worth close to $158 billion, are currently held in corporate treasuries. BTC in treasuries (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) Similarly, Ethereum treasuries secured around 5.5 million ETH valued at $24 billion, representing 4.5% of its total supply. Kapustina believes that in the long run, investors will recognize the true value of DATs not only as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto, but also for their role in securing networks and supporting blockchain utility. Digital Asset Treasuries Enter Next Phase The digital asset treasury sector is entering a new stage of maturity. This is according to Coinbase’s head of investment research, David Duong . At Token2049, Duong suggested that mergers and acquisitions could become a dominant theme as companies look for ways to stand out and secure investor confidence. He pointed to the recent all-stock deal in which Bitcoin treasury firm Strive acquired fellow digital asset treasury Semler Scientific as an early sign of this trend. Duong explained that while many DATs initially focused on share price strategies, the market is now seeing a push toward more crypto-native approaches like staking and DeFi looping, where assets are repeatedly borrowed and repositioned to maximize yield. However, he also pointed out that the sector’s long-term trajectory will depend heavily on regulatory clarity, liquidity conditions, and market forces. Standard Chartered predicted in mid-September that not all treasuries will survive, which will force weaker players either to adapt or disappear. The competitive nature of the market already pushed DATs into what Duong described as a player-vs-player phase, where companies attempt to dominate individual tokens. This led to aggressive share buybacks that are aimed at boosting stock prices and signaling strength to investors. Some of the more recent moves included Trump Jr.-linked Thumzup increasing its buyback program from $1 million to $10 million, and Solana-focused DeFi Development Corp expanding its plan from $1 million to $100 million. Duong suggested that the underlying motivation is the belief that only a handful of treasuries will ultimately emerge as leaders for each major token, whether it be Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana. Still, share buybacks have not always produced the desired effect. Duong warned that these programs are highly sentiment-driven and can be perceived as a defensive maneuver rather than a show of strength. For example, TON Strategy Company, formerly Verb Technology, announced a buyback in September. After this, its shares dropped 7.5% as investors questioned the company’s long-term strategy. Despite these challenges, digital asset treasuries continue to accumulate holdings.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|BTC|BUSINESS|TON,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-02 09:00:00

52557487,595439,1759395619,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52557487.jpeg,Solana Corporate Playbook Expands With VisionSys AI’s $2 Billion SOL Treasury Plan,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-corporate-visionsys-2-billion-sol-treasury/,"NASDAQ-listed VisionSys AI today announced that its subsidiary, Medintel Technology Inc., has signed an exclusive partnership with staking protocol Marinade Finance to launch a Solana-based (SOL) digital treasury program, valued at up to $2 billion. Solana Corporate Adoption Gains Momentum According to an announcement earlier today, VisionSys AI – a technology services firm specializing in brain-machine interaction and advanced AI systems – stated that its subsidiary is set to acquire and stake $500 million worth of SOL in the next six months. In the announcement, VisionSys AI stated that the partnership is aimed toward strengthening the firm’s balance sheet, enhancing liquidity, and creating long-term strategic value through SOL acquisition. Notably, Marinade Finance, a leading player in the Solana decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, will function as VisionSys AI’s exclusive staking and ecosystem partner. Commenting on the development, Heng Wang, CEO of VisionSys AI, stated: This partnership represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to integrate digital assets into our corporate DNA. It positions VisionSys as a pioneer of AI-driven blockchain treasury management. By leveraging Marinade’s unparalleled expertise, we are not just strengthening our treasury; we are building a foundation for the future. While the firm will start with buying and staking $500 million worth of SOL, it eventually plans to scale up and create a treasury worth $2 billion of SOL. That said, the announcement makes no mention of how VisionSys AI plans to buy SOL. Assuming the firm can bag $500 million worth of SOL, then it would instantly find itself among the top five leading public firms with the largest Solana-based treasuries. Currently, the medical design firm Forward Industries holds the largest SOL treasury, worth $1.5 billion. Meanwhile, DeFi protocol Marinade Finance currently holds more than 10.4 million SOL tokens, worth approximately $2.2 billion according to current market prices. According to data from Coingecko, the protocol’s native token, MRND, is up 11.6% in the past 24 hours, trading at $0.14. On the contrary, VisionSys AI’s stock plummeted following today’s announcement. The stock is down a massive 35.17% in the past 24 hours, trading at $2.23 at the time of writing. However, it is up an impressive 462% over the last six months. Where Is SOL Headed? As corporate adoption of SOL continues at a rapid pace, analysts are not shying away from giving predictions about the digital asset’s price movement. Chinese AI tool DeepSeek recently forecasted that SOL could surge past $450 by the end of 2025. Solana is also taking the spotlight from the two leading cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), as SOL-based crypto investment products recently attracted inflows to the tune of $291 million. At press time, SOL trades at $219.19, up 6.7% in the past 24 hours.",Solana|Altcoin|Cryptocurrency|DeFi|marinade finance|Medintel Technology|SOL|solana|solana treasury adoption|SOLUSDT|VisionSys AI,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-02 09:00:19

Together with Backed, Kraken are today partnering with Wallet in Telegram, a digital asset solution natively embedded into the Telegram app, to bring xStocks to one of the largest consumer platforms in the world. Bringing tokenized equities to Telegram Eligible Telegram users will soon be able to access a range of xStocks assets directly within Wallet in Telegram, its custodial crypto wallet. The partnership doesn’t stop there. Over the coming months, Kraken, Backed and the Wallet in Telegram team will also extend the xStocks rollout to include Telegram’s self-custodial TON wallet, built on the TON blockchain. This marks a major milestone for the growth of xStocks – driving our mission to bring tokenized equities to mass audiences, no matter which blockchain or consumer application they use. Millions of Telegram users will be able to seamlessly interact with tokenized equities right alongside the crypto assets they already use every day in the Wallet in Telegram offering. Unlocking new opportunities on TON Beyond access, this integration unlocks new possibilities for developers and users on the TON blockchain. xStocks can soon be leveraged as collateral for DeFi protocols and Web3 mini apps, opening the door to an entirely new wave of adoption and innovation across TON’s ecosystem. Arjun Sethi, Kraken co-CEO: “Bringing xStocks into Wallet in Telegram is about meeting people where they already are. Hundreds of millions use Telegram every day, and now they can access tokenized equities directly inside one of the most familiar apps in the world.” “This is not about convenience alone. It is about collapsing the distance between traditional markets and everyday users. It shows that investing can be seamless, borderless, and available around the clock, just like the way we already communicate online.” Andrew Rogozov, Founder and CEO of The Open Platform (TOP) and Wallet in Telegram: “By bringing tokenized equities into Telegram, we’re shattering the traditional walls of finance and giving millions of people their first real shot at the global financial arena. With xStocks, now Telegram users can access exposure to leading U.S. companies right where they chat, pay, and use digital services.” “Our mission is simple – make tokenized stocks and ETFs available to 1 billion Telegram users across every corner of the world, turning everyday conversations into opportunities to participate in global markets.” Adam Levi, Backed co-Founder: “With xStocks, we’re doing more than tokenizing equities into the blockchain, we’re fundamentally changing the way users interact with capital markets and build wealth.” “Developers are building solutions that would simply not be possible on TradFi rails, and to be able to access these opportunities from one of the most popular messengers in the world is a game-changer. The upcoming TON deployment will boost this even further, as a new ecosystem joins the fold.” As with all xStocks integrations, the tokens issued by Backed remain fully collateralized 1:1 with underlying equities, ensuring transparency and trust for Wallet in Telegram’s global user base. What’s next for xStocks xStocks has already surpassed $4.5 billion in combined CEX and DEX trading volume since launch, reflecting strong demand for tokenized equities that can operate across a range of blockchains, platforms, and consumer applications. In just the past three months, we’ve launched xStocks on Solana and announced integrations with BNB Chain, TRON, Ethereum, and now the TON ecosystem. This cross-chain, multi-platform strategy underpins the mission of xStocks: tokenized equities must be open, borderless, permissionless, chain-neutral, and accessible worldwide — wherever users choose to build and trade. Together with key strategic partners like Wallet in Telegram and others, we’ll keep building until tokenized equities, specifically xStocks, become a mainstream reality for billions of users worldwide.

Why Funds Are Eyeing XRP ETFs,https://timestabloid.com/wall-streets-next-big-bet-why-funds-are-eyeing-xrp-etfs/,"The entry of Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) into US markets has already transformed institutional exposure to crypto, drawing billions of dollars from investors seeking regulated access. Now attention is turning toward XRP, a digital asset that has long been dismissed as an outsider but is increasingly viewed by some asset managers as a potential surprise contender. Despite its history of legal battles with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and a brand presence that does not match Bitcoin or Ether, XRP is attracting fresh interest. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, believes current skepticism may be misplaced. He noted that “people are severely underestimating investor demand for spot xrp & sol ETFs,” adding that the same doubts existed when Bitcoin and Ether ETFs were first proposed. You heard it here first… People are severely underestimating investor demand for spot xrp & sol ETFs. Just like they did w/ spot btc & eth ETFs. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) September 1, 2025 The Growing Wave of XRP ETF Filings There are many XRP ETF applications before the SEC. Currently, seven filings are under SEC review, just behind Solana with eight. In total, there are 92 active crypto-related proposals. The applicant pool includes established firms such as WisdomTree, Grayscale, Franklin, and Canary Capital, alongside newer players experimenting with more complex structures. Some of these proposals go beyond simple price tracking. Amplify, for instance, has put forward a design that combines XRP exposure with covered call strategies, aiming to generate yield. Others, like 21Shares and Bitwise, have repeatedly updated their filings, signaling confidence in eventual approval. This level of innovation and persistence has helped elevate XRP into the broader ETF debate. A Crucial October for XRP The SEC is preparing to decide on several key spot XRP ETF applications in October 2025. Between October 18 and October 25, rulings are scheduled for six major filings, including those from Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, Canary, WisdomTree, and CoinShares. In parallel, Ripple’s application for a national bank charter with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is expected to be decided in the same timeframe. If approved, Ripple would gain the ability to operate as a federally supervised financial institution, expanding into regulated payments, custody, and services. Analysts argue that the combination of ETF approval and a bank charter would institutionalize XRP’s role both as an investable asset and a functional part of the financial system. Why Investors See XRP Differently XRP’s growing case as Wall Street’s “dark horse” rests on emerging signs of demand. CME XRP futures have already reached more than $1 billion in open interest, marking the fastest growth among crypto derivatives contracts. Canary Capital has forecast as much as $5 billion in initial demand for an ETF, while JPMorgan analysts suggest annual inflows could approach $8 billion. Evidence of investor readiness is already visible. Nearly $380 million has flowed into XRP-related exchange-traded products, demonstrating that capital is positioned to move quickly should spot ETFs receive approval. At the same time, institutional wallets have accumulated close to $928 million worth of XRP, reinforcing the impression that large investors are preparing for significant regulatory shifts. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Persistent Risks and Divided Opinions Not all market participants share the optimism. BlackRock has explicitly stated it will not pursue a US spot XRP ETF due to limited client demand and continuing regulatory uncertainty. Some strategists warn that an XRP ETF could fail to sustain inflows or produce consistent returns, with one even describing the launch as potentially marking “the beginning of the end.” October’s outcomes—both on ETF filings and Ripple’s bank charter bid—will likely define XRP’s trajectory for years to come. A favorable ruling on both fronts could accelerate institutional adoption and position XRP as one of the few digital assets with both market legitimacy and operational integration. Partial approval would still offer momentum, though without the same transformative effect. A full rejection, however, would risk sidelining XRP in the US market until regulatory clarity improves. For now, the token’s role as Wall Street’s unexpected contender remains intact. Whether it delivers on that potential depends on the decisions regulators make in the coming weeks.

In just 24 hours, the token added $8 billion to its market capitalization, climbing from $170.8 billion to $178.8 billion. XRP price followed suit, advancing nearly 3% to $2.98. XRP 1-day market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap The activity beneath the headline figure is even more telling. Daily trading volume surged 21% to $6.5 billion, giving XRP one of the highest turnover rates among major-cap cryptocurrencies. With a circulating supply of 59.87 billion tokens, that level of liquidity points to decisive whale accumulation. On-chain analyst Ali Martinez noted that whales purchased 250 million XRP in just 48 hours, reinforcing the view that institutional-sized wallets are driving the move. 250 million $XRP bought by whales in 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/S0DZYQms7i — Ali (@ali_charts) October 1, 2025 XRP institutional lending Fresh catalysts are also at play. On October 1, Japan’s SBI Holdings launched an XRP institutional lending program, sparking a 164.5 million token trading volume spike, double the daily average. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-listed VivoPower announced a $19 million raise to expand its XRP treasury, adding another layer of institutional validation to the rally. XRP’s fully diluted valuation has now approached $300 billion ($298.7B), while the number of holder addresses on the XRP legder remains steady. For an asset often cast as an afterthought next to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the capital rotation in a single trading day is anything but marginal. Still, the path ahead hinges on critical levels and broader market dynamics. The $3 threshold remains a psychological battleground, while Bitcoin’s current 58.06% dominance poses the risk of siphoning liquidity away from altcoins. With ETF decision timelines looming, the question now is if XRP can defend the $2.93 support zone if momentum fades or regulatory delays unsettle traders. The post XRP to the moon?

These four tokens are being discussed not just for hype but for their different strengths, meme momentum, protocol utility, and payments infrastructure. In this article, we will look at each one’s case, Bonk’s surges, Algorand’s TVL rebound, SUI’s growth direction, and then put the spotlight on Remittix to see why it might outshine them all. Bonk: Meme energy meets resistance Bonk (BONK) is holding strong meme coin status on Solana, with a current live price of around $0.00002013. The token has recently pushed higher, battling resistance near $0.0000264. In July, it surged over 15%, breaking through multiple resistance lines. That said, volatility remains a risk. BONK has faced a 10% drop in some sessions amid whale selling and technical reversals. Algorand: Protocol resurgence & DeFi footing Algorand (ALGO) is showing signs of revival as its DeFi ecosystem and TVL rebound. According to recent reports, ALGO’s TVL surged roughly 33%. That kind of growth signals renewed capital inflows and project activity. Its protocol offers fast finality and energy-efficient consensus, qualities attractive to enterprise usage. SUI: Scaling layer, growing ecosystem SUI is gaining investor attention for its move as a high-throughput chain aiming to support scalable dApps and Web3 infrastructure. Some analysts now rank SUI among the “best crypto to buy now,” putting it in the same bracket as Remittix. SUI’s advantages include low latency, a move toward data availability models, and active ecosystem incentives. Growth of developer activity on SUI is becoming a key narrative in its valuation story. Why Remittix may outpace Bonk, ALGO & SUI Compared with Bonk, Algorand, and SUI, Remittix sits at a crossroads of utility, reward mechanics, and listing momentum. Bonk rides memetic and speculative flows, Algorand and SUI count on protocol maturity and ecosystem traction. Remittix combines payment utility, incentives, and growth signals, giving it a broader potential narrative. Remittix is now VERIFIED by CertiK, and it holds the #1 ranking among CertiK’s Pre-Launch Tokens. Its wallet is in beta and undergoing community testing of transfers and integrations. The 15% USDT referral system is live, letting users earn claimable USDT every 24 hours via the Remittix dashboard. Remittix has sold over 673 million tokens, trades at $0.113, and has raised over $26.8 million. It has already secured two CEX listings, having passed $20M and $22M benchmarks, and is preparing a third. It also has a $250,000 giveaway, which increases adoption. Here are five strengths that support why Remittix features on “best crypto to buy now” lists above the others: Direct crypto to bank transfers in 30+ countries Audited by CertiK, built with trust and transparency Ranked number one among pre-launch tokens Ideal for freelancers, remitters and global earners Mass market appeal beyond just the crypto crowd Remittix’s edge over the competition Bonk has the energy of meme culture, Algorand is regaining tactical strength, and SUI rides infrastructure momentum. But among them, Remittix presents the tightest blend of utility, incentives, and momentum. As markets tilt toward meaningful use cases over speculation, Remittix may be uniquely positioned to shine.

Seasonal tailwinds and spot inflows are fueling BTC upside. Short squeezes wiped out over $400 million in positions, supporting the move. Trader Realized Price (TRP) flip and Net Taker Volume of $574M point to renewed buying. Meta description: Bitcoin Q4 rally shows spot inflows and short-squeeze momentum; BTC.D breakout above 60% is key to confirming price discovery — read analysis now. Is Bitcoin’s Q4 rally the start of price discovery? Bitcoin Q4 rally shows characteristics of an early price-discovery phase: spot inflows, a short squeeze that removed significant leverage, and short-term holders moving back into profit. Yet BTC’s path to new highs likely depends on Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) breaking meaningful resistance above 60%. How did recent market flows and on-chain metrics shape October’s move? Shorts increased after a red September close, but a ~3% rebound from $112k triggered a rapid short squeeze that liquidated more than $400 million in leveraged bets. Spot inflows and elevated Net Taker Volume (NTV) — reported at roughly $574 million — confirm aggressive buying underpinning the rally. On-chain indicators also turned constructive. Trader Realized Price (TRP) around $116k flipped below spot, signalling that short-term holders are again profitable and less likely to add selling pressure. These elements create a classic FOMO setup consistent with seasonal Q4 strength seen in prior cycles. Source: CryptoQuant (on-chain metrics) What role will Bitcoin dominance play in determining Q4 targets? Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) acts as the primary gauge of market-wide conviction. Historically, when BTC.D declines, capital rotates into altcoins and limits Bitcoin’s upside. In August and July, BTC.D fell below key supports near 64% and 60% during prior all-time-high attempts, capping momentum. Why is a BTC.D breakout above 60% crucial? A sustained breakout above 60% would indicate capital rotating back into Bitcoin rather than altcoins, amplifying bullish momentum and increasing odds that BTC can enter an extended price-discovery phase. TradingView data show BTC.D testing and forming resistance near 59–60% in recent sessions. Source: TradingView (BTC.D) How likely is a Q4 target near $200k? Analyst and on-chain models cited by market commentators point to a scenario where a near-60% rally in Q4 is feasible if momentum, flows and BTC.D align. Historical averages for Q4 across recent cycles show meaningful upside, but a $200k target would require sustained inflows and a dominance breakout to maintain broad market FOMO. Frequently Asked Questions What on-chain metrics matter most for tracking a Q4 rally? Net Taker Volume (NTV), Trader Realized Price (TRP), and exchange flow metrics are key. Rising NTV and TRP flipping below spot indicate buy-side conviction and short-term holder profit recovery — both bullish signs for price continuation. When did the short squeeze occur and how big was it? The short squeeze followed BTC’s rebound from $112k and removed over $400 million in short positions, tightening liquidity and accelerating the upward move in early October.

Short squeeze amplified momentum : Over $400M in short liquidations tightened liquidity and accelerated the rally. BTC.D is the go/no-go : A breakout above 60% is the clearest signal that Bitcoin can enter sustained price discovery; monitor BTC.D closely. Conclusion Bitcoin’s Q4 rally combines classic market drivers — seasonal strength, spot inflows, and short-covering — to create a credible upside scenario. For BTC to sustain a true price-discovery phase and reach higher targets, Bitcoin dominance must confirm the move by breaking above key resistance. Traders should watch BTC.D, NTV and TRP for decisive confirmation and risk manage accordingly.",Bitcoin|News|BTC|FLOW,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-02 09:04:24

According to Ripple developers, the MPTokensV1 amendment was activated on October 1, at around 01:12 PM UTC, after receiving 28 approvals out of 38 validators. The upgrade embeds the new token standard directly into the XRP Ledger , which means developers no longer have to hard-code custom smart contracts for tokenization projects. The new token standard, Multi Purpose Tokens, just got activated on the XRP Ledger ✅. Let the tokenization of everything enter the next stage! pic.twitter.com/75YaXwjzql — Vet 🏴‍☠️ (@Vet_X0) October 1, 2025 “MPTs are a new token standard on XRP Ledger built to meet the practical needs of developers and institutions… No custom contracts. No wasted cycles,” the RippleX developers account stated on X, announcing the launch of the MPT whitepaper. Ripple said the new token standard will help financial institutions eliminate several problems in RWA tokenization , including the need for extensive security audits, complex bespoke contract logic, and meeting regulatory rules. MPT standard to simplify RWA token launches According to an insight by Cryptopolitan in September, MPT tokens have introduced a set of core features that could improve security, transparency, and interoperability in the tokenization market. Ripple developers have listed metadata integration as one of the provisions, which allows issuers to embed information directly into a token’s definition or link external resources through a URI field. The metadata helps assets to carry legal documentation, identifiers, or terms of use directly on the ledger as a clear and verifiable record. MPTs also allow issuers to delegate day-to-day operations by authorizing a secondary key, known as a “Regular Key,” in activities such as freezing balances. The issuer’s Master Key, meanwhile, can be held securely offline to significantly reduce its exposure to security risks. The new standard will use XRPL’s native multi-signature functionality through Signer Lists, where issuers can set requirements like approvals for altering token settings or executing token clawbacks. MPT standard presents fungible token properties on XRPL An explainer shared by Ripple engineer Kenny Lei on X stated that any MPT account can issue tokens, allowing issuers to create large quantities and varieties from a single address. However, they cannot hold their own tokens, and sending coins back to the issuer results in their automatic burn. Operational management encourages issuers to use separate hot wallets for holding their own assets. Burned tokens are treated as having been returned to the issuer for accountability. More importantly, holders cannot be forced to accept tokens, and they must first establish a transaction that signals their willingness to hold them. Each MPT issuance is uniquely identified by a 192-bit Issuance ID, a distinct identifier for every issuance. Currency codes on MPTs can be displayed through metadata, but the system does not guarantee uniqueness of those codes. Issuers also have the option to configure a supply cap to ensure that the number of tokens in circulation never exceeds a set limit. Tokens can be burned and reissued, although their circulation will always come below the established cap. As XRPL launches MPT tokens, Ripple’s chief technology officer, David Schwartz, is saying goodbye to the development team after 13 years of service. He was one of the original architects of the XRP Ledger in June 2012, alongside Jed McCaleb and Arthur Britt, in June 2012. In a post on X, Schwartz revealed that he will retire from day-to-day responsibilities by the end of the year. The CTO said he had been “taking stock of my last 40 years” and called his time at Ripple a “wild ride.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|WALLET|XRP|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-02 09:04:35

The agreement , valued at more than $675 million, is set to create one of the largest institutional investment vehicles for the token, with plans to buy more than $1 billion worth of AVAX. The news has fueled optimism among traders and institutional investors, lifting AVAX to an intraday high of $31.32. Although the token later eased back, it remains one of the top-performing assets in the sector this quarter, supported by renewed confidence in Avalanche’s ecosystem and rising network activity. The new treasury vehicle targets $1B in AVAX According to the agreement, Avalanche Treasury Co., often referred to as AVAT, will merge with Mountain Lake, a Nasdaq-listed special purpose acquisition company, and list publicly in early 2026 under the ticker “AVAT.” The structure gives institutional investors a regulated way to gain exposure to AVAX while also promising active participation in the Avalanche network. Already, Avalanche Treasury Co. has disclosed an initial purchase of $200 million worth of AVAX at a discounted rate through its exclusive relationship with the Avalanche Foundation. Notably, the deal has attracted backing from some of the most influential names in digital asset investing, including Galaxy Digital, Pantera Capital, VanEck, ParaFi Capital, Kraken, FalconX and Dragonfly. Individual figures such as Emin Gün Sirer, the founder of Avalanche’s development firm Ava Labs, are also directly involved. Sirer will serve as an adviser to the new company, while Avalanche’s Chief Business Officer John Nahas is expected to join its board. Leadership will be provided by Bart Smith, a Wall Street veteran with more than two decades of experience at firms such as Susquehanna International Group and AllianceBernstein. Smith has described the treasury as a “growth engine” for the Avalanche network, saying it will fund promising projects and strengthen token adoption rather than act as a passive holder of assets. Active strategy for ecosystem growth Unlike traditional funds that only accumulate tokens, Avalanche Treasury Co. has outlined a three-pronged approach for deploying its capital. The company will invest directly in protocols that can drive adoption, support validator infrastructure to secure the network, and work with enterprises on tokenisation of real-world assets and stablecoins. This active mandate is seen as crucial at a time when institutional demand for digital asset exposure is rising. Bitwise has already filed for an Avalanche ETF in the United States, and other companies such as AgriFORCE Growing Systems have announced similar plans to launch AVAX-focused treasuries. Avalanche Network activity adds momentum Beyond the treasury deal, Avalanche’s on-chain activity has surged in recent weeks. The network processed more than 50 million transactions in the past month, up 201% from the previous period, while active addresses grew by 22% to more than 753,000. A large portion of this activity has come from decentralised finance (DeFi) applications such as Trader Joe and Aave, alongside growing adoption of tokenised real-world assets, where Avalanche now ranks as the fourth largest chain. The recent Octane upgrade, which cut transaction fees by 98%, has further boosted the blockchain’s scalability and appeal. Increased network usage not only validates Avalanche’s technology but also feeds directly into AVAX demand, since part of the fees are burned, reducing supply. AVAX price outlook At the time of writing, AVAX trades around $30.72 with a market capitalisation of nearly $13 billion. While the latest rally has slowed at the $30–$31 resistance zone, AVAX is still up more than 30% from September lows. According to analysts , the token must hold support near $27.69 to maintain its bullish outlook, and a decisive break above $32.77 could open the door to further gains toward $34.93 and possibly $37.54.

XRP remains one of the most recognised assets in cross-border finance, but with its price consolidating around $3.40, traders searching for sharper upside are looking elsewhere. One name consistently appearing on watchlists is Remittix (RTX) , a PayFi project that’s already raised over $26.8 million, launched a working wallet, and could rally 15–20x by the end of October, according to early projections. XRP price prediction: Steady gains, but limited upside At the time of writing, XRP trades around $2.94, hovering between key support at $2.80 and resistance near $3.10. The XRP Price Prediction for Q4 suggests a modest climb toward $4.20, assuming continued progress on Ripple’s remittance partnerships and steady market sentiment. Crypto analyst , Ali, predicts XRP could bounce toward $3.00-$3.15. While this represents healthy growth, it’s far from the parabolic runs in smaller-cap tokens. Ripple’s strength lies in its enterprise partnerships and established infrastructure, not high-risk speculation. This maturity makes XRP appealing for long-term holders but less exciting for traders seeking 10x–20x moves. The market narrative has shifted toward newer projects showing faster adoption cycles and working tech. Analysts say that unless XRP’s daily volume spikes and new utility layers emerge, it’s unlikely to match the returns investors see in fast-rising presales like Remittix (RTX) . Remittix: The altcoin analysts expect to rally 15–20x Remittix (RTX) has rapidly become one of the most discussed altcoins of 2025 and for good reason. Built on Ethereum, it’s pioneering PayFi, a new decentralised finance segment connecting crypto directly to traditional banking. Through its system, users can send digital assets straight to bank accounts across 30+ countries, with live FX rates and zero reliance on centralised exchanges. With its presale funding already surpassing $26.8 million, RTX has drawn in over 40,000 holders and earned recognition as one of the best crypto projects to watch heading into Q4. The project’s 15% USDT referral program drives viral growth, paying users daily through the Remittix dashboard. Remittix (RTX) is not just promising. It’s delivering. Its wallet beta is live, giving users real access to the PayFi platform before listings. Security-wise, it’s verified by CertiK and ranks as the #1 Pre-Launch Token on CertiK Skynet, signalling top-tier transparency and credibility. Why Remittix could rally 15–20x: Over $26.8M raised, confirming global investor confidence Wallet beta live, showing real PayFi transfers in action 15% USDT referral program, rewarding users daily Verified by CertiK, ranked #1 Pre-Launch Token on Skynet Bridging crypto and fiat, real-world adoption, not speculation This combination of strong fundamentals, live tech, and growing exposure makes Remittix a standout contender for near-term upside. XRP price prediction holds steady as Remittix emerges as the altcoin to watch for 15–20x october gains The XRP Price Prediction points to stability, not fireworks. While Ripple remains a trusted name in payments, Remittix is stealing attention with real use cases, verified trust, and community-driven momentum. If early projections prove accurate, RTX could be the altcoin that delivers the 15-20x rally investors hoped to see from XRP.

The launch triggered both speculations and optimism among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Some have attacked the project for recycling teams, undisclosed collaborations, and early token dumps, narratives that have likely hindered XPL’s anticipated takeoff. That’s why Plasma co-founder Paul took it to X to ensure clarity. He has pushed back against prevailing misinformation while shifting the bias towards the project’s primary objective of creating a stablecoin infrastructure that serves the new global monetary system. We’ve seen a number of rumors circulating since the launch of XPL and want to set the record straight. Paul @pauliepunt · Follow We’ve seen a number of rumors circulating since the launch of XPL and want to set the record straight.1/ No team members have sold any XPL. All investor and team XPL is locked for 3 years with a 1 year cliff.2/ Of our team of ~50, three spent time at Blur or Blast. Our team 12:11 AM · Oct 2, 2025 28 Reply Copy link Read 4 replies Tokens locked for 3 years with a 1-year cliff Plasma faced the pressing rumors that most early-stage cryptocurrency projects encounter. Some market watchers speculated that insiders are using the community as exit liquidity, offloading XPL days after the token’s launch. Paul set the record straight: No team members have sold any XPL. All investor and team XPL is locked for 3 years with a 1-year cliff. With this lock-up model, neither the team nor early backers can access their XPL assets until Plasma digs deeper into its roadmap. Such structures remove the fear of sudden dumps that might destabilize markets and dent community confidence. That’s crucial for an early-stage project, since it confirms the Plasma team is interested in long-term players and not profit-hunting. “Ex-Blast” labelling is wrong Another narrative that has gained traction is that most of Plasma’s team members are from Blast or Blur. Paul confirms that only three of around 50 staff at Plasma previously worked with either of the projects. He added that they have a diverse team with experience from top institutions like Goldman Sachs, Facebook, Google, Nuvei, Temasek, and Square. To say our team is ‘ex-Blast’ is to say it is ‘x’ any of these firms. We are proud of the team we’ve assembled at Plasma. The clarification demonstrates the breadth of technical and financial experience behind the Plasma project. No links with Wintermute The co-founder also refuted claims of a concealed collaboration with leading trading firm Wintermute. He emphasized that Plasma has never sought Wintermute’s services or hired them as market maker, and has no idea about their XPL holdings. That means there are no shadow plans to influence the altcoin’s liquidity or performance behavior. We have the same information as the public on Wintermute’s ownership of XPL. XPL price outlook Plasma’s native token trades at $0.9517 after a minor 0.9% dip over the past 24 hours. XPL gained nearly 15% the previous week amid TVL surges and meme token activities . However, rumors and speculations about the project have likely limited the alt’s growth. Chart by Coinmarketcap Enthusiasts will watch the alt’s performance in the coming session as the team seeks credibility, with a focus on long-term building. Paul finalized: We are laser-focused on building the future of money and won’t be commenting further. We remain incredibly grateful for our community’s support. Now back to work.

While such community-led projects have attracted committed followings, emerging DeFi projects with real-world utility — like Remittix (RTX) — are attracting investors who are on the lookout for the top crypto presale 2025 and next big altcoin of 2025. As the market trends in the direction of utility and usability, these tokens represent contrasting paths — speculation and purpose — and the investors are analyzing which way is truly able to sustain long-term value. Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin performance trends Shiba Inu Coin trades at $0.00001222, increasing 4.29% over the last 24 hours, with a market cap of $7.2 billion and $194.78 million in volume over 24 hours, showing moderate growth supported by solid retail demand. Shiba Inu Price action remains predominantly driven by SHIB burn mechanisms and sentiment-induced shifts in liquidity, with Shiba Inu News focused on expanding the size of its ecosystem through the development of Layer 2 Ethereum alternatives such as Shibarium. Pepe Coin, at a price of $0.00000961 and 4.9% higher, has seen its market capitalization increase to $4.04 billion backed by a robust $550.48 million in daily trading volume. Although born out of a meme, Pepe Coin continues to build momentum on centralized and decentralized exchanges but remains dubious regarding its fundamentals for the long run versus crypto with actual use. Remittix Beta Wallet live with real-world utility While meme coins steal all the limelight, Remittix (RTX) at $0.1130 per token is leading the charge with its borderless cryptocurrency payments-oriented cross-chain DeFi initiatives. The Remittix Beta Wallet is live today and supports 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies to let users send cryptocurrency directly to bank accounts in 30+ countries. This real-world application case places RTX in the leading DeFi projects 2025, resonating with freelancers, businesses, and remitters looking for low gas fee crypto with real-time FX conversion and clean rates.

Analysts are debating whether DOGE could soar toward $1 in 2025 or stall far below. Into that conversation steps Remittix , now being thrown into comparisons. Can it outperform in a cycle where Dogecoin is already entrenched? Dogecoin Price Prediction: Can DOGE Hit $1 in 2025? Dogecoin is trading near $0.25 with momentum often influenced by social sentiment, ETF developments, and technical breakouts. Some analysts view the recent breakout past trendlines as a positive sign, projecting DOGE could target $0.40 to $0.97 in bullish conditions. Still, reaching $1 demands perfect alignment. Sustained inflows from institutions, massive retail excitement, scarcity narratives, and minimal resistance from holders would all be required. Remittix vs DOGE: Why Some Favor Remittix Now DOGE’s gains are often driven by narrative, social momentum, and macro mood swings. Remittix , in turn, is building a grounded foundation blending incentive structures, security, and product mechanics. The Remittix team is now VERIFIED by CertiK, and Remittix holds the #1 spot among CertiK’s Pre-Launch Tokens, a strong early certification. Its wallet is in active beta, being stress tested by community users through transaction flows, UX, and integration paths. That gives it an asymmetric upside profile in an environment where meme tokens are crowded and volatile. The 15% USDT rewards model is live, enabling users and referrers to claim USDT every 24 hours via the Remittix dashboard. On metrics, Remittix has sold over 673 million tokens, its price is $0.113, and it has raised over $26.8 million. It also has a $250,000 giveaway, which increases adoption. It already passed major funding thresholds of $20 million and $22 million to land two CEX listings, with a third listing in preparation. Here are five advantages giving Remittix a stronger case in this cycle: Direct crypto to bank transfers in 30+ countries Audited by CertiK, built with trust and transparency Ranked number one among pre-launch tokens Ideal for freelancers, remitters and global earners Mass market appeal beyond just the crypto crowd These strengths may help Remittix buck the “just hype” fate of many meme coins. With listing momentum, reward mechanics, and community alignment, Remittix’s narrative is more sustainable, making it a plausible pick for those who think DOGE’s $1 run might be overextended. The Smarter Bet in 2025 Dogecoin price prediction toward $1 in 2025 is exciting, but it is a steep climb requiring near-perfect market conditions. Remittix , by contrast, blends hype potential with structural backing, incentive alignment, and listing catalysts. If utility and adoption matter more than meme momentum this cycle, Remittix may well outperform DOGE in percentage gain, especially from here.

52558967,https://invezz.com/?p=2908281,1759396695,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"The best altcoins to buy now for highest returns are AVAX, PEPE & Remittix",https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/02/the-best-altcoins-to-buy-now-for-highest-returns-are-avax-pepe-remittix/,"Crypto markets are heating up this October, and investors are looking for the best altcoins to buy for both short-term gains and long-term growth. Avalanche (AVAX) has been seeing strong institutional activity, Pepe Coin (PEPE) is testing key support levels, and Remittix (RTX) continues to grow as a trending PayFi altcoin. While AVAX and PEPE offer potential, Remittix combines real-world utility with growing adoption, making it a top contender for returns this quarter. AVAX price update: Institutional backing drives momentum AVAX is currently trading at $30. The cryptocurrency has been recovering from a recent dip to $29 and is testing support near $34. Institutional investors are fueling AVAX’s momentum. AgriFORCE Growing Systems rebranded as AVAX One and aims to raise $550 million to accumulate AVAX. The Avalanche Foundation is also seeking $1 billion for US-based crypto treasury vehicles. Analysts note that AVAX is trading inside a Macro Wedge pattern since early 2024. A monthly close above the $38.40 breakout level could enable a repeat of the bullish history seen in mid-2021 and early 2024. Failing this, support levels near $29–$30 may be tested again, with the next drop risking the $23.60 monthly opening. Pepe Coin price analysis: Testing critical support Pepe Coin is currently $0.00000964. The token is consolidating around $0.0000090, which is a major support. The failure of this level may push PEPE to $0.0000085- $0.0000080. Resistance is at the bottom end at $0.0000105-$0.0000110. PEPE has been having a hard time with bullish momentum since September. The Indonesian recognition had a short-term effect of driving investors to show more interest, but the wider meme coin sentiment went cold, and the price neared critical support. Investors are keeping a close eye on catalysts such as market sentiment, turnover or community-related events that will likely trigger the next breakout. Remittix: The PayFi altcoin ready to outshine others Remittix (RTX) has raised over $26.8 million, sold more than 673 million tokens, and is currently priced at $0.1130. It is emerging as a trending PayFi altcoin with strong real-world utility, giving it an edge over other altcoins this quarter. Why Remittix is gaining investor attention: Ranked #1 on CertiK, giving top-level security and trust. Wallet beta is live, allowing early community testers to interact with the platform. Users can send crypto directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries. Supports more than 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies. Early investors earn 15% referral rewards in USDT, claimable every 24 hours. These features make Remittix practical for real transactions while offering high growth potential. Its adoption and utility give investors a strong reason to consider it alongside AVAX and PEPE. Conclusion: Remittix stands out among the best altcoins to buy AVAX shows strong institutional support, and Pepe Coin is holding key levels that could trigger a breakout. However, Remittix combines security, adoption, and practical utility, making it the most promising option for investors seeking the best altcoins to buy right now. With CertiK verification, a live wallet beta, and real-world crypto-to-bank functionality, Remittix provides both safety and growth potential in one package. For those aiming for returns this quarter, Remittix tops the list of trending altcoins.

Difficulty, which resets every 2016 blocks (approximately every two weeks), measures how challenging it is for miners to find new blocks and maintains the average block time at around 10 minutes. The increase reflects continued growth in the network’s hash rate, now above one zettahash at 1.05 ZH/s. A higher hash rate signals more machines competing to secure the network, boosting security while raising the bar for profitability. That pressure is showing up in hashprice, miner revenue per unit of hashrate ,which has slipped under $50 per petahash per second, Luxor data shows. The metric briefly touched $52 when bitcoin traded above $118,000 earlier this summer, but has since drifted lower as difficulty rose and prices softened. For miner margins to improve, one of three levers would need to move: higher fees, which remain at multi-year lows, a rebound in bitcoin’s price, or a slowdown in network hash rate. Despite record difficulty and falling hashprice, mining stocks have rallied alongside bitcoin’s surge above $118,500, with Cipher Mining (CIFR) up more than 51% over the past month, Bit Digital (BTBT) gaining 25%, and Marathon Digital (MARA) climbing nearly 16%",Markets|Bitcoin|Hashrate|btc|Mining|News,EN,0,0,MINING|BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-02 09:28:05

Cardano has built a reputation for academic seriousness and layered architecture focused on scalability and security, but its snail-like development pace and anemic DeFi adoption have put it at risk of slowing down to let next-generation protocols catch up. That’s where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly picking up the pace. Priced as low as $0.035 in presale stage 6 when it has exceeded 55% sold, Mutuum Finance is innovating in DeFi with its twin lending infrastructure, a level of flexibility Cardano’s ecosystem is still to reach. With over 16,700 holders, $16.7 million in funding, and analysts predicting a potential 45x price rise in 2025, some now see MUTM as not only an ADA alternative, but also the smarter and more profitable bet on the next bull run. Cardano (ADA) Sits at Crucial Support With Potential Upside Towards $0.92 Cardano (ADA) has been in a period of correction after a pullback from its latest resistance level but technicals now suggest that a likely bullish breakout is imminent. The price has broken above a flag pattern, typically an indication of more strength to the upside, and is currently holding firm around a key support level. If the purchasing pressure continues to build up, analysts feel that ADA could stage a big rally towards the $0.88–$0.92 levels in the near term, which would trigger broader investor demand. But before investors get the confirmation of this turnaround, a few are already eyeing early-stage DeFi initiatives with even bolder growth potentials, a phenomenon that has left many keeping a keen interest on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as sideways opportunity in their 2025 strategies. Investor Confidence Soars as Mutuum Finance Presale Breaks New Ground Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has shattered another presale record, raising more than $16.7 million as phase 6 continues. Tokens are currently at $0.035, a 16.17% increase from Phase 5. Investor sentiment is still strong, with more than 16,700 supporters showing faith in the long-term vision of the project. Security holds the highest priority for Mutuum Finance. It has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, inviting security researchers and developers to find bugs and report them and get paid for it. The bugs are graded on four severity levels: critical, major, minor, and low, providing end-to-end security and lending impetus to the security strategy of the platform. Mutuum Finance has dynamic LTV and liquidation rates that automatically shift based on the market conditions in real-time so that the protocol is highly responsive to volatility. Reserve multipliers would range from 10% for risk assets to 35% for conservative assets to offer a second layer of systemic safety. Efficiency and Collateral Optimization Efficiency is an underlying value of Mutuum Finance. Collateral is reduced to assets to maximize the utilization of capital, and correlated assets are optimized for better lending and borrowing efficiency. These processes reduce insolvency risk, enhance user trust, and enable a more stable and sustainable lending system. To let early adopters feel privileged, Mutuum Finance organized a $100,000 giveaway , and ten individuals will receive $10,000 of MUTM tokens. The campaign encourages users to participate and engage during the presale. Volatility is also the key area of focus in the collateral management of Mutuum Finance. LTV rates and risk classes are based on asset volatility, whereas reserve multipliers range from 10% for low-risk assets to 35% for high-risk ass. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $16.7 million from 16,700+, and Phase 6 over 55% sold at $0.035 per token. Cardano lacks a dual lending mechanism and dynamic risk management, which are more efficient and have potential for growth. Up to 45x returns in 2025 are predicted by the analysts. Lock your tokens before the presale ends.

Analysts Answer!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/how-will-the-us-government-shutdown-affect-bitcoin-btc-and-cryptocurrency-markets-analysts-answer/,"Following the budget crisis in the USA, the budget bill failed to receive approval and the US government officially shut down after 7 years. At this point, due to the impact of the lockdown, many employees will be put on unpaid leave and the publication of key economic indicators such as employment and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data will be suspended. While some are wondering how this will affect Bitcoin (BTC) and the cryptocurrency market, historical data shows that government shutdowns do not have a direct negative impact on crypto markets. Analysts also stated that the US government shutdown would have little impact on Bitcoin, with Bitcoin gaining 3.6% following the shutdown, while major altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) gained between 4% and 7%. Speaking to CoinDesk, 21Shares analyst Matt Mena said the US lockdown accelerated BTC’s rise on hopes of increased liquidity. Mena stated that the delay in the unemployment data scheduled to be released on Friday and the weak ADP employment data released during the shutdown will increase the likelihood of the Fed making further interest rate cuts, and this will support the rise in Bitcoin. At this point, Mena said that Bitcoin will continue to rise if there is a 50 basis point reduction from the Fed by the end of the year and signals of easing quantitative tightening. “The price surge experienced by BTC following the US Government shutdown could be a sign of an explosive rally to come.” Crypto analytics platform SwissBlock also said that the government shutdown in the US will have little impact on the BTC price. According to analysis by Swissblock, the US government shutdown will have minimal impact on the price of BTC. Analysts note that the longest US government shutdown in history, lasting 35 days from December 2018 to January 2019, occurred after Bitcoin had already lost 50% of its value and does not demonstrate a direct correlation. At this point, analysts note that Bitcoin was down approximately 6% during the shutdown, trading between $3,575 and $3,800. Stating that there was no direct negative correlation between BTC and the shutdown, Swissblock described the 6% drop BTC experienced during the previous shutdown as insignificant. *This is not investment advice.

There were about 22 major hacks against multiple protocols and personal wallets reported during the month. Crypto exploits in September slowed down compared to the levels from the previous month. Despite this, the losses from the period reached $127M, from 20 major hacks. Based on Peckshield statistics, September was a relatively slow month for hackers, after August’s theft of $163M. Overall, hacks and exploits are rarer, though some of the attacks are more sophisticated. Crypto exploits targeted smart contract vulnerabilities The most prominent hack for the month was UXLink, with estimated losses of $44M to $48M. The hack was also a double loss, as the exploiter fell prey to another phishing scam, as Cryptopolitan reported . The SwissBorg DEX, losing over $41M, was also among the top hacks for the month. Decentralized losses were smaller, though a single user lost $13.5M to a phishing exploit. The funds were later recovered. Smaller protocols Yala and GriffAI lost another $10.64M in total. The last two months showed hackers were ready to take a detailed look at loopholes in smart contracts. Attacks against decentralized infrastructure included unauthorized token minting , flawed price data, and unauthorized stablecoin withdrawals. Some of the exploits resembled previous activity from DPRK hackers, as the funds were swapped into ETH and immediately mixed. In September, the crypto space was sent into a full panic after the hack of one of the leading npm package repositories. However, the hack ended up stealing just over $1,000 in crypto before apps were patched with safe npm packages. Despite this, supply-chain attacks were still a threat, especially for centralized exchanges. Crypto theft returned in 2025 In total, the whole of Q3 had around $307M stolen through exploits of various sizes. For the year to date, hacks total over $2.55B, including the Bybit exploit . Techniques are changing, with a mix of malicious front ends, wallet drainers, and deliberate smart contract exploits. In Q3, the total haul was a result of mid-sized or small hacks. For the entire quarter, the hacking of the BTCTurk exchange for $54M was the biggest event. The third quarter passed without a major exchange hack, potentially signaling better security or a shift in hackers’ focus. While centralized exchanges cooperate with authorities, hacking in Web3 and DeFi protocols is harder to track. Based on Polymarket predictions, the odds of another $100M or over hack are relatively small. However, the black swan event could immediately sway the prediction pair . Even with slower hacking activity, exploit wallets are busy laundering their funds. In the past quarter, deposits and withdrawals on Tornado Cash have accelerated, tripling since their lows in June. Tornado Cash activity picked up in Q3, as older exploit wallets laundered their funds, while new hackers were quick to swap into ETH and use the mixer. | Source: Dune Analytics The lack of large-scale hacks may thus be a matter of luck, as exchanges mostly operate with similar platforms and have the same vulnerabilities.

Swedish Democrats Dennis Dioukarev and David Perez have filed a motion in the Riksdag, calling on the government to explore the creation of a Bitcoin reserve alongside Sweden’s existing currency and gold holdings. In their proposal, the pair also requested assurances that the legal definition of tender within the Riksbank Act would not be altered, signalling opposition to the introduction of a central bank digital currency. The lawmakers argue that while fiat currencies and gold remain vulnerable to political, geopolitical, and economic pressures, Bitcoin’s value does not depend on the monetary policies of individual nations. As a result, they see it as a potential buffer in an increasingly uncertain global environment. They also pointed to Bitcoin’s fixed supply, low maintenance costs, and role as a deflationary asset as reasons to begin treating it as a serious component of national financial planning. “Bitcoin is currently the world’s sixth-largest asset, on par with silver and larger than global companies such as Tesla, Meta, and Amazon,” the duo said. Bitcoin for innovation and reserves Among their key suggestions was that funding such a reserve could be achieved by retaining confiscated crypto assets rather than liquidating them, allowing Sweden to build a position without tapping into the national budget. According to Dioukarev and Perez, owning Bitcoin would also send a signal that Sweden is open to digital innovation. With over 85 crypto firms operating in the country and dozens of startups, the lawmakers say Sweden has a growing stake in the digital asset space. At present, Sweden does not hold any publicly disclosed Bitcoin reserves . While it is legal to buy and sell cryptocurrencies in the country, and Bitcoin ATMs and exchanges operate under supervision from the Financial Supervisory Authority, there is no official framework recognising digital assets as part of the national reserve system. However, legislation passed in 2024 does allow authorities to seize illicit crypto assets, which opened the door for alternative accumulation methods that Dioukarev and Perez recommend the government tap into. Whether the current motion gains traction remains to be seen. The Swedish Democrats are not part of the ruling government but play a key role in supporting the centre-right coalition led by the Moderate Party. With more than 20% of the vote in the last election, the party has influence but not direct control over policy decisions. The final decision may come down to how much political will exists within the coalition to explore alternatives to traditional monetary tools. Bitcoin as democratic financial tool This is not the first time Swedish lawmakers have floated the idea of a Bitcoin reserve. Earlier this year, both Dioukarev and Centre Party MP Rickard Nordin sent open letters to Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson, urging her to rethink Sweden’s reserve composition and include Bitcoin. At the time, Nordin talked about Bitcoin’s role as a censorship-resistant tool for activists and dissidents and argued that it reflects democratic values that Sweden has long championed.

The integration, marking a first for the European market, the companies said on Thursday, will initially support bitcoin and ether, offering 24/7 trading with the same framework BBVA uses for foreign exchange. SGX has been a digital assets and blockchain tech enthusiast for several years, while BBVA has also been at the forefront among banks when it comes to crypto. SGX FX provides banks with aggregation, pricing, distribution and risk-management tools while maintaining operations across key global data centers in London, New York, Tokyo and Singapore. “SGX FX has built its reputation over 25 years by delivering a platform hardened by decades of live trading for the global FX markets. By tightly integrating digital assets into our existing FX offering, we enable banks like BBVA to move quickly, launch seamlessly, and serve growing client demand – all without the need for a full stack replacement,” said Vinay Trivedi, COO, SGX FX Sell-side Solutions. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation has opened the path for highly regulated firms to offer crypto services and by working with SGX FX, BBVA positions itself to comply with these requirements while meeting rising client demand. “Digital assets are rapidly becoming an integral part of the global finance system.

Meanwhile, analysts are pointing to $4,505 as a key level to watch, with multiple technical setups suggesting that a breakout above this barrier could fuel the next move higher. $4,505 Resistance in Focus Crypto analyst Ali Martinez identified $4,505 as one of the most critical resistance zones for Ethereum. Data from Glassnode’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) shows that around 1.75 million ETH, equal to 2.25% of supply, last changed hands at this price. $4,505 is one of the most important resistance levels to watch for Ethereum $ETH . pic.twitter.com/0QHS2P0P5C — Ali (@ali_charts) October 2, 2025 Notably, this creates a heavy concentration of cost basis, meaning many holders could look to sell or exit when ETH retests the level. With the asset currently below $4,400, a sustained push above $4,505 could ease selling pressure. If the level fails, ETH may face repeated rejection similar to earlier supply clusters. Cup and Handle Breakout Merlijn The Trader pointed to a multi-year cup and handle formation on Ethereum’s chart. The pattern began forming in 2022, with a deep consolidation shaping the cup, followed by a handle retest near $4,300 in 2025. Ethereum has since broken above the neckline. Merlijn described the move as “the holy grail” and noted: $ETH JUST DREW THE HOLY GRAIL. 3 years of chop erased in one breakout. Measured move points vertical. Ethereum’s next stop: five digits. Don’t fade the script. pic.twitter.com/odKqriQvWe — Merlijn The Trader Token2049 (@MerlijnTrader) October 1, 2025 A measured move from the pattern projects a target well above current levels, suggesting potential for a push toward the $10,000 range if the breakout holds. Cycle Repeats Show Parabolic Potential Another analyst, EtherNasyonaL, compared Ethereum’s current structure to past cycles. In both 2016–2017 and 2019–2021, ETH cleared major resistance, retested it as support, and then accelerated into steep rallies. Ethereum is now showing the same setup for a third time. The coin has retested resistance, turned support at around $4,388. According to EtherNasyonaL: “Ethereum has experienced nearly identical scenarios across three distinct market cycles.” If history repeats itself, ETH could be preparing for another large upward phase. Source: EtherNasyonaL/X ETH/BTC Pair Shows Room to Run Michaël van de Poppe focused on Ethereum’s ratio against Bitcoin. The pair rose 144% from May to August before correcting. It now trades near 0.0366 BTC, with support marked at 0.03250 BTC as an “ideal zone for buys.” Van de Poppe explained : “Given that the BTC pair is currently nicely holding up here, and has provided a standard correction, I think that we’ll see this one pick up momentum in the coming weeks.” He added that ETH typically gains after Bitcoin rallies and then slows, creating space for altcoins to perform.

They have asked the government to guarantee that the laws guiding the central bank’s policy will remain unchanged, ruling out the issuance of a CBDC. Dennis Dioukarev and David Perez, however, told parliament that Sweden should not stand on the sidelines while countries like the US move ahead with reserves, urging it to join the digital arms race. Their proposal primarily urges the government to integrate Bitcoin as a central part of Sweden’s reserves , rather than treating it as an experiment. Swedish lawmakers are urging the government to adopt Bitcoin Dioukarev and Perez suggested the Swedish reserve could be financed with confiscated Bitcoin, though they admitted it’s still unclear who would oversee it. According to Bitbo, Sweden has no official Bitcoin stash . Yet, since November 2024, the government has had the power to seize luxury possessions, including cryptocurrency, regardless of whether they are the primary subject of an investigation. Nonetheless, framing Bitcoin as more than just a speculative asset, the two lawmakers are urging the government to embrace it as part of the national reserve strategy. Dioukarev even cautioned, “We are entering an era where relying solely on gold and foreign currencies is insufficient.” Perez also argued that Bitcoin’s limited supply and global market make it a safeguard for sovereignty, especially as confidence in fiat currencies weakens. The lawmakers added that Sweden risks falling behind Finland and Norway if it stays too cautious. To both Dioukarev and Perez, the scarcity, borderless efficiency, and low-cost base of Bitcoin provide real-world benefits that traditional currency lacks. “Bitcoin is currently the world’s sixth-largest asset, on par with silver and larger than global companies such as Tesla, Meta, and Amazon,” they stated. Dioukarev and Perez say a Bitcoin reserve will certify digital innovation support Observers believe that if Sweden adds Bitcoin to its reserves, it could trigger a chain reaction in Europe, prompting other governments to reassess their approach to digital assets—especially with the US already rolling out a federal Bitcoin reserve. The central focus of the Alem Crypto Fund will be to help spur state-level savings and encourage long-term investments in digital assets. As Cryptopolitan reported, the President of Kazakhstan, Jamart Tokayev, instructed the formation of a national crypto fund to modernize the country’s access to financial tools. The fund will be operated in partnership with Binance Kazakhstan, a locally licensed platform connected to the global Binance family. Moreover, it will start by purchasing BNB tokens and partnering with others to stack the native asset of Binance Chain. “We are proud that Binance Kazakhstan has become the strategic partner of the Alem Crypto Fund. The fund’s choice of BNB as its first digital asset highlights the trust in the Binance ecosystem and marks a new chapter for institutional recognition of cryptocurrencies in Kazakhstan,” said Nurkhat Kushimov, General Manager of Binance Kazakhstan. Dioukarev and Perez believe that a Bitcoin reserve could put the country at the forefront of a major transformation in global finance. The lawmakers explained that Bitcoin could offer Sweden additional protection from the instability that typically rattles conventional reserves, such as those of gold. The lawmakers also said that by owning Bitcoin, Sweden would send a clear message of support for digital innovation.

The US government shutdown rattled traditional markets but strengthened Bitcoin’s safe-haven appeal. Interestingly, new data suggest that the bull cycle still has room. Behind BTC’s Explosive October Rally According to the latest update shared by CryptoQuant, weak economic data added fuel to BTC’s recovery. For instance, the ADP report showed 32,000 job losses, which is the steepest in over two years, while delayed nonfarm payrolls led traders to price in an almost certain October Fed rate cut. A weaker dollar further supported flows into Bitcoin. Regulatory momentum also supported the rally. The SEC moved to ease listing requirements for crypto ETFs, and reviews of Solana, XRP, and other applications are scheduled for this month. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US saw nearly $1 billion of inflows in late September, while BlackRock’s fund crossed $80 billion AUM, and reports indicated Vanguard may revisit its crypto stance. Adding to the optimism, the US Treasury clarified that unrealized Bitcoin gains held by corporations will not be taxed, which is being deemed a landmark policy shift and is widely expected to drive more firms to adopt BTC as a reserve asset. On-chain data echoed the bullish backdrop. CryptoQuant noted that exchange reserves fell sharply from 2.61 million BTC in early September to 2.49 million by October 1, which indicated a strong outflow into cold storage and reduced near-term sell pressure. As Bitcoin entered its so-called “Uptober” phase and gold notched new all-time highs, a wave of bullish sentiment appears to have swept over crypto markets. “Bitcoin’s surge was not due to a single factor but the convergence of macro uncertainty, regulatory shifts, institutional adoption, favorable tax policy, and on-chain supply contraction. Together, these forces created the perfect setup for Bitcoin’s decisive move higher, strengthening confidence that the bull cycle still has room to run.” Crucial Levels For Bitcoin Analyst CasiTrades has flagged $120K-$122K as the critical resistance zone that will define Bitcoin’s next move. As BTC attempts to push toward a new local high, the analyst said that it is “an absolutely critical time to pay attention.” A breakout above this level could open the path to fresh record territory, while a rejection risks triggering a sharp pullback toward $100K or lower. She warned that the current setup carries both high risk and high reward, and uncertainty is running equally strong.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Bitcoin soared nearly 4% yesterday, kicking off ‘Uptober’ with a bang. Most importantly, the token closed above the all-important resistance at $118K. This now means the next major hurdle is its all-time high of $124.5K, beyond which Bitcoin would be in unchartered territory and free to stir up some explosive action. That said, with Bitcoin already up nearly 10% in the past week, a small pullback is not only expected but also ideal if digital gold wants to set up a stronger rally. Ideally, BTC should retest around the $115K mark, which is roughly the 50% level of its recent run-up. This is something classic technical analysis suggests often makes for a healthier move. Still, given that $118K was such a critical breakout level, Bitcoin could also just dip slightly to around $117K before soaring higher from there. Uptober Sends Bitcoin Barreling Toward $120K, Adding Fuel to Bitcoin Hyper’s Fire: Whales Rush to Buy October 2, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bitcoin is currently $118.5K, a 6% increase in the last week . The 24h trading volume is also up by 34% as ‘Uptober’ seems to be rallying traders to the crypto king. $BTC’s parabolic recovery has pushed the total crypto market cap past the $4 trillion mark once again. Are we in bullish times? Who knows. But what we do know is that Uptober started off on the right foot. With Bitcoin pushing past $120K and a new ATH soon, it’s time to look toward the best low cap coins that are more likely to explode with 10x or 100x gains. One such coin is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , already nearing the $20M mark in its crypto presale. It’ll launch a Layer-2 to make Bitcoin faster and more scalable, with dApps and smart contracts. Our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction forecasts a $0.32 price by the year’s end, a 2,358% increase from the current $0.013015 price. Here’s how to buy Bitcoin Hyper before the next price increase. Bitcoin Mining Market Cap Soars in September, Fueling Bitcoin Hyper’s $19.7M Presale October 2, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bitcoin miners experienced a surge in market cap in September according to a JP Morgan report, which states that the top Bitcoin miners surpassed $58B last month. The historic performance rests on miners upgrading their equipment to AI-driven high-power computing to increase productivity. IREN led the charts with a massive 624% increase, followed by Cipher Mining and Applied Digital with 321% and 345% respectively. IREN’s performance follows its recent AI integration , which boosted mining efficiency, lowered operational costs, and brought in a net income of $176.9M. Following the announcement, Bitcoin broke $118K, which may have set it on the road to its October ATH. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin’s Layer 2 solution, also soars, after the $19.7M presale gained a lot of traction in September. Learn what Bitcoin Hyper is right here.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a prime candidate for outsized returns, particularly as Phase 6 of its presale nears completion. This phase has already generated around $16.7 million, with over 16,700 holders participating and 53% of the 170 million allocated tokens sold. The current price is $0.035, and Phase 7 will see a 15% increase to $0.040, making the remaining window for discounted acquisition highly time-sensitive for those serious about investing in crypto coins with growth potential. Utility and Mechanics Driving MUTM’s Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built as a dual lending ecosystem, combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools for stablecoins and major blue-chip assets with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) desks for riskier or less liquid tokens. This architecture will allow the platform to serve a broad range of participants, providing liquidity and yield opportunities while isolating high-risk assets to protect the core pools. The upcoming stablecoin, pegged to $1 and minted only against overcollateralized deposits, will provide a predictable, high-utility asset that strengthens the protocol and encourages borrowing. The Beta launch at token listing will provide users first-hand exposure to live product functionality, fostering trust and adoption. Layer-2 integration will ensure low transaction costs and high-speed execution, making frequent borrowing and repayments economical and efficient. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also implement a buy-and-distribute mechanism, where protocol revenue is used to repurchase MUTM tokens and distribute them to mtToken stakers. This system will create steady, programmatic buy pressure and reward long-term participants. Additionally, the platform’s dashboard and Top-50 leaderboard is already gamifying user engagement and simplifying tracking returns, attracting both novice and experienced investors and encouraging ongoing participation. Market Access and Realistic Path to $2 Beyond the protocol mechanics, strategic listings on leading exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken will multiply retail access and liquidity. These listings, combined with high adoption from the beta phase, will support sustainable token demand and set the stage for a price trajectory toward $2 by mid-2026. MUTM’s dual lending model, stablecoin mechanics, and buyback incentives provide measurable pathways for token appreciation, which contrasts with speculative bets on other crypto coins that lack systemic demand drivers. To illustrate, an investor purchasing 20,000 MUTM tokens at the current Phase 6 price of $0.035 will invest $700. When Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reaches $2 in mid-2026, this position will be valued at $40,000, demonstrating a significant return driven by the combination of P2C/P2P lending, stablecoin utility, staking rewards, and liquidity expansion through exchange listings. Each day of delay in participating risks missing the upcoming 15% price adjustment in Phase 7, further emphasizing the urgency for action.

52559452,594533,1759399225,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52559452.jpeg,Japan’s Metaplanet Becomes 4th Largest Bitcoin Treasury After $615M Buy,https://bitcoinist.com/metaplanet-4th-largest-bitcoin-treasury-615m-buy/,"Bitcoin treasury company Metaplanet has announced a fresh purchase that has brought its holdings to fourth place on the BTC corporate ranking. Metaplanet Has Acquired Another 5,268 Bitcoin As revealed by Metaplanet President Simon Gerovich in a new post on X, the Japan-based Bitcoin treasury company has completed a new acquisition. In all, the company has added 5,268 BTC to its holdings at an average price of $116,870 per BTC or $615.67 million in total with the purchase. The buy has arrived just nine days after the firm made its record acquisition of 5,419 BTC. This latest purchase has only been slightly smaller than this biggest buy, indicating that the treasury company is currently participating in some rapid accumulation. This is in contrast to the trend developing in the purchases of Strategy (formerly Microstrategy), the popularizer of the Bitcoin corporate treasury strategy. Although Michael Saylor’s firm has continued to buy recently, its purchases have been significantly smaller than earlier in the year. The aggressive buying from Metaplanet has meant that its standing among Bitcoin treasuries has changed, with its holdings now ranking the fourth largest. Below is a table from BitcoinTreasuries.net comparing the top 10 BTC corporate holders. Before the latest two massive purchases, Metaplanet was below Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company and Bullish, but now it has leapfrogged both with total holdings of 30,823 BTC. The firm acquired its BTC stack for a total cost of $3.33 billion. At the current exchange rate, its value stands at $3.61 billion, implying the company is sitting on an unrealized gain of around 8.4%. A chart shared by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn shows how the profit-loss balance of Metaplanet has changed since adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy. As displayed in the above graph, the recent bearish retrace in Bitcoin has meant that Metaplanet’s holdings have lost some of the gains from during the cryptocurrency’s peak earlier in the year. Another chart posted by the analyst puts into perspective where the company’s break-even line lies. At the moment, Metaplanet’s cost basis sits at $107,912. BTC came close to retesting the level during its recent decline, but its price has since gained a decent gap over it again. Metaplanet set out a target of 30,000 BTC for financial year 2025, which it has now exceeded following its latest acquisition. According to the company, its “ Phase II ” will involve a 2027 target of 210,000 BTC, equivalent to 1% of the cryptocurrency’s total circulating supply. BTC Price Bitcoin has seen a jump of almost 4% over the last 24 hours that has taken it back to the $117,600 mark.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Treasury|btc|BTCUSDT|Metaplanet|Metaplanet Bitcoin,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-02 10:00:25
52559449,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=830989,1759399234,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52559449.jpeg,"Dogecoin Will Hit $4 This Bull Run— ‘It’s All Math,’ Says Analyst",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-4-this-bull-run-its-all-math/,"Crypto analyst Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow on X) argues that DOGE remains in a long-duration advance that has not yet delivered its terminal impulse. In a video analysis published on October 1, the analyst lays out a multi-cycle framework built on logarithmic charting, Elliott Wave structure, and Fibonacci extensions, concluding that a run toward roughly $4 per coin is the most probable outcome of the current bull phase. “It’s all math,” he says, adding that liquidity dynamics and market structure—not simplistic notions of market capitalization—will determine how far the move extends. Dogecoin To $4? The analyst opens by dispelling social-media speculation about his identity—“even though I sound like Elon Musk, I’m not Elon Musk. I’m just a random cat”—before pivoting to the core claim: the long-term Dogecoin chart on a log scale shows three pronounced rounding-bottom cycles, each resolving higher, with the third now in progress. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts What Dogecoin Investors Should Expect Price-Wise This Month He characterizes the present structure as a sequence of cup-and-handle formations within that broader rounding base. “During this round of bottoms, we keep on having these kinds of cups and handle type patterns. And every single time when you have a handle… people get extremely, extremely bitter and sad. And I’ve just been buying the handle all the way down,” he says, noting his accumulation began “years” ago and that subsequent pullbacks remained buying opportunities within the cycle view. At the center of the thesis is an Elliott Wave roadmap that treats the 2021 mania as Wave Three, a prolonged corrective phase as Wave Four, and the emerging uptrend as the start of Wave Five. The analyst back-tests the structure using Fibonacci retracements and extensions on a log chart. He highlights that Wave Two retraced to the 0.5 level—“a common retracement for wave two”—while the Wave Three top aligned with a 1.618 extension of Wave One, the classic marker of an extended third wave. From there, the market corrected to approximately the 0.618 retracement—a textbook anchor for a Wave Four pullback—before beginning the present advance. Because Wave Three already extended to 1.618, he argues Wave Five should be shorter in relative terms, making hyper-extended targets less likely. Using the log-scale Fibonacci ladder from the Wave Four base, he proposes a target corridor between the 1.272 and 1.618 extensions, with the latter around $4.13 emerging as his base case. “I think anywhere from 1.272, 1.414, 1.618 would be a reasonable target with the most likely scenario… the 1.618, which is going to be $4.13,” he explains, while allowing for two alternative outcomes—a truncated fifth that stalls near the prior high around $0.76, or a more subdued reach to the 1.272/1.414 zone. The log-scale context is central to his methodology. He cautions that linear arithmetic with nominal prices can lead analysts astray when evaluating multi-order-of-magnitude cycles. He also emphasizes a practical trigger level within the current structure: “once it pushes through 33 cents, it’s going to hit some of the higher targets.” In his view, DOGE found support near a 1.236–1.272 region on the log ladder and is attempting to reassert itself above the 1.618 band—an area he frames as a pivotal resistance-turned-launchpad during prior cycle advances. The Math Behind It Anticipating skepticism around the implied market capitalization—roughly half a trillion dollars at $4—Cantonese Cat argues that cap-table arithmetic is routinely misinterpreted as a funding requirement rather than a reflection of marginal pricing under prevailing liquidity. “I think a lot of people think that you have to have $100 billion to pump Doge to $100 billion market cap. That’s not how it works,” he says. Instead, he attributes the path of least resistance to the interplay of derivatives, credit conditions, leverage, and the broader liquidity regime. “If you have a liquidity condition, if they keep printing money, if the market cycle supports this, you don’t need half a trillion dollars to push Doge to half a trillion dollar market cap.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Could Happen ‘In A Hurry,’ Analyst Warns He concedes that the May 2021 peak involved “a lot of irrational exuberance” but contends that similar dynamics could recur. “Money is what it is. It is an abstract concept. It is based on derivatives, is based on leverage, is based on market condition, is based on liquidity. As far as I’m concerned, just go with the flow.” There are important caveats embedded in his call. He stresses that Wave Five targets on a log scale resist the kind of linear add-ons some traders use, and he underscores path dependency: invalidations can emerge if DOGE fails to reclaim and hold key bands or if macro liquidity tightens materially. He also notes supply dilution—Doge’s ongoing issuance—though he treats it as a secondary consideration in a sentiment- and liquidity-driven supercycle. The alternative outcomes he outlines are explicit: a truncated fifth near $0.76 would mark a conservative terminal, while a stall at 1.272 or 1.414 would still deliver a materially higher high without matching Wave Three’s extension. Even with those guardrails, the thrust of the analysis is unequivocal. “The major impulse of wave five hasn’t really quite happened quite just yet,” he says, framing the market as early in the terminal advance of a multi-year structure. He reinforces that his framework is empirical rather than aspirational. “Use your imagination, follow technicals, it’s all math,” he concludes. For Dogecoin, that math points to a breakout above $0.33 as the next near-term tell and a probabilistic arc that terminates near the $4 handle if liquidity conditions cooperate. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.254.

The collaboration involves Ethereum technology, raising questions about whether SWIFT’s direction could diminish XRP’s role. Crypto proponent John Squire addressed these concerns directly, explaining that the development is not a threat to XRP but rather evidence of a broader shift in the financial system toward blockchain interoperability. His analysis provides context for why XRP holders do not need to worry about this announcement. SWIFT x Consensys News Some in the #XRPArmy panicked when SWIFT announced a blockchain prototype with Consensys (Ethereum). Here’s why $XRP holders don’t need to worry and why the fundamentals remain strong. THREAD #XRP pic.twitter.com/IkSD6JSncs — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) September 30, 2025 SWIFT’s Mission of Interoperability Squire pointed out that SWIFT has never intended to align exclusively with a single token . Its role has always been to connect multiple systems, including public and private blockchains as well as existing payment rails. The new prototype with Consensys should therefore be understood as an extension of SWIFT’s mission to enable interoperability rather than a pivot to Ethereum as a primary settlement asset. Ethereum’s Strengths and Limitations According to Squire, Ethereum remains a powerful platform for smart contracts and pilot projects, which makes it suitable for early prototypes. However, he highlighted Ethereum’s persistent limitations, such as high fees, congestion, and scalability issues. These drawbacks become more evident when attempting to scale to global payments, reinforcing why Ethereum is not optimized for the demands of international settlements. XRP’s Continued Relevance in Payments Squire emphasized that XRP’s strength lies in its utility for payment s. Transactions can be settled within seconds at negligible cost, a capability designed specifically for cross-border transfers. This purpose-built efficiency aligns directly with what SWIFT is exploring as it looks to move large sums across global markets using digital solutions. XRP’s liquidity and speed remain core advantages. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Reaction and Underlying Fundamentals Despite the concerns voiced online, Squire observed that XRP’s price has not been affected by the news. The market appears to understand that this is not a case of Ethereum competing against XRP, but rather a signal that traditional finance is beginning to integrate blockchain technology. That recognition underlines the fact that XRP’s fundamentals remain unchanged. Squire concluded that SWIFT’s prototype does not replace or diminish XRP’s relevance. Instead, it validates the broader transition toward a digital, interoperable, and global financial system. Within that future, XRP continues to stand out as one of the most proven solutions for efficient payments. The message from Squire was clear: holders should remain calm and focused, as the fundamentals supporting XRP remain strong.

On average, that translates to around 86 new Bitcoin millionaires created every day during the quarter. At the start of the quarter, 182,327 addresses held at least $1 million in BTC. By September 30, that figure had risen to 190,199, marking a sharp rebound after a turbulent first quarter. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); Surge in million-dollar and deca-million Bitcoin addresses The growth was not limited to marginal thresholds. Wallets holding $10 million or more in Bitcoin jumped from 20,488 in July to 22,192 by the end of September, a gain of 1,704 new addresses. At the $1 million level, addresses grew from 161,839 to 168,007, an increase of 6,168. This quarter’s expansion highlights the rising wealth concentration in Bitcoin as prices consolidated near all-time highs and large holders accumulated aggressively. A volatile 2025 for BTC The Q3 gains follow a year of sharp contrasts. In Q1 2025, the number of millionaire wallets fell by nearly 14,000, wiping out a significant portion of addresses during market turbulence. By Q2, the trend reversed, with millionaire addresses soaring by 26,758, fueled by Bitcoin’s recovery and ETF inflows. Taken together, 2025 has added a net 20,688 Bitcoin millionaire addresses year-to-date, despite the early-year drawdown. Comparing 2025 to 2024’s record surge By comparison, 2024 recorded 56,325 new Bitcoin millionaire addresses in total, averaging 154 per day. While 2025 is producing fewer new millionaires per day, roughly half the pace of last year, at the moment, the sustained increase in Q3 confirms that high-value wallets continue to expand even under shifting market dynamics. It is important to note that a single individual can control multiple addresses, meaning the number of millionaire wallets does not equate directly to the number of unique millionaires. Even so, the steady increase in high-value addresses reflects renewed confidence in Bitcoin, particularly in the wake of ETF adoption and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.

Traditional tokens like Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) have maintained their positions for years, but a new narrative is forming around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Experts debating which crypto to buy today for holding are highlighting MUTM as a unique presale opportunity, pointing to strong mechanics, a clear roadmap, and the possibility of reaching $1.50 by 2026. For many, this emerging platform represents a smarter direction for investing in crypto in the face of market cycles where headlines often focus on why crypto is down. Presale traction and investment growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now deep into its presale and is demonstrating momentum that many traders are calling a once-in-a-cycle entry point. In Phase 6, the token is priced at $0.035, with around $16.7 million already raised. Over 16,750 holders have joined, and 55% of the 170 million tokens allocated to this phase are gone. With a total supply of 4 billion tokens, each phase is structured to increase value for early entrants. The next stage, Phase 7, will lift the price to $0.040, representing a 15% jump from today’s rate. The presale’s performance has already rewarded early believers. Consider an investor who shifted $10,000 from Solana (SOL) into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 2 when the price was $0.015. Today, at $0.035, that holding is valued at about $23,300—a gain of more than double. Looking forward, with the projected target of $1.50 by 2026, this same investment will grow into a six-figure position, delivering well over 100x ROI. For those weighing whether to wait or act, this is the last stretch to secure MUTM before the Phase 7 increase raises the entry barrier. How lending and borrowing reshape user value What differentiates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from older names is not just presale growth but the real mechanics driving its ecosystem. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model will allow lenders to supply bluechip tokens and stablecoins into audited smart contracts. For example, a user who deposits $12,000 in USDC will receive mtUSDC tokens at a 1:1 ratio. If the pool’s average APY reaches 16%, the depositor will collect $1,920 in interest within a year. This income is earned passively, independent of daily market swings. Borrowers, meanwhile, will unlock liquidity without liquidating assets. By collateralizing $2,500 worth of XRP, a borrower can access $1,750 instantly, based on the assigned loan-to-value ratio. Flexibility will also be key. Borrowers will choose between variable rates that shift with market conditions and stable rates for predictable repayment. This feature will broaden accessibility for different risk profiles while ensuring repayment clears principal plus accrued interest. On the other side of the spectrum, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending will target riskier tokens like SHIB and PEPE. Here, lenders and borrowers will negotiate terms directly, from interest rates to loan durations, offering high-reward opportunities without exposing the main pools to instability. Collateral management will keep the protocol resilient. Assets such as ETH will carry higher loan-to-value ratios of up to 75%, with liquidation thresholds around 80%. Riskier tokens will operate with lower caps, ensuring overcollateralization always protects the system. When collateral values fall below stability thresholds, liquidators will be incentivized with discounts to secure the platform, further maintaining solvency. Security, community, and FOMO Security is a central feature of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). A CertiK audit has already given the token a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79, backed by both manual review and static analysis. The timeline was set for February 25, 2025, and revised for May 20, 2025, showing a commitment to thorough vetting. Reinforcing this, the team has launched a $50,000 bug bounty program, offering rewards up to $2,000 for critical findings. Beyond security, community engagement is thriving with over 12,000 Twitter followers and an ongoing $100,000 giveaway , where ten winners will each take home $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Investor tools will add another layer of confidence. A real-time dashboard allows holders to connect their wallets, view positions, and calculate returns. A Top 50 leaderboard are able to recognize the largest investors, distributing bonus MUTM tokens as a reward for conviction. These features are designed not just for tracking but for gamifying participation, reinforcing loyalty, and encouraging larger allocations. Looking at the road ahead There is more than just guesswork that leads to $1.50. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting ready for a beta launch that will let people try out the platform’s lending and borrowing functions as soon as the token goes live. Expected listings on major exchanges like Binance and KuCoin will also help the platform’s utility reach millions of people around the world. The buy-and-distribute system, which uses revenue to buy back MUTM tokens and reward mtToken stakers, will keep buy pressure up as more people utilize the platform. Experts debating which crypto to buy today for holding are concluding that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents one of the rare opportunities where presale entry, robust mechanics, and strong community alignment combine. For those watching why crypto is down across legacy assets, this presale offers a chance to turn the narrative around. With Phase 6 already 55% sold out, the clock is ticking. Traders expecting $1.50 by 2026 are clear: the time to secure MUTM at $0.035 is now, before the next phase lifts the price and the market discovers its full potential.

After spending much of the past year trading quietly in the shadows, ZEC has surged by more than 140% in the last seven days, briefly touching a three-year high of $153. Following the price surge, ZCash has far outpaced Bitcoin (BTC) , which is experiencing a steadier but far more modest rally. But the question in many traders’ minds is what has fueled this sudden explosion in ZEC’s price, and whether it signals a long-term revival for the coin. Grayscale’s Zcash Trust The catalyst behind the rally has been the launch of Grayscale’s Zcash Trust, which provides accredited investors with regulated exposure to ZEC. Grayscale @Grayscale · Follow . @Zcash is similar to Bitcoin in its design. Zcash $ZEC was created from the original Bitcoin code base, but it uses a privacy technology that encrypts transaction information and allows users to shield their assets.Grayscale Zcash Trust is open for private placement for 6:02 pm · 1 Oct 2025 897 Reply Copy link Read 74 replies The Trust has already attracted more than $46 million in assets under management, and its debut has been widely interpreted as a signal that institutional players are beginning to take privacy coins seriously. Trading activity has surged in parallel, with ZEC’s derivatives market seeing open interest jump more than 200% in just 24 hours to over $120 million. Funding rates have also flipped positive, highlighting a clear shift toward bullish sentiment. This influx of institutional demand marks a departure from the speculative pumps Zcash has seen in the past. It suggests that investors are no longer looking at ZEC as just another volatile altcoin, but as a project with renewed relevance in a market increasingly concerned about surveillance and transparency. Privacy narrative finds new life Notably, the timing of ZEC’s breakout has coincided with a broader debate around privacy in the digital age. In recent months, governments have accelerated their push for central bank digital currencies, which critics argue could erode financial privacy. Crypto voices such as Helius CEO Mert Mumtaz have argued that “a world where crypto succeeds but privacy doesn’t is a dystopian nightmare.” mert | helius.dev @0xMert_ · Follow look some of you are in the replies asking why I’ve been shilling Zcash for a whilerelatively simplei) three important missions in crypto: markets, store of value, privacy/freedomthe last one has been slept on, and it’s about to make a comeback as CBDCs and centralized 1:35 pm · 1 Oct 2025 216 Reply Copy link Read 91 replies Mumtaz’s comments echo the growing unease around the surveillance potential of CBDCs and the risks posed by fully transparent blockchains like Bitcoin. Zcash, with its zero-knowledge proof technology that allows shielded transactions, offers an alternative. It is a coin that enables users to choose between transparent and private transactions, and that flexibility has become increasingly attractive as regulators tighten oversight. Naval Ravikant, the AngelList co-founder and prominent investor, put it succinctly when he described Zcash as “insurance against Bitcoin,” just as Bitcoin is seen as insurance against fiat currency. His endorsement has amplified ZEC’s narrative at a time when privacy is becoming a mainstream concern. Technical analysis paints a bullish picture The technical outlook for Zcash adds to the sense that this rally is more than just hype. ZEC has broken above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $111, retraced from the May 2021 high of $372 down to its July 2024 low of $15. Analysts argue that a decisive close above this level could set the stage for a run toward the next retracement zone at $189, with further upside potential extending to $280 or even $500 if momentum holds. However, the rally has also pushed ZEC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) into overbought territory, flashing at 90 on the daily chart. ZCash price chart | Source: CoinMarketCap While momentum indicators like the MACD remain firmly bullish, traders caution that a pullback or consolidation phase could be imminent. Furthermore, the support levels at $111, $100, and $76 provide a cushion if profit-taking accelerates.

The LTC pump followed a similar attention to ZEC in the past few days. Litecoin (LTC) broke out to $120, gaining ground in the past few hours. The token, which has gradually grown in 2025, broke out from its recent range around $110. LTC lined up among the top 10 gainers for the day, setting expectations for a more significant breakout.

The rally followed an expansion of open interest, from recent lows of $450M to over $600M in the past days. Over 73% of LTC positions are going long, betting on an extended rally. On Hyperliquid, eight out of 14 whales are short on LTC. The token has a limited market on Hyperliquid, mostly due to its sideways trading and a lack of clear direction. Is the LTC breakout sustainable? In the past months, LTC has performed similar breakouts, reaching a recent peak at $140. During the 2025 bull market, LTC has not managed to regain its all-time peak near $400, as traders focused on other assets. The current rally has swept up all available short liquidity, with positions remaining up to $126. This has led analysts to suggest the LTC rally may not be sustainable, as it depends on derivative trading. LTC may rise to liquidate short positions up to $125, but the rally is seen as risky, based on shifting derivative markets. | Source: Coinglass However, the enthusiasm for an October rally may lift LTC higher. In the short term, predictions see the token rallying to its previous peak above $400. LTC ETF may be delayed again LTC has lagged on the ETF side. The coming round of ETF approvals is expected to skip LTC and DOGE once again. The token also has only one treasury company announced, as MEI Pharma announced a $100M raise to acquire LTC . In the short term, the Canary Capital ETF approval was expected on October 2. A negative decision may be one of the factors to stall the current LTC expansion.

After Securitize's tokenization treatment, shareholders can choose to convert their common stock (FGNX) into Ethereum-based tokens, giving them the same legal rights as traditional shares. The company will also tokenize its perpetual preferred stock (FGNXP), which pays regular dividends, making it the first U.S. exchange-listed dividend equity to transition fully onto the crypto rails. The process aims to streamline how public equities are owned and traded using blockchain rails, while being subject to the same regulations and rights as regular securities. The tokenized shares will be settled in near instantaneously, tracked on blockchain and transferred through Securitize’s SEC-registered broker-dealer and Alternative Trading System (ATS). ""Tokenization is rapidly changing financial markets through increased efficiency and enhanced investor access,"" said Maja Vujinovic, CEO of Digital Assets at FG Nexus. ""By tokenizing our shares, we're embracing blockchain technology to further enhance the shareholder experience while maintaining the highest standards of regulatory compliance."" Shift to onchain The move comes as tokenization of financial instruments, such as equity shares, bonds, and funds, is gaining momentum across crypto markets. A wide range of tokenized equity offerings debuted over the past few months, including Robinhood, Gemini, Ondo Finance's Global Markets and xStocks by Kraken and Backed Finance, creating token versions of the largest publicly-traded companies and ETFs. Some firms, like FG Nexus, have chosen native tokenization, a structure that gives identical rights to token holders as regular shares. ""Our project with FG Nexus is expected to result in U.S. investors being able to hold real stock, not a synthetic wrapper, with instant settlement, automated compliance and the ability to trade onchain through our regulated ATS,"" Securitize co-founder and CEO Carlos Domingo said. Securitize, also known for issuing BlackRock's $4 billion tokenized money market fund, was an early mover in this sector, creating tokens of publicly-traded crypto wallet provider Exodus (EXOD) shares on Algorand in 2021. SharpLink Gaming (SBET), another ETH treasury firm, also unveiled plans to introduce its stock on Ethereum with tokenization firm Superstate's Opening Bell platform.

XRP remains a stalwart in cross-border payments, and with fresh impetus around regulatory certainty, due for steady appreciation. But for life-changing returns, eyes are looking at Mutuum Finance, a $0.035 altcoin that’s quickly evolving into a magnet for whale capital. The project is in phase 6 of presale and is over 55% sold out. With its dual lending mechanism, Mutuum Finance is being positioned as a next-generation DeFi solution that’s set to go for mass adoption. Let’s dissect the numbers. Backed by 16,700+ holders and $16.7 million pre-launch capital, the prospect of MUTM converting a $500 investment into $25,000 or more places it in the highly desirable high-reward play category heading into 2025. XRP Breaks Out Above $3 as Whales Accumulate Ahead of Potential ETF Catalyst Ripple’s native digital currency XRP is once again knocking on the important $3 level of resistance, but this time the circumstances look very different. On-chain data shows whales feverishly stacking up while retail interest is comparatively dormant, a configuration that has a tendency to occur before significant price action. Analysts identify the $2.75–$3.10 range as the decisive battleground, and a clean breakout will play a determinative part in defining the next leg of XRP’s market journey. Meanwhile, speculation about a potential spot XRP ETF keeps running strong, further fueling bullish sentiment among institutions. And as the capital begins gearing for dramatic shifts in the altcoin landscape, many are looking at high-potential plays beyond old-guard tokens, with more and more attention being shifted to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Reaches New Peaks Mutuum Finance is storming the DeFi space with its presale, having garnered over 16,700 investors and raised over $16.7 million to date. The presale is currently in Phase 6 and is 55% through, with the MUTM tokens priced at $0.035 per token. As a token of appreciation to its initial supporters, the team has also initiated a $100,000 giveaway , to award 10 lucky winners 10,000 MUTM tokens each. The MUTM Ecosystem As a leader in decentralized finance innovation in the industry, Mutuum Finance leverages Chainlink oracles to enable safe exchange, lending, and settlement of USD-backed tokens, as well as very liquid tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The platform delivers robust data integrity through multi-layered defense like fallback oracle guards, composite data feeds, and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages, with precise and reliable price information even in brutal market environments. Mutuum Finance also introduces a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins that go haywire in bear markets, the token is non-algorithmic and overcollateralized and is designed to provide price stability even in bear markets. The platform incorporates a risk-adjusted Loan-to-Value (LTV) mechanism whereby each asset has an allied collateral ceiling commensurate with its risk profile. This keeps lending in balance and at arm’s length. Apart from the security of users during volatility, the protocol also incorporates a buffer reserve mechanism whereby the riskier assets receive higher reserves as extra collateral and to subsidize the ecosystem. With its presale history, progressive risk management, and commitment to transparency, Mutuum Finance is solidifying its status as a secure, stable, and disruptive DeFi platform. High-ROI Play for 2025 Bull Run Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly establishing itself as one of the standout high-upside DeFi projects of 2025, raising more than $16.7 million from more than 16,700 holders and selling more than 55% of its Phase 6 presale for $0.035 each token. While Ripple (XRP) offers steady returns as an old-timer, MUTM’s twin lending mechanism, dollar-pegged stablecoin, and advanced risk management mechanism offer investors the potential of life-changing gains, where a $500 investment is transformed into $25,000 or more. Early birds can gain access to this trailblazing DeFi platform before the presale completes.

What The Volume Levels Say,https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-0-00008-ath/,"The Shiba Inu price saw an over 5% surge on Wednesday to kick off the new month of October in the green. This was not caused by any development that was unique to the meme coin , but rather by a rapid surge in the Bitcoin price, which took most of the crypto market along with it. Nevertheless, it was a welcome change after a dreary September that saw the Shiba Inu price fall below $0.000012. But as this recovery moves forward, we take a look at the volume and what the levels point to. Volume Levels Show Shiba Inu Price Is Far From All-Time High Using volume data from the Coinglass website, it gives a clear view of participation from crypto investors when it comes to the Shiba Inu and how the meme coin is performing relative to times of rapid price acceleration. At the current level, there is still a lot to be desired, especially as the Shiba Inu daily trading volumes remain quite low. Data shows that the Shiba Inu daily volume was averaging at around $200 million back in September, and this was low compared to the previous months. It also coincides with the drop in participation and the bearish sentiment that plagued the market, especially toward the end of the month. Despite starting out on a bullish note, the month of October has not seen much change either. Coinglass data shows just over $150 million in trading volume at the time of this writing, similar to CoinMarketCap’s $206 million, taking into account spot trading volume. What This Means For The SHIB Price With low volume, it suggests that the Shiba Inu price is not yet ready for a big rally . Looking at historical data, it shows that the times when the biggest rallies have happened for the meme coin were when there were large spikes in volume. This was the case back in 2021 when the Shiba Inu price recorded its all-time high of $0.000088, and the trend has been evident at other times when there have been major rallies, such as back in March 2024 when the price rose from $0.000009 to $0.000023. Given this, there would need to be a large volume influx if the Shiba Inu price is to reclaim its all-time high again. Nevertheless, there have also been some bullish developments for the meme coin , such as exchange balances dropping to their lowest levels since 2023. This suggests that investors are choosing to wait for better prices before they sell, thus reducing the selling pressure on the cryptocurrency.",Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-02 11:30:49

With Phase 6 already 55% sold out, analysts are pointing to an imminent 15% price increase toward $0.040. This rapid progress is drawing attention from the crypto investing community at a time when many are still asking why crypto is down today. The difference is that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another speculative play but a platform with strong utility and a clear roadmap. A platform built for lending, staking, and stability At the current presale price of $0.035, MUTM has raised around $16.7 million with more than 16,750 holders on board. Out of the 170 million tokens allocated for Phase 6, over half have already been secured. With a total supply of 4 billion tokens, each presale phase has been carefully structured to reward early participants, and Phase 7 will soon lift the price to $0.040. That sets the stage for both short-term appreciation and long-term utility growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not designed as just another entry in the growing field of crypto coins. It is being developed as a dual lending ecosystem where users will interact through Peer-to-Contract pools and Peer-to-Peer agreements. In Peer-to-Contract, lenders will supply assets like USDT and ETH into audited smart contracts and earn variable yields. For example, lenders who provide $20,000 USDT into the pool will earn around $2,800 annually at an estimated 14% APY. In Peer-to-Peer, investors will negotiate directly on less liquid tokens, often achieving higher returns for assuming more risk. The platform will go further by introducing mtTokens, which lenders will receive as proof of their pool share and accrued interest. These mtTokens will not only represent claimable assets but will also be usable for staking in designated smart contracts. Revenues generated by the protocol will be directed toward buying back MUTM from the market, and the repurchased tokens will be distributed as rewards to mtToken stakers. This approach strengthens both long-term demand and community participation. Stablecoin pegged to $1 Another central feature will be its decentralized stablecoin pegged to $1. Unlike traditional fiat-backed stablecoins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s design ensures that this asset will only be minted against collateral like ETH. When borrowers repay or when liquidations occur, the stablecoin supply will be burned, keeping circulation under tight control. Governance will adjust interest rates to keep the peg aligned with $1. For instance, rates will rise if the token drifts below $1 and decrease if it trades above. Arbitrage traders will also help stabilize its value through profit-seeking trades. By combining overcollateralization, issuer caps, and automatic liquidations, the stablecoin system will remain robust. This framework will be supported by a strong price discovery mechanism. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will rely on Chainlink’s widely trusted data feeds for real-time pricing, supported by fallback oracles and aggregated feeds for redundancy. In cases of high liquidity, time-weighted averages from decentralized exchanges will serve as additional validation. This system will ensure that collateral values, liquidations, and loan limits are calculated with precision, keeping the platform solvent and transparent. Roadmap execution and security standards The roadmap of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been carefully staged across four phases. Phase 1 has already brought the initiation of the presale, an AI-powered helpdesk, external audits, listing on major tracking platforms, and marketing campaigns that fueled community growth. The giveaway campaign also began during this period, with $100,000 set aside for distribution to ten winners. Phase 2 will involve building the foundation through core smart contract development, DApp front-end and back-end progress, advanced feature integration, and regular code reviews by both internal and external auditors. Risk parameters and analytics tools will also be implemented during this phase. Phase 3 will finalize the platform, bringing testnet beta releases, exchange listing preparation, and extensive security checks with multiple external firms. The conclusion of the presale will also mark a major milestone here. Phase 4 will deliver the live launch, MUTM token listings, activation of the claim process, bug bounty programs, regional compliance efforts, institutional partnerships, and expansion across multiple blockchains. Investor confidence is further supported by security benchmarks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already secured a CertiK audit with a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79. The audit request was placed on February 25, 2025, and revised on May 20, 2025. Alongside this, a bug bounty program worth 50,000 USDT will reward community members who identify vulnerabilities. Critical findings are eligible for up to $2,000, major up to $1,000, medium up to $500, and low up to $200. Security, governance, and community incentives all work together to make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a project that will last and develop. Analysts think that the presale momentum will push MUTM above $0.040 in the next few days. In the long term, beta launch, listings, staking rewards, and stablecoin acceptance are expected to push valuations even higher. If you’re curious about why crypto is down today, the presale data shows that money isn’t fleeing the market; it’s just being shifted to projects that will be worth more in the long term. As Phase 6 draws to a finish, the discounted entrance price of $0.035 is quickly coming to an end. Investors who act quickly will get a 15% gain to $0.040.

More than 16,750 holders have joined, and 55% of the 170 million tokens allocated to Phase 6 are already sold. The token’s total supply will be 4 billion, and Phase 7 will set the price at $0.040, a 15% step up that will close this entry window for many retail buyers. Early participants who entered at $0.01 are already 3.5× on paper, showing how early allocations will gain as the market rotates from BTC and ETH toward high-utility altcoins. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned to lead Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will combine a two-tier lending system with staking mechanics and a revenue-driven buyback model that creates ongoing demand for MUTM. Peer-to-Contract pools will let users supply well-known assets—stablecoins and blue-chip tokens—into audited smart contracts that adjust rates by utilization. Peer-to-Peer markets will isolate higher-volatility tokens, preserving the safety of the main pools while offering higher yields for specialized lenders. Depositors will receive mtTokens representing their share and accrued interest; mtTokens will also be usable as collateral and stakeable in designated contracts to earn MUTM distributions. A distinct selling angle for this cycle is Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE). ECE will permit improved borrowing limits when collateral and borrowed assets are closely correlated—especially useful for stablecoin pairs—so capital will work harder without raising systemic risk. For example, a user who deposits $9,000 in USDT into a P2C pool earning an average 14% APY will see about $1,260 of passive yield over a year while holding mtUSDT that can be staked for extra rewards. Borrowers will access liquidity without selling exposure: a trader posting $3,000 in SOL as collateral will be able to borrow up to $2,250 under typical LTV rules. These mechanics will let active users leverage positions, drive platform volume, and feed the revenue loop that funds buybacks. Stability and a mint-on-borrow stablecoin will add another layer of demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a decentralized $1 stablecoin that will be minted only against approved collateral and burned on repayment or liquidation. Governance-controlled borrowing rates will be used as a stabilization tool: rates will rise to tighten supply when the stablecoin trades below peg and fall to encourage issuance when it trades above. That combination of protocol controls and market arbitrage will support reliable on-chain dollar activity, attracting traders who need predictable liquidity tools. Price discovery, liquidity management, and catalysts for a 700% move Accurate pricing will be central to safe liquidations and confident capital flows. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will rely on Chainlink feeds as primary oracles, supported by fallback or aggregated sources and DEX time-weighted averages where on-chain liquidity allows. This layered approach will reduce manipulation risk and keep collateral valuations transparent. Liquidity-aware liquidation incentives and conservative reserve factors will help ensure that stressed positions can be closed with minimal disruption, making the platform attractive to larger liquidity providers. The pathway for a dramatic price move will be built from several concrete drivers. First, the beta launch timed with listing will let real users test borrowing, staking, and the stablecoin, converting speculative holders into active participants. Second, planned Layer-2 integration will lower transaction costs and increase throughput, unlocking retail and micro-borrowing use cases that are uneconomical on Layer-1. Third, revenue allocation rules will send protocol earnings into open-market buybacks and distributions to stakers, creating ongoing MUTM demand tied to usage rather than hype. Finally, preparatory work for Tier-1 exchange listings will provide visibility and liquidity that amplify price discovery. Taken together, these levers will turn increased platform activity into sustained MUTM demand, which is the logical foundation for large percentage rallies once rotation flows arrive. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already prioritized safety and community incentives to support this growth path. The project will present a CertiK audit with a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79, a $50,000 bug bounty program with tiered rewards, and a $100,000 giveaway rewarding early supporters. Its analytics dashboard and Top 50 leaderboard are already live, giving investors real-time ROI tools and social incentives. With these elements, investors who study crypto prices and seek disciplined exposure to altcycle gains will find Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a structured outcome of modern DeFi design. As money moves away from BTC and ETH, protocols with actual demand mechanisms will become more important. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has everything traders need to find the next 700% rise this season: a product-market fit, solid security, buyback-driven rewards, and an execution plan that will turn presale demand into real platform use. The closing Phase 6 window at $0.035 will be an important time for people who are contemplating how to divide up their crypto investments before altseason picks up speed.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being highlighted by research desks as one of the strongest challengers in the DeFi dynamics, with forecasts of 25x returns by mid-2026 based on its structure of stable interest mechanisms, overcollateralized loans, and revenue-powered buybacks. For investors asking why crypto is down today while searching for fresh growth opportunities, the current presale is offering an entry point before demand accelerates further. Why ETH comparisons are growing louder At present, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale, where the token is priced at $0.035. More than $16.7 million has been raised, with 55% of the $170 million allocation already secured by over 16,750 holders. The upcoming Phase 7 will lift the price to $0.040, representing a 15% jump. Early participants in Phase 1, who bought at $0.01, already hold tokens valued at 3.5X their entry, while Phase 5 buyers at $0.03 are also comfortably in profit. With 4 billion tokens in total supply and presale demand running strong, Phase 6 represents the final window before the next pricing milestone. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing ETH-style comparisons because of its long-term architecture rather than short-term speculation. Its Stable Interest Rate Model gives borrowers predictability. Rates are initially higher than variable options, but rebalancing rules will ensure sustainability if market conditions swing. This allows borrowers to plan without exposure to sudden shocks, which strengthens overall adoption. System solvency is guaranteed by overcollateralization. Loans are structured so that assets posted as collateral always outweigh the amount borrowed, with liquidation mechanisms activating automatically if thresholds are breached. Arbitrageurs will be incentivized to step in during liquidations, reinforcing pool health. Ethereum pioneered this concept of trustless collateral, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is optimizing it with strict loan-to-value (LTV) rules and clear liquidation thresholds. The lending design further strengthens investor confidence. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools will support stablecoins and blue-chip crypto coins like ETH and BTC. Depositors supplying $10,000 USDT into a pool will earn around $1,500 annually through mtUSDT, which represents both their deposit and interest accrual. On the other side, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending will focus on tokens outside the top bracket, including SHIB and FLOKI. This separation gives yield hunters options while ensuring core pools remain insulated from higher-risk assets. The platform also integrates staking with mtTokens, which are issued to depositors. These mtTokens can be locked in staking contracts to earn MUTM rewards. Platform revenue will be directed toward open-market buybacks of MUTM, and repurchased tokens will be distributed to stakers, creating a continuous cycle of engagement and reinforcement for the ecosystem. Security, governance, and the ROI case Governance and safety are critical to any DeFi protocol, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already laid its foundation. A CertiK audit of the MUTM token has been completed, producing a Token Scan Score of 90.00 and a Skynet Score of 79.00. Security will continue to be incentivized by a $50,000 bug bounty pool, rewarding contributions from white-hat hackers. Alongside this, the community is being energized through a $100,000 giveaway in which ten winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM each. With more than 12,000 social media followers already engaged, the project is capturing traction far beyond its presale stage. It’s getting harder to ignore the ROI story. An investor who put $5,000 into Phase 1 got tokens that are now worth $17,500 in Phase 6. Analysts think that the same investment might be worth more than $125,000 in less than two years if it grows at a rate of 25X its current value. Everyone is saying that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the best alternative to ETH for anyone who wants to make a lot of money. As markets deal with ups and downs and investors try to figure out why crypto is down today, the presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shows that momentum is moving in a different direction. The price of $0.035 will shortly give way to $0.040, as Phase 6 is already more than halfway sold. For investors looking for the next big thing, the chance to get in on ETH-like growth patterns is already happening in real time.

(AVAT), a digital asset treasury firm backed by the Avalanche Foundation, will go public through a $675 million merger with Mountain Lake Acquisition Corp. (MLAC), aiming to build over $1 billion worth of AVAX tokens in its treasury. The agreement brings around $640 million in treasury assets and creates one of the largest public offerings for AVAX exposure . The new company is expected to be listed on Nasdaq in the first quarter of 2026, subject to approval by regulators and shareholders. AVAT signs a $675M merger with Mountain Lake MLAC is listed on Nasdaq as a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) because its sole purpose is to merge with or acquire another business, allowing the new business to join the stock market more easily. According to the company, it sold shares to private investors and raised about $460 million in treasury assets to support the new company after the merger. This large pool of capital is meant for Avalanche Treasury Co. to hold and manage AVAX on behalf of large investors. Avalanche Treasury Co. will also be able to buy $200 million worth of AVAX tokens at a discount through the partnership. What’s more, AVAT will have the first right to buy more tokens directly from the Foundation whenever it needs them for the next eighteen months. It means AVAT investors may be able to get cheaper access to AVAX compared to buying tokens directly, buying into AVAX exposure at a 0.77 times net asset value multiple, which is a 20% discount compared to the normal price. The public listing strengthens Avalanche Treasury and grows the AVAX AVAT aims to utilize these tokens in projects and provide investors with a clear path to generate value. The company plans to focus on three key areas, including protocol investment , where AVAT will support major components of the Avalanche blockchain. The second area involves working with large businesses that develop tokens, such as stablecoins, and platforms that integrate real-world assets, including property or financial products, onto the Avalanche blockchain.

A $1,000 stake in Ethereum (ETH)’s early days eventually scaled to $1 million as crypto prices surged through a historic 1,000x run. Now, retail investors are asking the same question: which project today shows the same combination of vision, timing, and momentum to repeat such a story? Increasingly, attention is shifting toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi protocol that is entering its presale with an already powerful track record of traction and adoption. ETH’s outlook Ethereum (ETH) is currently holding firm around $4,200, which many analysts view as a critical battleground zone. The recent price action shows buyers defending this area even as sellers resist any upward push. On‐chain data supports this tension: ETH reserves on exchanges continue to drop, suggesting accumulation by longer-term holders and reduced selling pressure. However, reclaiming the $4,200 level is not enough on its own — to build further upside momentum, ETH may need to break through overhead supply zones (e.g. ~$4,250–$4,300) and trigger short‐squeeze dynamics. If that fails, ETH could slip toward support ranges near $3,800–$3,900. MUTM presale marks the entry point Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035. Over 55% of this phase has already sold out, with more than $16.7 million raised and a holder base that now exceeds 16,750 wallets. With total supply capped at 4 billion tokens, it is already beginning to play a role as momentum builds. Once Phase 7 launches, the price will increase by 15% to $0.040, setting a higher entry cost for new investors. Those who positioned themselves during Phase 1 at just $0.01 have already secured a 250% value gain before the token has even hit exchanges. That trajectory mirrors the kind of presale compounding that Ethereum (ETH) enjoyed in its early cycle and explains why retail enthusiasm is intensifying around this project. For investors exploring new crypto investment opportunities, MUTM presents a rare mix of affordability and structured growth potential. To illustrate, a $2,000 purchase at the current price secures around 57,000 MUTM tokens. Even at a conservative 25x projection by 2026, this position grows to over $50,000. With early phases showing consistent price progression, late entry will cost buyers more for the same upside exposure. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being called Ethereum (ETH)’s successor What gives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) its strong narrative is not just the presale activity but the fundamentals backing its ecosystem. The platform integrates decentralized stablecoin lending, advanced overcollateralization mechanics, and yield generation through mtToken staking. This combination directly addresses gaps that earlier DeFi protocols left unresolved. The stablecoin model ensures every minted unit is backed by overcollateralized loans. Once repaid or liquidated, that stablecoin supply is burned, maintaining a strong peg around the dollar. Governance has the ability to adjust borrowing rates to rebalance demand and reinforce the peg, adding a level of adaptability. This structure ensures steady usage of MUTM tokens as collateral across lending markets. Collateralization rules are equally precise. A deposit of ETH, stablecoins, or other approved assets allows borrowing at calculated loan-to-value ratios. If collateral dips below safety thresholds, automated liquidations and discounts for liquidators keep the system stable. Reserve factors provide an additional buffer for volatile market swings, reducing systemic risks for retail participants. For those tracking the crypto fear and greed index, this type of protection appeals in both euphoric and bearish conditions, as investors value clear rules and predictable outcomes. Another innovation is mtTokens. When users deposit into liquidity pools, they receive mtTokens representing their share plus accrued yield. These mtTokens themselves act as collateral and can be staked for additional rewards. Protocol revenue is allocated to buy MUTM tokens on the open market, which are then distributed to mtToken stakers, creating a growth flywheel where activity directly fuels demand for the native token. Risk isolation also matters. The system separates volatile meme tokens like DOGE or PEPE into peer-to-peer lending markets rather than exposing them to the main liquidity pools. This allows retail investors with riskier assets to engage in lending while keeping the core pools stable and reliable for ETH, BTC, and stablecoins. A clear path for long-term growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also reinforces credibility through external validation. The project has completed its CertiK audit with a Token Score of 90.00 and a Skynet Score of 79.00, underlining strong technical quality. A $50,000 bug bounty program adds ongoing community-driven oversight, while a $100,000 giveaway will see 10 winners receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. On top of that, the roadmap is ambitious but clear, with a beta version of the platform scheduled to be available at launch, giving retail investors immediate utility rather than distant promises. For investors who wish they had bought ETH for less than $5, these two situations are very similar. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently trading for only $0.035, and there is already one more presale increase planned. As crypto prices go up and down and news stories wonder which project will lead to the next big growth, our protocol combines the thrill of being an early adopter with the peace of mind that comes from having advanced mechanics, actual value, and audit-backed legitimacy. Many people learned from missing ETH’s early run. MUTM looks like the chance that retail investors have been waiting for, and the window for this low price is closing quickly.

According to Levi, possessing 10,000 XRP is sufficient to enter the top 5% of holders. He further suggested that such a position may present significant financial potential, especially if projections for mass adoption over the next five to ten years materialize. Levi explained that this holding size could, under favorable market conditions, be enough to elevate individuals into millionaire status in the future. XRP HOLDERS YOU ARE RICH ! #XRP pic.twitter.com/fPlpdaXHWf — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) September 30, 2025 Comparison with Reported Data on XRP Distribution The observations align with previously published analysis by crypto proponent John Squire, who provided an extensive breakdown of XRP distribution among accounts. The data shows a highly concentrated ownership structure, with top-tier holders maintaining large amounts of the asset. Specifically, the top 0.01% of accounts reportedly control at least 5.7 million XRP. To reach the 0.1% threshold, an account must hold 369,080 XRP, while 200,099 XRP secures a place within the top 0.2%. Further down the scale, Squire reported that holding 100,000 XRP is enough to place an account within the top 0.5% of investors. This trend of decreasing thresholds illustrates how the distribution narrows quickly as one moves through the rankings, underscoring the weight of large accumulations among a small number of participants. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Entry into Higher Brackets with Lower Holdings Notably, Squire’s analysis highlighted that joining the top 1% requires holding 50,637 XRP, a number that is far below what some might assume is necessary. The thresholds continue to scale downward as percentages broaden, with the top 2% holding 25,639 XRP or more. For investors aiming at wider percentile ranks, only 2,486 XRP is needed to be counted among the top 10%. This perspective reinforces Levi’s point, as it demonstrates how 10,000 XRP comfortably places an individual in an advantageous position relative to the broader investor base. Future Value and Market View Levi’s commentary combines current distribution data with a forward-looking view on adoption. He noted that the growth of XRP’s use in payment systems and other applications could enhance its long-term value proposition. The concentration of holdings in the upper brackets reflects both the strength and limitations of distribution in the ecosystem. While smaller amounts are sufficient to place individuals among leading holders, the significant dominance of top accounts shows the extent to which supply is tightly controlled at the highest levels.

Traders watching the rally in Ethereum (ETH) now examine which platforms combine safety with growth, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing attention as the utility-first contender positioned for exponential upside. The rise of Ethereum (ETH) has sparked interest in DeFi again, making people rethink how they allocate their funds. A lot of people look at crypto charts and prices over time to figure out where the market is going. But the real question is where asymmetric profits will come from. Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Cardano (ADA) each have their own groups of users, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming more popular among traders who want to invest in crypto with a balance of security and high returns. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) has powered into the year with strong gains, solidifying its position as the dominant smart contract platform. Its Layer-2 ecosystem has surged, enabling cheaper and faster execution for decentralized apps. ETH remains a long-term hold as its role in DeFi infrastructure is unmatched. Yet for traders seeking triple- or quadruple-digit returns, Ethereum (ETH)’s sheer market size limits its percentage upside compared to smaller, earlier-stage projects. Ripple (XRP) XRP continues to trade as a narrative-driven asset with attention around regulatory milestones and its use case in remittances. It retains liquidity and adoption within payment corridors but lacks active DeFi traction. While XRP has historically offered sharp rallies, its limited presence in decentralized finance makes it less attractive to those looking for utility-first growth catalysts. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) remains a respected blockchain with a reputation for rigorous research and phased development. Its slower execution on DeFi integrations, however, has held back the level of user activity seen on Ethereum (ETH) and Layer-2 networks. Traders monitoring ADA recognize its potential for steady gains, but its restrained DeFi ecosystem reduces the chance for explosive returns compared to more agile platforms. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the conversation as the pragmatic alternative: a presale-stage DeFi protocol designed to deliver immediate usage upon listing. With Phase 6 priced at $0.035, raising around $16.7M and already 55% of its 170M allocation sold, more than 16,750 holders now align with the project. The total supply of 4B MUTM sets a clear framework for valuation. Audit credibility is anchored by a CertiK review (Token Scan Score 90, Skynet Score 79), and its community strength is reflected in over 12K Twitter followers. A 15% price jump to $0.040 awaits in Phase 7, creating urgency for those still waiting on the sidelines. Unlike XRP and ADA, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is structured with built-in demand loops. In peer-to-contract markets, a depositor supplying $12,000 USDC into mtUSDC at 16% APY generates $1,920 annually, while a borrower posting $2,000 worth of ETH accesses $1,500 stablecoin at 75% LTV. Peer-to-peer lending isolates higher-risk assets, such as a user negotiating terms to lend 100,000 SHIB or a tranche of PEPE for 30 days, with yield opportunities not impacting the safer pools. These mechanics encourage liquidity while protecting core stability. Layer-2 integration means lower transaction costs and higher frequency of use, critical for micro-borrowing and retail adoption. At listing, the beta launch will transition speculative presale holders into active platform users, translating into real TVL, lending activity, and fee generation. These fees support buybacks, while reserve accumulation and enhanced collateral efficiency drive continuous demand for the token. Expected exchange access across platforms like Binance and Coinbase is expected to catalyze liquidity shocks, enhancing price discovery. Security and community are fortified with multiple layers of incentives: a $50K bug bounty program, a $100K giveaway for ten winners of $10K each, and engagement tools such as a dashboard and leaderboard system designed to increase staking activity and long-term participation. Early investment case For example, a confident investor who moved $8,000 from BTC and AVAX to Phase-1 MUTM for $0.01 got 800,000 MUTM. That investment is now worth $28,000 (3.5×) by Phase 6. At $0.06, the same allocation for MUTM goes up to $48,000 (6×). Values range from $0.60 to $1.80 per token, with expected multipliers of 10× to 30× within 12 to 24 months of listing. Layer-2 adoption, stablecoin borrowing volumes, exchange listings, and regular buybacks are all factors that have helped this trend continue. The first $8,000 investment grows to between $480,000 and $1.44 million at those levels, proving MUTM’s claim that it can beat traditional majors with a 100× ROI. Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Cardano (ADA) are still in portfolios, but traders who want both confidence and big growth are putting their money into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) while Phase 6 is still available. The chance to get in at a lower price is getting smaller soon because 55% of its allocation has already been sold, and Phase 7 is priced higher.

Paolo Ardoino says that figure is “a bit bearish” given Tether’s Bitcoin and gold treasury, and the issuer currently has no plans to IPO. Tether valuation estimate: ~$515 billion if public, per Artemis CEO Jon Ma. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino calls that estimate “a bit bearish” while noting substantial Bitcoin and gold reserves. Over 70% of stablecoin transactions in Q3 2025 were linked to bot activity, highlighting AI-stablecoin synergies (CEX.io Research). Tether valuation: Could Tether rival OpenAI’s $500B? Read expert reaction, market-cap comparisons, and implications for AI and stablecoins. What does OpenAI’s $500 billion valuation mean for crypto companies? OpenAI’s $500 billion valuation —driven by a $6.6 billion secondary sale by current and former employees to investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank Group Corp, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX and T. Rowe Price—reframes market comparisons. It highlights the scale gap between top AI startups and the largest crypto firms, while accelerating talk of AI and blockchain convergence. How close is Tether to matching OpenAI’s market cap? At present, public market capitalizations place major crypto firms well below OpenAI’s valuation. Google Finance shows Coinbase around $89 billion. Industry commentary now points to stablecoins—specifically Tether—as the closest private candidate to challenge a $500 billion benchmark if it were public. An estimate from Artemis’s CEO Jon Ma put a potential Tether IPO valuation at about $515 billion. Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, called $515 billion “a beautiful number” but “a bit bearish,” citing Tether’s Bitcoin and gold treasury and stating there is no need to go public. How are AI and stablecoins becoming interconnected? AI and stablecoins are converging as both underpin next-generation digital infrastructure. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz said AI agents will be the biggest users of stablecoins. Research firm CEX.io Research reported that over 70% of stablecoin transactions in Q3 2025 were linked to bot activity, suggesting programmatic demand for stable-value rails. Source: Paolo Ardoino Why do some industry leaders expect AI to drive stablecoin demand? AI agents require low-friction, programmatic settlement for high-frequency operations. Stablecoins offer predictable value and fast transfer times, making them attractive for automated agents and infrastructure providers. Institutional moves—such as Galaxy Digital securing a $1.4 billion loan to develop the Texas Helios AI datacenter—also show capital flows into firms that sit at the intersection of AI compute and crypto payment rails. What risks are associated with rapid AI growth? Several industry voices warn about AI’s energy and safety implications. Akash founder Greg Osuri said, at Token2049 in Singapore, that AI’s power needs may outstrip current grids and suggested nuclear power or decentralized training as solutions. Osuri warned that AI’s expansion could have severe human costs without sustainable approaches. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Tether valuation vs OpenAI: Could a Stablecoin Rival a $500B AI Startup?"", ""description"": ""Tether valuation: Could Tether rival OpenAI’s $500B?

Tether’s reserves—publicly discussed holdings of Bitcoin and gold—are cited by executives as key valuation components. An industry figure estimated a $515 billion market cap if Tether listed, but without an IPO prospectus that valuation remains theoretical. How will bot-linked stablecoin activity affect markets? High bot-linked stablecoin activity (over 70% of transactions in Q3 2025 per CEX.io Research) increases short-term liquidity and programmatic demand, but also raises monitoring and compliance priorities for exchanges and regulators. Key Takeaways Tether valuation momentum : A public Tether could be valued near $515B per one estimate, making it comparable to OpenAI’s $500B. AI-stablecoin synergy : AI agents and bots are already major users of stablecoins, driving transactional demand. Policy and infrastructure impact : Rising AI compute needs and bot activity increase focus on energy, compliance, and the role of stablecoins in financial infrastructure. Conclusion OpenAI’s $500 billion valuation reframes how the market compares large private tech firms and crypto issuers. Tether valuation estimates place it within striking distance of major AI startups if it ever listed, but company leadership currently rejects the need to IPO. The growing overlap between AI agents and stablecoins suggests structural shifts in digital payments and infrastructure, meriting close monitoring by investors, technologists and regulators.",News|BTC|USDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|USDT|MARKET|BTC|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-02 11:48:37

The investment bank also lowered its Bitcoin forecast from $135,000 to $133,000, citing macro factors, such as weaker gold prices and a stronger dollar. At the time of publication, Ethereum was trading at $4,376.55, representing a 5.36% increase for the day. ETH has also increased by more than 72% in the past 12 months. Bitcoin is trading at $118,480, a 3.21% surge in the last 24 hours. BTC is also up 92% in the last 12 months. Citigroup says ETF inflow fuels Ethereum’s momentum Citigroup attributed the growth to Layer-2s, noting that only 30% have passed through Ethereum’s base layer, which has left prices above model estimates. The analysts also noted that the overvaluation could be attributed to strong inflows and the excitement surrounding stablecoins and tokenization . Citigroup analysts also predict that a bull run could push the ETH price above $6,400. They argued that selling pressure amid strong profit booking for Ethereum caused the drop from $4,700 to $4,500. Citigroup also attributed the growth of ETH to the sustained capital flows into U.S.-based spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this year. On-chain data shows that ETH ETFs have attracted nearly $14 billion in net inflows to date. Sosovalue data also shows that ETH spot ETFs recorded a cumulative inflow of $755.22 million in the past week. This month also started with $80 million flowing into Ethereum funds, with September recording roughly $285.74 million in inflows. Farside data revealed that Bitcoin ETFs have attracted more than $58.4 billion in inflows to date. Bitcoin funds also finished Q3 with $7.8 billion in fresh inflows, accumulating $21.5 billion in 2025 alone. Ethereum ETFs await SEC approval to include staking provisions 10x Research’s head of research, Markus Thielen, argued that staking approval for U.S.-listed ETH funds could bring huge inflows of institutional money into Ethereum, and possibly outpace Bitcoin ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyfatt predicted that staking on Ethereum funds will be approved by at least the fourth quarter of 2025. Bitwise CEO, Hunter Horsley, told reporters at Token2049 in Singapore on Thursday that Solana’s staking capabilities may give it an advantage over Ethereum in the race for staking ETFs. He noted that ETH’s staking queue recently reached new highs, while Solana’s clears faster. Horsley believes that the difference is crucial for issuers whose goal is to return assets to investors quickly. “It’s a huge problem. The ETFs need to be able to return assets in a very short time from. So this is a huge challenge.” -Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise. Horsley argued that Ethereum funds can adopt Bitwise’s initiative of using a credit facility to maintain liquidity for redemptions at its Ethereum staking exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe. He also warned that such facilities come at a cost and have capacity constraints. Ethereum and Solana funds are awaiting approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to include staking features in the coming weeks. Firms including Bitwise, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, CoinShares, Grayscale Investments, Canary Capital, and VanEck have all filed amended S-1 documents with the agency to update their existing funds’ staking provisions. On-chain data revealed that Ethereum treasuries control 3.5% of all Ether, while Bitcoin treasuries hold 3.4% of the network’s total supply. Senior research associate at Bitwise, Max Shannon, stated that the percentage of supply accumulated by Ethereum treasuries continues to outpace that of Bitcoin in the short term. Strategic ETH Reserve shows that 71 firms now hold $22 billion in Ether. Bitcoin Treasuries data revealed that about 184 public firms hold over 1 million Bitcoin worth around $116 billion.

CEO Paolo Ardoino revealed in an interview with Bloomberg that the company will promote the token through Rumble, a video platform positioning itself as a rival to YouTube with 51 million monthly users. According to Tether, USAT will comply with U.S. regulatory requirements and will be integrated into a crypto wallet currently being developed by Rumble. Beyond USAT, the wallet is expected to support other stablecoins and tokenized assets such as gold. Tether described this wallet as “the centerpiece” of its expansion into digital assets. A $775 Million Bet on Rumble and the US Market Bloomberg reported that Tether owns 48% of Rumble following a $775 million investment in 2024, giving it significant influence over the platform. Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovsky confirmed the partnership, emphasizing that Rumble represents freedom of speech, while Tether and the decentralized internet embody true financial freedom. The announcement comes as Tether continues to expand its crypto footprint. At the end of Q3, the company also acquired $1 billion worth of Bitcoin, further reinforcing its strategy of diversification and deeper presence in the U.S. market. Rumble recently reported Q2 2025 revenue of $25.1 million , a 12% increase versus the same period last year, even as its monthly active users fell to 51 million, likely due to a seasonal cooling post-election cycle. The company also saw a 24% jump in average revenue per user (ARPU), driven by higher subscription and licensing income.

The prediction market acquired QCX LLC for $112 million in July , securing a Designated Contract Market license that allows it to self-certify markets for U.S. users, including sports and election betting. The breakthrough caps a strategic year that positioned the $2.6 billion platform for rapid U.S. expansion, including high-profile board appointments and massive institutional backing. CEO Shayne Coplan earlier stated that Polymarket “ has been given the green light to go live in the USA ” following the CFTC’s no-action letter issued in September, crediting the Commission for “impressive work” completed in “record timing.” Polymarket was forced to exit the U.S. in January 2022 after regulatory enforcement, agreeing to block American users and pay a $1.4 million civil penalty for operating an unregistered exchange. The platform continued explosive growth overseas despite the ban, processing over $6 billion in bets during the first half of 2025 alone and gaining prominence by accurately predicting Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential victory.

The company is now in discussions to raise new capital that could push its valuation beyond $10 billion, more than tripling the June figure, as it prepares for reentry into the U.S. market. Donald Trump Jr. joined Polymarket’s advisory board in August , as his venture capital firm 1789 Capital invested tens of millions of dollars, expanding the platform’s U.S. political reach. The appointment came shortly after the Department of Justice and CFTC closed their investigations into Polymarket without pursuing further action in July. Polymarket has secured high-profile partnerships, including a collaboration with Elon Musk’s X platform to integrate prediction markets with AI-powered analysis from the xAI chatbot Grok. The platform introduced a 4% annualized yield in September on certain long-term positions in political and geopolitical markets, including the 2028 U.S. presidential race and leadership outcomes in Russia, China, Turkey, Israel, and Ukraine. Blockchain prediction market @Polymarket is preparing a return to the United States as it eyes a potential $10 billion valuation. #Polymarket #Crypto https://t.co/MROvtgwymw — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 13, 2025 Kalshi Dominance Sets Stage for Fierce Market Competition Rival platform Kalshi has dominated U.S. prediction market activity since Polymarket’s 2022 exit, posting higher volumes than Polymarket for three consecutive weeks through September. Kalshi recorded $728 million in trades in one week, nearly 60% higher than Polymarket’s volume and close to Kalshi’s record $749 million during the 2024 presidential election run-up. Data from Dune Analytics shows Kalshi captured 66.13% of total on-chain prediction market volume between September 16 and 22, with more than $854 million in trades and $192 million in open interest. Source: Dune Analytics On the other hand, Polymarket saw $405 million in trading volume and $166 million in open interest over the same period. Kalshi operates as a CFTC-authorized Designated Contract Market, following a 2024 court victory that allowed it to offer contracts on political events. The CFTC initially contested the ruling but later dropped its challenge, giving Kalshi a regulatory advantage. The NFL season kickoff reignited market engagement, with Kalshi processing $441 million in trading volume since Week 1. However, Kalshi faces mounting legal challenges from state regulators. Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell filed a civil lawsuit in September , accusing Kalshi of running unlicensed sports betting disguised as “event contracts.” The suit alleges that between January and June 2025, 70-75% of Kalshi’s $1 billion in wagers came from sports markets, rivaling licensed operators like DraftKings. Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulators issued cease-and-desist orders forcing Kalshi to suspend sports-related contracts in both states. Kalshi filed a lawsuit in March challenging the orders , arguing its contracts fall under CFTC jurisdiction rather than state-level gaming regulation. The company maintains that its event contracts function as two-sided swap markets, unlike traditional sports betting, where the house controls odds. Polymarket still faces restrictions in France, Belgium, Thailand, and Singapore, where authorities have cited gambling law violations. However, the new DCM license enables the platform to legally offer real-money markets to U.S. residents while leveraging self-certified markets to differentiate itself with broader event offerings.

This suggests that long-term holders are building positions as the price climbs, which is often seen as a sign of steady market confidence rather than panic buying or selling. Interestingly, CryptoQuant’s Long-Term Holder SOPR, which measures whether coins are being sold at a profit or loss, is currently reading around 1.8. This means most long-term holders who are selling now are doing so at a profit. Source: CryptoQuant Throughout the year, this metric has stayed above 1.

New Quarter Opens With a Breakout A separate chart from Daan Crypto Trades shows Bitcoin breaking out of a downward trend channel that had held since July. The close at the start of October, near $118,600, marked a clean move above resistance. Daan noted that staying above $112,000 would help keep the trend intact. He also said that the start of a new month and quarter often brings short-term volatility. Still, the broader setup remains in favor of continued strength as long as the price holds above key support.

Funds laundered through Tornado Cash, raising security concerns. Incident may be linked to North Korean hacker groups. SBI Crypto Suffers $21 Million Hack Linked to North Korean Hackers On September 24, 2025, over $21 million in digital assets were withdrawn from addresses associated with the SBI Crypto mining pool, a subsidiary of Japan's SBI Group. The stolen funds included Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash, according to crypto researcher ZachXBT . The stolen assets were first transferred to five ”instant exchangers” and subsequently sent to the cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash. ZachXBT noted that the patterns observed in this incident resemble previous attacks attributed to hacker groups linked to North Korea. However, there is no official confirmation of this yet. SBI Crypto's Background and Recent Developments SBI Crypto has been a leading cryptocurrency mining pool since 2017, offering a platform for miners of all levels. In August 2025, SBI Holdings submitted applications to launch two cryptocurrency ETFs, one of which will invest in Bitcoin and XRP. This breach underscores the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks targeting cryptocurrency infrastructure. North Korean hacker groups, such as the Lazarus Group, have been linked to several high-profile crypto heists in recent years. For instance, in 2024, they were responsible for the $1.3 billion theft from various crypto exchanges, marking one of the largest crypto heists to date. The use of Tornado Cash, a privacy-focused mixer, highlights ongoing challenges in tracking illicit crypto transactions. Despite regulatory efforts, such mixers continue to be utilized for laundering stolen funds, complicating enforcement actions.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BCH|ASIA|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-02 11:59:12

In an October 1 video analysis, Kevin tied an all-time low in the Bollinger Bands Width (BBW) to a long-running pattern across prior cycles and argued that the setup into Q4 leaves “no excuses” for the market not to push higher if key supports hold and the macro backdrop stays benign. Kevin builds his case around two higher-timeframe indicators: the monthly BBW and the monthly RSI. BBW tracks the distance between the Bollinger Bands rather than plotting the bands themselves; compressed width signals historically low realized volatility and the potential for sharp expansion. “We are at the lowest Bollinger Band width we have ever been at in Bitcoin history,” he said, calling it an inflection that has repeatedly aligned with outsized trend moves. He pairs that with a monthly RSI that topped in prior blow-off phases and is currently consolidating in what he describes as a bull-flag structure. “Anytime the Bollinger bandwidth percentage gets as low as it is right now… every single time in history on the monthly time frame, we have experienced massive moves higher in the market,” he argued. To illustrate the cycle rhyme, Kevin pointed to late 2013 and 2017, when monthly RSI peaked around 96 and 95 respectively while BBW expanded into cycle tops after earlier troughs in volatility. In the subsequent bear-market basing phases, he says BBW fell to cycle lows before fresh expansions began. In the most recent cycle run-up, he characterizes Q4 2023 into March 2024 as the “real rally,” noting that RSI topped near 76 and has since been coiling with “lower highs and higher lows on the monthly RSI… very, very nice looking.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Go To $1 Million, Telegram Founder Durov Predicts The analyst underlined a key conditional: the technical structure only resolves bullish if Bitcoin preserves its higher-timeframe support. He cites the weekly “bull market support band” and nearby horizontal levels as the line in the sand. “As long as Bitcoin can hold key levels, that being the weekly bull market support band, which currently sits at 109.2K, [and] the 106.8K level, then there’s no excuses as to why Bitcoin should not be able to press higher in quarter four,” he said. What To Watch Now For Bitcoin Beyond chart structure, Kevin layered in macro and on-chain context as corroborating, not leading, evidence. On macro, his base case is that the policy environment is turning supportive: “We have stable inflation, pretty much flatlined… a weakening jobs market, but not cratering… steady GDP growth, and we have a Fed who’s looking to ease.” Referencing weaker-than-expected ADP employment data and recent FOMC signaling, he added: “We have a rate cut projected for October… for December… and [possibly] January,” and suggested the Fed’s quantitative tightening could approach an end as bank reserves tighten. He was explicit that the path depends on those conditions persisting: “As long as our macroeconomic landscape here in the US remains favorable… the pathway is laid for crypto to go higher in Q4.” On valuation and positioning, Kevin turned to a logarithmic regression model of total crypto market capitalization and a “Bitcoin risk metric.” He said total market cap has not yet exceeded his model’s fair-value trendline this cycle—placing fair value at about $4.38 trillion versus roughly $4 trillion for the current reading in his framework—and argued that previous cycle-defining blow-offs began only after crossing above fair value. Related Reading: Galaxy’s Digital Bitcoin Sales Continue: 1,190 Bitcoin Moves To Binance “Every single time… we finally broke past the fair value logarithmic regression line, you have seen your biggest moves of the cycle,” he said. His risk metric, color-coded from low to high, currently sits near 0.49–0.50 by his count, well below the 0.8–0.9 “red” zone he associates with durable tops. “Not once this entire cycle has Bitcoin hit basically the red risk level,” he noted, adding that monthly RSI near the high-60s/low-70s is “not seeing parabolic price action… not seeing insane euphoria.” Exchange behavior is another pillar of his non-top thesis. In prior cycle peaks, he said, net flows of BTC to exchanges surged as participants prepared to sell. “Not only is that not occurring, but net flows are going off of exchanges,” he said. “That is not cycle top behavior. That is accumulation behavior.” The combination—compressed monthly volatility, consolidating momentum, sub-threshold risk, and outflows—leads him to a single conclusion: “There is major volatility coming. If anything, it’s starting now.” Kevin also acknowledged uncertainties around near-term US economic prints and even government operations, but he returned to the core of his method: synthesizing macro, technicals, and on-chain into a unified cycle view. “We don’t lean in one direction… We put it all together,” he said. Under that blended framework, he contends, calling a cycle top at current levels would “go against every single piece of information we have ever used in the past to determine cycle tops,” and would force a rethink of the model only if the market proves it wrong. The battle lines, in his telling, are clear. Hold the weekly bands around $109.2K and $106.8K, keep the macro trajectory supportive, and the historical pattern of BBW compression resolving in a powerful, final upside leg should play out as Q4 progresses. Or, as Kevin put it in the line that defined his thesis: “Every time this happened, price went vertical.” At press time, BTC traded at $118,811.

52563495,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85055,1759406443,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"5 Best Crypto Apps for Beginners in 2025: Simple, Secure, and User-Friendly",https://timestabloid.com/5-best-crypto-apps-for-beginners-in-2025-simple-secure/,"Entering the cryptocurrency world in 2025 no longer requires technical expertise or tolerance for confusing interfaces. The landscape has transformed dramatically, with a new generation of crypto applications designed specifically for everyday users who want the benefits of digital assets without the complexity. The best crypto app for beginners now eliminates traditional pain points—complicated seed phrases, confusing gas fees, and intimidating trading terminals—replacing them with intuitive experiences that feel as natural as using your favorite mobile apps. Whether you’re interested in sending money globally, exploring decentralized finance, or simply holding stablecoins for daily transactions, choosing the right wallet is crucial. The best crypto wallet for beginners 2025 balances security with simplicity, offering features like biometric authentication, easy onboarding, and clear interfaces. More importantly, these applications maintain self-custody principles, giving you complete control over your assets as a non custodial wallet should, while abstracting away the technical complexities that once made crypto feel inaccessible. This guide examines five standout applications that represent the cutting edge of beginner-friendly crypto experiences. Each offers unique approaches to making digital assets accessible, from seedless security to multi-chain management to social features. Let’s explore what makes these apps essential tools for anyone starting their crypto journey in 2025. 1. Base: The Everything App Built by Coinbase Base (formerly Coinbase Wallet) has evolved beyond a simple wallet into a comprehensive “everything app” that combines social networking, decentralized applications, and financial services in one seamless platform. Built by Coinbase and leveraging the Base Layer 2 blockchain, this application represents the company’s vision for mainstream crypto adoption—making onchain activities as intuitive as using traditional social media. What sets Base apart is its smart wallet technology powered by passkeys, eliminating the need for traditional seed phrase management. Users can sign up in minutes using biometric authentication through Face ID or fingerprint, making it one of the most accessible entry points for beginners. The integration with Coinbase’s broader ecosystem means users can easily fund their wallets via bank transfer or debit card, bridging traditional finance and crypto seamlessly. Key features that beginners will appreciate: Smart wallet with passkey security—no seed phrases to manage or lose Seamless Coinbase integration for easy funding and transfers Multi-chain support including Ethereum, Solana, Base, Optimism, and more Built-in social features for connecting with other users Access to mini-apps and decentralized applications directly in the interface Sponsored gas fees on certain transactions, reducing friction for new users Base excels at onboarding users who are already familiar with Coinbase’s exchange but want to explore self-custody and decentralized applications. The app provides a gentle learning curve with educational resources, clear transaction previews, and an interface that doesn’t overwhelm newcomers with excessive technical information. For users interested in exploring NFTs, gaming, or DeFi protocols, Base offers direct access to these ecosystems without leaving the app. The application’s “everything app” approach means you can trade tokens, collect NFTs, earn yield through DeFi protocols, and chat with friends—all within a single interface. This consolidation eliminates the need for juggling multiple apps and platforms, a significant advantage for beginners still learning to navigate the crypto landscape. With Coinbase’s reputation backing the technology and continued development focused on user experience, Base represents a solid choice for those taking their first steps into self-custodial crypto management. 2. walllet.com: Crypto Made as Simple as Banking walllet.com has emerged as a game-changer by completely eliminating one of crypto’s most significant barriers: the seed phrase. While most wallets still require users to manage complex 12 or 24-word recovery phrases—a single point of failure that has cost countless users their funds—walllet.com takes a revolutionary approach by implementing truly seedless security through biometric authentication and advanced cryptographic techniques. This non custodial wallet is specifically designed for people who want crypto to work like their everyday banking apps. The focus isn’t on pro-trading features or complex DeFi integrations; instead, walllet.com prioritizes daily usability, making it perfect for sending money to friends, paying for goods and services, and managing stablecoins for real-world transactions. The interface is clean, uncluttered, and deliberately simple—you won’t find complicated charts, advanced trading options, or intimidating technical jargon. What makes walllet.com ideal for beginners: Completely seedless design with biometric security—Face ID or fingerprint is all you need Optimized for stablecoin transactions and daily payments Simple, banking-app-like interface that anyone can understand immediately Fast setup process taking just minutes without complicated backup procedures Perfect for international money transfers and everyday crypto spending No overwhelming trading features—just straightforward send, receive, and manage functionality The genius of walllet.com lies in what it doesn’t include. By consciously avoiding the feature bloat that makes many crypto wallets intimidating, it creates an experience that feels familiar and safe to complete beginners. This makes it an excellent first wallet for people who simply want to hold some USDC for international transactions, receive payments in crypto, or dip their toes into digital assets without committing to learning complex concepts like gas optimization or cross-chain bridges. Security remains uncompromised despite the simplified approach. walllet.com leverages Apple’s Secure Enclave and similar biometric security features, meaning your funds are protected by the same technology that secures your iPhone. This approach proves that beginner-friendly doesn’t have to mean less secure. For users who’ve been hesitant to enter crypto specifically because they fear losing access through a misplaced seed phrase, walllet.com offers a genuine solution that removes this anxiety entirely. Whether you’re receiving your first crypto payment, sending money internationally at a fraction of traditional costs, or simply exploring stablecoins as an alternative to traditional savings, walllet.com provides the most frictionless entry point into the crypto ecosystem available in 2025. 3. Ctrl: Your Gateway to Multi-Chain Crypto Ctrl Wallet (formerly XDEFI) positions itself as “the world’s most powerful crypto wallet,” and for beginners ready to explore beyond a single blockchain, this claim holds substantial merit. Supporting over 2,300 blockchains including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, THORChain, and virtually every EVM-compatible network, Ctrl eliminates the need to juggle multiple wallets for different chains—a common pain point that often overwhelms newcomers. The wallet’s standout innovation is the Gas Tank feature, which solves one of crypto’s most frustrating user experience problems: managing native tokens for gas fees across different blockchains. Instead of needing to hold ETH on Ethereum, BNB on Binance Smart Chain, AVAX on Avalanche, and so on, users simply deposit USDC or CTRL tokens into their Gas Tank, and the wallet automatically handles gas payments across all supported chains. This single feature dramatically simplifies the multi-chain experience for beginners. Ctrl’s beginner-friendly features include: Support for 2,300+ blockchains—manage everything in one place Gas Tank technology—pay fees across all chains with a single USDC balance Social login options with Google or email—no immediate need for seed phrase management Unified portfolio view showing all assets across all chains in one dashboard Automatic detection of forgotten assets when importing existing wallets Built-in cross-chain swap functionality without leaving the wallet Onboarding is remarkably quick; users can set up a Ctrl wallet in under 15 seconds using social logins, making it accessible even to those intimidated by traditional crypto wallet setup processes. The wallet also excels at helping users migrate from other wallets like MetaMask or Phantom, automatically detecting and consolidating all linked accounts—a feature particularly valuable for users who may have experimented with crypto previously and forgotten about small balances across various chains. While Ctrl’s comprehensive feature set might initially seem overwhelming, the interface does an admirable job of presenting this complexity in digestible ways. The unified portfolio view provides clarity on your complete crypto holdings, while the wallet intelligently routes transactions through optimal providers to ensure competitive rates on swaps. Security remains paramount, with the wallet having undergone rigorous audits by FYEO and operating for over four years without major incidents. For beginners who’ve outgrown single-chain solutions or who know they’ll eventually want to explore different blockchain ecosystems, Ctrl represents an excellent choice. It grows with you, offering simple enough onboarding for true beginners while providing the advanced multi-chain capabilities that more experienced users demand. The Gas Tank feature alone justifies considering Ctrl, as it removes one of the most confusing aspects of managing assets across multiple blockchains. 4. Family: Where Design Meets Self-Custody Family, created by Avara (the company behind Aave and Lens Protocol), represents what happens when world-class product design meets cryptocurrency. Available exclusively on iOS, this Ethereum wallet has garnered widespread praise from both crypto natives and design enthusiasts for its stunning interface, thoughtful micro-interactions, and attention to detail that makes every action feel delightful rather than transactional. What immediately distinguishes Family is its approach to the traditional seed phrase problem. Rather than eliminating seed phrases entirely like some competitors, Family enhances them with innovative backup solutions including iCloud integration and their proprietary Family Account system. This allows users to maintain true self-custody while benefiting from familiar recovery mechanisms that feel as secure as recovering any other important app. Family’s distinctive features for beginners: Exceptional UI/UX that makes crypto feel intuitive and enjoyable iCloud backup integration for hassle-free wallet recovery Built-in messaging with other crypto users, complete with the ability to send assets in chat Rich media support for NFTs—view art, play videos, listen to music in-wallet Refuel Wallet feature for quick bridging from Ethereum to L2s like Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum Clean transaction history with human-readable activity logs Organizational tools to star favorite assets and manage collections The attention to detail extends beyond aesthetics. Family includes practical features like real-time transaction tracking with detailed status updates, seamless animations between states, and clear explanations of network fees. The in-app browser allows users to connect to decentralized applications while maintaining the beautiful interface, and the wallet scanner feature enables easy pairing with desktop dApps. Family particularly shines for users interested in the creative side of crypto—NFT collectors, digital art enthusiasts, and those exploring blockchain-based creativity. The rich media support means you can truly appreciate your digital collectibles within the wallet, while the built-in messaging creates a social layer that makes crypto feel less isolating for newcomers. Being able to send a friend some ETH or an NFT directly in a chat conversation bridges the gap between social apps and financial tools in a genuinely useful way. For iPhone users seeking a beginner-friendly wallet that doesn’t compromise on design quality or advanced features, Family represents an outstanding choice. It proves that non custodial crypto wallets can be both secure and delightful to use, challenging the notion that self-custody must involve clunky interfaces and confusing flows. The wallet is backed by Avara’s strong reputation in DeFi, providing additional confidence for users entrusting their assets to the platform. 5. Ready: Smart Wallets for the DeFi-Curious Ready (formerly Argent and Argent X) brings smart wallet technology to beginners with a focus on making DeFi accessible without sacrificing security. With over 2 million downloads and a specialization in Starknet (an Ethereum Layer 2), Ready demonstrates how Account Abstraction can transform the crypto user experience by eliminating traditional pain points while opening doors to yield-generating opportunities. The wallet’s smart contract architecture enables features impossible with traditional wallets. Built-in 2FA adds an extra security layer beyond just your seed phrase, while features like multicall allow bundling several transactions into one, saving both time and gas fees. For beginners worried about security, Ready’s fraud protection system monitors transactions in real-time, alerting users to suspicious activity without compromising self-custody. Ready’s beginner-friendly innovations: Built-in 2FA for enhanced security beyond traditional seed phrases No seed phrase requirement for the mobile app version—uses iCloud/Google Cloud encryption Integrated DeFi protocols for easy staking and yield farming Transaction batching (multicall) to save on fees and simplify complex operations Session keys for gaming—let games sign transactions without constant approvals Ultra-low transaction costs (often under $0.01) thanks to Starknet efficiency Customer support from real humans, not just chatbots What makes Ready particularly interesting for beginners is its dual nature. The mobile app (Ready) offers a streamlined, bank-like experience complete with a crypto debit card for real-world spending, cashback rewards, and high-yield savings options. Meanwhile, Ready Wallet (the browser extension) caters to users who want deeper engagement with DeFi protocols and dApps. This flexibility allows users to start simple and progressively explore more advanced features at their own pace. The integration of practical features like the Ready Card—allowing you to spend crypto at any Mastercard-accepting merchant worldwide with no foreign exchange fees—bridges the gap between crypto holdings and real-world utility. Combined with built-in staking for ETH, STRK, and Bitcoin, Ready enables beginners to put their assets to work earning yield without navigating external DeFi protocols. Security infrastructure is battle-tested, with major exchanges like Binance, Kraken, and OKX trusting Ready’s smart contracts to secure millions in crypto. The wallet’s longevity (pioneering smart wallets since 2017 as Argent) provides confidence that the team understands both security and user experience. For beginners specifically interested in exploring DeFi opportunities while maintaining simplicity, Ready offers an ideal balance—powerful enough for experienced users yet accessible enough for newcomers ready to learn about staking, lending, and other yield strategies. What Makes a Non Custodial Wallet Beginner-Friendly? The phrase “non custodial wallet” refers to wallets where only you control your private keys—no company can access, freeze, or lose your funds. While this self-custody is crypto’s superpower, it traditionally came with steep learning curves. In 2025, the best crypto wallet for beginners successfully combines non-custodial principles with user experience innovations that remove traditional barriers. The key breakthrough has been separating custody from complexity. Modern beginner-friendly wallets achieve this through various approaches: biometric security replacing seed phrase memorization, social recovery mechanisms that don’t compromise self-custody, smart contract wallets that bundle transactions, and Account Abstraction enabling features like paying gas fees in any token. These innovations mean new users can experience true asset ownership without needing to understand cryptographic concepts or blockchain architecture. Additionally, non-custodial doesn’t mean alone. The best beginner wallets provide excellent customer support, clear educational resources, and fraud protection systems that monitor transactions without controlling them. Features like transaction simulations show you exactly what a transaction will do before you approve it, while address book functionality and recent contact lists reduce the risk of sending funds to wrong addresses. This combination of true self-custody with thoughtful user experience represents the maturity of crypto wallet design in 2025. Key Features to Look for in the Best Crypto App for Beginners When selecting the best crypto app for beginners, several features separate genuinely accessible wallets from those merely claiming simplicity. First, onboarding speed matters—if setup takes more than five minutes or requires understanding technical terminology, it’s not truly beginner-friendly. Look for wallets offering social logins, biometric authentication, or automatic cloud backups that eliminate the immediate burden of seed phrase management. Transaction clarity is equally crucial. The best apps show you exactly what you’re sending, to whom, and how much it will cost in terms you understand—preferably your local currency. Real-time transaction tracking, clear confirmation states, and human-readable transaction history help demystify blockchain operations. Additionally, built-in token swaps, straightforward interfaces for buying crypto with fiat currency, and low-fee networks (or fee abstraction features) remove common friction points that frustrate newcomers. Security features should protect without overwhelming. Rather than exposing users to raw private keys and complex backup procedures, modern beginner apps use device-level security (Secure Enclave, biometrics), optional 2FA, fraud detection systems, and transaction simulation tools. Support matters too—responsive customer service from real humans, not just FAQ pages, can make the difference between a user overcoming a problem and abandoning crypto entirely. The best crypto wallet for beginners 2025 balances all these elements, creating an experience where security and simplicity complement rather than contradict each other. Security vs. Simplicity: Finding the Right Balance The traditional narrative claimed crypto users must choose between maximum security (hardware wallets with complex procedures) and convenience (custodial exchanges where companies control your funds). However, 2025’s leading beginner-focused wallets demolish this false dichotomy. Through innovative approaches like Account Abstraction, passkey security, multi-party computation, and smart contract wallets, it’s now possible to have both robust security and delightful user experience. The secret lies in separating security mechanisms from user-facing complexity. When walllet.com eliminates seed phrases using biometric authentication, security doesn’t decrease—it actually improves by removing the single point of failure (a piece of paper or screenshot). Similarly, when Ctrl’s Gas Tank abstracts away multi-chain gas management, users aren’t sacrificing control; they’re simply using a more elegant interface to the same underlying self-custody principles. Smart wallets from Ready and Base use audited smart contracts to enable features like social recovery and 2FA without requiring users to understand the cryptographic implementations. For beginners, the practical advice is to prioritize wallets from reputable teams with proven track records (like Family from Avara, or Base from Coinbase), seek wallets that have undergone security audits, and ensure any simplification features don’t compromise the fundamental principle of self-custody. The right wallet for you depends on your specific needs: if seed phrase anxiety is your biggest barrier, seedless options exist; if you want maximum control, traditional seed-phrase-based wallets with enhanced backup options work better. The key insight is that in 2025, you no longer need to sacrifice security for simplicity—the best wallets offer both. Conclusion: Your Crypto Journey Starts Here The crypto landscape of 2025 offers unprecedented accessibility for beginners, with wallets that eliminate traditional barriers while maintaining the security and self-custody principles that make cryptocurrency revolutionary. Whether you choose walllet.com’s seedless simplicity, Base’s comprehensive everything-app approach, Ctrl’s multi-chain power, Family’s design excellence, or Ready’s DeFi integration, you’re accessing tools that previous generations of crypto users could only dream about. The best crypto app for beginners ultimately depends on your specific needs and comfort level. Start with whichever wallet resonates with your primary use case—international payments, NFT collecting, yield farming, or simply exploring—and remember that you can always expand to additional wallets as you grow more comfortable. The beauty of non custodial solutions is that your assets remain under your control, allowing you to experiment with different tools while maintaining ownership. As you begin your crypto journey, take time to understand each wallet’s recovery mechanisms, start with small amounts while learning, and explore the educational resources these platforms provide. The future of finance is increasingly onchain, and with these beginner-friendly tools, that future is now accessible to everyone.

Key Takeaways: Telegram Wallet will launch tokenized U.S. stocks through a partnership with Kraken and Backed. The rollout starts in October with 35 assets and will prioritize emerging markets. Support will expand to TON Wallet by late 2025, marking a broader push into tokenized finance. The collaboration will bring over 60 tokenized versions of publicly traded companies, including MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Nvidia (NVDA), to Telegram’s third-party wallet platform. Announced Wednesday, the rollout will begin in select markets , with a focus on testing user experience and regulatory compliance. Telegram Wallet to Launch “Stocks and ETFs” Section in October Wallet in Telegram said it plans to introduce the service under a new “Stocks and ETFs” section starting in October. The initial launch will feature 35 tokenized assets, including tokenized versions of Coinbase (COINX), Circle (CRCLX), Robinhood (HOODX), and TON Strategy (TONx). While the offering avoids Bitcoin ETFs, it represents a broader push to bring real-world financial products to blockchain-powered platforms. Backed, which specializes in tokenization for emerging economies, is leading the infrastructure behind xStocks. As such, Wallet in Telegram’s stock integration will prioritize emerging markets in the first phase of the rollout. The platform did not confirm which countries will be eligible at launch. While similar integrations from firms like Alchemy Pay have restricted U.S. users and sanctioned regions, they have provided access to over 170 countries globally. It remains unclear whether this new partnership will adopt a similar model.

XRP Endgame Isn’t Theory Anymore,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-president-just-cracked-the-code-xrp-endgame-isnt-theory-anymore/,"The crypto industry is no stranger to bold predictions, but every so often, a statement surfaces that forces the community to pay closer attention. This week, Ripple found itself at the center of such a moment after a viral clip shared by Ripple Bull Winkle reignited debate about XRP’s ultimate role in global finance. The conversation has shifted: this is no longer about theory but about a playbook that appears to be already in motion. Ripple Bull Winkle’s Viral Post In his post on X, Ripple Bull Winkle wrote: “Ripple’s President just cracked the code. The XRP endgame isn’t theory anymore — it’s on record. The rails are built. The switch is ready. Most will wake up too late.” The accompanying clip featured comments attributed to Ripple President Monica Long , where she reportedly stated: “If just one percent of global payment infrastructure goes on chain, XRP’s gonna take it all.” Ripple’s President just cracked the code. The $XRP endgame isn’t theory anymore — it’s on record. The rails are built. The switch is ready. Most will wake up too late pic.twitter.com/2YwzyobX01 — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 1, 2025 Bull Winkle urged the XRP army to consider the scale of such a shift, adding: “Everyone think about that — this 1%, trillions of dollars moving through Visa, SWIFT, central banks now combining.” He went further, framing XRP as uniquely positioned: “XRP is the only crypto with U.S. regulatory clarity. ETFs are about to open institutional trillions , and Ripple, well they’re sitting in the middle of global finance negotiations.” Finally, he raised a provocative point: “Here’s a little conspiracy twist on it: what if they’re just downplaying it and it’s never been about one percent? Because XRP is designed to win it all. … They are soft launching the new world reserve.” Monica Long’s Public Statements To put Bull Winkle’s interpretation in context, it’s important to look at Monica Long’s actual public remarks. Long has consistently explained XRP’s fundamental role as the native asset of the XRP Ledger , required for transaction fees and account reserves. She has also highlighted its role in liquidity provisioning, noting how XRP can act as a bridge between trading pairs to lower costs and improve efficiency. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 On Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , Long described its expansion as “imminent” and positioned it as a crucial piece of Ripple’s payments strategy. Following Ripple’s acquisition of stablecoin platform Rail, she stated: “As regulations become more clear, the opportunity for stablecoin payments is really ripe, and the acquisition of Rail just really solidifies our market leadership in stablecoin payments.” At the same time, Long has tempered market speculation. In a CNBC interview, she confirmed that Ripple does not plan to go public in 2025, explaining that the company has sufficient resources and no immediate need to raise outside capital. Interpretation vs. Official Messaging Bull Winkle’s post transforms Long’s measured comments into an expansive thesis about XRP’s destiny. While Long has carefully outlined XRP’s utility, regulatory clarity, and the growth of stablecoin infrastructure, Bull Winkle interprets these developments as evidence of an imminent systemic shift. In his framing, the “one percent” of global payments referenced in the clip is not the ceiling but the entry point — a prelude to XRP becoming central to global finance. Long’s actual remarks emphasize technology and strategy; Bull Winkle connects them into a sweeping endgame narrative that resonates with XRP’s most ardent supporters. The Bigger Picture Ripple today stands at a crossroads of legal clarity, institutional interest , and ongoing product expansion. Whether XRP truly evolves into the backbone of global payments remains to be seen. But one fact is clear: the foundation is stronger than ever. Ripple’s president has outlined the tools; Ripple Bull Winkle has painted the vision. And if that vision proves accurate, the world may only realize the scale of it once the switch is already flipped.

Exchanges Can’t Keep Up With Surging Withdrawals,https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-supply-crisis-exchanges-cant-keep-up-with-surging-withdrawals/,"Ethereum (ETH) briefly surged above $4,400 on Thursday, after a 3% gain over the past 24 hours. Despite intense volatility, September 2025 closed on a strong note. With markets cautiously optimistic entering October, Ethereum now finds itself in conditions that could set the stage for a significant bullish breakout. ETH Supply Crunch Alert For the first time in history, Ethereum (ETH) is leaving exchanges faster than they can accumulate it. This has created an “aggressive” supply squeeze. Recent data shared by Alphractal shows billions of dollars’ worth of ETH have flowed out of trading platforms, whether measured in netflow or USD value. The Exchange Flux Balance has turned negative for the first time ever. This metric tracks cumulative netflow. Historically, high values mean exchanges were stockpiling ETH as inflows exceeded outflows, but the current negative reading shows that exchanges can no longer keep up with withdrawals. This points to surging demand from both institutional and retail investors, which is indicative of the strongest market-maker interest in Ethereum ever recorded. The available supply shrinking on exchanges could potentially set the stage for a significant price rally. If this trend continues, ETH could face a historic supply-driven upside, as scarcity on exchanges amplifies buying pressure across the crypto market. Analysts Predict Parabolic Run As Ethereum reclaimed a major support level of $4,250 and surged past it, the next important milestones stand at $4,500 and $4,750 before a potential new all-time high. However, a break below $4,250 could push ETH down toward $4,000, according to market expert Ted Pillows’ observation. Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe said that he expects strong outperformance from Ethereum in the coming weeks. He anticipates Bitcoin to initially bounce, then correct slightly, while ETH gains momentum, which could potentially lead to a broader rally across the entire crypto ecosystem, supported by the BTC pair holding steady. Another pseudonymous researcher ‘EtherNasyonaL’ noted that Ethereum appears poised for a major upward move, as the cryptocurrency is showing patterns consistent with prior market cycles. Historically, ETH has followed a three-step trajectory: breaking major resistance, undergoing a running retest, and then entering a parabolic rally. They note that the market is now in the third cycle, and ETH has once again tested the same critical horizontal support level seen in previous cycles. In both these instances, this pattern was followed by a sharp, parabolic price surge. The post Ethereum Supply Crisis?

At the same time, the country’s economy has been hit hard by Trump’s higher tariffs on Swiss products. According to data released by Switzerland’s statistics office on Thursday, October 2, consumer prices rose 0.2% year-on-year, matching August’s increase. A subsequent survey revealed that out of 15 economists polled, only three had anticipated this stable trend. Switzerland’s inflation level remains a serious concern in the country Switzerland’s inflation level has raised tensions among its citizens, and some anticipate that this outcome might prompt officials at the Swiss National Bank to consider further interest rate cuts. Notably, the officials have already reduced their interest rate to zero. This update was effected after the officials decided not to reduce it into negative territory again to safeguard the financial system last week. Despite these efforts, some economists still hold on to the belief that this could happen at their upcoming December meeting. Meanwhile, the current inflation figures are adding more pressure on the central bank, which is preparing itself for the full impact of the US tariffs on Switzerland. This follows US President Donald Trump’s additional tariff policies on branded medicines in September after imposing a 39% tax on most Swiss products. Jean Dalbard, European economist at Bloomberg Economics, commented on the topic of discussion. Dalbard said they expect inflation to increase slightly, remaining close to 0.5%, in the coming months. According to him, inflation should be maintained at the lower end of the Swiss National Bank’s target, with a range of 0 to 2% although price changes have been observed to remain minor. The economist further pointed out the strong franc’s impact on local prices and the effects of Trump’s unexpected, higher-than-expected tariffs , which pose serious risks for the SNB. “We believe that if the currency remains strong, the central bank will cut rates in December,” he said . For now, SNB remains optimistic about the situation. Martin Schlegel, a Swiss economist and chairman of the governing board of the Swiss National Bank, cautioned that despite Switzerland’s stable future and moderate growth, there is a somewhat higher risk because of pharmaceutical tariffs. On the other hand, experts have highlighted that the harmful effects are increasing, pointing out that the country’s economy decreased by 0.2% in the third quarter. According to them, the decrease was observed after exports to the US drastically decreased in the first month when wide-ranging tariffs were imposed, excluding the effects of big sports events. Switzerland’s policymakers limited in reaction to inflation levels concerns Policymakers have highlighted that their main challenge is the limited ability to respond to such a serious situation. They further clarified that they have difficulty reintroducing negative interest rates compared to regular cuts. One option is to increase reliance on currency operations to depreciate the franc, which would help offset the costs of importing goods. In the meantime, this week’s data revealed that inflows to Switzerland after Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements caused the Swiss National Bank to make its first major foreign exchange purchases in over three years. The underlying inflation pressures are slightly stronger than the overall number suggests. A measure that excludes unstable factors, such as energy prices, remained at 0.7%. Elsewhere in the euro area surrounding Switzerland, consumer-price growth is still faster, reaching 2.2% last month. According to the European Union’s standard measure, Switzerland has a zero inflation rate. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Will the Rise Continue?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/grayscale-announces-long-territorial-altcoins-price-skyrocket-becomes-todays-highest-rising-altcoin-will-the-rise-continue/,"As October begins to unfold for Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins, the market is positive. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has seen a 3% increase, Ethereum (ETH) a 4.7% increase, XRP a 3% increase, and Dogecoin (DOGE) an 8% increase, while some altcoins have also seen gains. One of these altcoins was Zcash (ZEC), with a 56% increase in the last 24 hours. While it is stated that the Grayscale announcement is behind this rise, the rise is expected to continue. Cryptocurrency analysis platform Alphractal noted that the price skyrocketed after Grayscale's post about Zcash. Alphractal has analyzed that Zcash (ZEC), one of the earliest pioneers in the privacy-focused cryptocurrency sector, is showing strong upward momentum. Analyzing the rise of ZEC, Alphractal analysts concluded that the rise could continue, according to the data. “1. ZEC broke through key on-chain levels such as Realized Price, which is a bullish signal. 2. The number of addresses holding more than $10 million has increased. 3. Delta Growth Rate is in the positive range, indicating that ZEC's upward momentum is driven by fresh speculative capital. 4. The MVRV Z-Score has turned positive, signaling that ZEC's upward trend continues at full speed. As a result, analysts noted that the involvement of institutional players could provide significant liquidity to ZEC and enable its price to rise more stably and sustainably. Grayscale, one of the largest asset management companies, announced on its official X platform that the Grayscale Zcash Trust has been opened for private placement to eligible accredited investors. This development allows qualified investors to participate in the Zcash-focused trust. After Grayscale’s post about ZCash, the price skyrocketed. Taking advantage of this $ZEC rally, we explored a few metrics to support analysts: 1. ZEC has just broken key on-chain levels, such as the Realized Price, which is a bullish signal. 2.

Strategy, the world’s largest public holder of Bitcoin with a $75 billion trove, announced it no longer expects to face a multi-billion tax liability tied to unrealized crypto gains after new guidance from the IRS and Treasury. The 71-page update says companies don’t have to include unrealized Bitcoin gains or losses in the 15% Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) calculation. This saves Strategy from billions in potential payments and eases fears that long-term Bitcoin treasuries would be penalized for appreciation. Strategy Inc (MSTR) Price Update – Source: Yahoo Finance Shares of Strategy climbed 5% to $338 on Wednesday, extending a six-month advance of more than 10%. Analysts say the decision removes a “significant overhang” that could have weighed on corporate adoption. For Strategy, which has never sold a Bitcoin since it began buying in 2020, the relief comes as it sits on roughly $28 billion in unrealized profit. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Technical Outlook From a technical standpoint , Bitcoin broke out above the descending trendline that capped September’s rallies, closing above $118,600 and testing $119,477. A bullish engulfing candle on the 4 hour chart with strong volume did the trick. The 50-SMA ($112,455) is above the 100-SMA ($113,555) confirming the uptrend. The RSI at 79 is overbought, so we’re likely to see some consolidation or a pullback to $116,950-$117,500 before the next leg up. If support holds, the next targets are $122,335 and $124,525 with potential extensions to $128,000 in the coming weeks. For traders, the most balanced setup involves waiting for a dip toward the $117K zone before targeting a renewed push higher. #Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC breaks above $118.6K, testing $119.4K resistance. RSI shows overbought risk, but support at $116.9K could spark a rally toward $122.3K–$124.5K. pic.twitter.com/igCevjIIp9 — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 2, 2025 With macro tailwinds, institutional buying, and now regulatory clarity favoring holders, Bitcoin’s latest rally positions it not just for near-term gains but for a broader corporate adoption cycle. That combination could fuel the next wave of demand as firms reassess the role of BTC in treasury management.

USDT and USDC combined market share has fallen from 91.6% to ~83.6%. Emerging yield-bearing stablecoins like Ethena’s USDe have grown rapidly, changing competitive dynamics. Bank consortia and regulatory shifts (e.g., MiCA, GENIUS discussions) increase issuance options and distribution channels. Primary keyword: stablecoin duopoly — Learn why USDT and USDC market share is declining and what new issuers mean for stablecoin investors. Read more. Despite dominating stablecoin inflows, Tether’s USDt and Circle’s USDC have slowly lost market share, signaling the end of the “stablecoin duopoly.” Despite Tether’s USDt (USDT) and Circle’s USDC (USDC) steadily increasing nominal market capitalizations, their combined dominance of the stablecoin market has declined meaningfully since early 2024. Data tracked by industry aggregators such as DefiLlama and CoinGecko show a notable shift in market share allocation. What is the stablecoin duopoly and is it ending? The stablecoin duopoly describes USDT and USDC controlling the majority of circulating stablecoins. Their combined share peaked at 91.6% in March 2024 and has since declined to roughly 83.6%, driven by yield-bearing entrants and new bank-issued initiatives. How have USDT and USDC market shares changed since 2024? USDT and USDC reached a combined market capitalization share of 91.6% when the market was near $140 billion. At that peak, USDT was ~ $99 billion and USDC ~ $29 billion. Since Oct. 2, 2024, the pair has lost more than 5% of combined share, now roughly 83.6%. Market capitalization of USDT and USDC versus total stablecoin market cap. Sources: DefiLlama, CoinGecko Why are challengers gaining traction? New issuers are offering yield-bearing mechanics, attractive passive returns, and varied collateral frameworks. Nic Carter, partner at Castle Island Ventures, notes that intermediaries and startups are becoming more assertive, creating a “race to the bottom with yield” or a competitive yield frontier that undercuts legacy issuers. Ethena’s USDe is singled out as the largest recent success, expanding supply to an estimated $14.7 billion by offering yield derived from basis trading strategies. Other notable entrants include Sky’s USDS, PayPal’s PYUSD, World Liberty’s USD1, Ondo’s USDY, Paxos’ USDG, and Agora’s AUSD (all referenced as plain text sources). How will bank-issued stablecoins affect the market? Regulatory changes and bank collaboration are reshaping distribution. Carter argues that consortia of banks are the most plausible challengers because no single bank has the distribution to match Tether. Recent European efforts, including a joint venture involving ING and UniCredit under MiCA compliance, aim to issue a euro-denominated stablecoin in H2 2026. Five top yield-bearing stablecoins by market cap. Source: CoinGecko What regulatory and market risks should readers consider? Yield-bearing stablecoins face scrutiny in legislative discussions like the US GENIUS Act. Regulatory pressure can alter product structures and distribution. Investors should watch official regulatory texts, market-cap data from monitoring services such as DefiLlama and CoinGecko, and announcements from major payment firms and banks. Frequently Asked Questions How quickly is the stablecoin duopoly dissolving? The duopoly has declined from 91.6% in March 2024 to about 83.6% now, a drop of roughly 8 percentage points. The pace depends on issuance velocity of yield-bearing coins and bank consortia rollout timetables. Are yield-bearing stablecoins safe? Yield-bearing stablecoins carry additional counterparty and market risks versus traditional fiat-backed stablecoins. Regulatory safeguards and transparent reserve reporting improve trust, but returns often reflect higher structural complexity. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Stablecoin Duopoly Eroding as Yield-Bearing and Bank-Backed Coins Rise"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199a4bd-c02e-7733-a800-74b54be52490.webp""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""stablecoin duopoly — USDT and USDC market share is sliding as yield-bearing and bank-backed stablecoins rise; key data and expert insight."", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/stablecoin-duopoly"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is the stablecoin duopoly?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The stablecoin duopoly refers to USDT and USDC controlling the bulk of stablecoin market capitalization; their combined share has dropped from 91.6% in March 2024 to around 83.6%."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Why are yield-bearing stablecoins growing?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yield-bearing stablecoins attract capital by offering passive returns, often sourced from basis trades or DeFi strategies, which appeals to holders seeking yield in a low-interest environment."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to monitor stablecoin market share shifts"", ""description"": ""Practical steps to track changes in stablecoin dominance and evaluate new issuers."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check market-cap aggregators"", ""text"": ""Review market capitalization and supply figures from data aggregators such as DefiLlama and CoinGecko as plain-text references."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Compare yield structures"", ""text"": ""Analyze the mechanics of yield-bearing stablecoins to understand sources of return and associated risks."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor regulatory updates"", ""text"": ""Follow legislative developments and bank announcements for changes that enable or restrict new issuances."" } ]} Key Takeaways Declining dominance : USDT and USDC combined share fell from 91.6% to ~83.6% since early 2024.

Ethereum breakout: ETH bounce near $4,000 confirmed support, driving altcoin interest—read analysis, key metrics, and next levels to watch on en.coinotag.com. Ethereum confirmed a breakout with a bounce near $4,000, reinforcing support levels and signaling renewed momentum for altcoins across the market. Ethereum confirmed a breakout above resistance with a retest near $4,000, creating a technical structure now guiding altcoin market performance. Altcoin markets are tracking Ethereum’s bounce, with liquidity flowing into Layer 2 tokens, DeFi platforms, and major Ethereum-based ecosystem projects. Traders monitor ETH/BTC and $TOTAL2 charts as Ethereum strength sets the framework for altcoins, aligning broader participation across multiple assets. Altcoins are drawing renewed attention after Ethereum confirmed a technical breakout, reinforcing market structure and signaling broader participation in the crypto sector. What is the Ethereum breakout and why does it matter? Ethereum breakout refers to ETH moving decisively above the upper resistance of a descending broadening wedge and successfully retesting the $4,000 area as support. This breakout matters because Ethereum often sets liquidity and sentiment that flow into Layer 2 tokens, DeFi projects, and other Ethereum-based altcoins. How did technical structure confirm the breakout? Crypto analyst 𝕄𝕠𝕦𝕤𝕥𝕒𝕔ⓗ𝕖 observed a right-angled descending broadening wedge that broke above its resistance and advanced. Following the breakout, ETH returned to the $4,000–$4,300 range and completed a textbook retest, confirming the breakout order: breakout → retest → follow-through. #Altcoins Look at this beauty $ETH. Exactly the bounce we expected. Many people still don’t realise how exciting and great the next few weeks/months will be for altcoins. It’s going to be breathtaking. [image attached] — 𝕄𝕠𝕦𝕤𝕥𝕒𝕔ⓗ𝕖 (tweet content, October 1, 2025) Following the breakout, Ethereum returned to the $4,000–$4,300 range, retesting the old resistance, which acted as new support. This rebound confirmed the order of the breakout and established a base many analysts view as a foundation for subsequent market developments. How does Ethereum’s retest near $4,000 affect altcoins? Ethereum’s successful retest near $4,000 reduces downside risk for many mid-cap and Layer 2 tokens and increases the probability of capital rotation into those assets. Historically, a strengthening ETH/BTC ratio has aligned with periods where altcoins outperformed, and the $TOTAL2 metric typically shows inflows when Ethereum leads. Which altcoin sectors are most likely to benefit? Layer 2 solutions and DeFi platforms are primary beneficiaries given direct correlation to Ethereum activity. Major Ethereum-based ecosystem projects and mid-cap tokens with strong on-chain metrics also attract early liquidity. Traders are monitoring breakout structures across these assets for confirmation. When should traders expect broader altcoin participation? Broader participation often follows sustained ETH strength and rising ETH dominance. If ETH holds above the $4,000–$4,300 band and approaches $5,000, rotation into altcoins typically accelerates within weeks, contingent on macro liquidity and on-chain indicators. Frequently Asked Questions What price levels confirm a bullish reversal for Ethereum? A confirmed bullish reversal typically requires ETH to sustain above the $4,000 retest and extend momentum toward $4,500–$5,000, with volume confirmation and improving ETH/BTC ratio. How do traders use $TOTAL2 to time altcoin entries? Traders watch $TOTAL2 for shifts in non-Bitcoin market capitalization; rising $TOTAL2 alongside ETH strength signals capital moving into altcoins and supports staggered entries into promising projects. Key Takeaways Ethereum breakout validated : Retest near $4,000 confirmed support and improved the risk-reward for altcoins. Altcoin flow : Layer 2 and DeFi tokens are primary targets for incoming liquidity. Metrics to watch : ETH/BTC ratio and $TOTAL2 provide early signals for altcoin participation; monitor $5,000 as next ETH technical reference. Conclusion Ethereum’s breakout and successful retest near $4,000 establish a technical foundation that could guide altcoin markets in the near term. Watch ETH/BTC and $TOTAL2 for confirmation signals, and expect Layer 2 and DeFi projects to lead the next phase of participation.
