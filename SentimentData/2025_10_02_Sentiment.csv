The new tokens, USDi and suiUSDe, are expected to launch later this year, according to a press release . USDi will be backed 1:1 by BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund BUIDL issued with tokenization specialist Securitize. Meanwhile, suiUSDe will mirror Ethena’s $14 billion USDe offering, a synthetic dollar backed by a mix of digital assets and short derivatives. ""We believe this initiative will add another powerful mechanism to drive liquidity, utility, and long-term value across the Sui blockchain, while positioning SUIG as one of the first publicly traded gateways to the global stablecoin economy,"" Marius Barnett, chairman of SUIG, said in a statement. The move is the latest example of crypto ecosystems making steps to issue proprietary stablecoins partnering with service providers instead of solely relying on the existing offerings such as Circle's USDC (USDC) and Tether's USDT (USDT). For example, Hyperliquid (HYPE), a layer-1 network known for its popular on-chain perpetual swaps exchange, held an auction for the rights of issuing the native USDH stablecoin to curb its reliance on USDC, with Native Markets in partnership with Stripe winning the competition. MegaETH, an Ethereum scaling network designed for fast transactions, also announced to launch a native stablecoin, partnering with Ethena. In August, the Sui network processed $229 billion in stablecoin transfer volume, outpacing its previous records, according to a Sui Foundation blog post . That kind of throughput is part of what drew Ethena to the chain.

Memecoins bring users but enrich platforms and bots. Launchpad Pump.fun accounts for a large share of Solana token launches and fees. Median hold times fell from ~300s to ~100s, highlighting bot-driven trading. memecoins drive platform revenue, not trader profits — read how launchpads and bots capture value. Learn more from COINOTAG. What are memecoins doing to crypto infrastructure? Memecoins are drawing fresh users to blockchains, but the resulting trading volume primarily benefits infrastructure providers—launchpads, DEXs and trading bots—rather than individual traders. Galaxy Research shows these services capture substantial fees and market value while traders face short holding windows and frequent losses. How do launchpads and exchanges profit from memecoin trading? Galaxy Research documents that launchpads and decentralized exchanges monetize token creation and immediate secondary-market trading. For example, Solana’s Pump.fun has facilitated nearly 13 million of the platform’s 32 million tokens and now represents a combined fully diluted market value of about $4.8 billion. Platforms collect primary sale proceeds, listing fees and trading fees. Tools that automate sniping or provide front-running capabilities extract additional revenue from high-frequency activity. Total token sales on Solana. Source: Galaxy Research Why are median hold times collapsing and what does that mean? Median hold times for Solana memecoins dropped to roughly 100 seconds, down from 300 seconds a year earlier. This collapse signals dominance by bots and scalpers that enter and exit positions in seconds to capture micro-profits. Short holding periods reduce retail traders’ ability to capture upside and increase transaction churn, which raises platform fee revenue but concentrates trading gains with sophisticated infrastructure operators. Galaxy Research: “The platform has simply industrialized token creation on Solana.” How concentrated are memecoin revenues? Revenue is highly concentrated among a few service providers. Axiom, a trading platform, reportedly generated over $200 million in fees with fewer than ten employees, according to Galaxy Research. Other automation tools such as BONKbot and Trojan monetize snipe strategies by charging users to access automated token purchase flows. Daily revenue from memecoin infrastructure. Source: Galaxy Research When did Pump.fun scale and what were the headline metrics? Pump.fun emerged in early 2024 and quickly scaled token creation on Solana. On July 12 it launched its token PUMP, raising $500 million in under 12 minutes via an initial sale of 125 billion tokens. Between Aug. 11 and Aug. 17, Pump.fun reportedly generated $13.48 million in revenue, its strongest week since February. Over a recent 30-day window, DefiLlama metrics show Pump.fun generated about $120 million in fees. Cointelegraph reported Pump.fun reached over $1 billion in daily trading volume on Sept. 14, recording $1.02 billion after $942 million the previous day. Frequently Asked Questions Do memecoins create long-term value for retail traders? Evidence indicates most retail traders do not capture lasting profits. The market is short-term and high-frequency, with many users losing money while infrastructure captures fees and automation captures front-run opportunities. How can investors evaluate memecoin-related risks? Assess token utility, distribution, and liquidity. Monitor on-chain metrics and platform fee flows. Recognize that rapid token launches and ultra-short hold times increase execution risk and favor automated trading. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Do memecoins create long-term value for retail traders?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Most retail traders struggle to profit long-term; memecoin markets are dominated by short-term trading, bots and platform fee capture according to Galaxy Research."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How do launchpads and bots capture memecoin revenue?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Launchpads collect primary sale proceeds and fees; exchanges and bots extract trading and snipe fees, concentrating revenue among infrastructure providers."" } } ]} Key Takeaways Memecoins attract users : They bring new participants but often create a short-term gambling market.

The probe centers on whether capital gains were improperly declared tax-exempt after a move to Puerto Rico. Top claim: Pantera founder accused of non-cooperation with Senate tax inquiry Sen. Ron Wyden opened the investigation into use of Puerto Rico residency for tax breaks. Senate alleges potential avoidance of over $100 million in U.S. federal taxes on capital gains. Dan Morehead tax probe: Sen. Wyden says Pantera founder refused to cooperate; learn the investigation details and next steps. Read for facts and official dates. What is the Dan Morehead tax probe? Dan Morehead tax probe is a Senate Finance Committee inquiry led by Sen. Ron Wyden into whether Pantera Capital founder Dan Morehead improperly used Puerto Rico residency to avoid U.S. federal taxes on capital gains. The investigation examines residency timing, tax advice received, and potential noncooperation with Senate subpoenas. How did the Senate start the Pantera Capital tax investigation? The Senate Finance Committee opened a broader probe into how ultra-high net worth individuals use Puerto Rico tax incentives. In January, Sen. Ron Wyden directed inquiries specifically at Dan Morehead’s finances after reports that Puerto Rican residency was claimed ahead of large capital gains events. The committee is requesting documents and testimony to verify residency dates and tax filings. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Sen.

Ron Wyden accuse Dan Morehead of noncooperation? Sen. Ron Wyden wrote that Morehead’s attorneys initially signaled cooperation, but then “have all but disappeared,” raising concerns. Wyden cites questions about whether Morehead declared Puerto Rican residency to shield more than $100 million in capital gains from U.S. taxes. The senator views a lack of timely document production as obstruction to oversight. What are the specific tax issues under review? The committee is focused on three factual elements: residency timing relative to taxable events, the nature of tax advice received, and the interpretation of Puerto Rican tax law regarding new residents. Wyden notes Puerto Rico’s rules can require payment of U.S. taxes for certain transactions within a 10-year period after relocation. Frequently Asked Questions Did Dan Morehead respond to requests for comment? Dan Morehead did not provide a public response when contacted for comment, and the letter from Sen. Wyden states attorneys initially cooperated but then ceased responsive communication. How much tax avoidance does the Senate allege? The Senate letter references potential avoidance of “over $100 million” in federal taxes on capital gains tied to asset sales after the claimed residency shift to Puerto Rico. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is the main allegation against Dan Morehead?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The allegation is that Dan Morehead may have avoided over $100 million in U.S. federal taxes by claiming Puerto Rican residency before realizing large capital gains, and that he has not cooperated fully with the Senate inquiry."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Who is leading the investigation?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The investigation is led by Sen.

Short-term, the probe increases regulatory scrutiny of tax planning among crypto investors and funds. Pantera Capital’s recent moves into asset-backed treasuries and a $1.25 billion initiative to convert a public company position amplify interest in the firm’s tax and corporate structures. Regulators may seek tighter guidance on residency-based tax benefits. What official sources and dates are relevant? Primary points of record include Sen. Ron Wyden’s letter to Dan Morehead and the Senate Finance Committee’s January initiation of the broader Puerto Rico residency review. Relevant public reporting and firm announcements detail Pantera Capital’s corporate activity and investments. Key Takeaways Investigation focus : Whether residency in Puerto Rico was used to avoid U.S. taxes on capital gains. Alleged noncooperation : Sen. Wyden says Morehead’s legal team stopped responding after initial engagement. Industry impact : Increased scrutiny of crypto investor tax strategies and potential legislative or regulatory follow-up. Conclusion The Dan Morehead tax probe centers on alleged misuse of Puerto Rico tax incentives and possible noncooperation with the Senate Finance Committee. The inquiry highlights scrutiny of residency-based tax planning among ultra-high net worth crypto investors.

The U.S. President said that China’s refusal to purchase American crops has created new tension between the world’s two largest economies. The issue has become political ammunition at home, with Republicans from farm-heavy states demanding immediate action. Trump is set to face Xi after the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed that China had not booked any soybean shipments by September 18, the first time since 1999 that Beijing skipped new-season purchases. Last year alone, U.S. shipments made up one-fifth of China’s soybean imports, valued at more than $12 billion. Trump used his social media account on Wednesday to spell out his message. “I’ll be meeting with President Xi, of China, in four weeks, and Soybeans will be a major topic of discussion,” he wrote. “The Soybean Farmers of our Country are being hurt because China is, for ‘negotiating’ reasons only, not buying.” His post triggered a rally in soybean futures, which climbed by as much as 1.9% before trimming gains. The spike marked the sharpest intraday rise since August 21. Farmers and lawmakers had been waiting for such a signal after warning that the standoff was squeezing agricultural communities. Trump pushes Xi as Republicans sound alarms The president blamed Joe Biden for failing to enforce the Phase One trade deal that included a purchase agreement with Beijing during Trump’s first term. He said the previous administration’s inaction gave China space to avoid commitments. At the same time, he floated the idea of using tariff revenue to build a new aid package for farmers. “It’s all going to work out very well. I LOVE OUR PATRIOTS, AND EVERY FARMER IS EXACTLY THAT!” Trump wrote. “MAKE SOYBEANS, AND OTHER ROW CROPS, GREAT AGAIN!” China, the world’s biggest soybean buyer, has been holding back from U.S. imports, repeating the same playbook it used during the first trade war under Trump. The two countries are currently locked in a fragile trade détente that runs out in November. Both sides had lowered tariffs and relaxed export controls under that deal. Earlier this month, Trump and Xi spoke directly to prepare for the APEC meeting, where trade will dominate the face-to-face. Meanwhile, farm-state Republican senators met with U.S. Ambassador to China David Perdue this week and left pessimistic. They said there was no expectation that China would return to U.S. crops soon and warned that a bailout could only offer short-term relief. For lawmakers representing agricultural states, the absence of Chinese purchases has become a pressing problem, and the lack of solutions has left them demanding immediate answers from Trump. Trump faces risks as farmers struggle and courts weigh tariffs The plan to cover farm losses with tariff money could add legal troubles. Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China using emergency powers, but those duties have been struck down by lower courts. If the Supreme Court affirms those rulings, the government could be forced to return tens of billions of dollars in refunds. That outcome would undercut the financial base of any new farm aid package and raise questions about the administration’s next steps. For farmers across the Midwest and other rural regions, the standoff is personal. They backed Trump in 2024, but now their exports have dried up, leaving them exposed as federal safety-net programs shrink. Communities that had relied on global buyers like China are feeling the economic hit as new markets fail to replace lost demand. The second term of Trump has turned into a tough stretch for agriculture, with soybeans at the center of the struggle. The political cost is now becoming clear. With Republicans preparing for next year’s midterm elections, the party risks losing ground in districts that depend on farming.

Individual stocks: HIVE +41% month, CleanSpark +51% month, MARA +16% month (reported figures). Bitcoin miners pivot to high-powered computing to capture AI revenue; learn how market caps rose and what it means for miners. Read the latest analysis. What is driving Bitcoin miners to pivot to high-powered computing? Bitcoin miners are repurposing data center infrastructure to run high-powered computing (HPC) workloads because AI-related demand can offer stable, higher-margin revenue when crypto prices fall. This shift helps operators diversify income, improve utilization rates and justify capital expenditure on power and cooling. How did miner market caps respond to the pivot? Analysts at JP Morgan reported that the combined value of the 14 top publicly traded miners it tracks surpassed $50 billion for the first time.

This shift helped the combined market cap of 14 top public miners pass $50 billion, with notable individual gains at Hive Digital, Marathon Digital (MARA) and CleanSpark (CLSK).""} Why are miners able to run HPC workloads? Mining operations already invest in power, cooling and rack density, which overlap with requirements for HPC and AI inference. Strategic partnerships and equipment upgrades enable miners to host GPU-accelerated tasks or rent idle capacity to compute firms, creating new revenue when block rewards underperform operational costs. Frequently Asked Questions Which miners reported the largest recent stock gains? HIVE Digital rose nearly 9% over the past week and about 41% over the past month. NASDAQ-listed MARA climbed about 8% this week and ~16% over 30 days. CleanSpark surged roughly 51% month-over-month. These figures reflect recent market activity reported alongside the pivot narrative. Can bitcoin miners profit reliably from HPC work? Yes, when contracts and utilization rates are well-managed. Running HPC workloads requires different expertise, and profitability depends on pricing, power costs, and long-term customer commitments. Operators note margins improve when utilization is high and fixed costs are spread across multiple revenue streams. What notable corporate moves support this trend? Google publicly backstopped an arrangement allowing an AI compute provider and a miner to work together, illustrating big-tech interest in securing compute capacity. JP Morgan highlighted these partnerships in its analysis of miner valuations. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Which miners reported the largest recent stock gains?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""HIVE Digital, MARA, and CleanSpark showed notable month-over-month gains, with CleanSpark up ~51% and HIVE up ~41% in the period reported; these moves were tied to investor optimism about HPC pivots."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Can bitcoin miners profit reliably from HPC work?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Profitability is possible but requires new technical capabilities, strong utilization contracts, and competitive power costs.

Execution risk: Transition requires technical upgrades, new contracts and operational expertise; not all miners will succeed. Conclusion The pivot by bitcoin miners to high-powered computing reflects a strategic response to revenue volatility and rising demand for AI compute. With reported gains in market cap and notable stock moves at names like HIVE, MARA and CleanSpark, the sector is in transition. Expect further consolidation and partnership announcements as operators monetize idle capacity and seek durable, multi-revenue models.

The massive buildings filled with computers that power artificial intelligence. The eastern United States grid managed by PJM Interconnection LLC saw power supply expenses jump by $7.3 billion in its most recent auction, with facilities housing AI servers responsible for nearly half of those costs. About 67 million people living in 13 states depend on this grid for their electricity. According to a Wednesday report , these computer facilities made up 45% of total power supply expenses in the summer auction. Looking at the previous auction as well, the buildings contributed roughly two-thirds of record-high prices. Combined, both auctions show these facilities added $16.1 billion in expenses. The situation has become so contentious that Pennsylvania’s governor, Josh Shapiro, suggested his state might withdraw from the regional grid system. Everyday Americans feel the squeeze Kevin Stanley lives in Baltimore, Maryland, more than an hour away from northern Virginia’s concentration of server farms. The 57-year-old relies on disability income and has watched his energy costs surge about 80% compared to three years ago. “They’re going up and up,” Stanley explained to Bloomberg. “You wonder, ‘What is your breaking point?'” His experience reflects a growing problem as these energy-intensive facilities push electricity prices to new heights throughout much of the nation, forcing regular households to shoulder costs tied to digital infrastructure. The enormous buildings require vast amounts of electricity, adding to Americans’ financial strain from already climbing food and housing prices. This is creating both economic and political tension as utilities and community leaders debate how to split up the expenses. However, these same facilities are considered crucial for maintaining American competitiveness in global AI development. Technology corporations, now among the world’s most influential entities, have bet heavily on AI. The facilities, some large enough to cover much of Manhattan, contain endless rows of servers providing the computing capability and storage required to develop and operate AI systems. Energy demands will only grow larger as tech giants double down on AI infrastructure Nvidia Corp. recently announced plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI for new facilities. Microsoft Corp. signed a multiyear agreement valued near $20 billion with Amsterdam-based Nebius Group NV for cloud computing using a New Jersey location. OpenAI and Oracle Corp. created a partnership to construct 4.5 gigawatts of capacity, enough to supply power to millions of American residences. “The reliability crisis is here now; it’s not off in the distance somewhere,” stated Mark Christie, a past chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission who previously worked as a Virginia regulator. He noted that projected power demands, largely driven by requests to connect these facilities to the grid, are a major factor increasing expenses. The cost problem reaches beyond America. Japanese power auction prices reached record levels as officials anticipate an AI expansion, while Malaysia is raising rates for these facilities as new construction strains supply. A report from Aurora Energy Research in the UK projected that increased consumption from these buildings could drive power prices up 9% by 2040. Worldwide, these facilities are projected to use over 4% of electricity by 2035, per BloombergNEF. For perspective: if they were a nation, they would rank fourth globally in electricity consumption, trailing only China, the US and India. In America, power usage from these facilities is expected to double by 2035, reaching nearly 9% of total demand. Some experts predict this will be the largest jump in US energy consumption since air conditioning became widespread in the 1960s. This comes as the grid already faces challenges upgrading old infrastructure and adjusting to climate change. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

XRP Ledger’s XLS-33 MPToken V1 activation introduces a new token standard focused on simplifying asset tokenization and compliance. Multi-Purpose Tokens reduce the need for custom smart contracts, enabling secure and efficient asset tokenization with built-in features. The MPT standard supports a range of institutional DeFi use cases, including fractionalized assets and privacy-preserving transfers. The XRP Ledger has officially activated the XLS-33 MPToken V1 amendment after a 14-day activation window. This activation delivers Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs) , a ledger-native token model designed to make issuance and lifecycle management of tokenized assets simpler and more secure for institutions. The new standard embeds compliance, transfer controls, and metadata into the ledger itself. What is XLS-33 MPToken V1? XLS-33 MPToken V1 is an XRP Ledger protocol amendment that creates Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs) as a first-class ledger feature. MPTs allow issuers to attach compliance rules, metadata, and transfer controls to tokens without deploying custom smart contracts, improving security and operational efficiency. How do Multi-Purpose Tokens change asset tokenization? MPTs shift common token functions to the ledger layer, so financial institutions no longer need to rely on bespoke contract code for basic compliance. The activation followed a 14-day network signaling period and is intended to reduce audit complexity and operational risk. Built-in features include issuer-controlled transfer restrictions, standardized metadata, and optional privacy-preserving transfer modes. The new token standard, Multi Purpose Tokens, just got activated on the XRP Ledger . Let the tokenization of everything enter the next stage! pic.twitter.com/75YaXwjzql — Vet (@Vet_X0) October 1, 2025 MPTs are particularly suited to use cases such as fractionalized real-world assets, tokenized money market funds, closed-loop loyalty tokens, and vault share issuance for lending protocols. By standardizing key features at the ledger level, MPTs enable secondary market activity and introduce pathways for confidential transfers that preserve privacy while maintaining compliance controls. Why are MPTs important for institutional DeFi? MPTs provide the building blocks institutions require to adopt DeFi primitives with predictable governance and compliance. With transfer rules and metadata embedded into the ledger, issuers can create financial products — for example, tokenized funds or vault shares — with lower operational overhead and reduced counterparty risk. This ledger-native approach advances the XRP Ledger’s position as a platform for regulated tokenization and institutional finance. Frequently Asked Questions How quickly did XLS-33 activate on the network? The XLS-33 MPToken V1 amendment activated after a standard 14-day consensus activation period on the XRP Ledger, following node signaling and network readiness checks. Can MPTs replace custom smart contracts entirely? MPTs remove the need for custom smart contracts for common token controls and compliance, but specialized on-chain logic beyond ledger-level features may still require additional smart contract layers or off-ledger processes. Key Takeaways Native tokenization: MPTs embed compliance and control into the XRP Ledger, simplifying issuance workflows. Institutional use cases: Supports fractionalized assets, tokenized funds, vault shares, and privacy-preserving transfers. Operational benefits: Reduces audit and contract complexity, enabling faster, more secure token launches. Conclusion The XLS-33 MPToken V1 activation marks a meaningful step for the XRP Ledger toward standardized, ledger-native asset tokenization. By providing Multi-Purpose Tokens with built-in compliance and metadata, the ledger lowers technical barriers for institutions and accelerates practical DeFi adoption. Expect issuers to pilot fractionalized assets and regulated token products in the coming months as MPT tooling matures.",News|FLOW|XRP,EN,0,0,WALLET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BLOCKCHAIN|FLOW,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-01 22:25:39
52536621,https://cryptonews.com/?p=431033,1759357800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52536621.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy Now 1 October – XRP, Pepe, Pi Coin",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-1-october-xrp-pepe-pi-coin/,"Crypto markets advanced 3% overnight in what looks like a sustained recovery from recent price inertia, leaving many traders asking the pressing question: which tokens are the best to buy right now? Bitcoin remains about 7% below its all-time high (ATH) of $124,128, recorded mid-August. However, its dominance is waning as investor enthusiasm shifts toward high-performing altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which have hit fresh records within the past year. This renewed optimism stems largely from two landmark policy changes in Washington. President Trump recently signed the GENIUS Act, the first U.S. law focused solely on stablecoin regulation. Shortly afterward, the SEC unveiled “Project Crypto,” a major modernization push to bring securities regulations into alignment with digital assets. With sentiment recovering, traders are keeping close tabs on XRP, Pepe, and Pi Network as the best crypto dip-buying opportunities ahead of what could be the next bullish cycle. Ripple ($XRP): Dominating Global Crypto Payments and Best Poised to Lead 2025’s Altcoin Rally Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) hit a record high of $3.65 on July 18 this year, right as the GENIUS Act passed into law. It was the first sign of movement for holders after seven years trading below its 2018 all-time high (ATH) of $3.40, five of which were marred by a high-profile SEC lawsuit. Today it trades around $2.94, or 20% below the peak. XRP’s edge comes from its fast, low-cost cross-border payment network, making it a modern alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. Its credibility has grown with recognition from the UN Capital Development Fund and wider U.S. financial adoption. Ripple’s policy clout was underscored earlier this year when CEO Brad Garlinghouse joined a White House roundtable on crypto. The rollout of RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin, highlights its push into the rapidly growing stablecoin market. Momentum also accelerated after a pivotal 2023 court ruling confirmed XRP’s retail sales were not securities, an important victory in its long battle with the SEC. Over the past 12 months, XRP has soared 366%, easily outpacing Bitcoin’s still-strong 82% gains. After peaking in July, it found support near $3 before sliding during the September downturn. Currently, XRP’s RSI sits near 51 and is trending higher, suggesting more upside in the short term. Even though Fed rate cuts and the debut of the first spot XRP ETF at the end of last month didn’t spark a breakout, the presence of three bullish flag patterns on the charts, combined with upcoming ETF rulings expected in mid-October, could propel XRP up to $7 by the New Year. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Token Star Still Brimming With Growth Potential Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) quickly rose to become one of the top meme coins by market cap, taking inspiration from Matt Furie’s legendary frog meme. Its meteoric rise triggered a flood of imitators, though none matched its success. Now capitalizing a little over $4 billion of crypto’s $4.09 trillion market cap, Pepe has captured worldwide attention, even Elon Musk briefly adopted its logo as his X profile picture. Currently trading at around $0.000009621, PEPE is down 66% from its late-2024 high of $0.00002803, as broader macroeconomic headwinds dragged on crypto markets through most of the summer. Still, October has historically been a strong month for digital assets, and if the “Uptober” trend repeats, Pepe could be challenging new highs by November, with analysts pointing to possible 3.5× returns by 2026. At present, its RSI sits near 44 and climbing, signaling people are buying back in, so the price could well be significantly higher next week. Supporters believe that a friendlier macro environment and improving investor confidence could drive PEPE into uncharted price levels later this year. Pi Network ($PI): Can the Mobile Mining Pioneer Regain Strength Before Year’s End? Pi Network revolutionized mining by introducing a tap-to-earn model that democratizes crypto mining by eliminating the need for energy-intensive rigs or big stakes. With users able to mine tokens through simply opening the app daily and tapping, Pi dramatically lowered the barrier to entry, allowing newcomers to participate in crypto without technical hurdles. Since May, Pi’s RSI has risen from below 30 to around 34, a bullish sign suggesting traders are buying the recent dip. The team is currently rolling out major upgrades, transitioning the network from version 19 to version 23, a critical step toward the long-awaited mainnet launch. For long-term believers, this cooldown phase may present a strategic buying opportunity. A falling wedge pattern spotted earlier this year suggests a possible breakout by December. If market sentiment turns positive, Pi could push back above $1.50 before November ends, which would be a seven-month high. Thanks to its easy-to-use interface and proprietary Layer 1 blockchain, Pi is well-positioned to capture adoption in the next wave of crypto expansion. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): How a Bitcoin Layer 2 Became One of 2025’s Best Crypto Presales Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is emerging as a standout presale heading into 2025, blending Bitcoin’s security with Layer 2 scaling solutions while tapping into meme culture and decentralized governance. Its vision: unlock Bitcoin’s full potential by enabling faster payments, smart contracts, and community-driven decision-making. The presale has already attracted more than $19.5 million, with analysts projecting post-launch gains of 10× or more. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER delivers low-cost smart contracts, instant Bitcoin transfers through a Canonical Bridge, and full support for dApps, meme tokens, and payment systems. A recent Coinsult audit found no vulnerabilities, strengthening investor trust. HYPER tokens fuel the ecosystem via staking, governance rights, and transaction fees. Early investors are currently earning up to 6% APY in staking rewards, with voting rights to go live once governance is activated.

Bitcoin, the $2 trillion heavyweight of the crypto sector, is trading only 6% below its record high of $124,128. It rose 3% overnight, in line with a 3% spike in market cap across the $4.09 trillion industry. Historically, October, often nicknamed “Uptober”, has been one of Bitcoin’s best-performing months, increasing the likelihood of fresh all-time highs for many leading projects. At the same time, U.S. lawmakers are helping to accelerate momentum. In July, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first federal law to establish clear stablecoin regulations, requiring full reserve backing. Shortly thereafter, the SEC introduced “Project Crypto,” a policy overhaul designed to align securities laws with the realities of digital assets. With regulatory frameworks falling into place, analysts believe the next altcoin cycle could dwarf the 2021 rally. If Perplexity’s outlook proves correct, XRP, Cardano, and Dogecoin may spearhead the surge. XRP (Ripple): Perplexity AI Sees ~600%+ Surge to $20 According to Perplexity’s models, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could reach as high as $24 by late 2025, representing a 580% rise from its current level near $2.94. Source: Perplexity AI This year, XRP has already demonstrated considerable strength. On July 18, it touched $3.65, breaking past its 2018 high of $3.40, before retreating around 20% due to global macroeconomic and political headwinds. Ripple continues expanding its cross-border payments network worldwide, with growing institutional recognition. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund endorsed XRP as a cost-efficient remittance solution for developing economies. The token also secured a major regulatory win. In early 2025, the SEC officially dropped its lawsuit after a 2023 ruling determined that retail sales of XRP were not securities. Perplexity suggests that a decisive move above the July high could set a target of $5.50 by year-end at the very least, while a bullish breakout could see XRP push toward $7–$20. Over the last year, XRP has gained 366%, outshining Bitcoin’s 82% advance and performing six times better than Ethereum’s 63%. Technical indicators are also flashing bullish signs, with three bullish flags throughout the year hinting at a potential breakout in Q4. Although markets have so far been muted in response to Fed rate cuts and the first spot XRP ETF, upcoming ETF rulings and new crypto legislation could be powerful catalysts. Cardano ($ADA): Perplexity AI Predicts Threefold Growth in Three Months Cardano ($ADA) has been regaining visibility, largely due to its reputation as a credible Ethereum alternative, which means that, like its biggest rivals, Ethereum and Solana, it is constantly onboarding new developers and use cases. Founded by Ethereum co-creator Charles Hoskinson, Cardano stands out for its peer-reviewed development model and strong focus on sustainability, scalability, and scientific research. With a market value exceeding $30.6 billion, Cardano is establishing itself as a serious competitor to Ethereum and narrowing the gap with Solana in adoption. Perplexity projects ADA could climb to between $1.88 and $2.50 by the end of 2025. In the best-case scenario, that’s a threefold increase in three months from its current $0.8384. From a charting perspective, ADA has been consolidating in a descending wedge since late 2024, facing resistance around $1.10. A strong “Uptober” rally could push ADA substantially towards $2 in Q4, but a full-scale bull market would be required for it to notch the higher targets. The $2.50 forecast implies that Perplexity isn’t sold on the possibility of ADA surpassing its 2021 peak of $3.09, achievable only if adoption accelerates under a favorable U.S. regulatory regime. Dogecoin ($DOGE): AI Predicts Long-Awaited $1 Milestone Dogecoin ($DOGE) , originally created in 2013 as a joke, has grown into a top-10 digital asset with a $36.7 billion valuation in the $78 billion meme coin market. Its success is driven by a loyal community and increasing use as a payment token. Although often correlated with Bitcoin’s movements, Dogecoin’s high liquidity and strong retail backing have allowed it to survive multiple market downturns. Now priced at $0.2429, DOGE has more than doubled over the past year, outpacing Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Shiba Inu, and Pepe. The RSI is also in the neutral zone of 50 and climbing, suggesting meme fans are buying back in. In the last 24 hours, Doge has risen 5.4%, outperforming the top cryptos, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, which all rose by around 3%. Technical charts have repeatedly shown bullish falling wedge patterns between late 2024 and mid-2025, pointing to the potential for a significant breakout. Perplexity projects DOGE could finish the year between $0.25 and $0.42. Hitting the upper end would still mean it’s trading 43% short of its 2021 ATH of $0.7316. However, adoption is generally growing: Tesla continues to accept DOGE for merchandise, while payment platforms like PayPal and Revolut now support Dogecoin transfers. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A High-Risk Meme Coin Alternative Outside of its top picks, Perplexity notes rising interest in Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a speculative meme token branding itself as Dogecoin’s “amped-up cousin.” It’s designed for traders chasing high-volatility low-market cap plays, along with fun degen community building. Unlike Dogecoin, which has evolved into a more established large-cap asset, Maxi Doge is leaning into meme culture and hype cycles. Since launch, it has already raised over $2.6 million in a matter of weeks. Built on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, MAXI emphasizes community-driven growth, leveraging Telegram and Discord campaigns, trading competitions, and upcoming collaborations. Out of its 150.24 billion supply, 25% goes to a “Maxi Fund” for marketing and partnerships. Staking has gone live, offering yields up to 128% APY, though rates will decrease as participation rises. Currently, presale tokens are $0.00026, with gradual increases as the presale moves into future funding rounds. Investors can buy through the Maxi Doge website using wallets such as MetaMask or Best Wallet . Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

Wyden's probe into whether Morehead committed tax evasion began in January, and is focused on how the Pantera founder reported taxes on his share of proceeds after a large crypto sale by the firm. According to a press release , Wyden is specifically looking at whether Morehead ""misrepresent[ed] his residency status"" when Pantera generated over $1 billion in capital gains from crypto sales by claiming his profits from the sale came while he was in Puerto Rico. Residents of the U.S. territory do not pay income tax on capital gains. ""It is my understanding your share of these gains … was hundreds of millions of dollars,"" Wyden said in the letter , sent on Wednesday. ""It is also my understanding that you treated the entire [gain] as exempt from U.S. tax, even though the lion’s share of these gains accrued while you still resided in California. These are serious allegations of potential abuse of Puerto Rico tax incentives to avoid the payment of U.S. taxes that you must immediately address."" Wyden's letter alleged that Morehead's attorneys ""have all but disappeared"" despite initially engaging with his staff. He also said in the letter that he believes Morehead was advised by Jeffrey Rubinger, a Miami-based attorney who advised another client who ""recently pled guilty to a tax fraud scheme"" tied to the same Puerto Rico tax rules. A Pantera spokesperson referred CoinDesk to a previous statement from Morehead, when he told the New York Times in a statement earlier this year that, ""I believe I acted appropriately with respect to my taxes."" Wyden's probe does not carry the full weight of an investigation by the Senate Finance Committee at the moment, given Democrats are the minority party in the Senate and committee Chair Mike Crapo — the top Republican on the committee — does not appear to have joined in the inquiry at this time. Wyden's letter came the same day the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on crypto tax issues specifically. Witnesses at the hearing warned that the IRS may soon face a deluge of tax reporting.

Six spot XRP ETF issuers face their final decision deadline in October, as potential new touchpoints for TradFi markets to gain exposure to the altcoin . XRP ETF DECISIONS COMING THIS OCTOBER! There are 6 companies awaiting SEC decisions on $XRP ETFs starting from the 2nd week of October. pic.twitter.com/vXAEZwZHEY — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) September 30, 2025 The lineup spans from straightforward spot funds to leveraged and short products, with proposed assets under management ranging from millions to over $100 billion. While these figures don’t represent guaranteed inflows, they reflect the scale of demand that could be unlocked as TradFi on-ramps into XRP, particularly as the U.S macro narrative heats up. With inflation nearing the Fed’s 2% target, hopes for continued interest rate easing are growing, with the potential to stimulate new demand for risk assets like XRP. XRP Price Prediction: Could Fresh ETF Demand Push XRP over $10? These potential inflows could give XRP the fuel it needs to realise the breakout of a 10-month cup-and-handle pattern now nearing its apex. A triple bottom has developed along the handle’s lower boundary at $2.70, a strong reversal structure that positions the latest bounce as the start of a breakout move. XRP / USD 1-day chart, cup-and-handle nears apex. Source: TradingView. Momentum indicators reinforce this outlook. The RSI has reclaimed the neutral line, indicating that buyers are driving the current market move. The MACD histogram shows a similar potential trend shift, on the verge of a golden cross above the signal line. This setup on the daily suggests the recent bounce may spark a wider uptrend. The key threshold for a confirmed breakout sits around $3.60 . Once flipped to support, the cup-and-handle pattern can realise its full breakout momentum. While $100 bullion inflows would only account for a 56% rise, the pattern eyes a much larger 165% move to $7.50. And with U.S. interest rate cuts fuelling demand across U.S. investment markets with greater TradFi exposure, a continued bull run into 2026 could extend to $15 for a 430% gain . This New ICO Can Secure Steady Gains, Bull Market or Not For a large altcoin like XRP, big breakouts are rare. Holders have been waiting over 8 years for a new all-time high. Some coins like PEPENODE offer bigger potential gains in the short term. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) lets you build virtual mining rigs to earn meme coins – no hardware needed. It’s the first mine-to-earn project of its kind, turning presale participation into an interactive mining experience. Buyers can set up digital nodes, stack rigs, and start generating rewards even before the token officially launches.

The pair is pressing into a long-standing demand shelf between $0.00000850 and $0.00001183, a band that has repeatedly arrested declines since 2022 and underpinned the market’s extended sideways structure. The zone is highlighted as the market’s “make-or-break” area: hold here and the path opens to a multi-leg advance; lose it and the structure degrades into a deeper drawdown. Key Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Levels Structurally, the macro picture remains defined by lower highs from the all-time peak, which continues to signal longer-term seller control. That said, the persistence of bids inside the $0.00000850–$0.00001183 box speaks to ongoing accumulation. The 6-day candles have compressed into a progressively tighter range, a classic volatility contraction that typically precedes expansion. With range width narrowing and tests of the same support recurring, the next directional move is likely to be sharp. On the topside, the first pivot is $0.00001580. CryptoNuclear frames this level as the initial breakout trigger on a 6-day closing basis, with volume confirmation required to validate impulsive intent. A decisive close above would expose a stair-step series of upside references at $0.00001940, $0.00002400, and $0.00003338, each corresponding to prior supply within last year’s distribution. Related Reading: Why Shiba Inu Price Could Explode 100% With This Descending Pattern On The 2D Chart Beyond those intermediate shelves sits a larger supply cluster at $0.00007870–$0.00008836, marked on the chart as the “High” band; in the event of a macro reversal, that zone could act as a longer-horizon magnet where profit-taking would be expected. Failure to defend the accumulation base flips the script. A breakdown through $0.00000850, especially on expanding volume, would invalidate the range thesis and shift focus to $0.00000543, annotated as the “Low” on CryptoNuclear’s chart and the next meaningful liquidity pocket below. Acceptance beneath that threshold would increase the risk of capitulation dynamics and the formation of new cycle lows, given the lack of dense historical trading in between. Market positioning follows naturally from the map. Optimistic dip-buyers view the $0.00000850–$0.00001183 area as value and a favorable risk-to-reward location, provided the market can reclaim and hold above $0.00001580 to convert resistance into support and sustain a trend continuation sequence. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Exchange Reserves Fall Below $1 Billion Amid Withdrawal Spree, What This Means For Price Cautious participants see symmetrical risk: the same compression that fuels breakouts can fuel breakdowns, and a daily-to-weekly close beneath the floor would argue for defense first. Neutral traders remain patient, waiting for confirmation via a 6-day close beyond either $0.00001580 or $0.00000850 before committing size. In sum, SHIB is coiled at a historically significant base that is likely to determine the asset’s macro path into 2025–2026. Respecting support keeps the recovery track intact toward $0.00001940, $0.00002400, and $0.00003338, with a more ambitious runway into the $0.00007870–$0.00008836 supply envelope if momentum broadens. Losing the base hands control back to sellers with $0.00000543 as the first downside checkpoint. For investors and swing traders alike, the $0.00000850–$0.00001183 zone—and the reaction around $0.00001580 overhead—are the levels to watch. At press time, SHIB traded at $0.00001231.

According to Ramos, upcoming U.S. events may create short-term uncertainty, but he believes the bigger picture still supports a recovery for XRP. He adds that patient investors who hold or accumulate could benefit the most in the long run. Ramos Says October Could Be A Turning Point For XRP Ramos points out that big investors and high-profile market players are already preparing for favorable conditions, such as the potential approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), while many retail investors remain cautious. He explains that while the price is in a narrow band for weeks, such periods of stability often create the groundwork for a significant shift. He compares the current situation to pressure building quietly, waiting for the right spark to release, and investors should not mistake calmness for weakness. Ramos also notes that XRP has been in a prolonged period of sideways trading. The price briefly moved above $3.60 but has remained mostly within a narrow range for over two months. He admits the token has underperformed since its all-time high of $3.65 in July, but he sees this calm period as a sign that a bigger move may be close . To him, buying XRP under $3 is a long-term investment that would be foolish to overlook. Short-term drops could happen, but Ramos argues the overall setup points upward . For this reason, he keeps a clear view that XRP holders who stay patient could benefit once the market breaks out of this extended calm. Fed Policy And Regulation Add To Bullish Outlook Ramos also links XRP’s next move to events in the United States. The Fed already cut interest rates, and Ramos says people are waiting for more signals from Chair Jerome Powell and other officials. He reminds XRP investors that these updates can move the market, even if they sometimes provide little new direction. Ramos also warns about possible disruption from U.S. government budget talks. According to him, the risk of a shutdown is something to “brace yourself a little bit” for, but he adds that leaders should resolve the issue. Speeches from Federal Reserve officials, along with new data on jobs, housing, and consumer confidence, which he says could shape investor sentiment in the coming weeks. For the longer horizon, Ramos explains that regulatory clarity and the arrival of Central Bank Digital Currencies remain critical milestones, although they may not arrive until 2026. In the meantime, institutional attention on exchange-traded funds is becoming a more immediate driver. By combining these short-term events with the bigger regulatory picture, Ramos believes investors have good reason to expect brighter days for XRP , with October marking the beginning of that shift.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BUSINESS|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 23:00:43

The automakers said the discounts are meant to keep EV sales from plunging after a record third quarter. They are also trying to clear existing inventories of electric cars that were ordered before the credit ran out. Ford and GM are extending the full $7,500 discount on leased EVs that are already on dealer lots or in transit to showrooms. Hyundai is applying the rebate more broadly. The company is offering $7,500 cash on both purchases and leases of the 2025 Ioniq 5, and it is also cutting the sticker price of the 2026 Ioniq 5 by as much as $9,800, depending on the trim level. All of this is being paid for directly by Hyundai rather than the federal government. Trump policy changes slow EV market and raise costs The companies warned that EV sales will slow in the coming months as President Donald Trump’s administration rolls out policies aimed at encouraging gasoline and hybrid models instead of battery-only vehicles. Automakers are adjusting production plans and preparing to offer more non-electric cars as demand for full battery-electric vehicles cools. Many American buyers are still staying away from EVs because of high prices and unreliable charging networks. “I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the US go down to 5% from about 10% now,” Jim Farley, the chief executive officer of Ford, said at a conference in Detroit this week. Farley also said the EV market will be “way smaller than we thought.” Automakers are already dealing with higher costs as Trump’s new trade deals impose tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts. Based on research from Cox Automotive, those tariffs could add $5,500 to the price of an imported vehicle and $1,000 even to U.S.-built cars that use foreign components. A September forecast from EY, a consulting arm of Ernst & Young Global, showed the U.S. EV market only reaching 11% of new car sales by 2029, up from 8.1% last year. Europe and China are far ahead. EY expects Europe’s EV share to pass 50% by 2032 and China’s to pass 50% by 2033. This gap is shaping how different carmakers approach their product plans. Hyundai funds rebates as GM locks in federal credits pre-deadline Hyundai is also retooling its $5.5 billion plant in Savannah, Georgia to build both hybrid and electric models for the U.S. market. “Because of the surge we saw in September, there’s going to be a reset in October, maybe November. But the EV market will settle,” said Randy Parker, Hyundai’s North America chief executive. Parker added, “There was an EV market before the IRA and there’s gonna be an EV market after the IRA,” referring to President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which created the now-expired tax credit. Hyundai said it is using its own funds to finance the $7,500 cash rebate on the 2025 Ioniq 5 and the discounts on the 2026 models. Parker said this shows Hyundai’s ability to operate “with a lot of uncertainty.” GM and Ford are taking a different path. GM Financial placed down payments on about 30,000 EVs before October 1 to secure the tax credit ahead of time. This allows GM to lease the vehicles with the $7,500 credit already included in the price. Once a lease is written, the Internal Revenue Service reimburses GM Financial. Ford Credit is running a similar plan, saying in a statement it will provide “competitive lease payments on retail leases through Ford Credit until Dec. 31.” Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",Tech|ford|General Motors|Hyundai,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING|ASIA,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-01 23:17:05

Hill’s nomination has been received in the Senate and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, according to a congressional website. If approved, the government’s role will be in effect for a five-year term. The nomination of Hill, who has been advocating for crypto-friendly banking policies, comes as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unveiled its rulemaking agenda for the upcoming month. These regulations could lead to broad proposals to revamp cryptocurrency regulations and reduce rules that Wall Street has decried as overly burdensome. The regulator formally outlined several of its initiatives to overhaul cryptocurrency policies, which SEC Chair Paul Atkins had previewed in July. Those include proposing rules regarding the offer and sale of digital assets, which the SEC said could include certain exemptions and safe harbors, as well as clarifying how its broker-dealer rules apply to cryptocurrency. Hill pushes FDIC toward pro-crypto rules as SEC eyes digital asset reforms According to congressional records, Trump’s nomination of Travis as FDIC chair was sent to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday. Initially, he served as a senior adviser to then-FDIC Chairman Jelena McWilliams during Trump’s first term. Before taking up his role at the FDIC, Hill stated that the department should offer additional guidance on digital assets and tokenization. He also pushed back on allegations of US authorities debanking companies due to their ties to crypto. In March, he wrote a letter aimed at financial institutions, clarifying that banks could engage with digital assets as a ”permissible activity.” “I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto- and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards,” Hill said. Meanwhile, the SEC has indicated that it is considering amending its rules to permit the trading of cryptocurrencies on national securities exchanges and alternative trading systems. If enacted, those policies would represent a major win for the digital asset industry, which has long pushed for tailored rules that would enable crypto to become more enmeshed with traditional finance. “This regulatory agenda reflects that it is a new day at the Securities and Exchange Commission,” Atkins said in a statement. “The items on the agenda represent the commission’s renewed focus on supporting innovation, capital formation, market efficiency, and investor protection.” Trump moves to reboot US crypto policy with key regulatory nominations Hill succeeds Martin Gruenberg, the previous Senate-confirmed FDIC chair, who resigned in January as part of the outgoing Biden administration. While Trump has announced several nominations that could shape US crypto policy, including Hill, key positions at major financial regulators remain vacant. This includes a potential replacement for Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chair Brian Quintenz and a Democratic commissioner’s seat at the SEC, which has been vacant since January. On the campaign trail last year, President Donald Trump courted the crypto community by pledging to be a “crypto president” and promote the adoption of digital assets. This stance contrasts sharply with the approach of former Democratic President Joe Biden’s regulators, who cracked down on the industry to curb fraud and money laundering. Under the Biden administration, the SEC filed lawsuits against exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance, along with dozens of others, alleging violations of US laws—cases that the Trump administration’s SEC has since dropped. The SEC also plans to propose a “rationalization” of disclosure requirements, a core part of the agency’s work aimed at increasing transparency and reducing risk for investors. Additionally, the agency has flagged plans to ease compliance burdens for public companies, particularly regarding shareholder proposals.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/crypto-veteran-says-its-time-to-sell-xrp-heres-why/,"A senior figure in the XRP community has urged investors to consider selling after Ripple’s long-time Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, announced he will step back from day-to-day responsibilities. According to Schwartz, a core architect of the XRP Ledger, he’ll transition to a scaled-back operational role at the end of the year and continue serving on Ripple’s board as an advisor. Schwartz’s Departure and Plans In his statement, Schwartz confirmed he intends to relinquish daily CTO duties but will continue to support XRP-related work in a less active capacity. He said he plans to remain on Ripple’s board as CTO Emeritus and will pursue independent development projects tied to the ledger. Schwartz described a desire to devote more time to hands-on engineering, experimentation, and personal priorities after more than a decade with the company. Messages of gratitude and respect for Schwartz’s technical contributions appeared across social channels immediately after the announcement. Many community members praised his role in building the ledger’s foundation and wished him success in his new endeavors. At the same time, the news has introduced uncertainty for some stakeholders who associate long-term stability with existing leadership. ALERT Time to sell $XRP 1) CTO stepping down to “research other use cases for XRP” (besides what Ripple is focused on)” 2) We’re at the stage where they start to openly admit failure 3) This comes at a critical time where SWIFT announced partnership with CONSENSUS https://t.co/ZnFhpHKoE6 — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) September 30, 2025 Exit Call from a Prominent Investor Reacting to the announcement, high-profile investor and early XRP backer Crypto Bitlord publicly recommended reducing XRP holdings. He argued that Schwartz’s change in responsibilities arrived during a period of heightened competition and pointed to recent industry moves by major incumbents as evidence that Ripple’s position faces fresh challenges. Bitlord criticized Ripple’s revenue profile, noting the company’s historical reliance in part on token sales rather than recurring cash flows from diversified product lines. He suggested that this business model raises vulnerability as institutional actors expand their own solutions. In a blunt assessment, the investor framed Schwartz’s new board role as consistent with corporate preparations for a potential public listing, rather than a guaranteed benefit for XRP token holders. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Shifts and Competition Observers have tied this leadership transition to wider shifts in the payments infrastructure landscape. The timing follows announcements from established financial networks that are accelerating blockchain integration and exploring proprietary ledger solutions in partnership with enterprise technology firms. Some analysts contend these developments reduce the likelihood that institutions will adopt an external public ledger as their primary settlement layer. Critics argue that the narrative claiming XRP will replace existing players overlooks the fact that major banks and payment networks typically want to maintain control over their own systems. That preference has informed recent industry projects that prioritize interoperability between legacy rails and tokenized assets while preserving institutional control. Community Sentiment Reactions within the XRP ecosystem remain mixed. While many supporters expressed appreciation for Schwartz’s continued involvement and welcomed his plans to return to technical work, other participants interpreted the move as a potential inflection point that warrants a reassessment of holdings and strategy. Schwartz emphasized that his decision is personal and that he intends to stay engaged with the ledger’s technical progress. He also expressed interest in exploring independent projects that could expand the XRPL’s applications beyond Ripple’s commercial activities. David Schwartz’s announcement marks a notable leadership change for a project closely associated with his technical leadership. While the transition has prompted some investors to recommend exiting positions, others view the shift as an opportunity for renewed technical innovation led by Schwartz himself. The long-term implications for XRP will depend on how Ripple, institutional partners, and independent developers respond to changing market dynamics and the CTO’s new focus on engineering and experimentation.

Regarding its Vision Pro headset, the tech giant was working on a lighter, more affordable version of its headset, called the N100. This version was set to be introduced in 2027. However, after several considerations, reports from sources with knowledge of the situation revealed that Apple instructed its staff to pause this project and focus on ways to accelerate the development of smart glasses. Tech firms explore the development of AI-related devices amid the AI boom era The adoption of AI technology continues to expand within tech companies. This has triggered a growing trend among these firms to develop devices focused on this technology. An example of the gadgets developed is smart glasses, which have sparked a fierce competition among tech rivals. Interestingly, like smart glasses, future designs could become just as significant as mobile phones, and Apple aims to be prepared for that. Concerning its project on smart glasses, the tech giant is targeting to create at least two types of these glasses. To begin with, the first version is known as N50. The model will link up with an iPhone, but it will not have its own screen. The company plans to showcase this model by next year, before its launch, which is set for 2027, according to sources familiar with the situation who wished to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the situation. The other version, which has a display, might compete with the recently released Meta Ray-Ban Display. To demonstrate the stiff competition in the tech ecosystem, insiders with knowledge of the matter revealed that this version was initially intended to be launched in 2028. Still, Apple aims to launch it earlier by accelerating its development. In the meantime, it is worth noting that even with this shift in priorities, the tech giant still lags behind Meta. To illustrate, Meta introduced its first smart glasses called Ray-Ban Stories in 2021, followed by a surprise success known as the Ray-Ban Meta in 2023. Meta solidifies its position as the leader in the tech space with the launch of smart glasses In September, Meta made several updates to its regular glasses. This included the installation of improved cameras, long-lasting batteries, and new designs specifically designed for athletes. For Meta, smart glasses have enabled it to expand its presence in the devices market. Notably, the tech company has had mixed results in hardware technology. On the other hand, Apple’s coming glasses will rely on voice commands and artificial intelligence, two areas where it has not always excelled. Earlier, the company lagged in releasing its Apple Intelligence platform and was forced to delay updates of Siri, its voice assistant. Despite facing significant challenges, Apple continues to make efforts to improve the situation. The company is pinning its hopes on a redesign of Siri, due as early as March, to drive its new line of devices like glasses, speakers, displays, and cameras. Other technology titans have their own ideas about the wave of devices to come. Amazon and Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., are vying to enter consumers’ homes with other AI-powered hardware. For instance, ChatGPT’s maker, OpenAI, enlisted former Apple design expert Jony Ive to help create sleek new gadgets.

Co-founder Dominic Ryder described his project’s new Ethereum-based standard, ERC-7621, as the “Basket Token Standard” (BTS). It allows real estate, commodities, and multiple ERC-20 tokens to be packaged into investment baskets, much like index funds. Ryder envisions Alvara becoming the “Fidelity of tokenized assets,” opening the door for venture capital firms to create products like distressed “value baskets” or elite “all-star baskets.” Most people just trade assets. With Alvara, the portfolio itself can become the product. Mint a basket → earn fees → build a record. And if you want out? Sell the entire strategy.

Broader adoption of tokenized funds indirectly strengthens Bitcoin’s position as the market’s most trusted digital asset, encouraging institutional involvement and expanding blockchain’s reach. Metaplanet Climbs to Fourth-Largest BTC Holder Institutional appetite for Bitcoin is also accelerating. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet recently added 5,268 BTC worth roughly $600 million, bringing its total holdings to 30,823 BTC. At today’s price of $118,353, the stash is valued at $3.6 billion, giving the firm an unrealized profit of about 7.5% based on its average cost near $108,000.

They are now the 4th largest publicly traded Bitcoin treasury company pic.twitter.com/rsuJcIn9dd — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 1, 2025 Metaplanet’s aggressive strategy, launched in April 2024, has quickly made it the fourth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Its growing presence adds further pressure to Bitcoin’s limited supply, reinforcing the narrative of BTC as a treasury asset and supporting long-term price appreciation. U.S. Lawmakers Revisit Crypto Taxation Rules In Washington, lawmakers are shifting tone on digital asset taxes. The U.S. Senate Finance Committee will hold a hearing on crypto taxation following fresh IRS guidance easing the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT). The rule change allows companies to exclude unrealized crypto gains and losses from CAMT calculations, offering relief to major holders like Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which owns more than 640,000 BTC. Policy experts from Coinbase and Coin Center are expected to testify. The move could ease selling pressure on corporate treasuries and foster more stable long-term confidence in Bitcoin. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Breakout Targets $124K Technically, Bitcoin has staged a decisive breakout, climbing above $118,000 and breaking through a descending trendline that capped rallies since mid-September. A bullish engulfing candle on the 4-hour chart, combined with heavy trading volume, underscores renewed buyer conviction. Price has reclaimed both the 50-day SMA at $112,037 and the 100-day SMA at $113,395, now key support levels. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The RSI sits above 80, suggesting strong demand but also short-term overbought conditions. A retest of the $116,950 breakout zone may occur before the next leg higher. If momentum holds, Bitcoin could test $120,200, then $122,335, and ultimately $124,525 — resistance that capped rallies earlier this year. Traders eyeing entries may look for pullbacks toward $117,000–$117,500, with upside potential extending toward $128,000 in the weeks ahead. This breakout not only highlights renewed technical strength but also dovetails with growing institutional demand and favorable regulatory shifts, setting the stage for a potentially stronger Bitcoin rally into year-end. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining BTC’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $19.4 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.013005—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses. You can buy HYPER tokens on the official Bitcoin Hyper website using crypto or a bank card.

52539939,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/xrp-consolidates-after-24h-red-as-solana-leads-altcoin-correction-analysts-still-eye-bull-season/,1759363140,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52539939.jpeg,XRP Consolidates After 24h Red As Solana Leads Altcoin Correction – Analysts Still Eye Bull Season,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/xrp-consolidates-after-24h-red-as-solana-leads-altcoin-correction-analysts-still-eye-bull-season/,"After a red 24-hour period, XRP has settled into a consolidation zone, stabilizing near $2.84 . While the pullback erased short-term gains, analysts argue it is part of a broader reset rather than a reversal. Meanwhile, Solana has led the correction among altcoins, shedding momentum after weeks of steady growth. Together, the two assets illustrate a familiar cycle: majors absorb selling pressure before setting up the next leg upward. Despite the dip, many traders remain convinced that the market is still shaping up for a bullish season, with consolidation seen as healthy preparation. For retail investors, however, corrections feel very different. Patience is difficult, and dips often push traders to rotate into fresh narratives. In Telegram groups and across X, discussions are already shifting from short-term red candles to longer-term opportunities. While XRP and Solana remain anchors in many portfolios, the speculative buzz is building elsewhere. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now appearing as one of the most mentioned tokens in retail conversations, a reminder that even during corrections, retail is hungry for asymmetric upside. XRP Stays Steady Despite Pressure XRP’s consolidation is a testament to its staying power. The token has survived through historical battles with regulators, prolonged legal cases, and dramatic sell-offs, only to endure among leading assets. The analysts note that its cross-border settlement use case provides an institutional basis to the token, even while the price action is disappointing. The consolidation now appears to be evidence of the strongest of hands riding out the storm, anticipating clearer directions. Whale tracking shows that there is steady activity, with big investors still buying when prices drop. This confidence shows that while regular traders often get scared, whales see consolidation as a chance to buy. Solana Leads The Correction Solana’s steeper pullback reinforces its position as a high-beta cryptocurrency. Profit-taking and liquidations have restored volatility after several weeks of strength. Investors who took entry during recent uplegs were caught out by the decline, but analysts don’t find this surprising. Solana has always paired dramatic growth with matching correction. Even though there was a decline, developer activity and ecosystem expansion continue to be healthy. Solana continues to fund NFT projects, DeFi initiatives, and meme coins to make sure that it’s still important within tech and culture. Long-term holders will see this correction as another buying chance and not a trend reversal. Experts Still Look to Bull Season Even with red candles, however, experts remain optimistic. Consolidative phases regularly precede higher prices, and markets reset their leverage to make better foundations. The bigger picture — increased institution involvement, ETF advances, and further uses of blockchain — all appears very bright. Analysts warn that corrections are a normal part of the process. They remove weaker investors and give large investors and institutions chances to buy more. This pattern has happened in every cycle, and current feelings suggest it will probably happen again. XRP’s consolidation and Solana’s correction haven’t shaken analysts’ belief in an upcoming bull season. Many now point to presales as the vehicles that can turn small positions into generational wealth opportunities . MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly described as one of those rare setups, blending unique branding with scarcity mechanics. For long-term investors, it represents the high-risk slice of a portfolio that could deliver outsized impact if momentum compounds. Comparisons are being drawn to early DOGE and SHIB allocations, where small risks transformed into cycle-defining wins. While XRP and SOL remain central to the bull thesis, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being discussed as the speculative piece that could reshape individual portfolios in the years ahead. Retail Psychology During Corrections The popularity of MAGACOIN FINANCE during altcoin pullbacks highlights retail psychology. Corrections test patience, and many smaller investors prefer to rotate into presales or meme-driven projects where growth feels faster. This isn’t necessarily irrational — it reflects different goals. Institutions prioritize stability, while retail seeks transformative outcomes. By offering both legitimacy through audits and excitement through scarcity-driven design, MAGACOIN FINANCE has positioned itself perfectly for retail investors during consolidation phases. It gives traders a sense of action when majors are standing still. How to Plan Before The Next Bull Leg The ongoing correction may frustrate short-term traders, but smart portfolios are built during these moments. Balancing Ethereum, XRP, and Solana with speculative exposure to projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE ensures resilience and optionality. When the next bull leg begins, portfolios structured this way capture both the institutional flow into majors and the retail surge into speculative names. Whales already appear to be adopting this strategy, quietly accumulating majors while also participating in presales. Retail investors who mirror this balance may be better positioned than those who focus exclusively on one side. Conclusion XRP’s consolidation after a 24-hour red period and Solana’s leading role in the correction show that markets are in reset mode. Analysts remain confident that these moves are precursors to a broader bull season rather than signals of decline. But for retail investors, the real excitement is often found outside the majors. MAGACOIN FINANCE , with its audits, scarcity-driven design, and viral community, has become one of the top names on retail watchlists. As XRP and Solana take time to recover, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides the speculative spark investors crave. The next bull season may be shaped not only by the performance of majors but also by how effectively retail captures momentum in projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE.

The token, once a major driver of retail enthusiasm, is now down more than 86% from its peak of $0.00008845. This year alone, SHIB has dropped nearly 44%, currently trading around $0.00001226 . While broader market assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum have managed steady gains, SHIB has remained stagnant near the $0.00001 level, fueling claims that the project has lost direction. Despite these criticisms, several factors could help the project recover and restore investor confidence. Addressing long-standing concerns while completing key ecosystem goals may be essential to putting SHIB back on track. These include the following; Improved Transparency and Leadership Structure One of the most frequent criticisms of Shiba Inu is the anonymity of its leadership . Although pseudonymous figures such as Shytoshi Kusama played a role in SHIB’s early growth, maintaining anonymous leadership at this stage creates barriers to accountability. In contrast, leading blockchain projects like Cardano, Ripple, and Dogecoin are managed by publicly identifiable teams. Moving toward a more transparent leadership structure could strengthen credibility and reassure investors. Strengthen Focus on the SHIB Ecosystem Concerns have also arisen regarding the team’s attention being divided between SHIB and other unrelated projects. Shytoshi Kusama’s promotion of the SHY token has drawn criticism for distracting investors from core SHIB ecosystem assets, including BONE, LEASH, and TREAT. Refocusing resources and messaging toward SHIB’s long-term utility would reinforce its relevance and could help realign the community’s attention. Improved Community Engagement The Shiba Inu community, known as the Shib Army , was once one of the most active forces in crypto. Their efforts contributed to SHIB’s listings on major platforms and its historic 2021 rally. However, enthusiasm has cooled in recent years. A renewed focus on direct engagement, clearer communication, and reward-driven participation could help reignite the community’s involvement and strengthen grassroots momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Addressing Oversupply Through Token Burns SHIB’s circulating supply of nearly 589 trillion tokens continues to limit price appreciation. While more than 41% of the total supply has already been burned, helped by community initiatives and Vitalik Buterin’s high-profile burn , progress remains slow. A structured, consistent, and large-scale token reduction plan could introduce meaningful scarcity and create better conditions for price recovery. Rebuild Security and Trust After Shibarium Incident The Shibarium Bridge hack raised significant concerns about the ecosystem’s security. Although steps have been taken, such as adopting multi-party custody solutions, cooperating with authorities, and offering bounties to attackers, the project must continue demonstrating commitment to robust security practices. Successfully restoring full functionality to the bridge would be a milestone in rebuilding trust among users and investors. Delivering on Pending Projects Shiba Inu has also faced criticism for delays in delivering major ecosystem products. Announcements around projects such as Shib: The Metaverse and the NFT marketplace have not translated into meaningful progress. Prioritizing the completion of these initiatives, rather than introducing new ones, would provide tangible value and demonstrate that the team can meet its commitments. Shiba Inu’s prolonged underperformance has prompted skepticism about its future, but dismissing it entirely may be premature. Greater transparency, stronger community engagement, meaningful supply reduction, improved security, and timely delivery of promised projects could help restore SHIB’s relevance in the cryptocurrency market. Without these changes, however, the project risks continuing its slide into obscurity. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

A new collaboration between Tobu Top Tours Co., Ltd. and SBI Ripple Asia Co., Ltd. aims to reshape digital transactions by combining blockchain technology with real-world commerce . The initiative could create new waves of opportunities for businesses, travelers, and communities. Ripple And XRP Strengthen Payments In Japan A recent press release by Tobu Top Tours reports that the Japanese travel MICE agency has partnered with SBI Ripple Asia to launch a new payment platform built on the XRP Ledger. The agreement, signed on September 30, marks a significant step toward integrating blockchain into mainstream industries , with tourism and commerce set to benefit the most. The initiative is designed to issue unique tokens by SBI Ripple Asia for partner companies and organizations. Tobu Top Tours will integrate these tokens into its ecosystem, linking them with Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that the company manages and plans to launch in 2026. The goal of the payments platform is to help businesses and organizations strengthen their fan economies, while also providing users with new ways to pay for services such as lodging, dining, and shopping. As part of the collaboration, Toby Top Tours will take the lead in securing partnerships , building a wide user and merchant network, and developing marketing strategies based on NFTs. Meanwhile, SBI Ripple Asia will handle the technical infrastructure by leveraging the XRP Ledger to issue secure, reliable tokens. With this blockchain foundation, customers can easily make payments using their tokens seamlessly in everyday situations. XRP Utility Expand Into Tourism And Fan Economies Beyond developing innovative payment systems, the Tobu Top Tours and SBI Ripple Asia alliance is aiming to have a broader societal and cultural impact. Several envisioned use cases for the new platform aim to address social challenges while simultaneously opening up new markets. In the tourism industry, companies plan to issue unique tokens restricted to specific regions or tourist hubs. This localized currency will enable travelers to enjoy seamless, cashless transactions across destinations, thereby stimulating spending and circulating money within the local economies. By pairing token usage with NFTs, such as digital souvenirs or future discount vouchers, the system is expected to foster lasting engagement even after the traveler has left. Another major application lies in disaster relief and reconstruction efforts . Instead of distributing traditional aid, funds could be provided as unique tokens that are redeemable only in the affected region. This ensures that financial assistance is spent locally, directly supporting shops, hotels, and restaurants. According to the press release, the upcoming payments platform could also have transformative potential for the entertainment industry , particularly in areas of culture, music, and sports . Professional teams, musicians, and cultural organizations can create tokens for exclusive use within their respective communities, thereby enhancing fan engagement.",XRP|MICE|nfts|Non Fungible Tokens|ripple|SBI Ripple Asia|Tobu Top Tours|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|XRP|WALLET|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-02 00:00:50
52539590,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=830338,1759363252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52539590.jpeg,"Bitcoin Displays Disturbing CME Gap, Here’s What Happens If The Gap Closes",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-disturbing-cme-gap/,"Bitcoin is now back trading above $115,000, but the recovery comes with a shadow that cannot be ignored. A new gap opened on the CME Bitcoin futures chart, and while the spot market has pushed higher since then, the presence of this gap opens up a bearish scenario. These gaps have a history of pulling Bitcoin back down to fill them, and the most recent one opens up questions about how long the current bullish momentum can last. Bitcoin Opens Up Huge CME Gap Crypto analyst Daan Crypto noted on the social media platform X how Bitcoin opened the week with a huge CME gap that has continued higher since the futures open. This gap is important, as it has been a while since Bitcoin opened with such a huge gap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forms Bearish Evening Star Pattern On Weekly Chart, But Can Price Go Below $100,000? As shown in the chart image below, this CME gap is between $110,000 and $111,300. Gaps on CME futures have a tendency to close fairly quickly, meaning that Bitcoin often retraces to the level of the gap before resuming its trend. If that happens this time, the short-term structure of Bitcoin’s price action could deteriorate into a bearish momentum. However, Daan also noted that this gap should not be considered in play unless Bitcoin drops below $111,000. But if that happens, the futures chart could drag spot prices lower and turn recent strength into weakness. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin? A CME gap occurs because the Chicago Mercantile Exchange does not trade over the weekend, unlike the spot Bitcoin market, which operates 24/7. When Bitcoin makes a big move on Saturday or Sunday, CME futures reopen on Sunday evening at a different level than they closed on Friday, and this leaves an empty gap on the price chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Is Over? These Signals Show Where The Market Is At It’s common knowledge that Bitcoin tends to fill these gaps by returning to the level of the gap before continuing in its trend. If Bitcoin retraces to close this latest gap between the $110,000 to $111,000 range, it would erase the recovery that pushed it to $115,000 and bring the price back into a zone of uncertainty. According to Daan Crypto, if that were to happen here, then the entire structure would look pretty bad in the short term. However, this might be one of those very few gaps that never closes or not until months later. This would most likely be the case, unless Bitcoin breaks below $111,000. A dip below $111,000 could ultimately see Bitcoin losing the $110,000 price level again. If Bitcoin can stay above $115,000 and there’s enough buying pressure, then the gap can be ignored in the short term. The next test will be whether buyers can sustain the recently found momentum and push towards $120,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $116,380, up by 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

This confluence of technical triple-top structure and ETF redemptions increases downside risk while traders watch volume and close below support for confirmation. Triple top chart pattern signals fading bullish momentum and increased breakdown risk. Institutional outflows — roughly $795.6M in one week — reflect waning confidence in spot ETH ETFs. Key supports at $3,900 and $3,850 must hold to avoid potential declines toward $3,600–$2,500 ranges. Ethereum ETF outflows surge; monitor $3,850 support and volume to gauge next move — read Coinotag analysis now. What is driving the recent Ethereum ETF outflows and ETH’s test of $3,850 support? Ethereum ETF outflows accelerated after recent volatility, with institutional investors withdrawing capital and reducing net ETF assets. Combined with a technical triple-top pattern, these outflows increase downside pressure as ETH hovers near the $3,850 support zone, making volume and daily closes critical for direction. How does the triple top pattern affect ETH price action? On the 3-day chart, ETH has formed a triple top where each peak failed to make a strong higher high. This pattern often precedes a decisive move lower when the neckline support is broken. Traders watch for a daily close below the neckline and rising volume as confirmation of a sustained decline. Source: AshCrypto via X (plain text) The triple top’s neckline has been tested multiple times since early 2024. Repeated tests weaken support and raise the probability of a sharp correction if sellers accelerate. Historical precedent suggests that a decisive breakdown can project moves significantly lower — traders should prepare for increased volatility. Why are institutional investors withdrawing from Ethereum Spot ETFs? Institutional outflows can reflect multiple factors: profit-taking, risk-off rotation, or reallocation across portfolios. Data cited by market trackers reports an approximate $795.56 million outflow for the week ending September 26, 2025, indicating meaningful repositioning among large holders. Source: Ted Pillows via X (plain text) Total ETF net assets have contracted to roughly $26.01 billion from intra-year highs above $30 billion, underscoring a shift in institutional sentiment. This capital rotation aligns with the technical weakness and indicates market participants are reducing exposure amid higher short-term risk. Frequently Asked Questions How likely is ETH to break below $3,850 and what are target levels? If ETH closes below $3,850 on higher volume, probability of a move toward $3,600 increases, with a deeper target range near $2,500 if selling momentum persists. Use volume and multi-day closes to confirm the breakout. What metrics should traders monitor during this period of ETF outflows? Watch trading volume, daily closes relative to $3,850 and $3,900 supports, ETF net flows, and open interest across derivatives. These indicators together provide a clearer picture of whether selling is broad-based or transient. Key Takeaways Technical risk : A triple top and repeated neckline tests raise the chance of a meaningful breakdown. Institutional flows : Roughly $795.6M in weekly ETF outflows indicates material repositioning by large investors. Actionable insight : Traders should wait for volume-confirmed closes below $3,850 before assuming a sustained downtrend; otherwise watch for bounces toward $4,060 resistance. Conclusion Ethereum faces a pivotal moment as ETF outflows collide with a bearish triple-top structure near the $3,850 support. Market participants should prioritize objective signals — volume, daily closes, and ETF flow data — before committing to directional trades.

Published: 2025-10-02 | Updated: 2025-10-02 | Author: COINOTAG What is Bullish’s expansion into 20 US states? Bullish’s expansion into 20 US states means the institutionally-focused exchange can now offer regulated spot trading and custody services across major markets after securing a BitLicense and a money transmission license from the New York regulator. The rollout targets hedge funds, market makers, fintechs and advanced traders. How did Bullish secure regulatory approval in New York? Bullish obtained a BitLicense and money transmission license from the New York State Department of Financial Services, a process viewed as stringent and regulatory-intensive. A BitLicense authorizes virtual currency transmission, custody and issuance in New York and is widely recognized as one of the strictest state-level crypto authorizations. Bullish opened trading to two institutional clients on day one: crypto infrastructure provider BitGo and brokerage Nonco, the company said. The platform combines a central limit order book with a deterministic automated market maker to deliver deep liquidity and efficient execution, according to Bullish president Chris Tyrer.

Approved US states include California, Florida, Arizona, Washington, DC and New York, plus Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wyoming and Puerto Rico. What fees and account types does Bullish offer in the US? Bullish is offering 0% maker fees for institutional accounts and 0% trading fees for advanced individual accounts in the 20 approved states. The fee structure is positioned to attract institutional flow and sophisticated retail traders seeking lower execution costs. How large is Bullish’s historic trading footprint? Bullish reports it has processed roughly $1.5 trillion in trading volume internationally since launching in late 2021. It states it ranks among the top ten exchanges by Bitcoin and Ether trading volume globally, despite only now entering broad U.S. markets. “Bullish was created for institutions, and now we’re proud to offer the same level of performance to serious traders across the US,” Bullish said in a statement attributed to company leadership. What was the market reaction to the US launch? Bullish (BLSH) shares declined 4.4% to $60.80 on Wednesday, according to plain text market data from Google Finance. The stock remains more than 60% above its $37 IPO price from mid-August, with an approximate market capitalization of $9 billion on the same data. BLSH’s change in share price on Wednesday. Source: Google Finance Why institutional players are being targeted? Bullish’s product design—central limit order book plus deterministic AMM—aims to deliver predictable liquidity and tight spreads for large orders. The U.S. regulatory approval opens opportunities to onboard hedge funds, prop trading firms, market makers, fintechs and neobanks that require licensed custody and trading services. Frequently Asked Questions Is Bullish fully regulated to operate in the US? Yes. Bullish received a New York BitLicense and a money transmission license which enable it to offer regulated virtual currency transmission and custody services in New York and support expansion into other states where it is licensed. How can institutional clients access Bullish? Institutions can apply for institutional accounts through Bullish’s onboarding process; the platform has already enabled access for BitGo and Nonco as initial institutional users in the US rollout. Will retail traders in non-approved states be able to use Bullish? Not immediately. Trading access is limited to the 20 approved US states and Puerto Rico; Bullish intends to expand coverage as it secures additional state-level authorizations. Key Takeaways Regulatory milestone : Bullish received a NY BitLicense and money transmission license, enabling US operations. Product offering : 0% maker fees for institutions and 0% trading fees for advanced U.S. individuals in approved states. Market scale : Bullish reports $1.5 trillion handled since 2021 and remains a top-ten exchange by BTC/ETH volume. Conclusion Bullish’s US launch represents a major regulatory and commercial step, making its institutional-grade trading and low-fee structure available across 20 states. Market participants should evaluate custody, fees and liquidity before onboarding; expect further state approvals and product rollouts in the coming months. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bullish Launches Trading in 20 US States After NY BitLicense Approval"", ""description"": ""Bullish’s regulated crypto trading is now available in 20 US states after the New York State Department of Financial Services granted a BitLicense and a money transmission license."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199a231-63ee-75d3-ba5a-af690204e173.webp"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T00:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T00:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199a231-63ee-75d3-ba5a-af690204e173.webp"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bullish-launch-20-us-states-2025-10-02""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is Bullish fully regulated to operate in the US?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Bullish obtained a New York BitLicense and money transmission license, enabling regulated crypto transmission and custody services as part of its US expansion."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Which states can access Bullish now?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Bullish is available in 20 US states including California, Florida, Arizona, Washington, DC, New York, and the US territory of Puerto Rico."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What fees does Bullish charge institutions?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Bullish offers 0% maker fees for institutional accounts and 0% trading fees for advanced individual accounts in the approved states."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to start trading on Bullish in approved US states"", ""description"": ""Steps for institutions and advanced traders to access Bullish after its 20-state launch."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199a231-63ee-75d3-ba5a-af690204e173.webp"", ""totalTime"": ""PT1H"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Confirm eligibility"", ""text"": ""Verify that your organization or personal residence is within one of the 20 approved US states or Puerto Rico and prepare required KYC documentation."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Onboard and verify account"", ""text"": ""Complete institutional or advanced individual account registration and submit regulatory and compliance documents for review."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Fund and trade"", ""text"": ""Transfer assets into Bullish custody, confirm fee schedule and start trading with access to institutional liquidity and 0% maker fees where applicable."" } ]}",Bitcoin|News|BTC|FLOW|MKR,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-02 00:15:17

By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $776.48. In 2031, AAVE will range between $1,164.73 to $1,261.79. Aave is a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2025? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $286.93 Market cap $4.38B Trading volume (24-h) $432.83M Circulating supply 15.25M AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $287.88 24-hour high $270.42 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 5.84% 50-day SMA $303.74 14-Day RSI 41.50 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $256.85 Aave 1-day price analysis Key takeaways AAVE is pressing against $287 resistance on both the daily and 4-hour charts. The daily MACD has turned positive, signaling potential for bullish continuation. Aave 1-day price chart On the daily timeframe for October 2, AAVE is trading at $286.98, pressing against the mid-Bollinger band resistance at $287.25. This is a critical level, and closing above it could push AAVE toward the upper band near $318.54. The lower band support at $255.95 provides a safety net, meaning a break below that would flip sentiment bearish again. The MACD has just crossed into positive territory, reflecting strengthening momentum, while recent volume around 30M supports the current breakout attempt. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView If the bulls complete a takeover, AAVE could test $318–$320, though profit-taking pressures may appear there. However, if momentum fades, downside supports at $272 and $256 should be watched closely. Aave 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour timeframe, AAVE surged sharply from $276 to $287, now consolidating just under the resistance level. The Alligator indicator shows widening EMAs, confirming trend strength, while the RSI sits at 66, approaching overbought territory. This suggests buyers remain in control, though momentum is slowing slightly at the consolidation point around $288. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView If AAVE holds above $281 support (the Alligator green baseline), continuation toward $292–$295 looks likely. However, failure to sustain above $286 could trigger a pullback into the $278–$280 range, where the next buy-in opportunity would emerge. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $290.98 SELL SMA 5 $281.04 BUY SMA 10 $283.23 BUY SMA 21 $290.97 SELL SMA 50 $303.74 SELL SMA 100 $294.50 SELL SMA 200 $256.85 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $290.91 SELL EMA 5 $298.53 SELL EMA 10 $306.92 SELL EMA 21 $308.54 SELL EMA 50 $300.32 SELL EMA 100 $283.43 BUY EMA 200 $259.17 BUY AAVE price analysis conclusion AAVE exhibits renewed bullish momentum in the meantime, with momentum indicators turning positive. However, the current price movement suggests the $287–$290 zone remains a decisive barrier. A breakout above this range could drive prices toward $305. If the bears regain control of the market, a retracement toward $278–$280 is expected before another rally attempt. Is AAVE a good investment?

Ripple CTO David Schwartz announced he will step down from daily operations in December 2025 and become CTO Emeritus, joining Ripple’s board while XRP trades at $2.85 amid steady volume and measured market reaction. Ripple CTO David Schwartz will step down in December 2025, moving to the board while staying engaged with the XRP community. XRP price holds steady at $2.85, showing resilience despite a 1.5% decline amid leadership change and market trends. XRP’s trading volume remains strong at nearly $4.9 billion, indicating steady market participation despite a slight cooling in derivative metrics. What does David Schwartz’s departure mean for Ripple and XRP? David Schwartz’s move to CTO Emeritus and a board seat signals a managed leadership transition while preserving technical continuity. Ripple retains Schwartz’s institutional knowledge, and the XRPL developer community expects continued engagement through his node operation and advisory role. How did the market react to the announcement? XRP opened at $2.85 and recorded a modest 1.5% decline the day following the announcement. Trading stayed inside a seven-day band of $2.71–$2.98, with weekly and monthly gains of 1.2% and 4% respectively. The 24-hour trading volume remained robust at about $4.9 billion, suggesting persistent liquidity and investor interest. How are on-chain and technical indicators interpreting the news? On-chain signals and technical indicators point to consolidation. The RSI sits near 45, indicating neutral momentum. Bollinger Bands show reduced volatility, often a precursor to larger price movement. Short-term moving averages hint at mild selling pressure; longer-term 100- and 200-day averages reflect structural strength that could support a move above $2.98 if bullish momentum returns. Why will the transition be gradual and what will Schwartz do next? Schwartz described a phased reduction in day-to-day duties, maintaining technical involvement by running his XRPL node and advising developers. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse emphasized continuity, crediting Schwartz with shaping company culture and long-term technical strategy. The new board role should preserve strategic input without daily operational responsibility. Frequently Asked Questions When will David Schwartz officially step down from daily operations? David Schwartz will step down from daily operations in December 2025 and assume the title CTO Emeritus while joining Ripple’s board of directors. Will Schwartz remain involved with XRP development? Yes. He plans to keep his XRPL node active and remain engaged with developers and the XRP community in an advisory capacity. Is XRP price likely to fall further after the announcement? Current indicators are neutral; short-term pressure was modest (1.5% dip), but strong volume and longer-term moving averages suggest a stable outlook rather than a pronounced decline. Key Takeaways Controlled leadership change : Schwartz moves to CTO Emeritus and a board seat, preserving technical continuity. Price stability : XRP at $2.85, within a seven-day range, backed by strong 24h volume near $4.9B. Watch technical indicators : Neutral RSI and tight Bollinger Bands point to consolidation and possible breakout potential. Conclusion Ripple CTO David Schwartz’s planned transition in December 2025 appears orderly and unlikely to disrupt core development or investor confidence. XRP’s resilient pricing, robust volume, and mixed technical signals suggest the market is absorbing the news while remaining primed for future directional moves.

The initiative will introduce zero-knowledge proof technology and decentralized identity verification across SK Planet’s ecosystem, which serves 28 million users and 95,000 merchant partners. Enterprise-scale decentralized identity Moca Network, a project by Animoca Brands, is building a chain-agnostic identity layer designed to give users ownership of their data while ensuring interoperability across platforms. By integrating AIR Account and AIR Identity, SK Planet aims to allow merchants to verify user information with explicit consent, while ensuring that private data remains under user control. “Partnering with Moca Network enables SK Planet to bring decentralized identity and privacy-preserving verification to our millions of customers and merchant partners,” said Kyosu Kim, chief business officer at SK Planet. “By leveraging AIR Kit and AIR Wallet, we can expand the benefits of OKI Club and reward our users with MOCA Coin while giving them greater control over their data. This is a strategic step forward in aligning with global standards for user privacy and digital identity.” Kenneth Shek, project lead of Moca Network, added: “SK Planet’s purchase of MOCA Coin as well as its integration of AIR Kit infrastructure and adoption of zero-knowledge proofs mark an important milestone in returning data ownership to users at an enterprise scale.” The partnership builds on the February 2025 launch of SK Planet’s OKI Club, which integrated AIR Wallet to let users earn and manage rewards. The company now plans to extend these capabilities with AIR Identity, enabling users to verify credentials and access rewards across multiple platforms, with features including token swaps and staking .

This adjustment has reduced both the number of tokens and the dollar value required to rank among the wealthiest XRP addresses. XRP has experienced notable selling pressure in recent weeks. After reaching a local high of $3.18 on September 13, the asset has since dropped by more than 10%. The decline intensified on September 21, when XRP lost support above the $3 level. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading around $2.84. While the price downturn has been disappointing for many investors, it has also created a less expensive pathway for those aiming to secure a spot on the XRP Rich List . The reduced cost has made it easier to join the top 10%, 5%, and even the top 1% of holders. Top 10% Requirement Falls Below $7,000 To be ranked among the top 10% of XRP addresses, investors now need to hold 2,362 tokens, which equates to approximately $6,708 at current market prices. This marks the first time in several months that the capital needed to reach this threshold has slipped under $7,000. For comparison, in early August, the requirement stood at 2,433 XRP worth $7,299. By the end of that month, the figure dropped slightly to $7,188, followed by a further decline to $7,131 in mid-September. The current $6,708 requirement represents a decrease of nearly $600 in less than two months. Shifts in Other Categories The entry costs for higher-ranked categories on the XRP Rich List have also decreased. For the top 5%, the requirement has fallen from 8,301 XRP ($24,903 as of September 12) to 8,229 XRP, now valued at about $23,370. This change reduces the financial commitment by more than $1,500. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The most exclusive category, the top 1%, has similarly seen a decline. As of September 12, an investor needed 50,025 XRP worth $150,075. Today, the threshold stands at 50,004 XRP, with a market value of $142,011, a $8,000 reduction. Growth in Address Participation Despite the lower thresholds, the number of addresses within these groups has been steadily increasing. Data shows there are currently 705,004 addresses in the top 10%, compared with roughly 352,500 in the top 5%. The top 1% now comprises around 70,500 addresses. Some analysts suggest that the present conditions could offer investors a rare opportunity to strengthen their holdings before potential market shifts. Market commentator Coach JV recently argued that XRP’s next major upward move could occur rapidly and without warning, urging investors to prepare while entry costs remain low. Overall, while XRP’s price struggles have raised concerns among existing holders, the lower thresholds for the XRP Rich List have opened the door for new participants seeking entry into the asset’s upper holding tiers.

Trader Altcoin Gordon cautioned that XRP’s upcoming move might unfold quickly and with force, telling traders to be ready before it takes off. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buyers Step Back After Failed Push Beyond $115,000: Data Price has been stuck below $3 for weeks, and September produced no clear upward momentum, leaving traders on edge as regulators and markets add to uncertainty. Trader Warning Spurs Urgency Short-term charts show XRP compressing after a slide that began in July when the token crossed $3.60. Based on reports, Gordon’s shared chart points to prices tightening toward a breakout point. Compression like this stores volatility. It does not promise an uptrend, but when a move comes it can be abrupt. Some traders see that as an opportunity; others see a risk of chasing a quick spike. Mark my words, the next leg up for $XRP will be fast and aggressive. You’re either positioned BEFORE it happens, or begin for an entry once it does. Connect the dots or stay broke. pic.twitter.com/QCCFxyJe4P — Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) September 29, 2025 Compression And Historical Runs Reports have disclosed that research groups, including Sistine Research, say this is the third major compression since the last US election cycle. Past compressions have been followed by big moves. In late 2024, XRP rose from $0.50 to above $3.40 within weeks — a rapid jump that surprised many. Analysts now point to a range of possible outcomes, with targets that span from $8 to as much as $33 on extreme scenarios based on extensions and past cycle math. Those top-end figures are outliers and should be treated with caution. On-Chain Flows On-chain data from Santiment shows large wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million XRP added over $300 million in three days. Those wallets now hold close to 8 billion XRP, levels last seen in August before earlier rallies. Such accumulation can be bullish, though it can also set up fast squeezes that benefit early sellers. Momentum, ETFs And Market Sentiment Meanwhile, market chatter has been shaped by hopes around potential XRP-based ETFs, with a key US decision expected in October. If approvals arrive, funds could flow in quickly. If regulators delay or deny listings, sentiment could reverse. At the same time, broader crypto strength in Bitcoin and Ethereum has helped lift appetite for large-cap altcoins, and derivatives data shows rising futures volume and open interest around XRP.

52541548,594556,1759366830,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52541548.jpeg,South Korea’s Crypto Scene Shrinks As Traders Flock Offshore: Report,https://bitcoinist.com/south-koreas-crypto-scene-shrinks-as-traders-flock-offshore-report/,"South Korean crypto trading is shifting overseas as domestic exchanges see big drops in fiat deposits and trading activity, according to reports. While user numbers have risen, the money parked in won and the size of local markets have shrunk, signaling that more capital is finding its way to foreign platforms. Capital Flight Accelerating According to Fnnews , KRW deposits held on local exchanges fell by 42% to about ₩6.2 trillion compared with the end of last year. Daily average trading volume also slipped to ₩6.4 trillion, down 12% from the prior half-year. Domestic crypto market capitalization was reported at roughly ₩95.1 trillion, a decline of 14% over the same period, while the global market cap fell by about 7%. At the same time, outflows of crypto reached ₩101.6 trillion overall, with ₩78.9 trillion routed to registered foreign operators — that channel rose by 4%. These figures point to large sums moving beyond Korea’s trading venues. Kimchi Coins Face Listing Pressure Reports have disclosed that exchanges are tightening which tokens they list. The number of unique crypto assets listed domestically is 653, up by 55, but many of those assets trade only on a single platform. There are 279 single-listing assets and about 43% of them have market caps of ₩100 million or less. That level of concentration leaves small tokens exposed to sharp price swings and to delisting risk if liquidity dries up or regulators press for stronger disclosure. User Growth But Smaller Trades User accounts are up to about 10.77 million, an increase of 11% from the prior year-end. Yet average capital per user appears lower, given the fall in KRW deposits and daily volume. Average losses from peak prices have also deepened; the mean maximum drawdown rose to about 72% from 68% previously. In short: more people hold accounts, but less money is staying on local platforms and risk for small holders has increased. Regulatory And Banking Frictions Come Into Play Based on reports, stricter rules and tougher bank partnerships are part of the story. Some exchanges struggle to keep real-name bank accounts or to meet new oversight criteria. When fiat rails are weak, users turn to overseas venues that offer broader token lists and larger pools of liquidity. That has created an incentive for both traders and projects to look beyond the domestic market.

These bitcoin (BTC) options will be margined and settled in the regulated, dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC, which boasts a market cap of $73.85 billion at press time, the second-largest in the stablecoin industry. Additionally, they will be European-style options with expiries ranging from three weeks to three months. The contract multiplier will be 1, meaning one contract represents one full BTC. The exchange plans to list options tied to ether, as well as other single assets and multi-asset indices, such as the CoinDesk 20 and CoinDesk 5, in the future. Bullish's decision to launch options is part of a broader industry trend marked by increasing demand for hedging instruments across the full spectrum of crypto products. This growing appetite is exemplified by the rising popularity of options tied to BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF, which now rivals Deribit's BTC options. ""Bullish is investing significantly in its institutional offering,” said Chris Tyrer, President of Bullish Exchange. “Our journey began with spot trading, expanded to include margin, then perpetual and dated futures, and now reaches a new milestone with the introduction of options."" He added that the new product aims to deliver a complete derivatives product suite with capital efficiency and risk mitigation, all accessible through a single, unified trading account. Options are derivative contracts that grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific asset, such as bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, at a predetermined price within a set time frame. A call option gives the right to buy, representing a bullish bet on the market, while a put protects against potential price losses. The special thing about options is that they facilitate three-dimensional trading, allowing traders to bet on the price direction, the degree of price volatility and leverage time to expiration. This multi-faceted nature enables traders to create synthetic positions by combining spot, futures, and options markets, allowing them to manage risk with more tailored and flexible strategies. Consortium of day-one trading partners Bullish's new options have been designed in close collaboration with leading options market makers, technology providers, and brokers to ensure they are specifically tailored to meet the needs of institutional investors. More importantly, from day one, these options will be supported by a range of confirmed industry heavyweights as trading partners, including Abraxas Capital Management, Ampersan, B2C2, BlockTech, Cumberland, FalconX, Fig Markets, Flow Traders, Galaxy Digital, Monarq Asset Management, Pulsar, SignalPlus, Wintermute, and Qube Research & Technologies. “Galaxy is excited to support the next chapter of Bullish’s journey,” said Jason Urban, Global Head of Trading at Galaxy. “The addition of options to its product suite is a strong step forward – enhancing liquidity, deepening price discovery, and strengthening the overall maturity of the crypto derivatives market.” Unified margin system The global crypto options market is valued at over $50 billion in notional open interest, with Deribit alone accounting for more than 80% of the activity. In other words, the exchange has a massive head start compared to the impending Bullish options contracts. Still, Bullish's announcement stands out due to the platform's unified margin system, according to Tyrer. ""Bullish clients access all products via our unified account structure, allowing them to trade spot, perps, dated futures and now options with risk offsets and portfolio collateralization. This setup is designed for maximum capital efficiency, which is of paramount importance to our institutional client base,"" Chris Tyrer, President of Bullish Exchange, said. On Deribit, Segregated Standard Margin is the default margin system , which means that standard margin, the initial margin and maintenance margin (MM) requirements are calculated separately for each position in the account. These requirements are then summed together to generate the total margin requirements for the account. Lastly, Bullish already has vibrant futures and spot markets, which are often seen as a prerequisite for a successful options product. Since its launch in November 2021, Bullish has surpassed $1.5 trillion in cumulative trading volume. This year, the platform has executed over $2 billion in average daily volume and ranks in the top ten exchanges by spot volume for bitcoin and ether.

Instant in‑kind minting and redemption for tokenized US stocks. Single API call to tokenize portfolios and redeem tokens without cash settlement delays. The tokenized stock market exceeds $700 million; broader tokenization represents over $31 billion onchain. Instant Tokenization Network: Alpaca’s ITN enables institutions to mint and redeem tokenized US stocks in‑kind, 24/7. Explore why this matters for onchain liquidity. What is the Instant Tokenization Network? The Instant Tokenization Network (ITN) is Alpaca’s platform that enables US‑regulated financial institutions to convert portfolios into tokenized US stocks and redeem tokens back into the underlying shares in‑kind . The service offers a single API workflow and 24/7 operational access to speed settlement and improve liquidity. How does Alpaca’s ITN enable in‑kind redemptions? Alpaca’s ITN journals securities between brokerage accounts and delivers tokens to an issuer’s Authorized Participant. Institutions can exchange tokens directly for the underlying shares without first converting to cash. This removes typical settlement windows and aligns tokenized stock mechanics with in‑kind ETF creation/redemption models. The Instant Tokenization Network allows institutions to mint and redeem tokenized US stocks with in‑kind settlement and 24/7 access. US broker‑dealer Alpaca has launched the Instant Tokenization Network (ITN) to let institutions mint and redeem tokenized US stocks directly. The platform targets structural frictions that have limited liquidity in the tokenized equities segment. The ITN provides a single API call to tokenize portfolios and supports in‑kind redemptions, enabling institutions to receive the underlying shares when redeeming tokens. The network operates outside traditional market hours, offering continuous access to token issuance and redemption. The tokenized stock market is currently valued at more than $700 million. Source: RWA.xyz By enabling in‑kind settlement — swapping tokens for the actual securities rather than cash — Alpaca aims to reduce settlement overhead and enhance market efficiency. The approach mirrors in‑kind practices recently approved by regulators for some cryptocurrency exchange‑traded products. Alpaca said the ITN is available to US‑regulated financial institutions and is designed to integrate with custodial and broker‑dealer workflows. Arush Sehgal, Alpaca’s head of crypto, described the ITN as a two‑step API process focusing on journaling securities and delivering tokens to an Authorized Participant. “ITN’s process is best understood as a single API that enables two functions,” Arush Sehgal, Alpaca’s head of crypto, said in a company statement. “First, the journaling of securities to and from brokerage accounts for US‑regulated institutions. Second, delivery of tokens by the issuer to their Authorized Participant.” Alpaca has provided infrastructure for prior tokenization initiatives, including platforms that tokenize stocks and ETFs. The company’s new network extends that work to support fully in‑kind token life cycles. Rob Hadick speaking on the sidelines of TOKEN2049. Source: Andrew Fenton/Cointelegraph Why does in‑kind redemption matter for tokenized stocks? In‑kind redemption reduces counterparty and liquidity risk by ensuring token holders can obtain the underlying shares directly. This mechanism shortens settlement chains and can increase tradability of tokenized equities onchain. Regulators and industry participants have highlighted in‑kind processes as key to scaling tokenized financial products. How big is the tokenization opportunity? Tokenization of real‑world assets has become a major trend in 2025, with industry data showing more than $31 billion represented onchain. The tokenized stock market alone is estimated at over $700 million . These figures signal growing institutional interest but also underscore the need for operational innovations like ITN to deepen liquidity. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/instant-tokenization-network-alpaca-itn"" }, ""headline"": ""Alpaca launches Instant Tokenization Network for in‑kind tokenized US stocks"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/uploads/2025-10/0199a04b-3fc4-7b51-a088-9a801264e738"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T10:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Alpaca's Instant Tokenization Network enables US‑regulated institutions to mint and redeem tokenized US stocks in‑kind, offering a single API and 24/7 access to boost onchain liquidity.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to tokenize a stock portfolio using Alpaca's Instant Tokenization Network"", ""description"": ""Step‑by‑step process for institutional tokenization and in‑kind redemption using ITN."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Prepare securities for journaling"", ""text"": ""Identify eligible US equities and ensure they are held in US‑regulated brokerage accounts for journaling."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Call the ITN mint API"", ""text"": ""Use the single API call to mint tokenized representations of the portfolio to the issuer."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Deliver tokens to Authorized Participant"", ""text"": ""The issuer delivers tokens to the Authorized Participant, who can trade or redeem them onchain."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Execute in‑kind redemption"", ""text"": ""Authorized Participants redeem tokens for the underlying shares, completing settlement without cash conversion."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Who can use Alpaca's Instant Tokenization Network?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The ITN is available to US‑regulated financial institutions such as broker‑dealers and custodians that meet eligibility and compliance requirements."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Does ITN settle token redemptions in cash or shares?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""ITN supports in‑kind redemptions, allowing tokens to be exchanged directly for the underlying shares rather than settling in cash."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will in‑kind settlement improve liquidity?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""In‑kind settlement can shorten settlement chains and reduce frictions, which should improve onchain liquidity for tokenized equities over time."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions Is ITN restricted to US stocks only? Alpaca’s ITN is designed for tokenization of US‑listed equities and currently available to US‑regulated institutions. Expansion to other asset types would depend on regulatory and operational factors. How quickly can tokens be minted and redeemed? The ITN uses a single API to initiate minting or redemption and offers 24/7 access. In‑kind redemption bypasses standard cash settlement windows, speeding the overall process. Key Takeaways Operational efficiency : ITN provides a single API for minting and in‑kind redemption to reduce settlement friction. Liquidity impact : In‑kind processes aim to improve tradability of tokenized stocks and align with recent regulatory precedents. Institutional focus : The network is offered to US‑regulated institutions, emphasizing custody, compliance and control over execution environments. Conclusion The Instant Tokenization Network represents a practical step toward scalable tokenized equities by combining in‑kind settlement, a streamlined API, and 24/7 operations. As tokenization grows beyond $31 billion onchain, ITN’s model could help bridge TradFi requirements and onchain liquidity — a development institutions will watch closely.",News|BTC,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-02 01:05:04

Users will receive notifications of the change from next week. The development highlights the company’s effort to more closely link its significant investments in generative AI to its core online advertising business. Meta ramped up AI hiring and spending over the summer, projecting in its July Q2 earnings report that these initiatives will push higher expense growth in 2026 compared with 2025. The tech giant currently provides generative AI capabilities to users via its digital assistant, which is built across its apps, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Meta AI is also available as a stand-alone app and website. Users can utilize Meta AI the same way they do with OpenAI’s ChatGPT, asking it to provide directions or generate images based on prompts. The Mark Zuckerberg -helmed company also stated that the digital assistant now has more than 1 billion active monthly users. However, this figure does not specifically refer to the digital assistant standalone app. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg said that the digital assistant reached 1 billion monthly active users , and added that eventually “there will be opportunities to either insert paid recommendations” or offer “a subscription service so that people can pay to use more compute.” In the early days of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg and his team famously embraced the motto, “Move fast and break things.” Posters bearing the phrase reportedly lined the walls of the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters, alongside other similarly bold mantras like “Done is better than perfect” and “Fail quicker.” The message was clear for the young company: being first mattered more than getting it right the first time. Voice and text inputs from Ray-Ban Meta glasses feed into the recommendation engine Meta’s privacy and data policy manager, Christy Harris, noted during a media briefing that people already assumed the Facebook parent was incorporating generative AI interactions with ad targeting and content recommendations. “While this is a natural progression of our personalization efforts and will help give us even better recommendations for people, we want to be super transparent about it and provide a heads up before we actually begin using this data in a new way, even if people already thought that we were doing this,” Harris said. Harris illustrated how the update might affect the content and ads shown on Facebook, Instagram, and other Meta platforms. When users discuss family vacation plans with the digital assistant, the assistant’s responses could shape the Reels short videos they are recommended on Facebook. “So the Reels that I see on my Facebook feed or other types of content that are recommended to me could include family-friendly travel destinations,” Harris said. “It could include ads for hotels or other signals that would be informed by the conversation that I have had with Meta AI.” People’s voice interactions with the digital assistant through the company’s Ray-Ban Meta glasses will also influence Meta’s recommendation engine, Harris explained. She said that whether you’re typing your interactions or using the audio version, those signals will still be incorporated. Update goes live December 16, with no opt-put for active users However, the update will not factor in user interactions with Meta AI on WhatsApp unless users link their accounts on the messaging app with other Meta platforms, such as Instagram, Harris added. Users will not have the option to opt out of the recommendation engine changes, but Harris noted that “if they don’t interact with Meta AI, the update won’t apply to them.” The tech giant plans to roll out the recommendation update in the UK and EU “following our usual regulatory updates,” Harris said.

This integrates features that will boost its AI performance. These changes could significantly increase Arm’s revenues and enable Qualcomm’s chips to compete more effectively with its rivals, such as MediaTek and Apple. The semiconductor manufacturer’s decision has clarified earlier controversies raised by individuals regarding whether it will continue to work with Arm technology after a tough legal dispute between the two in 2024. Qualcomm participates in the growing trend of utilizing Arm’s v9 technology Following Qualcomm’s announcement , Arm’s shares substantially surged by 5% during regular trading hours. This left several analysts anticipating that the semiconductor manufacturer will increase Arm’s earnings. Notably, this company charges higher prices for its latest technology. In the meantime, the chipmaker, based in San Diego, California, introduced a new generation of chips for PCs and mobile phones last week. According to information from two sources with knowledge of the situation who wished to remain anonymous, as the talks were confidential, these chips will use Arm’s computing architecture, the ninth version called “v9.” This version includes several enhancements to improve how chips handle tasks such as chatbots and image generation. The main drive behind Qualcomm’s decision is to solidify its position as a leader in the tech ecosystem. The company initiated this focus after realizing that its rival, MediaTek, which sometimes outperforms it, utilizes Arm’s v9 technology. Additionally, most analysts speculated that Apple applied this architecture in its operations. Concerning its widespread adoption in the tech industry, experts have concluded that this technology, referred to as an instruction set architecture, is essential for determining what kinds of programs can run on a central processing unit. Qualcomm did not disclose details regarding Arm’s technology used in its latest chips, but highlighted that it chose the instructions that could benefit its customers. The company also pointed out that the advantage of having its own CPU design team is that it can select the instructions that offer value. Jay Goldberg refers to Qualcomm’s decision as a big development Arm is competing against newer firms like RISC-V, which offers a free open chip standard. However, this technology is much younger than Arm’s, and fewer software developers are utilizing it. Regarding Qualcomm’s decision, the company also had the option to stick with an earlier version of Arm’s technology, as it did for chips released last year. Still, it is hard to say by how much Qualcomm’s decision could grow Arm’s revenue. This is because Qualcomm licenses the computing architecture of Arm but largely designs its chips independently, rather than simply purchasing parts from Arm, according to Jay Goldberg, a senior research analyst for semiconductors and electronics at Seaport Research Partners. Goldberg also mentioned that this was a significant development, as the legal fight was still ongoing. He made these remarks regarding a less than a year ago conflict whereby Arm had threatened to revoke an important license held by Qualcomm, only to pull back from that threat. “This is great news for Arm,” Goldberg said of Qualcomm’s reported efforts, pointing out that “these were companies at war, not friends. Qualcomm could have gone in a totally different direction.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",Tech|Qualcomm,EN,0,0,TECHNOLOGY|REGULATION|RESEARCH|TRADING|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-02 01:25:11

While macro optimism reigns supreme everywhere, there’s a DeFi project that flies under the radar, stepping into the limelight. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , now preselling for $0.035, is drawing whale and retail interest both because of its twofold lending model, as well as its planned stablecoin launch. Though Bitcoin remains the institutional standard, smart money is placing bets early for potential exponential returns, and MUTM’s ruthless presale velocity with over 16,670 holders and $16.6 million raised in capital shows it has the potential to become one of the largest breakout champions of the upcoming cycle. Bitcoin’s Road to $200K Could Rely on the Fed’s Next Giant Move The next big bitcoin rally will be less driven by sentiment and more by macroeconomics, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz feels. In a recent interview, Novogratz explained how one likely change of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to a dovish individual could be the strongest catalyst for the crypto space, and it could push the price of bitcoin all the way to as much as $200,000. The follow-on September 25 basis point Fed cut, year’s first, also elicited a muted price reaction, lowering BTC to around $109,570. But analysts forecast continued monetary accommodation and Fed leadership shake-up to trigger a wholesale reversal of liquidity flows to prepare the ground for Bitcoin’s next parabolic lift. While institutional investors prepare for that contingency, they are also searching for high-leverage wagers that might better the performance of BTC in relative terms and Mutuum Finance is already starting to see that attention. Mutuum Finance Presale Numbers Show High Investor Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a new record set in its Stage 6 presale, and tokens are now worth $0.035, up 16.17% from the previous round. Investor demand remains high, and over 16,670 users and over $16.6 million have been invested up to now, reflecting increasingly strengthened faith in the long-term vision and prospects of the project. Mutuum Finance is offering a $100,000 giveaway to encourage early adopters. Ten lucky participants will receive individual $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, and this project’s vision is thus focused on generating long-term value and aiding in growth in terms of community building. Enhanced Security and Risk Management Mutuum Finance puts maximum focus on security. The platform established a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program to incentivize developers and security researchers to stress test and report bugs. Bugs are graded on a four-step severity level: critical, major, minor, and low, providing full confidence against potential hazards. Mutuum Finance is a risk-weighted Loan-to-Value (LTV) protocol that assigns adequate collateral to every asset according to its riskiness, thereby a more stable and balanced lending process. During periods of market volatility, the protocol features a buffer reserve mechanism, with additional reserves on riskier assets as extra collateral. Real-time dynamic LTV and liquidation ratios are dynamically tuned to meet contemporary market realities so that the protocol is able to respond effectively to volatility. Reserve multipliers are stepped from 10% on lower-risk assets to 35% for higher-risk classes, adding an extra layer of systemic insurance. Efficiency is also of prime importance to Mutuum Finance. Collateral is maximized to create the highest borrowing capacity and correlated assets are utilized to optimize lending and borrowing efficiency. Such frameworks provide low risks of insolvency as well as a stable, sustainable DeFi system. The Next Big Altcoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making it happen with over $16.6M raised, 16,670+ investors, and 50% Phase 6 presale sold for $0.035. The platform offers dual lending, USD-stablecoin collateralized with USD, and strong risk management, i.e., a $50K Bug Bounty. Early birds can also participate in a $100K giveaway.

52543635,594522,1759370441,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52543635.jpeg,Saylor Unveils His Bitcoin Endgame That Could Upend Global Finance,https://bitcoinist.com/saylor-bitcoin-endgame-upend-global-finance/,"In a wide-ranging September interview with Bitcoin Magazine, MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor condensed five years of corporate experimentation into a stark, almost mechanical blueprint for what he calls Bitcoin’s “endgame”: accumulate an unprecedented stockpile of the asset as digital capital, then manufacture a new tier of credit markets on top of it. “The endgame is we accumulate a trillion dollars worth of BTC and then we grow that capital by issuing more credit,” Saylor said . He cast the maneuver not as a speculative side bet but as the next logical phase of corporate finance, with Bitcoin reconstituted as “digital energy” and balance sheets reimagined as engines that spin yield from over-collateralized, Bitcoin-backed instruments. Saylor’s Bitcoin Endgame Plan Saylor’s framing is deliberately elemental. He stitched BTC into a centuries-long lineage of civilization-scale energy breakthroughs—from fire and steel to petroleum and electricity—arguing that the asset’s monetary properties are best understood as a way to move economic “energy” across time and space at light speed. “Bitcoin is hope because Bitcoin represents digital energy,” he said. “A way to convey energy through time, through space… the next paradigm shift.” To Saylor, the institutional misunderstanding of that shift is not a bug but the core of the opportunity. “I would say 95% of the decision makers in the finance world still don’t really embrace or understand the idea of digital energy,” he argued, adding that society’s digestion lag is typical of paradigm shifts: “Bitcoin is evolving faster than society can digest it.” At the heart of the playbook is a simple balance-sheet identity, scaled. Treat Bitcoin as the monetary base—“ digital gold ”—then securitize it as “digital credit” in forms familiar to capital markets: converts, preferreds, money-market-like paper, longer-duration bonds. “If I create a company that buys Bitcoin and I accumulate a billion dollars of Bitcoin, I have a billion dollars of digital capital. What can I do with it? I can issue digital credit,” he said. In Saylor’s model, the equity of a firm that repeatedly performs this cycle becomes “digital equity,” engineered to outperform the underlying asset through conservative leverage and tenor management: “If I want to create a company that’s going to perform 2x Bitcoin, I take the Bitcoin, I issue Bitcoin-backed credit… I create digital equity and the digital equity outperforms the underlying capital asset.” He insists the competitive set is not other Bitcoin treasuries but the vast inventory of 20th-century credit—mortgage, corporate, and sovereign—priced off low or repressed yields and often secured by depreciating or illiquid collateral. “What they’re competing against is the existing credit instruments in the capital market,” Saylor said. The pitch to savers is equally blunt: the “better bank” is one that strips out duration and pays a spread over the fiat status quo, funded by over-collateralized Bitcoin. He sketched it in operational terms: raise equity, buy Bitcoin, then sell short-duration, BTC-secured credit “that just strips the duration to one month… and give people 500 basis points more yield than the risk-free rate in the capital market where you’re selling the credit.” The scale he envisions is not modest. Saylor walked through jurisdictions where financial repression or chronically low policy rates amplify the spread, arguing that mature markets with suppressed yields are the ripest soil for “pure-play digital credit issuers.” Switzerland and Japan were his canonical examples. The aspiration, however, is global. “What if there’s a hundred trillion dollars of digital credit and… 200 trillion worth of digital capital,” he asked, emphasizing that such a structure could remain over-collateralized rather than drift into fractional banking. He also pressed the geopolitical logic: corporate treasuries and well-capitalized exchanges, miners, and custodians become the “first line of economic defense,” lobbying and normalizing Bitcoin within domestic rule-sets the way incumbent industries do. “If you want to win the monetary war you need the institutions that control all the capital and… the support of the government,” he said. Bitcoin Treasury Companies Will Be Banks Saylor was explicit that corporate adoption is already compounding. He traced the cohort of publicly traded balance sheets holding BTC from a single firm in 2020— MicroStrategy —to “two or three… then 10… then 20… then 40… about a year ago there were 60… three months ago there were 120 and right now there’s more than 180,” with the target trajectory moving from “100 to a thousand to 10,000 to 100,000.” He blended that diffusion story with the platform thesis—Bitcoin built natively into iOS, Android, Windows, and consumer hardware—arguing that operating-system-level support is the other clear signal that “digital energy” has fused with the fabric of commerce. Asked about the distributional critique—that corporations crowd out individuals—Saylor inverted the premise, claiming institutional flows have largely accrued to early holders. “When we got involved, Bitcoin was trading $9,000 a coin… today Bitcoin’s $115,000,” he said, attributing much of the appreciation to corporate and ETF demand . “That means that 93% of the gain… went to the individuals that owned the Bitcoin before the corporations got involved.” The rhetoric can be martial—Saylor calls it a “protocol war”—but his operational discipline hinges on avoiding the traps that wrecked miners in the last cycle. Short and expensive liabilities layered onto depreciating hardware was, in his view, the fatal mismatch. The treasury archetype he champions favors mid-to-longer duration capital structures tied to an appreciating base asset. “If you take a mid-duration or long-duration loan and buy an asset appreciating 30 to 60% a year, you’ll probably be fine,” he said, dismissing M&A diversification as value-destructive opacity compared to the “perfect partner” of simply buying more BTC at “one times revenue.” Saylor On US Policy Saylor also pushed the policy and infrastructure horizon, predicting a phased legitimization of tokenized assets while stressing that the “greatest regulatory clarity” remains BTC’s status as a digital commodity that can sit on balance sheets and collateralize credit. He summarized the new political posture in Washington as supportive of making the US a “ global Bitcoin superpower ”—not by nationalizing miners or acquiring equity stakes, but by mainstreaming custody, collateralization, lending, operating-system integration, and tax treatment. “They want the finance companies in the United States to lead the way… and the finance companies in the United States to lead the way in digital assets and digital capital and Bitcoin adoption,” he said. For a community accustomed to debating halvings, hash rate, or on-chain heuristics, Saylor’s endgame centers elsewhere: indexes, coupons, tenors, and yield curves—all re-denominated atop a new monetary base. It is a corporate finance thesis at Bitcoin’s core. And it doubles as a provocation to boards and CFOs in every currency regime: “For every company in the world in any capital market, they’re always better off to buy Bitcoin as their capital asset,” he said. The rest is execution at scale. “Get to a trillion dollars of collateral growing 30% a year, be issuing $100 billion of credit a year, growing 20, 30% a year,” Saylor concluded. “We’re building a better bank.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $116,492.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|FIAT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-02 02:00:41

The political stalemate over health-care funding has 750,000 federal workers on furlough and could cost about $400 million per day, yet risk assets shook off early nerves.

Gold’s sprint to fresh records near $3,875–$3,895/oz underlined the flight-to-safety backdrop, but BTC’s two-day rebound from $112,000 suggests buyers are treating macro uncertainty as a dip-buying opportunity. BTC's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Bitcoin ETF Inflows, “Uptober” Tailwinds, and a Bull-Flag Setup Fueling the rally, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $3.53 billion in net inflows in September, topped by $429.9 million on Sept. 30 (BlackRock, Ark, Fidelity leading). On-chain and derivatives data indicate healthy conditions as leverage resets after the decline, funding levels normalize, and open interest remains steady, allowing BTC to resume its upward trend. Technical analysts point to a multi-week bull flag with the price now pushing against the upper boundary, mirroring patterns seen before previous impulsive moves. Seasonality also favors the market, with “Uptober” traditionally showing strong performance after a positive September close. Telegram’s Pavel Durov even revived long-term optimism, reaffirming a $1 million BTC target driven by fixed supply versus money printing, sentiment often seen during mid-cycle expansions. Bitcoin’s Key Levels to Watch Out In the near term, Bitcoin resistance is around $117,500. A clear reclaim and daily close above this level could pave the way toward $119,300–$120,300, with a psychological target near $ 120,000. Order-book heatmaps indicate significant short liquidity between $118,000 and $119,000 (about $7 billion), which could trigger a squeeze if this level is broken. On the downside, bulls aim to defend the $114,800–$115,200 zone first, then the $112,000 pivot identified before the bounce; below that, there’s a larger liquidity pocket at $107,000–$108,000 (roughly $8 billion in long liquidations).

BNB breakout past $670 signals renewed accumulation and shifting market sentiment. Strong support at $900 underpins the rally while $1,050 is the immediate resistance to watch. Futures open interest near $1.82B and 24h futures volume of $1.71B show elevated trader participation. BNB price holds above $900 support; discover resistance levels, open interest signals and next trade targets — read actionable analysis now. Binance Coin (BNB) demonstrates firm momentum, defending the $900 base after a decisive breakout above the $670 ceiling. Continued strength and rising futures open interest suggest a clear path toward $1,050 — break and sustained follow-through could target $1,200 and $1,600. What is driving the BNB price breakout? BNB price strength is driven by renewed accumulation after breaking the $670 resistance, higher trading volumes and expanding futures open interest, which together reflect increased speculative confidence and stronger buyer conviction above the $900 support level. How can traders interpret technical levels and market signals? Short-term technical structure shows consolidation above $900 with immediate resistance at $1,050. Key signals to monitor: rising open interest (currently ~ $1.82B), positive funding rates across most venues, and healthy spot volume (~ $240.8M). These factors suggest momentum, but abrupt funding spikes (e.g., Gate.io) can precede short corrections. Breakout Momentum Gathers Pace After months confined to a $570–$670 range, BNB recorded a meaningful breakout in mid-2025 that pushed price action higher on above-average volume and clear buying pressure. That shift marks a structural change from range-bound trading to trend-seeking behavior. Source: Ali Charts Via X BNB is trading around $1,011, up roughly 4% on the day, with a one‑month gain near 17% and a 90‑day return of about 54%. The prior resistance near $770 has shifted to support, reinforcing the bullish base. $1,050 Resistance in Focus The $1,050 zone has produced repeated seller reactions, evidenced by recent wicks. A clean, sustained close above $1,050 is the technical trigger many traders will use to target the next levels at $1,200 and $1,600. Conversely, losing $900 would weaken the bullish setup. Market data points to elevated participation: futures open interest sits at approximately $1.82 billion (Coinglass data referenced as plain text), 24‑hour futures volume reached $1.71 billion with Binance accounting for a large share, and spot volume remains healthy at roughly $240.8 million. Funding rates are mostly positive; Gate.io’s spike near 10.59% highlights potential short-term overleverage. Market Cap Consolidates After Profit-Taking BNB’s market capitalization rallied toward $150B after the breakout before facing profit-taking. It retraced below $138B and is now consolidating around $135B. A push above $138B would likely validate further upside toward $144B and higher, while a drop under $134B could prompt a test of $130B. How should traders manage risk around a BNB breakout? 1) Set a protective stop below the $900 support to preserve structure. 2) Scale position size on a confirmed close above $1,050. 3) Monitor funding rates and open interest for signs of overheating. 4) Use trailing stops if momentum accelerates to $1,200 or beyond. Frequently Asked Questions What price levels should traders watch for BNB in the short term? Key levels: support at $900 and $770; immediate resistance at $1,050. A sustained close above $1,050 targets $1,200 and $1,600, while losing $900 could prompt a retest of $770 and lower support zones. Is rising open interest bullish for Binance Coin? Rising open interest typically signals increased leverage and trader commitment, which can support bullish moves. However, sudden funding spikes may precede short-term corrections, so watch open interest alongside funding rates and volume. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/articles/bnb-breakout-2025"" }, ""headline"": ""BNB price holds above $900 as bulls defend support; $1,050 resistance in focus"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-2-1024x716.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""BNB price holds above $900 support and tests $1,050 resistance; open interest and volume suggest bullish momentum with targets at $1,200 and $1,600.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is driving the BNB price breakout?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Renewed accumulation after breaking the $670 ceiling, higher trading volumes and expanding futures open interest are driving the breakout, supported by strong $900-level demand."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Which technical levels matter most for BNB now?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Support at $900 and $770, with immediate resistance at $1,050.

The leading cryptocurrency has risen nearly 4% in the past 24 hours, with prices briefly rising to $119,455 for the first time since mid-August, CoinDesk data show. Other major tokens such as ether (ETH), XRP (XRP), solana (SOL) and dogecoin (DOGE) have risen 4% to 7%. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) has jumped 5% to 4,217 points. The rally follows a U.S. government shutdown on Wednesday after a deeply divided Congress prevented officials from reaching a funding deal. The shutdown could delay Friday's nonfarm payrolls report, the official monthly jobs figure, which would eventually set the stage for a positive liquidity impulse or expansion of liquidity in the financial system. This often results in easier access to funding, reduces cost of borrowing and encourages economic growth and risk-taking in financial markets. ""If ADP is a leading signal and the BLS print is delayed, the Fed is likely to deliver a 25 bp cut in October and pair it with guidance that keeps a second cut on the table by December, alongside an early nod toward tapering quantitative tightening (QT). That mix should pull real yields lower and soften the dollar into Q4, with a mild bear-steepening in the curve and gold staying bid. Net effect: a positive liquidity impulse that historically supports BTC,"" Matt Mena, Crypto Research Strategist at 21Shares said in an email. Wednesday's ADP private payrolls report painted a bleak picture of the labor market, strengthening the case for continued rate cuts by the Fed. The central bank cut rates by 25 basis points last month, while hinting at additional easing in the coming months. Mena added that BTC's price gain in the wake of the government shutdown could be a hint of an impending explosive rally. ""The message is clear: with traditional data releases in flux and macro uncertainty running high, Bitcoin remains one of the few assets that thrives when the old playbook breaks down. Investors should be watching this moment closely - it could mark the next explosive leg higher in crypto markets,"" he noted. Options look cheap One way to play the impending big move, while being hedged, could be through Deribit-listed options, which look cheap at the front-end, according to Amberdata's Director of Derivatives Greg Magadini. ""After a long 'dry spell' for BTC volatility, the U.S. government shutdown could finally be the catalyst to make BTC move a lot,"" Magadini told CoinDesk. ""This, coupled with the steep contango in implied volatility term structure, makes options look cheap."" The steep contango in the implied volatility (IV) term structure, represented by an upward-sloping IV curve from near-term to longer-term maturities, indicates that the market expects future volatility to be significantly higher than the near-term volatility. This makes near-term options relatively cheap. Option prices are influenced by implied volatility. Magadini cited long straddle as one of the preferred strategies to play the impending volatility boom. It involves the simultaneous purchase of both call and put options at the same strike price and with the same expiry. The call option gains value when the underlying asset’s price rises, while the put option provides protection against price declines. Together, this means the straddle buyer profits from significant price movements in either direction. ""The USD is likely to see flows on the back of the Shutdown and this week's payroll number... which will guide the Fed. These catalysts could either cause BTC to rally (as a dollar hedge) or crash (if risk assets panic),"" he said, explaining the bias for straddle.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|cryptocurrencies|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-02 02:14:52

The recent introduction of new listing standards is also adding further uncertainty to the timeline because the experts don’t know how quickly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will act under the new rules. Shutdown Risk Stalls Crypto ETF Momentum Over the last few months, several asset managers have been actively engaging with the SEC and updating their S-1 registration forms. These revisions are often seen as a sign that the regulator is getting closer to giving the green light for an investment product. However, a federal shutdown would pause most of this progress. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, wrote on X that three issuers believe next week could be a realistic window for a spot SOL ETF green light, though he cautioned that government closure might disrupt the process. James Seyffart shared the same sentiment, suggesting that things could get “wonky.” Congress has yet to reach an agreement on the budget for the new fiscal year, and if the deadline passes without a deal, the U.S. government will face a shutdown. This would force many federal agencies, including the SEC, to suspend most of their operations until funding is restored. The financial watchdog confirmed in a September 30 statement that if the government comes to a standstill, it will be unable to fast-track the approval of registration statements like S-1 filings. In such a situation, the SEC’s database would continue to receive submissions, but staff furloughs would mean suspending non-essential reviews. Since crypto ETFs are unlikely to be considered “essential,” their review process would be put on hold until normal operations resume. New Listing Guidelines Could Affect Timeline A possible government closure is not the only factor shaping the launch schedule for these investment products. Journalist Eleanor Terrett reported that the SEC has asked LTC, XRP, SOL, ADA, and DOGE ETF issuers to withdraw their 19b-4 filings since these are no longer required under the new generic listing standards. She also said that withdrawals could begin soon, although it is still unclear how quickly the regulator will act on pending applications under the new rules. Under the previous process, deadlines for several ETFs, including SOL, XRP, and DOGE, were supposed to begin this month. Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, CoinShares, Bitwise, Grayscale, VanEck, and Canary Capital are currently in the race to launch spot SOL ETFs, with the firms submitting amended S-1 documents that also include staking provisions to the SEC last week. Following the development, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas had said that approval odds for altcoin ETFs were “really 100% now.” The post Analysts Warn Government Closure May Delay Solana ETF Approval appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Crypto ETF|SEC|Solana|United States,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|DOGE,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-02 02:20:00

Tenev told the crowd at the Token2049 conference in Singapore that tokenization is a “freight train” barreling toward the heart of traditional finance. “Crypto and traditional finance have been living in separate worlds, but they’ll fully merge. In the future, everything will be on-chain in some form, and the distinction will disappear,” he said. With Robinhood now offering tokenized stocks in Europe as well as private shares in some of the hottest non-public startups like OpenAI , the firm is betting big on a future where assets trade 24/7, on-chain, and globally. “In the same way that stablecoins have become the default way to get digital access to dollars, tokenized stocks will become the default way for people outside the U.S. to get exposure to American equities,"" Tenev said on stage. ""That’s why we launched our stock tokens in Europe first, it’s the future of how global investors will hold U.S. assets.” Even though many in the crypto industry have praised the direction the U.S. is going on digital asset policy, Tenev said the country needs to play regulatory catch-up to Europe. There's no urgency to change things – such as creating regulations to facilitate 24/7 trading of tokenized stocks – because the current system works well enough already. Tenev compared it to the lack of high-speed trains in the U.S., something ubiquitous in Europe and Asia. “The biggest challenge in the U.S. is that the financial system basically works. It’s why we don’t have bullet trains — medium-speed trains get you there well enough,"" he said. ""So the incremental effort to move to fully tokenized will just take longer.” Tokenizing real estate Next up for Robinhood is tokenizing real estate. Tenev told the crowd that tokenizing property is “mechanically” no different from tokenizing a private company, such as SpaceX or OpenAI: you place the assets into a company structure and then issue tokens against it. While OpenAI called the move to tokenize its private shares "" unauthorized "" and crypto lawyers that spoke to CoinDesk said the move walked a legal tightrope , Tenev dismissed the controversy as part of a broader regulatory lag, arguing that the main hurdles aren’t technical but legal. Europe is already moving ahead, he said, while the U.S. will likely trail, but he framed real estate as the next logical step in Robinhood’s tokenization push — an asset class that could one day be traded as easily as a stock or stablecoin.

SEC pause halts non-emergency reviews of ETF filings during the shutdown. More than 90 spot and altcoin ETF applications are affected, including Solana- and XRP-focused funds. Bitcoin ETFs now manage about $150B AUM; Ethereum funds exceed $22B, per CoinGlass analytics. Meta description: SEC halts review of spot crypto ETF applications amid government shutdown; investors should expect delays. Read key impacts and next steps from COINOTAG. What does the SEC pause mean for spot crypto ETF approvals? The SEC has halted non-emergency review and approval of financial products during the partial government shutdown, meaning applications for spot crypto ETFs — including proposals tied to Solana, XRP, Cardano, Litecoin and Dogecoin — will be delayed until the agency restores full staffing and funding. How many ETF applications are affected and which tokens are involved? The SEC is currently processing more than 90 applications for ETFs based on spot prices of altcoins, token combinations and other digital-asset strategies. Issuers have proposed funds tied to Solana, XRP, Cardano, Litecoin, Dogecoin and other tokens. Bloomberg analysts had flagged Solana-focused approvals as likely earlier in October, but the shutdown makes that timeline uncertain. Why did the SEC suspend reviews during the shutdown? Under its contingency operations plan, the SEC limited personnel and paused routine, non-emergency support and reviews to preserve essential functions during a lapse in appropriations. The agency described the suspension as temporary “until further notice” while Congress resolves the budget impasse. What is the market context for these ETF filings? The rush of filings follows strong investor demand driven by the success of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. According to CoinGlass analytics, 11 Bitcoin funds now manage roughly $150 billion in assets under management (AUM). Ethereum spot funds have surpassed $22 billion in AUM. Solana’s market cap sits above $118 billion , and the token recently traded above $222 amid a broader crypto market upswing. What are experts saying about the delay? Industry observers warned of immediate impact. Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted the market was anticipating “crypto ETF approval season.” ETF Institute co-founder Nate Geraci commented that a shutdown “would definitely impact the launch of new spot crypto ETFs,” noting that planned timelines such as an October rollout—dubbed “ETF Cryptober” by some—may be postponed. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/sec-halts-review-spot-crypto-etf-applications"" }, ""headline"": ""SEC Halts Review of Spot Crypto ETF Applications During Government Shutdown"", ""description"": ""The SEC paused non-emergency reviews of more than 90 spot and altcoin ETF applications amid a partial government shutdown, delaying expected approvals."", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will the SEC resume ETF reviews once the shutdown ends?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

The SEC pause pauses active review and approval processes, so any planned launch dates tied to pending approvals are likely to shift. Issuers and market participants should expect delays until the agency returns to full operations. How long will approvals be delayed? Duration depends on how quickly Congress resolves the budget impasse. The SEC has stated reviews are suspended “until further notice,” but historically such pauses end once appropriations are restored; there is no fixed timeline. Key Takeaways Immediate delay : The SEC paused non-emergency ETF reviews during the shutdown, affecting 90+ applications. Market context : Bitcoin ETFs manage ~ $150B AUM; Ethereum funds exceed $22B, highlighting strong investor demand. Next steps : Monitor SEC notices, issuer updates, and filing records; expect approvals to resume after funding is restored. Conclusion The SEC’s suspension of non-emergency reviews amid the partial government shutdown has put a temporary hold on approvals for spot crypto ETF applications, including many altcoin proposals. Investors and issuers should monitor official SEC statements and filing records. COINOTAG will provide updates as the agency resumes normal operations and timelines solidify. “Looks like a prolonged government shutdown would definitely impact the launch of new spot crypto ETFs… ETF Cryptober might be on hold for a bit.” — Nate Geraci (ETF Institute), October 1, 2025.

Bitcoin forms a bullish flag, with analysts eyeing $140K and Fibonacci targets near $166K. On-chain data shows buyer dominance as Spot Taker CVD flips positive after mid-July. October and November are viewed as breakout months, backed by seasonal strength and liquidity. Bitcoin is showing chart structures that align with another bullish rally. Current technical formations reveal a bullish flag pattern , and analysts point to October and November as potential catalysts for stronger upward momentum. Market participants are tracking key levels while historical data supports seasonal strength in this period. What does the bullish flag formation mean for Bitcoin price targets? Bitcoin has moved inside a descending channel since August 2023, forming a corrective flag that often precedes continuation. Analysts project an initial target near $140,000 with extended Fibonacci projections up to $166,546 if resistance breaks decisively. Captain Faibik’s charting highlights consistency with prior consolidations that preceded major rallies. Support and resistance within the channel continue to dictate near‑term price action and risk management levels. $BTC is getting Ready for Another Bullish Rally.. I think October & November are gonna be Bullish Months.. Before the Breakout, if we get a dip, that would be a very good Opportunity.. #Crypto #Bitcoin #BTCUSD pic.twitter.com/Kt3UTl1VLv — Captain Faibik (Twitter) October 1, 2025 Technical projections indicate that once resistance breaks, price expansion could target the $140,000 level. Earlier in 2023, Bitcoin exited a similar descending channel and delivered a sharp upward continuation. The repeating behavior signals alignment with a continuation pattern that has appeared across multiple market cycles. Source: KamranAsghar (X) Kamran Asghar also mapped Fibonacci extension targets that reinforce these levels. His analysis showed resistance near $127,568 , extending toward $142,831 and $166,546 . This sequence reflects progressively higher projections, supported by the ongoing formation of higher highs and higher lows in the daily chart. How do liquidity and seasonal patterns support a breakout? Bitcoin is currently trading at $116,702, recording a 3.16 percent increase in 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Daily trading volume stood at $62.75 billion, with circulating supply at 19.92 million BTC and market capitalization near $2.32 trillion — metrics that point to strong liquidity. Source: CoinMarketCap On‑chain indicators show steady accumulation across exchanges, with the Spot Taker CVD flipping positive since mid‑July. This metric captures the balance between aggressive buying and selling; the current positive trend confirms buyer dominance. At the same time, the Coinbase premium index indicates persistent spot demand from U.S. investors. Historical seasonality also matters: when Bitcoin ends September positively, subsequent multi‑month rallies are more common. October — often called “Uptober” — has averaged gains exceeding 20 percent in multiple years. With the flag intact and seasonal momentum approaching, analysts assign higher odds to breakouts in October and November. Frequently Asked Questions What entry and stop levels do analysts recommend for a flag breakout? Traders commonly enter on a confirmed daily close above channel resistance with stop losses below the recent flag low. Initial profit targets use the flagpole height, then Fibonacci extensions for extended targets such as $142k and $166k. How reliable is Spot Taker CVD for confirming breakouts? Spot Taker CVD is a directional liquidity indicator; a sustained positive flip suggests net buying pressure and improves breakout reliability when combined with price and volume confirmation. Key Takeaways Bullish flag identified : A descending channel since August reads as a continuation pattern with a $140K initial target. On‑chain confirmation : Spot Taker CVD flipping positive signals buyer dominance supporting sustainable moves. Seasonal and liquidity edge : Strong trading volume and historical October–November strength increase breakout probability; use progressive Fibonacci targets and risk management. Conclusion This analysis finds that the Bitcoin bullish flag , reinforced by Fibonacci projections and positive on‑chain indicators, supports a plausible path toward $140,000 and higher extensions. Traders should combine technical breakout confirmation with on‑chain signals and seasonal context, and monitor liquidity and volume for sustained moves.",Analysis|Bitcoin|News|BTC,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-02 02:55:59

Bitcoin Rises Despite US Government Shutdown The US federal government shut down at midnight on September 30, as President Donald Trump and Congress failed to reach a deal on funding. Specifically, the two camps were at odds over enhanced Obamacare subsidies, with neither party willing to take the blame. Related Reading: Bitcoin Momentum Indicator: Why 600,000 Transactions Threshold Matters Most However, Bitcoin made a surprise move to the upside despite the uncertain environment created by the US government shutdown, recording strong gains earlier today. CryptoQuant analyst Kripto Mevsimi stated that September saw deeper losses among short-term holders (STH), as their Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) fell as low as 0.992. As a result, most of September was marked by STH continuing to sell their BTC holdings at a loss. However, the metric recovered slightly to 0.995, although it is still below August’s reading of 0.998. The current STH-SOPR reading is showing signs of stabilization after a period of depression. It is interesting to note the timing of this recovery, as it occurred at a time when BTC is trading in the high $110,000 range, slightly below a heavy resistance zone. Past data shows two potential scenarios that can happen following such a reset in the STH-SOPR. First, it could be early warning signs of a weakening momentum for BTC, as extended loss realization can precede corrective phases where weak hands capitulate. The other, more bullish scenario, is that it could be a healthy reset. Quick absorption of realized losses often paves the way for more sustainable rallies, which could catapult BTC to new all-time highs (ATH) in the near term. The CryptoQuant analyst added: With BTC consolidating under resistance, this rebound in STH-SOPR is a key barometer of market health. If buyers continue to absorb weak-hand selling, it could mirror past resets that paved the way for the next leg higher. Will BTC Decline In Q4 2025? While the dwindling active circulating supply of Bitcoin offers some hope to the bulls, others are not as optimistic. According to recent analysis by fellow CryptoQuant contributor Axel Adler, demand for BTC cooled after it failed to hold above $115,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Go To Zero, Hedge Fund CEO Warns Meanwhile, crypto analyst Doctor Profit recently remarked that BTC is likely to experience another 20% decline from its current price, reaching his projected target range between $90,000 – $94,000.

World Liberty Financial To Launch Debit Card Pilot Program During a presentation at the Token 2049 conference in Singapore, World Liberty Financial’s CEO, Zach Witkoff, shared these developments alongside co-founder Donald Trump Jr., highlighting the company’s commitment to bridging cryptocurrency with everyday transactions. Witkoff revealed that the forthcoming debit card, designed to facilitate crypto asset spending in daily life, is set to enter a pilot program in the next quarter, with a launch anticipated either in the fourth quarter of this year or the first quarter of 2026. This announcement follows previous hints from Zak Folkman, World Liberty Financial’s co-founder, about a debit card and retail application during Korea Blockchain Week 2025 , although the details of the consumer app remain under wraps for now. In addition to the debit card, Witkoff emphasized the company’s focus on the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). “We’ve not only thought about it, we’re actively working on it,” he stated, noting that assets such as oil, gas, cotton, and timber could benefit from being traded on-chain. As part of its roadmap, the firm also introduced a stablecoin called USD1 . Since its launch, USD1 has rapidly ascended to become the fifth-largest stablecoin globally, boasting a market capitalization of approximately $2.7 billion. USD1’s Role Amid Political Scrutiny In response to President Donald Trump being scrutinized by Democratic lawmakers in the US, Donald Trump Jr. emphasized the venture and USD1’s role in supporting US treasuries and maintaining the dollar’s global dominance. He stated: We’re flying to every single corner of this globe, convincing people to onboard to USD1, which, in effect, convinces those people to go buy US Treasuries, and it’s great for the US dollar. WLFI also announced plans to expand the USD1 stablecoin onto the Aptos (APT) blockchain. Despite facing challenges, including subdued demand on centralized exchanges (CEXs), the stablecoin has gained traction on decentralized platforms, although concerns remain regarding liquidity concentration among a few major wallets. In August of this year, World Liberty Financial revealed a partnership with the technology firm ALT5 Sigma. As part of a treasury strategy, ALT5 Sigma will acquire substantial amounts of WLFI tokens, following Strategy’s (formerly MicroStrategy) acquisition of Bitcoin. On Wednesday, WLFI posted gains of 2%, reaching the $0.200 mark, which has proven to be a major obstacle for the token’s price, as it has been unable to surpass this level for several days.

In the video , an Eastnets representative explained how the company’s PaymentSafe platform serves as a payment hub capable of unifying transactions across domestic, international, and SWIFT networks. The speaker described PaymentSafe’s universal translator as critical for exchanging different payment formats, mentioning the legacy MT standard alongside the ISO 20022 format , including CBPR+. SMQKE shared the video with a caption that asserted that Ripple is “actively being integrated into SWIFT,” emphasizing that third-party partnerships such as EastNet and Ripple, “are key to enabling XRP to move across the SWIFT network as an ISO 20022-compliant asset.” This remark has framed the discussion about how Ripple’s technology can function within long-standing banking infrastructure. RIPPLE IS ACTIVELY BEING INTEGRATED INTO SWIFT Third-party partnerships like Eastnets and Ripple are key to enabling XRP to move across the SWIFT network as an ISO 20022-compliant asset. Eastnets’ PaymentSafe platform connects Ripple’s blockchain technology with SWIFT’s… pic.twitter.com/2fsEpeH8NR — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 30, 2025 PaymentSafe’s Role in Bridging Networks The remarks in the video placed PaymentSafe at the center of ongoing efforts to align blockchain-based payment solutions with traditional rails. By acting as a translator for payment formats, PaymentSafe facilitates smoother Straight-Through Processing (STP) for financial institutions. Its compliance with ISO 20022 enables interoperability between newer blockchain systems like Ripple and legacy infrastructures, such as SWIFT, which continue to rely on MT messages during their transition. According to SMQKE, this configuration “ connects Ripple’s blockchain technology with SWIFT’s traditional financial systems.” The post further claimed that the integration enables XRP to act as a bridge currency, facilitating cross-border payments through SWIFT’s global network. Emphasis on Seamless Integration for Banks The post highlighted the adoption of innovative technologies without overhauling their existing frameworks as a shared priority among financial institutions. PaymentSafe’s hub reportedly enables banks to tap into Ripple’s blockchain without disrupting established processes. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This point is a strategic advantage for institutions that are cautious about moving away from entrenched payment structures while seeking faster, lower-cost cross-border settlements. Positioning XRP as a Bridge Currency The narrative from SMQKE’s post aligns with a growing perception that XRP can serve as an efficient bridge currency and settlement asset for global transfers. As international banking continues to move toward ISO 20022 standards, partnerships that bring together traditional payment networks and blockchain solutions appear increasingly relevant. With platforms like PaymentSafe facilitating communication between the SWIFT network and Ripple’s blockchain, the opportunity to expand XRP’s role in settlement appears more feasible for institutions reluctant to adopt entirely new infrastructures.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.7092 Market cap $750.94M Trading volume (24-hour) $23.98M Circulating supply 1.06B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.7101 24-hour low $0.6699 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 5.39% 50-day SMA $0.7561 14-Day RSI 35.78 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Green days 17/30 (57%) 200-day SMA $0.7040 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Tezos has rebounded from $0.63 and is now testing the $0.72 resistance zone. The daily MACD is nearing a bullish crossover, signaling growing momentum. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart On the daily timeframe for October 2, Tezos (XTZ) is trading at $0.708, pushing into the mid-Bollinger resistance at $0.723 after bouncing strongly from the lower band support at $0.630. The MACD is on the verge of a bullish crossover, sitting almost flat, suggesting that momentum is gradually shifting to the upside. The OBV has ticked higher, indicating improving volume backing the current push. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView If XTZ secures a daily close above $0.723, the next upside target lies at the upper Bollinger level near $0.815. However, failure to clear this resistance could result in a retest of $0.685–$0.690, with deeper support located at $0.630. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, Tezos has staged a steady rally from $0.660 to $0.709, forming higher lows and higher highs. The Alligator lines are widening, signaling that the short-term uptrend is gaining strength. RSI is at 69, just a touch below overbought, meaning momentum remains positive but could face short-term cooling if buyers slow down. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView Support lies at $0.690–$0.687, which has now flipped into a key level to watch. As long as XTZ holds above that range, continuation toward $0.720–$0.725 is expected. A strong breakout there would confirm the daily view, targeting $0.760 and higher. If XTZ is rejected at $0.720–$0.725, the price may consolidate between $0.685 and $0.705 before another move. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6943 BUY SMA 5 $0.6973 BUY SMA 10 $0.7119 SELL SMA 21 $0.7430 SELL SMA 50 $0.7561 SELL SMA 100 $0.7344 SELL SMA 200 $0.7040 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7172 SELL EMA 5 $0.7277 SELL EMA 10 $0.7487 SELL EMA 21 $0.7756 SELL EMA 50 $0.7714 SELL EMA 100 $0.7378 SELL EMA 200 $0.7442 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos is showing breakout strength after a strong rebound, but the $0.72 level is the key level to watch. A clear break above it could extend gains toward $0.76 and potentially $0.81, while failure there risks a pullback to $0.685–$0.690. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin recovered in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite its partnership milestones, Tezos (XTZ) had a bearish 2024. The coin peaked at $1.4 in April but dropped about 60% by August. Buyers returned in September, driving the price to $0.7015, and momentum carried into November with a peak of $1.856. The rally extended to December, when XTZ reached $1.909 before corrections brought the year-end close to $1.286.

Broad altcoin season unlikely: Bitcoin-led rallies are not spilling over to most altcoins. Market cycles are shorter and narrative-driven; only sector-specific tokens may outperform.

Altcoin season appears unlikely in the short term, says Bitget operating chief Vugar Usi Zade. Bitcoin’s independent rally and a lack of major technological catalysts for altcoins reduce the probability that “everything will go up” together. How is Bitcoin decoupling affecting altcoins? Bitcoin’s rally has increasingly operated independently, weakening historical correlations with altcoins. According to on-stage comments at Token2049, Bitcoin can be green while the broader market is red — funds are not cascading from BTC into altcoins as before. Market-share data shows Bitcoin at about 58% dominance while Ether sits near 12% (CoinMarketCap). This concentration limits capital rotation into smaller tokens without clear, narrative-driven catalysts. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/2025/10/02/altcoin-season-bitget-usi-zade"" }, ""headline"": ""Altcoin season unlikely as Bitcoin decouples — Bitget executive analysis"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199a2da-e86d-705f-a6b4-b70b579284b1.jpeg""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-02T10:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-02T10:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Bitget operating chief Vugar Usi Zade says a broad altcoin season is unlikely as Bitcoin decouples and projects lack major technological catalysts.""} A broad altcoin rally is unlikely, as crypto projects haven’t generated enough excitement to stir traders into action, Bitget operating chief Vugar Usi Zade tells Cointelegraph. The crypto markets are unlikely to see an altcoin season where “everything will go up,” as many traders are now focused on narrower trends or are just focusing solely on Bitcoin, according to Bitget operating chief Vugar Usi Zade. “I don’t think there will be an altseason,” Usi Zade told Cointelegraph at the Token2049 conference in Singapore on Wednesday. “The whole idea that ‘this is altseason and everything will go up because it’s altseason,’ we won’t see that, and I’m very firm in that,” he said. “I don’t think we will see that huge pump, unfortunately, because there’s no logical reason behind it.” “There haven’t been any technological advancements. We haven’t seen any big things coming out of projects. Why would the price go up? Just because now it is the time? It’s not.” Historically, altcoins — crypto tokens other than Bitcoin (BTC) — have rallied alongside Bitcoin. Altcoin season refers to periods when altcoins outperform Bitcoin due to higher risk-to-reward profiles. Why are crypto “seasons” changing? Usi Zade said the crypto market is “moving very much away from seasons,” shifting toward shorter, more frequent cycles. Bitcoin no longer reliably drags the rest of the market up. “Bitcoin is its own rally; its impact is almost zero on the rest of the market,” he said. “Bitcoin decoupled not only from the stock market, but it also decoupled from altcoins.” “We’ve seen so many instances that Bitcoin is the only one in the green, and then the entire market is red. Money is not flowing from Bitcoin down to the alts.” Vugar Usi Zade speaking on stage at Taipei Blockchain Week in September. Source: Vugar Usi Zade Rallies today are more likely to be narrative-driven. For example, tokens tied to real-world assets (RWA) may see concentrated gains while unrelated sectors remain flat. How must market attitudes change for sustainable altcoins? Usi Zade argues investors’ short-term mindset makes long-term project sustainability difficult. Expecting crypto ventures to reach profitability within months is unrealistic compared to legacy companies that took years. “It took Amazon more than 10 years to become profitable, and now we want a crypto venture to do that in eight months,” he said. That pressure forces projects to prioritize short-term token performance over product development. Unlike traditional exits where early investors sell to strategic firms, tokens are often immediately tradable by retail, increasing volatility and reducing runway for teams to build. “The token is a separate product. You need to work with the traders and make sure that you are traded and your price doesn’t go down because when your price reaches virtually zero, your product, or your project, is dead,” Usi Zade said. When should investors favor Bitcoin over altcoins? Many market participants now advise newcomers to hold Bitcoin only, abandoning the common 70/30 Bitcoin/Ether allocation. Usi Zade said that advice reflects Bitcoin’s sustained outperformance and Ether’s relative stability. Bitcoin’s near-term momentum and market dominance leave limited incentive for retail investors to shift into Ether or smaller tokens without clear catalysts. What data supports this market stance? Market-share figures show Bitcoin with roughly 58% dominance and Ether around 12% after recent shifts (CoinMarketCap). These percentages indicate concentrated capital and reduce the odds of a broad altcoin rally absent new developments. Key Takeaways Altcoin season unlikely: Widespread altcoin gains are improbable without tangible technological breakthroughs. Bitcoin decoupling: BTC often rallies independently, limiting capital flow into altcoins. Action for investors: Focus on Bitcoin or narrative-led tokens; expect shorter, sector-specific cycles. Frequently Asked Questions Will altcoins ever rally together again? Broad altcoin rallies require sustained technological or adoption catalysts across many projects. Without that, rallies will be sector-focused and short-lived. Is Bitcoin dominance permanent? Bitcoin dominance can fluctuate. Currently high dominance reflects capital concentration and BTC’s independent momentum, but narrative shifts or major tech advances could change that over time. How should a new investor allocate funds today? Conservative advice is to prioritize Bitcoin exposure and selectively add narrative-driven altcoins with clear fundamentals and roadmaps. Risk management and long-term horizons remain crucial. Conclusion Altcoin season appears constrained by Bitcoin’s decoupling and a lack of broad technological drivers. Traders should expect more targeted, narrative-led rallies rather than a blanket altseason. Monitor sector narratives, prioritize liquidity, and consider Bitcoin-heavy allocations while projects demonstrate sustained fundamentals. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to adapt your crypto portfolio when altcoin season is unlikely"", ""description"": ""Practical steps to reposition a portfolio in a market where altcoins are unlikely to rally broadly."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess current allocations"", ""text"": ""Review holdings and identify low-liquidity or underdeveloped altcoins that may underperform without catalysts."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Increase Bitcoin weighting"", ""text"": ""Shift a portion of capital to Bitcoin to capture core market momentum and reduce exposure to high-volatility altcoins."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Select narrative-led opportunities"", ""text"": ""Allocate small, research-driven positions to sectors with clear catalysts, such as RWA or infrastructure projects with proven roadmaps."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Maintain risk controls"", ""text"": ""Use position sizing, stop-losses, and regular rebalancing to protect capital during shorter, more frequent market cycles."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will altcoins ever rally together again?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Broad altcoin rallies require sustained technological or adoption catalysts across many projects.

Key point 1 – Proposal to study a national Bitcoin reserve and funding via seized crypto Key point 2 – MPs request the government reaffirm the Riksbank Act to signal no CBDC intent Key point 3 – Sweden has 85 crypto firms (Tracxn), and new confiscation rules allow seizure of crypto (Bitbo reference) Sweden Bitcoin reserve: Swedish MPs urge a study into a national Bitcoin reserve to hedge inflation and diversify assets; funding options, CBDC stance and policy impact explained. The proposal has come from two Swedish Democrats, a party that is a key player in backing the Swedish ruling coalition and its minority government. Two members of Sweden’s parliament, the Riksdag, have proposed that the country investigate establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve to tackle inflation and diversify its holdings. They also want the government to promise it won’t change the legislation governing the monetary policy of Sweden’s central bank, to show it doesn’t intend to introduce a digital central bank currency. In their proposal to the Riksdag on Wednesday, Swedish Democrats Dennis Dioukarev and David Perez said that, given other countries like the US are already in the process of creating a reserve, Sweden should “participate in this digital arms race and join the growing group of nations that accepted and recognized the potential of Bitcoin.” Similar to the US, Dioukarev and Perez have floated the idea of funding the reserve through seized Bitcoin, but said the decision on which authority will manage the Bitcoin (BTC) is an “open question,” for now. Sweden doesn’t have any publicly listed Bitcoin holdings, according to Bitbo. However, in November 2024 the country introduced a law allowing authorities to confiscate luxury items, including crypto, even if they aren’t the target of an investigation. Source: Jan3 Advocates for Bitcoin strategic reserves argue nation-state treasuries holding Bitcoin could help diversify reserve composition and reduce correlation with fiat-driven monetary policy risks. What is the Sweden Bitcoin reserve proposal? Sweden Bitcoin reserve refers to a parliamentary proposal by MPs Dennis Dioukarev and David Perez to study creating a state-level Bitcoin reserve as a complement to traditional currency and gold reserves. The proposal emphasizes hedging inflation, diversifying assets, and signaling support for digital innovation. How would Sweden fund and manage a Bitcoin reserve? Dioukarev and Perez suggested using seized crypto as a potential funding source, though they left the managing authority unspecified. Sweden’s recent confiscation laws (November 2024) permit authorities to seize crypto and luxury goods, providing a legal avenue for funding without new taxation. Market context: Tracxn lists 85 Swedish crypto firms, 20 of which raised roughly $48 million in venture capital and private funding. Bitcoin’s fixed 21 million supply and relative asset size (ranked among the top global assets) are cited as practical reasons for its reserve role. Swedish Democrats Dennis Dioukarev and David Perez want the government to establish a Bitcoin reserve. Source: Riksdag Why do proponents say a Bitcoin reserve matters? Proponents argue a Bitcoin reserve could reduce exposure to political, geopolitical and monetary policy risks that affect traditional reserves. They say Bitcoin’s decentralised protocol and capped supply can act as an inflation hedge, while ownership signals a national openness to digital innovation. “In contrast, Bitcoin’s value is not driven by the monetary policies of individual states or any specific economy, which can reduce the overall correlation in the reserve,” the proposal states. Will a Bitcoin reserve mean Sweden abandons a CBDC? Dioukarev and Perez explicitly requested the government promise not to change the Riksbank Act’s definition of legal tender, framing the reserve proposal alongside a commitment against adopting a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The Riksbank’s prior CBDC pilot (final report March 2024) concluded the decision is ultimately political. Human Rights Foundation data (CBDC tracker) highlights efficiency and inclusion benefits of CBDCs but warns of privacy and state-control risks—arguments cited by the MPs in advocating a non-CBDC path. Among the top five crypto companies operating in Sweden are an exchange and a cold wallet developer. Source: Tracxn Frequently Asked Questions How likely is Sweden to create a Bitcoin reserve? Probability depends on political support and fiscal review; the Swedish Democrats influence the minority government, but any move requires cross-party consensus and a framework for custody, valuation and accounting of crypto assets (40–50 words). Can seized crypto legally fund a national reserve? Yes, under November 2024 confiscation rules Sweden can seize crypto. Using seized assets to fund a reserve would require legislative clarity on valuation, legal title transfer and custodial arrangements to meet international accounting standards. What impact would a reserve have on Sweden’s monetary policy? A Bitcoin reserve would be a balance-sheet diversification rather than a monetary policy tool; the Riksbank would retain control over monetary policy if the Riksbank Act remains unchanged, as the MPs request. Key Takeaways Policy proposal : Two Swedish Democrats propose studying a national Bitcoin reserve to hedge inflation and diversify reserves. Funding options : Seized crypto is suggested as a funding source under new confiscation rules (Nov 2024). CBDC clarity : MPs want a government promise not to change the Riksbank Act to signal no CBDC adoption. Conclusion The Sweden Bitcoin reserve proposal signals growing national-level interest in crypto as a strategic reserve asset. With legal avenues for seized crypto and a vocal political actor supporting the idea, Sweden’s discussion may shape broader European debates on reserve diversification and CBDC policy.

The slide coincided with U.S. shutdown jitters across risk assets, but crypto quickly mirrored equities’ intraday recovery.

SOL's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Solana ETF Speculation Keeps Bulls Optimistic Ahead of October 10 The next major milestone for Solana is set to arrive on October 10, when the SEC is expected to decide on several spot Solana ETF applications. While reports suggest that regulators have asked some asset managers to withdraw filings tied to certain altcoins, analysts argue this is more of a procedural move than a rejection. Many believe October, already being dubbed “Cointober”, could see multiple crypto ETFs advance, echoing the pattern that fueled Ethereum’s breakout earlier this year. This ongoing ETF narrative, combined with Solana’s swift recovery from volatility, has helped maintain strong bullish sentiment among traders and institutions alike. On-Chain Tug-of-War: Veterans Take Profit, Newcomers Hold the Line Under the surface, Solana’s holder base is divided. Liveliness has increased, suggesting long-term holders (LTHs) are gaining strength after a three-month upward trend. At the same time, 1–3 month holders now control about 14.4% of the supply, the highest in five months, indicating growing short-term conviction. That “old guard vs. fresh capital” conflict has effectively kept the price above the rising trendline, even as profit-taking episodes occur. Institutional flows remain the key factor. Talk among market participants about asset-manager positioning ahead of an ETF decision, combined with ongoing builder activity in Solana DeFi, supports steady medium-term demand. If Bitcoin dominance diminishes, high-beta L1s like SOL typically attract additional flows. Will Solana Break $214 Resistance and Target $232? Technically, SOL regained its weekly median range after the flash crash, indicating underlying strength. Immediate support is at $206; breaking below it could open the door to $200, weakening the three-month bullish trend. Related Reading: Did Bitcoin Top? Top Trader Warns Of Brutal $98,000 Liquidity Sweep On the upside, $214 and $221 are the near-term barriers; a close above both could lead to the $232 target flagged by multiple traders.

52547643,595066,1759377653,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52547643.jpeg,Dogecoin Mining Gets $2.5M Boost From Trump-Linked Thumzup Media,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-mining-gets-2-5m-boost-from-trump-linked-thumzup-media/,"According to multiple reports, Thumzup Media Corporation has provided a $2.5 million loan to DogeHash Technologies to help expand Dogecoin mining operations. The cash is tied to an agreement that could turn into an all-stock acquisition, with DogeHash shareholders reportedly set to receive about 30.7 million Thumzup shares under the deal. That swap, based on the filings and press notes , may lead the combined company to adopt a new ticker and brand if the transaction closes. Thumzup Expands Mining Fleet Reports have disclosed the fresh funds will go toward buying and deploying more mining rigs. The plan calls for adding 500+ ASIC miners, which backers say would push the company’s active machines to over 4,000 by year end. That is a substantial jump from current levels. The company has also been building a treasury of Dogecoin. Based on reports, Thumzup has accumulated roughly 7.5 million DOGE at an estimated cost near $2 million. Share Swap And Possible Rebrand Sources indicate the proposed purchase is an all-share transaction rather than a cash sale. The 30.7 million share figure would give DogeHash holders a stake in Thumzup , and some statements suggest management expects to seek a new ticker — mentioned in rumor as “XDOG” — after closing. Timelines cited in disclosures point to a closing window in Q4, but that timing depends on regulatory checks and shareholder approvals. The change in focus from marketing services to crypto and mining is being framed by backers as a strategic shift for Thumzup’s business model. Regulatory And Execution Risks There are risks. Reports warn that delivering hundreds of ASIC units, securing power, and managing higher operating costs are not simple tasks. Mining difficulty and hardware supply chain delays could blunt the expected gains. Loan terms and final deal mechanics remain subject to due diligence. Also, while the news has been tied to the Trump family, the link is mainly through prior share purchases by Donald Trump Jr., not direct corporate control. Market And Shareholder Reaction Stock and crypto watchers reacted quickly. Some traders bid the shares and Dogecoin higher on the news, while others eyed the deal skeptically. Analysts pointed out that buying more miners does not guarantee profit if Dogecoin’s network conditions change or energy costs spike. Shareholders will look closely at the details of the loan, any future dilution, and the timeline for full integration of DogeHash into Thumzup.

The latest ones will allow the community to build their own DEX and AMM interfaces. Still in Testing Phase Dr. Chengdiao Fan (one of Pi Network’s co-founders) announced during the crypto conference TOKEN2049 in Singapore that the project has deployed new decentralized exchange (DEX) and automated market maker (AMM) liquidity pool features to its blockchains. They will enable developers and Pioneers to experiment directly with token swaps, liquidity pools, and other tools. Fan revealed that the features have been rolled out only on Testnet, and after the testing period, they will be accessible on Mainnet: “Mainnet restricts this functionality for now, but the interface in the Pi Wallet will display these options and link users to the Testnet environment. These features are innate on the protocol level of the Pi blockchain and allow the community to build their own DEX and AMM interfaces.” In addition, Fan explained that these tools will also enable Pioneers to educate themselves about DeFi before directly participating on Mainnet and interacting with real PI tokens. Following the latest update, developers can test coins on the Pi Testnet blockchain. Documentation explaining the entire process will be released in the coming weeks. The creation of tokens is crucial for these features to function properly. Developers are allowed to produce coins on the Pi Testnet blockchain, while such functionality is similarly restricted on Mainnet during the testing period. The End of the Domains Auction In mid-June, Pi Network’s team unveiled the .pi Domains Auction: a bidding event that enables Pioneers to acquire unique names, replacing long addresses consisting of numerous letters and numbers. The initiative officially concluded on September 30, and no new bids will be accepted after that date. However, the team explained that if a domain receives a bid within the last 24 hours of the auction, the window will automatically extend for another 24 hours. “If another bid occurs in the extended window, it will extend for an additional 24 hours, and so on. This rolling extension mechanism is as defined in the original Auction rules, and it ensures fairness for all Pioneers actively participating. At the close of the specific domain auctions, winning Pioneers will secure their bids for the domains they pursued.” The conclusion of the auction will be followed by a data review phase that will last approximately two months. After that, eligible users can start claiming their domains.

Futures volume and a near 2% rise in open interest show trader buildup, keeping ETH range-bound between $3,400–$4,400 until bulls close decisively above the 9-day EMA. ETH failing to close above 9-day EMA near $4,150 signals limited upside and risk of re-test to $3,400–$3,600. Futures volume jumped ~39% to $198B with open interest +1.91%, indicating position accumulation ahead of a big move. Historical Q4 strength after mixed Q3s raises odds of year-end rallies; ETH is +64% over 90 days, +23% YTD. Ethereum resistance at $4,150 stalls upside — ETH price outlook, futures signals, and Q4 scenarios explained. Read updated analysis and key levels. (Updated Oct 2025) Ethereum struggles at $4,150 resistance as bulls fight to hold momentum amid growing selling pressure. ETH faces strong rejection near $4,400, with moving averages now acting as resistance. Open interest jumps 1.91% amid rising volume, signaling trader buildup near $4K. Historical Q4 rallies follow stabilizing Q3s, raising expectations for another bullish run. Ethereum is stuck just below $4,150 resistance after losing support earlier this month. With mixed futures activity and weak momentum, traders are watching closely—will ETH break higher or fall back toward stronger support near $3,400–$3,600? What is causing Ethereum resistance near $4,150? Ethereum resistance near $4,150 is driven by short-term moving averages (9-day EMA, 50-day SMA) sitting above price and a layered supply zone around $4,400 where late buyers are exiting. These technical barriers, combined with mixed futures positioning, keep upward momentum muted until a confirmed close above key EMAs. How does futures open interest and volume influence ETH price action? Open interest rose ~1.91% while futures volume spiked ~39% to roughly $198 billion in a day, indicating fresh positioning. High volume with rising open interest usually signals conviction; here it suggests traders are betting on a directional move but remain split, as longs and shorts are near parity. This creates potential volatility around key levels. Source: AlphaCryptoSignal Via X Why does the $4,400 area act as a supply zone? Price clustering between $4,150 and $4,400 has produced trapped buyers who sold into weakness, turning that range into a supply zone. Moving averages above price add resistance, and rotation of profit-taking around those levels increases selling pressure. Historical trade flow and order-book snapshots (exchange-level data) support this assessment. When could ETH regain bullish momentum into Q4? ETH is more likely to regain clear bullish momentum after a sustained close above the 9-day EMA and then the 50-day SMA with rising volume and falling volatility. Historically, Q4 rallies have followed stabilizing Q3 action; past cases (2017, 2020, 2021, 2023) show stronger year-end flows and retail re-engagement supporting upside. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Ethereum struggles at $4,150 resistance as futures heat up and traders position for Q4"", ""description"": ""Ethereum resistance at $4,150 limits gains as moving averages and a $4,400 supply zone create selling pressure.

If ETH cannot sustain above the 9-day EMA, immediate support lies between $3,400 and $3,600. These bands historically hosted accumulation and are reinforced by layered buy orders and previous swing lows. How should traders interpret the recent rise in open interest? Rising open interest (≈+1.91%) with a sharp volume spike suggests traders are building positions ahead of a decisive move. Interpretation depends on whether volume favors longs or shorts; current data shows a near balance, implying potential volatility rather than a clear breakout. Key Takeaways Resistance pressure : Short-term moving averages and a $4,400 supply zone cap upside around $4,150. Futures buildup : Volume up ~39% and open interest +1.91% signal trader positioning and possible increased volatility. Q4 watch : Historical Q4 strength suggests upside potential if ETH reclaims key EMAs; monitor on-chain flows and volume for confirmation. Conclusion Ethereum resistance near $4,150 is the immediate technical battleground. Ethereum resistance , moving averages, and a clustered supply zone around $4,400 are the defining factors for near-term direction. With futures activity rising and historical Q4 patterns favoring year-end rallies, market participants should watch EMA closes, volume, and open interest for confirmation.
