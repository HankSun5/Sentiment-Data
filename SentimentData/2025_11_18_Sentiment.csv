Szabo warned that while the layer one of a strong trust-minimized system can endure many kinds of interference, legal routes remain a meaningful vulnerability. He said financial rules are one set of risks the ecosystem has learned to handle, helped by developers and an expanding legal profession focused on crypto , but that laws tied to arbitrary data create a much wider and less predictable attack surface. Trust Minimized Not Trustless Szabo told readers that the technical design reduces the need to trust single parties, yet it does not eliminate the need for trust entirely. According to his view, losing the phrase “trustless” and using “trust-minimized” is important because it points to real limits. Developers must keep the protocol informed by careful choices. Anarcho-capitalism is a wonderfully abstract ideal that can inspire innovation. It helped inspire me to help invent cryptocurrency. But real-world cryptocurrencies are not trustless — they are trust-minimized. Each cryptocurrency has a legal attack surface, representing the… — Nick Szabo (@NickSzabo4) November 16, 2025 Lawyers have become part of the defense too, he said, and that legal work has made financial law attacks manageable in many cases. The claim is not that Bitcoin is fragile; it is that the threats are not only technical — they are real, legal, and those threats change with new laws and court decisions. Regulators Face Practical Limits Not everyone agrees. One critic, Chris Seedor, who runs a Bitcoin seed storage company called Seedor, pushed back and called some legal fears “boogeymen.” Based on reports of his remarks, Seedor argued that states can try to use law to stop tools and protocols, but history shows limits. Respectfully, I think you’re giving too much weight to speculative legal boogeymen. Bitcoin’s resilience was never about predicting every possible domain of law – it was about minimizing technical points where coercion can bite. If regulators could shut down general-purpose data… — Coinjoined Chris (@coinjoined) November 16, 2025 He pointed to PGP and Tor as two technologies that have been unpopular with some regulators yet remain available. His point: when code lacks central points of control, courts and agencies have less practical leverage to fully shut it down. Arguments From Different Angles The debate is partly about emphasis. Szabo focuses on open legal questions and new kinds of laws that could be used to target content or arbitrary data placed on-chain. Seedor highlights how technical design can remove the lever points that make enforcement easy. Both are talking about the same problem from different directions: one looks at the legal map and sees many untested routes; the other looks at past enforcement and sees that states rarely win against widely distributed protocols.

The broader market has also been unstable, adding pressure to Dogecoin. Despite this stretch of bearish price action, a deeper look at the higher-timeframe chart shows a structure that has not been invalidated by the recent decline. This is where a technical analysis from XForceGlobal comes in, as he argues that Dogecoin is sitting inside an “insanely bullish” long-term formation that is unfolding beneath the surface. The 5-Wave Structure Behind Dogecoin’s Bullish Setup A detailed technical analysis shared by XForceGlobal on the social media platform X argues that Dogecoin is nearing the final stages of an Elliott Wave formation. His interpretation points to cycle targets well above $1 and frames the ongoing price action as part of a developing fifth impulse wave. Related Reading: Top Meme Coins Besides Dogecoin And Shiba Inu With Potential Still Seeing Major Interest The chart shared by XForceGlobal outlines an idealized Elliott Wave cycle that stretches back almost a decade. Dogecoin has already completed the first four major waves on the macro level. The technical analysis shows the fifth wave technically began months ago, with the fourth wave bottom forming sometime between late 2023 and early 2024. However, the prolonged pullbacks of the past few months introduce the possibility that the fourth wave may still be playing out, instead of the fifth wave. Despite the choppy price action, the analysis shows that the fourth wave low is protected, and the current price action is still the fifth wave. The chart also shows how Dogecoin has been distributing within a narrowing structure, but the lows have consistently held. Both of the scenarios visualized on Dogecoin’s price chart still lead to a new all-time high once the rally resumes for another strong push. Why The Next Dogecoin Wave Points Toward $1 XForceGlobal noted that “cycle targets are still $1+,” a projection supported by the geometry of the fifth wave. The structure resembles the same formations that highlighted Dogecoin’s massive expansions in earlier bull cycles, particularly in 2017 and 2021. Nonetheless, it’s important to note that there’s still room for more distribution. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Price “Historic Mega Run” – Here’s The Target The current resistance zones sit far below his projected fifth-wave target zone, and the broader market structure shows no violation of the wave-4 levels that must hold for the setup to still be valid. The chart highlights a potential path that first moves through the $0.33-$0.47 zone before clearing the psychological $0.50 threshold and finally breaking above its current all-time highs at $0.731 and further up into the $1 region. A full extension of the fifth wave from present levels implies a price target around $1.768. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1618.

Now, as that capitulation hits the tape, long-term cycle signals and on-chain bands line up to test how deep this reset can go. Retail Bitcoin Holders Dump 148K BTC as Price Breaks Below Key Cost Bases Retail-linked Bitcoin holders dumped about 148,241 BTC at a loss on Nov. 14 as the price slid below $100,000 and under several realized price bands, according to on-chain data from CryptoQuant. Holders Net Daily Change. Source: CryptoQuant The metrics show that wallets often associated with newer or smaller investors, grouped as holders with less than 1 million BTC, turned sharply net negative on the day. The selling hit while Bitcoin traded near $96,853, well below the group’s estimated cost basis between roughly $102,000 and $107,000. The move marked one of the largest single-day net outflows for these addresses in recent months. At the same time, realized price curves for younger UTXO age bands flipped above spot. The realized prices for coins held between one day and one week, one week and one month, and up to one year now stand higher than the market price. That structure indicates that many recent buyers are underwater, a condition that often coincides with heavier pressure from short-term holders. Bitcoin Realized Price UTXO Age Bands. Source: CryptoQuant/X The break of the $100,000 level added a psychological layer to the on-chain stress. Once spot fell through both the round-number mark and the realized ranges of recent entrants, selling accelerated as investors moved to cut losses. The outflow reflects a wave of capitulation from buyers who entered near the peak and chose to exit rather than face a deeper drawdown. Despite the pain for those sellers, the same data set shows that other market participants absorbed the coins. The transfer from short-term, loss-making holders to counterparties still willing to buy below $100,000 highlights a shift in ownership as Bitcoin tests new support levels after the flush. Bitcoin Tests Cycle Markers as Price Falls Below Key Bands Bitcoin is moving through levels that previously marked the end of major market cycles, according to new chart data shared by Mister Crypto and Glassnode analyst Ali. As price trades under $98,650, both long-term technical patterns and MVRV deviation bands highlight support zones that historically defined cyclical bottoms. Mister Crypto’s visual comparison shows the same signal repeating at the close of the 2014, 2017, and 2021 cycles: a monthly death cross between the 20-month and 50-month moving averages. Each occurrence aligned with a prolonged downturn before markets reset. The 2025 chart now shows the same cross forming again as Bitcoin pulls back from its recent peak, placing the current correction in line with prior cycle-end structures. Bitcoin Cycle Death Cross. Source: Mister Crypto At the same time, on-chain data from Glassnode shows price slipping below the mean MVRV deviation band at $98,650. Once that band breaks, the next statistically defined levels sit at $75,740, $56,160, and $52,820. Those ranges mark deeper points where market value historically reconnected with realized fundamentals during extended corrections.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the decline with a 1.2% drop, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite followed with losses of 0.90% and 0.84% respectively. This broad-based decline affected multiple sectors and raised questions about market stability. Why Did US Stock Indices Experience This Decline? Several factors contributed to the downward pressure on US stock indices during this trading session. Market analysts point to concerns about inflation data, potential interest rate changes, and global economic uncertainties. Moreover, sector-specific weaknesses in technology and industrial stocks amplified the overall market decline. The simultaneous drop across all three major US stock indices suggests systemic rather than isolated issues. Breaking Down the Numbers: How Each Index Performed Let’s examine the specific performance of each major US stock index: Dow Jones Industrial Average : Fell 1.2%, representing the largest decline among the three indices S&P 500 Index : Dropped 0.90%, affecting a broad range of large-cap companies Nasdaq Composite : Declined 0.84%, showing technology stocks weren’t immune to the sell-off This coordinated movement across US stock indices indicates widespread investor caution rather than sector-specific concerns. What Does This Mean for Your Investment Strategy? When US stock indices move in unison like this, it’s crucial to reassess your investment approach. Consider these key points: Diversification becomes even more important during market volatility Long-term investors might see this as a potential buying opportunity Monitor economic indicators that could signal future market direction The performance of US stock indices often reflects broader economic trends that can impact various asset classes. Historical Context: How Often Do All Three Indices Decline Together? While simultaneous declines across all three major US stock indices occur periodically, they typically signal significant market events. Historical data shows that such coordinated movements often precede periods of increased volatility. However, they can also represent healthy market corrections after extended rallies. Understanding these patterns helps investors make informed decisions about their portfolios. Key Takeaways from Today’s Market Movement The decline in US stock indices serves as an important reminder about market dynamics. First, even established indices experience fluctuations. Second, diversified portfolios help mitigate risk during such periods. Finally, staying informed about market conditions enables better decision-making. The movement of US stock indices provides valuable insights into investor sentiment and economic health. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the decline in US stock indices? The decline resulted from multiple factors including inflation concerns, interest rate expectations, and global economic uncertainties affecting investor confidence across US stock indices. Should I be worried about my investments? Market fluctuations are normal. Consult with a financial advisor about your specific situation, but remember that diversified portfolios typically weather such movements in US stock indices. How often do all three major indices decline together? While not daily occurrences, simultaneous declines across major US stock indices happen several times per year and reflect broader market sentiment shifts. Will this affect cryptocurrency markets? Traditional market movements in US stock indices can influence cryptocurrency markets as investors often view different asset classes as correlated during risk-off periods. What sectors were most affected? The decline was broad-based, though technology and industrial sectors showed particular weakness across the major US stock indices. Is this a good time to buy stocks? Market declines can present opportunities, but timing the market is challenging. Consider your investment horizon and risk tolerance when US stock indices experience volatility.

The influential Fed official, often mentioned as a potential successor to Chair Jerome Powell, declared he would have ended the quantitative easing program much sooner. This revelation about Fed QE policy comes at a critical juncture for both traditional finance and digital assets. What Exactly Is Fed QE Policy and Why Does It Matter? Quantitative easing represents the Federal Reserve’s strategy of injecting massive liquidity into financial markets. The central bank purchases government bonds and other securities to stimulate economic activity. However, Governor Waller believes the Fed QE policy continued for too long, potentially fueling inflation and market distortions that affected everything from stocks to cryptocurrencies. The timing of these comments couldn’t be more significant. As the Fed navigates between controlling inflation and supporting economic growth, Waller’s perspective on Fed QE policy suggests a more hawkish approach might have been preferable. This stance directly impacts: Interest rate decisions Market liquidity conditions Cryptocurrency volatility patterns Investment strategy adjustments How Would Earlier Fed QE Policy Changes Have Affected Markets? Governor Waller’s position raises crucial questions about alternative economic scenarios. Had the Fed implemented his preferred Fed QE policy timeline, markets might have experienced: Reduced inflationary pressures could have emerged sooner, potentially moderating the aggressive interest rate hikes that rocked both traditional and crypto markets. The relationship between Fed QE policy and digital assets remains complex, but earlier tightening might have prevented some of the excess liquidity that flowed into speculative investments. What Does This Mean for Future Fed QE Policy Decisions? Waller’s comments provide valuable insight into future monetary policy directions. His perspective on Fed QE policy suggests that when the next economic downturn occurs, the Federal Reserve might be more cautious about deploying massive stimulus measures. This approach to Fed QE policy could mean: Shorter duration for future quantitative easing programs More rapid normalization of balance sheets Earlier interest rate adjustments during recovery periods Reduced market dependency on Fed support Why Should Crypto Investors Care About Fed QE Policy? The connection between Federal Reserve actions and cryptocurrency markets has strengthened significantly. Changes in Fed QE policy directly influence: Liquidity conditions across all financial markets, including digital assets. Investor risk appetite, which often drives capital flows into cryptocurrencies. Dollar strength, which inversely correlates with Bitcoin and other major crypto assets. Understanding these relationships helps crypto investors anticipate market movements and adjust their strategies accordingly. Key Takeaways from Waller’s Fed QE Policy Stance Governor Waller’s revelation provides crucial insights for market participants. His position on Fed QE policy indicates that internal Fed debates about stimulus duration were more intense than publicly known. The implications extend beyond traditional finance to affect digital asset valuations and market psychology. Moving forward, investors should monitor Fed communications for signals about how this perspective might influence future policy decisions. The evolution of Fed QE policy thinking could determine how the central bank responds to future economic challenges. Frequently Asked Questions What is quantitative easing? Quantitative easing is a monetary policy where central banks purchase government securities to inject money into the economy and stimulate growth. Why does Fed QE policy affect cryptocurrencies? QE increases market liquidity, which often flows into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, potentially driving prices higher. How long did the recent QE program last? The Fed’s pandemic-era QE program lasted approximately two years before beginning tapering in late 2021. What are the risks of extended QE programs? Prolonged QE can fuel inflation, create asset bubbles, and make markets dependent on central bank support. Could Waller become the next Fed Chair? While mentioned as a potential candidate, the decision depends on presidential appointment and Senate confirmation. How can investors prepare for QE policy changes? Monitor Fed communications, diversify portfolios, and understand how liquidity changes affect different asset classes. Found this analysis of Fed QE policy insights helpful?

The team made the announcement in a statement where they reflected on a mix of pride in what they were able to achieve as a platform and exhaustion from market pressures. The closure heralds the loss of a well-known provider of data, rankings, and insights for dapps across multiple blockchain networks. Why DappRadar is packing up According to what the founders shared on X on Monday, the shutdown is happening because running the platform as it is has become “financially unsustainable in the current environment,” and its tracking services, which covered blockchains and Dapps, will be taken offline in the coming days, as the shutdown begins. “After seven years, it’s time to say goodbye. We’ve made the difficult decision to shut down the DappRadar platform. Running a platform of this scale became financially unsustainable in the current environment, and after exploring every option, we had to make the difficult decision to wind things down,” the team wrote on X. According to the post, which has been viewed over 300,000 times, the platform plans to inform its users separately on what will happen to its native RADAR token and its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). It also revealed that there are decisions to be made regarding the token and the DAO and that it was interested in hearing from the community. Following the announcement, the token price took a nosedive of about 40% immediately, reaching as low as $0.00064, according to data from Nansen. DappRadar’s RADAR token is down more than 35% since the shutdown announcement. Source: CoinMarketCap For now, it is unclear what will come next for the team at DappRadar. However, in their announcement, they expressed hope that the mission to help people understand and better explore decentralized apps will not end with the shutdown and that someone will pick up where they’ve left off and “carry the torch forward.” The team believes DeFi is a core pillar of finance, and even though funding has been cooling and exploit-related losses have surged this year, there is space for more growth and recovery. DappRadar is not the only DeFi protocol to shut down recently The shutdown of DappRadar is a big blow to the DeFi space; the platform had aggregated crucial metrics that helped users avoid rugs and stay ahead of the bots as they analyzed Web3 projects. Still, its shutdown is not an isolated case in the DeFi sector and comes on the heels of a broader wave of Web3 shutdowns this year, which has affected exchanges like eXch, NFT marketplaces like X2Y2, and DeFi protocols like Mango Markets. eXch was privacy-focused and famous for encouraging anonymous trading, but it announced permanent closure in May of 2025 amid intense regulatory scrutiny. The platform first opened shop in 2021 and handled millions in volume before it came under fire for helping hackers launder billions in the February hack that targeted Bybit, an ordeal it could not recover from. As far as NFT marketplaces go, X2Y2 was one of the most popular; founded in 2022 pseudonomously, it stood out with its low fees and royalty enforcement tools and was even touted as a threat to Opensea at some point, with its $5.6B in all-time volume. Unfortunately, that was when the NFT sector was on the up and up. It has been in a bear market for a long time now, and X2Y2 has not fared well. Mango Markets used to be a hot venue for DeFi lending and perps trading on Solana, but it fully shut down in January of this year, following a unanimous governance approval that felt inevitable after the exploit that rocked the protocol in October 2022. These are only some of the notable platforms in crypto that have shut down this year; there are many more, and a lot come from the gaming sector, which is currently suffering as VC funds are busy chasing shiny new things like the AI sector.

Tom Lee stated that Ethereum is in a “supercycle” and that he maintains his bullish outlook in the long term despite technical corrections. According to Lee, the biggest driver keeping Ethereum's core story intact is the projects built on its blockchain, particularly the massive developments in asset tokenization. Financial institutions, including Wall Street's leading figure, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, are exploring bringing traditional assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate to the blockchain. He noted that this process will require a neutral blockchain with 100% uptime, and that Ethereum is the most suitable candidate for this role. The analyst argues that despite the cryptocurrency's high volatility, the fundamental narrative is solid and that institutional interest will support Ethereum. Related News: Watch Out: Significant Selling Preparation May Be Underway in This Altcoin, On-Chain Data Reveals - It's Largest Institutional Holder While assessing the likelihood of Ethereum's price bottoming this week, the analyst highlighted the ratio of the value of all assets locked on its blockchain to its market capitalization. He noted that historically, Ethereum has bottomed at levels around 50%, and that the current situation is quite close to that level, increasing the likelihood of a bottom. He also argued that Ethereum is undervalued relative to Bitcoin (ETH/BTC). He added that he calculated that if Ethereum's price-to-BTC ratio were to reach its long-term (8-year) average, the ETH price could reach around $12,000, suggesting that Ethereum is currently undervalued. *This is not investment advice.

Inside the Presale Investors Think Could Deliver 20–50x Returns,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/11/dogecoin-price-prediction-doge-at-016-or-ev2-at-0015-inside-the-presale-investors-think-could-deliver-20-50x-returns,"Choosing between DOGE and EV2 feels like one of those decisions that can tie your brain in knots, especially now that the EV2 presale is heating up and drawing in buyers who believe it could turn pennies into fortunes with 20x to 50x returns if the stars align. Prices keep dancing to their own tune, sentiment keeps changing, and investors keep grabbing at anything that looks like a golden ticket DOGE still commands attention because of its loyal crowd, but interest drifts the moment a newer project whispers a stronger narrative. Currently, One EV2 token is priced at $0.01, with the next presale stage set at $0.025. On top of all that, the project rolled out a five hundred thousand dollar reward pool which gives early buyers even more to chew on. DOGE Market Outlook: Strong Volume With Strings Attached Dogecoin sits at $0.16 and the numbers paint a lively picture. Trading volume keeps roaring past $2 billion and the market cap sits comfortably above $24 billion. Liquidity is never a problem with DOGE and that alone keeps people circling around it. Still, the cracks show when you look closer. DOGE’s supply keeps growing without any ceiling in sight, which makes long term value feel like a slippery fish. Most of its big moves come when social media gets loud or when the market mood swings upward. That kind of rhythm means many buyers are riding the wave instead of following solid updates. It is true that DOGE still has charm and cultural weight, but the ecosystem itself has not changed in any meaningful way. When the hype cools, the price often follows suit. So DOGE ends up being one of those assets where you either catch the wind or get pushed back by it. EV2 Presale Momentum Shows A Project With A Clearer Path EV2 Presale is taking things into hands by being affordable and accessible. Right now, More than 43 million tokens have already left and the total raise has crossed $430,000. The game positions itself as a fast moving looter shooter that mixes open world action with competitive clashes. EV2 leans into its simple PvX structure and lets players jump into PvE or PvP without feeling lost. Tokens and Holocrons work together in a way that feels straightforward, yet still rewarding for players who want their progress to mean something. Additionally, players in EV2 manage a 200-slot inventory that can be expanded using EV2 Tokens. Rare items and weapons may become NFTs, potentially tradable on Web3 marketplaces. The game also features a fully modular weapon system with deep crafting synergies Survivor Mode: A Fight Where Every Second Counts Survivor mode is where players enter a brutal last man standing scenario where hesitation can cost you everything. This mode turns up the pressure because the safe zone keeps shrinking and every corner becomes a roll of the dice. It hits that sweet spot where anyone can shine if they think fast enough The Pathfinder suit fits perfectly because its speed helps players slip out of danger and strike when rivals least expect it. Fracture Survival Match: Collect Fast Or Lose Even Faster Fracture drops a number of twenty five players into a frantic scramble for glowing cubes that decide everything. It fits the EV2 reward cycle since strong performances bring better loot and better momentum. The Brute suit invites a more forceful style where you take cubes by overpowering anyone in your path. Collecting two cubes of each color reveals a relic which instantly turns the entire match into a hunt with one target. DOGE or EV2: Following the Crowd or Betting on the Game-Changer? If the choice is DOGE at $0.16 or EV2 at $ 0.015, the real question becomes whether you want a coin that moves with the crowd or a token tied to an actual game with active development. It is clear that they appeal to different kinds of investors, but EV2 does bring a newer structure, clearer gameplay identity, and a presale where buyers genuinely believe a 20 to 50X outcome is not out of the question if the project sticks to its roadmap. EV2 steps forward with a cleaner story and an active presale that actually feels like it has both feet on the ground.

Analyst claims Tron’s stability, strong wallet activity and steady USDT flow continue to support a bullish outlook. The EV2 token presale is gaining traction fast and is drawing fresh interest from investors. While most altcoins spent last week absorbing heavy losses, Tron (TRX) remained in a tight range between $0.28 and $0.31, experiencing only a 1% drop. This stability has given traders strong optimism for the altcoin as we enter a new week. Tron's price action has further printed a clean inverse head and shoulders, pushing above a descending trendline that held for weeks. This backs the optimism for a stronger price reversal. But where will Tron end the year? Technical Breakout Structure Points to a Bullish Direction As of this writing, TRX is trading at $0.2940 per the 4-hour chart . This price action puts Tron’s price above a trendline that has capped every rally since late October. The price has also printed a clean inverse head and shoulders pattern. The left shoulder, the deeper head, and the right shoulder align without distortion, a pattern rare to find, especially in a choppy market. Breaking above the inverse head and shoulder pattern , puts the resistance zone directly in play. Since this setup is highly considered bullish, traders are waiting to see volume spike to get back in the move. A strong close above the resistance zone at $.03100, would spark fresh confidence supporting a stronger recovery. However, the long-term descending line still sits at $0.33 and could act as the next resistance. But nonetheless, short-term control has shifted to buyers. TRX forms a clean bullish Inverse Head and Shoulder Pattern with breakout already taking place | Source: TradingView Multichain Growth Reinforces the Case for Higher Targets TRON also exhibits strong fundamentals, giving the bullish technical outlook a firm base. For instance, Stablecoin activity remains dominant while the chain processes a significant volume of USDT stablecoin, rivaling other networks. Data by DefiLlama for instance shows the network recorded 1.72% stablecoin market cap change, reaching $79.336b. USDT dominates with 98.54% market share. The Avail Nexus upgrade is also changing the platform’s reach. TRON now functions as a liquidity passageway between multiple chains. Apps that once stayed within TRON’s walls can now scale outward with fewer barriers. Based on these metrics, TRX could rise to $0.80130 by 2026. Strong institutional flows, well-established stablecoin rails, and a multichain environment attracting both developers and users could serve as the potential drivers for such a rally. However, the short-term target sits at $0.31 with the next possible level at $0.33. EV2 Presale Draws Heavy Early Attention Investors seeking early-stage upside are also moving toward presales with stronger narratives. Amongst these presales, EV2 has become one of the names circulating heavily in these discussions. The EV2 token presale has already cleared 46.18 million tokens, raising more than $431,3800 out of the possible $500,000. EV2 presale price sits at $0.01, attracting both gamers and crypto investors. Early adopters can use ETH, BTC, SOL, BNB, select stablecoins as well as credit card to purchase the token. Why is the EV2 token presale gaining traction so fast? EV2 token is set to serve as the primary token for the Earth Version 2 in-game economy. This game is a Web3-based MMO looter-shooter game offering an immersive experience to players while allowing them to earn rewards in form of EV2 token. Players can use this token to upgrade suits and gain access to exclusive battles. The game features several modes. For instance, its “Fracture Mode” pushes players into a survival setting where they collect luminous cubes, chase artifacts, and compete for token-based rewards. The system ties every action into the EV2 token economy, supported by NFTs that unlock in-game advantages. It avoids the repetitive cycle that tanked earlier play-to-earn experiments. Analyst Notes TRX’s Stability During Recent Market Slump Analysts monitoring the recent market drop recorded a clear divide between TRX and the major altcoins. Meghan Crypto, for instance, highlighted that TRX absorbed the recent market drop that saw BTC drop below $94,000 better than other top-cap altcoins. https://x.com/Meghan_Crypt/status/1990370968921940164 Instead, Tron maintained a narrow band and remained calm despite forced liquidations. On-chain data has further backed Tron's stability, as per Meghan. TRON’s daily active wallets recently surpassed 11 million and stay at a high level. USDT flows still dominate the chain, with roughly $80 billion moving through the network daily during peak volume. On the other hand, JustLend, the network’s lending protocol, holds a total value of billions and continues to deliver stable yields between 8% and 12%. This, combined with the network performance, strengthens Tron’s breakout argument on the chart. Price Outlook: Can TRX Secure $0.33? At the moment, TRX has proved to be resilient even under broader market pressure, recorded significant user engagement, and received a new burst of attention as EV2 presale continues to attract more investors to the ecosystem. If the market’s sentiment stabilizes and TRON continues to benefit from high-volume stablecoin flows, $0.33 could become a realistic checkpoint rather than distant speculation.

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) has begun to rise, speculative sentiment and token burns are still the driving forces behind its price growth. On the other hand, the DeFi ecosystem is shifting toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as it builds structured financial products with predictable growth and reliable returns. The speculative money in crypto is shifting toward engineered value products. While aiming to get in on the best crypto to buy, the shift from meme coins to profit-generating protocols is the crypto trend of 2025. The Limitations of Meme Coin Economics Shiba Inu (SHIB) has shown strength by getting stable at around $0.00000980. It has support due to the growth of the Shibarium network and the Shiba Inu token burning. However, broader market sentiment and the speculation within the Shiba Inu community still predominantly guide this token. Even though the token burning process adds some scarcity, the primary economic model still does not directly earn any revenue nor yield for the holders. This leads to reliance on speculative value, which is why savvy traders have started rotating capital into other productive assets like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Momentum As one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the definite alternative for investors. Innovations and profit go hand in hand for this investment. Capital for the presale in progress has been raised phenomenally, gaining over $18.75 million and over 18,050 holders to the community. The project is in its most important 6th Phase, with tokens available for a very affordable price of $0.035. This opportunity is closing very quickly, with over 90% of the tokens sold. Once Phase 7 is active, the price will rise nearly 20% to $0.040. This is one of the most advantageous and possibly last moments to invest at this price before the tokens go to the exchange. Dual Lending Mutuum Finance is a decentralized and non-custodial lending marketplace that facilitates lending and borrowing of cryptocurrencies through a secure smart contract platform. Traditional lending protocols operate through pooled resources alone, but Mutuum Finance implements a dual lending model that comprises Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. With the P2C model, the user deposits funds into a community pool that is managed through the use of smart contracts. The user earns mtTokens that show the ownership and the interest that the owner earns over time. The borrower gets the funds through overcollateralization terms that ensure the funds of the lenders are not put at risk. The model works similarly to other DeFi protocols such as Aave and Compound. Mutuum’s P2P lending system provides a custom loan agreement to lenders and borrowers. The custom loan terms include the interest rate and the collateral for the tokens that are considered volatile and cannot be lent through pooled lending. This feature of Mutuum is most beneficial to meme coins holders and other high-risk assets. Roadmap and Launch Mutuum Finance has a phased developmental schedule to ensure a safe and scalable launch of the dual lending protocol. V1 protocol debut is set to take place this quarter on the Sepolia testnet. The first version of the protocol will include lending and borrowing functionalities for ETH and USDT. After the testnet, Mutuum Finance intends to launch the mainnet with more functionalities such as enhanced P2P functions for volatile and meme tokens, a robust system of staking the mtToken, and the buy-and-distribute tokenomics model functioning completely. This will ensure that any bugs and vulnerabilities are removed before the protocol becomes completely functional. The Strategic Shift is Already Underway As we approach 2026, meme coin holders are shifting to DeFi instead of just waiting idly. Most will zealously partake in the ecosystem that is Mutuum Finance. The ongoing presale offers cutting-edge daily self-earn programs, built with user safety in mind. Since we are in the last stages of phase 6, it will only take a few days for the allocated presale to sell through. Join while there’s still time.

Recent data reveals a concerning trend that’s affecting nearly half of the XRP investment community. According to Glassnode’s latest analysis, the landscape for XRP holders has shifted dramatically, with profitability rates hitting their lowest point in months. Why Are XRP Holders Experiencing These Losses? The current situation shows that only 58.5% of XRP holders remain in profit, while a staggering 41.5% now find themselves in loss positions. This marks the most challenging period for XRP holders since November 2024, when the cryptocurrency traded at just $0.53. Despite XRP’s current price of $2.15, the underlying market structure appears unstable. Glassnode’s analysis indicates that many XRP holders purchased their positions at higher price points. This creates a scenario where: Recent buyers face immediate paper losses Long-term holders see their profits evaporate The overall market sentiment becomes cautious What Does This Mean for Current XRP Holders? If you’re among the XRP holders currently experiencing losses, understanding the market dynamics becomes crucial. The data suggests that the current price level isn’t sustainable for many investors who entered at peak prices. This creates pressure that could influence future price movements. For XRP holders considering their next move, several factors deserve attention: Market timing – When did you purchase your XRP? Investment strategy – Are you trading or holding long-term? Risk tolerance – How much volatility can you withstand? How Can XRP Holders Navigate This Volatile Period? Successful XRP holders often employ strategic approaches during market downturns. While every investor’s situation differs, some proven methods include: Dollar-cost averaging can help XRP holders reduce their average entry price. This strategy involves purchasing smaller amounts at regular intervals rather than timing the market. Many experienced XRP holders use this approach to manage risk during uncertain periods. Another consideration for XRP holders is portfolio diversification. While XRP may represent a significant portion of your crypto holdings, spreading investments across different assets can provide stability during market fluctuations. What’s the Future Outlook for XRP Holders? The current data doesn’t necessarily predict long-term outcomes for XRP holders. Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility, and positions can change rapidly. However, the current statistics serve as an important reminder about market cycles and investment timing. XRP holders should monitor key indicators such as: Trading volume patterns Market sentiment shifts Regulatory developments Adoption news and partnerships Final Thoughts for Concerned XRP Holders The reality that over 41% of XRP holders face losses underscores the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency investments. However, historical patterns show that market conditions can change quickly. The most successful XRP holders typically maintain perspective during challenging periods and make decisions based on research rather than emotion. Remember that being among XRP holders experiencing temporary losses doesn’t define your long-term investment success. Market corrections often create opportunities for strategic investors who understand the fundamental value of their assets. Frequently Asked Questions What percentage of XRP holders are currently profitable? Currently, 58.5% of XRP holders remain in profit, while 41.5% are experiencing losses according to Glassnode data. When was the last time XRP holder profitability was this low? The current profitability level for XRP holders is the lowest since November 2024, when XRP traded at $0.53. Should XRP holders sell during this downturn? This depends on individual investment goals and risk tolerance. Many experienced XRP holders consider market downturns as potential buying opportunities rather than selling triggers. What factors affect XRP holder profitability? XRP holder profitability is influenced by purchase price, market timing, overall cryptocurrency market trends, and specific XRP-related developments. How can XRP holders improve their position? XRP holders can consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging, portfolio rebalancing, and staying informed about market developments to manage their positions effectively. Is this normal for XRP holders to experience such volatility? Yes, cryptocurrency investments including XRP are known for their volatility. Periods of profit and loss are common in crypto markets.

The S-1/A filing dated November 17 introduces several administrative adjustments that include a ticker change to 21SH, updated share registration language, and a revised IRS employer identification number. The updated document keeps the broader framework of the ETF unchanged while signaling ongoing progress toward regulatory clearance. This development arrives during a week when Solana trades near its lowest levels in months, creating a notable intersection between regulatory movement and market pressure. Filing Adjustments and Regulatory Structure The updated filing confirms the ETF’s plan to track the CME CF Solana-Dollar Reference Rate. It also confirms that the fund will avoid leverage and derivatives. Additionally, the document outlines a staking component that the sponsor may activate if regulatory conditions remain favorable. The filing also explains the creation and redemption process, which continues to use 10,000-share baskets. Moreover, the document identifies Coinbase Custody, Anchorage Digital, and BitGo as the custodians responsible for holding the ETF’s SOL. The sponsor kept the broader structure unchanged. Hence, the new amendment highlights incremental progress rather than major strategic shifts. The filing lists Cboe BZX as the expected exchange and retains earlier language about continuous issuance. Besides the technical mechanics, analysts note that the amendment signals continued engagement with regulators during a challenging market period for Solana. Solana Price Holds a Key Band Despite Heavy Selling Solana trades near $130 after a sharp weekly decline that erased more than 22%.

Ethereum Treasury Firms Are Looking Unhealthy In a new thread on X, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has discussed some metrics related to Ethereum treasury companies . A treasury firm refers to a public corporation that has adopted a digital asset like Bitcoin or Ethereum as its reserve strategy. The idea was popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which pivoted to being a BTC treasury firm back in 2020. Since then, the company has grown into by far the largest corporate digital asset holder, with a whopping $47.54 billion invested. Earlier, companies were looking at only the number one cryptocurrency as a viable reserve asset, but this year, there has been a rise in holders of ETH, the coin ranked just behind BTC. The Ethereum treasury frenzy peaked in August, but since then, the growth rate attached to them has witnessed a slowdown, as the chart below shared by Edwards shows. From the graph, it’s clear that the rate of change for Ethereum treasuries is positive even after the slowdown, suggesting that companies remain in net accumulation. This has meant that, despite the outflows that the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have witnessed recently, institutional buying still remains above the cryptocurrency’s supply growth, although only just. While corporate accumulation continues, the ETH treasury business model may not be working for a lot of the firms. As the analyst has pointed out, the majority of companies have an mNAV value less than 1. mNAV, standing for Multiple of Net Asset Value, is a metric that compares the market cap of a treasury firm against the total value of its reserve assets. The indicator being below the 1 mark naturally implies the firm’s valuation is less than its treasury’s worth. About 64.3% of all Ethereum treasury firms currently fall into this zone. “That means the treasury company picture is a lot more unhealthy for ETH than Bitcoin,” explained Edwards. Clearly, ETH treasuries are coming under pressure, so are any of them reacting by selling? Data suggests not many, as the net buy/sell ratio related to them still remains strong. That said, while almost all Ethereum corporate holders are still net buyers, the buy/sell ratio has started to show a decline as the asset’s price has experienced its recent bearish shift. ETH Price Ethereum plunged toward $3,000 on Sunday, but the coin has since seen a small jump back to $3,200.",Ethereum|ETH|Ethereum treasury|Ethereum Treasury Company|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-17 22:00:33

According to the analysis, the daily chart has hit a historically oversold MACD reading not seen in years, aligning with a deeply oversold RSI. This confluence of extreme momentum signals suggests that the price has entered a major demand zone, dramatically increasing the likelihood of a powerful relief rally and setting the stage for a significant short-term rebound. MACD Hits Rare Historical Lows — A Zone Linked To Major ETH Bottoms According to a recent post from More Crypto Online, Ethereum is currently flashing one of its most extreme MACD readings seen in years on the daily timeframe. While the MACD technically has no fixed oversold threshold, comparing past cycles gives valuable context. Historically, ETH has often formed significant market bottoms whenever the MACD enters the -210 to -220 region, a zone it has dipped below a few times, but not often. Related Reading: Ethereum Slips to $3K, Highlighting Weakness After Recent Failed Rebound This puts the current MACD position into what can be considered a historically oversold zone, signaling increased potential for a relief bounce. Adding to this confluence, the RSI has also slipped deep into oversold territory, reinforcing the idea that sell pressure may be nearing exhaustion. Together, both indicators suggest that momentum could soon shift away from the bears. However, the analyst cautions that these signals alone do not confirm a major trend reversal. Oversold conditions can persist longer than expected, particularly in strong downtrends. Even so, such extreme readings are often early clues that a temporary recovery or a corrective move to the upside may be approaching. Overall, the current market structure gives the bears something to think about. Early Signs Of Relief: Ethereum Finds Stability In Key Demand Zone In a 3D market update, CryptoPulse reported that Ethereum has now cleanly tapped the identified Demand Zone, showing early signs that the aggressive downside may be easing. This reaction suggests sellers are losing momentum, creating the conditions for a potential short-term rebound if buyers step back in. Should bullish strength return, a retest of the $3,500 region is likely in the coming sessions. Related Reading: Ethereum Approaches Critical Resistance — Bullish Breakout Or Trap In The Making? However, CryptoPulse emphasized that confirmation is still required before calling any meaningful reversal. A strong bounce paired with a reclaim of key short-term levels would be the first signal that buyers are regaining control. Meanwhile, if bearish pressure persists, Ethereum may drift deeper into the chart structure, where the next significant demand sits between $2,400 and $2,600. This zone could act as the major support zone for ETH if the current support fails to hold.

Bloomberg Analyst McGlone Evaluates,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/why-did-bitcoin-fall-can-we-say-weve-entered-a-bear-market-bloomberg-analyst-mcglone-evaluates/,"Markets are reeling as Bitcoin plummets into bear market territory, erasing all of its gains from 2025. This sharp decline led to liquidations of over $1.1 billion, with an additional $2 billion outflow from digital asset products. Cryptocurrency markets are facing a massive sell-off, led by Bitcoin. The largest has officially entered a bear market, reversing all gains made through 2025. This decline has triggered a massive liquidation storm that has claimed over $1.1 billion in the markets. The sudden market crash was discussed in a discussion among macro strategists broadcast on the “The Wolf of All Streets” YouTube channel. Analysts warned that the current extreme volatility and cascading liquidations are reminiscent of past major market crashes. Bloomberg Senior Commodity Strategist Mike McGlone expressed concern about whether a modern-day “Black Monday” could be imminent for cryptocurrencies and potentially even stock markets. Related News: Bitcoin Drops Below $92,000, Ethereum Falls Below $3,000 - Here's the Latest Situation on the Dark Night According to expert analysis, there are several critical factors behind this negative market sentiment: Weakening Support Flows: Decreased fresh money entering the market. Rising Macro Tension: External factors such as global economic uncertainties and central bank policies are increasing pressure. Panic in Derivatives Markets: The prevalence of fear in futures and options markets and its reflection on spot markets. Insider Selling in Technology Stocks: In addition to macroeconomic concerns, experts also noted heavy insider selling in technology stocks. McGlone believes this isn't a “false correction,” but rather the start of an accelerating bear market and a period of “dominoes” falling. He believes Bitcoin will continue to lead the decline until the macroeconomic outlook improves. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Why Did Bitcoin Fall?

The trade left the wallet with just 847,000 USDA, an estimated 87% loss, and reopened tough questions about Cardano’s DeFi readiness. The Costly Transaction According to on-chain investigator ZachXBT, the whale wallet had been dormant for roughly five years before executing the swap, which temporarily pushed the USDA price far above its peg due to thin liquidity. Lookonchain reported the transaction at 14.45 million ADA, with a valuation just north of $7 million, resulting in the user receiving 847,694 USDA and incurring a loss of approximately $6.2 million. Screenshots shared by community member $DeFiPunk show the DEX interface flashing a “high price impact” warning and estimated slippage of over 87%, with the user manually ticking the “I understand this warning” checkbox before confirming the transaction. That has sparked debate over whether this was a reckless move, an honest mistake from an “inexperienced voucher holder,” as Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson suggested, or even a deliberate attention play to highlight liquidity issues. Reactions from the Cardano community were mixed. Some, like Cardano YOD₳, argued that “one bad swap can have negative reputational consequences” and questioned whether the ecosystem has its priorities right, pointing to marketing and governance debates instead of basic liquidity. Others countered that the issue was primarily “a liquidity first problem, and a DEX problem second,” criticizing the slow delivery of UX upgrades and the need for better batching solutions. Hoskinson, responding on X, called it a “teachable moment” for scaling Cardano’s DeFi in 2026, while firmly rejecting calls to compensate the whale. Market Pressure and Ecosystem Demands The multimillion-dollar blunder marks a continuation of a period of pressure for Cardano, with on-chain data from earlier in the month showing whales offloading 4 million ADA in a week as prices dropped from above $0.60 to roughly $0.53, further deepening bearish sentiment. Just days later, on November 11, there was renewed accumulation, with other large holders scooping up nearly 1% of the supply during a dip below $0.50, leading analysts to predict a possible rebound if ADA could reclaim the $0.70 area. This has not yet occurred, with the asset, which is ranked the eleventh-largest in terms of market cap, trading around $0.50, down approximately 17% in the last week and 22% over the past 30 days, according to CoinGecko data. Meanwhile, the episode has intensified calls for greater stablecoin liquidity on Cardano. Commentator Lorenzo argued plainly, “We need to 10x the stablecoin liquidity withdrawal right now.” This sentiment was echoed by others who believe the incident proves there is a substantial demand for moving capital on the network, but a lack of infrastructure to support it. However, Hoskinson repeatedly asserted , “It is not my job to bring a stablecoin to Cardano,” placing the responsibility on the broader ecosystem.

Down 75% year-to-date and shedding 19% in just the past week, PEPE is losing steam fast while rivals like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu hold stronger positions. With the Fed casting doubt on a December rate cut, risk appetite is fading across the board — and PEPE might be the first to break under pressure. Data from the CME Group’s FedWatch survey reflected how analysts’ revisited their projections for the next FOMC meeting. The odds that they would implement a rate cut in December dropped dramatically, from 91% back then to 45% at the time of writing. This significant shift in the market’s baseline scenario catalyzed the downward move we have seen in the past few days. Meme coins, including Pepe, have plunged as a result. Pepe Price Prediction: PEPE Drops Below Key Support and Could Lose Another 30% The latest selling pressure has pushed Pepe below a key support area at $0.0000055. As a result, it has formed a bearish descending price channel. Pepe could bounce off the lower bound of this setup in the next few days. However, it still needs to recapture the purple area highlighted in the chart if bulls want to prevent another crash. The next target for the token would be the 0.0000035 area, meaning a 29.8% downside risk. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains heavily depressed at 32, meaning that it is near oversold territory. This increases the odds of a rebound. However, since bearish momentum is so strong, a decisive break above $0.0000050 would be required to confirm a bullish outlook. Although Pepe’s upside potential seems limited at the time, a project called Pepenode ($PEPENODE) is attracting millions from investors. Its successful crypto presale could transform how users mine meme coins forever. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Makes Meme Coin Mining Hardware-Free Mining used to mean expensive gear, but Pepenode ($PEPENODE) changes everything with virtual rigs you can launch instantly and no hardware required .

This groundbreaking move brings sophisticated blockchain infrastructure to mainstream investors through a familiar investment vehicle. What Makes the Canton Network ETF So Revolutionary? The Canton Network ETF represents more than just another cryptocurrency fund. It specifically targets the Canton Network, a privacy-preserving Layer 1 blockchain designed for institutional use. Unlike traditional blockchain networks, Canton prioritizes confidentiality while maintaining interoperability between financial applications. This unique approach addresses one of the biggest concerns in institutional adoption: data privacy. James Seyffart, Bloomberg’s renowned ETF analyst, broke the news on social media platform X, highlighting the significance of this filing. The Canton Network ETF could potentially open doors for investors who want exposure to advanced blockchain infrastructure without directly managing complex cryptocurrency assets. Why Should Investors Care About This Development? The timing of this Canton Network ETF filing couldn’t be more strategic. As regulatory clarity improves and institutional interest in blockchain technology grows, this fund positions itself at the intersection of several key trends: Privacy-focused technology gaining importance in digital assets Institutional adoption of blockchain infrastructure Regulatory-compliant investment vehicles for crypto exposure Interoperability solutions becoming crucial for blockchain scalability Moreover, the Canton Network ETF offers a structured way to invest in blockchain’s underlying technology rather than just cryptocurrency prices. This distinction matters because it represents a shift from speculative trading to infrastructure investment. How Does the Canton Network Differ From Other Blockchains? The Canton Network stands out in the crowded blockchain space through its unique architecture. Designed specifically for financial applications, it enables: Selective data sharing between authorized parties only High transaction throughput suitable for institutional use Regulatory compliance built into the network design Interoperability with existing financial systems This specialized approach makes the Canton Network ETF particularly appealing to investors seeking exposure to enterprise-grade blockchain solutions. The network’s focus on privacy and compliance addresses two major hurdles that have traditionally limited institutional blockchain adoption. What Challenges Might the Canton Network ETF Face? While the filing represents exciting progress, several challenges remain. Regulatory approval processes for cryptocurrency ETFs have proven complex and time-consuming. The SEC has historically been cautious about approving crypto-related investment products, particularly those involving newer technologies. Additionally, investor education will be crucial. Many traditional investors may not fully understand the distinction between investing in a blockchain network versus investing in cryptocurrencies themselves. The success of this Canton Network ETF will depend on clear communication about what exactly investors are gaining exposure to. What Does This Mean for the Future of Blockchain Investing? The 21Shares Canton Network ETF filing signals a maturation in the digital asset space. It demonstrates that investment firms recognize the value in blockchain infrastructure beyond just cryptocurrency tokens. This development could pave the way for more specialized blockchain ETFs focusing on specific technological aspects rather than broad market exposure. As blockchain technology continues evolving, we may see more investment products targeting specific use cases and technological innovations. The Canton Network ETF could become the blueprint for future infrastructure-focused digital asset funds. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Canton Network? The Canton Network is a privacy-focused Layer 1 blockchain designed specifically for financial institutions, enabling secure and compliant transactions between authorized parties. When will the Canton Network ETF be available? The ETF is currently in the filing stage with regulatory authorities. Approval timelines vary, but the process typically takes several months. How is this ETF different from Bitcoin or Ethereum ETFs? Unlike cryptocurrency ETFs that track digital asset prices, the Canton Network ETF provides exposure to blockchain infrastructure technology rather than cryptocurrency tokens themselves. Who can invest in this ETF? Once approved, the ETF will be available to all investors through traditional brokerage accounts, similar to other exchange-traded funds. What are the risks of investing in blockchain technology ETFs? Rights include regulatory uncertainty, technological adoption rates, market volatility, and the emerging nature of blockchain infrastructure investments. Why did 21Shares choose the Canton Network for this ETF? 21Shares likely selected the Canton Network due to its unique privacy features, institutional focus, and potential for widespread financial application adoption.

According to its projections, holders of these top assets could see their portfolios bulge by Christmas. The Federal Reserve’s recent 25-basis-point rate cut has greenlit investors for risk-on sentiment. Despite this, crypto markets have suffered a protracted pullback, with Bitcoin bottoming around $93,000 in the early hours of today UTC. However, crypto markets historically operate in cycles, with steep corrections often marking the transition between phases. These resets help clear leverage, restore healthy market structure, and set the stage for the next major upward move. Here’s why Alibaba’s AI expects XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum to surge when markets rebound. XRP (XRP): Alibaba AI Predicts a Near 600% Rally Before New Year Alibaba’s model estimates that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could surge into the $10–$15 range before year-end, a potential increase of over 560% from its current value near $2.33. Source: Alibaba’s Qwen3-MAX XRP soared to $3.65 in July after Ripple secured a key legal win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, marking its highest level in seven years. Over the last 12 months, XRP has jumped roughly 112%, decisively outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ripple’s introduction of its RLUSD stablecoin, persistent engagement with global regulators, and CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s policy outreach in Washington have all helped solidify XRP’s image as a regulation-friendly asset with possible influence over emerging U.S. crypto policy. On the technical side, XRP has been moving within a tight consolidation channel since midsummer, between support at $2 and resistance around $3.50. With an RSI around 47, the token retains room for upward movement, although a sustained rally hinges on external catalysts. Canary Capital’s spot XRP ETF was listed on Nasdaq, but it failed to light the fuse on a rally due to ongoing bearishness, and several XRP ETFs are still pending due to a partial US government shutdown that ended last week. Alibaba believes further spot ETF approvals, major banking partnerships, or sweeping regulatory clarity could propel XRP as high as $15 by 2026. Bitcoin ($BTC): Alibaba AI Sees Santa Bringing $150,000 BTC Bitcoin ($BTC) remains the market’s dominant asset, recently setting a new all-time high at $126,080 on October 6. Alibaba’s predictive models suggest Bitcoin could stage a new breakout, potentially climbing toward the $150,000 mark by 2026. Often described as digital gold, Bitcoin attracts institutional and retail capital as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty. It currently capitalizes $1.9 trillion of the total $3.33 trillion crypto market. However, with inflation cooling and the likelihood of increased risk appetite by Christmas, Bitcoin could soon revisit record levels. The Fed’s recent decision to further slash interest rates could act as a catalyst for a strong Q4 run. Organic market momentum could realistically push Bitcoin back to $125,000. Alibaba’s $150k projection is also feasible, but such a timely recovery would be greatly helped if the U.S. administration makes good on its word to deliver a comprehensive legislative framework for crypto companies. Ethereum (ETH): Alibaba Forecasts a Surge Toward $15,000 As the backbone of decentralized applications, smart contracts, and the broader DeFi landscape, Ethereum ($ETH) continues to command a powerful position. With a market cap of $384.5 billion and more than $72 billion in total value locked , Ethereum remains the industry’s leading programmable blockchain. Alibaba’s AI models predict ETH could accelerate toward $15,000 by year-end, an anticipated 373% jump from its current price near $3,173. Further upside could materialize if the Trump administration rolls out sweeping crypto-friendly policies, giving institutions the regulatory clarity needed to scale exposure. Ethereum’s security, settlement reliability, and leadership in real-world asset tokenization and stablecoins make it a prime beneficiary of institutional inflows. ETH faces heavy resistance in the upper $4,000 region. A decisive breakout could support a run toward a new all-time high near $6,000 by late November. If holiday trading momentum strengthens, Alibaba believes Ethereum could approach the $15,000 threshold by Christmas. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A High-Energy Meme Coin Gaining Rapid Traction Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is emerging as one of the most talked-about new meme tokens, attracting significant buzz across the crypto community. With more than $4 million raised so far in its presale, MAXI blends classic Dogecoin’s fun and irreverence with more efficient blockchain tech and community-building. Marketed as Dogecoin’s wilder gigachad cousin, Maxi Doge aims to revive the original degen vibe of meme-coin culture: chaotic and fun. The project emphasizes community building through meme contests, interactive campaigns, and a fast-growing social presence. Launched as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI benefits from the network’s energy efficiency, scalability improvements, and robust developer ecosystem, advantages over Dogecoin’s legacy proof-of-work architecture. Out of the total 150.24 billion MAXI supply, 25% is allocated to the “Maxi Fund” to support marketing and ecosystem growth. Staking is currently live, offering returns of up to 76% APY, though the rate will decrease as participation increases. The presale price is set at $0.0002685, with incremental raises planned in upcoming stages. Investors can purchase MAXI through MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Seasoned crypto traders see the pullback as temporary, and in many ways necessary, to the continual growth of a robust, no-nonsense crypto market. Market resets like this flush out excess leverage and speculative excess, helping build the foundation for stronger, more durable uptrends later on. Additionally, it’s clear that Bitcoin, with its dominant “store of value” narrative, probably won’t be the leader of the next bull run, as there are tokens that will play a larger role in crypto’s institutional use-cases. Here’s why XRP, Solana, and Dash are top contenders for the next major bull cycle. XRP (XRP): Powering the Next Generation of Global Transactions Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) continues to transform cross-border payments through its fast, low-cost blockchain settlement system that has the potential to make SWIFT obsolete. The technology has been highlighted in reports from the UN Capital Development Fund and the White House, while Ripple continues to garner high-profile partnerships with major financial institutions. This has helped XRP solidify its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, supported by a market cap near $137 billion. Ripple’s RLUSD, a U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin, underscores its commitment to gaining a foothold in what many experts view as the most vital future segment of digital payments. Every RLUSD transaction on the XRP Ledger requires a small XRP burn, directly linking network usage to long-term token valuation. XRP has surged 112% over the past year, hitting $3.65 in July, its first new all-time high since 2018. For comparison, Bitcoin gained only 5% across the same period. If U.S. regulators approve spot crypto ETFs and pass Project Crypto, the proposed regulatory framework for digital assets, analysts believe XRP could realistically aim for $10 or higher by early 2026. Solana (SOL): Ethereum’s Biggest Competitor Sets Sights on $1,000 Solana ($SOL) has established itself as one of the fastest and most scalable smart-contract platforms in the industry. With an $79 billion market cap and $9.4 billion in total value locked (TVL), Solana remains the second-largest DeFi ecosystem after Ethereum. This year’s approval of Grayscale and Bitwise Solana spot ETFs on the New York Stock Exchange opened the door for fresh institutional inflows, a catalyst that previously fueled major rallies in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. After dipping to roughly $100 earlier in the year, SOL has rebounded to about $142. Technical indicators show a bullish flag structure forming since mid-September, and analysts highlight the $150 region as a critical support zone, with major resistance expected around $250. A decisive breakout above that band could allow Solana to retest its previous all-time high of $293.31 and potentially extend toward $450. In a strong 2026 cycle. In a bull cycle, SOL could even push toward the $1,000 mark. Dash ($DASH): A Bitcoin Fork Outperformed Both Bitcoin and XRP in the Last Year Dash ($DASH) is a digital currency designed to make everyday payments fast, inexpensive, and user-friendly. Originally launched in 2014 as a fork of Bitcoin, its name, short for “Digital Cash,” reflects its mission to function as a practical medium of exchange. One of Dash’s defining features is its two-tier network. Regular miners secure the blockchain, while masternodes handle advanced functions such as InstantSend and ChainLocks. InstantSend allows transactions to settle within seconds, making Dash suitable for real-world purchases, while ChainLocks helps protect the network against 51% attacks. Dash once gained significant traction as a payment solution in regions with unstable currencies, most notably in parts of Latin America. Although its popularity has fluctuated with market cycles, the project continues to focus on merchant adoption, low-fee transactions, and ongoing protocol upgrades. In the last 30 days, Dash has blown up 86% while its current price of $84 has not deviated far from its 30-day moving average. A relatively neutral relative strength index of 52 suggests there’s plenty of headroom to gro,w and Dash’s rally may well continue through this week. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): A Meme Coin With Practical Utility and Layer-2 Scaling Power One newcomer tipped to be a 2026 runaway success story is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a genuine blockchain infrastructure project that comes in a meme coin package. HYPER delivers real utility as a Bitcoin Layer-2 protocol, designed to boost throughput, cut fees, and introduce smart-contract capabilities to Bitcoin. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper supports DAO governance and features a Canonical bridge to seamlessly move your Bitcoin between chains. The project has already secured $27.8 million during its presale, with analysts such as Borch Crypto predicting potential gains of up to 100×. A recent audit from Coinsult found no security vulnerabilities in the smart contract, strengthening investor confidence. The HYPER token fuels staking mechanisms, network fees, and platform governance, and early presale participants can earn up to 41% APY. Bitcoin is going $HYPER in 2026!

The asset manager, which manages about $1.6 trillion, disclosed that the product is scheduled to begin trading on November 18 once regulatory conditions are met. The move forms one of the first fully structured spot XRP ETF frameworks filed in the United States and adds to a growing slate of crypto-related submissions awaiting SEC review. 🚨 🚨 BREAKING NEWS: Coinbase Custody will serve as the custodian for Franklin Templeton’s spot XRP ETF (ticker: EZRP).This is confirmed in the final prospectus filed with the SEC and in Franklin Templeton’s official announcements. $1.6T FT will launch tomorrow November 18 pic.twitter.com/O7vMJ0BBez — Kenny Nguyen (@mrnguyen007) November 17, 2025 The fund, which would trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange, is intended to offer exposure to XRP, currently the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Coinbase Custody would safeguard the ETF’s XRP assets, while Coinbase, operating separately, would act as the prime broker for trade execution services. CSC Delaware Trust Company would oversee trust management responsibilities as trustee. Franklin Templeton stated that the ETF shares will be issued and redeemed at net asset value through authorized participants, consistent with other spot crypto ETF mechanisms. Key Disclosures in the Filing The net asset value of the fund would be based on the CME CF XRP -Dollar Reference Rate, a standard asset price index that is typically applied across financial products in the digital-asset sector. In the framework described in the filing, the sponsor of the fund, Franklin Holdings, has consented to pay the majority of typical operating expenses in exchange with a sponsor fee. The trust is classified as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, which provides it with some reporting accommodations in its initial years of operation. The SEC acknowledged the filing within days of multiple other XRP ETF submissions , including Grayscale’s February 14 application, which initiated a 240-day review process. The acknowledgment marked the first time the regulator has formally responded to proposals involving investment products that directly hold XRP, even as the SEC continues its separate litigation against Ripple Labs concerning XRP’s regulatory classification. Institutional XRP Products Begin to Expand There has been an increase in interest in XRP investment vehicles. Bitwise, just under two days after Franklin Templeton indicated that it would launch, began to announce that it would start trading its own spot XRP fund on November 20. The company claimed that its product is targeted at institutional investors, including hedge funds and family offices, who require a regulated investment in the asset. The new investment products on XRP have been given a boost by their recent market performance. Furthermore, the Canary Capital XRPC product generated approximately $58 million during its initial trading on the first day. An XRP-based product raised $243 million in its initial launch, outperforming the $111.7 million raised by the first launch of the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. Market Observations Following ETF Developments Although XRP has suffered a pullback following these product launches, analysts quoted by market trackers have noted that the downtrend occurred during an overall weak market period. In commentary, analysts, including E. Grag Crypto, Javon Marks, and Ripple Bull Winkle, assert that the recent price action was not in line with changes in ETF trading volumes. Their publicly issued evaluations cited historical price patterns and previous market responses, but failed to attribute the retracement to ETF-related activity.

CZ Unveils Binance Plans if Refunded $4.3 Billion Replying to an X user’s post on Monday asking what would happen to the settlement money if refunded, Zhao said it was a “delicate question.” Hi @cz_binance , I wonder if they will refund your $4.3 billion since you are pardoned? Asking for a friend. — Anndy Lian (@anndylian) November 16, 2025 “I appreciate the pardon already,” the newly pardoned crypto founder said. “There is a balance in asking for more vs ‘what is fair’ vs appreciating what you got already. Zhao said that should Binance see the $4.3 billion returned, the crypto company “will be investing that in America anyway, to show our appreciation.” “Haven’t asked yet, I think,” he added. Rep. Maxine Waters Lambasts Trump’s Pardon Of CZ News of Zhao’s intentions came nearly one month after he was pardoned by Trump for failing to maintain anti-money laundering safeguards at Binance back in 2023. Binance Holdings Limited itself pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act, failure to register as a money transmitting business, and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Binance agreed to pay over $4 billion in forfeiture, while Zhao was ordered to pay $50 million in fines in order to resolve the landmark crypto case . “Deeply grateful for today’s pardon and to President Trump for upholding America’s commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice,” Zhao wrote in an October 23 X post. “Will do everything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto and advance web3 worldwide.” However, not everyone was pleased with Zhao’s pardon , with Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) calling it a way to “effectively legitimize the crypto crime CZ was convicted of.” “Trump’s pardon of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao—who pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering and facilitating suspicious transactions with child abusers, drug dealers, and terrorists—is an appalling but unsurprising reflection of his presidency: one defined by corruption, self-interest, and loyalty to criminals over working-class American families,” she said in an October 2025 statement. It is still unclear whether or not Binance will reclaim the $4.3 billion.

With Tokenized Real Assets, Yes",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/fast-crypto-millionaires-not-with-memes-with-tokenized-real-assets-yes/,"Over the past few market cycles, meme tokens have dominated headlines with sudden rallies and viral surges. But 2025 is telling a different story. With volatility rising and investors becoming more selective, attention is shifting toward a sector that looks far more grounded: tokenized real assets. This is where new capital is flowing, and the narrative is no longer built on hype but on measurable economic foundations. One of the projects gaining momentum in this space is RentStac , a platform that tokenizes income-producing real estate and converts rental revenue into on-chain value. It is not driven by memes or social sentiment. It is built on predictable cash flow, legal structure and transparent yield mechanisms. And with a presale price still under 0.03 dollars, RentStac makes it possible to calculate the long-term potential using realistic numbers rather than speculation. Why Tokenized Real Assets Are Replacing Memecoins in Investor Portfolios Memecoins thrive on emotional cycles and social media waves. When sentiment flips, the support disappears instantly. Tokenized real assets operate in a fundamentally different way and are outperforming meme-based models for three reasons. Real underlying value Each token is linked to a physical asset that generates measurable income. Recurring and predictable cash flow Returns are driven by rental payments, not by hype or trends. Institutional adoption is accelerating Banks, asset managers and regulators are preparing for the real-world asset market to grow into the trillions. As the speculative phase of the market cools, investors are shifting toward projects that combine blockchain efficiency with the stability of traditional assets. RentStac sits exactly in this growing intersection. How RentStac Works and Why It Stands Out RentStac simplifies real estate tokenization. Each property is placed into a dedicated SPV, which isolates ownership and ensures legal clarity. Rental income from the property flows into staking pools, funds token buybacks and supports a deflationary supply model. Key features: • real rental income converted into on-chain yield • buybacks funded by actual revenue • governance rights for long-term holders • professional SPV structure with transparent ownership • presale entry still below 0.03 dollars This blend of real-world revenue and token-level incentives is attracting investors searching for structured, lower-volatility opportunities. The Sub 0.03 Dollar Presale That Is Drawing Attention The current presale price of RNS is 0.025 dollars with a 70 percent token bonus for contributions above 500 dollars. The final presale phase is listed at 0.055 dollars. This progression allows investors to measure potential returns based on clear, published pricing instead of hypothetical projections. How Much It Takes to Reach One Million: Updated Calculations For the first time in a market often driven by speculation, the numbers can be calculated directly using the current presale structure. Example with a 500 dollar contribution Current price: 0.025 dollars Bonus: 70 percent Token calculation: • 500 dollars divided by 0.025 = 20,000 RNS • 70 percent bonus = 14,000 RNS • Total = 34,000 RNS Value at the end of the presale at 0.055 dollars 34,000 RNS x 0.055 = 1,870 dollars Even before listings, the initial capital multiplies. Value when RNS reaches 1 dollar in a low, conservative scenario 34,000 RNS x 1 dollar = 34,000 dollars This is not an aggressive forecast but a level many analysts consider achievable for real-world asset tokens. The Updated Path to One Million Dollars To reach 1,000,000 dollars at a future price of 1 dollar, an investor needs exactly 1,000,000 RNS. With the current 70 percent bonus, the calculation is: 1,000,000 RNS divided by 1.70 = 588,235 RNS required Cost today: 588,235 RNS x 0.025 dollars = 14,705 dollars In other words, with an investment of roughly 14,700 dollars at today’s presale price, reaching the one-million mark at 1 dollar falls within a mathematically realistic scenario. Why Investors Are Looking Toward This Model Right Now The market narrative is shifting. Investors are no longer chasing volatility for its own sake. They are prioritizing real yield, transparent structure and projects tied to tangible economic activity. RentStac combines a low entry price, a legally compliant structure and a model directly linked to rental revenue. This places RNS among a small group of tokens under 0.03 dollars that offer a measurable, data-driven growth path instead of emotional trading cycles. With the presale still active and the final phase set at 0.055 dollars, many investors view this window as one of the last chances to enter before the market’s next structural shift.

Social Media Is Shifting Attention To Bitcoin According to data from analytics firm Santiment, social media talk has recently become more concentrated on Bitcoin. The indicator of relevance here is the “Social Dominance,” which measures the percentage of cryptocurrency-related discussions on social media that a given asset accounts for. Related Reading: Solana Air Gap: Analyst Says No Major Support Level Until $24 The metric gauges social media talk using the Social Volume indicator, which tracks the total number of posts/threads/comments that contain unique mentions of the coin. To give a relative measure, the Social Dominance takes the Social Volume of the asset and compares it against the combined Social Volume of the top 100 digital assets. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Social Dominance for Bitcoin and a few major altcoins over the last few months: As shown in the graph above, Bitcoin Social Dominance spiked on Friday as the cryptocurrency’s price crashed. At the peak of this surge, 36.4% of all cryptocurrency-related discussions involved BTC. This was the highest that the metric had been since July 13th, when its value touched a high of 37.6%. Interestingly, this previous spike coincided with a top for the asset. Historically, digital assets have tended to move in a way that goes contrary to the expectations of the majority, so too much excitement or FUD among the retail social media crowd can act as a reversal signal. The July high in Social Dominance signaled FOMO among the traders, which could be why Bitcoin’s bullish momentum paused then. Another example of the pattern came in August, when this time Ethereum saw a surge in its Social Dominance, reaching a peak value of 19.1%. Alongside this market excitement, BTC and others hit a top again. Given that the latest spike in the indicator has come with a market crash, it’s possible that the high amount of discussions points to panic among the investors. “Though not a guaranteed crypto bottom signal, probabilities of a market reversal greatly increases when social dominance for Bitcoin surges,” explained the analytics firm. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashes To $98,000 As HODLer Selling Accelerates The Social Dominance only contains information about social media platforms. One useful way of gauging the sentiment in the sector as a whole is through Alternative‘s Fear & Greed Index, which takes into account several factors, including social media data itself. During the weekend, the Fear & Greed Index fell to a value of just 10, indicating a strong extreme fear sentiment among Bitcoin investors. The last time the index went this low was in February, and the last time it was lower was all the way back during the 2022 bear market. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $95,300, down over 10% in the last week.

Canary Capital’s XRPC fund narrowly beat Solana’s BSOL ETF, but the token itself is down 11% over the past week, showing that institutional hype hasn’t yet translated into price strength. Congrats to $XRPC for $58m in Day One volume, the most of any ETF launched this year (out of 900), BARELY edging out $BSOL 's $57m. The two of them are in league of own tho as 3rd place is over $20m away. pic.twitter.com/MjsOeceeNb — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 13, 2025 During its first day of trading, XRP attracted $58.6 million, breaking this year’s record for crypto ETFs, previously set by Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETF (BSOL). Meanwhile, in just two days, XRPC more than doubled the assets under management (AUM) of the REX-Osprey fund. According to its official website, XRPC currently manages $248 million for investors, despite the market’s latest setback. This makes it the largest XRP-linked ETF in the U.S. stock market. Similar vehicles from Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, and CoinShares are waiting for the SEC’s nod to hit the trading floor soon. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Risks a 30% Drop if It Loses This Key Support The 4-hour chart shows that XRP’s downtrend has persisted despite the launch of the ETF. The token seems to have found support temporarily at around $2.15 – $2.22. However, if this demand area falters this week, we could see XRP dropping to $1.57. This is the price level from which it bounced during the October 10 flash crash. This means a 30.4% downside risk based on where the price is today. Nonetheless, if the $2.20 support level holds, XRP could recover to $3 rapidly, especially if market sentiment improves for an end-of- year “Christmas rally.” The launch of additional ETFs could reinforce this bullish scenario, as rising institutional interest may drive demand for the token. Meanwhile, as most altcoins remain under pressure, early-stage presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are quietly gaining traction. With over $4 million raised already, the presale is gathering serious momentum as it builds a trader-first meme coin community. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Reignites the Doge Spirit with a Bold New Vision for Crypto Traders Built on Ethereum and inspired by the original Doge meme, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is more than just another meme coin; it’s a fresh take on what made Doge iconic in the first place.

In addition, traders can compete against each other for attractive rewards and bragging rights through fun tournaments like Maxi Ripped and Maxi Gainz. Up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds will also be invested in promising tokens. The resulting gains will be used to finance marketing campaigns that raise the market’s awareness of $MAXI.

Authorities Seize Millions in Crypto From Convicted Twitter Hacker Despite US Conviction This week, the UK’s Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) confirmed it had secured a civil recovery order targeting 42.378 BTC, 235.329 ETH, 143,273.57 BUSD, and 15.23 USDC linked to O’Connor, now valued at roughly £4.1 million. The assets, once worth only a fraction of that amount at the time of the hack, will be liquidated by a court-appointed trustee. O’Connor, who now lives in Spain, did not participate in the London hearing, but his mother said he was willing to forfeit all remaining interest in the funds. O’Connor pleaded guilty in the United States to a long list of offenses, including computer intrusion conspiracies, wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, extortion, threatening communications, and stalking a 16-year-old victim. He was extradited from Spain and sentenced to five years in prison before being deported earlier this year. The CPS had previously obtained a Property Freezing Order during extradition proceedings to prevent the cryptocurrency from being moved. Adrian Foster, Chief Crown Prosecutor for the CPS Proceeds of Crime Division, said the case shows that authorities will pursue criminal profits even when convictions occur overseas. “We were able to use the full force of the powers available to us to ensure that even when someone is not convicted in the UK, we are still able to ensure they do not benefit from their criminality,” he said. Bitcoin Surge Amplifies Value of Assets Stolen in 2020 Twitter Hack Bitcoin’s rise has increased the value of O’Connor’s stolen holdings. At today’s price near $92,800, almost ten times higher than in mid-2020, the remaining assets ballooned to more than £4.1 million, prosecutors said. BTC Weekly Price Chart Source: Cryptonews The Twitter breach was one of the biggest social media security failures ever recorded. X, then Twitter, briefly locked down verified accounts as the scam spread to more than 350 million users. Investigators later said two unwitting British associates opened crypto accounts used by O’Connor but were not involved in the fraud. The case arrives during a period of heightened concern over crypto-related cybercrime, with governments worldwide reporting rapid growth in sophisticated digital extortion schemes. Law enforcement agencies have also pointed out a sharp rise in crypto laundering. According to Global Ledger data cited in the filings, hackers stole more than $3 billion across 119 incidents in the first eight months of 2025 alone, already surpassing 2024’s total by 1.5 times. Meanwhile, separate enforcement actions continue internationally. In November, the US Justice Department launched efforts to seize more than $15 million in USDT tied to North Korea’s APT38 hacking unit , connected to a series of major 2023 exchange breaches. The US DOJ is seeking to seize over $15 million in USDT tied to North Korean state-backed hacking unit APT38. #NorthKorea #Crypto https://t.co/LdPBVFKOhG — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 16, 2025 Europol also dismantled a cybercrime syndicate responsible for creating more than 49 million fake online accounts , including fraudulent profiles on crypto platforms, using a large-scale SIM-farm infrastructure. Despite rising global investigations, recent data suggests the industry is experiencing short-term improvements in security. October 2025 was recorded as the safest month of the year for crypto platforms, with only $18.18 million lost to hacks, an 85% drop from September.

BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes has just dropped a bombshell analysis that explains exactly what’s happening with the cryptocurrency market. His insights reveal why we’re facing a potential Bitcoin correction in the short term, but the long-term outlook remains incredibly bullish. Why is Bitcoin Facing a Short-Term Correction? Arthur Hayes points to a critical factor that many investors are overlooking: global U.S. dollar liquidity. Since April, we’ve seen a significant contraction in dollar liquidity worldwide. This liquidity squeeze is creating downward pressure on risk assets, including Bitcoin. Previously, Bitcoin enjoyed strong support from two key sources: ETF inflows that provided consistent buying pressure Corporate treasury purchases from companies holding digital assets However, Hayes explains these supportive factors have now diminished. The basis trade – the spread between futures and spot prices – is no longer attractive enough to drive sustained institutional ETF purchases. Moreover, most digital asset treasury companies are trading below their net asset value, reducing their ability to continue accumulating Bitcoin. How Does Liquidity Impact Bitcoin Prices? Liquidity acts like oxygen for financial markets. When dollar liquidity contracts, risk assets typically struggle. Hayes emphasizes that Bitcoin is now feeling this pressure directly. The withdrawal of institutional funds has left Bitcoin exposed to the broader liquidity crunch. But here’s the crucial insight: this Bitcoin correction is temporary. Hayes compares the current situation to 2023, when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s strategic moves injected $2.5 trillion into markets through increased short-term government bond issuance. When Will the Bitcoin Correction End? Hayes provides clear triggers for when we can expect liquidity to return. He suggests watch for these market signals: S&P and Nasdaq indices falling 10-20% 10-year U.S. Treasury yield approaching 5% Government intervention to support markets Once these conditions are met, Hayes expects the Trump administration and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to adopt a dual strategy. They’ll publicly address inflation concerns while privately injecting the liquidity needed to stabilize markets. What’s the Long-Term Bitcoin Price Target? Here’s where it gets exciting. Hayes believes this Bitcoin correction sets the stage for an enormous rally later this year. He projects Bitcoin could reach between $200,000 and $250,000 by year-end once liquidity begins flowing back into the market. The current period represents what Hayes calls a “necessary, brief correction” before the major market rally. This temporary Bitcoin correction is actually healthy for the long-term bull market, shaking out weak hands and creating better entry points for serious investors. FAQs About Bitcoin Correction and Market Outlook How long will this Bitcoin correction last? Hayes suggests the correction will be relatively brief, likely ending when market conditions trigger government liquidity injections. Should I sell my Bitcoin during this correction? Hayes views this as a temporary phase before a major rally. Long-term holders might consider holding through the volatility. What are the key indicators to watch? Monitor the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and 10-year Treasury yields for signals of when liquidity might return. How high could Bitcoin go after the correction? Hayes projects $200,000 to $250,000 by year-end if liquidity returns as expected. What’s driving the liquidity squeeze? Global dollar liquidity has been contracting since April, reducing support for risk assets like Bitcoin. Are institutional investors still buying Bitcoin? ETF inflows have slowed as the basis trade became less attractive, reducing institutional support temporarily. Share this crucial market analysis with fellow crypto enthusiasts!

The likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana have suffered minor drops today, on top of significant falls in the last seven days, with BTC actually down for the year at one point today. However, token fundamentals haven’t changed at all, and it’s likely that most major coins will make a big comeback once sentiment improves. Meanwhile, new and up-and-coming tokens have the potential to outpace the market, with the incoming launch of ERC-20 crypto PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) showing some real potential for gains. Best New Meme Coin to Buy Today – 17 November PEPENODE opened its presale in September, and has since gone on to raise $2.1 million from enthusiastic investors. The PEPENODE presale is live. Buy Nodes. Build Your Server Room. Combine Nodes For Huge Bonuses. Do it all here https://t.co/d1JAronqiv pic.twitter.com/60uLhEoukP — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 10, 2025 While the coin has assumed familiar memes, what sets it apart from the crowd is its unique mine-to-earn platform, which could see users earning significant rewards. The aim of this platform is to provide users with the ability to mine coins, without having to invest in expensive and resource-hungry hardware. Instead, users can build and run their own virtual mining rigs, using PEPENODE tokens to buy more virtual nodes. The more nodes they own, the greater their rewards will be. PEPENODE will pay out such rewards in external coins such as Pepe and Fartcoin, providing a strong incentive to engage with the platform. Not only that, but this system provides a strong incentive to accumulate more PEPENODE, given that you’ll need the coin to acquire more nodes. As such, the new token could experience significant and growing demand, which will gain a boost from the ability to stake it for a passive income. In fact, PEPENODE is currently paying out yields of 597% APY, making it a hugely profitable token to hold. How to Join the PEPENODE Presale Before It’s Too Late This explains why PEPENODE is the best new meme coin to buy today, with investors able to join its presale by going to its official website. The token is currently available to buy at a price of $0.00115, although this will rise again later today. It will continue to rise at intervals until the sale ends, so interested traders should act sooner rather than later. Given its tokenomics and fundamentals, it has the potential to rise strongly once it lists in the coming weeks. This should be the case even if the market remains in an uncertain condition, although it could absolutely rocket if things take a more bullish turn.

Here’s the Total Position Size,https://timestabloid.com/top-trader-opens-massive-xrp-short-heres-the-total-position-size/,"Market sentiment deteriorated further over the weekend as cryptocurrency prices continued to weaken, prompting several high-risk traders to open sizable leveraged short positions across multiple digital assets. Data from the analytics platform Lookonchain indicates that a well-known high-volume bettor associated with Roobet and Stake.com initiated a new series of strongly leveraged short positions involving Bitcoin, XRP, and Zcash. According to the publicly available figures, the trader activated positions totaling approximately $196 million in notional value. The allocation involved 40x leverage for Bitcoin, 20x for XRP, and 10x for Zcash. The breakdown includes 1,555.56 BTC ($148.5 million), 12.34 million XRP ($27.4 million), and 31,016 ZEC ($20.4 million). These positions were opened during a period when Bitcoin temporarily fell to $92,900, coinciding with the Fear & Greed Index dropping to 10, a level not observed since 2022.

The token has recorded a weekly decline of more than 0.64%, trading near $2.16 despite the recent introduction of multiple XRP-based exchange-traded funds . Several market participants have argued that XRP remains mispriced relative to its fundamentals and that further corrections are likely. A prominent trader known as Crashius Clay reiterated his earlier views, forecasting that XRP could reach $0.20. He stated that, in his view, the asset would still be overvalued even at that level. His concerns focus on reduced retail participation, weakening demand, and rising competition from stablecoins. He also cited the declining performance of the XRP/BTC pair, noting that the pair’s current trend indicates deteriorating relative strength against Bitcoin. Consistency With Previous Critiques Clay’s renewed warnings reflect comments he made in October when he described XRP as one of the most compelling short positions of the current market cycle. In his earlier assessment, he asserted that structural changes in global payments had limited the asset’s original value proposition. He referenced developments involving stablecoins, emerging central bank digital currency initiatives, and SWIFT’s blockchain-based shared ledger, which has support from financial institutions such as JPMorgan and HSBC. According to him, these developments reduce the likelihood that XRP will gain a central role in global settlement systems. Clay has previously disclosed successful trades involving XRP shorts. Earlier this year, he reported shorting positions totaling $1 million, which he claimed produced more than $800,000 in gains during a significant market drawdown. He has also referred to XRP as one of the most straightforward short opportunities he has encountered in his trading activity.

Supporters emphasize Ripple’s ongoing efforts to expand internationally, its partnerships with financial institutions, and the continued rollout of regulated investment products such as spot ETFs. Several analysts continue to argue that XRP could reach valuations between $8 and $10 before the end of the year. However, this perspective remains highly debated in current market conditions. The opposing views between leveraged traders and long-term supporters highlight the increasing uncertainty surrounding XRP’s price trajectory, with near-term volatility likely to remain elevated as macroeconomic factors and market liquidity continue to shift.

The landscape has dramatically shifted from optimistic to cautious as BTC’s sharp decline to $91,000 sends shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community. This sudden reversal in market sentiment has left both traders and analysts scrambling to understand what comes next for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Why Are Bitcoin Prediction Markets Turning Bearish? The recent market movement has fundamentally changed how prediction markets view Bitcoin’s future trajectory. According to Coindesk reports, platforms like Polymarket have completely abandoned their previous bullish scenarios. Instead, they now describe the current situation as a potential structural collapse that could reshape the market cycle. This shift represents a significant departure from earlier optimism. Prediction markets now anticipate gradual declines rather than the sharp recovery many had hoped for. The breach of key technical levels, including the 50-week moving average, has triggered this reassessment among market participants. What Do Trading Firms Say About This Market Shift? Major trading firms echo the concerns emerging from Bitcoin prediction markets. QCP Capital openly admitted they were unprepared for Bitcoin’s drop below the critical $100,000 threshold. The firm characterized this movement as an inflection point that traders are still processing. Key factors driving this sentiment shift include: Breach of the 50-week moving average Loss of psychological $100,000 support Changing institutional positioning Revised technical analysis scenarios How Are Prediction Markets Adjusting Their Forecasts? Bitcoin prediction markets are now recalibrating their year-end price expectations. Polymarket’s abrupt reversal demonstrates how quickly sentiment can change in cryptocurrency markets. The platform now projects a gradual downtrend rather than expecting immediate recovery. This adjustment in Bitcoin prediction markets reflects deeper concerns about market structure. Analysts are watching whether this represents a temporary correction or the beginning of a more sustained bearish phase. The data from these markets provides valuable insights into collective market intelligence. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Investors? The changing signals from Bitcoin prediction markets suggest investors should prepare for increased volatility. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, the current data points toward more cautious positioning. However, experienced traders know that market sentiment can shift rapidly. Important considerations for investors include: Diversification across different time horizons Risk management strategies Monitoring multiple data sources beyond prediction markets Understanding that markets often overreact in both directions Will Bitcoin Prediction Markets Regain Their Bullish Stance? The future direction of Bitcoin prediction markets depends on several factors. Market participants will closely watch for stabilization above key support levels and institutional flow patterns. Historical data shows that prediction markets can quickly revert to bullish outlooks when fundamental conditions improve. Currently, the consensus from Bitcoin prediction markets suggests patience is warranted. The structural concerns raised by recent price action need time to resolve. Meanwhile, traders should monitor these markets for early signs of sentiment shifts. Conclusion: Navigating the New Market Reality The dramatic reversal in Bitcoin prediction markets serves as a powerful reminder of cryptocurrency volatility. While the shift from bullish to bearish outlook may concern some investors, it also creates opportunities for those who understand market cycles. The current reassessment provides valuable data points for making informed decisions in these unpredictable markets. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin prediction markets? Bitcoin prediction markets are platforms where traders can bet on future cryptocurrency prices and events, providing collective intelligence about market expectations. Why did prediction markets turn bearish? Prediction markets turned bearish after Bitcoin broke below $100,000 and its 50-week moving average, signaling potential structural changes in the market cycle. How reliable are prediction market forecasts? While prediction markets aggregate crowd wisdom, they’re not infallible and should be used alongside other analysis tools for comprehensive market understanding. What time frame do prediction markets consider? Most Bitcoin prediction markets focus on short to medium-term forecasts, typically ranging from weeks to several months ahead. Can prediction markets quickly become bullish again? Yes, prediction markets can rapidly shift sentiment based on new market data, regulatory developments, or changing institutional flows.

In that filing, Larry and Sergey told investors who shaped their thinking, where their ideas came from, when they learned from them, why they used that model, and which document guided their structure. The two men titled their founders’ letter “An Owner’s Manual for Google’s Shareholders,” and added a footnote saying much of the letter was inspired by Warren’s essays in Berkshire Hathaway’s annual reports and Berkshire’s own manual. Buffett shows his admiration with a major Alphabet stake The story circled back more than two decades later, when Berkshire Hathaway disclosed late Friday who made a new investment, where the money went, when the filing was completed, why it matters for the company’s strategy, and which filing confirmed it. The document revealed that Berkshire now owns a stake worth about $4.3 billion in Alphabet, making it the firm’s 10th biggest equity holding. That news pushed Alphabet shares up 3% on Monday, as trading desks reacted to a rare tech position from a company that usually stays far away from fast‑growth names. This is the first time Berkshire is known to hold a position in Google, which is unusual because Warren has avoided the sector for most of his investing life. The timing stands out too: Warren, now 95, is stepping down as CEO at the end of this year, with Greg Abel preparing to take over. This means the Alphabet stake will be part of Berkshire’s portfolio as leadership shifts. The regret has been on record for years. In 2017, Warren said he should have bought Google long before, especially because Geico, the Berkshire‑owned insurer, was paying large advertising bills to Google’s network. He also said he missed Amazon, which Berkshire finally bought in 2019 and still holds roughly $2.2 billion of. Google’s financial strength forces Berkshire to pay attention The buying interest came during a year when Alphabet shares rose 50%, sitting just below their all‑time high reached last week. The company reported its first $100 billion quarter in the third period, driven by Google Cloud, which handles the firm’s artificial intelligence tools.The cloud unit holds a $155 billion backlog, showing long‑term customer commitments. Alphabet also rolled out new chips for its AI services, which puts it in the same field as companies racing to build advanced hardware for AI workloads. Even with strong results, Alphabet trades cheaper than most AI‑focused giants. The stock sits at 26 times next year’s earnings, while Microsoft trades at 32, Broadcom at 51 and Nvidia at 42. Those numbers explain why investors say Alphabet still looks less expensive than its competitors. The financial rise of Larry and Sergey reflects Google’s growth. Forbes lists them seventh and eighth on its billionaires ranking. Warren sits at sixth, putting all three close together on the global wealth list. The IPO prospectus showed how deeply Warren influenced Google’s foundation. Larry and Sergey wrote that outside pressure often pushes companies to give up long‑term plans for short‑term numbers.

But tonight, we’re going to introduce him to you as the newest AI bear on the Street. When I first heard about Peter’s decision to dump the entirety of his Nvidia holdings, I instantly realized that it made sense. There was no confusion. This is a man who has been investing since the 90s and has seen more market cycles than this author has seen birthdays, yet he walked away from a company Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and Washington have all been worshipping all year, and the 13F filing showed he did it right after Nvidia crossed $5 trillion. Anyway, the 13F filing also showed Pete cutting Tesla by more than 76%, though the EV giant is still his biggest holding at the end of September, according to InsiderScore. The stock rallied by 40% in Q3, has dropped more than 7% so far this quarter, and is barely up 3% for the year. Yet, he kept over 20% of it anyway. Meanwhile, he added over $25 million in Microsoft and more than $20 million in Apple, which says a lot, because this man doesn’t usually hide inside megacaps unless he wants insulation. The funny part is that everyone acts surprised. But if you look at Peter’s history, you shouldn’t be. He has always cut when people get euphoric. And he has always bet where he believes power shifts next. Or where he plans to shift it behind the scenes, if you know what I mean. A look into Peter’s rewired portfolio Peter’s portfolio has always been weirdly fascinating. Since the 90s, the guy has loaded up on tech, crypto, recently healthcare, and almost nothing from Europe, which is quite odd for a man who has been on Wall Street this long. He was early in Facebook, early in Palantir, early in Bitcoin and Ethereum, early in crazy national-security startups no one had ever heard of until they showed up in congressional hearings. He was never the “buy the S&P” type. He puts his money where disruption happens, or where he thinks civilization needs pressure points. As of press time, Palantir is 77.86% of Peter’s entire portfolio , worth $17.459 billion across 100,335,000 shares. The second-largest holding is Airbnb, worth $3.24 billion at 14.45%, followed by Affirm at $1.275 billion with 5.69%. After that comes healthcare for Peter. He holds Oscar Health ( worth$299.834 million), AbCellera ($52.99 million), BlackSky ($30.713 million), Invivyd ($26.418 million), Chemomab ($15.05 million), a tiny slice of Meta ($8.467 million), and Fractyl Health ($8.079 million). He built Founders Fund in 2005 with Sean Parker, Ken Howery, and Luke Nosek. Later, they pumped money into hypersensitive national-security firms like Palantir, Anduril, and General Matter. They even have a plan to bring ultraviolet lithography production onshore. Inside his circle, the fund is literally nicknamed “the Precious.” Pater has put cash into everything from Airbnb, Spotify, Quora, Nanotronics, Stripe, SpaceX, PsiQuantum, Rigetti, Bullish Global, and ResearchGate. In 2017, Founders Fund threw $15–20 million into Bitcoin, and by early 2018, those holdings had climbed into the hundreds of millions. He also backed Clearview AI, which made headlines for reasons everyone remembers. Since 2024, Founders Fund has incubated Valinor Enterprises, invested $85 million into SentientAGI to challenge OpenAI and Perplexity, and funded Impulse Space, Ramp, and Crusoe. In 2025, they added Erebor, EnduroSat, Varda, and Hadrian. The man has been betting on everything from satellites to quantum computing to space medicine. Thiel seemingly sides with Altman against Elon Musk with Nvidia somehow a part of it The other force shaping this whole thing is the increasingly interesting Sam Altman. As you may know, Sammy and Elon Musk have been snapping at each other for years. They co-founded OpenAI in 2015, but Elon had to leave in 2018, and they’ve been throwing shots ever since. OpenAI and xAI compete directly now. Sam wants OpenAI public in 2027, and Wall Street expects the IPO to be huge. In the meantime, Sam likes to rage bait Elon on his own platform X, with posts that seem purposefully aimed to enact a reaction out of Elon completely unprovoked. Meanwhile, Sam and Peter get along pretty well. Sam has called him a mentor multiple times and has received “advice” from him on how to run OpenAI since as far back as 2017. Elon and Peter, on the other hand, have quite a messy history. They worked together at PayPal, but Peter and his allies pushed Elon out while he was on his honeymoon. One source said Elon sees Peter as “a sociopath.” Peter sees Elon as “a fraud.” Elon never trusted him again after that. An investor who has attended their shareholder events would tell you their personalities never matched. See Elon is loud and impulsive, while Peter is quiet and calculated. Basically, Elon bets the house and Peter plays defense. Peter’s exit followed SoftBank’s massive offload and came at a point when Michael Burry was taking huge put positions against Nvidia and Palantir. James Anderson flat-out said Nvidia’s proposed $100 billion financing idea for OpenAI was “disconcerting.” As surprising as it may be also, Jensen Huang is a part of this too. The Nvidia CEO has been cosying up to Elon in public, something he only does with people he is really close with (there have been very few). Jensen and Elon now hype each other on X, speak kindly about each other in interviews, and have mentioned each other in at least 2 earnings calls this year. The author of this article believes that what we’re seeing is two alliances forming. On one side, Peter and Sam. On the other, Jensen and Elon.

That’s exactly what institutions have been doing with stablecoins, according to Aleo’s groundbreaking new report. The stablecoin privacy gap has reached alarming proportions, exposing massive financial flows to public scrutiny. What is the Stablecoin Privacy Gap? Aleo’s ‘Stablecoin Privacy Gap Report 2025’ reveals a stunning disconnect in institutional cryptocurrency behavior. While institutions transferred $1.22 trillion in stablecoins over two years, they completely avoided privacy protocols. This massive stablecoin privacy oversight means every transaction remained publicly visible on blockchain explorers. The report highlights how traditional financial institutions have carried their transparency requirements into the crypto space. However, this approach creates significant security and competitive disadvantages. Meanwhile, only $624 million in stablecoins entered privacy protocols during the same period, with zero institutional participation. Why Are Institutions Avoiding Stablecoin Privacy? Several factors explain this surprising stablecoin privacy avoidance. Regulatory uncertainty remains the primary concern. Many institutions fear that using privacy tools might trigger compliance issues or regulatory scrutiny. Regulatory concerns about using privacy-enhancing technologies Lack of institutional-grade privacy solutions until recently Compliance requirements that prioritize transparency Limited understanding of available stablecoin privacy options Moreover, dedicated stablecoin privacy rails for institutions only began emerging this year. The infrastructure simply wasn’t available for large-scale institutional use until now. Emerging Solutions for Stablecoin Privacy The landscape is rapidly changing with new stablecoin privacy solutions entering the market. PayPal’s PYUSD now offers confidential transfer features, while Paxos launched USAD, a privacy-focused stablecoin. These developments signal a major shift in institutional stablecoin privacy approaches. Aleo predicts that institutional funds will begin migrating to these new stablecoin privacy rails in the coming months. The report suggests that once the first major institutions adopt these solutions, others will quickly follow to maintain competitive parity. What Does This Mean for Crypto Adoption? The stablecoin privacy gap represents both a challenge and opportunity for broader cryptocurrency adoption. Institutions need privacy for legitimate business reasons, including protecting trade strategies and client information. Without proper stablecoin privacy solutions, mainstream adoption faces significant hurdles. However, the emergence of compliant stablecoin privacy tools could accelerate institutional participation. When institutions can balance transparency requirements with necessary privacy protections, we’ll likely see increased stablecoin adoption across traditional finance. The Future of Stablecoin Privacy Aleo’s report concludes that we’re standing at the brink of a major transformation in stablecoin privacy practices. The coming year will likely see billions, potentially trillions, migrating to privacy-enhanced stablecoin solutions. This shift will fundamentally change how institutions interact with digital assets. The stablecoin privacy revolution isn’t just coming—it’s already begun, with major financial players preparing to adopt these new technologies. Frequently Asked Questions What is stablecoin privacy? Stablecoin privacy refers to technologies that conceal transaction details while maintaining regulatory compliance, allowing institutions to protect sensitive financial information. Why do institutions need stablecoin privacy? Institutions require stablecoin privacy to protect trade strategies, client information, and competitive advantages while meeting compliance obligations. Are privacy features compliant with regulations? New stablecoin privacy solutions like PYUSD confidential transfers are designed specifically to meet regulatory requirements while providing necessary privacy protections. When will institutions adopt privacy features? Aleo predicts large-scale migration to stablecoin privacy rails will begin within the coming months as more institutional-grade solutions become available. What are the risks of not using privacy features? Without stablecoin privacy, institutions expose transaction patterns, amounts, and counterparties to competitors and potential bad actors. Which stablecoins offer privacy features? Currently, PayPal’s PYUSD and Paxos’s USAD lead in institutional stablecoin privacy features, with more solutions expected soon.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has struggled to regain bullish momentum, currently hovering near $3,150 after weeks of consistent selling pressure. However, new on-chain data from CryptoQuant reveals that Ethereum might be nearing a crucial accumulation zone — one historically associated with long-term holder activity and market bottoms. Related Reading: Massive Bitcoin Bid Walls Spotted On Binance: Bulls Step In With 2,800 BTC Cluster According to the report, the ETH price is now just 8% away from touching the Accumulation Addresses Realized Price level at $2,895. This metric represents the average cost basis of long-term investors who have been steadily stacking ETH during previous market cycles. A move toward this level could signal the final stages of the ongoing correction, potentially attracting renewed interest from strategic buyers looking for value entries. Historically, similar declines toward the realized price of accumulation addresses have acted as strong support zones, leading to price stabilization and subsequent recoveries. While short-term sentiment remains fearful, the proximity to this key level suggests that Ethereum could soon reach a point where long-term investors begin accumulating once again — setting the stage for a potential market rebound. Long-Term Holders Stay Unshaken According to CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci, the $2,895 level represents the average cost basis of long-term Ethereum accumulators — investors who have been “patiently stacking” through multiple market cycles. This group tends to buy during periods of maximum fear, forming a stable foundation for future rallies. Historically, Ethereum has only dipped below this key level once, during the April 2025 Trump tax-tariff crisis, when global markets faced extreme uncertainty. The Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (GEPUCURRENT) surged to 629 points, surpassing even the COVID-19 pandemic peak by 50%. Despite the widespread panic, long-term holders continued to accumulate aggressively rather than sell. In fact, 2025 saw around 17 million ETH flow into accumulation addresses, raising the total balance held by these wallets from 10 million to over 27 million ETH. This trend highlights the conviction of Ethereum’s strongest investors, who have repeatedly viewed fear-driven sell-offs as opportunities. If Ethereum were to decline another 8%, it would reach this cost basis once again. Historically, this level has acted as one of the strongest long-term accumulation zones, signaling value and resilience. As Kesmeci notes, even if ETH briefly dips below $2,900, it’s unlikely to remain there for long. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Expands Position By 36,437 ETH – Bringing Total To $1.34B Ethereum Holds Above Key Support as Market Tests Long-Term Confidence Ethereum’s weekly chart shows that the asset is holding above a key structural support zone near $3,000, after several weeks of downside pressure. The price briefly dipped below this level last week but recovered quickly, forming a potential short-term base around the 200-week moving average — a historically significant line that has supported major bottoms in past cycles. Currently trading around $3,190, ETH is attempting to maintain stability within this critical range. The 50-week moving average remains slightly above at $3,500, serving as immediate resistance. A break above that level would be an early signal of renewed bullish momentum, while losing $3,000 could trigger a deeper correction toward $2,800–$2,900, which aligns closely with the Accumulation Realized Price highlighted by CryptoQuant analysts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Leverage Cooldown Signals Market Reset: OI Drops 21% As Excess Risk Is Flushed Out The recent decline mirrors past phases of market reset, such as the April 2025 correction, where Ethereum similarly tested long-term supports before rebounding strongly.

54549999,629257,1763431241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54549999.jpeg,Bitcoin Bear Market: Confirmed Or False Alarm? Experts Sound Off,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bear-market-confirmed-or-false-alarm/,"Bitcoin’s drop back into the mid-$90,000s has reignited the debate: is this the start of a true bear market, or a sharp reset inside an ongoing uptrend? Analysts are converging on the same battleground levels but differ on what they imply. Has The Bitcoin Bear Market Arrived? Macro swing-trader “The Great Mattsby” (@matthughes13) argues that, structurally, Bitcoin is still tracking a familiar pattern. He reminds followers that: “Back in 2024, BTC consolidated for 7 months in the $70k-$50k zone before breaking out.” Using monthly Fibonacci retracements from the March 2024 high to the November 2022 low, he notes that Bitcoin previously tagged the 0.618 retracement at $51,518, “even wicked below, then bounced.” On a fresh set of fibs drawn from the October 2025 top to the August 2024 low, that same key level now sits at $96,975. Price is currently trading slightly below it, similar to the 2024 wick. With two weeks left in November, Mattsby stresses that the close matters more than the intramonth volatility: “If BTC holds this $96-$97k zone for a monthly candle close in November, this could mirror last year’s setup: a couple more months retesting this zone, then a run to new all-time highs would be possible.” On the weekly timeframe, however, market analyst Rekt Capital is less comfortable with the latest breakdown. For him, the 50-week exponential moving average has been a core “bullish structure” of this cycle. He writes: “Bear Markets confirm when the bullish structures that supported continued bullish momentum start to fail.” His chart shows the current weekly candle pushing decisively below the 50-week EMA, which has previously acted as support. He sees “a high probability the Weekly Candle Closes below the 50-week EMA,” adding that the reaction in the coming weeks will be “macro trend-defining.” The key question, in his view: “Can BTC produce enough upside in the coming weeks to invalidate this Weekly Close below the 50 EMA and reclaim the EMA as support?” What Bitcoin On-Chain Data Says On-chain data sends a different signal. Analyst Frank (@FrankAFetter) shared Checkonchain’s Short-Term Holder MVRV chart , which tracks the profitability of recent buyers relative to their cost basis with standard-deviation bands. Bitcoin’s latest flush has driven the metric to the lower, negative-one-standard-deviation band, a zone previously tagged near $49,000 and $74,000 before meaningful bounces. Frank’s approach is straightforward: “I’m a buyer of standard deviation moves to the downside; they don’t come often, but they tend to be excellent opportunities.” Is The CryptoQuant CEO Right Again? CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju focuses on who is selling this dip. He characterizes the move as internal rotation among long-term players rather than broad distribution: “This dip is just long-term holders rotating among themselves. Old Bitcoiners are selling to tradfi players, who will also hold for the long run.” He recalls that his earlier top call was driven by “OG whales … dumping hard,” but argues that the landscape has shifted: “ETFs, MSTR, and other new channels kept injecting fresh liquidity. Onchain inflows are still strong. This dip is basically OG whales dragging the market.” Looking ahead, he points to “ sovereign funds , pension funds, multi-asset funds, and corporate treasuries” as building even larger, persistent liquidity channels and concludes: “The cycle theory is dead until these liquidity channels stop running.” Notably, Ki Young Ju correctly predicted in March this year that Bitcoin could see a “6–12 months of bearish or sideways price action.” In short, the technical picture has clearly weakened, with the 50-week EMA and the $96,000–$97,000 monthly Fibonacci zone now acting as critical lines in the sand. If Bitcoin can reclaim the weekly EMA and secure a monthly close above that 0.618 retracement, the case for this being a deep but standard consolidation remains credible. A sustained failure at these levels, by contrast, would lend significant weight to the bear-market argument. For now, the verdict hinges on how the next few weekly and monthly candles close, not on the intraday noise.

The filing said the conflict began when Broadcom told Fidelity it would end its access to the VMware tools after January 21, a move Fidelity said could shut down trading, block customers from their accounts, and break the systems its workers use each day. Fidelity said it filed the action because it believes Broadcom is ignoring a contract that came with VMware long before Broadcom bought the company. Fidelity challenges Broadcom over VMware access The lawsuit said VMware’s virtualization software has powered Fidelity’s virtual servers since 2005, and the company said it built most of its internal and customer-facing systems on top of that setup. Fidelity said the software became central to how it handles account access, trade execution, and everyday service for its nearly 50 million customers. Fidelity explained that this fight began in 2023 when Broadcom completed its purchase of VMware and changed the entire product lineup. The filing said Broadcom took the older VMware tools and rebuilt them into new bundles that cost far more than the separate products Fidelity used for years. Fidelity said that when it tried to renew its old subscription, Broadcom refused to honor the VMware contract. Fidelity said Broadcom pushed it to buy the new bundle instead of the tools it already used, which the company said would change its tech setup in a way that made no sense for its systems. Fidelity argued that losing access on the date Broadcom first gave, December 22, would have made it impossible to keep its platforms running. Fidelity’s filing said the company told the court it would need at least 18 to 24 months to move to a new setup because of how deeply VMware runs through its servers. The filing said Broadcom later agreed to extend the cutoff to January 21, giving the judge time to hear the case. Fidelity said this delay helps only for now, because the threat to its operations still stands if access ends.

This groundbreaking development marks a significant milestone for Solana investors and the broader crypto market. The SOL spot ETF represents a major step forward in institutional cryptocurrency adoption. What Makes the SOL Spot ETF So Important? The launch of a SOL spot ETF opens up new investment avenues for both retail and institutional investors. Unlike futures-based products, a spot ETF directly holds the underlying asset. This means investors gain actual exposure to Solana’s price movements without the complexities of managing private keys or navigating crypto exchanges. James Seyffart’s announcement carries substantial weight in the financial community. As a respected Bloomberg analyst, his insights often signal important market movements. The expected SOL spot ETF launch could trigger increased institutional interest in Solana and potentially influence its market position. How Will the SOLC ETF Benefit Investors? The introduction of this SOL spot ETF brings several advantages to the table. First, it provides regulatory clarity and institutional-grade security. Second, it offers easier access for traditional investors who prefer regulated financial products. Third, it could enhance Solana’s liquidity and market stability. Regulated access to Solana investments Enhanced security through established financial institutions Simplified trading on traditional stock exchanges Tax advantages for certain investment accounts What Challenges Might the SOL Spot ETF Face? Despite the excitement, potential challenges remain. Regulatory scrutiny continues to shape the crypto ETF landscape. Market volatility could affect early trading, and competition from other crypto ETFs might influence performance. However, the overall sentiment appears positive given the growing acceptance of cryptocurrency investment products. The timing of this SOL spot ETF launch coincides with increasing institutional interest in alternative cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. This development could position Solana as a more mainstream investment option and potentially drive broader adoption of the Solana blockchain ecosystem. Why Should You Pay Attention to This Launch? Tomorrow’s expected SOL spot ETF launch represents more than just another financial product. It signals growing institutional confidence in Solana’s technology and long-term potential. For investors, this could mean new opportunities to diversify crypto portfolios through regulated channels. The success of previous cryptocurrency ETFs suggests strong demand for such products. If the SOL spot ETF follows similar patterns, it could attract significant investment flows and potentially influence Solana’s price discovery mechanism. This makes tomorrow’s launch a crucial event for crypto market watchers. Final Thoughts on the SOL Spot ETF Opportunity The anticipated launch of Canary’s SOL spot ETF tomorrow marks a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency adoption. It bridges the gap between traditional finance and digital assets while providing investors with regulated exposure to Solana’s growth potential. As the crypto landscape continues evolving, such developments demonstrate the increasing maturity and institutional acceptance of blockchain technologies. Frequently Asked Questions What is a SOL spot ETF? A SOL spot ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Solana tokens, allowing investors to gain exposure to SOL’s price movements without owning the cryptocurrency directly. When will the SOLC ETF be available for trading? According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, the SOL spot ETF is expected to launch tomorrow, though exact trading times may vary by brokerage platform. How does a spot ETF differ from a futures ETF? A spot ETF holds the actual underlying asset (SOL tokens), while a futures ETF holds contracts that derive their value from future price expectations of the asset.

54550504,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=863011,1763431552,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54550504.jpeg,Crypto firm LevelField wins regulatory nod to acquire Burling Bank,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/levelfield-to-acquire-burling-bank/,"LevelField Financial, a digital-asset fintech company, got conditional approval from the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) to acquire Chicago’s Burling Bank, according to the company’s announcement on Monday. If approved, the deal would transform Burling Bank into LevelField Bank, a fully FDIC-insured banking service offering both traditional and crypto-integrated banking services in all U.S. states and territories. Gene A. Grant II, CEO of LevelField Financial, stated that obtaining approval marked a significant milestone for LevelField and represented a crucial step in introducing crypto services to regulated banking. He also stated that the company remains committed to stringent supervisory standards while increasing access to digital assets for users and companies. Despite receiving approval from the Illinois regulator, the fintech company is still waiting for confirmation from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to become a bank holding company. After the last step is completed, LevelField Bank can fully operate in accordance with federal banking rules, while also introducing digital assets into its products. Burling Bank is a relatively small commercial bank holding around $196 million in net assets and $158 million in customer deposits, according to Visbanking data. LevelField plans to utilize the bank’s foundation to develop a cutting-edge digital crypto-banking platform. LevelField plans 24/7 crypto banking LevelField Bank wants to integrate its traditional and digital assets into a single, 24/7 banking service. Soon enough, customers could eventually gain access to Bitcoin-backed loans , credit, and debit cards that reward users with Bitcoin, as well as services such as digital-asset trading and custody. In particular, the bank will focus on underbanked industries, including small businesses and sectors with limited access to conventional banking services. Grant II stated that all services will be underpinned by U.S. banking rules, providing a level of both security and legal oversight not available to many standalone crypto companies. LevelField has some analysts seeing its shift as a step toward American bank governance and the possibility that it will be the first fully regulated, FDIC-insured, chartered bank in the U.S. to introduce cryptographic services nationwide. It also follows a pattern set by many fintechs to bridge the gap between digital assets and mainstream financial institutions. LevelField pushes forward after the previous withdrawal LevelField first applied to acquire Burling Bank in February 2023 but withdrew its application in February 2024. The company submitted a second application in December 2024, which has now received conditional approval. Industry analysts said that the regulatory approval heralds a change in the rules governing crypto banking. Previous crypto-friendly banks, such as Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank , and Signature Bank, which had all gone bankrupt earlier this year, had prompted regulators to adopt a cautious approach to crypto adoption. LevelField’s methodical style of working — and its compliance with supervisory processes — may have given regulators some peace of mind that it is capable of connecting crypto and conventional banking safely. That purchase puts LevelField at the intersection of traditional finance and crypto innovation. And it’s a world where digital assets can exist alongside insured banks, thereby facilitating the greater adoption of cryptocurrencies. The sale is also indicative of broader market concerns. U.S. banking groups have warned that widespread investment in yield-bearing stablecoins could wipe out deposits from conventional banks and might ultimately take $6.6 trillion from the banking system, according to U.S. Treasury estimates as of April 2025. LevelField may offer a safer product to anyone who wants exposure to other digital assets and keeps funds within the insured banking chain.

The meme coin has rebounded sharply from a heavy-volume flush over the weekend while Shiba Inu broke key support before staging an aggressive intraday reversal. Despite broad risk-off sentiment with FUD surrounding the U.S. macro narrative, Dogecoin reinforced a key support trendline with a bounce from $0.155. The difference is smart money. DOGE has seen an uptick in institutional interest with ETF speculation, reflected by two weeks of heavy whale positioning. 4.72 billion Dogecoin $DOGE bought by whales in the last two weeks! pic.twitter.com/9XGweARtBj — Ali (@ali_charts) November 12, 2025 Whales’ move to retake positions after weeks of downside could be a testament to a potential bottom and the turning point for the next bull run, starting with Dogecoin. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Next Bull Market Starts Now? The bounce represents the start of a potential launchpad move, forming a potential double bottom reversal alongside the previous bounce around $0.155 at the start of the month. DOGE / USD 1-day chart, double bottom fuels ascending channel pattern. Source: TradingView. This support trendline contributes to a wider ascending channel and a potential breakout setup as momentum indicators find their footing. The RSI has formed a higher low after a bounce from oversold conditions at 30, while the MACD currently oscillates closely around the signal line. While FUD prevails, bullish momentum is building. A fully realized double bottom could flip a past resistance into support at $0.20, creating a higher and stronger footing for a breakout push. Once completed, a channel breakout opens the door for a 215% push to past highs around $0.50. But with Bitwise and Greyscale spot DOGE ETFs expected before year-end, fresh TradFi exposure could fuel a 525% push to $1 running into 2026. Still, with momentum indicators still weighed down by broader market FUD, a breakdown remains credible. The next price floor sits around $0.09—a 40% decline. Maxi Doge: A Better Bet Than DOGE And SHIB? Meme coin rotations are as consistent as they are powerful. When one market leader hits a ceiling, capital naturally flows to the next high-upside contender. Every bull run eventually delivers a new parabolic Doge-themed runner. Shiba Inu carried the torch from Dogecoin in 2021, then Floki, Bonk, Dogwifhat, and most recently, Neiro. That dynamic could now be playing out with Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , an early Doge-themed token gaining traction just as SHIB and DOGE grapple with liquidity issues. The hype is already translating into numbers. The $MAXI presale has almost $4.1 million , while early backers are earning up to 76% APY through staking rewards. For those who missed out on Doge waves before, MaxiDoge could represent the next chance to catch a meme coin breakout before it takes off.

In a message to users on Monday, founders Skirmantas Januskas and Dunica Dragos said they will begin winding down the site and associated services in the coming days, including the tracking of blockchains and decentralized applications. They added that details about the DAO and the RADAR token will follow in community channels, with decisions still to be made and the community invited to take part in that process.

The team said its goal was to make a chaotic sector more understandable and trustworthy, and that they leave confident they were a net positive to the space. Launched in 2018, the platform became known as the World’s Dapp Store, covering more than 90 blockchains and surfacing near real-time metrics on users, transactions and volume across DeFi, NFTs, gaming and metaverse projects. Beyond rankings and dashboards, DappRadar offered portfolio tools for tokens and NFTs, discovery features such as quests and airdrops, and research content that developers, investors and academics cited across multiple languages. The founders said they worked with hundreds of blockchains and thousands of projects over seven years, as DappRadar data fed newsrooms, research papers and market analyses worldwide. Tougher Market Cycles Made Analytics Models Harder To Sustain Funding helped fuel that growth. DappRadar raised about $7.33m across two rounds, including a $5m Series A in May 2021 led by Prosus Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners, with participation from Mastercard Lighthouse, BaltCap, Blockchain Ventures, JBIC IG Partners and NordicNinja VC. Those funds went toward expanding data coverage and product features during a period when crypto adoption and speculation surged, drawing more users to dapps and to the platform’s rankings. Market conditions later turned tougher for analytics businesses tied to activity cycles, squeezing revenues and stretching costs. The founders said the decision to close was difficult, but necessary. They thanked the community, partners and investors for trust and patience, and urged others to continue building tools for decentralized application discovery. With the shutdown, one of Web3’s most recognizable data hubs exits the stage, leaving a gap for rivals and new entrants to fill as the industry searches for durable business models.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $90,957.88 on the Binance USDT market, marking a concerning downturn for investors and traders alike. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Price Decline? Market analysts point to several factors influencing the current Bitcoin price movement. The cryptocurrency market often experiences volatility, and today’s drop reflects broader market sentiment. However, it’s crucial to understand that price fluctuations are normal in the crypto space, even for established assets like Bitcoin. Several key elements typically affect Bitcoin price movements: Market sentiment and investor psychology Global economic conditions Regulatory developments Trading volume and liquidity Institutional investor activity How Significant is This Bitcoin Price Drop? While any decline in Bitcoin price below key psychological levels attracts attention, context matters. The current Bitcoin price movement represents a normal market correction rather than a catastrophic event. Historical data shows that Bitcoin has experienced numerous similar corrections throughout its history, often followed by recovery periods. However, the drop below $91,000 does indicate increased selling pressure. Traders should monitor these key levels: Immediate support: $90,000 level Resistance: $92,500-$93,000 range Critical level: $88,000 support zone What Should Investors Do About the Bitcoin Price Movement? For long-term investors, short-term Bitcoin price fluctuations shouldn’t trigger panic decisions. The fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin remains unchanged. However, traders might consider these strategies: Dollar-cost averaging during dips Setting stop-loss orders for risk management Monitoring trading volume for confirmation Watching for potential buying opportunities Is This Bitcoin Price Drop a Buying Opportunity? Many experienced traders view price corrections as potential entry points. The current Bitcoin price below $91,000 might attract buyers who missed previous opportunities. However, always conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance before making investment decisions. Remember these important principles when evaluating the Bitcoin price: Never invest more than you can afford to lose Diversify your cryptocurrency portfolio Consider both technical and fundamental analysis Maintain a long-term perspective Conclusion: Navigating the Volatile Bitcoin Price Landscape The Bitcoin price movement below $91,000 serves as a reminder of cryptocurrency market volatility. While concerning for short-term traders, long-term investors understand that such fluctuations are part of Bitcoin’s maturation process. The key is maintaining perspective, managing risk appropriately, and making informed decisions based on comprehensive analysis rather than emotional reactions to price movements. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin price drop below $91,000? The Bitcoin price decline likely results from combined factors including market sentiment shifts, profit-taking by traders, and broader economic conditions affecting cryptocurrency markets. How low could Bitcoin price go? While predictions vary, key support levels to watch include $90,000 and $88,000. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and unpredictable. Should I sell my Bitcoin now? Investment decisions should align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Many investors use dollar-cost averaging strategies during price dips rather than making emotional decisions. When will Bitcoin price recover? Market recovery timelines are uncertain. Historical patterns show Bitcoin has recovered from previous corrections, but past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Some traders view price dips as buying opportunities, but always conduct thorough research and consider your investment strategy before purchasing cryptocurrency. What factors affect Bitcoin price most? Key factors include market sentiment, regulatory news, institutional adoption, trading volume, macroeconomic conditions, and technological developments.

Here’s what followed this signal in the past. Bitcoin SSR RSI Is Giving A Buy Signal In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) for Bitcoin. The SSR is an indicator that measures how the market cap of BTC compares against the total supply of the stablecoins. Stablecoins refer to cryptocurrencies that are pegged to a fiat currency. Investors generally park their capital in the form of these assets when they want to avoid the volatility associated with BTC and other assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Social Dominance Hits 4-Month High: What It Means Such holders also usually eventually invest back into Bitcoin and company, however, exchanging away their stablecoins in favor of them once they feel the time is right. Because of this reason, the stablecoin supply is often looked at as a sort of “available buy supply” in the cryptocurrency sector. When the value of SSR is high, it means BTC’s value is high compared to the stablecoin supply. Such a trend suggests the market stablecoin buying power is low, which could be a bearish sign. On the other hand, the indicator being low implies the sector may have a high amount of dry powder available relative to the Bitcoin market cap, which can naturally be bullish. Now, here is the chart for the BTC SSR shared by the analyst that shows the trend in its Relative Strength Index (RSI) over the last couple of years: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin SSR RSI has witnessed a decline recently as the BTC spot price has crashed. This suggests that there may be a high amount of stablecoin buying power available in the market now. The indicator’s drop has been so steep that it has entered into a zone that Maartunn has flagged as pertaining to a buy signal. From the chart, it’s apparent that past instances of this signal have often coincided with some sort of bottom or led into a price surge. In a lot of the instances, however, the signal has only resulted in a temporary reversal. It now remains to be seen whether any bullish shift will follow the latest signal, and if one does, whether it will be lasting.

Movement from dormant hands is often a sign of selling. BTC Price Bearish momentum hasn’t shown any signs of stopping for Bitcoin as its price has now dropped to the $92,500 level.

54553529,629035,1763434849,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54553529.jpeg,Bitcoin Maintains 9% Edge Over ETF Realized Price Despite Market Pressure – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-maintain-etf-realized-price-market-pressure/,"Bitcoin is struggling to hold above the $95,000 level as fear spreads across the market, with traders uncertain whether the recent correction marks the beginning of a broader downtrend or just a temporary shakeout. The leading cryptocurrency has been under sustained selling pressure, wiping out months of bullish momentum and pushing sentiment toward extreme caution. Analysts remain divided on the next move. Some argue that Bitcoin could be entering the early stages of a bear market, pointing to weakening momentum and growing short-term losses among holders. Others, however, believe that this consolidation phase is setting the stage for a major recovery, with potential for a surge beyond all-time highs once market sentiment stabilizes. Despite the volatility, on-chain data offers a glimmer of strength . Bitcoin is still trading above the ETF Realized Price, according to CryptoQuant. This means that, on average, ETF investors remain in profit — a sign that institutional demand remains resilient even amid retail fear. ETF Investors Remain in Profit Despite Market Fear According to top analyst Maartunn, Bitcoin’s ETF Realized Price — the average cost basis of all spot Bitcoin ETF holders — currently stands at $86,680. Despite the recent wave of volatility and fear-driven selling, Bitcoin is still trading roughly 9% above this critical level, suggesting that most ETF investors remain in profit. This metric serves as an important gauge of institutional sentiment. The fact that Bitcoin continues to trade above ETF investors’ cost basis indicates that institutional demand remains resilient, even as retail sentiment turns bearish. Historically, when Bitcoin holds above key realized price levels during corrections, it signals underlying strength and reduces the likelihood of a prolonged bear phase. Moreover, ETF inflows have remained stable, showing that long-term holders are not panic-selling despite price weakness. These investors tend to view market dips as opportunities to accumulate rather than liquidate positions — a stark contrast to short-term traders who often react emotionally to volatility. If Bitcoin can sustain its position above the ETF Realized Price, it would reinforce this structural support and could serve as the launchpad for a recovery once broader market sentiment shifts from fear to cautious optimism. Bitcoin Finds Support Amid Heightened Market Fear The weekly Bitcoin chart shows the cryptocurrency hovering just above $95,000, attempting to stabilize after weeks of consistent selling pressure. This marks the first time since May that BTC has revisited this zone, which now acts as a crucial support level both technically and psychologically. The decline from the recent highs near $120,000 has been sharp, reflecting a shift in sentiment as fear and uncertainty dominate the market. The 50-week moving average currently sits near $94,000, and Bitcoin’s ability to remain above it could define the next market phase. Historically, this moving average has been a reliable support line during mid-cycle corrections, often signaling accumulation zones rather than the start of prolonged bear markets. Meanwhile, the 200-week moving average — a long-term structural floor — remains far below near $70,000, highlighting that Bitcoin’s macro trend remains intact. Volume data also suggests a potential capitulation phase, with recent sell pressure accompanied by rising trading activity, indicating stronger hands may be absorbing weak supply. If Bitcoin holds this range, a rebound toward $100,000–$105,000 could follow. However, losing $95K would expose the market to further downside, potentially testing lower supports before stability returns.

The past 24 hours delivered a brutal wake-up call for traders, with over $600 million evaporating from the market. This dramatic sell-off primarily targeted long positions, revealing critical insights about current market sentiment and risk exposure. What Do These Crypto Futures Liquidations Reveal? The recent crypto futures liquidations data paints a clear picture of market direction. Forced closures hit long positions disproportionately hard, indicating strong selling pressure across major cryptocurrencies. This pattern suggests traders were caught off-guard by sudden price movements. Let’s examine the breakdown by asset: Bitcoin (BTC) : $412 million liquidated with 62.65% being long positions Ethereum (ETH) : $148 million liquidated with 75.66% being long positions Solana (SOL) : $43.44 million liquidated with 83.58% being long positions Why Are Long Positions More Vulnerable to Crypto Futures Liquidations? Long positions face higher risk during sudden market downturns because traders use leverage to amplify their bets. When prices drop rapidly, margin calls trigger automatic liquidations. The current crypto futures liquidations wave demonstrates how leveraged long positions can quickly turn problematic. Several factors contributed to this situation: Over-leveraged positions seeking maximum returns Unexpected market volatility catching traders off-guard Cascading effect as initial liquidations trigger more sell-offs How Can Traders Navigate Future Crypto Futures Liquidations? Understanding crypto futures liquidations patterns helps traders develop better risk management strategies. The current data shows that SOL positions suffered the highest percentage of long liquidations, suggesting particular vulnerability in altcoin markets. Protective measures include: Setting appropriate stop-loss orders Monitoring leverage ratios carefully Diversifying across different time frames and assets What Do These Crypto Futures Liquidations Mean for Market Recovery? Major crypto futures liquidations often signal potential market turning points. While painful for affected traders, large-scale position closures can remove excess leverage from the system. This creates healthier conditions for future price movements. The market typically experiences: Reduced speculative pressure after large liquidations More stable price discovery mechanisms Opportunities for new positions at better valuations Conclusion: Learning from Crypto Futures Liquidations Data The recent crypto futures liquidations serve as a powerful reminder about market risks. While the numbers appear staggering, they represent valuable lessons about position sizing, risk management, and market timing. Smart traders will use this data to refine their strategies rather than abandon futures trading altogether. Frequently Asked Questions What triggers crypto futures liquidations? Liquidations occur when a trader’s position loses enough value that their margin can no longer support it. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses. Why were long positions hit harder in recent liquidations? Long positions suffered more because the market moved downward rapidly. Traders betting on price increases faced margin calls as values dropped below critical levels. How can I avoid getting liquidated in crypto futures? Use proper risk management including reasonable leverage, stop-loss orders, and adequate margin buffers. Never risk more than you can afford to lose. Do large liquidations indicate market bottom or top? Massive liquidations often signal extreme sentiment and can mark turning points, though timing exact bottoms or tops remains challenging. Which cryptocurrency saw the highest percentage of long liquidations? Solana experienced the highest rate at 83.58% of liquidations coming from long positions, indicating particularly bullish sentiment that turned problematic.

This massive wave of forced position closures highlights the extreme volatility currently gripping digital asset markets and serves as a stark reminder of the risks involved in leveraged trading. What Exactly Are Futures Liquidated? When traders use leverage to open positions larger than their actual capital, exchanges require them to maintain a minimum margin level. If the market moves against their position and their collateral drops below this threshold, the exchange automatically closes their position to prevent further losses. This process is called liquidation, and it just happened on a massive scale. Why Did $115 Million in Futures Get Liquidated? The sudden market movement that triggered these futures liquidated events appears to be driven by several factors: Unexpected regulatory news affecting market sentiment Large whale movements creating selling pressure Cascading liquidations amplifying the initial price drop Overall market uncertainty in current conditions When the first wave of futures liquidated positions hit the market, it created a domino effect. Each forced sale pushed prices lower, triggering more margin calls and additional liquidations in a vicious cycle that wiped out $115 million in just sixty minutes. How Can You Avoid Getting Caught in Futures Liquidated Waves? Protecting yourself from becoming another statistic in these futures liquidated reports requires careful risk management. Consider these essential strategies: Use lower leverage ratios to withstand market volatility Set stop-loss orders at reasonable levels Monitor your margin levels regularly Avoid trading during high-volatility periods Diversify your trading strategies The $878 million in futures liquidated over the past 24 hours demonstrates how quickly conditions can change in cryptocurrency markets. Many traders who felt confident in their positions just hours ago now find their accounts significantly depleted or completely wiped out. What Does This Mean for the Broader Market? When we see massive amounts of futures liquidated in such short timeframes, it often signals a market reset. These events can create buying opportunities for patient investors, but they also indicate heightened uncertainty and potential for continued volatility. The psychological impact of watching $115 million in futures liquidated cannot be underestimated. Such events often lead to reduced trading activity as participants become more cautious, which can result in lower liquidity and even sharper price movements in the future. Key Takeaways From the $115 Million Futures Liquidated Event This dramatic hour of trading teaches several crucial lessons. First, leverage remains a double-edged sword that can amplify both gains and losses. Second, market conditions can change instantly, catching even experienced traders off guard. Finally, proper risk management isn’t optional—it’s essential for survival in cryptocurrency markets. The scale of futures liquidated in this event serves as a powerful warning to all market participants about the dangers of over-leverage and the importance of maintaining healthy margin buffers. Frequently Asked Questions What causes futures to be liquidated? Futures get liquidated when a trader’s position moves against them and their collateral drops below the required maintenance margin level, forcing the exchange to close their position automatically. How can I check if my position is at risk of liquidation? Most exchanges provide real-time margin ratio indicators and liquidation price calculators. Monitor these closely and maintain a safety buffer above the minimum requirements. Are futures liquidations always bad for the market? While painful for affected traders, liquidations can help reset over-leveraged markets and create healthier trading conditions long-term by removing excessive speculation. What’s the difference between partial and full liquidation? Partial liquidation closes only enough of your position to restore margin requirements, while full liquidation closes your entire position when losses exceed available collateral. Can I recover funds after liquidation? Generally, no. Once a position is liquidated, the losses are permanent. Some exchanges offer insurance funds, but these typically cover only specific scenarios. Which cryptocurrencies saw the most liquidations? Bitcoin and Ethereum typically account for the majority of liquidations during market-wide moves, though altcoins can experience even more severe percentage losses.

The deal is made up of investment-grade notes that are to be issued in six parts, and they have maturities ranging from short-term to a 40-year bond, the longest portion, tightened to 0.85 percentage points above Treasuries. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley were reportedly tasked with managing the offering, and Amazon has revealed plans to use the proceeds, which topped initial estimates by $3 billion, for a variety of corporate purposes ranging from acquisitions and capital expenditures to share buybacks and the repayment of its maturing debts. The last time Amazon held a bond sale in the U.S. was in 2022, and at that time, despite the high interest rates, it raised $8.25 billion. The difference in the amounts raised between then and now can be traced to the more favorable environment the recent bond sale has benefited from, as well as heightened investor appetite for debt linked to AI operations. With the amount it was able to raise through this sale, Amazon will be able to accelerate its push into the AI sector without breaking the bank or straining its balance sheet. Big Tech ramps up AI investments Amazon’s bond offering is happening as more big tech firms rush to develop AI infrastructure. These big technology firms have been turning to debt sales worth tens of billions of dollars to fund their various ambitions. Last month, Meta Platforms announced what is being touted as its biggest bond sale of up to $30 billion, while cloud infrastructure and software maker Oracle is also reportedly looking to raise $15 billion in bond sales. Also, earlier this month, Google parent Alphabet Inc. sold $25 billion of debt in the U.S. and Europe, while Meta issued $30 billion of corporate bonds last month, the biggest such offering of the year, and Oracle Corp. raised $18 billion through high-grade notes in September. In total, the major tech firms, including Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet, are expected to spend $400 billion on AI infrastructure this year. Already, Amazon has leveled up its spending on AI, with its capital expenditure expected to cross into the $125 billion region this year and more the year after. It has announced a $38 billion deal with OpenAI, which is expected to give its cloud unit a nice boost as it struggles against Microsoft.

The structure mirrors past market tops, suggesting sellers may not be finished yet. As momentum fades and the 20-week EMA turns lower, traders are watching whether this level can hold, or if a deeper correction is just beginning. Singapore’s SGX to Launch Bitcoin and Ether Perpetual Futures Singapore Exchange (SGX) will launch Bitcoin and Ether perpetual futures on November 24, aiming to meet rising institutional demand for crypto exposure. The products, regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), allow accredited investors to trade BTC and ETH price movements without expiry dates, a structure already popular in global derivatives markets. This marks Singapore’s second perpetual futures rollout in 2025, following EDXM’s July launch, reinforcing the nation’s role as a regional digital asset hub. SGX said the initiative strengthens the bridge between crypto and traditional finance, while maintaining strict oversight to ensure compliance and investor protection.

Crypto ETPs Record $2 Billion in Outflows, Largest Drop Since February Cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) saw $2 billion in outflows last week, marking the largest weekly withdrawal since February, according to CoinShares. Outflows surged 71% from the previous week’s $1.17 billion, bringing total redemptions over the past three weeks to $3.2 billion. CoinShares’ head of research James Butterfill attributed the decline to selling by large crypto-native investors and monetary policy uncertainty, which has dampened risk appetite. As a result, total assets under management in crypto ETPs dropped from an October peak of $264 billion to $191 billion, a 27% decline. UPDATE: Digital asset ETPs recorded $2B in outflows last week, the largest since February. pic.twitter.com/H0EyJhPFGF — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) November 17, 2025 Regionally, the U.S. accounted for 97% of all outflows, while Germany stood out with $13.2 million in inflows, signaling selective European resilience. By asset, Bitcoin ETPs saw $1.4 billion in outflows, and Ether ETPs lost $700 million, while Solana and XRP products posted smaller declines. Despite the retreat, inflows into short-Bitcoin and diversified products indicate investors are rotating exposure rather than exiting the market entirely. Historically, such large-scale outflows have applied short-term pressure on Bitcoin’s price but tend to ease once policy clarity and market sentiment stabilize, paving the way for a potential long-term recovery. BTC Inc. Names Brandon Green as CEO Amid 140% Revenue Surge BTC Inc., the parent company of Bitcoin Magazine and the Bitcoin Conference, has appointed Brandon Green as its new CEO. Green, who joined the firm in 2017, has played a key role in expanding Bitcoin events to Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong, and Amsterdam. Former CEO David Bailey will remain as Chairman of the Board. The company reported strong financial performance for the first nine months of 2025, with revenue up 140% year-over-year to $61.9 million and EBITDA reaching $23 million. Global conference attendance also climbed 45%, while Bitcoin Magazine drew over 175 million monthly impressions, reflecting expanding global engagement. Looking ahead to 2026, BTC Inc. plans to accelerate international expansion and introduce new institutional-focused offerings. The company’s growth reinforces confidence in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem, as strong corporate performance and rising global participation often signal deeper market maturity and long-term optimism for BTC. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Bearish ABCD Pattern Targets $83,800 Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish as BTC/USD slid to around $90,000. Right now, BTC is completing a bearish ABCD pattern, extending its decline toward the $83,800 demand zone after losing key support at $99,000. The ABCD structure, where the AB and CD legs mirror in length and slope, signals that BTC may be nearing the final stage of its correction. On the weekly chart, the CD leg aligns with the 127.2% Fibonacci extension from the AB swing, while RSI near 37 shows oversold conditions without yet confirming divergence. The 20-week EMA has turned lower for the first time this year, underscoring fading momentum, though the widening gap from price hints at a possible rebound. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If buyers defend the $83,800 level, BTC could bounce toward $96,000–$99,000, where the broken trendline now acts as resistance. A bullish engulfing candle near support could mark the start of recovery, while a drop below $83,000 would risk deeper losses toward $74,500. This ABCD setup suggests Bitcoin may be approaching its final corrective leg before a potential relief rally. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana?

The current Bitcoin price movement reflects typical market correction patterns after extended growth periods. What Does This Bitcoin Price Movement Mean for Investors? For long-term holders, this Bitcoin price correction might represent a buying opportunity. However, short-term traders face increased volatility. Consider these key points: Support levels to watch include $88,000 and $85,000 Trading volume has increased significantly during the decline Market sentiment has shifted from bullish to cautious Historical patterns suggest potential recovery within weeks The current Bitcoin price action demonstrates why risk management remains crucial in cryptocurrency investing.

Speaking from the White House, he told reporters the checks would go to middle- and moderate-income individuals, just months before critical midterm elections. According to Axios , this is the first time Trump has attached an actual timeframe to the plan, which until now had been more slogan than policy. He said the money would come from tariff revenues, calling it a “dividend” for citizens who’ve carried the weight of global trade. But for the payments to happen, Congress has to pass new legislation, and it’s not at all clear if that’s even on lawmakers’ radar. Bessent confirms the plan needs legislation, offers no clarity on delivery Scott Bessent, who runs the Treasury, said over the weekend that the administration can’t distribute any stimulus without Congress acting first. He made that clear during an interview on Fox News, saying, “We need legislation.” When asked if the checks were guaranteed, Scott shrugged it off: “We will see.” He also hinted that the money might not come as paper checks at all; maybe tax rebates, maybe something else. It’s still being worked out. Trump, for his part, kept things vague. “We’re going to be issuing dividends later on, somewhere prior to, you know, probably the middle of next year, a little bit later than that,” he said. He estimated the amount would be “thousands of dollars” but didn’t give more details. There was no word on how the eligibility would be determined, how the funds would be transferred, or how they’d prevent fraud, just that it’s coming. But pulling it off won’t be cheap.If the payout goes to individuals instead of households, and only targets middle- and low-income Americans, the total cost could top $200 billion. That’s more than what tariffs brought in during 2025, and about half of what’s projected for 2026. The numbers are huge, and the math doesn’t exactly balance out. Legal fight over tariffs adds more pressure to the plan’s future A separate fight could wreck the whole idea before it starts. The Supreme Court is set to rule in the coming months on whether many of Trump’s tariffs are even legal. If he loses, he says it could cost the country $3 trillion in refunds and lost business, a number critics say is exaggerated but still serious enough to scare lawmakers off any new spending tied to tariffs. Even with that legal cloud hanging, Trump continues to pitch tariffs as the centerpiece of his economic agenda. He claims they protect American jobs, force trade partners to play fair, and bring in revenue without raising taxes. And now, he says, they’ll bankroll direct payments to Americans. It’s part of a broader “affordability” push by Republicans trying to win back momentum after Democrats swept major elections earlier this month. Trump also said Friday that he’s open to cutting tariffs on things like beef, coffee, tropical fruits, and other commodities. That’s despite insisting tariffs don’t raise consumer prices. On Truth Social, he posted, “Affordability is a lie when used by the Dems. It is a complete CON JOB.” Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Compounding this uncertainty, a fresh sell signal has emerged from one of the cryptocurrency’s key indicators, reminiscent of the past when similar signals led to a staggering 67% drop in value. Bitcoin Price Could Plunge To $31,000 Market expert Ali Martinez pointed out in a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that the last time the SuperTrend indicator issued a sell signal for Bitcoin was in 2022. At that time, Bitcoin, which had reached an all-time high of $69,000, subsequently fell to around $17,000. Related Reading: Can Strategy Survive A 90% Bitcoin Crash? Saylor Says Yes While the market landscape has changed significantly since then—with the introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), new digital asset treasuries (DATs), and increased institutional support spurred by pro-crypto regulations—the current situation mirrors some of those past concerns. As it stands, the Bitcoin price is trading just above $94,500. If the historical trend of a 67% retracement were to repeat in the next months, the price could potentially fall to around $31,185, which could be the potential bottom of the new bear market. Adding to the conversation, another analyst known as Mr. Wall Street suggested that the recent Bitcoin price peak might be at $126,000. He forecasted that the next major downward move could see BTC hit levels between $74,000 and $82,000, ultimately reaching a target between $54,000 and $60,000 by the fourth quarter of 2026. This perspective contributes to the notion that Bitcoin is likely confirmed in a bear market, which could result in a year-long decline marked by price fluctuations similar to those seen in previous bear cycles. A New Death Cross Emerges Further complicating the outlook, analyst Doctor Profit pointed out a significant technical signal: the Bitcoin price experienced a death cross for the first time since April 2025. This event, marked by the 50-day moving average (MA) crossing below the 200-day moving average, historically led to rallies of 25% to 60% in the following three months. However, Doctor Profit emphasized a crucial difference this time around: the death cross occurred while Bitcoin was trading 6% below the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA50). In the previous instances, such crosses happened while Bitcoin was positioned above the EMA50, suggesting a different market sentiment this time. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Ethereum Price Is Crashing Again, Can It Breach $3,000? The current bearish sentiment is intensified by negative trends in ETF sales and whale net volume, adding significant pressure to the Bitcoin price. With the average entry price for Bitcoin buyers over the past six months set at approximately $94,600, falling back toward or below this level could trigger fresh selling pressure. Historically, short-term traders tend to exit at breakeven or even at a slight loss, raising concerns about further declines. Doctor Profit concluded his analysis stating: This combination of ETF selling, whale selling, and a large cluster of sellers sitting at breakeven levels is a dangerous setup and adds to the bearish case.

Aave Labs Introduces Savings-Style App According to a report from Fortune, this new product is designed to function similarly to a traditional savings account, but with higher yields than those offered by traditional finance banks. Users can earn a minimum interest rate of 5% on their deposits, which can be funded through bank accounts or debit cards. The app will utilize stablecoins alongside the Aave protocol to offer these financial services. Aave has established itself as a key player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto lending sectors, boasting over $3.23 trillion in cumulative deposits, nearly $1 trillion in total originated loan volume and $ billion in total interest paid, according to the platform’s website . While DeFi protocols often provide users with higher interest rates compared to conventional banking, they also carry heightened risks, such as the potential for hacks and the absence of government backing. However, Stani Kulechov, the founder and CEO of Aave Labs, assured users of the protocol’s safety. He pointed out that Aave has never encountered an exploit in its five-year history, emphasizing the dual layers of security related to both the market economics and the software code, which has been audited by multiple companies. Traditional Financial Giants Adopting Crypto The forthcoming launch of the Aave app arrives at a time when the gap between traditional financial institutions and crypto-native firms is closing. Major players like BlackRock are adopting Bitcoin (BTC) through the exchange-traded fund (ETF) sector. Stripe has integrated stablecoins into its offerings, and JPMorgan Chase has been actively developing blockchain solutions. In response, crypto firms are increasingly focusing on attracting mainstream customers. The US crypto exchange Kraken, for example, has newly introduced its own payments app, while various others are working to create bank-like products using stablecoins. Kulechov remarked, “Typically, DeFi has been accessible to very savvy, professional users. The next step for DeFi is to bring more direct access for consumers.” Kulechov, a figure in the DeFi movement since launching the protocol in 2020, has expanded the company’s offerings to include a crypto wallet, a decentralized stablecoin, and a protocol for social media. In October, the firm made headlines by acquiring the stablecoin company Stable Finance for an undisclosed amount. Kulechov noted that the acquisition also enhanced their consumer-focused experience, allowing the team to move more swiftly and improve their product offerings. While the broader crypto market continues its downtrend, the price of AAVE saw a 2% uptick following the announcement. At the time of writing, it was trading at $171.87 per token.

It was also the third consecutive week of negative flows, which pushed the combined total to $3.2 billion. CoinShares attributed the downturn to ongoing monetary policy uncertainty in addition to selling activity from major crypto whales. Falling prices have further weighed on the sector, causing the total assets under management in digital-asset ETPs to slide by almost 27% from their early-October peak of $264 billion to $191 billion. Digital Asset Exodus In the latest edition of the Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, CoinShares reported that Bitcoin was hit hardest by last week’s negative sentiment and recorded $1.38 billion in outflows, while extending its three-week streak and now accounting for 2% of total assets under management (AuM). At the same time, short Bitcoin products attracted $9.1 million in inflows over the past week, which indicates that some traders are positioning for further downside. Zooming out, these ETPs have seen $18.1 million in new inflows over the past three weeks. Ethereum performed even worse and witnessed $689 million in outflows, equal to 4% of its AuM. Solana and XRP also posted small outflows of $8.3 million and $15.5 million, respectively. On the other hand, Sui, Litecoin, and Cardano saw modest inflows of $6 million, $3.3 million, and $0.4 million. Multi-asset investment products also drew $31.2 million in new capital. In fact, cautious market conditions pushed investors toward these diversified products, which resulted in $69 million flowing into multi-asset ETPs over the past three weeks. Negative sentiment hit most regions, and was led overwhelmingly by the US, which recorded $1.97 billion in outflows, or 97% of the global total. Several other markets also saw similar outflows, including Switzerland with $39.9 million, Sweden with $1.3 million, and Hong Kong with $12.3 million. Canada and Australia followed suit with $9.8 million and $1.8 million in outflows. On the other hand, Germany stood out as the only major region to take advantage of the price pullback, while attracting $13.2 million in inflows. Brazil also bucked the trend and registered a more modest $2.4 million in new capital. Sentiment Cautious But Constructive Despite the current struggles , certain market experts believe that Bitcoin is in the later stages of its correction rather than entering a new downtrend. In a statement to CryptoPotato , Zilliqa’s Interim CEO Alexander Zahnd explained that the market twice rejected levels just below $100,000, which means that forced selling has mostly cleared, and buyers are quietly defending a key support zone. While it is too early to confirm a bottom, he said the market is stabilising. The exec added that recent bearish sentiment is being driven by ETF outflows, thinner liquidity, and a temporary pause in institutional allocation, none of which indicate a structural shift. Instead, investors are waiting for clearer macro signals after the Fed’s recent pause and US shutdown concerns. He described the overall sentiment as “cautious but constructive.” Zahnd went on to add, “Positioning has lightened, but we’re not seeing panic. The rotation into ecosystems like Solana shows that capital is still active, just more selective. This phase is about rebuilding pressure, not chasing momentum. If anything, the current environment favours gradual accumulation on support rather than trying to time dramatic moves. The next impulse will likely come once ETF flows stabilise or new institutional buyers step back in.” The post Bitcoin Bleeds $1.38B as Traders Rush Into Bearish Bets, Ethereum Hit Even Harder appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Ethereum|Solana|XRP,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-11-18 04:03:13

The price is now showing bearish signs and might extend losses if it dips below $2.120. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.250 zone. The price is now trading below $2.20 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.220 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below $2.120. XRP Price Dips Further XRP price attempted a recovery wave above $2.30 but failed to continue higher, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price started a fresh decline below $2.250 and $2.20. There was a move below the $2.150 support level. A low was formed at $2.105, and the price is now consolidating losses with a bearish angle below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.525 swing high to the $2.058 low. The price is now trading below $2.20 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.20 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.220 level. There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.220 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. A close above the trend line could send the price to $2.28. The next hurdle sits at $2.320 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.525 swing high to the $2.058 low. A clear move above the $2.320 resistance might send the price toward the $2.40 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.450 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.50. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $2.220 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.120 level. The next major support is near the $2.10 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.10 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.050. The next major support sits near the $2.020 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $1.880.

His recent statement on social media platform X has sent shockwaves through the crypto community, suggesting we’re approaching a pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Why This Might Be Your Last Chance to Buy Bitcoin Under $90K Cameron Winklevoss, one of the most influential figures in cryptocurrency, made a bold declaration that could change investment strategies worldwide.

The timing coincides with several key market developments: Increasing institutional investment Growing mainstream acceptance Upcoming Bitcoin halving event Global economic uncertainty driving digital asset demand What Makes the $90K Bitcoin Price Target Significant? Reaching $90K would represent a major psychological and technical breakthrough for Bitcoin. This price level has been identified by multiple analysts as a critical resistance point. Once breached, many experts predict accelerated growth toward six-figure valuations. Historical patterns show that Bitcoin often experiences rapid price appreciation after breaking through key resistance levels. The current market structure suggests we might be approaching such a breakout moment. Therefore, the opportunity to buy Bitcoin under $90K might indeed be limited. How Should Investors Approach This Bitcoin Prediction? While Winklevoss’s statement carries significant weight, experienced investors know that cryptocurrency markets remain volatile. However, several factors support his optimistic outlook about buying Bitcoin under $90K being a time-sensitive opportunity. Consider these market indicators: Growing institutional adoption Limited supply mechanics Increasing global recognition as digital gold Technical analysis showing strong upward momentum Understanding the Risks and Opportunities Every investment carries potential risks alongside opportunities. The chance to acquire Bitcoin under $90K comes with both. Market volatility means prices can fluctuate significantly, even with positive long-term trends.

Winklevoss’s warning about the final opportunity to buy Bitcoin under $90K deserves serious consideration from both new and experienced investors. While no prediction is guaranteed, the combination of technical, fundamental, and market sentiment factors suggests we’re approaching a significant price movement.

He stated on platform X that this is likely the last chance to purchase Bitcoin for under $90,000, based on current market analysis and adoption trends. How reliable are price predictions from crypto founders?

Key drivers include institutional adoption, ETF approvals, macroeconomic conditions, and the upcoming Bitcoin halving reducing new supply. Should beginners invest based on this prediction? New investors should research thoroughly, understand volatility risks, and only invest what they can afford to lose, regardless of predictions. What’s the time frame for this $90K prediction? Winklevoss didn’t specify an exact timeline, suggesting the current price window might close relatively soon based on market momentum. Are there alternatives if I miss buying Bitcoin under $90K?
