Szabo warned that while the layer one of a strong trust-minimized system can endure many kinds of interference, legal routes remain a meaningful vulnerability. He said financial rules are one set of risks the ecosystem has learned to handle, helped by developers and an expanding legal profession focused on crypto , but that laws tied to arbitrary data create a much wider and less predictable attack surface. Trust Minimized Not Trustless Szabo told readers that the technical design reduces the need to trust single parties, yet it does not eliminate the need for trust entirely. According to his view, losing the phrase “trustless” and using “trust-minimized” is important because it points to real limits. Developers must keep the protocol informed by careful choices. Anarcho-capitalism is a wonderfully abstract ideal that can inspire innovation. It helped inspire me to help invent cryptocurrency. But real-world cryptocurrencies are not trustless — they are trust-minimized. Each cryptocurrency has a legal attack surface, representing the… — Nick Szabo (@NickSzabo4) November 16, 2025 Lawyers have become part of the defense too, he said, and that legal work has made financial law attacks manageable in many cases. The claim is not that Bitcoin is fragile; it is that the threats are not only technical — they are real, legal, and those threats change with new laws and court decisions. Regulators Face Practical Limits Not everyone agrees. One critic, Chris Seedor, who runs a Bitcoin seed storage company called Seedor, pushed back and called some legal fears “boogeymen.” Based on reports of his remarks, Seedor argued that states can try to use law to stop tools and protocols, but history shows limits. Respectfully, I think you’re giving too much weight to speculative legal boogeymen. Bitcoin’s resilience was never about predicting every possible domain of law – it was about minimizing technical points where coercion can bite. If regulators could shut down general-purpose data… — Coinjoined Chris (@coinjoined) November 16, 2025 He pointed to PGP and Tor as two technologies that have been unpopular with some regulators yet remain available. His point: when code lacks central points of control, courts and agencies have less practical leverage to fully shut it down. Arguments From Different Angles The debate is partly about emphasis. Szabo focuses on open legal questions and new kinds of laws that could be used to target content or arbitrary data placed on-chain. Seedor highlights how technical design can remove the lever points that make enforcement easy. Both are talking about the same problem from different directions: one looks at the legal map and sees many untested routes; the other looks at past enforcement and sees that states rarely win against widely distributed protocols.

The broader market has also been unstable, adding pressure to Dogecoin. Despite this stretch of bearish price action, a deeper look at the higher-timeframe chart shows a structure that has not been invalidated by the recent decline. This is where a technical analysis from XForceGlobal comes in, as he argues that Dogecoin is sitting inside an “insanely bullish” long-term formation that is unfolding beneath the surface. The 5-Wave Structure Behind Dogecoin’s Bullish Setup A detailed technical analysis shared by XForceGlobal on the social media platform X argues that Dogecoin is nearing the final stages of an Elliott Wave formation. His interpretation points to cycle targets well above $1 and frames the ongoing price action as part of a developing fifth impulse wave. Related Reading: Top Meme Coins Besides Dogecoin And Shiba Inu With Potential Still Seeing Major Interest The chart shared by XForceGlobal outlines an idealized Elliott Wave cycle that stretches back almost a decade. Dogecoin has already completed the first four major waves on the macro level. The technical analysis shows the fifth wave technically began months ago, with the fourth wave bottom forming sometime between late 2023 and early 2024. However, the prolonged pullbacks of the past few months introduce the possibility that the fourth wave may still be playing out, instead of the fifth wave. Despite the choppy price action, the analysis shows that the fourth wave low is protected, and the current price action is still the fifth wave. The chart also shows how Dogecoin has been distributing within a narrowing structure, but the lows have consistently held. Both of the scenarios visualized on Dogecoin’s price chart still lead to a new all-time high once the rally resumes for another strong push. Why The Next Dogecoin Wave Points Toward $1 XForceGlobal noted that “cycle targets are still $1+,” a projection supported by the geometry of the fifth wave. The structure resembles the same formations that highlighted Dogecoin’s massive expansions in earlier bull cycles, particularly in 2017 and 2021. Nonetheless, it’s important to note that there’s still room for more distribution. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Price “Historic Mega Run” – Here’s The Target The current resistance zones sit far below his projected fifth-wave target zone, and the broader market structure shows no violation of the wave-4 levels that must hold for the setup to still be valid. The chart highlights a potential path that first moves through the $0.33-$0.47 zone before clearing the psychological $0.50 threshold and finally breaking above its current all-time highs at $0.731 and further up into the $1 region. A full extension of the fifth wave from present levels implies a price target around $1.768. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1618.

Now, as that capitulation hits the tape, long-term cycle signals and on-chain bands line up to test how deep this reset can go. Retail Bitcoin Holders Dump 148K BTC as Price Breaks Below Key Cost Bases Retail-linked Bitcoin holders dumped about 148,241 BTC at a loss on Nov. 14 as the price slid below $100,000 and under several realized price bands, according to on-chain data from CryptoQuant. Holders Net Daily Change. Source: CryptoQuant The metrics show that wallets often associated with newer or smaller investors, grouped as holders with less than 1 million BTC, turned sharply net negative on the day. The selling hit while Bitcoin traded near $96,853, well below the group’s estimated cost basis between roughly $102,000 and $107,000. The move marked one of the largest single-day net outflows for these addresses in recent months. At the same time, realized price curves for younger UTXO age bands flipped above spot. The realized prices for coins held between one day and one week, one week and one month, and up to one year now stand higher than the market price. That structure indicates that many recent buyers are underwater, a condition that often coincides with heavier pressure from short-term holders. Bitcoin Realized Price UTXO Age Bands. Source: CryptoQuant/X The break of the $100,000 level added a psychological layer to the on-chain stress. Once spot fell through both the round-number mark and the realized ranges of recent entrants, selling accelerated as investors moved to cut losses. The outflow reflects a wave of capitulation from buyers who entered near the peak and chose to exit rather than face a deeper drawdown. Despite the pain for those sellers, the same data set shows that other market participants absorbed the coins. The transfer from short-term, loss-making holders to counterparties still willing to buy below $100,000 highlights a shift in ownership as Bitcoin tests new support levels after the flush. Bitcoin Tests Cycle Markers as Price Falls Below Key Bands Bitcoin is moving through levels that previously marked the end of major market cycles, according to new chart data shared by Mister Crypto and Glassnode analyst Ali. As price trades under $98,650, both long-term technical patterns and MVRV deviation bands highlight support zones that historically defined cyclical bottoms. Mister Crypto’s visual comparison shows the same signal repeating at the close of the 2014, 2017, and 2021 cycles: a monthly death cross between the 20-month and 50-month moving averages. Each occurrence aligned with a prolonged downturn before markets reset. The 2025 chart now shows the same cross forming again as Bitcoin pulls back from its recent peak, placing the current correction in line with prior cycle-end structures. Bitcoin Cycle Death Cross. Source: Mister Crypto At the same time, on-chain data from Glassnode shows price slipping below the mean MVRV deviation band at $98,650. Once that band breaks, the next statistically defined levels sit at $75,740, $56,160, and $52,820. Those ranges mark deeper points where market value historically reconnected with realized fundamentals during extended corrections.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the decline with a 1.2% drop, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite followed with losses of 0.90% and 0.84% respectively. This broad-based decline affected multiple sectors and raised questions about market stability. Why Did US Stock Indices Experience This Decline? Several factors contributed to the downward pressure on US stock indices during this trading session. Market analysts point to concerns about inflation data, potential interest rate changes, and global economic uncertainties. Moreover, sector-specific weaknesses in technology and industrial stocks amplified the overall market decline. The simultaneous drop across all three major US stock indices suggests systemic rather than isolated issues. Breaking Down the Numbers: How Each Index Performed Let’s examine the specific performance of each major US stock index: Dow Jones Industrial Average : Fell 1.2%, representing the largest decline among the three indices S&P 500 Index : Dropped 0.90%, affecting a broad range of large-cap companies Nasdaq Composite : Declined 0.84%, showing technology stocks weren’t immune to the sell-off This coordinated movement across US stock indices indicates widespread investor caution rather than sector-specific concerns. What Does This Mean for Your Investment Strategy? When US stock indices move in unison like this, it’s crucial to reassess your investment approach. Consider these key points: Diversification becomes even more important during market volatility Long-term investors might see this as a potential buying opportunity Monitor economic indicators that could signal future market direction The performance of US stock indices often reflects broader economic trends that can impact various asset classes. Historical Context: How Often Do All Three Indices Decline Together? While simultaneous declines across all three major US stock indices occur periodically, they typically signal significant market events. Historical data shows that such coordinated movements often precede periods of increased volatility. However, they can also represent healthy market corrections after extended rallies. Understanding these patterns helps investors make informed decisions about their portfolios. Key Takeaways from Today’s Market Movement The decline in US stock indices serves as an important reminder about market dynamics. First, even established indices experience fluctuations. Second, diversified portfolios help mitigate risk during such periods. Finally, staying informed about market conditions enables better decision-making. The movement of US stock indices provides valuable insights into investor sentiment and economic health. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the decline in US stock indices? The decline resulted from multiple factors including inflation concerns, interest rate expectations, and global economic uncertainties affecting investor confidence across US stock indices. Should I be worried about my investments? Market fluctuations are normal. Consult with a financial advisor about your specific situation, but remember that diversified portfolios typically weather such movements in US stock indices. How often do all three major indices decline together? While not daily occurrences, simultaneous declines across major US stock indices happen several times per year and reflect broader market sentiment shifts. Will this affect cryptocurrency markets? Traditional market movements in US stock indices can influence cryptocurrency markets as investors often view different asset classes as correlated during risk-off periods. What sectors were most affected? The decline was broad-based, though technology and industrial sectors showed particular weakness across the major US stock indices. Is this a good time to buy stocks? Market declines can present opportunities, but timing the market is challenging. Consider your investment horizon and risk tolerance when US stock indices experience volatility.

The influential Fed official, often mentioned as a potential successor to Chair Jerome Powell, declared he would have ended the quantitative easing program much sooner. This revelation about Fed QE policy comes at a critical juncture for both traditional finance and digital assets. What Exactly Is Fed QE Policy and Why Does It Matter? Quantitative easing represents the Federal Reserve’s strategy of injecting massive liquidity into financial markets. The central bank purchases government bonds and other securities to stimulate economic activity. However, Governor Waller believes the Fed QE policy continued for too long, potentially fueling inflation and market distortions that affected everything from stocks to cryptocurrencies. The timing of these comments couldn’t be more significant. As the Fed navigates between controlling inflation and supporting economic growth, Waller’s perspective on Fed QE policy suggests a more hawkish approach might have been preferable. This stance directly impacts: Interest rate decisions Market liquidity conditions Cryptocurrency volatility patterns Investment strategy adjustments How Would Earlier Fed QE Policy Changes Have Affected Markets? Governor Waller’s position raises crucial questions about alternative economic scenarios. Had the Fed implemented his preferred Fed QE policy timeline, markets might have experienced: Reduced inflationary pressures could have emerged sooner, potentially moderating the aggressive interest rate hikes that rocked both traditional and crypto markets. The relationship between Fed QE policy and digital assets remains complex, but earlier tightening might have prevented some of the excess liquidity that flowed into speculative investments. What Does This Mean for Future Fed QE Policy Decisions? Waller’s comments provide valuable insight into future monetary policy directions. His perspective on Fed QE policy suggests that when the next economic downturn occurs, the Federal Reserve might be more cautious about deploying massive stimulus measures. This approach to Fed QE policy could mean: Shorter duration for future quantitative easing programs More rapid normalization of balance sheets Earlier interest rate adjustments during recovery periods Reduced market dependency on Fed support Why Should Crypto Investors Care About Fed QE Policy? The connection between Federal Reserve actions and cryptocurrency markets has strengthened significantly. Changes in Fed QE policy directly influence: Liquidity conditions across all financial markets, including digital assets. Investor risk appetite, which often drives capital flows into cryptocurrencies. Dollar strength, which inversely correlates with Bitcoin and other major crypto assets. Understanding these relationships helps crypto investors anticipate market movements and adjust their strategies accordingly. Key Takeaways from Waller’s Fed QE Policy Stance Governor Waller’s revelation provides crucial insights for market participants. His position on Fed QE policy indicates that internal Fed debates about stimulus duration were more intense than publicly known. The implications extend beyond traditional finance to affect digital asset valuations and market psychology. Moving forward, investors should monitor Fed communications for signals about how this perspective might influence future policy decisions. The evolution of Fed QE policy thinking could determine how the central bank responds to future economic challenges. Frequently Asked Questions What is quantitative easing? Quantitative easing is a monetary policy where central banks purchase government securities to inject money into the economy and stimulate growth. Why does Fed QE policy affect cryptocurrencies? QE increases market liquidity, which often flows into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, potentially driving prices higher. How long did the recent QE program last? The Fed’s pandemic-era QE program lasted approximately two years before beginning tapering in late 2021. What are the risks of extended QE programs? Prolonged QE can fuel inflation, create asset bubbles, and make markets dependent on central bank support. Could Waller become the next Fed Chair? While mentioned as a potential candidate, the decision depends on presidential appointment and Senate confirmation. How can investors prepare for QE policy changes? Monitor Fed communications, diversify portfolios, and understand how liquidity changes affect different asset classes. Found this analysis of Fed QE policy insights helpful?

The team made the announcement in a statement where they reflected on a mix of pride in what they were able to achieve as a platform and exhaustion from market pressures. The closure heralds the loss of a well-known provider of data, rankings, and insights for dapps across multiple blockchain networks. Why DappRadar is packing up According to what the founders shared on X on Monday, the shutdown is happening because running the platform as it is has become “financially unsustainable in the current environment,” and its tracking services, which covered blockchains and Dapps, will be taken offline in the coming days, as the shutdown begins. “After seven years, it’s time to say goodbye. We’ve made the difficult decision to shut down the DappRadar platform. Running a platform of this scale became financially unsustainable in the current environment, and after exploring every option, we had to make the difficult decision to wind things down,” the team wrote on X. According to the post, which has been viewed over 300,000 times, the platform plans to inform its users separately on what will happen to its native RADAR token and its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). It also revealed that there are decisions to be made regarding the token and the DAO and that it was interested in hearing from the community. Following the announcement, the token price took a nosedive of about 40% immediately, reaching as low as $0.00064, according to data from Nansen. DappRadar’s RADAR token is down more than 35% since the shutdown announcement. Source: CoinMarketCap For now, it is unclear what will come next for the team at DappRadar. However, in their announcement, they expressed hope that the mission to help people understand and better explore decentralized apps will not end with the shutdown and that someone will pick up where they’ve left off and “carry the torch forward.” The team believes DeFi is a core pillar of finance, and even though funding has been cooling and exploit-related losses have surged this year, there is space for more growth and recovery. DappRadar is not the only DeFi protocol to shut down recently The shutdown of DappRadar is a big blow to the DeFi space; the platform had aggregated crucial metrics that helped users avoid rugs and stay ahead of the bots as they analyzed Web3 projects. Still, its shutdown is not an isolated case in the DeFi sector and comes on the heels of a broader wave of Web3 shutdowns this year, which has affected exchanges like eXch, NFT marketplaces like X2Y2, and DeFi protocols like Mango Markets. eXch was privacy-focused and famous for encouraging anonymous trading, but it announced permanent closure in May of 2025 amid intense regulatory scrutiny. The platform first opened shop in 2021 and handled millions in volume before it came under fire for helping hackers launder billions in the February hack that targeted Bybit, an ordeal it could not recover from. As far as NFT marketplaces go, X2Y2 was one of the most popular; founded in 2022 pseudonomously, it stood out with its low fees and royalty enforcement tools and was even touted as a threat to Opensea at some point, with its $5.6B in all-time volume. Unfortunately, that was when the NFT sector was on the up and up. It has been in a bear market for a long time now, and X2Y2 has not fared well. Mango Markets used to be a hot venue for DeFi lending and perps trading on Solana, but it fully shut down in January of this year, following a unanimous governance approval that felt inevitable after the exploit that rocked the protocol in October 2022. These are only some of the notable platforms in crypto that have shut down this year; there are many more, and a lot come from the gaming sector, which is currently suffering as VC funds are busy chasing shiny new things like the AI sector.

Tom Lee stated that Ethereum is in a “supercycle” and that he maintains his bullish outlook in the long term despite technical corrections. According to Lee, the biggest driver keeping Ethereum's core story intact is the projects built on its blockchain, particularly the massive developments in asset tokenization. Financial institutions, including Wall Street's leading figure, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, are exploring bringing traditional assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate to the blockchain. He noted that this process will require a neutral blockchain with 100% uptime, and that Ethereum is the most suitable candidate for this role. The analyst argues that despite the cryptocurrency's high volatility, the fundamental narrative is solid and that institutional interest will support Ethereum. Related News: Watch Out: Significant Selling Preparation May Be Underway in This Altcoin, On-Chain Data Reveals - It's Largest Institutional Holder While assessing the likelihood of Ethereum's price bottoming this week, the analyst highlighted the ratio of the value of all assets locked on its blockchain to its market capitalization. He noted that historically, Ethereum has bottomed at levels around 50%, and that the current situation is quite close to that level, increasing the likelihood of a bottom. He also argued that Ethereum is undervalued relative to Bitcoin (ETH/BTC). He added that he calculated that if Ethereum's price-to-BTC ratio were to reach its long-term (8-year) average, the ETH price could reach around $12,000, suggesting that Ethereum is currently undervalued. *This is not investment advice.

Inside the Presale Investors Think Could Deliver 20–50x Returns,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/11/dogecoin-price-prediction-doge-at-016-or-ev2-at-0015-inside-the-presale-investors-think-could-deliver-20-50x-returns,"Choosing between DOGE and EV2 feels like one of those decisions that can tie your brain in knots, especially now that the EV2 presale is heating up and drawing in buyers who believe it could turn pennies into fortunes with 20x to 50x returns if the stars align. Prices keep dancing to their own tune, sentiment keeps changing, and investors keep grabbing at anything that looks like a golden ticket DOGE still commands attention because of its loyal crowd, but interest drifts the moment a newer project whispers a stronger narrative. Currently, One EV2 token is priced at $0.01, with the next presale stage set at $0.025. On top of all that, the project rolled out a five hundred thousand dollar reward pool which gives early buyers even more to chew on. DOGE Market Outlook: Strong Volume With Strings Attached Dogecoin sits at $0.16 and the numbers paint a lively picture. Trading volume keeps roaring past $2 billion and the market cap sits comfortably above $24 billion. Liquidity is never a problem with DOGE and that alone keeps people circling around it. Still, the cracks show when you look closer. DOGE’s supply keeps growing without any ceiling in sight, which makes long term value feel like a slippery fish. Most of its big moves come when social media gets loud or when the market mood swings upward. That kind of rhythm means many buyers are riding the wave instead of following solid updates. It is true that DOGE still has charm and cultural weight, but the ecosystem itself has not changed in any meaningful way. When the hype cools, the price often follows suit. So DOGE ends up being one of those assets where you either catch the wind or get pushed back by it. EV2 Presale Momentum Shows A Project With A Clearer Path EV2 Presale is taking things into hands by being affordable and accessible. Right now, More than 43 million tokens have already left and the total raise has crossed $430,000. The game positions itself as a fast moving looter shooter that mixes open world action with competitive clashes. EV2 leans into its simple PvX structure and lets players jump into PvE or PvP without feeling lost. Tokens and Holocrons work together in a way that feels straightforward, yet still rewarding for players who want their progress to mean something. Additionally, players in EV2 manage a 200-slot inventory that can be expanded using EV2 Tokens. Rare items and weapons may become NFTs, potentially tradable on Web3 marketplaces. The game also features a fully modular weapon system with deep crafting synergies Survivor Mode: A Fight Where Every Second Counts Survivor mode is where players enter a brutal last man standing scenario where hesitation can cost you everything. This mode turns up the pressure because the safe zone keeps shrinking and every corner becomes a roll of the dice. It hits that sweet spot where anyone can shine if they think fast enough The Pathfinder suit fits perfectly because its speed helps players slip out of danger and strike when rivals least expect it. Fracture Survival Match: Collect Fast Or Lose Even Faster Fracture drops a number of twenty five players into a frantic scramble for glowing cubes that decide everything. It fits the EV2 reward cycle since strong performances bring better loot and better momentum. The Brute suit invites a more forceful style where you take cubes by overpowering anyone in your path. Collecting two cubes of each color reveals a relic which instantly turns the entire match into a hunt with one target. DOGE or EV2: Following the Crowd or Betting on the Game-Changer? If the choice is DOGE at $0.16 or EV2 at $ 0.015, the real question becomes whether you want a coin that moves with the crowd or a token tied to an actual game with active development. It is clear that they appeal to different kinds of investors, but EV2 does bring a newer structure, clearer gameplay identity, and a presale where buyers genuinely believe a 20 to 50X outcome is not out of the question if the project sticks to its roadmap. EV2 steps forward with a cleaner story and an active presale that actually feels like it has both feet on the ground.

Analyst claims Tron’s stability, strong wallet activity and steady USDT flow continue to support a bullish outlook. The EV2 token presale is gaining traction fast and is drawing fresh interest from investors. While most altcoins spent last week absorbing heavy losses, Tron (TRX) remained in a tight range between $0.28 and $0.31, experiencing only a 1% drop. This stability has given traders strong optimism for the altcoin as we enter a new week. Tron's price action has further printed a clean inverse head and shoulders, pushing above a descending trendline that held for weeks. This backs the optimism for a stronger price reversal. But where will Tron end the year? Technical Breakout Structure Points to a Bullish Direction As of this writing, TRX is trading at $0.2940 per the 4-hour chart . This price action puts Tron’s price above a trendline that has capped every rally since late October. The price has also printed a clean inverse head and shoulders pattern. The left shoulder, the deeper head, and the right shoulder align without distortion, a pattern rare to find, especially in a choppy market. Breaking above the inverse head and shoulder pattern , puts the resistance zone directly in play. Since this setup is highly considered bullish, traders are waiting to see volume spike to get back in the move. A strong close above the resistance zone at $.03100, would spark fresh confidence supporting a stronger recovery. However, the long-term descending line still sits at $0.33 and could act as the next resistance. But nonetheless, short-term control has shifted to buyers. TRX forms a clean bullish Inverse Head and Shoulder Pattern with breakout already taking place | Source: TradingView Multichain Growth Reinforces the Case for Higher Targets TRON also exhibits strong fundamentals, giving the bullish technical outlook a firm base. For instance, Stablecoin activity remains dominant while the chain processes a significant volume of USDT stablecoin, rivaling other networks. Data by DefiLlama for instance shows the network recorded 1.72% stablecoin market cap change, reaching $79.336b. USDT dominates with 98.54% market share. The Avail Nexus upgrade is also changing the platform’s reach. TRON now functions as a liquidity passageway between multiple chains. Apps that once stayed within TRON’s walls can now scale outward with fewer barriers. Based on these metrics, TRX could rise to $0.80130 by 2026. Strong institutional flows, well-established stablecoin rails, and a multichain environment attracting both developers and users could serve as the potential drivers for such a rally. However, the short-term target sits at $0.31 with the next possible level at $0.33. EV2 Presale Draws Heavy Early Attention Investors seeking early-stage upside are also moving toward presales with stronger narratives. Amongst these presales, EV2 has become one of the names circulating heavily in these discussions. The EV2 token presale has already cleared 46.18 million tokens, raising more than $431,3800 out of the possible $500,000. EV2 presale price sits at $0.01, attracting both gamers and crypto investors. Early adopters can use ETH, BTC, SOL, BNB, select stablecoins as well as credit card to purchase the token. Why is the EV2 token presale gaining traction so fast? EV2 token is set to serve as the primary token for the Earth Version 2 in-game economy. This game is a Web3-based MMO looter-shooter game offering an immersive experience to players while allowing them to earn rewards in form of EV2 token. Players can use this token to upgrade suits and gain access to exclusive battles. The game features several modes. For instance, its “Fracture Mode” pushes players into a survival setting where they collect luminous cubes, chase artifacts, and compete for token-based rewards. The system ties every action into the EV2 token economy, supported by NFTs that unlock in-game advantages. It avoids the repetitive cycle that tanked earlier play-to-earn experiments. Analyst Notes TRX’s Stability During Recent Market Slump Analysts monitoring the recent market drop recorded a clear divide between TRX and the major altcoins. Meghan Crypto, for instance, highlighted that TRX absorbed the recent market drop that saw BTC drop below $94,000 better than other top-cap altcoins. https://x.com/Meghan_Crypt/status/1990370968921940164 Instead, Tron maintained a narrow band and remained calm despite forced liquidations. On-chain data has further backed Tron's stability, as per Meghan. TRON’s daily active wallets recently surpassed 11 million and stay at a high level. USDT flows still dominate the chain, with roughly $80 billion moving through the network daily during peak volume. On the other hand, JustLend, the network’s lending protocol, holds a total value of billions and continues to deliver stable yields between 8% and 12%. This, combined with the network performance, strengthens Tron’s breakout argument on the chart. Price Outlook: Can TRX Secure $0.33? At the moment, TRX has proved to be resilient even under broader market pressure, recorded significant user engagement, and received a new burst of attention as EV2 presale continues to attract more investors to the ecosystem. If the market’s sentiment stabilizes and TRON continues to benefit from high-volume stablecoin flows, $0.33 could become a realistic checkpoint rather than distant speculation.

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) has begun to rise, speculative sentiment and token burns are still the driving forces behind its price growth. On the other hand, the DeFi ecosystem is shifting toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as it builds structured financial products with predictable growth and reliable returns. The speculative money in crypto is shifting toward engineered value products. While aiming to get in on the best crypto to buy, the shift from meme coins to profit-generating protocols is the crypto trend of 2025. The Limitations of Meme Coin Economics Shiba Inu (SHIB) has shown strength by getting stable at around $0.00000980. It has support due to the growth of the Shibarium network and the Shiba Inu token burning. However, broader market sentiment and the speculation within the Shiba Inu community still predominantly guide this token. Even though the token burning process adds some scarcity, the primary economic model still does not directly earn any revenue nor yield for the holders. This leads to reliance on speculative value, which is why savvy traders have started rotating capital into other productive assets like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Momentum As one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the definite alternative for investors. Innovations and profit go hand in hand for this investment. Capital for the presale in progress has been raised phenomenally, gaining over $18.75 million and over 18,050 holders to the community. The project is in its most important 6th Phase, with tokens available for a very affordable price of $0.035. This opportunity is closing very quickly, with over 90% of the tokens sold. Once Phase 7 is active, the price will rise nearly 20% to $0.040. This is one of the most advantageous and possibly last moments to invest at this price before the tokens go to the exchange. Dual Lending Mutuum Finance is a decentralized and non-custodial lending marketplace that facilitates lending and borrowing of cryptocurrencies through a secure smart contract platform. Traditional lending protocols operate through pooled resources alone, but Mutuum Finance implements a dual lending model that comprises Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. With the P2C model, the user deposits funds into a community pool that is managed through the use of smart contracts. The user earns mtTokens that show the ownership and the interest that the owner earns over time. The borrower gets the funds through overcollateralization terms that ensure the funds of the lenders are not put at risk. The model works similarly to other DeFi protocols such as Aave and Compound. Mutuum’s P2P lending system provides a custom loan agreement to lenders and borrowers. The custom loan terms include the interest rate and the collateral for the tokens that are considered volatile and cannot be lent through pooled lending. This feature of Mutuum is most beneficial to meme coins holders and other high-risk assets. Roadmap and Launch Mutuum Finance has a phased developmental schedule to ensure a safe and scalable launch of the dual lending protocol. V1 protocol debut is set to take place this quarter on the Sepolia testnet. The first version of the protocol will include lending and borrowing functionalities for ETH and USDT. After the testnet, Mutuum Finance intends to launch the mainnet with more functionalities such as enhanced P2P functions for volatile and meme tokens, a robust system of staking the mtToken, and the buy-and-distribute tokenomics model functioning completely. This will ensure that any bugs and vulnerabilities are removed before the protocol becomes completely functional. The Strategic Shift is Already Underway As we approach 2026, meme coin holders are shifting to DeFi instead of just waiting idly. Most will zealously partake in the ecosystem that is Mutuum Finance. The ongoing presale offers cutting-edge daily self-earn programs, built with user safety in mind. Since we are in the last stages of phase 6, it will only take a few days for the allocated presale to sell through. Join while there’s still time.

Recent data reveals a concerning trend that’s affecting nearly half of the XRP investment community. According to Glassnode’s latest analysis, the landscape for XRP holders has shifted dramatically, with profitability rates hitting their lowest point in months. Why Are XRP Holders Experiencing These Losses? The current situation shows that only 58.5% of XRP holders remain in profit, while a staggering 41.5% now find themselves in loss positions. This marks the most challenging period for XRP holders since November 2024, when the cryptocurrency traded at just $0.53. Despite XRP’s current price of $2.15, the underlying market structure appears unstable. Glassnode’s analysis indicates that many XRP holders purchased their positions at higher price points. This creates a scenario where: Recent buyers face immediate paper losses Long-term holders see their profits evaporate The overall market sentiment becomes cautious What Does This Mean for Current XRP Holders? If you’re among the XRP holders currently experiencing losses, understanding the market dynamics becomes crucial. The data suggests that the current price level isn’t sustainable for many investors who entered at peak prices. This creates pressure that could influence future price movements. For XRP holders considering their next move, several factors deserve attention: Market timing – When did you purchase your XRP? Investment strategy – Are you trading or holding long-term? Risk tolerance – How much volatility can you withstand? How Can XRP Holders Navigate This Volatile Period? Successful XRP holders often employ strategic approaches during market downturns. While every investor’s situation differs, some proven methods include: Dollar-cost averaging can help XRP holders reduce their average entry price. This strategy involves purchasing smaller amounts at regular intervals rather than timing the market. Many experienced XRP holders use this approach to manage risk during uncertain periods. Another consideration for XRP holders is portfolio diversification. While XRP may represent a significant portion of your crypto holdings, spreading investments across different assets can provide stability during market fluctuations. What’s the Future Outlook for XRP Holders? The current data doesn’t necessarily predict long-term outcomes for XRP holders. Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility, and positions can change rapidly. However, the current statistics serve as an important reminder about market cycles and investment timing. XRP holders should monitor key indicators such as: Trading volume patterns Market sentiment shifts Regulatory developments Adoption news and partnerships Final Thoughts for Concerned XRP Holders The reality that over 41% of XRP holders face losses underscores the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency investments. However, historical patterns show that market conditions can change quickly. The most successful XRP holders typically maintain perspective during challenging periods and make decisions based on research rather than emotion. Remember that being among XRP holders experiencing temporary losses doesn’t define your long-term investment success. Market corrections often create opportunities for strategic investors who understand the fundamental value of their assets. Frequently Asked Questions What percentage of XRP holders are currently profitable? Currently, 58.5% of XRP holders remain in profit, while 41.5% are experiencing losses according to Glassnode data. When was the last time XRP holder profitability was this low? The current profitability level for XRP holders is the lowest since November 2024, when XRP traded at $0.53. Should XRP holders sell during this downturn? This depends on individual investment goals and risk tolerance. Many experienced XRP holders consider market downturns as potential buying opportunities rather than selling triggers. What factors affect XRP holder profitability? XRP holder profitability is influenced by purchase price, market timing, overall cryptocurrency market trends, and specific XRP-related developments. How can XRP holders improve their position? XRP holders can consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging, portfolio rebalancing, and staying informed about market developments to manage their positions effectively. Is this normal for XRP holders to experience such volatility? Yes, cryptocurrency investments including XRP are known for their volatility. Periods of profit and loss are common in crypto markets.

The S-1/A filing dated November 17 introduces several administrative adjustments that include a ticker change to 21SH, updated share registration language, and a revised IRS employer identification number. The updated document keeps the broader framework of the ETF unchanged while signaling ongoing progress toward regulatory clearance. This development arrives during a week when Solana trades near its lowest levels in months, creating a notable intersection between regulatory movement and market pressure. Filing Adjustments and Regulatory Structure The updated filing confirms the ETF’s plan to track the CME CF Solana-Dollar Reference Rate. It also confirms that the fund will avoid leverage and derivatives. Additionally, the document outlines a staking component that the sponsor may activate if regulatory conditions remain favorable. The filing also explains the creation and redemption process, which continues to use 10,000-share baskets. Moreover, the document identifies Coinbase Custody, Anchorage Digital, and BitGo as the custodians responsible for holding the ETF’s SOL. The sponsor kept the broader structure unchanged. Hence, the new amendment highlights incremental progress rather than major strategic shifts. The filing lists Cboe BZX as the expected exchange and retains earlier language about continuous issuance. Besides the technical mechanics, analysts note that the amendment signals continued engagement with regulators during a challenging market period for Solana. Solana Price Holds a Key Band Despite Heavy Selling Solana trades near $130 after a sharp weekly decline that erased more than 22%.

Ethereum Treasury Firms Are Looking Unhealthy In a new thread on X, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has discussed some metrics related to Ethereum treasury companies . A treasury firm refers to a public corporation that has adopted a digital asset like Bitcoin or Ethereum as its reserve strategy. The idea was popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which pivoted to being a BTC treasury firm back in 2020. Since then, the company has grown into by far the largest corporate digital asset holder, with a whopping $47.54 billion invested. Earlier, companies were looking at only the number one cryptocurrency as a viable reserve asset, but this year, there has been a rise in holders of ETH, the coin ranked just behind BTC. The Ethereum treasury frenzy peaked in August, but since then, the growth rate attached to them has witnessed a slowdown, as the chart below shared by Edwards shows. From the graph, it’s clear that the rate of change for Ethereum treasuries is positive even after the slowdown, suggesting that companies remain in net accumulation. This has meant that, despite the outflows that the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have witnessed recently, institutional buying still remains above the cryptocurrency’s supply growth, although only just. While corporate accumulation continues, the ETH treasury business model may not be working for a lot of the firms. As the analyst has pointed out, the majority of companies have an mNAV value less than 1. mNAV, standing for Multiple of Net Asset Value, is a metric that compares the market cap of a treasury firm against the total value of its reserve assets. The indicator being below the 1 mark naturally implies the firm’s valuation is less than its treasury’s worth. About 64.3% of all Ethereum treasury firms currently fall into this zone. “That means the treasury company picture is a lot more unhealthy for ETH than Bitcoin,” explained Edwards. Clearly, ETH treasuries are coming under pressure, so are any of them reacting by selling? Data suggests not many, as the net buy/sell ratio related to them still remains strong. That said, while almost all Ethereum corporate holders are still net buyers, the buy/sell ratio has started to show a decline as the asset’s price has experienced its recent bearish shift. ETH Price Ethereum plunged toward $3,000 on Sunday, but the coin has since seen a small jump back to $3,200.",Ethereum|ETH|Ethereum treasury|Ethereum Treasury Company|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-17 22:00:33

According to the analysis, the daily chart has hit a historically oversold MACD reading not seen in years, aligning with a deeply oversold RSI. This confluence of extreme momentum signals suggests that the price has entered a major demand zone, dramatically increasing the likelihood of a powerful relief rally and setting the stage for a significant short-term rebound. MACD Hits Rare Historical Lows — A Zone Linked To Major ETH Bottoms According to a recent post from More Crypto Online, Ethereum is currently flashing one of its most extreme MACD readings seen in years on the daily timeframe. While the MACD technically has no fixed oversold threshold, comparing past cycles gives valuable context. Historically, ETH has often formed significant market bottoms whenever the MACD enters the -210 to -220 region, a zone it has dipped below a few times, but not often. Related Reading: Ethereum Slips to $3K, Highlighting Weakness After Recent Failed Rebound This puts the current MACD position into what can be considered a historically oversold zone, signaling increased potential for a relief bounce. Adding to this confluence, the RSI has also slipped deep into oversold territory, reinforcing the idea that sell pressure may be nearing exhaustion. Together, both indicators suggest that momentum could soon shift away from the bears. However, the analyst cautions that these signals alone do not confirm a major trend reversal. Oversold conditions can persist longer than expected, particularly in strong downtrends. Even so, such extreme readings are often early clues that a temporary recovery or a corrective move to the upside may be approaching. Overall, the current market structure gives the bears something to think about. Early Signs Of Relief: Ethereum Finds Stability In Key Demand Zone In a 3D market update, CryptoPulse reported that Ethereum has now cleanly tapped the identified Demand Zone, showing early signs that the aggressive downside may be easing. This reaction suggests sellers are losing momentum, creating the conditions for a potential short-term rebound if buyers step back in. Should bullish strength return, a retest of the $3,500 region is likely in the coming sessions. Related Reading: Ethereum Approaches Critical Resistance — Bullish Breakout Or Trap In The Making? However, CryptoPulse emphasized that confirmation is still required before calling any meaningful reversal. A strong bounce paired with a reclaim of key short-term levels would be the first signal that buyers are regaining control. Meanwhile, if bearish pressure persists, Ethereum may drift deeper into the chart structure, where the next significant demand sits between $2,400 and $2,600. This zone could act as the major support zone for ETH if the current support fails to hold.

Bloomberg Analyst McGlone Evaluates,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/why-did-bitcoin-fall-can-we-say-weve-entered-a-bear-market-bloomberg-analyst-mcglone-evaluates/,"Markets are reeling as Bitcoin plummets into bear market territory, erasing all of its gains from 2025. This sharp decline led to liquidations of over $1.1 billion, with an additional $2 billion outflow from digital asset products. Cryptocurrency markets are facing a massive sell-off, led by Bitcoin. The largest has officially entered a bear market, reversing all gains made through 2025. This decline has triggered a massive liquidation storm that has claimed over $1.1 billion in the markets. The sudden market crash was discussed in a discussion among macro strategists broadcast on the “The Wolf of All Streets” YouTube channel. Analysts warned that the current extreme volatility and cascading liquidations are reminiscent of past major market crashes. Bloomberg Senior Commodity Strategist Mike McGlone expressed concern about whether a modern-day “Black Monday” could be imminent for cryptocurrencies and potentially even stock markets. Related News: Bitcoin Drops Below $92,000, Ethereum Falls Below $3,000 - Here's the Latest Situation on the Dark Night According to expert analysis, there are several critical factors behind this negative market sentiment: Weakening Support Flows: Decreased fresh money entering the market. Rising Macro Tension: External factors such as global economic uncertainties and central bank policies are increasing pressure. Panic in Derivatives Markets: The prevalence of fear in futures and options markets and its reflection on spot markets. Insider Selling in Technology Stocks: In addition to macroeconomic concerns, experts also noted heavy insider selling in technology stocks. McGlone believes this isn't a “false correction,” but rather the start of an accelerating bear market and a period of “dominoes” falling. He believes Bitcoin will continue to lead the decline until the macroeconomic outlook improves. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Why Did Bitcoin Fall?

The trade left the wallet with just 847,000 USDA, an estimated 87% loss, and reopened tough questions about Cardano’s DeFi readiness. The Costly Transaction According to on-chain investigator ZachXBT, the whale wallet had been dormant for roughly five years before executing the swap, which temporarily pushed the USDA price far above its peg due to thin liquidity. Lookonchain reported the transaction at 14.45 million ADA, with a valuation just north of $7 million, resulting in the user receiving 847,694 USDA and incurring a loss of approximately $6.2 million. Screenshots shared by community member $DeFiPunk show the DEX interface flashing a “high price impact” warning and estimated slippage of over 87%, with the user manually ticking the “I understand this warning” checkbox before confirming the transaction. That has sparked debate over whether this was a reckless move, an honest mistake from an “inexperienced voucher holder,” as Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson suggested, or even a deliberate attention play to highlight liquidity issues. Reactions from the Cardano community were mixed. Some, like Cardano YOD₳, argued that “one bad swap can have negative reputational consequences” and questioned whether the ecosystem has its priorities right, pointing to marketing and governance debates instead of basic liquidity. Others countered that the issue was primarily “a liquidity first problem, and a DEX problem second,” criticizing the slow delivery of UX upgrades and the need for better batching solutions. Hoskinson, responding on X, called it a “teachable moment” for scaling Cardano’s DeFi in 2026, while firmly rejecting calls to compensate the whale. Market Pressure and Ecosystem Demands The multimillion-dollar blunder marks a continuation of a period of pressure for Cardano, with on-chain data from earlier in the month showing whales offloading 4 million ADA in a week as prices dropped from above $0.60 to roughly $0.53, further deepening bearish sentiment. Just days later, on November 11, there was renewed accumulation, with other large holders scooping up nearly 1% of the supply during a dip below $0.50, leading analysts to predict a possible rebound if ADA could reclaim the $0.70 area. This has not yet occurred, with the asset, which is ranked the eleventh-largest in terms of market cap, trading around $0.50, down approximately 17% in the last week and 22% over the past 30 days, according to CoinGecko data. Meanwhile, the episode has intensified calls for greater stablecoin liquidity on Cardano. Commentator Lorenzo argued plainly, “We need to 10x the stablecoin liquidity withdrawal right now.” This sentiment was echoed by others who believe the incident proves there is a substantial demand for moving capital on the network, but a lack of infrastructure to support it. However, Hoskinson repeatedly asserted , “It is not my job to bring a stablecoin to Cardano,” placing the responsibility on the broader ecosystem.

Down 75% year-to-date and shedding 19% in just the past week, PEPE is losing steam fast while rivals like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu hold stronger positions. With the Fed casting doubt on a December rate cut, risk appetite is fading across the board — and PEPE might be the first to break under pressure. Data from the CME Group’s FedWatch survey reflected how analysts’ revisited their projections for the next FOMC meeting. The odds that they would implement a rate cut in December dropped dramatically, from 91% back then to 45% at the time of writing. This significant shift in the market’s baseline scenario catalyzed the downward move we have seen in the past few days. Meme coins, including Pepe, have plunged as a result. Pepe Price Prediction: PEPE Drops Below Key Support and Could Lose Another 30% The latest selling pressure has pushed Pepe below a key support area at $0.0000055. As a result, it has formed a bearish descending price channel. Pepe could bounce off the lower bound of this setup in the next few days. However, it still needs to recapture the purple area highlighted in the chart if bulls want to prevent another crash. The next target for the token would be the 0.0000035 area, meaning a 29.8% downside risk. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains heavily depressed at 32, meaning that it is near oversold territory. This increases the odds of a rebound. However, since bearish momentum is so strong, a decisive break above $0.0000050 would be required to confirm a bullish outlook. Although Pepe’s upside potential seems limited at the time, a project called Pepenode ($PEPENODE) is attracting millions from investors. Its successful crypto presale could transform how users mine meme coins forever. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Makes Meme Coin Mining Hardware-Free Mining used to mean expensive gear, but Pepenode ($PEPENODE) changes everything with virtual rigs you can launch instantly and no hardware required .

This groundbreaking move brings sophisticated blockchain infrastructure to mainstream investors through a familiar investment vehicle. What Makes the Canton Network ETF So Revolutionary? The Canton Network ETF represents more than just another cryptocurrency fund. It specifically targets the Canton Network, a privacy-preserving Layer 1 blockchain designed for institutional use. Unlike traditional blockchain networks, Canton prioritizes confidentiality while maintaining interoperability between financial applications. This unique approach addresses one of the biggest concerns in institutional adoption: data privacy. James Seyffart, Bloomberg’s renowned ETF analyst, broke the news on social media platform X, highlighting the significance of this filing. The Canton Network ETF could potentially open doors for investors who want exposure to advanced blockchain infrastructure without directly managing complex cryptocurrency assets. Why Should Investors Care About This Development? The timing of this Canton Network ETF filing couldn’t be more strategic. As regulatory clarity improves and institutional interest in blockchain technology grows, this fund positions itself at the intersection of several key trends: Privacy-focused technology gaining importance in digital assets Institutional adoption of blockchain infrastructure Regulatory-compliant investment vehicles for crypto exposure Interoperability solutions becoming crucial for blockchain scalability Moreover, the Canton Network ETF offers a structured way to invest in blockchain’s underlying technology rather than just cryptocurrency prices. This distinction matters because it represents a shift from speculative trading to infrastructure investment. How Does the Canton Network Differ From Other Blockchains? The Canton Network stands out in the crowded blockchain space through its unique architecture. Designed specifically for financial applications, it enables: Selective data sharing between authorized parties only High transaction throughput suitable for institutional use Regulatory compliance built into the network design Interoperability with existing financial systems This specialized approach makes the Canton Network ETF particularly appealing to investors seeking exposure to enterprise-grade blockchain solutions. The network’s focus on privacy and compliance addresses two major hurdles that have traditionally limited institutional blockchain adoption. What Challenges Might the Canton Network ETF Face? While the filing represents exciting progress, several challenges remain. Regulatory approval processes for cryptocurrency ETFs have proven complex and time-consuming. The SEC has historically been cautious about approving crypto-related investment products, particularly those involving newer technologies. Additionally, investor education will be crucial. Many traditional investors may not fully understand the distinction between investing in a blockchain network versus investing in cryptocurrencies themselves. The success of this Canton Network ETF will depend on clear communication about what exactly investors are gaining exposure to. What Does This Mean for the Future of Blockchain Investing? The 21Shares Canton Network ETF filing signals a maturation in the digital asset space. It demonstrates that investment firms recognize the value in blockchain infrastructure beyond just cryptocurrency tokens. This development could pave the way for more specialized blockchain ETFs focusing on specific technological aspects rather than broad market exposure. As blockchain technology continues evolving, we may see more investment products targeting specific use cases and technological innovations. The Canton Network ETF could become the blueprint for future infrastructure-focused digital asset funds. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Canton Network? The Canton Network is a privacy-focused Layer 1 blockchain designed specifically for financial institutions, enabling secure and compliant transactions between authorized parties. When will the Canton Network ETF be available? The ETF is currently in the filing stage with regulatory authorities. Approval timelines vary, but the process typically takes several months. How is this ETF different from Bitcoin or Ethereum ETFs? Unlike cryptocurrency ETFs that track digital asset prices, the Canton Network ETF provides exposure to blockchain infrastructure technology rather than cryptocurrency tokens themselves. Who can invest in this ETF? Once approved, the ETF will be available to all investors through traditional brokerage accounts, similar to other exchange-traded funds. What are the risks of investing in blockchain technology ETFs? Rights include regulatory uncertainty, technological adoption rates, market volatility, and the emerging nature of blockchain infrastructure investments. Why did 21Shares choose the Canton Network for this ETF? 21Shares likely selected the Canton Network due to its unique privacy features, institutional focus, and potential for widespread financial application adoption.

According to its projections, holders of these top assets could see their portfolios bulge by Christmas. The Federal Reserve’s recent 25-basis-point rate cut has greenlit investors for risk-on sentiment. Despite this, crypto markets have suffered a protracted pullback, with Bitcoin bottoming around $93,000 in the early hours of today UTC. However, crypto markets historically operate in cycles, with steep corrections often marking the transition between phases. These resets help clear leverage, restore healthy market structure, and set the stage for the next major upward move. Here’s why Alibaba’s AI expects XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum to surge when markets rebound. XRP (XRP): Alibaba AI Predicts a Near 600% Rally Before New Year Alibaba’s model estimates that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could surge into the $10–$15 range before year-end, a potential increase of over 560% from its current value near $2.33. Source: Alibaba’s Qwen3-MAX XRP soared to $3.65 in July after Ripple secured a key legal win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, marking its highest level in seven years. Over the last 12 months, XRP has jumped roughly 112%, decisively outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ripple’s introduction of its RLUSD stablecoin, persistent engagement with global regulators, and CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s policy outreach in Washington have all helped solidify XRP’s image as a regulation-friendly asset with possible influence over emerging U.S. crypto policy. On the technical side, XRP has been moving within a tight consolidation channel since midsummer, between support at $2 and resistance around $3.50. With an RSI around 47, the token retains room for upward movement, although a sustained rally hinges on external catalysts. Canary Capital’s spot XRP ETF was listed on Nasdaq, but it failed to light the fuse on a rally due to ongoing bearishness, and several XRP ETFs are still pending due to a partial US government shutdown that ended last week. Alibaba believes further spot ETF approvals, major banking partnerships, or sweeping regulatory clarity could propel XRP as high as $15 by 2026. Bitcoin ($BTC): Alibaba AI Sees Santa Bringing $150,000 BTC Bitcoin ($BTC) remains the market’s dominant asset, recently setting a new all-time high at $126,080 on October 6. Alibaba’s predictive models suggest Bitcoin could stage a new breakout, potentially climbing toward the $150,000 mark by 2026. Often described as digital gold, Bitcoin attracts institutional and retail capital as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty. It currently capitalizes $1.9 trillion of the total $3.33 trillion crypto market. However, with inflation cooling and the likelihood of increased risk appetite by Christmas, Bitcoin could soon revisit record levels. The Fed’s recent decision to further slash interest rates could act as a catalyst for a strong Q4 run. Organic market momentum could realistically push Bitcoin back to $125,000. Alibaba’s $150k projection is also feasible, but such a timely recovery would be greatly helped if the U.S. administration makes good on its word to deliver a comprehensive legislative framework for crypto companies. Ethereum (ETH): Alibaba Forecasts a Surge Toward $15,000 As the backbone of decentralized applications, smart contracts, and the broader DeFi landscape, Ethereum ($ETH) continues to command a powerful position. With a market cap of $384.5 billion and more than $72 billion in total value locked , Ethereum remains the industry’s leading programmable blockchain. Alibaba’s AI models predict ETH could accelerate toward $15,000 by year-end, an anticipated 373% jump from its current price near $3,173. Further upside could materialize if the Trump administration rolls out sweeping crypto-friendly policies, giving institutions the regulatory clarity needed to scale exposure. Ethereum’s security, settlement reliability, and leadership in real-world asset tokenization and stablecoins make it a prime beneficiary of institutional inflows. ETH faces heavy resistance in the upper $4,000 region. A decisive breakout could support a run toward a new all-time high near $6,000 by late November. If holiday trading momentum strengthens, Alibaba believes Ethereum could approach the $15,000 threshold by Christmas. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A High-Energy Meme Coin Gaining Rapid Traction Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is emerging as one of the most talked-about new meme tokens, attracting significant buzz across the crypto community. With more than $4 million raised so far in its presale, MAXI blends classic Dogecoin’s fun and irreverence with more efficient blockchain tech and community-building. Marketed as Dogecoin’s wilder gigachad cousin, Maxi Doge aims to revive the original degen vibe of meme-coin culture: chaotic and fun. The project emphasizes community building through meme contests, interactive campaigns, and a fast-growing social presence. Launched as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI benefits from the network’s energy efficiency, scalability improvements, and robust developer ecosystem, advantages over Dogecoin’s legacy proof-of-work architecture. Out of the total 150.24 billion MAXI supply, 25% is allocated to the “Maxi Fund” to support marketing and ecosystem growth. Staking is currently live, offering returns of up to 76% APY, though the rate will decrease as participation increases. The presale price is set at $0.0002685, with incremental raises planned in upcoming stages. Investors can purchase MAXI through MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Seasoned crypto traders see the pullback as temporary, and in many ways necessary, to the continual growth of a robust, no-nonsense crypto market. Market resets like this flush out excess leverage and speculative excess, helping build the foundation for stronger, more durable uptrends later on. Additionally, it’s clear that Bitcoin, with its dominant “store of value” narrative, probably won’t be the leader of the next bull run, as there are tokens that will play a larger role in crypto’s institutional use-cases. Here’s why XRP, Solana, and Dash are top contenders for the next major bull cycle. XRP (XRP): Powering the Next Generation of Global Transactions Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) continues to transform cross-border payments through its fast, low-cost blockchain settlement system that has the potential to make SWIFT obsolete. The technology has been highlighted in reports from the UN Capital Development Fund and the White House, while Ripple continues to garner high-profile partnerships with major financial institutions. This has helped XRP solidify its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, supported by a market cap near $137 billion. Ripple’s RLUSD, a U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin, underscores its commitment to gaining a foothold in what many experts view as the most vital future segment of digital payments. Every RLUSD transaction on the XRP Ledger requires a small XRP burn, directly linking network usage to long-term token valuation. XRP has surged 112% over the past year, hitting $3.65 in July, its first new all-time high since 2018. For comparison, Bitcoin gained only 5% across the same period. If U.S. regulators approve spot crypto ETFs and pass Project Crypto, the proposed regulatory framework for digital assets, analysts believe XRP could realistically aim for $10 or higher by early 2026. Solana (SOL): Ethereum’s Biggest Competitor Sets Sights on $1,000 Solana ($SOL) has established itself as one of the fastest and most scalable smart-contract platforms in the industry. With an $79 billion market cap and $9.4 billion in total value locked (TVL), Solana remains the second-largest DeFi ecosystem after Ethereum. This year’s approval of Grayscale and Bitwise Solana spot ETFs on the New York Stock Exchange opened the door for fresh institutional inflows, a catalyst that previously fueled major rallies in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. After dipping to roughly $100 earlier in the year, SOL has rebounded to about $142. Technical indicators show a bullish flag structure forming since mid-September, and analysts highlight the $150 region as a critical support zone, with major resistance expected around $250. A decisive breakout above that band could allow Solana to retest its previous all-time high of $293.31 and potentially extend toward $450. In a strong 2026 cycle. In a bull cycle, SOL could even push toward the $1,000 mark. Dash ($DASH): A Bitcoin Fork Outperformed Both Bitcoin and XRP in the Last Year Dash ($DASH) is a digital currency designed to make everyday payments fast, inexpensive, and user-friendly. Originally launched in 2014 as a fork of Bitcoin, its name, short for “Digital Cash,” reflects its mission to function as a practical medium of exchange. One of Dash’s defining features is its two-tier network. Regular miners secure the blockchain, while masternodes handle advanced functions such as InstantSend and ChainLocks. InstantSend allows transactions to settle within seconds, making Dash suitable for real-world purchases, while ChainLocks helps protect the network against 51% attacks. Dash once gained significant traction as a payment solution in regions with unstable currencies, most notably in parts of Latin America. Although its popularity has fluctuated with market cycles, the project continues to focus on merchant adoption, low-fee transactions, and ongoing protocol upgrades. In the last 30 days, Dash has blown up 86% while its current price of $84 has not deviated far from its 30-day moving average. A relatively neutral relative strength index of 52 suggests there’s plenty of headroom to gro,w and Dash’s rally may well continue through this week. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): A Meme Coin With Practical Utility and Layer-2 Scaling Power One newcomer tipped to be a 2026 runaway success story is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a genuine blockchain infrastructure project that comes in a meme coin package. HYPER delivers real utility as a Bitcoin Layer-2 protocol, designed to boost throughput, cut fees, and introduce smart-contract capabilities to Bitcoin. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper supports DAO governance and features a Canonical bridge to seamlessly move your Bitcoin between chains. The project has already secured $27.8 million during its presale, with analysts such as Borch Crypto predicting potential gains of up to 100×. A recent audit from Coinsult found no security vulnerabilities in the smart contract, strengthening investor confidence. The HYPER token fuels staking mechanisms, network fees, and platform governance, and early presale participants can earn up to 41% APY. Bitcoin is going $HYPER in 2026!

The asset manager, which manages about $1.6 trillion, disclosed that the product is scheduled to begin trading on November 18 once regulatory conditions are met. The move forms one of the first fully structured spot XRP ETF frameworks filed in the United States and adds to a growing slate of crypto-related submissions awaiting SEC review. 🚨 🚨 BREAKING NEWS: Coinbase Custody will serve as the custodian for Franklin Templeton’s spot XRP ETF (ticker: EZRP).This is confirmed in the final prospectus filed with the SEC and in Franklin Templeton’s official announcements. $1.6T FT will launch tomorrow November 18 pic.twitter.com/O7vMJ0BBez — Kenny Nguyen (@mrnguyen007) November 17, 2025 The fund, which would trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange, is intended to offer exposure to XRP, currently the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Coinbase Custody would safeguard the ETF’s XRP assets, while Coinbase, operating separately, would act as the prime broker for trade execution services. CSC Delaware Trust Company would oversee trust management responsibilities as trustee. Franklin Templeton stated that the ETF shares will be issued and redeemed at net asset value through authorized participants, consistent with other spot crypto ETF mechanisms. Key Disclosures in the Filing The net asset value of the fund would be based on the CME CF XRP -Dollar Reference Rate, a standard asset price index that is typically applied across financial products in the digital-asset sector. In the framework described in the filing, the sponsor of the fund, Franklin Holdings, has consented to pay the majority of typical operating expenses in exchange with a sponsor fee. The trust is classified as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, which provides it with some reporting accommodations in its initial years of operation. The SEC acknowledged the filing within days of multiple other XRP ETF submissions , including Grayscale’s February 14 application, which initiated a 240-day review process. The acknowledgment marked the first time the regulator has formally responded to proposals involving investment products that directly hold XRP, even as the SEC continues its separate litigation against Ripple Labs concerning XRP’s regulatory classification. Institutional XRP Products Begin to Expand There has been an increase in interest in XRP investment vehicles. Bitwise, just under two days after Franklin Templeton indicated that it would launch, began to announce that it would start trading its own spot XRP fund on November 20. The company claimed that its product is targeted at institutional investors, including hedge funds and family offices, who require a regulated investment in the asset. The new investment products on XRP have been given a boost by their recent market performance. Furthermore, the Canary Capital XRPC product generated approximately $58 million during its initial trading on the first day. An XRP-based product raised $243 million in its initial launch, outperforming the $111.7 million raised by the first launch of the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. Market Observations Following ETF Developments Although XRP has suffered a pullback following these product launches, analysts quoted by market trackers have noted that the downtrend occurred during an overall weak market period. In commentary, analysts, including E. Grag Crypto, Javon Marks, and Ripple Bull Winkle, assert that the recent price action was not in line with changes in ETF trading volumes. Their publicly issued evaluations cited historical price patterns and previous market responses, but failed to attribute the retracement to ETF-related activity.

CZ Unveils Binance Plans if Refunded $4.3 Billion Replying to an X user’s post on Monday asking what would happen to the settlement money if refunded, Zhao said it was a “delicate question.” Hi @cz_binance , I wonder if they will refund your $4.3 billion since you are pardoned? Asking for a friend. — Anndy Lian (@anndylian) November 16, 2025 “I appreciate the pardon already,” the newly pardoned crypto founder said. “There is a balance in asking for more vs ‘what is fair’ vs appreciating what you got already. Zhao said that should Binance see the $4.3 billion returned, the crypto company “will be investing that in America anyway, to show our appreciation.” “Haven’t asked yet, I think,” he added. Rep. Maxine Waters Lambasts Trump’s Pardon Of CZ News of Zhao’s intentions came nearly one month after he was pardoned by Trump for failing to maintain anti-money laundering safeguards at Binance back in 2023. Binance Holdings Limited itself pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act, failure to register as a money transmitting business, and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Binance agreed to pay over $4 billion in forfeiture, while Zhao was ordered to pay $50 million in fines in order to resolve the landmark crypto case . “Deeply grateful for today’s pardon and to President Trump for upholding America’s commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice,” Zhao wrote in an October 23 X post. “Will do everything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto and advance web3 worldwide.” However, not everyone was pleased with Zhao’s pardon , with Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) calling it a way to “effectively legitimize the crypto crime CZ was convicted of.” “Trump’s pardon of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao—who pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering and facilitating suspicious transactions with child abusers, drug dealers, and terrorists—is an appalling but unsurprising reflection of his presidency: one defined by corruption, self-interest, and loyalty to criminals over working-class American families,” she said in an October 2025 statement. It is still unclear whether or not Binance will reclaim the $4.3 billion.

With Tokenized Real Assets, Yes",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/fast-crypto-millionaires-not-with-memes-with-tokenized-real-assets-yes/,"Over the past few market cycles, meme tokens have dominated headlines with sudden rallies and viral surges. But 2025 is telling a different story. With volatility rising and investors becoming more selective, attention is shifting toward a sector that looks far more grounded: tokenized real assets. This is where new capital is flowing, and the narrative is no longer built on hype but on measurable economic foundations. One of the projects gaining momentum in this space is RentStac , a platform that tokenizes income-producing real estate and converts rental revenue into on-chain value. It is not driven by memes or social sentiment. It is built on predictable cash flow, legal structure and transparent yield mechanisms. And with a presale price still under 0.03 dollars, RentStac makes it possible to calculate the long-term potential using realistic numbers rather than speculation. Why Tokenized Real Assets Are Replacing Memecoins in Investor Portfolios Memecoins thrive on emotional cycles and social media waves. When sentiment flips, the support disappears instantly. Tokenized real assets operate in a fundamentally different way and are outperforming meme-based models for three reasons. Real underlying value Each token is linked to a physical asset that generates measurable income. Recurring and predictable cash flow Returns are driven by rental payments, not by hype or trends. Institutional adoption is accelerating Banks, asset managers and regulators are preparing for the real-world asset market to grow into the trillions. As the speculative phase of the market cools, investors are shifting toward projects that combine blockchain efficiency with the stability of traditional assets. RentStac sits exactly in this growing intersection. How RentStac Works and Why It Stands Out RentStac simplifies real estate tokenization. Each property is placed into a dedicated SPV, which isolates ownership and ensures legal clarity. Rental income from the property flows into staking pools, funds token buybacks and supports a deflationary supply model. Key features: • real rental income converted into on-chain yield • buybacks funded by actual revenue • governance rights for long-term holders • professional SPV structure with transparent ownership • presale entry still below 0.03 dollars This blend of real-world revenue and token-level incentives is attracting investors searching for structured, lower-volatility opportunities. The Sub 0.03 Dollar Presale That Is Drawing Attention The current presale price of RNS is 0.025 dollars with a 70 percent token bonus for contributions above 500 dollars. The final presale phase is listed at 0.055 dollars. This progression allows investors to measure potential returns based on clear, published pricing instead of hypothetical projections. How Much It Takes to Reach One Million: Updated Calculations For the first time in a market often driven by speculation, the numbers can be calculated directly using the current presale structure. Example with a 500 dollar contribution Current price: 0.025 dollars Bonus: 70 percent Token calculation: • 500 dollars divided by 0.025 = 20,000 RNS • 70 percent bonus = 14,000 RNS • Total = 34,000 RNS Value at the end of the presale at 0.055 dollars 34,000 RNS x 0.055 = 1,870 dollars Even before listings, the initial capital multiplies. Value when RNS reaches 1 dollar in a low, conservative scenario 34,000 RNS x 1 dollar = 34,000 dollars This is not an aggressive forecast but a level many analysts consider achievable for real-world asset tokens. The Updated Path to One Million Dollars To reach 1,000,000 dollars at a future price of 1 dollar, an investor needs exactly 1,000,000 RNS. With the current 70 percent bonus, the calculation is: 1,000,000 RNS divided by 1.70 = 588,235 RNS required Cost today: 588,235 RNS x 0.025 dollars = 14,705 dollars In other words, with an investment of roughly 14,700 dollars at today’s presale price, reaching the one-million mark at 1 dollar falls within a mathematically realistic scenario. Why Investors Are Looking Toward This Model Right Now The market narrative is shifting. Investors are no longer chasing volatility for its own sake. They are prioritizing real yield, transparent structure and projects tied to tangible economic activity. RentStac combines a low entry price, a legally compliant structure and a model directly linked to rental revenue. This places RNS among a small group of tokens under 0.03 dollars that offer a measurable, data-driven growth path instead of emotional trading cycles. With the presale still active and the final phase set at 0.055 dollars, many investors view this window as one of the last chances to enter before the market’s next structural shift.

Social Media Is Shifting Attention To Bitcoin According to data from analytics firm Santiment, social media talk has recently become more concentrated on Bitcoin. The indicator of relevance here is the “Social Dominance,” which measures the percentage of cryptocurrency-related discussions on social media that a given asset accounts for. Related Reading: Solana Air Gap: Analyst Says No Major Support Level Until $24 The metric gauges social media talk using the Social Volume indicator, which tracks the total number of posts/threads/comments that contain unique mentions of the coin. To give a relative measure, the Social Dominance takes the Social Volume of the asset and compares it against the combined Social Volume of the top 100 digital assets. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Social Dominance for Bitcoin and a few major altcoins over the last few months: As shown in the graph above, Bitcoin Social Dominance spiked on Friday as the cryptocurrency’s price crashed. At the peak of this surge, 36.4% of all cryptocurrency-related discussions involved BTC. This was the highest that the metric had been since July 13th, when its value touched a high of 37.6%. Interestingly, this previous spike coincided with a top for the asset. Historically, digital assets have tended to move in a way that goes contrary to the expectations of the majority, so too much excitement or FUD among the retail social media crowd can act as a reversal signal. The July high in Social Dominance signaled FOMO among the traders, which could be why Bitcoin’s bullish momentum paused then. Another example of the pattern came in August, when this time Ethereum saw a surge in its Social Dominance, reaching a peak value of 19.1%. Alongside this market excitement, BTC and others hit a top again. Given that the latest spike in the indicator has come with a market crash, it’s possible that the high amount of discussions points to panic among the investors. “Though not a guaranteed crypto bottom signal, probabilities of a market reversal greatly increases when social dominance for Bitcoin surges,” explained the analytics firm. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashes To $98,000 As HODLer Selling Accelerates The Social Dominance only contains information about social media platforms. One useful way of gauging the sentiment in the sector as a whole is through Alternative‘s Fear & Greed Index, which takes into account several factors, including social media data itself. During the weekend, the Fear & Greed Index fell to a value of just 10, indicating a strong extreme fear sentiment among Bitcoin investors. The last time the index went this low was in February, and the last time it was lower was all the way back during the 2022 bear market. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $95,300, down over 10% in the last week.

Canary Capital’s XRPC fund narrowly beat Solana’s BSOL ETF, but the token itself is down 11% over the past week, showing that institutional hype hasn’t yet translated into price strength. Congrats to $XRPC for $58m in Day One volume, the most of any ETF launched this year (out of 900), BARELY edging out $BSOL 's $57m. The two of them are in league of own tho as 3rd place is over $20m away. pic.twitter.com/MjsOeceeNb — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 13, 2025 During its first day of trading, XRP attracted $58.6 million, breaking this year’s record for crypto ETFs, previously set by Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETF (BSOL). Meanwhile, in just two days, XRPC more than doubled the assets under management (AUM) of the REX-Osprey fund. According to its official website, XRPC currently manages $248 million for investors, despite the market’s latest setback. This makes it the largest XRP-linked ETF in the U.S. stock market. Similar vehicles from Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, and CoinShares are waiting for the SEC’s nod to hit the trading floor soon. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Risks a 30% Drop if It Loses This Key Support The 4-hour chart shows that XRP’s downtrend has persisted despite the launch of the ETF. The token seems to have found support temporarily at around $2.15 – $2.22. However, if this demand area falters this week, we could see XRP dropping to $1.57. This is the price level from which it bounced during the October 10 flash crash. This means a 30.4% downside risk based on where the price is today. Nonetheless, if the $2.20 support level holds, XRP could recover to $3 rapidly, especially if market sentiment improves for an end-of- year “Christmas rally.” The launch of additional ETFs could reinforce this bullish scenario, as rising institutional interest may drive demand for the token. Meanwhile, as most altcoins remain under pressure, early-stage presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are quietly gaining traction. With over $4 million raised already, the presale is gathering serious momentum as it builds a trader-first meme coin community. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Reignites the Doge Spirit with a Bold New Vision for Crypto Traders Built on Ethereum and inspired by the original Doge meme, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is more than just another meme coin; it’s a fresh take on what made Doge iconic in the first place.

In addition, traders can compete against each other for attractive rewards and bragging rights through fun tournaments like Maxi Ripped and Maxi Gainz. Up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds will also be invested in promising tokens. The resulting gains will be used to finance marketing campaigns that raise the market’s awareness of $MAXI.

Authorities Seize Millions in Crypto From Convicted Twitter Hacker Despite US Conviction This week, the UK’s Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) confirmed it had secured a civil recovery order targeting 42.378 BTC, 235.329 ETH, 143,273.57 BUSD, and 15.23 USDC linked to O’Connor, now valued at roughly £4.1 million. The assets, once worth only a fraction of that amount at the time of the hack, will be liquidated by a court-appointed trustee. O’Connor, who now lives in Spain, did not participate in the London hearing, but his mother said he was willing to forfeit all remaining interest in the funds. O’Connor pleaded guilty in the United States to a long list of offenses, including computer intrusion conspiracies, wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, extortion, threatening communications, and stalking a 16-year-old victim. He was extradited from Spain and sentenced to five years in prison before being deported earlier this year. The CPS had previously obtained a Property Freezing Order during extradition proceedings to prevent the cryptocurrency from being moved. Adrian Foster, Chief Crown Prosecutor for the CPS Proceeds of Crime Division, said the case shows that authorities will pursue criminal profits even when convictions occur overseas. “We were able to use the full force of the powers available to us to ensure that even when someone is not convicted in the UK, we are still able to ensure they do not benefit from their criminality,” he said. Bitcoin Surge Amplifies Value of Assets Stolen in 2020 Twitter Hack Bitcoin’s rise has increased the value of O’Connor’s stolen holdings. At today’s price near $92,800, almost ten times higher than in mid-2020, the remaining assets ballooned to more than £4.1 million, prosecutors said. BTC Weekly Price Chart Source: Cryptonews The Twitter breach was one of the biggest social media security failures ever recorded. X, then Twitter, briefly locked down verified accounts as the scam spread to more than 350 million users. Investigators later said two unwitting British associates opened crypto accounts used by O’Connor but were not involved in the fraud. The case arrives during a period of heightened concern over crypto-related cybercrime, with governments worldwide reporting rapid growth in sophisticated digital extortion schemes. Law enforcement agencies have also pointed out a sharp rise in crypto laundering. According to Global Ledger data cited in the filings, hackers stole more than $3 billion across 119 incidents in the first eight months of 2025 alone, already surpassing 2024’s total by 1.5 times. Meanwhile, separate enforcement actions continue internationally. In November, the US Justice Department launched efforts to seize more than $15 million in USDT tied to North Korea’s APT38 hacking unit , connected to a series of major 2023 exchange breaches. The US DOJ is seeking to seize over $15 million in USDT tied to North Korean state-backed hacking unit APT38. #NorthKorea #Crypto https://t.co/LdPBVFKOhG — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 16, 2025 Europol also dismantled a cybercrime syndicate responsible for creating more than 49 million fake online accounts , including fraudulent profiles on crypto platforms, using a large-scale SIM-farm infrastructure. Despite rising global investigations, recent data suggests the industry is experiencing short-term improvements in security. October 2025 was recorded as the safest month of the year for crypto platforms, with only $18.18 million lost to hacks, an 85% drop from September.

BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes has just dropped a bombshell analysis that explains exactly what’s happening with the cryptocurrency market. His insights reveal why we’re facing a potential Bitcoin correction in the short term, but the long-term outlook remains incredibly bullish. Why is Bitcoin Facing a Short-Term Correction? Arthur Hayes points to a critical factor that many investors are overlooking: global U.S. dollar liquidity. Since April, we’ve seen a significant contraction in dollar liquidity worldwide. This liquidity squeeze is creating downward pressure on risk assets, including Bitcoin. Previously, Bitcoin enjoyed strong support from two key sources: ETF inflows that provided consistent buying pressure Corporate treasury purchases from companies holding digital assets However, Hayes explains these supportive factors have now diminished. The basis trade – the spread between futures and spot prices – is no longer attractive enough to drive sustained institutional ETF purchases. Moreover, most digital asset treasury companies are trading below their net asset value, reducing their ability to continue accumulating Bitcoin. How Does Liquidity Impact Bitcoin Prices? Liquidity acts like oxygen for financial markets. When dollar liquidity contracts, risk assets typically struggle. Hayes emphasizes that Bitcoin is now feeling this pressure directly. The withdrawal of institutional funds has left Bitcoin exposed to the broader liquidity crunch. But here’s the crucial insight: this Bitcoin correction is temporary. Hayes compares the current situation to 2023, when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s strategic moves injected $2.5 trillion into markets through increased short-term government bond issuance. When Will the Bitcoin Correction End? Hayes provides clear triggers for when we can expect liquidity to return. He suggests watch for these market signals: S&P and Nasdaq indices falling 10-20% 10-year U.S. Treasury yield approaching 5% Government intervention to support markets Once these conditions are met, Hayes expects the Trump administration and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to adopt a dual strategy. They’ll publicly address inflation concerns while privately injecting the liquidity needed to stabilize markets. What’s the Long-Term Bitcoin Price Target? Here’s where it gets exciting. Hayes believes this Bitcoin correction sets the stage for an enormous rally later this year. He projects Bitcoin could reach between $200,000 and $250,000 by year-end once liquidity begins flowing back into the market. The current period represents what Hayes calls a “necessary, brief correction” before the major market rally. This temporary Bitcoin correction is actually healthy for the long-term bull market, shaking out weak hands and creating better entry points for serious investors. FAQs About Bitcoin Correction and Market Outlook How long will this Bitcoin correction last? Hayes suggests the correction will be relatively brief, likely ending when market conditions trigger government liquidity injections. Should I sell my Bitcoin during this correction? Hayes views this as a temporary phase before a major rally. Long-term holders might consider holding through the volatility. What are the key indicators to watch? Monitor the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and 10-year Treasury yields for signals of when liquidity might return. How high could Bitcoin go after the correction? Hayes projects $200,000 to $250,000 by year-end if liquidity returns as expected. What’s driving the liquidity squeeze? Global dollar liquidity has been contracting since April, reducing support for risk assets like Bitcoin. Are institutional investors still buying Bitcoin? ETF inflows have slowed as the basis trade became less attractive, reducing institutional support temporarily. Share this crucial market analysis with fellow crypto enthusiasts!

The likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana have suffered minor drops today, on top of significant falls in the last seven days, with BTC actually down for the year at one point today. However, token fundamentals haven’t changed at all, and it’s likely that most major coins will make a big comeback once sentiment improves. Meanwhile, new and up-and-coming tokens have the potential to outpace the market, with the incoming launch of ERC-20 crypto PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) showing some real potential for gains. Best New Meme Coin to Buy Today – 17 November PEPENODE opened its presale in September, and has since gone on to raise $2.1 million from enthusiastic investors. The PEPENODE presale is live. Buy Nodes. Build Your Server Room. Combine Nodes For Huge Bonuses. Do it all here https://t.co/d1JAronqiv pic.twitter.com/60uLhEoukP — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 10, 2025 While the coin has assumed familiar memes, what sets it apart from the crowd is its unique mine-to-earn platform, which could see users earning significant rewards. The aim of this platform is to provide users with the ability to mine coins, without having to invest in expensive and resource-hungry hardware. Instead, users can build and run their own virtual mining rigs, using PEPENODE tokens to buy more virtual nodes. The more nodes they own, the greater their rewards will be. PEPENODE will pay out such rewards in external coins such as Pepe and Fartcoin, providing a strong incentive to engage with the platform. Not only that, but this system provides a strong incentive to accumulate more PEPENODE, given that you’ll need the coin to acquire more nodes. As such, the new token could experience significant and growing demand, which will gain a boost from the ability to stake it for a passive income. In fact, PEPENODE is currently paying out yields of 597% APY, making it a hugely profitable token to hold. How to Join the PEPENODE Presale Before It’s Too Late This explains why PEPENODE is the best new meme coin to buy today, with investors able to join its presale by going to its official website. The token is currently available to buy at a price of $0.00115, although this will rise again later today. It will continue to rise at intervals until the sale ends, so interested traders should act sooner rather than later. Given its tokenomics and fundamentals, it has the potential to rise strongly once it lists in the coming weeks. This should be the case even if the market remains in an uncertain condition, although it could absolutely rocket if things take a more bullish turn.

Here’s the Total Position Size,https://timestabloid.com/top-trader-opens-massive-xrp-short-heres-the-total-position-size/,"Market sentiment deteriorated further over the weekend as cryptocurrency prices continued to weaken, prompting several high-risk traders to open sizable leveraged short positions across multiple digital assets. Data from the analytics platform Lookonchain indicates that a well-known high-volume bettor associated with Roobet and Stake.com initiated a new series of strongly leveraged short positions involving Bitcoin, XRP, and Zcash. According to the publicly available figures, the trader activated positions totaling approximately $196 million in notional value. The allocation involved 40x leverage for Bitcoin, 20x for XRP, and 10x for Zcash. The breakdown includes 1,555.56 BTC ($148.5 million), 12.34 million XRP ($27.4 million), and 31,016 ZEC ($20.4 million). These positions were opened during a period when Bitcoin temporarily fell to $92,900, coinciding with the Fear & Greed Index dropping to 10, a level not observed since 2022.

The token has recorded a weekly decline of more than 0.64%, trading near $2.16 despite the recent introduction of multiple XRP-based exchange-traded funds . Several market participants have argued that XRP remains mispriced relative to its fundamentals and that further corrections are likely. A prominent trader known as Crashius Clay reiterated his earlier views, forecasting that XRP could reach $0.20. He stated that, in his view, the asset would still be overvalued even at that level. His concerns focus on reduced retail participation, weakening demand, and rising competition from stablecoins. He also cited the declining performance of the XRP/BTC pair, noting that the pair’s current trend indicates deteriorating relative strength against Bitcoin. Consistency With Previous Critiques Clay’s renewed warnings reflect comments he made in October when he described XRP as one of the most compelling short positions of the current market cycle. In his earlier assessment, he asserted that structural changes in global payments had limited the asset’s original value proposition. He referenced developments involving stablecoins, emerging central bank digital currency initiatives, and SWIFT’s blockchain-based shared ledger, which has support from financial institutions such as JPMorgan and HSBC. According to him, these developments reduce the likelihood that XRP will gain a central role in global settlement systems. Clay has previously disclosed successful trades involving XRP shorts. Earlier this year, he reported shorting positions totaling $1 million, which he claimed produced more than $800,000 in gains during a significant market drawdown. He has also referred to XRP as one of the most straightforward short opportunities he has encountered in his trading activity.

Supporters emphasize Ripple’s ongoing efforts to expand internationally, its partnerships with financial institutions, and the continued rollout of regulated investment products such as spot ETFs. Several analysts continue to argue that XRP could reach valuations between $8 and $10 before the end of the year. However, this perspective remains highly debated in current market conditions. The opposing views between leveraged traders and long-term supporters highlight the increasing uncertainty surrounding XRP’s price trajectory, with near-term volatility likely to remain elevated as macroeconomic factors and market liquidity continue to shift.

The landscape has dramatically shifted from optimistic to cautious as BTC’s sharp decline to $91,000 sends shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community. This sudden reversal in market sentiment has left both traders and analysts scrambling to understand what comes next for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Why Are Bitcoin Prediction Markets Turning Bearish? The recent market movement has fundamentally changed how prediction markets view Bitcoin’s future trajectory. According to Coindesk reports, platforms like Polymarket have completely abandoned their previous bullish scenarios. Instead, they now describe the current situation as a potential structural collapse that could reshape the market cycle. This shift represents a significant departure from earlier optimism. Prediction markets now anticipate gradual declines rather than the sharp recovery many had hoped for. The breach of key technical levels, including the 50-week moving average, has triggered this reassessment among market participants. What Do Trading Firms Say About This Market Shift? Major trading firms echo the concerns emerging from Bitcoin prediction markets. QCP Capital openly admitted they were unprepared for Bitcoin’s drop below the critical $100,000 threshold. The firm characterized this movement as an inflection point that traders are still processing. Key factors driving this sentiment shift include: Breach of the 50-week moving average Loss of psychological $100,000 support Changing institutional positioning Revised technical analysis scenarios How Are Prediction Markets Adjusting Their Forecasts? Bitcoin prediction markets are now recalibrating their year-end price expectations. Polymarket’s abrupt reversal demonstrates how quickly sentiment can change in cryptocurrency markets. The platform now projects a gradual downtrend rather than expecting immediate recovery. This adjustment in Bitcoin prediction markets reflects deeper concerns about market structure. Analysts are watching whether this represents a temporary correction or the beginning of a more sustained bearish phase. The data from these markets provides valuable insights into collective market intelligence. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Investors? The changing signals from Bitcoin prediction markets suggest investors should prepare for increased volatility. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, the current data points toward more cautious positioning. However, experienced traders know that market sentiment can shift rapidly. Important considerations for investors include: Diversification across different time horizons Risk management strategies Monitoring multiple data sources beyond prediction markets Understanding that markets often overreact in both directions Will Bitcoin Prediction Markets Regain Their Bullish Stance? The future direction of Bitcoin prediction markets depends on several factors. Market participants will closely watch for stabilization above key support levels and institutional flow patterns. Historical data shows that prediction markets can quickly revert to bullish outlooks when fundamental conditions improve. Currently, the consensus from Bitcoin prediction markets suggests patience is warranted. The structural concerns raised by recent price action need time to resolve. Meanwhile, traders should monitor these markets for early signs of sentiment shifts. Conclusion: Navigating the New Market Reality The dramatic reversal in Bitcoin prediction markets serves as a powerful reminder of cryptocurrency volatility. While the shift from bullish to bearish outlook may concern some investors, it also creates opportunities for those who understand market cycles. The current reassessment provides valuable data points for making informed decisions in these unpredictable markets. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin prediction markets? Bitcoin prediction markets are platforms where traders can bet on future cryptocurrency prices and events, providing collective intelligence about market expectations. Why did prediction markets turn bearish? Prediction markets turned bearish after Bitcoin broke below $100,000 and its 50-week moving average, signaling potential structural changes in the market cycle. How reliable are prediction market forecasts? While prediction markets aggregate crowd wisdom, they’re not infallible and should be used alongside other analysis tools for comprehensive market understanding. What time frame do prediction markets consider? Most Bitcoin prediction markets focus on short to medium-term forecasts, typically ranging from weeks to several months ahead. Can prediction markets quickly become bullish again? Yes, prediction markets can rapidly shift sentiment based on new market data, regulatory developments, or changing institutional flows.

In that filing, Larry and Sergey told investors who shaped their thinking, where their ideas came from, when they learned from them, why they used that model, and which document guided their structure. The two men titled their founders’ letter “An Owner’s Manual for Google’s Shareholders,” and added a footnote saying much of the letter was inspired by Warren’s essays in Berkshire Hathaway’s annual reports and Berkshire’s own manual. Buffett shows his admiration with a major Alphabet stake The story circled back more than two decades later, when Berkshire Hathaway disclosed late Friday who made a new investment, where the money went, when the filing was completed, why it matters for the company’s strategy, and which filing confirmed it. The document revealed that Berkshire now owns a stake worth about $4.3 billion in Alphabet, making it the firm’s 10th biggest equity holding. That news pushed Alphabet shares up 3% on Monday, as trading desks reacted to a rare tech position from a company that usually stays far away from fast‑growth names. This is the first time Berkshire is known to hold a position in Google, which is unusual because Warren has avoided the sector for most of his investing life. The timing stands out too: Warren, now 95, is stepping down as CEO at the end of this year, with Greg Abel preparing to take over. This means the Alphabet stake will be part of Berkshire’s portfolio as leadership shifts. The regret has been on record for years. In 2017, Warren said he should have bought Google long before, especially because Geico, the Berkshire‑owned insurer, was paying large advertising bills to Google’s network. He also said he missed Amazon, which Berkshire finally bought in 2019 and still holds roughly $2.2 billion of. Google’s financial strength forces Berkshire to pay attention The buying interest came during a year when Alphabet shares rose 50%, sitting just below their all‑time high reached last week. The company reported its first $100 billion quarter in the third period, driven by Google Cloud, which handles the firm’s artificial intelligence tools.The cloud unit holds a $155 billion backlog, showing long‑term customer commitments. Alphabet also rolled out new chips for its AI services, which puts it in the same field as companies racing to build advanced hardware for AI workloads. Even with strong results, Alphabet trades cheaper than most AI‑focused giants. The stock sits at 26 times next year’s earnings, while Microsoft trades at 32, Broadcom at 51 and Nvidia at 42. Those numbers explain why investors say Alphabet still looks less expensive than its competitors. The financial rise of Larry and Sergey reflects Google’s growth. Forbes lists them seventh and eighth on its billionaires ranking. Warren sits at sixth, putting all three close together on the global wealth list. The IPO prospectus showed how deeply Warren influenced Google’s foundation. Larry and Sergey wrote that outside pressure often pushes companies to give up long‑term plans for short‑term numbers.

But tonight, we’re going to introduce him to you as the newest AI bear on the Street. When I first heard about Peter’s decision to dump the entirety of his Nvidia holdings, I instantly realized that it made sense. There was no confusion. This is a man who has been investing since the 90s and has seen more market cycles than this author has seen birthdays, yet he walked away from a company Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and Washington have all been worshipping all year, and the 13F filing showed he did it right after Nvidia crossed $5 trillion. Anyway, the 13F filing also showed Pete cutting Tesla by more than 76%, though the EV giant is still his biggest holding at the end of September, according to InsiderScore. The stock rallied by 40% in Q3, has dropped more than 7% so far this quarter, and is barely up 3% for the year. Yet, he kept over 20% of it anyway. Meanwhile, he added over $25 million in Microsoft and more than $20 million in Apple, which says a lot, because this man doesn’t usually hide inside megacaps unless he wants insulation. The funny part is that everyone acts surprised. But if you look at Peter’s history, you shouldn’t be. He has always cut when people get euphoric. And he has always bet where he believes power shifts next. Or where he plans to shift it behind the scenes, if you know what I mean. A look into Peter’s rewired portfolio Peter’s portfolio has always been weirdly fascinating. Since the 90s, the guy has loaded up on tech, crypto, recently healthcare, and almost nothing from Europe, which is quite odd for a man who has been on Wall Street this long. He was early in Facebook, early in Palantir, early in Bitcoin and Ethereum, early in crazy national-security startups no one had ever heard of until they showed up in congressional hearings. He was never the “buy the S&P” type. He puts his money where disruption happens, or where he thinks civilization needs pressure points. As of press time, Palantir is 77.86% of Peter’s entire portfolio , worth $17.459 billion across 100,335,000 shares. The second-largest holding is Airbnb, worth $3.24 billion at 14.45%, followed by Affirm at $1.275 billion with 5.69%. After that comes healthcare for Peter. He holds Oscar Health ( worth$299.834 million), AbCellera ($52.99 million), BlackSky ($30.713 million), Invivyd ($26.418 million), Chemomab ($15.05 million), a tiny slice of Meta ($8.467 million), and Fractyl Health ($8.079 million). He built Founders Fund in 2005 with Sean Parker, Ken Howery, and Luke Nosek. Later, they pumped money into hypersensitive national-security firms like Palantir, Anduril, and General Matter. They even have a plan to bring ultraviolet lithography production onshore. Inside his circle, the fund is literally nicknamed “the Precious.” Pater has put cash into everything from Airbnb, Spotify, Quora, Nanotronics, Stripe, SpaceX, PsiQuantum, Rigetti, Bullish Global, and ResearchGate. In 2017, Founders Fund threw $15–20 million into Bitcoin, and by early 2018, those holdings had climbed into the hundreds of millions. He also backed Clearview AI, which made headlines for reasons everyone remembers. Since 2024, Founders Fund has incubated Valinor Enterprises, invested $85 million into SentientAGI to challenge OpenAI and Perplexity, and funded Impulse Space, Ramp, and Crusoe. In 2025, they added Erebor, EnduroSat, Varda, and Hadrian. The man has been betting on everything from satellites to quantum computing to space medicine. Thiel seemingly sides with Altman against Elon Musk with Nvidia somehow a part of it The other force shaping this whole thing is the increasingly interesting Sam Altman. As you may know, Sammy and Elon Musk have been snapping at each other for years. They co-founded OpenAI in 2015, but Elon had to leave in 2018, and they’ve been throwing shots ever since. OpenAI and xAI compete directly now. Sam wants OpenAI public in 2027, and Wall Street expects the IPO to be huge. In the meantime, Sam likes to rage bait Elon on his own platform X, with posts that seem purposefully aimed to enact a reaction out of Elon completely unprovoked. Meanwhile, Sam and Peter get along pretty well. Sam has called him a mentor multiple times and has received “advice” from him on how to run OpenAI since as far back as 2017. Elon and Peter, on the other hand, have quite a messy history. They worked together at PayPal, but Peter and his allies pushed Elon out while he was on his honeymoon. One source said Elon sees Peter as “a sociopath.” Peter sees Elon as “a fraud.” Elon never trusted him again after that. An investor who has attended their shareholder events would tell you their personalities never matched. See Elon is loud and impulsive, while Peter is quiet and calculated. Basically, Elon bets the house and Peter plays defense. Peter’s exit followed SoftBank’s massive offload and came at a point when Michael Burry was taking huge put positions against Nvidia and Palantir. James Anderson flat-out said Nvidia’s proposed $100 billion financing idea for OpenAI was “disconcerting.” As surprising as it may be also, Jensen Huang is a part of this too. The Nvidia CEO has been cosying up to Elon in public, something he only does with people he is really close with (there have been very few). Jensen and Elon now hype each other on X, speak kindly about each other in interviews, and have mentioned each other in at least 2 earnings calls this year. The author of this article believes that what we’re seeing is two alliances forming. On one side, Peter and Sam. On the other, Jensen and Elon.

That’s exactly what institutions have been doing with stablecoins, according to Aleo’s groundbreaking new report. The stablecoin privacy gap has reached alarming proportions, exposing massive financial flows to public scrutiny. What is the Stablecoin Privacy Gap? Aleo’s ‘Stablecoin Privacy Gap Report 2025’ reveals a stunning disconnect in institutional cryptocurrency behavior. While institutions transferred $1.22 trillion in stablecoins over two years, they completely avoided privacy protocols. This massive stablecoin privacy oversight means every transaction remained publicly visible on blockchain explorers. The report highlights how traditional financial institutions have carried their transparency requirements into the crypto space. However, this approach creates significant security and competitive disadvantages. Meanwhile, only $624 million in stablecoins entered privacy protocols during the same period, with zero institutional participation. Why Are Institutions Avoiding Stablecoin Privacy? Several factors explain this surprising stablecoin privacy avoidance. Regulatory uncertainty remains the primary concern. Many institutions fear that using privacy tools might trigger compliance issues or regulatory scrutiny. Regulatory concerns about using privacy-enhancing technologies Lack of institutional-grade privacy solutions until recently Compliance requirements that prioritize transparency Limited understanding of available stablecoin privacy options Moreover, dedicated stablecoin privacy rails for institutions only began emerging this year. The infrastructure simply wasn’t available for large-scale institutional use until now. Emerging Solutions for Stablecoin Privacy The landscape is rapidly changing with new stablecoin privacy solutions entering the market. PayPal’s PYUSD now offers confidential transfer features, while Paxos launched USAD, a privacy-focused stablecoin. These developments signal a major shift in institutional stablecoin privacy approaches. Aleo predicts that institutional funds will begin migrating to these new stablecoin privacy rails in the coming months. The report suggests that once the first major institutions adopt these solutions, others will quickly follow to maintain competitive parity. What Does This Mean for Crypto Adoption? The stablecoin privacy gap represents both a challenge and opportunity for broader cryptocurrency adoption. Institutions need privacy for legitimate business reasons, including protecting trade strategies and client information. Without proper stablecoin privacy solutions, mainstream adoption faces significant hurdles. However, the emergence of compliant stablecoin privacy tools could accelerate institutional participation. When institutions can balance transparency requirements with necessary privacy protections, we’ll likely see increased stablecoin adoption across traditional finance. The Future of Stablecoin Privacy Aleo’s report concludes that we’re standing at the brink of a major transformation in stablecoin privacy practices. The coming year will likely see billions, potentially trillions, migrating to privacy-enhanced stablecoin solutions. This shift will fundamentally change how institutions interact with digital assets. The stablecoin privacy revolution isn’t just coming—it’s already begun, with major financial players preparing to adopt these new technologies. Frequently Asked Questions What is stablecoin privacy? Stablecoin privacy refers to technologies that conceal transaction details while maintaining regulatory compliance, allowing institutions to protect sensitive financial information. Why do institutions need stablecoin privacy? Institutions require stablecoin privacy to protect trade strategies, client information, and competitive advantages while meeting compliance obligations. Are privacy features compliant with regulations? New stablecoin privacy solutions like PYUSD confidential transfers are designed specifically to meet regulatory requirements while providing necessary privacy protections. When will institutions adopt privacy features? Aleo predicts large-scale migration to stablecoin privacy rails will begin within the coming months as more institutional-grade solutions become available. What are the risks of not using privacy features? Without stablecoin privacy, institutions expose transaction patterns, amounts, and counterparties to competitors and potential bad actors. Which stablecoins offer privacy features? Currently, PayPal’s PYUSD and Paxos’s USAD lead in institutional stablecoin privacy features, with more solutions expected soon.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has struggled to regain bullish momentum, currently hovering near $3,150 after weeks of consistent selling pressure. However, new on-chain data from CryptoQuant reveals that Ethereum might be nearing a crucial accumulation zone — one historically associated with long-term holder activity and market bottoms. Related Reading: Massive Bitcoin Bid Walls Spotted On Binance: Bulls Step In With 2,800 BTC Cluster According to the report, the ETH price is now just 8% away from touching the Accumulation Addresses Realized Price level at $2,895. This metric represents the average cost basis of long-term investors who have been steadily stacking ETH during previous market cycles. A move toward this level could signal the final stages of the ongoing correction, potentially attracting renewed interest from strategic buyers looking for value entries. Historically, similar declines toward the realized price of accumulation addresses have acted as strong support zones, leading to price stabilization and subsequent recoveries. While short-term sentiment remains fearful, the proximity to this key level suggests that Ethereum could soon reach a point where long-term investors begin accumulating once again — setting the stage for a potential market rebound. Long-Term Holders Stay Unshaken According to CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci, the $2,895 level represents the average cost basis of long-term Ethereum accumulators — investors who have been “patiently stacking” through multiple market cycles. This group tends to buy during periods of maximum fear, forming a stable foundation for future rallies. Historically, Ethereum has only dipped below this key level once, during the April 2025 Trump tax-tariff crisis, when global markets faced extreme uncertainty. The Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (GEPUCURRENT) surged to 629 points, surpassing even the COVID-19 pandemic peak by 50%. Despite the widespread panic, long-term holders continued to accumulate aggressively rather than sell. In fact, 2025 saw around 17 million ETH flow into accumulation addresses, raising the total balance held by these wallets from 10 million to over 27 million ETH. This trend highlights the conviction of Ethereum’s strongest investors, who have repeatedly viewed fear-driven sell-offs as opportunities. If Ethereum were to decline another 8%, it would reach this cost basis once again. Historically, this level has acted as one of the strongest long-term accumulation zones, signaling value and resilience. As Kesmeci notes, even if ETH briefly dips below $2,900, it’s unlikely to remain there for long. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Expands Position By 36,437 ETH – Bringing Total To $1.34B Ethereum Holds Above Key Support as Market Tests Long-Term Confidence Ethereum’s weekly chart shows that the asset is holding above a key structural support zone near $3,000, after several weeks of downside pressure. The price briefly dipped below this level last week but recovered quickly, forming a potential short-term base around the 200-week moving average — a historically significant line that has supported major bottoms in past cycles. Currently trading around $3,190, ETH is attempting to maintain stability within this critical range. The 50-week moving average remains slightly above at $3,500, serving as immediate resistance. A break above that level would be an early signal of renewed bullish momentum, while losing $3,000 could trigger a deeper correction toward $2,800–$2,900, which aligns closely with the Accumulation Realized Price highlighted by CryptoQuant analysts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Leverage Cooldown Signals Market Reset: OI Drops 21% As Excess Risk Is Flushed Out The recent decline mirrors past phases of market reset, such as the April 2025 correction, where Ethereum similarly tested long-term supports before rebounding strongly.

54549999,629257,1763431241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54549999.jpeg,Bitcoin Bear Market: Confirmed Or False Alarm? Experts Sound Off,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bear-market-confirmed-or-false-alarm/,"Bitcoin’s drop back into the mid-$90,000s has reignited the debate: is this the start of a true bear market, or a sharp reset inside an ongoing uptrend? Analysts are converging on the same battleground levels but differ on what they imply. Has The Bitcoin Bear Market Arrived? Macro swing-trader “The Great Mattsby” (@matthughes13) argues that, structurally, Bitcoin is still tracking a familiar pattern. He reminds followers that: “Back in 2024, BTC consolidated for 7 months in the $70k-$50k zone before breaking out.” Using monthly Fibonacci retracements from the March 2024 high to the November 2022 low, he notes that Bitcoin previously tagged the 0.618 retracement at $51,518, “even wicked below, then bounced.” On a fresh set of fibs drawn from the October 2025 top to the August 2024 low, that same key level now sits at $96,975. Price is currently trading slightly below it, similar to the 2024 wick. With two weeks left in November, Mattsby stresses that the close matters more than the intramonth volatility: “If BTC holds this $96-$97k zone for a monthly candle close in November, this could mirror last year’s setup: a couple more months retesting this zone, then a run to new all-time highs would be possible.” On the weekly timeframe, however, market analyst Rekt Capital is less comfortable with the latest breakdown. For him, the 50-week exponential moving average has been a core “bullish structure” of this cycle. He writes: “Bear Markets confirm when the bullish structures that supported continued bullish momentum start to fail.” His chart shows the current weekly candle pushing decisively below the 50-week EMA, which has previously acted as support. He sees “a high probability the Weekly Candle Closes below the 50-week EMA,” adding that the reaction in the coming weeks will be “macro trend-defining.” The key question, in his view: “Can BTC produce enough upside in the coming weeks to invalidate this Weekly Close below the 50 EMA and reclaim the EMA as support?” What Bitcoin On-Chain Data Says On-chain data sends a different signal. Analyst Frank (@FrankAFetter) shared Checkonchain’s Short-Term Holder MVRV chart , which tracks the profitability of recent buyers relative to their cost basis with standard-deviation bands. Bitcoin’s latest flush has driven the metric to the lower, negative-one-standard-deviation band, a zone previously tagged near $49,000 and $74,000 before meaningful bounces. Frank’s approach is straightforward: “I’m a buyer of standard deviation moves to the downside; they don’t come often, but they tend to be excellent opportunities.” Is The CryptoQuant CEO Right Again? CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju focuses on who is selling this dip. He characterizes the move as internal rotation among long-term players rather than broad distribution: “This dip is just long-term holders rotating among themselves. Old Bitcoiners are selling to tradfi players, who will also hold for the long run.” He recalls that his earlier top call was driven by “OG whales … dumping hard,” but argues that the landscape has shifted: “ETFs, MSTR, and other new channels kept injecting fresh liquidity. Onchain inflows are still strong. This dip is basically OG whales dragging the market.” Looking ahead, he points to “ sovereign funds , pension funds, multi-asset funds, and corporate treasuries” as building even larger, persistent liquidity channels and concludes: “The cycle theory is dead until these liquidity channels stop running.” Notably, Ki Young Ju correctly predicted in March this year that Bitcoin could see a “6–12 months of bearish or sideways price action.” In short, the technical picture has clearly weakened, with the 50-week EMA and the $96,000–$97,000 monthly Fibonacci zone now acting as critical lines in the sand. If Bitcoin can reclaim the weekly EMA and secure a monthly close above that 0.618 retracement, the case for this being a deep but standard consolidation remains credible. A sustained failure at these levels, by contrast, would lend significant weight to the bear-market argument. For now, the verdict hinges on how the next few weekly and monthly candles close, not on the intraday noise.

The filing said the conflict began when Broadcom told Fidelity it would end its access to the VMware tools after January 21, a move Fidelity said could shut down trading, block customers from their accounts, and break the systems its workers use each day. Fidelity said it filed the action because it believes Broadcom is ignoring a contract that came with VMware long before Broadcom bought the company. Fidelity challenges Broadcom over VMware access The lawsuit said VMware’s virtualization software has powered Fidelity’s virtual servers since 2005, and the company said it built most of its internal and customer-facing systems on top of that setup. Fidelity said the software became central to how it handles account access, trade execution, and everyday service for its nearly 50 million customers. Fidelity explained that this fight began in 2023 when Broadcom completed its purchase of VMware and changed the entire product lineup. The filing said Broadcom took the older VMware tools and rebuilt them into new bundles that cost far more than the separate products Fidelity used for years. Fidelity said that when it tried to renew its old subscription, Broadcom refused to honor the VMware contract. Fidelity said Broadcom pushed it to buy the new bundle instead of the tools it already used, which the company said would change its tech setup in a way that made no sense for its systems. Fidelity argued that losing access on the date Broadcom first gave, December 22, would have made it impossible to keep its platforms running. Fidelity’s filing said the company told the court it would need at least 18 to 24 months to move to a new setup because of how deeply VMware runs through its servers. The filing said Broadcom later agreed to extend the cutoff to January 21, giving the judge time to hear the case. Fidelity said this delay helps only for now, because the threat to its operations still stands if access ends.

This groundbreaking development marks a significant milestone for Solana investors and the broader crypto market. The SOL spot ETF represents a major step forward in institutional cryptocurrency adoption. What Makes the SOL Spot ETF So Important? The launch of a SOL spot ETF opens up new investment avenues for both retail and institutional investors. Unlike futures-based products, a spot ETF directly holds the underlying asset. This means investors gain actual exposure to Solana’s price movements without the complexities of managing private keys or navigating crypto exchanges. James Seyffart’s announcement carries substantial weight in the financial community. As a respected Bloomberg analyst, his insights often signal important market movements. The expected SOL spot ETF launch could trigger increased institutional interest in Solana and potentially influence its market position. How Will the SOLC ETF Benefit Investors? The introduction of this SOL spot ETF brings several advantages to the table. First, it provides regulatory clarity and institutional-grade security. Second, it offers easier access for traditional investors who prefer regulated financial products. Third, it could enhance Solana’s liquidity and market stability. Regulated access to Solana investments Enhanced security through established financial institutions Simplified trading on traditional stock exchanges Tax advantages for certain investment accounts What Challenges Might the SOL Spot ETF Face? Despite the excitement, potential challenges remain. Regulatory scrutiny continues to shape the crypto ETF landscape. Market volatility could affect early trading, and competition from other crypto ETFs might influence performance. However, the overall sentiment appears positive given the growing acceptance of cryptocurrency investment products. The timing of this SOL spot ETF launch coincides with increasing institutional interest in alternative cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. This development could position Solana as a more mainstream investment option and potentially drive broader adoption of the Solana blockchain ecosystem. Why Should You Pay Attention to This Launch? Tomorrow’s expected SOL spot ETF launch represents more than just another financial product. It signals growing institutional confidence in Solana’s technology and long-term potential. For investors, this could mean new opportunities to diversify crypto portfolios through regulated channels. The success of previous cryptocurrency ETFs suggests strong demand for such products. If the SOL spot ETF follows similar patterns, it could attract significant investment flows and potentially influence Solana’s price discovery mechanism. This makes tomorrow’s launch a crucial event for crypto market watchers. Final Thoughts on the SOL Spot ETF Opportunity The anticipated launch of Canary’s SOL spot ETF tomorrow marks a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency adoption. It bridges the gap between traditional finance and digital assets while providing investors with regulated exposure to Solana’s growth potential. As the crypto landscape continues evolving, such developments demonstrate the increasing maturity and institutional acceptance of blockchain technologies. Frequently Asked Questions What is a SOL spot ETF? A SOL spot ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Solana tokens, allowing investors to gain exposure to SOL’s price movements without owning the cryptocurrency directly. When will the SOLC ETF be available for trading? According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, the SOL spot ETF is expected to launch tomorrow, though exact trading times may vary by brokerage platform. How does a spot ETF differ from a futures ETF? A spot ETF holds the actual underlying asset (SOL tokens), while a futures ETF holds contracts that derive their value from future price expectations of the asset.

54550504,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=863011,1763431552,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54550504.jpeg,Crypto firm LevelField wins regulatory nod to acquire Burling Bank,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/levelfield-to-acquire-burling-bank/,"LevelField Financial, a digital-asset fintech company, got conditional approval from the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) to acquire Chicago’s Burling Bank, according to the company’s announcement on Monday. If approved, the deal would transform Burling Bank into LevelField Bank, a fully FDIC-insured banking service offering both traditional and crypto-integrated banking services in all U.S. states and territories. Gene A. Grant II, CEO of LevelField Financial, stated that obtaining approval marked a significant milestone for LevelField and represented a crucial step in introducing crypto services to regulated banking. He also stated that the company remains committed to stringent supervisory standards while increasing access to digital assets for users and companies. Despite receiving approval from the Illinois regulator, the fintech company is still waiting for confirmation from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to become a bank holding company. After the last step is completed, LevelField Bank can fully operate in accordance with federal banking rules, while also introducing digital assets into its products. Burling Bank is a relatively small commercial bank holding around $196 million in net assets and $158 million in customer deposits, according to Visbanking data. LevelField plans to utilize the bank’s foundation to develop a cutting-edge digital crypto-banking platform. LevelField plans 24/7 crypto banking LevelField Bank wants to integrate its traditional and digital assets into a single, 24/7 banking service. Soon enough, customers could eventually gain access to Bitcoin-backed loans , credit, and debit cards that reward users with Bitcoin, as well as services such as digital-asset trading and custody. In particular, the bank will focus on underbanked industries, including small businesses and sectors with limited access to conventional banking services. Grant II stated that all services will be underpinned by U.S. banking rules, providing a level of both security and legal oversight not available to many standalone crypto companies. LevelField has some analysts seeing its shift as a step toward American bank governance and the possibility that it will be the first fully regulated, FDIC-insured, chartered bank in the U.S. to introduce cryptographic services nationwide. It also follows a pattern set by many fintechs to bridge the gap between digital assets and mainstream financial institutions. LevelField pushes forward after the previous withdrawal LevelField first applied to acquire Burling Bank in February 2023 but withdrew its application in February 2024. The company submitted a second application in December 2024, which has now received conditional approval. Industry analysts said that the regulatory approval heralds a change in the rules governing crypto banking. Previous crypto-friendly banks, such as Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank , and Signature Bank, which had all gone bankrupt earlier this year, had prompted regulators to adopt a cautious approach to crypto adoption. LevelField’s methodical style of working — and its compliance with supervisory processes — may have given regulators some peace of mind that it is capable of connecting crypto and conventional banking safely. That purchase puts LevelField at the intersection of traditional finance and crypto innovation. And it’s a world where digital assets can exist alongside insured banks, thereby facilitating the greater adoption of cryptocurrencies. The sale is also indicative of broader market concerns. U.S. banking groups have warned that widespread investment in yield-bearing stablecoins could wipe out deposits from conventional banks and might ultimately take $6.6 trillion from the banking system, according to U.S. Treasury estimates as of April 2025. LevelField may offer a safer product to anyone who wants exposure to other digital assets and keeps funds within the insured banking chain.

The meme coin has rebounded sharply from a heavy-volume flush over the weekend while Shiba Inu broke key support before staging an aggressive intraday reversal. Despite broad risk-off sentiment with FUD surrounding the U.S. macro narrative, Dogecoin reinforced a key support trendline with a bounce from $0.155. The difference is smart money. DOGE has seen an uptick in institutional interest with ETF speculation, reflected by two weeks of heavy whale positioning. 4.72 billion Dogecoin $DOGE bought by whales in the last two weeks! pic.twitter.com/9XGweARtBj — Ali (@ali_charts) November 12, 2025 Whales’ move to retake positions after weeks of downside could be a testament to a potential bottom and the turning point for the next bull run, starting with Dogecoin. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Next Bull Market Starts Now? The bounce represents the start of a potential launchpad move, forming a potential double bottom reversal alongside the previous bounce around $0.155 at the start of the month. DOGE / USD 1-day chart, double bottom fuels ascending channel pattern. Source: TradingView. This support trendline contributes to a wider ascending channel and a potential breakout setup as momentum indicators find their footing. The RSI has formed a higher low after a bounce from oversold conditions at 30, while the MACD currently oscillates closely around the signal line. While FUD prevails, bullish momentum is building. A fully realized double bottom could flip a past resistance into support at $0.20, creating a higher and stronger footing for a breakout push. Once completed, a channel breakout opens the door for a 215% push to past highs around $0.50. But with Bitwise and Greyscale spot DOGE ETFs expected before year-end, fresh TradFi exposure could fuel a 525% push to $1 running into 2026. Still, with momentum indicators still weighed down by broader market FUD, a breakdown remains credible. The next price floor sits around $0.09—a 40% decline. Maxi Doge: A Better Bet Than DOGE And SHIB? Meme coin rotations are as consistent as they are powerful. When one market leader hits a ceiling, capital naturally flows to the next high-upside contender. Every bull run eventually delivers a new parabolic Doge-themed runner. Shiba Inu carried the torch from Dogecoin in 2021, then Floki, Bonk, Dogwifhat, and most recently, Neiro. That dynamic could now be playing out with Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , an early Doge-themed token gaining traction just as SHIB and DOGE grapple with liquidity issues. The hype is already translating into numbers. The $MAXI presale has almost $4.1 million , while early backers are earning up to 76% APY through staking rewards. For those who missed out on Doge waves before, MaxiDoge could represent the next chance to catch a meme coin breakout before it takes off.

In a message to users on Monday, founders Skirmantas Januskas and Dunica Dragos said they will begin winding down the site and associated services in the coming days, including the tracking of blockchains and decentralized applications. They added that details about the DAO and the RADAR token will follow in community channels, with decisions still to be made and the community invited to take part in that process.

The team said its goal was to make a chaotic sector more understandable and trustworthy, and that they leave confident they were a net positive to the space. Launched in 2018, the platform became known as the World’s Dapp Store, covering more than 90 blockchains and surfacing near real-time metrics on users, transactions and volume across DeFi, NFTs, gaming and metaverse projects. Beyond rankings and dashboards, DappRadar offered portfolio tools for tokens and NFTs, discovery features such as quests and airdrops, and research content that developers, investors and academics cited across multiple languages. The founders said they worked with hundreds of blockchains and thousands of projects over seven years, as DappRadar data fed newsrooms, research papers and market analyses worldwide. Tougher Market Cycles Made Analytics Models Harder To Sustain Funding helped fuel that growth. DappRadar raised about $7.33m across two rounds, including a $5m Series A in May 2021 led by Prosus Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners, with participation from Mastercard Lighthouse, BaltCap, Blockchain Ventures, JBIC IG Partners and NordicNinja VC. Those funds went toward expanding data coverage and product features during a period when crypto adoption and speculation surged, drawing more users to dapps and to the platform’s rankings. Market conditions later turned tougher for analytics businesses tied to activity cycles, squeezing revenues and stretching costs. The founders said the decision to close was difficult, but necessary. They thanked the community, partners and investors for trust and patience, and urged others to continue building tools for decentralized application discovery. With the shutdown, one of Web3’s most recognizable data hubs exits the stage, leaving a gap for rivals and new entrants to fill as the industry searches for durable business models.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $90,957.88 on the Binance USDT market, marking a concerning downturn for investors and traders alike. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Price Decline? Market analysts point to several factors influencing the current Bitcoin price movement. The cryptocurrency market often experiences volatility, and today’s drop reflects broader market sentiment. However, it’s crucial to understand that price fluctuations are normal in the crypto space, even for established assets like Bitcoin. Several key elements typically affect Bitcoin price movements: Market sentiment and investor psychology Global economic conditions Regulatory developments Trading volume and liquidity Institutional investor activity How Significant is This Bitcoin Price Drop? While any decline in Bitcoin price below key psychological levels attracts attention, context matters. The current Bitcoin price movement represents a normal market correction rather than a catastrophic event. Historical data shows that Bitcoin has experienced numerous similar corrections throughout its history, often followed by recovery periods. However, the drop below $91,000 does indicate increased selling pressure. Traders should monitor these key levels: Immediate support: $90,000 level Resistance: $92,500-$93,000 range Critical level: $88,000 support zone What Should Investors Do About the Bitcoin Price Movement? For long-term investors, short-term Bitcoin price fluctuations shouldn’t trigger panic decisions. The fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin remains unchanged. However, traders might consider these strategies: Dollar-cost averaging during dips Setting stop-loss orders for risk management Monitoring trading volume for confirmation Watching for potential buying opportunities Is This Bitcoin Price Drop a Buying Opportunity? Many experienced traders view price corrections as potential entry points. The current Bitcoin price below $91,000 might attract buyers who missed previous opportunities. However, always conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance before making investment decisions. Remember these important principles when evaluating the Bitcoin price: Never invest more than you can afford to lose Diversify your cryptocurrency portfolio Consider both technical and fundamental analysis Maintain a long-term perspective Conclusion: Navigating the Volatile Bitcoin Price Landscape The Bitcoin price movement below $91,000 serves as a reminder of cryptocurrency market volatility. While concerning for short-term traders, long-term investors understand that such fluctuations are part of Bitcoin’s maturation process. The key is maintaining perspective, managing risk appropriately, and making informed decisions based on comprehensive analysis rather than emotional reactions to price movements. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin price drop below $91,000? The Bitcoin price decline likely results from combined factors including market sentiment shifts, profit-taking by traders, and broader economic conditions affecting cryptocurrency markets. How low could Bitcoin price go? While predictions vary, key support levels to watch include $90,000 and $88,000. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and unpredictable. Should I sell my Bitcoin now? Investment decisions should align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Many investors use dollar-cost averaging strategies during price dips rather than making emotional decisions. When will Bitcoin price recover? Market recovery timelines are uncertain. Historical patterns show Bitcoin has recovered from previous corrections, but past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Some traders view price dips as buying opportunities, but always conduct thorough research and consider your investment strategy before purchasing cryptocurrency. What factors affect Bitcoin price most? Key factors include market sentiment, regulatory news, institutional adoption, trading volume, macroeconomic conditions, and technological developments.

Here’s what followed this signal in the past. Bitcoin SSR RSI Is Giving A Buy Signal In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) for Bitcoin. The SSR is an indicator that measures how the market cap of BTC compares against the total supply of the stablecoins. Stablecoins refer to cryptocurrencies that are pegged to a fiat currency. Investors generally park their capital in the form of these assets when they want to avoid the volatility associated with BTC and other assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Social Dominance Hits 4-Month High: What It Means Such holders also usually eventually invest back into Bitcoin and company, however, exchanging away their stablecoins in favor of them once they feel the time is right. Because of this reason, the stablecoin supply is often looked at as a sort of “available buy supply” in the cryptocurrency sector. When the value of SSR is high, it means BTC’s value is high compared to the stablecoin supply. Such a trend suggests the market stablecoin buying power is low, which could be a bearish sign. On the other hand, the indicator being low implies the sector may have a high amount of dry powder available relative to the Bitcoin market cap, which can naturally be bullish. Now, here is the chart for the BTC SSR shared by the analyst that shows the trend in its Relative Strength Index (RSI) over the last couple of years: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin SSR RSI has witnessed a decline recently as the BTC spot price has crashed. This suggests that there may be a high amount of stablecoin buying power available in the market now. The indicator’s drop has been so steep that it has entered into a zone that Maartunn has flagged as pertaining to a buy signal. From the chart, it’s apparent that past instances of this signal have often coincided with some sort of bottom or led into a price surge. In a lot of the instances, however, the signal has only resulted in a temporary reversal. It now remains to be seen whether any bullish shift will follow the latest signal, and if one does, whether it will be lasting.

Movement from dormant hands is often a sign of selling. BTC Price Bearish momentum hasn’t shown any signs of stopping for Bitcoin as its price has now dropped to the $92,500 level.

54553529,629035,1763434849,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54553529.jpeg,Bitcoin Maintains 9% Edge Over ETF Realized Price Despite Market Pressure – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-maintain-etf-realized-price-market-pressure/,"Bitcoin is struggling to hold above the $95,000 level as fear spreads across the market, with traders uncertain whether the recent correction marks the beginning of a broader downtrend or just a temporary shakeout. The leading cryptocurrency has been under sustained selling pressure, wiping out months of bullish momentum and pushing sentiment toward extreme caution. Analysts remain divided on the next move. Some argue that Bitcoin could be entering the early stages of a bear market, pointing to weakening momentum and growing short-term losses among holders. Others, however, believe that this consolidation phase is setting the stage for a major recovery, with potential for a surge beyond all-time highs once market sentiment stabilizes. Despite the volatility, on-chain data offers a glimmer of strength . Bitcoin is still trading above the ETF Realized Price, according to CryptoQuant. This means that, on average, ETF investors remain in profit — a sign that institutional demand remains resilient even amid retail fear. ETF Investors Remain in Profit Despite Market Fear According to top analyst Maartunn, Bitcoin’s ETF Realized Price — the average cost basis of all spot Bitcoin ETF holders — currently stands at $86,680. Despite the recent wave of volatility and fear-driven selling, Bitcoin is still trading roughly 9% above this critical level, suggesting that most ETF investors remain in profit. This metric serves as an important gauge of institutional sentiment. The fact that Bitcoin continues to trade above ETF investors’ cost basis indicates that institutional demand remains resilient, even as retail sentiment turns bearish. Historically, when Bitcoin holds above key realized price levels during corrections, it signals underlying strength and reduces the likelihood of a prolonged bear phase. Moreover, ETF inflows have remained stable, showing that long-term holders are not panic-selling despite price weakness. These investors tend to view market dips as opportunities to accumulate rather than liquidate positions — a stark contrast to short-term traders who often react emotionally to volatility. If Bitcoin can sustain its position above the ETF Realized Price, it would reinforce this structural support and could serve as the launchpad for a recovery once broader market sentiment shifts from fear to cautious optimism. Bitcoin Finds Support Amid Heightened Market Fear The weekly Bitcoin chart shows the cryptocurrency hovering just above $95,000, attempting to stabilize after weeks of consistent selling pressure. This marks the first time since May that BTC has revisited this zone, which now acts as a crucial support level both technically and psychologically. The decline from the recent highs near $120,000 has been sharp, reflecting a shift in sentiment as fear and uncertainty dominate the market. The 50-week moving average currently sits near $94,000, and Bitcoin’s ability to remain above it could define the next market phase. Historically, this moving average has been a reliable support line during mid-cycle corrections, often signaling accumulation zones rather than the start of prolonged bear markets. Meanwhile, the 200-week moving average — a long-term structural floor — remains far below near $70,000, highlighting that Bitcoin’s macro trend remains intact. Volume data also suggests a potential capitulation phase, with recent sell pressure accompanied by rising trading activity, indicating stronger hands may be absorbing weak supply. If Bitcoin holds this range, a rebound toward $100,000–$105,000 could follow. However, losing $95K would expose the market to further downside, potentially testing lower supports before stability returns.

The past 24 hours delivered a brutal wake-up call for traders, with over $600 million evaporating from the market. This dramatic sell-off primarily targeted long positions, revealing critical insights about current market sentiment and risk exposure. What Do These Crypto Futures Liquidations Reveal? The recent crypto futures liquidations data paints a clear picture of market direction. Forced closures hit long positions disproportionately hard, indicating strong selling pressure across major cryptocurrencies. This pattern suggests traders were caught off-guard by sudden price movements. Let’s examine the breakdown by asset: Bitcoin (BTC) : $412 million liquidated with 62.65% being long positions Ethereum (ETH) : $148 million liquidated with 75.66% being long positions Solana (SOL) : $43.44 million liquidated with 83.58% being long positions Why Are Long Positions More Vulnerable to Crypto Futures Liquidations? Long positions face higher risk during sudden market downturns because traders use leverage to amplify their bets. When prices drop rapidly, margin calls trigger automatic liquidations. The current crypto futures liquidations wave demonstrates how leveraged long positions can quickly turn problematic. Several factors contributed to this situation: Over-leveraged positions seeking maximum returns Unexpected market volatility catching traders off-guard Cascading effect as initial liquidations trigger more sell-offs How Can Traders Navigate Future Crypto Futures Liquidations? Understanding crypto futures liquidations patterns helps traders develop better risk management strategies. The current data shows that SOL positions suffered the highest percentage of long liquidations, suggesting particular vulnerability in altcoin markets. Protective measures include: Setting appropriate stop-loss orders Monitoring leverage ratios carefully Diversifying across different time frames and assets What Do These Crypto Futures Liquidations Mean for Market Recovery? Major crypto futures liquidations often signal potential market turning points. While painful for affected traders, large-scale position closures can remove excess leverage from the system. This creates healthier conditions for future price movements. The market typically experiences: Reduced speculative pressure after large liquidations More stable price discovery mechanisms Opportunities for new positions at better valuations Conclusion: Learning from Crypto Futures Liquidations Data The recent crypto futures liquidations serve as a powerful reminder about market risks. While the numbers appear staggering, they represent valuable lessons about position sizing, risk management, and market timing. Smart traders will use this data to refine their strategies rather than abandon futures trading altogether. Frequently Asked Questions What triggers crypto futures liquidations? Liquidations occur when a trader’s position loses enough value that their margin can no longer support it. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses. Why were long positions hit harder in recent liquidations? Long positions suffered more because the market moved downward rapidly. Traders betting on price increases faced margin calls as values dropped below critical levels. How can I avoid getting liquidated in crypto futures? Use proper risk management including reasonable leverage, stop-loss orders, and adequate margin buffers. Never risk more than you can afford to lose. Do large liquidations indicate market bottom or top? Massive liquidations often signal extreme sentiment and can mark turning points, though timing exact bottoms or tops remains challenging. Which cryptocurrency saw the highest percentage of long liquidations? Solana experienced the highest rate at 83.58% of liquidations coming from long positions, indicating particularly bullish sentiment that turned problematic.

This massive wave of forced position closures highlights the extreme volatility currently gripping digital asset markets and serves as a stark reminder of the risks involved in leveraged trading. What Exactly Are Futures Liquidated? When traders use leverage to open positions larger than their actual capital, exchanges require them to maintain a minimum margin level. If the market moves against their position and their collateral drops below this threshold, the exchange automatically closes their position to prevent further losses. This process is called liquidation, and it just happened on a massive scale. Why Did $115 Million in Futures Get Liquidated? The sudden market movement that triggered these futures liquidated events appears to be driven by several factors: Unexpected regulatory news affecting market sentiment Large whale movements creating selling pressure Cascading liquidations amplifying the initial price drop Overall market uncertainty in current conditions When the first wave of futures liquidated positions hit the market, it created a domino effect. Each forced sale pushed prices lower, triggering more margin calls and additional liquidations in a vicious cycle that wiped out $115 million in just sixty minutes. How Can You Avoid Getting Caught in Futures Liquidated Waves? Protecting yourself from becoming another statistic in these futures liquidated reports requires careful risk management. Consider these essential strategies: Use lower leverage ratios to withstand market volatility Set stop-loss orders at reasonable levels Monitor your margin levels regularly Avoid trading during high-volatility periods Diversify your trading strategies The $878 million in futures liquidated over the past 24 hours demonstrates how quickly conditions can change in cryptocurrency markets. Many traders who felt confident in their positions just hours ago now find their accounts significantly depleted or completely wiped out. What Does This Mean for the Broader Market? When we see massive amounts of futures liquidated in such short timeframes, it often signals a market reset. These events can create buying opportunities for patient investors, but they also indicate heightened uncertainty and potential for continued volatility. The psychological impact of watching $115 million in futures liquidated cannot be underestimated. Such events often lead to reduced trading activity as participants become more cautious, which can result in lower liquidity and even sharper price movements in the future. Key Takeaways From the $115 Million Futures Liquidated Event This dramatic hour of trading teaches several crucial lessons. First, leverage remains a double-edged sword that can amplify both gains and losses. Second, market conditions can change instantly, catching even experienced traders off guard. Finally, proper risk management isn’t optional—it’s essential for survival in cryptocurrency markets. The scale of futures liquidated in this event serves as a powerful warning to all market participants about the dangers of over-leverage and the importance of maintaining healthy margin buffers. Frequently Asked Questions What causes futures to be liquidated? Futures get liquidated when a trader’s position moves against them and their collateral drops below the required maintenance margin level, forcing the exchange to close their position automatically. How can I check if my position is at risk of liquidation? Most exchanges provide real-time margin ratio indicators and liquidation price calculators. Monitor these closely and maintain a safety buffer above the minimum requirements. Are futures liquidations always bad for the market? While painful for affected traders, liquidations can help reset over-leveraged markets and create healthier trading conditions long-term by removing excessive speculation. What’s the difference between partial and full liquidation? Partial liquidation closes only enough of your position to restore margin requirements, while full liquidation closes your entire position when losses exceed available collateral. Can I recover funds after liquidation? Generally, no. Once a position is liquidated, the losses are permanent. Some exchanges offer insurance funds, but these typically cover only specific scenarios. Which cryptocurrencies saw the most liquidations? Bitcoin and Ethereum typically account for the majority of liquidations during market-wide moves, though altcoins can experience even more severe percentage losses.

The deal is made up of investment-grade notes that are to be issued in six parts, and they have maturities ranging from short-term to a 40-year bond, the longest portion, tightened to 0.85 percentage points above Treasuries. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley were reportedly tasked with managing the offering, and Amazon has revealed plans to use the proceeds, which topped initial estimates by $3 billion, for a variety of corporate purposes ranging from acquisitions and capital expenditures to share buybacks and the repayment of its maturing debts. The last time Amazon held a bond sale in the U.S. was in 2022, and at that time, despite the high interest rates, it raised $8.25 billion. The difference in the amounts raised between then and now can be traced to the more favorable environment the recent bond sale has benefited from, as well as heightened investor appetite for debt linked to AI operations. With the amount it was able to raise through this sale, Amazon will be able to accelerate its push into the AI sector without breaking the bank or straining its balance sheet. Big Tech ramps up AI investments Amazon’s bond offering is happening as more big tech firms rush to develop AI infrastructure. These big technology firms have been turning to debt sales worth tens of billions of dollars to fund their various ambitions. Last month, Meta Platforms announced what is being touted as its biggest bond sale of up to $30 billion, while cloud infrastructure and software maker Oracle is also reportedly looking to raise $15 billion in bond sales. Also, earlier this month, Google parent Alphabet Inc. sold $25 billion of debt in the U.S. and Europe, while Meta issued $30 billion of corporate bonds last month, the biggest such offering of the year, and Oracle Corp. raised $18 billion through high-grade notes in September. In total, the major tech firms, including Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet, are expected to spend $400 billion on AI infrastructure this year. Already, Amazon has leveled up its spending on AI, with its capital expenditure expected to cross into the $125 billion region this year and more the year after. It has announced a $38 billion deal with OpenAI, which is expected to give its cloud unit a nice boost as it struggles against Microsoft.

The structure mirrors past market tops, suggesting sellers may not be finished yet. As momentum fades and the 20-week EMA turns lower, traders are watching whether this level can hold, or if a deeper correction is just beginning. Singapore’s SGX to Launch Bitcoin and Ether Perpetual Futures Singapore Exchange (SGX) will launch Bitcoin and Ether perpetual futures on November 24, aiming to meet rising institutional demand for crypto exposure. The products, regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), allow accredited investors to trade BTC and ETH price movements without expiry dates, a structure already popular in global derivatives markets. This marks Singapore’s second perpetual futures rollout in 2025, following EDXM’s July launch, reinforcing the nation’s role as a regional digital asset hub. SGX said the initiative strengthens the bridge between crypto and traditional finance, while maintaining strict oversight to ensure compliance and investor protection.

Crypto ETPs Record $2 Billion in Outflows, Largest Drop Since February Cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) saw $2 billion in outflows last week, marking the largest weekly withdrawal since February, according to CoinShares. Outflows surged 71% from the previous week’s $1.17 billion, bringing total redemptions over the past three weeks to $3.2 billion. CoinShares’ head of research James Butterfill attributed the decline to selling by large crypto-native investors and monetary policy uncertainty, which has dampened risk appetite. As a result, total assets under management in crypto ETPs dropped from an October peak of $264 billion to $191 billion, a 27% decline. UPDATE: Digital asset ETPs recorded $2B in outflows last week, the largest since February. pic.twitter.com/H0EyJhPFGF — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) November 17, 2025 Regionally, the U.S. accounted for 97% of all outflows, while Germany stood out with $13.2 million in inflows, signaling selective European resilience. By asset, Bitcoin ETPs saw $1.4 billion in outflows, and Ether ETPs lost $700 million, while Solana and XRP products posted smaller declines. Despite the retreat, inflows into short-Bitcoin and diversified products indicate investors are rotating exposure rather than exiting the market entirely. Historically, such large-scale outflows have applied short-term pressure on Bitcoin’s price but tend to ease once policy clarity and market sentiment stabilize, paving the way for a potential long-term recovery. BTC Inc. Names Brandon Green as CEO Amid 140% Revenue Surge BTC Inc., the parent company of Bitcoin Magazine and the Bitcoin Conference, has appointed Brandon Green as its new CEO. Green, who joined the firm in 2017, has played a key role in expanding Bitcoin events to Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong, and Amsterdam. Former CEO David Bailey will remain as Chairman of the Board. The company reported strong financial performance for the first nine months of 2025, with revenue up 140% year-over-year to $61.9 million and EBITDA reaching $23 million. Global conference attendance also climbed 45%, while Bitcoin Magazine drew over 175 million monthly impressions, reflecting expanding global engagement. Looking ahead to 2026, BTC Inc. plans to accelerate international expansion and introduce new institutional-focused offerings. The company’s growth reinforces confidence in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem, as strong corporate performance and rising global participation often signal deeper market maturity and long-term optimism for BTC. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Bearish ABCD Pattern Targets $83,800 Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish as BTC/USD slid to around $90,000. Right now, BTC is completing a bearish ABCD pattern, extending its decline toward the $83,800 demand zone after losing key support at $99,000. The ABCD structure, where the AB and CD legs mirror in length and slope, signals that BTC may be nearing the final stage of its correction. On the weekly chart, the CD leg aligns with the 127.2% Fibonacci extension from the AB swing, while RSI near 37 shows oversold conditions without yet confirming divergence. The 20-week EMA has turned lower for the first time this year, underscoring fading momentum, though the widening gap from price hints at a possible rebound. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If buyers defend the $83,800 level, BTC could bounce toward $96,000–$99,000, where the broken trendline now acts as resistance. A bullish engulfing candle near support could mark the start of recovery, while a drop below $83,000 would risk deeper losses toward $74,500. This ABCD setup suggests Bitcoin may be approaching its final corrective leg before a potential relief rally. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana?

The current Bitcoin price movement reflects typical market correction patterns after extended growth periods. What Does This Bitcoin Price Movement Mean for Investors? For long-term holders, this Bitcoin price correction might represent a buying opportunity. However, short-term traders face increased volatility. Consider these key points: Support levels to watch include $88,000 and $85,000 Trading volume has increased significantly during the decline Market sentiment has shifted from bullish to cautious Historical patterns suggest potential recovery within weeks The current Bitcoin price action demonstrates why risk management remains crucial in cryptocurrency investing.

Speaking from the White House, he told reporters the checks would go to middle- and moderate-income individuals, just months before critical midterm elections. According to Axios , this is the first time Trump has attached an actual timeframe to the plan, which until now had been more slogan than policy. He said the money would come from tariff revenues, calling it a “dividend” for citizens who’ve carried the weight of global trade. But for the payments to happen, Congress has to pass new legislation, and it’s not at all clear if that’s even on lawmakers’ radar. Bessent confirms the plan needs legislation, offers no clarity on delivery Scott Bessent, who runs the Treasury, said over the weekend that the administration can’t distribute any stimulus without Congress acting first. He made that clear during an interview on Fox News, saying, “We need legislation.” When asked if the checks were guaranteed, Scott shrugged it off: “We will see.” He also hinted that the money might not come as paper checks at all; maybe tax rebates, maybe something else. It’s still being worked out. Trump, for his part, kept things vague. “We’re going to be issuing dividends later on, somewhere prior to, you know, probably the middle of next year, a little bit later than that,” he said. He estimated the amount would be “thousands of dollars” but didn’t give more details. There was no word on how the eligibility would be determined, how the funds would be transferred, or how they’d prevent fraud, just that it’s coming. But pulling it off won’t be cheap.If the payout goes to individuals instead of households, and only targets middle- and low-income Americans, the total cost could top $200 billion. That’s more than what tariffs brought in during 2025, and about half of what’s projected for 2026. The numbers are huge, and the math doesn’t exactly balance out. Legal fight over tariffs adds more pressure to the plan’s future A separate fight could wreck the whole idea before it starts. The Supreme Court is set to rule in the coming months on whether many of Trump’s tariffs are even legal. If he loses, he says it could cost the country $3 trillion in refunds and lost business, a number critics say is exaggerated but still serious enough to scare lawmakers off any new spending tied to tariffs. Even with that legal cloud hanging, Trump continues to pitch tariffs as the centerpiece of his economic agenda. He claims they protect American jobs, force trade partners to play fair, and bring in revenue without raising taxes. And now, he says, they’ll bankroll direct payments to Americans. It’s part of a broader “affordability” push by Republicans trying to win back momentum after Democrats swept major elections earlier this month. Trump also said Friday that he’s open to cutting tariffs on things like beef, coffee, tropical fruits, and other commodities. That’s despite insisting tariffs don’t raise consumer prices. On Truth Social, he posted, “Affordability is a lie when used by the Dems. It is a complete CON JOB.” Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Compounding this uncertainty, a fresh sell signal has emerged from one of the cryptocurrency’s key indicators, reminiscent of the past when similar signals led to a staggering 67% drop in value. Bitcoin Price Could Plunge To $31,000 Market expert Ali Martinez pointed out in a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that the last time the SuperTrend indicator issued a sell signal for Bitcoin was in 2022. At that time, Bitcoin, which had reached an all-time high of $69,000, subsequently fell to around $17,000. Related Reading: Can Strategy Survive A 90% Bitcoin Crash? Saylor Says Yes While the market landscape has changed significantly since then—with the introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), new digital asset treasuries (DATs), and increased institutional support spurred by pro-crypto regulations—the current situation mirrors some of those past concerns. As it stands, the Bitcoin price is trading just above $94,500. If the historical trend of a 67% retracement were to repeat in the next months, the price could potentially fall to around $31,185, which could be the potential bottom of the new bear market. Adding to the conversation, another analyst known as Mr. Wall Street suggested that the recent Bitcoin price peak might be at $126,000. He forecasted that the next major downward move could see BTC hit levels between $74,000 and $82,000, ultimately reaching a target between $54,000 and $60,000 by the fourth quarter of 2026. This perspective contributes to the notion that Bitcoin is likely confirmed in a bear market, which could result in a year-long decline marked by price fluctuations similar to those seen in previous bear cycles. A New Death Cross Emerges Further complicating the outlook, analyst Doctor Profit pointed out a significant technical signal: the Bitcoin price experienced a death cross for the first time since April 2025. This event, marked by the 50-day moving average (MA) crossing below the 200-day moving average, historically led to rallies of 25% to 60% in the following three months. However, Doctor Profit emphasized a crucial difference this time around: the death cross occurred while Bitcoin was trading 6% below the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA50). In the previous instances, such crosses happened while Bitcoin was positioned above the EMA50, suggesting a different market sentiment this time. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Ethereum Price Is Crashing Again, Can It Breach $3,000? The current bearish sentiment is intensified by negative trends in ETF sales and whale net volume, adding significant pressure to the Bitcoin price. With the average entry price for Bitcoin buyers over the past six months set at approximately $94,600, falling back toward or below this level could trigger fresh selling pressure. Historically, short-term traders tend to exit at breakeven or even at a slight loss, raising concerns about further declines. Doctor Profit concluded his analysis stating: This combination of ETF selling, whale selling, and a large cluster of sellers sitting at breakeven levels is a dangerous setup and adds to the bearish case.

Aave Labs Introduces Savings-Style App According to a report from Fortune, this new product is designed to function similarly to a traditional savings account, but with higher yields than those offered by traditional finance banks. Users can earn a minimum interest rate of 5% on their deposits, which can be funded through bank accounts or debit cards. The app will utilize stablecoins alongside the Aave protocol to offer these financial services. Aave has established itself as a key player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto lending sectors, boasting over $3.23 trillion in cumulative deposits, nearly $1 trillion in total originated loan volume and $ billion in total interest paid, according to the platform’s website . While DeFi protocols often provide users with higher interest rates compared to conventional banking, they also carry heightened risks, such as the potential for hacks and the absence of government backing. However, Stani Kulechov, the founder and CEO of Aave Labs, assured users of the protocol’s safety. He pointed out that Aave has never encountered an exploit in its five-year history, emphasizing the dual layers of security related to both the market economics and the software code, which has been audited by multiple companies. Traditional Financial Giants Adopting Crypto The forthcoming launch of the Aave app arrives at a time when the gap between traditional financial institutions and crypto-native firms is closing. Major players like BlackRock are adopting Bitcoin (BTC) through the exchange-traded fund (ETF) sector. Stripe has integrated stablecoins into its offerings, and JPMorgan Chase has been actively developing blockchain solutions. In response, crypto firms are increasingly focusing on attracting mainstream customers. The US crypto exchange Kraken, for example, has newly introduced its own payments app, while various others are working to create bank-like products using stablecoins. Kulechov remarked, “Typically, DeFi has been accessible to very savvy, professional users. The next step for DeFi is to bring more direct access for consumers.” Kulechov, a figure in the DeFi movement since launching the protocol in 2020, has expanded the company’s offerings to include a crypto wallet, a decentralized stablecoin, and a protocol for social media. In October, the firm made headlines by acquiring the stablecoin company Stable Finance for an undisclosed amount.

It was also the third consecutive week of negative flows, which pushed the combined total to $3.2 billion. CoinShares attributed the downturn to ongoing monetary policy uncertainty in addition to selling activity from major crypto whales. Falling prices have further weighed on the sector, causing the total assets under management in digital-asset ETPs to slide by almost 27% from their early-October peak of $264 billion to $191 billion. Digital Asset Exodus In the latest edition of the Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, CoinShares reported that Bitcoin was hit hardest by last week’s negative sentiment and recorded $1.38 billion in outflows, while extending its three-week streak and now accounting for 2% of total assets under management (AuM). At the same time, short Bitcoin products attracted $9.1 million in inflows over the past week, which indicates that some traders are positioning for further downside. Zooming out, these ETPs have seen $18.1 million in new inflows over the past three weeks. Ethereum performed even worse and witnessed $689 million in outflows, equal to 4% of its AuM. Solana and XRP also posted small outflows of $8.3 million and $15.5 million, respectively. On the other hand, Sui, Litecoin, and Cardano saw modest inflows of $6 million, $3.3 million, and $0.4 million. Multi-asset investment products also drew $31.2 million in new capital. In fact, cautious market conditions pushed investors toward these diversified products, which resulted in $69 million flowing into multi-asset ETPs over the past three weeks. Negative sentiment hit most regions, and was led overwhelmingly by the US, which recorded $1.97 billion in outflows, or 97% of the global total. Several other markets also saw similar outflows, including Switzerland with $39.9 million, Sweden with $1.3 million, and Hong Kong with $12.3 million. Canada and Australia followed suit with $9.8 million and $1.8 million in outflows. On the other hand, Germany stood out as the only major region to take advantage of the price pullback, while attracting $13.2 million in inflows. Brazil also bucked the trend and registered a more modest $2.4 million in new capital. Sentiment Cautious But Constructive Despite the current struggles , certain market experts believe that Bitcoin is in the later stages of its correction rather than entering a new downtrend. In a statement to CryptoPotato , Zilliqa’s Interim CEO Alexander Zahnd explained that the market twice rejected levels just below $100,000, which means that forced selling has mostly cleared, and buyers are quietly defending a key support zone. While it is too early to confirm a bottom, he said the market is stabilising. The exec added that recent bearish sentiment is being driven by ETF outflows, thinner liquidity, and a temporary pause in institutional allocation, none of which indicate a structural shift. Instead, investors are waiting for clearer macro signals after the Fed’s recent pause and US shutdown concerns. He described the overall sentiment as “cautious but constructive.” Zahnd went on to add, “Positioning has lightened, but we’re not seeing panic. The rotation into ecosystems like Solana shows that capital is still active, just more selective. This phase is about rebuilding pressure, not chasing momentum. If anything, the current environment favours gradual accumulation on support rather than trying to time dramatic moves. The next impulse will likely come once ETF flows stabilise or new institutional buyers step back in.” The post Bitcoin Bleeds $1.38B as Traders Rush Into Bearish Bets, Ethereum Hit Even Harder appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Ethereum|Solana|XRP,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-11-18 04:03:13

His recent statement on social media platform X has sent shockwaves through the crypto community, suggesting we’re approaching a pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Why This Might Be Your Last Chance to Buy Bitcoin Under $90K Cameron Winklevoss, one of the most influential figures in cryptocurrency, made a bold declaration that could change investment strategies worldwide. He believes current price levels represent the final opportunity to purchase Bitcoin under $90K. This prediction comes from extensive market analysis and institutional adoption trends. The timing coincides with several key market developments: Increasing institutional investment Growing mainstream acceptance Upcoming Bitcoin halving event Global economic uncertainty driving digital asset demand What Makes the $90K Bitcoin Price Target Significant? Reaching $90K would represent a major psychological and technical breakthrough for Bitcoin. This price level has been identified by multiple analysts as a critical resistance point. Once breached, many experts predict accelerated growth toward six-figure valuations. Historical patterns show that Bitcoin often experiences rapid price appreciation after breaking through key resistance levels. The current market structure suggests we might be approaching such a breakout moment. Therefore, the opportunity to buy Bitcoin under $90K might indeed be limited. How Should Investors Approach This Bitcoin Prediction? While Winklevoss’s statement carries significant weight, experienced investors know that cryptocurrency markets remain volatile. However, several factors support his optimistic outlook about buying Bitcoin under $90K being a time-sensitive opportunity. Consider these market indicators: Growing institutional adoption Limited supply mechanics Increasing global recognition as digital gold Technical analysis showing strong upward momentum Understanding the Risks and Opportunities Every investment carries potential risks alongside opportunities. The chance to acquire Bitcoin under $90K comes with both. Market volatility means prices can fluctuate significantly, even with positive long-term trends. However, the fundamental case for Bitcoin remains strong. Its limited supply, growing adoption, and proven resilience over more than a decade create a compelling investment thesis. The window to buy Bitcoin under $90K might close sooner than many expect. Final Thoughts on the $90K Bitcoin Threshold The cryptocurrency market stands at what could be a historic inflection point. Winklevoss’s warning about the final opportunity to buy Bitcoin under $90K deserves serious consideration from both new and experienced investors. While no prediction is guaranteed, the combination of technical, fundamental, and market sentiment factors suggests we’re approaching a significant price movement. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly did Cameron Winklevoss say about Bitcoin? He stated on platform X that this is likely the last chance to purchase Bitcoin for under $90,000, based on current market analysis and adoption trends. How reliable are price predictions from crypto founders? While industry leaders have valuable insights, all cryptocurrency predictions should be considered alongside independent research and risk assessment. What factors could drive Bitcoin above $90K? Key drivers include institutional adoption, ETF approvals, macroeconomic conditions, and the upcoming Bitcoin halving reducing new supply. Should beginners invest based on this prediction? New investors should research thoroughly, understand volatility risks, and only invest what they can afford to lose, regardless of predictions. What’s the time frame for this $90K prediction? Winklevoss didn’t specify an exact timeline, suggesting the current price window might close relatively soon based on market momentum. Are there alternatives if I miss buying Bitcoin under $90K? Yes, dollar-cost averaging and researching other cryptocurrency opportunities remain viable strategies for long-term portfolio growth. Found this analysis helpful?

The recent market movements have pushed Bitcoin’s technical indicators into concerning levels, raising important questions about what comes next for BTC price action. Understanding what Bitcoin oversold conditions mean could help traders navigate these volatile waters. What Does Bitcoin Oversold Actually Mean? When analysts say Bitcoin is oversold, they’re referring to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) dropping below 30. This technical indicator measures the speed and change of price movements. The current 14-day RSI reading suggests that selling pressure has pushed Bitcoin to potentially unsustainable levels. However, being oversold doesn’t guarantee an immediate rebound – it simply indicates that the asset may be due for some form of correction or consolidation. How Serious Is This Bitcoin Oversold Condition? The current Bitcoin oversold situation carries significant weight for several reasons: Historical patterns show similar RSI drops preceded major price bottoms The February precedent saw BTC eventually form a bottom at $75,000 Market sentiment has turned noticeably bearish Trading volume patterns suggest institutional caution This combination of factors creates a complex scenario where short-term pain could potentially lead to long-term gain for patient investors. Will Bitcoin Rebound or Continue Declining? Market analysts are divided on the immediate outlook for Bitcoin. The Bitcoin oversold condition typically suggests one of two outcomes. First, we might see a sideways movement period where the market consolidates and builds a new foundation. Alternatively, a sharp rebound could occur if positive catalysts emerge. However, most experts caution that downward pressure may persist before any significant recovery begins. What Historical Patterns Tell Us About Bitcoin Oversold Phases Looking back at previous Bitcoin oversold periods reveals valuable insights. The late February instance where RSI dropped below 30 resulted in Bitcoin finding support two months later. This pattern suggests that while oversold conditions can signal buying opportunities, they don’t necessarily indicate immediate reversals. The market often needs time to absorb selling pressure and rebuild confidence among investors. Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Traders Navigating this Bitcoin oversold environment requires careful strategy. Consider these approaches: Dollar-cost averaging into positions during weakness Setting clear stop-loss levels to manage risk Monitoring key support levels for potential entry points Watching for fundamental catalysts that could change sentiment Remember that oversold conditions can persist longer than expected, so patience remains crucial. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin Oversold Waters The current Bitcoin oversold situation presents both challenges and opportunities for cryptocurrency investors. While technical indicators suggest potential for recovery, the market’s immediate direction remains uncertain. Successful navigation of this period will depend on risk management, patience, and careful attention to both technical and fundamental factors. The coming weeks will reveal whether history repeats itself or if new patterns emerge in Bitcoin’s ongoing evolution. Frequently Asked Questions What does oversold mean for Bitcoin? Oversold means Bitcoin’s price has fallen too far too fast, as measured by technical indicators like RSI dropping below 30. It suggests potential for a bounce but doesn’t guarantee immediate recovery. How long do Bitcoin oversold conditions typically last? Oversold conditions can last from several days to multiple weeks. The late February instance saw Bitcoin take about two months to form a solid bottom after RSI dropped below 30. Should I buy Bitcoin when it’s oversold? While oversold conditions can present buying opportunities, they should be approached with caution. Consider dollar-cost averaging and ensure you have proper risk management in place. What other indicators should I watch with RSI? Combine RSI readings with volume analysis, moving averages, and support/resistance levels for a more complete market picture. Can Bitcoin stay oversold for extended periods? Yes, assets can remain oversold longer than expected during strong bearish trends. Oversold doesn’t necessarily mean immediate reversal is guaranteed. What’s the difference between oversold and undervalued? Oversold refers to technical price movements, while undervalued relates to fundamental assessment of intrinsic worth. An asset can be technically oversold but not fundamentally undervalued. Found this analysis helpful?

Gox BTC Transfer: Stunning $937 Million Move Shakes Crypto Markets,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/mt-gox-btc-transfer-update/,"BitcoinWorld Mt. Gox BTC Transfer: Stunning $937 Million Move Shakes Crypto Markets In a stunning development that has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community, the defunct Mt. Gox exchange has executed a massive Mt. Gox BTC transfer worth nearly $1 billion. This monumental movement of 10,422 Bitcoin marks the first significant wallet activity from the exchange in eight long months, raising crucial questions about market impact and creditor repayment timelines. What Does This Massive Mt. Gox BTC Transfer Mean? The recent Mt. Gox BTC transfer represents one of the largest cryptocurrency movements in recent history. According to blockchain analytics firm Onchain Lens, the exchange moved exactly 10,422 BTC to a new wallet address. Market experts immediately identified this as likely cold storage relocation, suggesting the exchange is securing assets ahead of future creditor distributions. This strategic move comes at a critical juncture. The transfer follows Mt. Gox’s official announcement extending their creditor repayment deadline by one full year to October 31, 2025. The timing suggests careful planning rather than rushed decision-making. Why Should Bitcoin Investors Care About This Development? The Mt. Gox BTC transfer carries significant implications for every Bitcoin holder. When such substantial amounts move after years of dormancy, market participants understandably grow concerned about potential selling pressure. However, several factors suggest this transfer might not immediately impact prices: Cold Storage Indication: The move to presumed cold storage suggests long-term holding rather than imminent selling Extended Timeline: With repayments pushed to 2025, immediate market pressure appears unlikely Market Maturity: Today’s Bitcoin market can absorb larger transactions than during previous Mt. Gox eras How Does This Affect Creditor Repayment Expectations? The postponed repayment deadline to October 2025 provides crucial breathing room for both the exchange and creditors. This Mt. Gox BTC transfer demonstrates active management of the remaining assets, which should reassure those awaiting compensation. The careful wallet management suggests the rehabilitation trustees are proceeding methodically rather than hastily. Creditors should note that this transfer represents positive movement in the long-stalled process. The activity indicates the exchange’s commitment to eventually distributing assets, even if the timeline has extended further than originally anticipated. What Lessons Can We Learn From This Situation? The ongoing Mt. Gox BTC transfer saga teaches valuable lessons about cryptocurrency security and exchange reliability. The original Mt. Gox collapse in 2014 resulted from security failures and mismanagement, highlighting the importance of: Personal custody solutions for significant cryptocurrency holdings Thorough due diligence when selecting exchange platforms Understanding the risks of centralized custody versus self-custody Will This Impact Bitcoin’s Price Trajectory? While any major Mt. Gox BTC transfer naturally creates market uncertainty, several factors mitigate immediate price concerns. The extended repayment timeline allows markets to gradually absorb information rather than react to sudden liquidations. Furthermore, the growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin provides additional market stability that didn’t exist during previous Mt. Gox-related selloffs. Market analysts suggest monitoring blockchain activity for additional transfers, as multiple movements could signal different intentions than a single consolidation transaction. Conclusion: Navigating the Mt. Gox Legacy The recent Mt. Gox BTC transfer serves as a powerful reminder of cryptocurrency’s evolving maturity. While the movement of nearly $1 billion in Bitcoin naturally captures attention, the underlying story reveals progress in resolving one of crypto’s most challenging historical episodes. The methodical approach to asset management and extended timeline demonstrates responsible stewardship, offering hope for eventual creditor resolution while minimizing market disruption. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly happened with the Mt. Gox BTC transfer? Mt. Gox moved 10,422 Bitcoin worth approximately $937 million to a new wallet address, marking their first major transfer in eight months. Blockchain analysts believe this represents movement to cold storage for secure holding. Will this transfer cause Bitcoin’s price to drop? Most analysts don’t expect immediate price impact since the transfer appears to be for secure storage rather than preparation for selling. The extended repayment deadline to 2025 further reduces near-term selling pressure concerns. When will Mt. Gox creditors receive their repayments? The official repayment deadline has been extended to October 31, 2025. This transfer suggests the rehabilitation trustees are actively managing assets in preparation for future distributions. How much Bitcoin does Mt. Gox still control? While exact figures vary, estimates suggest Mt. Gox controls approximately 140,000 Bitcoin remaining from the original hack and collapse. This transfer involved only a portion of those holdings. Should I be worried about my Bitcoin investments? Most market participants view this transfer as neutral to positive, demonstrating responsible asset management rather than imminent selling pressure. The cryptocurrency market has matured significantly since the original Mt. Gox collapse. What’s the significance of moving to cold storage? Cold storage refers to keeping cryptocurrency offline for enhanced security. This move suggests Mt. Gox is prioritizing asset protection, which benefits both the exchange and awaiting creditors.

The Japanese yen has plunged to its lowest level in nine months, sparking concerns about fiscal stability and regional economic impacts that could ripple through global markets. Why are Asian currencies declining? The Federal Reserve uncertainty continues to dominate global currency markets, creating a challenging environment for Asian currencies. Market participants remain divided on the Fed’s next moves, with conflicting economic data creating confusion about the timing of potential rate cuts. This uncertainty has strengthened the US dollar, putting downward pressure on emerging market currencies throughout Asia. Japanese yen hits critical support level The Japanese yen’s dramatic slide to nine-month lows reflects growing fiscal concerns about Japan’s economic policies. The currency has broken through several key technical levels, raising alarms among traders and policymakers alike. This decline comes amid questions about the Bank of Japan’s ability to manage inflation while supporting economic growth. Federal Reserve policy impacts global forex market The Federal Reserve uncertainty extends beyond US borders, significantly affecting the global forex market. Asian central banks now face difficult decisions about whether to follow Fed policy or pursue independent monetary strategies. The current situation highlights several key challenges: Diverging monetary policies between major economies Capital flow volatility affecting currency stability Inflation management across different economic cycles Trade balance impacts from currency fluctuations Fiscal concerns driving yen weakness Market participants point to several fiscal concerns contributing to the yen’s weakness. Japan’s substantial public debt, combined with ongoing stimulus measures, has created uncertainty about long-term fiscal sustainability. These factors have undermined confidence in the currency, despite the Bank of Japan’s efforts to maintain stability. What does this mean for currency traders? The current volatility in Asian currencies presents both risks and opportunities for forex market participants. Traders should consider several key factors when navigating this environment: Currency Current Trend Key Factors Support Levels Japanese Yen Bearish Fiscal policy, BoJ stance 145.00, 148.00 Chinese Yuan Moderate pressure Trade relations, PBOC intervention 7.25, 7.30 Indian Rupee Stable with pressure Oil prices, RBI actions 83.50, 84.00 Actionable insights for market participants Navigating the current Federal Reserve uncertainty requires careful strategy and risk management. Consider these approaches: Monitor Fed communications for policy direction clues Watch for intervention signals from Asian central banks Diversify currency exposure to manage volatility risk Set clear stop-loss levels given current market conditions The road ahead for Asian currencies The outlook for Asian currencies remains heavily dependent on Federal Reserve policy clarity and regional economic developments. While current conditions present challenges, they also create potential opportunities for strategic positioning in the forex market. The key will be monitoring how fiscal concerns evolve and how central banks respond to changing global conditions. The dramatic moves in Asian currencies serve as a powerful reminder of how interconnected global financial markets have become. The Japanese yen’s decline to nine-month lows underscores the vulnerability of even major currencies to shifting policy expectations and fiscal uncertainties. As markets continue to digest Federal Reserve signals and assess regional economic health, volatility in the forex market appears likely to persist, creating both risks and opportunities for informed participants. Frequently Asked Questions What is causing the Japanese yen’s decline? The Japanese yen’s weakness stems from multiple factors including fiscal concerns about Japan’s economic policies, the Bank of Japan’s monetary stance, and broader Federal Reserve uncertainty affecting global currency markets. How does Federal Reserve policy affect Asian currencies? Federal Reserve decisions influence global capital flows and dollar strength, which directly impacts Asian currencies. When the Fed signals potential rate changes, it creates volatility across emerging market currencies as investors adjust their portfolios. Which Asian currencies are most affected by current conditions? While the Japanese yen has shown the most dramatic moves, other Asian currencies including the Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, and Southeast Asian currencies are also experiencing pressure from Federal Reserve uncertainty and global market conditions. What should traders watch in the coming weeks? Traders should monitor Federal Reserve communications, economic data from major economies, central bank interventions, and technical support levels in key currency pairs to navigate current market conditions effectively. Are there opportunities in this volatile environment? Yes, volatility often creates trading opportunities for well-prepared market participants. However, proper risk management and careful analysis of fundamental and technical factors remain essential for success in current market conditions.

54555973,https://timestabloid.com/?p=89919,1763443302,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,New Market Signals Indicate Shiba Inu (SHIB) Is Not Going to Zero,https://timestabloid.com/new-market-signals-indicate-shiba-inu-shib-is-not-going-to-zero/,"Concerns about Shiba Inu (SHIB) long-term viability resurfaced during the latest market pullback, with some commentators insisting that the asset is on a path toward complete collapse. However, several key indicators, including trading activity, large-holder behaviour, and regulatory developments, offer a more grounded picture. The available data shows that SHIB remains actively traded and continues to attract interest from major investors, undermining the notion that it is approaching zero. Price Weakness Fuels Renewed Doubts SHIB has struggled to maintain momentum after losing the $0.00001 benchmark, a level that previously served as short-term support. The token briefly rebounded to approximately $0.00001022 last week but quickly fell back, touching $0.0000086 before edging up to around $0.00000898. These movements revived recurring claims that the asset is on the verge of becoming worthless, claims that tend to surface whenever Shiba Inu experiences a sharp decline. Despite these fluctuations, SHIB maintains a multi-billion-dollar market capitalization. Assets of this size with consistent liquidity do not simply disappear, even during extended downturns. The continued participation of major exchanges supports this point. Trading Activity Remains Substantial Current volume levels contradict the idea that Shiba Inu is losing relevance. CoinMarketCap data shows that SHIB’s 24-hour trading volume increased by more than 5%, reaching approximately $145 million. Significant volumes were recorded across leading exchanges such as Binance, KuCoin, OKX, Upbit, and Coinbase. In addition, SHIB has spent several weeks trading within a narrow range between $0.000009 and $0.000010. This type of consolidation often signals the market is preparing for a decisive move, although the direction of that move remains uncertain. Behaviour from major holders offers another important signal. If investors with substantial positions believed SHIB was nearing failure, exchange inflows would rise as they moved funds to sell. Current on-chain data shows the opposite. CryptoQuant reports that the amount of SHIB held on exchanges has continued to decline, dropping from roughly 82.03 trillion tokens at the beginning of the month to about 81.77 trillion tokens. This decrease suggests that holders are either withdrawing their tokens for long-term storage or simply maintaining their positions rather than preparing for mass liquidation. Analysts Expect a Potential Upside Several analysts maintain a positive outlook on SHIB’s medium-term performance. TradingView analyst Kledji Cuni projects that the token could experience a significant rally, estimating gains of 100% to over 500%. His model points to the possibility of SHIB reaching levels near $0.0000420 if market conditions align. Additional market observers, including Eunice Wong and Himanshu Maradiya of the CIFDAQ Blockchain Ecosystem, anticipate that SHIB may trade at higher valuations in the coming months, suggesting the token’s outlook is more complex than its critics imply. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ecosystem and Regulatory Developments Strengthen SHIB’s Standing Positive updates from the Shiba Inu team have also helped counter negative sentiment. The project recently teased an upcoming integration with Bitget Wallet, which has prompted speculation about new use-case expansions. Shiba Inu (SHIB) also secured a place on Japan’s “green list,” a regulatory category reserved for digital assets that meet the country’s approval standards, placing it alongside major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Growing discussions around a potential SHIB-based ETF have further fueled interest. Although no issuer has submitted a formal application, Grayscale’s recent confirmation that SHIB fits within the SEC’s Generic Listing Standard has encouraged speculation that an ETF could eventually emerge. While Shiba Inu is not showing strong upward momentum, the available evidence does not support the claim that the token is approaching zero. Its main challenge is limited near-term catalysts, which could lead to continued sideways movement. However, active trading, declining exchange reserves, and sustained community and institutional interest suggest that SHIB’s position in the market remains stable rather than deteriorating.

At the same time, the Digital Chamber is ramping up state-level advocacy through its new State Network, which is a nationwide initiative backed by Strategy, Hedera and Input Output. The goal of the initiative is to educate lawmakers, shape local legislation and build long-term political support for digital asset innovation. Crypto Tax Rules Tighten The White House is reviewing a major Internal Revenue Service proposal that would pull the United States into the global Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF). This will be one of the biggest steps yet toward tighter international oversight of digital asset activity. The proposal was submitted last Friday and titled “Broker Digital Transaction Reporting,” and would formally align the US with 72 countries that have already committed to implementing CARF by 2028. Although the IRS did not classify the rule as “economically significant,” its impact on American crypto users would be major, as it will force far stricter reporting requirements for anyone holding or trading digital assets on foreign platforms. Broker Digital Transaction Reporting proposal CARF was created by the OECD in late 2022, and it is designed to help governments share cryptocurrency account data across borders to combat tax evasion. The framework is scheduled to launch in 2027 with 50 countries — including major economies like the UK, Italy, Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia and Spain — already preparing to participate. Another 23 countries, the United States among them, signaled commitments to adopt CARF rules by 2028. Combined, the initiative covers more than one-third of the world, which is a scale intended to make it much more difficult for crypto users to hide offshore activity by moving assets across jurisdictions. (Source: Pixelplex ) In a policy recommendations report that was released in late July, the White House argued that adopting CARF will help prevent American taxpayers from shifting digital assets to foreign exchanges in an attempt to bypass reporting obligations. Officials also said the move would ensure US-based crypto platforms do not face competitive disadvantages by operating under stricter domestic oversight than offshore rivals. In the US, even tougher transparency rules are on the way. Beginning in January of 2026, US exchanges will be required to issue 1099-DA forms, a new reporting structure that captures detailed inflow and outflow data for crypto transactions — including transfers between wallets. Crypto tax attorney Clinton Donnelly said the 1099-DA rollout suggests the “beginning of the end of crypto anonymity” in the United States. He explained that the IRS currently lacks instant visibility into activity on public blockchains, but warned that with enhanced reporting, better analytical tools and improved data integration, the agency will soon have the ability to scan networks at scale, identify non-compliant taxpayers and target them for audits. State Network Expands Crypto Advocacy The Digital Chamber also recently unveiled a nationwide initiative that is designed to influence state-level digital asset policy ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The new effort is known as the State Network, and its goal is to connect policymakers, regulators and industry leaders in a shared ecosystem focused on advancing blockchain adoption and equipping lawmakers with the expertise needed to craft effective legislation. Several major industry players signed on as inaugural members , including Michael Saylor’s firm Strategy, the Hedera public network and Input Output, the blockchain research company behind Cardano’s infrastructure work. Their participation already suggests that there is strong industry backing for a movement that is shifting more of the crypto policy fight from Washington to state capitals. Education is central to the initiative. Through a partnership with the nonprofit Future Caucus, the State Network plans to train lawmakers in targeted states and develop a pipeline of future political leaders who understand digital assets. Cody Carbone, CEO of The Digital Chamber, said the collaboration will help build “a bench of strong leaders” capable of shaping policies that keep states competitive in the digital economy. Crypto already played a big role in the 2024 federal election cycle, where companies poured more than $134 million into campaigns and media efforts. Beyond policy engagement, the State Network is also launching a Microgrants Program, which is set to begin in 2026 and will strengthen state blockchain associations, university blockchain clubs and community innovation groups. The grants will support policy toolkits, regulatory sandboxes and grassroots educational initiatives. Anastasia Dellaccio , the network’s executive director, described the program as a foundational effort to empower local advocacy groups that can mobilize around digital asset issues. Although the initiative officially launched on Monday, the State Network has already been active in New York, Arizona, Ohio and New Hampshire, where it began educating lawmakers on blockchain and digital asset use cases. A national advocacy tour, the 2026 Digital Asset Tour, is also planned to bring the group’s efforts directly to state legislatures across the country.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-18 05:30:00

U.S. funds just recorded a staggering $250 million net outflow on November 17, marking the fourth consecutive day of withdrawals. This trend raises crucial questions about investor sentiment and market stability. What Caused the Bitcoin Spot ETFs Outflow? Data from SoSoValue reveals BlackRock’s IBIT led the exodus with $145 million in outflows. Other major players followed suit, creating a domino effect across the cryptocurrency investment landscape. The consistent withdrawals suggest shifting investor strategies. Several factors might explain this movement. Market volatility often triggers such responses. Moreover, investors might be reallocating assets ahead of potential regulatory changes. Therefore, understanding these patterns becomes essential for informed decision-making. Which Bitcoin Spot ETFs Were Most Affected? The outflow distribution shows clear patterns among different funds: BlackRock’s IBIT: $145 million Grayscale’s GBTC: $34.52 million Ark Invest’s ARKB: $29.67 million VanEck’s HODL: $23.32 million Notably, no Bitcoin spot ETFs reported net inflows for the day. This uniform trend indicates broader market concerns rather than isolated fund performance issues. How Do Bitcoin Spot ETFs Impact Crypto Markets? Bitcoin spot ETFs serve as crucial bridges between traditional finance and cryptocurrency. When these funds experience significant outflows, the effects ripple through entire crypto ecosystems. Consequently, monitoring these instruments provides valuable market insights. Large-scale movements in Bitcoin spot ETFs often precede price adjustments. They reflect institutional sentiment and can influence retail investor behavior. Understanding these dynamics helps traders anticipate market directions. What Does This Mean for Future Bitcoin Spot ETFs? The four-day outflow streak suggests temporary caution rather than long-term abandonment. Historically, Bitcoin spot ETFs have shown resilience after such periods. However, sustained outflows could signal deeper market adjustments. Investors should watch for reversal patterns and regulatory developments. The performance of Bitcoin spot ETFs often indicates broader cryptocurrency acceptance levels. Therefore, this situation warrants careful observation. Key Takeaways From the Bitcoin Spot ETFs Situation This episode highlights several important aspects: Market Sensitivity : Bitcoin spot ETFs react quickly to investor sentiment changes Institutional Influence : Major players like BlackRock significantly impact flows Trend Importance : Consecutive outflows merit attention beyond single-day movements The Bitcoin spot ETFs landscape continues evolving. While current outflows concern investors, they also create potential entry points for new positions. The market’s ability to absorb these movements will test cryptocurrency maturity. FAQs About Bitcoin Spot ETFs What are Bitcoin spot ETFs? Bitcoin spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure without owning the cryptocurrency directly. Why are outflows important? Outflows indicate reduced investor confidence and can signal broader market trends, potentially affecting Bitcoin prices. How long do outflow trends typically last? Outflow periods vary, but consecutive days of withdrawals often suggest sustained caution rather than temporary fluctuations. Should investors worry about these outflows? While noteworthy, outflows represent normal market cycles. Investors should consider their long-term strategy rather than reacting to short-term movements. Can outflows create buying opportunities? Yes, price adjustments during outflow periods sometimes present attractive entry points for patient investors. How do I track Bitcoin spot ETFs performance? Multiple financial platforms and cryptocurrency data providers offer real-time tracking of these funds’ flows and performance. Found this analysis helpful?

Since the US government shutdown ended last week, Atkins's work agenda has evolved into its most intense and decisive yet, according to the latest report from TD Cowen's Washington research team. Analyst Jaret Seiberg stated that Atkins' “deregulatory agenda” covers a wide range of topics, but will focus specifically on new regulatory rules for the crypto sector. The SEC is expected to begin publishing its first draft regulations within the next few months. Analysts believe the process should proceed quickly so that these drafts are completed by 2027 and can be defended and enforced in court by the end of 2028. Related News: More Positive News for Cryptocurrencies from the US - It Was Proposed to Donald Trump At the center of Atkins' agenda is his recently announced “token taxonomy” plan, which aims to provide a new framework for classifying digital assets as securities. According to Seiberg, the SEC could also take significant action regarding tokenized stocks, granting necessary exemptions to online brokers and crypto platforms to facilitate the issuance and trading of such assets. Atkins' agenda isn't limited to crypto. The SEC is also working on a broader deregulatory framework that would make it easier for individual investors to access alternative investments, according to the report. The analysis highlights that the SEC is actively advancing its “Project Crypto” initiative under the new administration, which aims to modernize regulatory rules and support new legislative processes in coordination with Congress. *This is not investment advice.

These remarks often circulate without context or supporting information, and they target new investors who may not fully understand the project or its real-world applications. In a recent video posted to X, Ledger Man (@strivex_) addressed these claims directly. He spoke as both an XRP holder and someone who closely follows Ripple’s progress, and he expressed frustration with the rising disinformation surrounding the asset. THEY SAY $XRP IS DEAD THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO THINK! DON'T SELL YOUR BAGS! pic.twitter.com/Bi3anCWcPH — Ledger Man (@strivex_) November 16, 2025 Why The Claims Do Not Match Ripple’s Actions Ledger Man opened by reminding viewers that he is an XRP bull and that his perspective comes from watching Ripple build aggressively. He argued that those insisting XRP is dead or a scam ignore the most basic facts about Ripple’s long-term strategy. He asked viewers whether they truly believe Ripple would spend billions of dollars acquiring companies and expanding its product stack if XRP had no future. He added that XRP remains a “crucial component of the XRP ecosystem.” He encouraged investors who believe XRP will fail to step aside rather than hold a token they do not understand or trust. He emphasized that Ripple continues to position itself for an evolving financial landscape and said that blockchain adoption by financial institutions is inevitable. To him, the only real question is how much of that future Ripple will help build. Menace Of Misinformation And Market Sentiment Ledger Man expressed clear irritation with persistent claims that XRP will collapse. He said such statements make him angry because they distort Ripple’s effort and discourage new investors from forming their own opinions.

He noted that Bitcoin supporters sometimes target XRP , although he stressed that he respects anyone who prefers to hold Bitcoin without attacking other projects. He argued that crypto investors should understand that the sector as a whole is young with long-term growth potential.. Why XRP Still Holds Strong Potential Despite recent volatility , XRP stands on a meaningful foundation, as Ripple has invested substantial resources into the ecosystem, and the XRP army has strongly backed the digital asset. Ripple is working to solve issues facing many institutions, including outdated infrastructure and the need to replace older settlement processes, and XRP will play a significant role as financial systems modernize.

This persistent trend raises important questions about investor sentiment toward Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds. Why Are ETH ETFs Experiencing Massive Outflows? According to data from Farside Investors, the outflows were primarily driven by two major players in the investment space. BlackRock’s ETHA fund alone accounted for $193 million in outflows, while Fidelity’s FETH contributed an additional $3 million departure. This significant movement suggests institutional investors might be reevaluating their Ethereum positions. However, the picture isn’t entirely bleak. Grayscale’s funds provided some counterbalance to the overall negative trend. The company’s Mini ETH product attracted $10.8 million in inflows, while their ETHE fund saw $2.5 million entering the fund. This indicates that while overall sentiment appears negative, some investors still see value in specific ETH ETF products. What Does This Mean for Ethereum Investors? The consecutive outflows from ETH ETFs could signal several market dynamics at play. Investors should consider these key factors: Market sentiment shift towards alternative cryptocurrencies Profit-taking behavior after recent price movements Portfolio rebalancing by institutional investors Regulatory concerns affecting investment decisions The performance of ETH ETFs often serves as a barometer for institutional confidence in Ethereum. Therefore, this five-day outflow pattern warrants close attention from both retail and institutional market participants. How Can Investors Navigate This ETH ETF Situation? Understanding the reasons behind these ETH ETF movements is crucial for making informed investment decisions. The divergence between different fund providers suggests that investors are becoming more selective about which ETH ETF products they trust with their capital. Grayscale’s ability to attract inflows amid overall outflows indicates that brand reputation and specific fund features might be influencing investor choices. This selective behavior could reshape how ETH ETF providers market their products moving forward. What’s Next for ETH ETFs in This Volatile Market? The cryptocurrency market remains highly sensitive to various external factors. The continued outflows from ETH ETFs might reflect broader market uncertainty or specific concerns about Ethereum’s near-term prospects. However, it’s important to remember that ETF flows represent just one aspect of the overall cryptocurrency ecosystem. Investors should monitor whether this outflow trend continues or reverses in the coming days. A sustained pattern could indicate deeper issues, while a quick recovery might suggest temporary profit-taking behavior. Key Takeaways from the ETH ETF Outflow Data The current situation with ETH ETFs provides valuable insights for cryptocurrency investors. The five-day outflow pattern highlights the importance of diversification and careful fund selection. While BlackRock and Fidelity experienced significant outflows, Grayscale’s ability to attract capital demonstrates that not all ETH ETF products are created equal. This development serves as a reminder that cryptocurrency investments, including ETH ETFs, require continuous monitoring and adjustment based on market conditions and fund-specific performance metrics. Frequently Asked Questions How long have ETH ETFs been experiencing outflows? ETH ETFs have recorded net outflows for five consecutive days as of November 17, with the latest day showing $182.7 million in total net outflows. Which ETH ETF had the largest outflow? BlackRock’s ETHA fund experienced the largest single outflow at $193 million, driving most of the overall negative movement. Did any ETH ETFs see inflows during this period? Yes, Grayscale’s Mini ETH attracted $10.8 million in inflows, while their ETHE fund saw $2.5 million entering, partially offsetting the overall outflows. What do these ETH ETF outflows indicate? The outflows suggest potential profit-taking, shifting market sentiment, or portfolio rebalancing by institutional investors in the Ethereum space. Should I be concerned about my ETH ETF investments? While the outflows warrant attention, they represent short-term movements. Investors should consider their long-term strategy and risk tolerance when evaluating ETH ETF positions. How does this affect Ethereum’s price? ETH ETF flows can influence market sentiment and potentially affect Ethereum’s price, though many other factors also contribute to price movements.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Ethereum price prediction remains a hot topic among investors and traders. With ETH currently navigating market volatility, understanding the potential trajectory through 2030 becomes crucial for making informed investment decisions. The burning question on everyone’s mind: Can Ethereum realistically reach the coveted $10,000 milestone? Current Ethereum Price Analysis and Market Position The Ethereum price today reflects the ongoing market correction, with ETH experiencing a 5.58% decline in the past 24 hours. This downturn highlights the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency market while presenting potential entry points for strategic investors. Ethereum’s fundamental strength lies in its position as the leading smart contract platform, powering decentralized applications and the rapidly expanding DeFi ecosystem. Ethereum Price Prediction 2025: The Road to $6,925 Our Ethereum price prediction for 2025 suggests a potential surge to $6,925, driven by several key factors. The continued adoption of blockchain technology across industries, Ethereum 2.0 upgrades improving scalability, and growing institutional interest in digital assets could propel ETH to new heights. The convergence of these elements creates a compelling case for substantial growth within the next two years. Key Drivers for 2025 Growth Ethereum 2.0 full implementation and improved transaction efficiency Expanding DeFi and NFT markets built on Ethereum Increased institutional adoption of ETH as a digital asset Regulatory clarity boosting investor confidence ETH Price Trajectory Through 2026-2028 The ETH price evolution between 2026 and 2028 will likely be influenced by broader cryptocurrency market trends and technological advancements. As blockchain technology becomes more integrated into traditional finance and enterprise applications, Ethereum’s utility and value proposition could strengthen significantly. Market analysts project steady growth during this period, setting the stage for the 2030 targets. Year Conservative Prediction Moderate Prediction Optimistic Prediction 2026 $4,200 $5,800 $7,500 2027 $5,100 $7,200 $9,400 2028 $6,300 $8,900 $11,800 Ethereum Price Prediction 2030: The $15,575 Horizon Looking further ahead, our Ethereum price prediction for 2030 indicates a potential high of $15,575. This ambitious target depends on several critical developments in the cryptocurrency market and broader technology landscape. The maturation of Web3 infrastructure, mass adoption of decentralized applications, and Ethereum’s continued dominance in the smart contract space could drive this substantial valuation increase. Can ETH Realistically Reach $10,000? The question of whether Ethereum can reach $10,000 hinges on multiple variables. Current analysis suggests this milestone is achievable by 2028-2029, with the $10k mark representing a significant psychological barrier for the cryptocurrency market. Several factors will determine if and when ETH crosses this threshold: Sustained network growth and transaction volume Successful implementation of all Ethereum 2.0 phases Global regulatory environment for digital assets Competitive landscape and Ethereum’s market share retention Macroeconomic factors affecting the entire cryptocurrency sector Challenges and Risks in Ethereum Investment While the Ethereum price prediction appears promising, investors must consider potential challenges. The cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile, and regulatory uncertainties could impact growth. Competition from other blockchain platforms, technological hurdles in scaling solutions, and broader economic conditions all present risks to the projected ETH price trajectory. Actionable Insights for Ethereum Investors For those considering Ethereum investment based on these predictions, several strategies can help navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market. Dollar-cost averaging reduces timing risk, while thorough research into Ethereum’s technology and ecosystem provides fundamental understanding. Diversification across different digital assets and careful risk management remain essential principles for long-term success. FAQs: Ethereum Price Prediction What factors most influence Ethereum’s price? Ethereum’s price is influenced by network adoption, technological upgrades, market sentiment, regulatory developments, and broader cryptocurrency trends. How accurate are long-term cryptocurrency predictions? Long-term predictions in the volatile cryptocurrency market should be viewed as educated estimates rather than guarantees, as numerous unpredictable factors can affect outcomes. What makes Ethereum different from other cryptocurrencies? Ethereum’s programmable smart contract functionality and established developer ecosystem distinguish it from purely transactional digital assets like Bitcoin. Should I invest in Ethereum based on these predictions? Investment decisions should consider personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and thorough research rather than relying solely on price predictions. Conclusion: The Future of Ethereum Investment The Ethereum price prediction through 2030 presents an exciting yet realistic outlook for one of the most prominent digital assets. While the path to $10,000 and beyond contains both opportunities and challenges, Ethereum’s fundamental strengths and growing adoption suggest substantial long-term potential. As the cryptocurrency market matures and blockchain technology becomes increasingly integrated into global systems, ETH’s position appears strong for the coming years.

UN Security Council’s backing of a new Gaza peace framework to Bitcoin’s renewed downturn, SoftBank’s deepening push into AI chip infrastructure, and the US House’s mounting drive to force the release of Jeffrey Epstein files. UN endorses Trump-backed Gaza peace framework amid Israeli resistance The UN Security Council has approved a resolution supporting proposals put forward by US President Donald Trump for a long-term peace process in Gaza. Passed with a 13–0 vote and abstentions from Russia and China, the measure endorses an international stabilisation force (ISF) and outlines a potential path toward a sovereign Palestinian state. Support for Palestinian statehood was a key concession to secure backing from Arab and Islamic nations, who are expected to provide peacekeepers. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his opposition to Palestinian statehood just hours before the vote, raising uncertainty about the resolution’s future. Hamas also rejected the plan, describing it as an “international guardianship mechanism” and vowing not to disarm. The resolution establishes oversight via a “board of peace,” chaired by Trump, though its membership and authority remain unclear. Questions also linger over the ISF’s mandate, the viability of disarming Hamas, and the formation of a Palestinian technocratic committee to manage Gaza’s governance. Despite its ambiguities, the vote marks a rare moment of unified UN action after two years of diplomatic gridlock. Bitcoin slides below $90,000 as macroeconomic pressures mount Bitcoin has fallen below the $90,000 threshold for the first time since April , deepening a month-long decline that has erased its gains for 2025. The token traded near $89,928 after dropping as much as 5% in 24 hours, extending its retreat from October’s record above $126,000. Shifting expectations for US monetary policy, particularly fading odds of a December rate cut, have weighed on risk assets. The selloff follows an early-October rout that triggered over $19 billion in liquidations and erased $1 trillion in crypto market value. Retail investors have pulled back sharply, and companies with large crypto treasuries face growing pressure as prices fall below acquisition levels. Options markets indicate increased demand for downside protection, with puts at $85,000 and $80,000 dominating flows. XRP has mirrored Bitcoin’s weakness, slipping below key support levels and showing limited signs of recovery. FTC ends review of SoftBank’s $6.5B Ampere acquisition The US Federal Trade Commission has ended its review of SoftBank’s $6.5 billion acquisition of semiconductor designer Ampere Computing, clearing a regulatory hurdle for the deal. The early termination signals the end of an investigation that had previously expanded into an in-depth probe. The acquisition strengthens SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son’s strategy to consolidate critical AI chip infrastructure. SoftBank already controls Arm Holdings and holds stakes in other chip design firms, including Graphcore, positioning the conglomerate at the center of global AI hardware development. House set for vote to release Epstein Records The US House is preparing to vote on legislation compelling the Justice Department to release all unclassified records related to Jeffrey Epstein. The measure has gained significant bipartisan support, bolstered by Trump’s sudden reversal in favor of the bill. A veto-proof majority is now possible, putting pressure on Senate Republicans to advance the legislation. The move follows years of scrutiny over Epstein’s network and the handling of previous investigations. The bill includes provisions to protect victim identities, while the House Oversight Committee continues to release thousands of DOJ documents tied to the case.

Analysts from The Bull Theory examined the underlying causes of this behavior and identified significant issues causing such poor performance in what was expected to be a bullish fourth quarter for the industry. Market Liquidity Stumbles Post-October 10 Sell-Off One of the primary factors cited is the severe damage inflicted on market liquidity following the dramatic sell-off on October 10, which resulted in more than $20 billion liquidated from traders in a matter of minutes. This particularly impacted altcoins, with many seeing losses of 70% to 80%. With liquidity diminished, the current market environment allows prices to fluctuate easily, meaning even minor sell-offs can lead to rapid price drops. The analysts noted that the liquidity has failed to recover since this initial dump, resulting in the order books for major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) becoming increasingly sparse. Related Reading: The ‘Insanely Bullish’ Dogecoin Setup That Will Trigger A 600% Rally To $1 The consequences of this thin liquidity are stark; a small volume of selling can generate significant downward price movements. This observation matches the reality of recent market activity, where price declines appear more pronounced than the actual selling volume. Another contributing factor to the downturn, as pointed out by market analyst Tom Lee, is the behavior of major market makers. According to Lee, the ongoing correction may stem from one or two large entities facing considerable losses. Layered upon these issues is the excessive leverage in the market. Despite the unprecedented liquidations, many traders have reportedly returned to the market with increased leverage. The Bull Theory analysts contend that this high leverage, coupled with thin markets, enables market makers to trigger substantial liquidations with minimal price movement, making the sell-offs appear more aggressive. Crypto Fear Index Hits Lowest Level In Over 3 Years Compounding these issues, market sentiment has been plagued by fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). Current narratives circulating, such as speculation regarding Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) facing forced liquidations if Bitcoin falls below $74,000, further exacerbate panic. It is worth noting that during the 2020-2021 cycle, Strategy’s cost basis hovered around $30,000 to $32,000. Even when Bitcoin dipped to $16,000—almost 50% below their cost—the company did not sell any coins. The Fear Index has also plummeted to 10, a level not seen in over three and a half years. The analysts belive that such extreme fear suggests two potential scenarios: either the market has reached its bottom, or it is approaching it. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Ethereum Price Is Crashing Again, Can It Breach $3,000? In conjunction with these sentiment measures, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Bitcoin has returned to levels comparable to those of January 2023, when Bitcoin was valued around $20,000. The analysts suggest that this signals a stretched market on the downside, particularly within altcoins, where speculative activity has diminished and retail interest is waning. Despite the current turmoil, the Bull Theory analysts find that fundamentally, little has changed within the crypto market. They highlighted that Bitcoin’s network remains robust, with increasing hashrate, ongoing institutional interest, and a supportive stance from the US government regarding regulated crypto. However, it remains to be seen what the eventual direction of the digital asset market will be, as neither negative nor bullish cycles follow straight lines. This suggests that despite the downtrend, a new recovery and future dips may occur, and vice versa. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was leading Monday’s crypto market drop, trading at $91,940—a 3% drop within 24 hours and a 13% drop within a week.

The investigation alleges that money launderers, linked to drug trafficking, Southeast Asian scam centers, and North Korean hackers, have been leveraging major exchanges to facilitate their illicit operations. Crypto Money Laundering Operations Linked To Huione Group The ICIJ’s analysis highlights that, as recently as July 2025, the Huione Group, a Cambodian financial entity flagged by US authorities as a “primary money laundering concern,” transferred approximately $1 million worth of Tether’s USDT stablecoin daily to accounts at Binance . This flow amounted to over $408 million from Huione to Binance customer accounts between July 2024 and July 2025. Notably, these transactions allegedly occurred while Huione was under the supervision of two court-appointed monitors, established as part of Binance’s plea deal with US regulators in November 2023. The report goes on to reveal that at least $226 million also shifted into accounts at OKX, another major crypto exchange, during the five months following OKX’s guilty plea in February for operating an unlicensed money transmitter . ICIJ’s report also explores a network of cash desks and courier services that operate in cities such as Hong Kong, Toronto, London, and Istanbul, allowing individuals to anonymously convert cryptocurrency outside the view of financial authorities. These locations have emerged as largely unregulated hotspots for laundering money. In a separate investigation, ICIJ examined an alleged pyramid scheme orchestrated by Vladimir Okhotnikov, who is accused of misappropriating at least $340 million from investors between 2020 and 2022 through a fraudulent investment platform . Insufficient Regulatory Oversight? The report highlighted that these illicit transactions often traverse anonymous digital wallets and tools like “swappers,” which enable users to automatically exchange cryptocurrencies without identity verification, complicating law enforcement efforts to trace illicit activities . A dozen former compliance employees from major exchanges, including OKX and Binance, reported to ICIJ that they struggle to keep pace with “increasingly sophisticated criminals.” Regulators around the world are responsible for ensuring that cryptocurrency firms comply with anti-money laundering laws . However, the report asserts that the current landscape is characterized by “fragmented enforcement,” resulting in “insufficient oversight,” according to the ICIJ. According to ICIJ’s findings, authorities have imposed at least $5.8 billion in fines and penalties against cryptocurrency exchanges. Meanwhile, consumer and business losses from crypto-related crimes are escalating. In the United States alone, the FBI estimates that Americans lost approximately $9.3 billion to crypto crimes in 2024, a 67% increase from the previous year.

In this article, we break down the latest news related to the cross-border token and the company behind it. Which ETF Comes Next? The first spot XRP ETF in the US to fully track the performance of the cryptocurrency began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market last week. The product, dubbed XRPC, was launched by Canary Capital and had a very successful debut day, generating almost $60 million in trading volume. Numerous other spot XRP ETFs are also on the line for approval and could go live in the near future. Just a few days ago, Eric Balchunas (the Senior ETF expert at Bloomberg) claimed that under its new guidance, the SEC has made it easier for companies to speed up the effectiveness of their filings. He believes Bitwise’s XRP ETF might be the next to see the light of day. The XRP Army has a rather different viewpoint on the matter. X user STEPH IS CRYPTO thinks Franklin Templeton’s spot XRP ETF would go live later today (November 18). These funds simplify the investment process for people as they allow them to gain direct exposure to Ripple’s cross-border token via a regulated way and without having to worry about safeguarding their holdings. According to many analysts, this may increase the interest in XRP and trigger a price rally. XRP Price Outlook Despite the positive news on the ETF front, XRP has bled out heavily in the past week, losing over 15% of its valuation and currently trading at around $2.16 (per CoinGecko’s data). This comes at a time when the entire crypto market was hit by another correction, with Bitcoin (BTC) tanking below $95,000. X user Ali Martinez described $2.15 as “the line in the sand” for XRP. He believes the asset may rebound to the $2.40 – $2.70 range as long as it holds that level. Whales Continue to Sell One possible factor (besides the bleeding market) negatively impacting XRP’s recent performance is the whale exodus. At one point, large investors offloaded approximately 1.4 billion tokens in the span of just a month. A few days ago, market participants dumped an additional 200 million coins (worth more than $440 million at current rates) over a 48-hour period . The continuous sell-off results in an influx of tokens available on the market, which, combined with non-increasing demand, should lead to a price decline. Additionally, it may scare smaller players, who could mimic their move. Scam Warnings Fraudsters have been quite active as of late, particularly targeting members of the Ripple community. Last week, the team sounded the alarm that wrongdoers use fake Ripple or XRP livestreams, giveaways, or deepfake videos. Their goal is to lure unsuspecting people into sending their funds to fraudulent addresses by promising significant returns or special rewards. Ripple assured that its staff will never ask users to transfer assets, share wallet data, or join investment streams. It also advised people always to verify information through the official channels of the entity. Shortly after, another alert went live, indicating that the team had seen a surge in fake “live” YouTube videos during and after its annual conference, Swell. The event took place earlier in November in New York City.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-next-leg-up-is-likely-to-be-parabolic-heres-why/,"ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA), a well-known market analyst, has returned with a new assessment of XRP’s long-term setup. His analysis focuses on a bull flag forming above the digital asset’s 2021 highs. A bull flag or pennant is a notable bullish signal, and the analyst believes it deserves close attention. He noted that “$2 is foundational support” and marked a breakout target near $20. His chart shows XRP holding within a tightening formation after a sharp move earlier in the year. In late 2024, XRP began a historic rally, rising by over 500%. This move culminated in January, when XRP reached $3.39, forming the flagpole for the current technical setup. $XRP : Zooming into the fractal, the bull flag/pennant structure holding above the 2021 highs should not be ignored. $20 breakout target. $2 is foundational support. https://t.co/BPwEPE9mZs pic.twitter.com/W3jaP2gfBh — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) November 16, 2025 The Bull Flag Structure The post introduces a clear visual of the pattern. The flag sits above $1.96, a level that capped XRP in 2021 . Its price now treats that region as support. The chart shows the candles compressed between two trend lines that mark the flag boundaries. ChartNerd sees the setup as a constructive period of consolidation. The current zone shows reduced volatility within the flag and an orderly pullback, both of which fit the standard criteria for a continuation structure. XRP broke out of this structure in July, reaching an all-time high of $3.65 . However, the asset failed to sustain this momentum. It has remained within the bull flag since then, but ChartNerd believes another breakout is on the horizon. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Where Is XRP Going Next? The candles on the chart show higher support than in earlier cycles. The shift above the 2021 highs signals a potential change in long-term direction. XRP traded at $2.22 at the time of his analysis, sitting firmly above the support level . Based on the bull flag pattern, ChartNerd set a target of $20.46. This level is 821.6% higher than the digital asset’s current price. Although it is an ambitious target, it is supported by the measured move method, which calculates the target based on the flagpole. The pole’s height matches the potential follow-through, and the asset’s price would need to clear the upper trend line firmly for confirmation. This setup aligns with the analyst’s prior view that XRP’s next rally will be parabolic . For now, XRP remains inside the flag with clear boundaries. The focus stays on the $2 support and the upper trend line that defines the resistance. The target sits far above the current range, but the structure provides a clear framework for evaluating the next move.

Recent data reveals a surprising trend in Bitcoin perpetual futures across major exchanges, with short positions gaining significant ground. This development could signal important shifts in market sentiment that every crypto investor should understand. What Do Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Tell Us About Market Sentiment? Bitcoin perpetual futures provide crucial insights into trader positioning and market expectations. The current aggregate data shows shorts holding a clear advantage at 52.5% compared to 47.5% long positions. This imbalance across the top three exchanges indicates growing bearish sentiment among sophisticated traders. Understanding these Bitcoin perpetual futures ratios helps investors gauge market temperature. When shorts dominate, it often suggests traders expect downward price pressure. However, this can also create conditions for short squeezes if the market moves unexpectedly upward. Breaking Down the Exchange-Specific Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Data Let’s examine how each major exchange contributes to the overall Bitcoin perpetual futures picture: Binance : 47.06% long vs 52.94% short Bybit : 48.8% long vs 51.2% short Gate.io : 49.55% long vs 50.45% short Interestingly, Gate.io shows the most balanced Bitcoin perpetual futures ratio, while Binance demonstrates the strongest short bias. These variations highlight how different trading communities approach Bitcoin perpetual futures with varying strategies and risk appetites. Why Should Bitcoin Investors Care About These Ratios? Bitcoin perpetual futures data serves as a valuable sentiment indicator. When shorts dominate Bitcoin perpetual futures, it often precedes increased volatility. Traders positioning themselves in Bitcoin perpetual futures are typically more sophisticated and may anticipate market moves before retail investors. However, extreme positioning in Bitcoin perpetual futures can also signal contrarian opportunities. Heavy short interest might indicate potential for rapid price appreciation if unexpected positive news emerges. Monitoring these Bitcoin perpetual futures metrics helps investors stay ahead of market trends. Actionable Insights From Current Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Trends The current Bitcoin perpetual futures landscape suggests several strategic considerations. First, the short dominance indicates cautious professional sentiment. Second, the consistency across exchanges strengthens the signal’s reliability. Finally, the relatively close ratios suggest the market isn’t at extreme sentiment levels yet. Investors watching Bitcoin perpetual futures should consider these factors when making trading decisions. The data provides context but shouldn’t be used in isolation. Combine Bitcoin perpetual futures analysis with other technical and fundamental indicators for comprehensive market assessment. Navigating the Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Landscape Successful traders understand that Bitcoin perpetual futures data represents one piece of the puzzle. While the current short dominance in Bitcoin perpetual futures suggests bearish expectations, markets can change rapidly. The key is monitoring how these Bitcoin perpetual futures ratios evolve over time and in response to market events. Remember that Bitcoin perpetual futures represent derivative positions, not spot market activity. This distinction matters because futures traders often have different time horizons and risk profiles than long-term Bitcoin holders. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin perpetual futures? Bitcoin perpetual futures are derivative contracts that track Bitcoin’s price without an expiration date, allowing traders to speculate on price movements indefinitely. Why do short positions matter in Bitcoin trading? Short positions indicate traders expect prices to fall. High short interest can signal bearish sentiment and potentially lead to increased market volatility. How often do these Bitcoin perpetual futures ratios change? These ratios update continuously as traders open and close positions. Significant shifts can occur within hours during volatile market conditions. Should retail investors follow Bitcoin perpetual futures data? While helpful for context, retail investors should use multiple indicators and consider their investment horizon before making decisions based solely on futures data. What’s the difference between perpetual futures and regular futures? Perpetual futures lack expiration dates and use funding mechanisms to maintain price alignment with spot markets, unlike traditional futures with set settlement dates. Can high short interest be positive for Bitcoin prices? Yes, extreme short positions can create conditions for short squeezes, where rising prices force short sellers to cover positions, accelerating upward moves.

Key Takeaways: AMINA became the first international bank approved in Hong Kong to offer institutional crypto trading and custody. The license follows a 233% surge in Hong Kong crypto trading volumes. It also positions AMINA to expand into funds, derivatives and tokenized assets. In a Monday press release , the bank said the Securities and Futures Commission granted a “Type 1 license uplift,” allowing AMINA to serve a segment of the market that has struggled to access compliant, bank-grade crypto services under Hong Kong’s strict regulatory regime. With the approval, AMINA’s Hong Kong unit can now offer trading and custody for 13 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, USDC, Tether and several major DeFi tokens. AMINA Eyes Expansion as Hong Kong Crypto Trading Surges 233% The move comes amid rapid market growth in the region: AMINA reported a 233% increase in trading volume on Hong Kong crypto exchanges during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period last year. Michael Benz, AMINA’s Hong Kong head, said the license positions the firm to expand into private fund management, structured products, derivatives and tokenized real-world assets. These areas are expected to form the next wave of institutional demand in Hong Kong as the city accelerates its push to attract global digital-asset businesses. Hong Kong has been actively courting international crypto firms, pitching itself as a regulated alternative to markets with less clarity. While AMINA is the first foreign bank to obtain the enhanced Type 1 permission, it joins an ecosystem already served by local players such as Tiger Brokers and HashKey. Crypto trading and custody – now available at AMINA Hong Kong! Today, AMINA becomes the first international banking group to launch comprehensive crypto trading and custody services in Hong Kong. What this means for institutions, corporates, family offices, and UHNWI… pic.twitter.com/74EtwDV9Bs — AMINA Bank (@AMINABankGlobal) November 18, 2025 The approval aligns with a broader regulatory shift. In August, Hong Kong introduced long-awaited stablecoin rules, prompting major banks such as HSBC and ICBC to consider licensing. The SFC also approved its first Solana ETF in October , ahead of the United States, as part of its effort to expand the city’s crypto investment offerings. Despite tightening certain self-custody rules to curb cybersecurity risks, regulators have continued signaling an openness to responsible digital-asset growth. AMINA’s entry adds fresh momentum to Hong Kong’s effort to cement its status as a global hub for institutional crypto finance. Hong Kong to Open Crypto Trading to Global Liquidity As reported, Hong Kong is preparing a major overhaul of its crypto trading rules , allowing licensed exchanges to connect with global order books for the first time. The change, announced by SFC Chief Executive Julia Leung during Hong Kong Fintech Week, will end the city’s isolated trading model and align digital asset rules with those used across traditional financial markets. The move is part of a broader push to strengthen Hong Kong’s role as a regional crypto hub. Since 2022, the city has introduced exchange licensing, approved Bitcoin and Ether-linked investment products and begun shaping a digital-asset fund ecosystem. Despite these efforts, Hong Kong’s trading volumes still trail markets like the United States, prompting regulators to refine their approach while maintaining strict investor protections. Alongside the new liquidity rules, Hong Kong is finalizing licensing frameworks for crypto dealers, custodians and stablecoin issuers. Regulators may also let licensed brokers, not just exchanges, tap into global liquidity pools, potentially offering easier entry routes for international platforms such as Binance or Coinbase.

The country’s Bitcoin office reports that it now holds 7,474 Bitcoin (approximately $688 million) in reserve. Based on the latest publicly available data, the Central American nation’s BTC accumulation continues — but at a much slower, incremental pace. El Salvador buys Bitcoin every day to grow its reserves President Nayib Bukele posted a screenshot on X that showed the amount of Bitcoin his government purchased over the past week and wrote “Hooah!” to celebrate the buy. Bukele wants the world to see that the country will grow its reserve by holding BTC for the long term , rather than chasing quick profits from sudden price swings. El Salvador has been adding one token to its reserve every day to capitalize on price dips and reduce the average cost of its Bitcoin over time. The government believes in the long-term value of digital assets and aims to establish a robust financial foundation for its future using BTC. The director of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office, Stacy Herbert, stated that the government is purchasing Bitcoin daily to provide individuals with greater control over their finances, thereby reducing their reliance on traditional banking institutions. Most Salvadorians use the U.S. dollar for daily shopping and payments, so the government wants its people to stop relying on the currency and learn about how to use Bitcoin. El Salvador was the first country worldwide to make Bitcoin a legal tender in 2021, but adoption has been really slow because most people still prefer using the dollar. The International Monetary Fund even warned the country about the risks of holding large amounts of Bitcoin. Still, the government continued to buy BTC daily, as it believed in its future in the financial sector. Bitcoin price has gone down, but El Salvador continues to buy The price of Bitcoin went below $90,000 this week and even dropped by almost 5% in just one day. This sudden drop shocked small investors who had held BTC for only a few months, and many of them rushed to sell their coins to avoid further losses. Their rash actions became the biggest short-term selling event since April 2025, as approximately 148,000 BTC changed ownership, causing the prices to fall even further. Investors were panicking and selling at a big loss, but El Salvador remained calm and continued to buy BTC every day. The government of El Salvador has set an example for other countries, as the Czech National Bank also recently announced that it bought its first BTC and other digital assets. However, even if other governments purchase Bitcoins and help the market improve slightly, they cannot prevent small investors from panic-selling. Hence, prices continue to fall, and the market remains highly sensitive to new news. El Salvador now has one of the largest government BTC reserves in the world, with 7,474.37 Bitcoin (approximately $688 million). DropsTab reported that the country’s holdings have already generated unrealized profits of nearly $264.6 million, demonstrating the significant long-term benefits of accumulating BTC. El Salvador is now the fifth-largest holder of Bitcoin , after the United States, China, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. The country has a modest economy compared to these global powers, but it has stood out due to its aggressive yet calculated strategy for digital assets. Some people argue that holding Bitcoin for too long can have more risks than benefits, but Bukele remains consistent with his purchases because he believes in the long-term future of BTC for his country.

Key Takeaways: VanEck has launched the third US Solana staking ETF, joining Bitwise and Grayscale as inflows into Solana-linked funds accelerate. VSOL offers staking rewards and a temporary zero-fee structure, intensifying competition. Fidelity’s Solana ETF set to debut next and multiple Dogecoin ETF filings nearing potential launch windows. The VanEck Solana ETF (VSOL) went live on Monday , joining similar staking-enabled Solana ETFs from Bitwise and Grayscale, which have collectively attracted more than $380 million since their late-October debuts. VanEck Waives Fees on New Solana Staking ETF to Capture Market Share VSOL mirrors its competitors by offering staking rewards on Solana, allowing investors to earn yield while holding the asset inside the ETF structure. In a push to gain market share quickly, VanEck has waived its 0.3% management fee until February 17 or until the fund amasses $1 billion in assets. The launch comes amid a rush by issuers to introduce new crypto products after the SEC’s September rule change streamlined the approval process and removed the need for case-by-case reviews. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said the lineup is expanding rapidly, with Fidelity’s Solana ETF (FSOL) set to debut on Tuesday. FSOL enters a field where most funds charge around 0.25%, and Balchunas noted that Fidelity is the largest asset manager in the category, with BlackRock notably absent from the Solana race so far. More altcoin ETFs are lining up behind the Solana wave. A Dogecoin ETF from Grayscale could launch as early as November 24, following an amended filing that triggered a 20-day window in which the product can go live unless the SEC intervenes. Based on 20 day clock I believe Grayscale will be out with first Doge ETF in a week, 11/24. We'll see, won't be 100% till exchange notice, but based on SEC guidance it looks good. pic.twitter.com/mvlGsNyNVG — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 17, 2025 The fund is a conversion of the existing Grayscale Dogecoin Trust and would trade on the New York Stock Exchange, pending final approval from the exchange. If launched, it would become the first US ETF able to directly hold Dogecoin. The only existing DOGE-themed ETF, issued by REX Shares and Osprey Funds in September, is limited to holding the asset through an offshore subsidiary due to its structure under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Bitwise could soon join the Dogecoin ETF race, with a filing update earlier this month also triggering a potential late-November launch. The growing list of altcoin ETFs reflects increasing competition among issuers hoping to capture inflows beyond Bitcoin and Ether as the market broadens. Digital Asset Products See $2B Outflows As reported, digital asset investment products suffered their heaviest weekly outflows since February, with $2 billion exiting the market last week. The sell-off marked the third consecutive week of withdrawals, bringing total outflows over the period to $3.2 billion. The slump follows sharp price declines across major cryptocurrencies, which have pushed total assets under management in digital asset ETPs down 27% from their early-October peak of $264 billion to $191 billion. Analysts cited ongoing monetary policy uncertainty and aggressive selling from crypto-native whale wallets as the main drivers behind the downturn. The US accounted for the overwhelming share of outflows, with $1.97 billion leaving U.S.-based products. Switzerland and Hong Kong followed at a distance, recording $39.9 million and $12.3 million in outflows.

Are you wondering if Solana’s SOL token can hit the remarkable $500 milestone? As one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in the market, Solana has captured the attention of investors worldwide. This comprehensive Solana price prediction analysis examines whether SOL can achieve this ambitious target by 2025 and beyond, exploring the technical fundamentals and market dynamics that could drive its growth. Understanding Solana Price Prediction Fundamentals Solana’s unique blockchain technology positions it for potential growth. The network’s high transaction speed and low costs make it attractive for developers and users. When analyzing SOL price movements, several factors come into play.

Szabo’s distinction struck at a core belief held by many BTC proponents and comes at a time when there’s a fierce technical debate over how to handle this legal risk that is threatening to split the network. The Legal Reality of Trust-Minimized Systems The cryptographer’s comments, made across a series of posts on X, challenged the idealized view of Bitcoin as a system entirely immune to state interference. He argued that while its base layer can withstand more interference than centralized systems, it is not a “magical anarcho-capitalist Swiss army knife.” According to Szabo, there are two primary legal fronts. The first is financial law, which has been largely managed by the industry’s legal experts. The second, he believes, is far more dangerous: the unpredictable and vast legal territory surrounding arbitrary data. “The crypto industry does not have the legal expertise to deal with it,” he wrote. He specifically highlighted that Bitcoin archive nodes, which store the blockchain’s entire history, cannot selectively delete data without breaking their core financial function, making them vulnerable to legal demands for content removal. While the discussion is theoretical, it has a very real technical counterpart. Recently, a section of Bitcoin developers proposed a code change to limit the amount of non-financial data that can be stored on the blockchain, known as BIP-444. First published in October, the proposal is a direct reaction to the Bitcoin Core 30 update from June, which increased the data limit for OP_RETURN transactions from 80 bytes to nearly 4 MB. Supporters of BIP-444, such as Luke Dashjr, argued that allowing large data storage creates legal risks, including the potential for illegal content to be permanently embedded in the blockchain. However, the proposal’s language, which warns of “legal or moral consequences” for those who reject it, sparked some community backlash, with critics calling it coercive. Community Divided Over Hypothetical Risks Reactions on X to Szabo’s comments have been varied. Coinjoined Chris, co-founder and CEO of crypto storage platform Seedor, contended that Szabo is “giving too much weight to speculative legal boogeymen,” saying Bitcoin’s strength lies in minimizing technical choke points, not trying to predict every content law on earth. If regulators could simply outlaw generic data transmission, he argued, they would have killed PGP and Tor “decades ago,” and trimming Bitcoin’s generality out of fear only makes it easier to capture. Szabo hit back that he is talking about “very real laws in very real jurisdictions” and that node operators, unlike operators of forums or messaging platforms, cannot simply remove offending data. Meanwhile, macro-minded commentators like J.P. Mayall placed the clash in a broader adoption story, comparing crypto’s estimated 7% to 8% global penetration today with Christianity’s growth once it was legalized in the Roman Empire. In response, Dashjr offered a darker twist: if legalization once multiplied Christianity’s reach, making Bitcoin illegal could, by the same logic, cut its user base to a fraction.

Our comprehensive Bitcoin price prediction analysis examines multiple factors that could drive the world’s leading cryptocurrency to unprecedented heights between 2025 and 2030. What Factors Influence Bitcoin Price Prediction? Understanding Bitcoin price movements requires analyzing several key drivers. The BTC price doesn’t move in isolation—it responds to specific market conditions and fundamental factors. Halving events and supply reduction Institutional adoption rates Regulatory developments worldwide Macroeconomic conditions and inflation Technological advancements and network upgrades Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025: The Post-Halving Surge Historical patterns suggest that Bitcoin typically experiences significant growth approximately 12-18 months after each halving event. The 2024 halving sets the stage for potential explosive growth in 2025. Our cryptocurrency forecast indicates that BTC price could reach between $120,000 and $150,000 during this period, driven by reduced supply issuance and increasing institutional demand. Scenario Conservative Moderate Bullish 2025 Prediction $90,000 $120,000 $180,000 Key Drivers Institutional flows ETF adoption Global macro crisis BTC Price Outlook 2026-2028: The Consolidation Phase Following potential 2025 peaks, the BTC price often enters a consolidation period. This phase allows the market to absorb previous gains while building foundations for the next major move. Our crypto market analysis suggests this period will see Bitcoin establishing stronger support levels while continuing its gradual upward trajectory. Cryptocurrency Forecast 2029-2030: The Next Frontier Looking toward the end of the decade, several converging factors could propel Bitcoin to remarkable levels. The Bitcoin 2030 outlook considers technological maturity, broader global adoption, and potential scarcity value as key drivers. Some analysts project BTC price could reach $500,000 or higher by 2030, though these predictions remain highly speculative. Why Bitcoin 2030 Predictions Matter Today Long-term Bitcoin price prediction isn’t just about numbers—it’s about understanding the fundamental shift happening in global finance. The cryptocurrency forecast for 2030 reflects Bitcoin’s potential role as a global reserve asset and store of value. Early investors who understand this trajectory position themselves advantageously for the coming financial transformation. Common Questions About Bitcoin Price Prediction What is the most reliable Bitcoin price prediction method? Most analysts combine multiple approaches including stock-to-flow models, on-chain metrics, technical analysis, and fundamental factors. No single method guarantees accuracy, but consensus among different models provides stronger signals. How does institutional adoption affect BTC price? Institutional involvement through companies like MicroStrategy and ETF approvals create substantial buying pressure while reducing circulating supply. This structural shift fundamentally changes Bitcoin’s price discovery mechanism. What role does regulation play in cryptocurrency forecast accuracy? Regulatory clarity from entities like the SEC and international bodies significantly impacts market stability and institutional participation. Positive regulatory developments typically correlate with price appreciation. How accurate have past Bitcoin price predictions been? Historical accuracy varies widely. While some analysts like PlanB gained attention for relatively accurate models, most predictions should be viewed as educated estimates rather than guarantees. The Final Verdict on Bitcoin’s Future The journey toward 2030 presents extraordinary opportunities for Bitcoin investors. While short-term volatility remains inevitable, the long-term trajectory appears strongly positive. Our Bitcoin price prediction analysis suggests that patient investors who understand Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition could see remarkable returns over the coming years. The convergence of technological innovation, institutional adoption, and global macroeconomic trends creates a perfect storm for Bitcoin’s continued ascent.

The chart pattern was highlighted by crypto analyst Melikatrader on a TradingView post, showing that there could be a reversal coming for Dogecoin soon. The analysis further explains how the formation came about and what this could mean for the meme coin’s price as another week of trading gets underway in the current bearish environment. Understand The Dogecoin Macro Cup And Handle Pattern Interestingly, the formation of the macro cup and handle pattern didn’t just start recently, as is usually the case. The crypto analyst explains that this formation had begun years ago, back in 2021, when the Dogecoin price had staged its legendary 36,000% rally that pushed it to new all-time highs. Related Reading: Analyst Breaks Down Why There Can’t Be 7 Million XRP Holders It comes after what was perhaps the strongest pole and flag rally in the Dogecoin price history, pushing it to new heights in the process. However, this led to the formation of a multi-year-long cup and handle pattern, with the cup portion of the pattern being in formation since 2021. This large cup formation points to long-term accumulation for the Dogecoin price. Now, according to the analyst, the cup has been completed, leaving the handle pattern that is now underway. As part of this, the Dogecoin price is now trading inside of a descending handle, and this is where the bullish part comes in. This is because a descending bullish handle has often appeared as a precursor to a bullish price breakout. Why DOGE Price Could Hit $4 With the formation of the handle pattern already starting, it now remains for the completion of the bullish trend. As long as the Dogecoin price is able to break out of the descending handle, then it would set the tone for the upward reversal for the meme coin. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Falling Because Of Strategy Sell-Offs? On-Chain Data Fuels Debate The major thing about this bullish handle is the fact that the breakout could last into multiple years. This multi-year expansion phase could see the continuous increase of the price as Dogecoin makes its way back toward its $0.74 all-time highs that were set back in 2021. However, this would not be the end of the uptrend, as the crypto analyst explains that the completion of the cup and handle pattern puts the price much higher. The target puts the lower and more conservative end at $2.8. But a 2,400% expansion is still possible, pushing the price as high as $4 before the trend is complete.

Gox has transferred large amounts of bitcoin, 10,422.6 BTC ($936 million), to a new wallet address on Tuesday, according to Arkham data . The transfer comes after eight months of dormancy and is part of its ongoing creditor repayment process. The move marks the exchange’s major activity from its holdings since March. The last recorded activity saw Mt. Gox transfer 11,834 BTC to an unknown wallet , worth over $1 billion. Per Arkham, the beleaguered crypto firm’s wallet still holds around 34,689 BTC, valued at about $3.12 billion. The timing of the latest transfer coincides with a period of high volatility in the crypto market . After 8 months of inactivity, Mt. Gox just transferred 10,423 $BTC ($936M) to a new wallet. https://t.co/wKkooF4WWR pic.twitter.com/FtMCnDXcm2 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 18, 2025 Wallet Activity Resurfaces – Can Creditor Payouts Lead to Large Selloff? The recent wallet activity has sparked market anxiety over potential selling pressure. The transfer quickly caught the attention of market watchers, thought the funds have not moved again. Analysts and traders note that such mass transfers alone do not create selling pressure. One user said that the Mt. Gox BTC transfer is not a sell-off, but just cold-hot wallet movements. “This is not market selling, just preparation. Real sell pressure only starts if coins move from the hot wallet to exchanges.” Another analyst noted that though moving 10,423 BTC looks “scary,” the market has been expecting this for years. “Transfers alone don’t create selling pressure; they just reset where coins sit,” the analyst’s X post read . Mt. Gox collapsed in 2014 after suffering a massive hack that resulted in the loss of 850,000 BTC, marking one of the most infamous events in crypto history. Over the past decade, a court-appointed trustee has overseen the long civil rehabilitation process. About 200,000 BTC were eventually recovered. Mt. Gox Repayments Slow Down The exchange started to repay creditors in mid-2024, after years of delay. Last month, Mt. Gox extended the creditor repayment deadline to October 31, 2026 , citing incomplete procedures. The rehabilitation trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi said that there are unresolved issues affecting numerous creditors who have not yet received their distributions. As a result, several claimants remain without compensation, prompting the court-approved extension to enable repayments “to the extent reasonably practicable.” The post Mt.

The group released a press release on Monday, stating that the State Network will attract leaders and officials to help states learn about and utilize blockchain technology. Digital Chamber to teach lawmakers about digital money Many lawmakers today lack sufficient information to make informed decisions on blockchain technology; therefore, the program will provide them with the necessary tools, knowledge, and guidance to do so. The partnership between Digital Chamber and Future Caucus will also connect lawmakers, regulators, and industry leaders, enabling states nationwide to learn from one another and develop effective policies together. The two organizations will hold workshops, training sessions, and talks in state legislatures next year to help lawmakers understand blockchain straightforwardly. The Future Caucus will utilize its Innovation Lab and extensive network of young Gen Z and millennial lawmakers to foster cooperation between states by connecting state legislators. The CEO of the Digital Chamber, Cody Carbone, stated that they aim to establish a “bench of strong leaders” who will guide their states in adopting practical and informed digital asset laws. He explained that teaching lawmakers early and providing them with the necessary tools and resources is a significant step towards creating effective crypto policies. Layla Zaidane, CEO of Future Caucus, said the partnership encourages young lawmakers to learn from one another, share experiences, and discuss what works and what doesn’t. Doing so will help them prepare to make decisions that encourage innovation while also protecting residents from risks. The State Network had already started its campaign in New York, Arizona, Ohio, and New Hampshire to introduce state leaders to digital assets, blockchain, and cryptocurrency. The Microgrants program supports local groups in teaching people about crypto Digital Chamber also announced a new Microgrants Program that will help small and emerging blockchain groups at the state and local levels to teach people about digital assets. The program will provide these small groups with the necessary resources to educate communities and lawmakers on digital assets. The Microgrants Program will accommodate state blockchain associations, university blockchain clubs, and local community innovation groups that want to educate lawmakers, students, and community members. These groups will use the funds for educational materials, building policy tools, testing new ideas, and running campaigns to inform and engage people about digital assets. The executive director of the Digital Chamber’s State Network, Anastasia Dellaccio, stated that the Microgrants Program is the company’s “first effort to grow advocacy groups” that can mobilize educational and policy initiatives in state capitals. She explained that the program focuses on building capacity, encouraging cooperation, and providing groups with a genuine opportunity to contribute to the creation of clear and fair laws. The Digital Chamber also stated that the program will connect small advocacy groups with state legislators, universities, and community organizations to form long-term partnerships that promote digital asset education. The policy has already attracted the support of prominent companies, including Michael Saylor’s Strategy , Hadera, and Input Output. These groups will collaborate with state legislators, regulators, and advocacy organizations to educate lawmakers on the opportunities and challenges presented by digital assets. They will provide the policy guidance, research support, and technical insight that the program needs to connect blockchain with policymakers for better and clever legislation.

In a move that demonstrates strong commitment to community trust, Sun has pledged full support for the USDJ redemption process during this transitional period. What Does the USDJ Redemption Mean for Investors? The USDJ redemption represents a significant development in the TRON ecosystem. Justin Sun’s announcement guarantees that every pre-snapshot holder will receive 1:1 value for their USDJ tokens. This commitment covers the entire circulating supply, including the remaining $200,000 worth of USDJ still in circulation. Moreover, the project team has already demonstrated their dedication by repurchasing over 95% of the USDJ supply throughout the past year. Importantly, these buybacks occurred at prices consistently above $1, ensuring investors received fair value throughout the process. How Does the USDJ Redemption Process Work? The redemption mechanism follows a straightforward approach that prioritizes investor protection. Here are the key details every holder should understand: Complete 1:1 value preservation for all pre-snapshot holdings Full coverage of the remaining $200,000 circulating supply Conversion support to TRX at 1.5532 TRX per USDJ Direct backing from Justin Sun and the project team This comprehensive USDJ redemption plan eliminates uncertainty for token holders. The process ensures that no investor faces financial loss during the stablecoin’s phase-out. Why Is This USDJ Redemption Important for Crypto Trust? Trust remains the foundation of any successful cryptocurrency project. Justin Sun’s personal commitment to the USDJ redemption sets a positive precedent for the entire industry. By ensuring complete protection for investors, this move reinforces the importance of responsible project management in decentralized finance. The proactive approach to the USDJ redemption demonstrates how established projects should handle asset transitions. Rather than leaving investors uncertain, the team provides clear guidance and full financial backing. What Led to the USDJ Redemption Decision? The decision to initiate the USDJ redemption follows careful consideration by the Just (JST) community. As the DAO responsible for TRON-based DeFi governance, the community determined that phasing out USDJ would better serve the ecosystem’s long-term development. The conversion ratio of 1.5532 TRX per USDJ was established to ensure fair value transfer. This strategic move allows the TRON network to consolidate resources while maintaining complete transparency with its user base. Final Thoughts on the USDJ Redemption Guarantee Justin Sun’s unwavering commitment to the USDJ redemption process showcases exceptional leadership in the cryptocurrency space. Investors can proceed with confidence knowing their assets are fully protected during this transition. This approach not only safeguards individual investments but also strengthens overall trust in the TRON ecosystem and the broader cryptocurrency market. Frequently Asked Questions Who is eligible for the USDJ redemption? All pre-snapshot holders of USDJ stablecoin qualify for the 1:1 redemption, including those holding the remaining $200,000 in circulation. What is the conversion rate for USDJ to TRX? The established conversion rate is 1.5532 TRX for each USDJ token, as determined by the Just community governance. How long will the redemption process take? While specific timelines haven’t been announced, the project team has already repurchased over 95% of the supply, indicating an efficient process. Is Justin Sun personally backing this redemption? Yes, Justin Sun has publicly committed to fully supporting the 1:1 redemption for all USDJ holders. What happens to USDJ after the redemption? USDJ is being phased out of the TRON ecosystem as part of a strategic decision by the Just community governance. Can I still buy USDJ to participate in the redemption? Only pre-snapshot holdings qualify for the redemption. Purchasing USDJ now would not guarantee eligibility for the redemption program. Found this information helpful?

This recognition highlights the bank’s leadership in implementing innovations that not only provide advanced services to clients but also make their businesses more efficient. In this article, we will explore three key areas where Alfa-Bank demonstrates its leadership: the transition to cashless depositing, the development of artificial intelligence in fintech, and the creation of non-financial services. Transition to Technological Cash Handling: Online Cash Deposit as the Future The business services market is constantly evolving, and one of the latest trends is the shift from traditional cash collection to online. This trend is easy to explain: for entrepreneurs, online cash deposit is both cost-effective and convenient, as it increases the efficiency and security of their business. Alfa-Bank offers its corporate clients an online cash deposit service that allows businesses to optimize financial processes and reduce costs. The essence of the service is that cash is deposited into a corporate account without the involvement of collectors. Bank clients can do it using ADMs (automated deposit machines), which can be installed directly on their premises – in a store, restaurant, shopping center, or any other location. Advantages of Online Cash Deposit: Time and Resource Savings: Employees no longer spend time preparing for and waiting for collectors. After installing the ADM, businesses can completely eliminate non-core functions related to handling cash, allowing employees to focus on customer service and increasing sales. Immediate Credit: With online cash deposit, there is no need to wait for the money to be brought to the bank, counted, and credited to the account. The entire amount is immediately credited to the company’s account as soon as the employee deposits it into the ADM. This allows for prompt payments to suppliers and eliminates the need for loans. Increased Security: After depositing the money, responsibility for its safekeeping is transferred to the bank. This reduces risks associated with storing cash at sales points or in the office. Flexibility and Convenience: Money can be deposited at any convenient time without being tied to the collectors’ schedule. This is particularly relevant for companies with non-standard working hours or located in hard-to-reach areas. Cost Savings: Online cash deposit allows businesses to reduce transportation costs for cash by up to 20%. In the traditional form, clients pay for each trip to deposit revenue at the bank. With online cash deposit, money accumulates in the device, which can hold up to 5,000 bills, so collectors visit less frequently. Operational Efficiency Improvement: Automation reduces human error in counting money and processing documents. The device will accept bills, count them, check their authenticity, and issue a receipt. According to bank experts, in the next two to three years, about 70% of companies will switch from traditional to online cash deposit. This is confirmed by the fact that more than 70,000 retail outlets across Russia are already using Alfa-Bank’s solutions for online cash deposit. The New Generation of ADMs Alfa-Bank was the first on the Russian market to launch the new generation of ADMs from the Moniron brand. These new devices enhance transaction security and can be adapted to specific businesses. Alfa-Bank configures the software according to the company’s request. In the near future, ADMs will feature new options, such as: Depositing cash with a single button press without entering a PIN code. The ability to choose the account for revenue crediting. The ability to use ADMs without an internet connection. These innovations make the process of receiving and crediting cash even more convenient and reliable for businesses. Development of Artificial Intelligence in Fintech In the modern world, artificial intelligence is becoming a key factor in the development of financial technologies. Alfa-Bank actively integrates AI into its products and processes, which improves customer service and enhances business efficiency. AI in E-commerce At the International Forum of Electronic Commerce and Retail ECOM&Retail Week, experts discussed e-commerce market trends. Bank analysts noted that the e-commerce turnover in Russia will grow by an average of 25% per year in the coming years. By 2028, one in three purchases in the country will be made online. One of the key trends in e-commerce is the integration of artificial intelligence. AI will be actively used by both buyers and sellers. On the one hand, buyers will receive personalized recommendations and assistants that will help them choose products and complete purchases. On the other hand, sellers will be able to automate business processes, speed up data response, and create hyper-personalized offers for clients. AI in Big Data Analysis Alfa-Bank actively uses artificial intelligence for big data analysis. This allows the bank to offer its clients non-financial services based on data analysis. Key areas of AI use in data work: Diagnosis: Clients move from simple reports with retrospective data to diagnosis, i.e., understanding the causes underlying certain results. AI helps identify specific causes and relationships within the data. Proactive Response: Clients can react instantly to data and make decisions in real-time using AI models. Hyper-Personalization: AI allows the creation of digital twins of clients and conduct hundreds of tests simultaneously, ensuring hyper-personalized offers even for individual clients. Integration with Partners Alfa-Bank actively collaborates with partners to develop technologies. For example, the bank implemented an end-to-end online order process for automated deposit machine (ADM) services through API in collaboration with an organization specializing in cash transportation. This allowed for a reduction in manual labor, faster interaction between the bank and the partner, and increased transparency of operations. Creation of Non-Financial Services Alfa-Bank is focusing on creating non-financial services that help clients solve business problems and improve the customer experience. This is particularly important in conditions where clients expect banks not only to provide traditional financial products but also additional services that simplify their lives. Payment via SBP at Self-Service Checkout Previously, Alfa-Bank and one federal grocery chain launched payment via the System for Fast Payments (SBP) at self-service checkout. Now, the customers can pay for goods without cash, quickly and securely. The payment process is simple: just scan the QR code on the screen and confirm the payment in the Alfa-Bank mobile app. This solution demonstrates the bank’s commitment to developing safe and convenient services that allow clients to make purchases without cash, using only mobile technologies. Today, the new payment method is available in more than 600 stores across the grocery chain where self-service kiosks are installed. Multi-Bank for Corporate Clients In addition, Alfa-Bank, together with other market players, launched a pilot project for a multi-bank service for corporate clients. The new service allows legal entities to view and manage data on accounts from both banks through Alfa-Business. Participants of the pilot project gain access to current balances on accounts in both Alfa-Bank and another bank. The multi-bank is built on Open Banking technology, ensuring a high level of information security and data confidentiality. The service consolidates the management of all company accounts in one window, increasing the transparency of funds movement and optimizing treasury processes. Development of Services in the Housing and Utilities Sector Alfa-Bank is implementing innovative solutions in the housing and utilities sector, which helps improve the quality of service for millions of citizens, develop modern technologies to simplify interactions between management companies and clients, as well as government agencies. Conclusion Alfa-Bank demonstrates leadership in the area of digital transformation of business, offering its clients innovative solutions that simplify their lives and increase efficiency. The transition to cashless depositing through online cash deposit, the development of artificial intelligence in fintech, and the creation of non-financial services are key areas where the bank is actively developing. Thanks to these initiatives, Alfa-Bank continues to remain at the forefront of innovations in the financial industry, providing its clients with modern and convenient solutions for running their businesses.

The decline has erased all gains made in 2025 and now sits more than 30% below its record high of over $126,000 reached in early October , with billions of dollars in unrealized losses weighing on both retail and institutional portfolios. Source: TradingView According to Bloomberg , the flow-weighted average cost basis across all ETF inflows now stands at approximately $89,600, a level Bitcoin broke through during Tuesday’s Asian trading session . While early investors who purchased between $40,000 and $70,000 remain profitable, market sentiment has deteriorated despite the influx of institutional capital. Perfect Storm of Selling Pressure Drives Historic Drawdown The sell-off has pushed Bitcoin ETFs to their second-largest drawdown since launch, with products collectively down $3.29 billion from their peak. On November 17 alone, ETF outflows reached $254.51 million, led by BlackRock’s IBIT shedding $145.57 million and significant redemptions across Grayscale’s GBTC and Ark’s ARKB. Source: SosoValue Bitcoin dominance simultaneously fell below 60% for the first time in over a month, while Ether dropped below $3,000 and major tokens, including XRP, BNB, and Solana, declined between 3% and 5.6%. Market analysts attribute the downturn to a confluence of factors that have created unprecedented selling pressure. Long-term holders who accumulated Bitcoin over the past decade are taking profits after reaching their psychological $100,000 target, while traders subscribing to the four-year cycle theory are attempting to time exits. Speaking with Cryptonews, Farzam Ehsani, Co-founder and CEO of VALR, noted that traditional market fears are driving the decline. “ The main reason for the crypto market decline is growing investor fears in traditional markets ,” Ehsani explained. “ Technology stocks, particularly those associated with artificial intelligence, have come under pressure, as investors have begun taking profits, believing current multiples are excessively high. ” Mounting concerns that the Fed may forgo interest rate cuts in December, with probability now below 50%, have further dampened risk appetite across digital assets. Strong Hands Accumulate Amid Market Panic Despite pervasive bearishness, on-chain data reveals an unusual pattern that historically precedes significant market moves. CryptoQuant analysis reveals that demand from long-term, price-insensitive holders has surged from 159,000 BTC to 345,000 BTC since October 6, marking the largest accumulation seen in recent cycles. Typically, such aggressive absorption by permanent holders triggers supply squeezes and short-term rallies; yet, this time, the price has moved sharply lower. Ki Young Ju from CryptoQuant characterized the movement as long-term holders rotating among themselves. “ This dip is just long-term holders rotating among themselves ,” Ju stated. “ Old Bitcoiners are selling to tradfi players, who will also hold for the long run. ” He noted that the market structure has fundamentally changed with ETFs, MicroStrategy, and other channels continuously injecting fresh liquidity, while sovereign funds, pension funds, and corporate treasuries are now building even larger liquidity channels. This dip is just long-term holders rotating among themselves. Old Bitcoiners are selling to tradfi players, who will also hold for the long run. The reason I predicted the top early this year is that OG whales were dumping hard. But the market structure has changed. ETFs, MSTR,… https://t.co/eGTRqPivFT — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) November 17, 2025 Plan C, a prominent market analyst, maintains that nothing has fundamentally changed for Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. “ I still see 2026 being a bull market for Bitcoin ,” Plan C wrote. “ I think this is a relatively short-lived, 1-to-3-month temporary correction similar to what we saw during the drop to $75,000 near the beginning of the year. ” He emphasized that with Bitcoin’s market cap comfortably above $1 trillion, the asset no longer carries the “ it could go to zero ” discount from previous bear markets. Critical Technical Levels Determine Near-Term Path Ehsani outlined critical technical thresholds that will determine Bitcoin’s trajectory. “ To confirm the end of the rally, the market must fall below the $92,000 zone, which will be the final signal of a break in the structure, ” he stated. “ A breakout above $105,000 is necessary to return to a confident growth pattern. ” Currently, optimistic scenarios remain plausible if macroeconomic conditions stabilize. “ If ETF demand remains strong and the macro backdrop improves, Bitcoin may return to the $111,000–$116,000 range by year-end and could target $130,000–$140,000 in Q1 2026, ” Ehsani projected. Cameron Winklevoss, Gemini co-founder, struck an optimistic note amid the turbulence , declaring “ this is the last time you’ll ever be able to buy Bitcoin below $90K. “ The post Bitcoin Slides Below $90K as ETF Investors Face First Major Losses – More Dips Ahead? appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-11-18 07:49:30

The valuation is 30% higher than the data analytics firm’s last financing round in September, where its valuation reached $100 billion. According to a report by The Information on Monday, Databricks has not signed a term sheet with any investment firm. In its previous capital raise, the firm stated that it was on track to achieve $4 billion in annualized revenue. Databricks’ AI products drive its annual revenue higher Scoop: Databricks in talks to raise at above $130B+ valuation, just months after raising above $100B. Money could be used for acquisitions to further compete with Snowflake etc. w/ @amir https://t.co/YaiMVNMhqi — Katie Roof (@Katie_Roof) November 18, 2025 The company revealed that its annualized revenue will be driven by booming demand for its artificial intelligence products. According to the announcement, Databricks planned to use the proceeds to boost its AI strategy, pursue acquisitions and research, and launch an operational database category. The data analytics firm disclosed that it plans to expand Agent Bricks and invest in its database offering Lakebase. Databricks said Agent Bricks helps build high-quality, production AI agents optimized to a user’s enterprise data, while Lakebase is an operational database (OLTP) built on open source Postgres and optimized for AI agents. “We’re seeing tremendous investor interest because of the momentum behind our AI products, which power the world’s largest businesses and AI services.” – Ali Ghodsi , Co-Founder and CEO of Databricks. Ghodsi also confirmed that every company can securely turn its enterprise data into AI apps and agents. He believes the initiative helps firms grow revenue faster, operate more efficiently, and make smarter decisions with less risk. The company announced in September that it had crossed a $4 billion revenue run rate during Q2, a 50% year-over-year growth. Databricks also said that its AI products have surpassed the $1 billion revenue run rate. Databricks’ latest capital raise comes as it reported increased growth and expansion during the first half of the year. The firm has partnered with tech giants, including Microsoft, Anthropic, Google Cloud, SAP, and Palantir. The company also acknowledged that it has more than 20,000 organizations currently relying on the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform, including Block, Comcast, Conde Nast, Shell, and Rivian. Konwinski says the U.S. is losing its dominance in AI research to China Despite the continued growth from Databricks’ AI strategy and partnerships, Andy Konwinski, the firm’s co-founder, warned that the U.S. is losing its dominance in AI research to China. He called the shift an existential threat to democracy. The co-founder of the AI research and venture capital firm Laude said many PhD students can confirm that they’ve read twice as many interesting AI ideas in the last year that were from Chinese companies than American companies. Konwinski said onstage at the Cerebral Valley AI Summit earlier last weekend that major AI giants like OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic are increasing innovation, which has remained largely proprietary rather than open source. He also believes that such companies are hiring top academic talent by offering multimillion-dollar salaries that dwarf what experts can earn in universities. Cryptopolitan previously reported that Konwinski said ideas need to be freely exchanged and discussed with the larger academic community in order to flourish. He also argued that generative AI has transitioned to a direct result of the Transformer architecture. Databricks’ co-founder believes that the first nation to make the next breakthrough in Transformer architectural level – a pivotal training technique – will have an advantage in the AI industry. Konwinski also noted that China receives massive support from the government by encouraging AI innovation. He said companies like DeepSeek and Alibaba’s Qwen are allowed to be open source, which allows others to build upon them. Konwinski acknowledged that the situation in the U.S. is different, which limits the country’s dominance in the sector. He said the trend poses not only a risk to democracy, but also a business threat to major AI labs. He also maintained that the industry needs to ensure the U.S. remains number one and open.

This expansion has continued, as Arthur (@XrpArthur), a crypto proponent on X, has shared exciting news about a new product. He shared a Cboe letter confirming approval for the listing and registration of the Amplify XRP ETF. The letter added another step in a trend that continues to build. He wrote that the filing “confirmed the approval and listing” of the Amplify ETF. His post followed two recent launches. It also arrived one day before another major firm prepared its own product. The timing increased attention on XRP as the number of regulated options continued to rise. BREAKING: A new filing from CBOE just confirmed the approval and listing of the Amplify XRP 3% Monthly Premium Income ETF under the Exchange Act of 1934. Things just got serious. pic.twitter.com/NxOOLi3fSK — Arthur (@XrpArthur) November 17, 2025 Cboe Confirms the Amplify Listing The Cboe letter addressed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) expressed its intention to approve Amplify’s XRP 3% Monthly Premium Income ETF. It gave Amplify a clear path to move forward with an ETF targeting monthly premium income through XRP-linked exposure. The product offers a regulated route for investors who want structured exposure without direct custody of XRP. The Amplify ETF uses an options strategy to seek income. The structure differs from regular spot products that focus on price tracking. This approach creates a specific role for the ETF within the growing market. It allows investors to select a product that uses defined methods rather than simple price replication. It also expands the range of available options for investors who want exposure through regulated channels.

That event marked the start of the current wave of new products. Canary Capital introduced its ETF on November 13. These launches increased the number of available entry points for institutional investors who want regulated exposure. Franklin Templeton is expected to launch its XRP ETF today . The firm has a long history in asset management. Its plan to enter the XRP market signals a rising interest. Potential Effects on XRP The rapid growth of XRP ETFs can increase demand for the asset. Regulated access helps investors who want simple entry points. It also supports stronger confidence in XRP as an investable asset. The approval of the Amplify ETF adds to this progress. Each new product strengthens visibility. The steady rise in launches may support higher institutional interest in XRP as the market expands.

Binance Futures Removes Three Futures Contracts According to the statement made by the exchange, all positions for XCNUSDT, FLMUSDT and PERPUSDT perpetual futures contracts will be automatically closed as of 12:00 on 21-11-2025, and the contracts will then be completely delisted. The exchange has issued important warnings to users to avoid any inconvenience during this process. Accordingly, investors are advised to manually close their existing positions before the delisting process begins. This will prevent potential price slippage and risks stemming from automatic liquidation. Binance also announced that new positions for these contracts will be suspended as of 11:30 AM on November 21, 2025. The delisting decision is considered one of Binance Futures' routine updates as part of its risk management and product optimization efforts. The platform periodically reviews specific contracts based on market conditions, trading volumes, and user demand. Experts believe such delistings can be triggered by factors such as low liquidity or declining demand. It's crucial for users to monitor their open positions before the last minute and complete any necessary transactions promptly.

54561166,629440,1763452849,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54561166.jpeg,Crypto Legislation Update: Market Structure Bill Slated For Urgent December Markups,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-market-structure-bill-december-markups/,"The much-anticipated crypto Market Structure Bill, designed to enhance clarity in the digital asset landscape in the United States, is reportedly preparing for markup sessions in early December. Crypto Sector Anticipates Detailed Review Before Thanksgiving In a recent report by Eleanor Terret from Crypto In America, Agriculture Committee Chair John Boozman expressed his commitment to this timeline, noting that the government shutdown had postponed his initial plans to proceed with markups earlier this week. Currently, there is an effort to have draft bills prepared within both the Senate Agriculture Committee and the Senate Banking Committee ahead of the markups. Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott, who had aimed for a Banking bill markup by the end of September, has yet to announce a date for his committee. The text related to this bill has not been released since it shifted to a bipartisan initiative following recent reconciliatory roundtables conducted on Capitol Hill. It remains uncertain whether the draft will be made public before the Thanksgiving holiday. Terret asserted that if the Banking Committee delays its release, the crypto industry will have ample material to examine over the holiday season, particularly the Senate Agriculture draft. However, notable sections in this proposal have been left blank, specifically regarding the regulation of decentralized finance (DeFi), and other legislative language remains bracketed, indicating unresolved issues among lawmakers. Year-End Pressures Digital Chamber CEO Cody Carbone remarked on the need for collaboration between the two committees, stating, “Right now it’s being done in somewhat of a siloed format.” He anticipates that the Senate Agriculture Committee will continue to gather feedback from the industry and progress in filling in the blank sections over the next few weeks. Carbone also highlighted that the Banking Committee is likely to take the initiative on DeFi regulations, which predominantly fall within its jurisdiction. This aspect of the legislation, which has garnered significant interest and will likely undergo substantial scrutiny, has not yet been disclosed. If both committees can finalize their respective drafts for markup next month, the subsequent step would involve merging these documents into a singular piece of legislation for a full Senate vote. However, the urgency of the situation is amplified by the approaching holiday season and the year-end deadlines , with expectations that the voting process and potential enactment of the market structure bill could push into next year’s session. As Carbone pointed out, “We’re running out of time, not just in the calendar year, but in this Congress.” Despite these challenges, optimism remains within the industry. Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer of crypto exchange Coinbase, recognized the importance of resolving key details but expressed confidence that the bill would ultimately progress. “I know some people fret over the details that remain to be resolved,” he stated. “But I think we’re going to get it done, even if it feels like there are still some important obstacles that remain.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Crypto News|crypto market structure|crypto market structure bill|crypto news|Cryptocurrency|US crypto|US crypto industry|US crypto news|US crypto regulation,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-18 08:00:49

The Rex Osprey XRP ETF entered the market in September, followed by Canary Capital on November 13. Both provided new on-ramps for traditional investors. Their success proves that demand exists for regulated XRP exposure in the U.S. Franklin Templeton’s entry represents a new phase. The company has a global presence and a long track record in fund management. Its decision to launch EZRP gives XRP more credibility among major financial institutions. Diana captured this sentiment, highlighting both the firm’s scale and the likelihood of significant first-day activity. Canary Capital’s ETF posted a record volume of $58 million on the first day, beating Bitwise’s Solana ETF. Diana predicted that Franklin Templeton’s ETF could match or surpass Canary Capital’s first-day record.

EZRP arrives with the weight of Franklin Templeton’s reputation in global finance. Investors expect substantial activity during its opening session. The EZRP ETF could shape how capital flows into XRP in the coming week. For token holders, it’s a clear signal that the ETF era for XRP is taking form.

At the same time, Cameron Winklevoss warned that this could be the last chance to buy the token below $90,000, putting new focus on the next move in the rally. El Salvador Adds About $100 Million in Bitcoin El Salvador bought roughly $100 million in Bitcoin during the recent market dip, according to multiple industry reports. The purchase aligns with the country’s ongoing plan to accumulate BTC as prices fluctuate. El Salvador 100 Million Bitcoin Buy. Source: Watcher.Guru Reports from independent trackers show that the government added around 1,090 BTC in recent days. The total amount places the acquisition near the $100 million mark based on current market prices. The move expands El Salvador’s national holdings , which now exceed 7,400 BTC. The buying activity surfaced after market data indicated several large transactions tied to government-linked wallets. While officials have not issued a formal statement, the reported numbers match earlier accumulation patterns promoted by President Nayib Bukele. The recent purchase comes as Bitcoin trades below recent highs, creating what some analysts described as a temporary discount window. El Salvador has previously bought into similar declines, using weakness to build long-term reserves. Winklevoss Calls Last Sub-$90K Chance as Traders Eye 2025 Setup Meanwhile, Cameron Winklevoss said on X that “this is the last time you’ll ever be able to buy Bitcoin below $90,000,” framing the current range as a final entry zone. Soon after, crypto trader Eve (@Evecoins) posted a split Bitcoin CME futures chart with his quote, linking today’s structure to the breakout phase that followed in 2020. Bitcoin 2020 2025 Futures Comparison. Source: Evecoins In the left panel, the chart tracks the 2020 futures pattern, with price compressing above a highlighted green band before breaking higher toward record levels. In the right panel, the 2025 futures curve traces a similar consolidation above another green zone, this time just below the $90,000 area. The comparison suggests that Bitcoin again sits on a thick support block that could, if it holds, act as a launchpad for a fresh leg up. At the same time, the overlay of both cycles stresses timing and positioning rather than pure hype. The 2020 side captures how long Bitcoin moved sideways before momentum finally expanded. The 2025 side now places Winklevoss’s call directly on that mirrored structure, turning the green band into the key line traders watch to judge whether his “last chance below $90,000” claim holds up or fails.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-18 08:12:33

This could soon become reality in Brazil as Federal Deputy Chrisóstomo de Moura proposes groundbreaking legislation that would allow courts to implement a cryptocurrency freeze on suspected cybercriminals’ digital assets. What Does the Cryptocurrency Freeze Bill Actually Propose? The proposed legislation represents a significant shift in how Brazil handles digital asset regulation. If passed, it would grant Brazilian courts the authority to issue cryptocurrency freeze orders on specific wallets and exercise regulatory power over cryptocurrency exchanges operating within the country. This move comes as Brazil continues to strengthen its anti-money laundering framework. The bill specifically targets individuals suspected of cybercrimes, including: Hacking and data breaches Ransomware attacks Cryptocurrency fraud schemes Digital identity theft Why is This Cryptocurrency Freeze Legislation So Important? Brazil has seen a dramatic increase in cybercrime involving digital assets. The proposed cryptocurrency freeze mechanism addresses a critical gap in the country’s legal system. Currently, law enforcement faces challenges when tracking and seizing cryptocurrency assets used in illegal activities. The legislation would provide Brazilian authorities with powerful tools to combat financial crimes in the digital age. However, it also raises important questions about privacy and due process rights for legitimate cryptocurrency users. How Would the Cryptocurrency Freeze Process Work? Understanding the proposed cryptocurrency freeze procedure is crucial for both investors and exchanges. The process would involve several key steps: Investigation phase: Law enforcement identifies suspicious wallet activity Court approval: Judges review evidence and issue freeze orders Exchange compliance: Cryptocurrency platforms must implement the cryptocurrency freeze Appeal process: Affected parties can challenge the decision This systematic approach aims to balance effective law enforcement with protection of individual rights. The cryptocurrency freeze would be temporary initially, with permanent seizure requiring additional legal proceedings. What Challenges Might This Cryptocurrency Freeze Face? Implementing an effective cryptocurrency freeze system presents several practical challenges. Technical hurdles include tracking pseudonymous wallet addresses and dealing with decentralized exchanges that may resist regulation. Moreover, the global nature of cryptocurrency markets means international cooperation will be essential. A cryptocurrency freeze in Brazil might be ineffective if assets can simply be moved to foreign exchanges. Key Takeaways for Cryptocurrency Investors This proposed cryptocurrency freeze legislation signals Brazil’s commitment to regulating the digital asset space. For legitimate investors, the bill should provide greater security and market stability. However, it also emphasizes the importance of maintaining proper records and complying with anti-money laundering requirements. The cryptocurrency freeze proposal represents a broader trend of governments worldwide seeking to balance innovation with consumer protection. As regulations evolve, transparency and compliance become increasingly important for all market participants. Frequently Asked Questions What types of crimes would trigger a cryptocurrency freeze? The legislation specifically targets cybercrimes including hacking, ransomware attacks, cryptocurrency fraud, and digital identity theft. Traditional financial crimes involving cryptocurrency may also be covered. How long can a cryptocurrency freeze last? Initial freeze orders would be temporary, typically lasting until investigations conclude. Permanent seizure requires separate legal proceedings and stronger evidence standards. Can legitimate users challenge a cryptocurrency freeze? Yes, the bill includes provisions for appeals. Affected parties can present evidence to prove their assets were obtained legally and request release of frozen funds. How would this affect international cryptocurrency exchanges? Exchanges operating in Brazil would need to comply with court orders. The legislation may also include provisions for international cooperation with foreign regulators. What safeguards prevent abuse of the cryptocurrency freeze power? The bill requires judicial oversight for all freeze orders, evidence standards must be met, and there are penalties for false or malicious reports that lead to improper freezes. When might this cryptocurrency freeze legislation take effect? The bill must pass through Brazil’s legislative process, which could take several months. If approved, implementation would likely follow a phased approach. Share this important update about Brazil’s cryptocurrency freeze legislation with your network!

Despite recent Bitcoin weakness impacting MARA's stock and Q4 outlook, current capacity and operational metrics remain robust, supporting long-term resilience. MARA is expanding into AI and HPC, leveraging its compute assets to diversify growth beyond crypto mining and tap into a trillion-dollar market opportunity. With a low valuation relative to historic levels, the recent stock pullback presents a compelling buy-the-dip opportunity for investors. It has been some time since my first article on MARA Holdings, Inc. (MARA). My cautiousness back then seems to have been justified. After recent declines, the stock is down around 17% since I initiated coverage. With Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) prices struggling lately, this should not be a major surprise. Nonetheless, the company reported earnings less than two weeks ago, and today, I'll provide an in-depth update for readers. In the analysis below, MARA's Q3 is shown to be strong both in terms of financial and operational metrics. While the price of Bitcoin may weigh on the company's Q4 results, currently capacity and efficiency are robust, and so MARA is overall well positioned to handle headwinds. Furthermore, the company has a sizeable AI opportunity in front of them as they look to expand into HPC. Therefore, I view the valuation contraction and stock price weakness as a buying opportunity right now. Seeking Alpha A Big Picture View MARA Holdings Q3 Presentation Before going into their financial results, it is worth mentioning that MARA is currently operating on four continents and has 18 digital compute sites. The reach is beyond the U.S., and as you can see in the above map, they have been able to tap renewable sources of energy, and in Finland they were also able to recycle heat to warm a population of 80K people. This is an indication that the company focuses on a stakeholder approach where they care about more than just profits, and in the long run, benefits could trickle down to shareholders. While the company is now international, you can see in the breakdown above that in terms of flexible compute, MARA is still heavily rooted in America. Later, we'll talk about their AI ambitions, and so this shows that their HPC will be mainly for the U.S. in the near future. As of now, they have 1.8 GW in flexible compute capacity, so they could potentially become a notable player. Now, onto their financial results. Revenue Performance Data by YCharts For 2025 Q3, MARA reported revenues totalling $252 million, up 92% YoY. It is quite comical that this growth rate is quite low relative to historic growth seen in late 2023 and early 2024, as over 90% growth is definitely not something to complain about. Also, note that there was top line growth acceleration in Q3, as a 64% increase was reported back in their Q2, and so it seems that overall activity is showing strong momentum. Still, MARA missed on the top line by $2.06 million, and so analysts clearly had high expectations for the company. Operating Metrics Look Robust MARA Holdings Q3 Presentation As you can see in the chart above, MARA's total Bitcoin holdings rocketed 98% YoY as a demonstration of the company's commitment to crypto despite some AI ambitions as well. In Q3 specifically, they mined a total of 2,144 Bitcoins while acquiring another 2,257. Production was up from the year ago quarter's 2,070, and the 64% YoY increase in the energized hashrate shows that their capacity has significantly improved. However, purchases were down significantly from 6,210. This significant slowing in Bitcoin acquisition could be a signal that MARA didn't see Bitcoin's price to be attractive, but they did emphasize that, unlike some other companies, they are not aiming to be a Bitcoin treasury company. They remain focussed on mining and being a digital energy company. Swinging to a Profit as Efficiency Improves MARA Holdings Q3 Presentation A key factor influencing MARA's profitability is how efficient their mining has been. Above, the daily cost per petahash is shown, and they reported that in the past 10 quarters, this metric has improved by 35%. That is a major increase in compute efficiency even as energy remains a potential bottleneck for data centers in America. For Q3, the daily cost per petahash was $31.3, down 15% YoY. That should definitely play a part in boosting the bottom line. MARA Holdings Q3 Presentation Speaking of the bottom line, as you can see on the right, MARA swung from a loss in the year ago quarter to a decent income in this year's Q3. Back in 2024 Q3, the company lost $124.8 million, and so there was quite a large YoY improvement to $123.1 million in income. This shows the healthy revenue growth rate and the improved efficiency discussed above seem to have found their way to the bottom line. In addition, while revenues missed consensus estimates, MARA beat on adjusted EPS by $0.02, and so that indicates the company operated more efficiently than expected. Bitcoin Weakness to Weigh Data by YCharts MARA's business model is still very much tied to the fortunes of Bitcoin itself. Until early this month, Bitcoin held at a relatively high level. As this month has unfolded, significant weakness has been experienced, with the cryptocurrency now back below $100K and continuing its weakness down to the mid $95Ks. While this may offer the company an opportunity to acquire some Bitcoin at a lower price, investors should be prepared for a potentially weak Q4 in terms of financial results. In fact, investors have seemingly already reacted significantly to this Bitcoin weakness, as MARA stock has seen one month losses in excess of 40% as of now. AI is an Opportunity MARA Holdings Q3 Letter As shown in the above Statista chart, the global AI market is expected to grow to $1.005 trillion by calendar year 2031. That would be a more than fourfold expansion from 2025, demonstrating the massive potential of AI. MARA clearly wants in on this major opportunity. The company stated that they ""see energy ownership as the foundation of competitive advantage in AI, just as it is in Bitcoin"" and so they are aiming to build a ""hybrid model"" where Bitcoin and AI are integrated into a single platform. Overall, I see this as a good strategic decision. The expansion into HPC will allow for more growth opportunities in the coming years, with AI demand showing no clear signs of slowing down. That said, there will be significant competition, as many companies want in on this generational shift in computing. The market will likely be large enough for MARA to be a notable player, but they are likely to need to act quickly to maximize their odds of gaining traction. Valuation is Quite Low Data by YCharts The forward P/S ratio for MARA is currently at quite a low level when compared with historic readings, and I believe that creates an opportunity for investors right now. In today's analysis, MARA has been shown to be a solid company. In terms of their mining operations, both capacity and efficiency are in strong positions. As for the growth prospects of the business, as stated above, AI creates a very real opportunity for the company in the coming years, and so investors should also look forward to that. The cause of the valuation contraction is really just the weakness in the price of Bitcoin, as there isn't much going wrong inside the company. Bitcoin prices are a temporary headwind, and as MARA puts an increasing amount of emphasis on HPC, the stock will likely become less correlated with Bitcoin over time, and investors may see that as a positive. Also note that Seeking Alpha currently gives the stock an overall valuation rating of A+ relative to the IT sector, and so the valuation does seem to be cheap. As a whole, I would consider the stock's pullback as an opportunity to get into this computing play. Final Thoughts Overall, MARA's strong operational metrics show that the company is well-positioned for the future of computing, whether that's for AI or for crypto mining. As stated above, Bitcoin prices are, of course, weighing on the stock now, but this is just a temporary headwind. Internally, MARA is as strong as ever, and AI provides a new growth driver in the years to come. The valuation is really at a quite low level right now, and so I view this as a prime buy the dip opportunity in the stock.",MARA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-18 09:10:28

While not 100% confirmed, Eric Balchunas believes the chances of a November launch are very high, based on the Grayscale’s S-1 SEC filing. The upcoming Dogecoin ETF could further boost the potential value of tokens like Maxi Doge. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has already raised over $4M in its presale, with staking rewards of 76% and a token price of $0.0002685. The surge of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is dominating the market, with major launches set to take place next week. One of the most anticipated moves is the launch of Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF, expected to hit the market on November 24, following an amended regulatory filing earlier this month. This marks an exciting new era for Dogecoin ($DOGE) as it is set to gain institutional traction and mainstream visibility. As ETFs flood the market, investors are rushing to position themselves ahead of what could be a major moment in crypto’s broader acceptance, despite Bitcoin’s recent crash below $90K. But alongside the spotlight on ETFs, a new project is also gaining significant momentum in the presale market. 🧨 Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is positioned to make a significant splash in the crypto world. With over $4M raised and staking rewards of 76%, this presale meme coin could be one of the smartest buys in the shifting crypto landscape. This growing momentum reflects the overall trend of increasing investor interest in crypto, particularly in tokens related to large-scale movements like Dogecoin. Maxi Doge is riding this wave, offering a promising opportunity to those looking to capitalize on the ongoing crypto surge. With its compelling value proposition and attractive presale offer, it stands out as one of the best crypto presales of the year. Maxi Doge: A Token Built for the Future Maxi Doge ($MAXI) isn’t just another meme coin – it plans to dethrone $DOGE as the alpha dog of all meme coins. Positioned as the next logical step in the evolution of Dogecoin-related tokens, Maxi Doge seeks to amplify $DOGE’s growing influence by bringing raw degen energy to the table and offering an enhanced staking mechanism. With staking rewards reaching an impressive 76%, Maxi Doge is attracting attention from investors seeking passive returns while benefiting from the rise of Dogecoin’s market prominence. 🧨 But it’s the coin’s meme potential that really drives it home. Maxi is everything Dogecoin didn’t dare become: unhinged, obsessed, and degenerate. Maxi promotes 1000x leverage trading and green candle buys with one goal in mind: retire by 22 and make it look easy. This focus on rewards aligns perfectly with the broader trend in the crypto market, where holders are looking for sustainable, value-driven investments. At a price point of $0.0002685 per token, Maxi Doge is a highly affordable entry point into the expanding Dogecoin-related market. With the presale now having raised over $4M, the project has shown strong early demand, which could signal its potential for growth once it enters the public market. 📖 Read our guide to buying $MAXI to learn more about the project and how to join the presale. Maxi Doge Presale: A Rare Opportunity for Investors The Maxi Doge ($MAXI) presale is one of the hottest opportunities in the market right now. The presale is fast gaining traction, and this early momentum suggests that the project will be one to watch when it officially launches. Investors who join the Maxi Doge presale now will not only benefit from attractive staking rewards but will also be positioning themselves ahead of a potential bull run in the Dogecoin market. 🧨 The upcoming launch of Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF could further catalyze the value of tokens like $MAXI, positioning it to ride the wave of Dogecoin’s growing mainstream acceptance. With Maxi Doge continuing to attract attention and funds, its presale represents a rare opportunity to get involved early in a project with significant growth potential. If you’re looking for a high-potential token that aligns with the current market trends, Maxi Doge is a presale that deserves attention. 🚀 Secure your $MAXI tokens before the next price increase.

By the closing bell, NAKA (KindlyMD’s Nasdaq-listed stock) sank to $0.55, down 25% over the past week, and a gut-wrenching 95% below where it stood six months ago. The company had until November 14 to submit its quarterly results for the three months ending September 30, but instead of delivering its usual 10-Q, KindlyMD told regulators it needed more time due to the messy accounting tied to its merger with Nakamoto, a crypto treasury firm. That merger happened earlier this year, and ever since, the financials have been chaotic. Q3 delay follows massive $59M write-down from Nakamoto deal The real bombshell? KindlyMD warned that it’s about to report a $59 million loss on the Nakamoto acquisition. That means it overpaid by $59 million compared to what Nakamoto’s assets were actually worth. Not exactly a flex. The crypto company, originally known as Nakamoto Games, became part of KindlyMD in a deal that also put David Bailey, Nakamoto’s founder, in the CEO seat back in August. Bailey hasn’t said anything directly about the company’s stock collapse or the late earnings. But he did post on X (formerly Twitter) about a leadership change at BTC Inc., the media firm he co-founded. That’s as close as he’s gotten to commenting. Still, the numbers say it all. In the same SEC filing, KindlyMD said it expects to log a $1.4 million realized loss, meaning it sold some crypto at a loss, and an additional $22 million unrealized loss on the coins it still holds. That’s not even the end of it. There’s a $14.4 million hit on extinguished debt and a whole bunch of missing confidence. To be clear, KindlyMD isn’t a giant that gets the 40-day grace period like the biggest U.S. public companies. It had 45 days, like the rest of the market. And it still missed it. Now everyone’s left guessing just how bad the quarter really was. One small piece of good news got slipped in, but it barely moved the needle. KindlyMD said it’s expecting a $21.8 million gain from a drop in contingent liabilities. Basically, one of the obligations the company owed got reduced in value. This was supposed to be the quarter where the Nakamoto merger started showing results. Instead, KindlyMD’s financials look more like a burn pile. Investors didn’t hold back: the share price cratered, and the company just painted a bright red target on its back heading into year-end. KindlyMD now faces a harsh winter.

Recent analysis confirms the crypto market sideways trend is likely to continue, leaving many investors in a wait-and-see pattern. This prolonged consolidation phase has both traders and long-term holders questioning what’s next for digital assets. What’s Driving the Current Crypto Market Sideways Trend? The cryptocurrency landscape has entered a distinct phase of price stagnation. Bitcoin has declined 16% over the past month, while major altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano have experienced even steeper drops. This pattern suggests we’re witnessing a market-wide deleveraging process that began accelerating in October. Market experts point to several factors maintaining this crypto market sideways trend. Widespread liquidations have forced many leveraged positions to unwind, creating sustained selling pressure. Meanwhile, institutional investors appear cautious about establishing new positions until clearer signals emerge. How Long Will This Crypto Consolidation Last? Rohit Apte, Market Header at Hex Trust, provides crucial context about the ongoing crypto market sideways trend. This deleveraging phase has been building since the October liquidations and shows no immediate signs of resolution. The market needs time to establish stable trading ranges that can support the next meaningful move. Key factors influencing the duration include: Institutional capital flow patterns Regulatory developments across major markets Macroeconomic conditions affecting risk assets Technical support and resistance levels being tested What Does This Mean for Bitcoin and Ethereum? The current crypto market sideways trend presents particular challenges for the two largest cryptocurrencies. According to Apte, BTC and ETH need to establish a stable range and form a clear trading channel before the market can build momentum for its next significant move. This consolidation period, while frustrating for short-term traders, actually serves an important market function. It allows excess leverage to unwind and creates healthier foundations for future growth. However, the extended nature of this crypto market sideways trend tests investor patience across all timeframes. Actionable Insights for Navigating Market Stagnation While the crypto market sideways trend continues, smart investors are adjusting their strategies. This environment rewards patience and disciplined position sizing rather than aggressive trading. Consider focusing on fundamental research during this period to identify projects with strong long-term prospects. Remember that extended consolidation phases often precede significant market moves. The current crypto market sideways trend may feel stagnant, but it’s building the foundation for the next major cycle. Use this time to strengthen your understanding of market mechanics and refine your investment approach. Frequently Asked Questions What causes a crypto market sideways trend? Sideways movement typically occurs when buying and selling pressure reaches equilibrium, often following significant price moves or during periods of market uncertainty. How long do crypto sideways trends usually last? There’s no fixed duration, but historical patterns show consolidation periods can range from several weeks to multiple months depending on market conditions. Should I invest during a sideways market? Many investors use consolidation phases to accumulate positions at stable prices, though this requires careful risk management and a long-term perspective. What signals the end of a sideways trend? Look for increasing volume breaking key support or resistance levels, significant news events, or changing market sentiment indicators. How does deleveraging affect crypto prices? Deleveraging creates selling pressure as leveraged positions are liquidated, often contributing to or extending sideways price action. Are altcoins affected differently during sideways markets? Yes, altcoins typically experience greater volatility and often decline more than Bitcoin during consolidation phases due to lower liquidity. Found this analysis helpful?

What Will They Do?",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/as-bitcoin-btc-falls-mt-gox-wallets-see-major-fluctuation-after-eight-months-what-will-they-do/,"While investors were expecting a recovery in November after the massive crash on October 11, Bitcoin (BTC)'s decline deepened and fell below the $90,000 level for the first time in seven months. While the consecutive declines in Bitcoin continue to unsettle the market, Mt. Gox wallets are buzzing with activity. Mt. Gox, once the most used Bitcoin exchange, made its first transfer in 8 months. According to Arkham data, the Mt.Gox board of trustees sent 10,608 Bitcoins worth $937 million to a new address starting with 1ANkDML, totaling 10,422.6 BTC. These addresses are believed to be cold wallets belonging to Mt.Gox, but it remains unclear whether the transaction represents an actual sale or a reorganization of internal wallets. Mt.Gox Continues to Shake the Market! Mt. Gox was once the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, handling over 70% of global BTC trading volume. However, it went bankrupt in 2014 after losing approximately 850,000 BTC. While the Mt.Gox bankruptcy remains one of the most infamous events in crypto history at this point, the company's trustees began making payments for the first time in June last year, 10 years after the bankruptcy. At this point, repayments officially began in mid-2024, but the process remains gradual and tightly controlled. The deadline for distributing remaining assets has been extended to October 31, 2026. The transferred BTC remains untouched for now, but even after 11 years, Mt. Gox continues to cast a shadow over the market and can change market perception with a single transaction. *This is not investment advice.

The country’s Ministry of Finance began marketing the offer on Tuesday, locking in investor interest just two weeks after pulling in billions from a dollar bond sale that was swarmed by demand. This time around, China is offering four-year and seven-year bonds. The initial price talk on the four-year notes has been set at about 28 basis points above mid-swap, while the seven-year tranche is targeting around 38 basis points, based on pricing guidance seen by market participants. The transaction already pulled more than €50 billion in orders by midday in Hong Kong, signaling another massive book build for Chinese debt . The offering serves multiple purposes for Beijing. It helps the government expand its sovereign euro yield curve, something it wants to deepen so that Chinese firms operating internationally can eventually reference it when issuing their own bonds. While China has been more active in the dollar market, this euro push is designed to make its funding mix more flexible, especially as global investors chase higher returns and safer names. Euro demand jumps as global buyers pile in The timing of the sale is also no accident. China just completed a $4 billion U.S. dollar bond deal that drew orders nearly 30 times its size, even though the U.S. still has a stronger credit rating and dominates the global financial system. The euro sale rides on that momentum, boosted by signs of easing trade pressure with Washington, which has helped thaw investor appetite for Chinese paper. Investors looking to diversify risk are piling into sovereign bonds. Lei Zhu, head of Asian fixed income at Fidelity, said demand is being driven by tighter spreads and higher returns. “Global investors are snapping up Chinese sovereign bonds as part of a bigger play for diversification,” Lei said . “Euro assets are in high demand thanks to strong currency gains, tighter credit spreads, and attractive returns.” That hunger for exposure in euros is critical for Beijing, since the euro bond market remains relatively shallow for Chinese issuers. By taking the lead on sovereign deals, China hopes to give its corporate borrowers a real benchmark to lean on. But while China is making noise abroad, things at home look rougher. Domestic spending collapses as budget deficit widens New data from China’s Ministry of Finance shows a huge drop in fiscal support in October, when both the general public budget and the government-managed fund fell 19% year-on-year, down to 2.37 trillion yuan, or about $334 billion. That’s the largest monthly drop since early 2021, and the lowest amount spent in a single month since July 2023. Also, in the first 10 months of 2025, government outlays climbed by only 5.2%, reaching 30.7 trillion yuan, while total revenue barely moved, inching up 0.2% to 22.1 trillion yuan. A big piece of that weakness came from land sales, which dropped 6.5% compared to the same period last year. Combined, it left the country with a budget shortfall of 8.6 trillion yuan, more than 20% higher than last year. And not all of that debt is pulling its weight. Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, said the government has been using a large share of bond proceeds just to refinance old debt instead of investing in real economic growth. “This year, a large amount of the bonds issued was used for debt replacement instead of real economic activity,” Raymond said. He warned that unless officials rework how public funds are being spent, there’s a risk that growth could stall heading into early 2026. “The Chinese government will need to review the spending pattern of the funds available,” said Raymond.

Mastercard is making this vision a reality with their groundbreaking Polygon-based remittance system that could transform how we transfer value globally. This innovative approach combines traditional financial reliability with blockchain’s speed and efficiency. What Makes Mastercard’s Polygon-Based Remittance System Special? Mastercard’s new Polygon-based remittance system represents a significant leap forward in digital payments. Instead of relying on traditional banking infrastructure, this system uses the Polygon network to process cryptocurrency transactions. The technology allows users to send funds through mobile payment apps using simple usernames rather than complex bank account numbers. The advantages of this Polygon-based remittance system are substantial. Transactions process much faster than conventional international transfers, which can take days. Moreover, the cost savings are significant since blockchain technology eliminates many intermediary fees that typically burden cross-border payments. How Does This Benefit Everyday Users? This innovative Polygon-based remittance system offers practical advantages for regular consumers. First, it simplifies the sending process dramatically. You no longer need to remember lengthy bank codes or account numbers. Instead, you can use familiar username-based transfers that work similarly to popular social media platforms. Speed : Transactions complete in minutes instead of days Cost efficiency : Lower fees compared to traditional remittance services Accessibility : Username-based transfers make sending money intuitive Security : Blockchain technology provides enhanced protection The Polygon network’s technical capabilities ensure this remittance system can handle high transaction volumes without compromising performance. This scalability means the service can grow to meet global demand while maintaining its speed advantages. What Challenges Might This System Face? Despite its promising features, this Polygon-based remittance system must overcome several hurdles. Regulatory compliance across different jurisdictions remains complex. Each country has unique financial regulations that Mastercard must navigate carefully. Additionally, user education presents another challenge since many people remain unfamiliar with cryptocurrency transactions. Market adoption represents another critical factor. While the technology is impressive, success depends on widespread acceptance by both senders and receivers. Mastercard’s established brand recognition certainly helps, but convincing traditional banking customers to embrace crypto-based transfers requires careful positioning and clear communication about benefits. Why This Matters for Financial Inclusion The potential impact of this Polygon-based remittance system extends beyond convenience. For millions of people in developing countries who rely on remittances from family members working abroad, this technology could be transformative. Lower fees mean more money reaches recipients, while faster processing provides crucial financial flexibility during emergencies. This innovation also represents a significant step toward mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. When major financial institutions like Mastercard embrace blockchain technology, it validates the entire ecosystem and encourages other companies to explore similar solutions. The Polygon-based remittance system could serve as a blueprint for future financial services integration with blockchain networks. The Future of Global Payments Looking ahead, this Polygon-based remittance system could evolve to include additional features and services. Smart contract functionality might enable conditional payments or automated recurring transfers. Integration with other blockchain services could create comprehensive financial ecosystems that transcend traditional banking limitations. The success of this initiative will likely inspire similar projects from other financial institutions. As more companies develop their own blockchain-based solutions, we may see increased standardization and interoperability between different systems, ultimately benefiting consumers through more choices and competitive pricing. Frequently Asked Questions How does the Polygon-based remittance system differ from traditional money transfers? Unlike traditional transfers that rely on banking networks, this system uses blockchain technology on the Polygon network for faster processing and lower costs, while maintaining user-friendly features like username-based transfers. Do I need cryptocurrency knowledge to use this service? No, Mastercard has designed the system to be as intuitive as conventional mobile payment apps. The blockchain technology operates in the background, so users experience familiar interfaces while benefiting from advanced capabilities. What cryptocurrencies will this system support initially? While specific details are still emerging, the system will likely support major cryptocurrencies compatible with the Polygon network, with potential for expansion based on user demand and regulatory considerations. When will this service become available to the public? Mastercard hasn’t announced specific rollout dates, but industry observers expect phased implementation beginning in regions with supportive regulatory environments and high remittance activity. How secure is this Polygon-based remittance system? The system combines Mastercard’s existing security protocols with blockchain’s inherent advantages, including encryption and decentralized verification, creating multiple layers of protection against fraud and unauthorized access. Will this service be available worldwide? Initial availability will likely focus on specific corridors with high remittance volumes, with global expansion depending on regulatory approvals and market readiness in different regions.

Most altcoins followed suit, with ETH dipping below $3,000, BNB beneath $900, and XRP toward $2.10. However, a few altcoins have defied the overall crash. BTC Kept Dropping What a painful November it has been so far. The primary cryptocurrency entered the month at around $111,000 but quickly dipped below $100,000 during the first week. It bounced off almost immediately to over $107,000 last Tuesday, but it has been all downhill since then. In the next few days, BTC was gradually sliding and dropped below $100,000 on Thursday evening. The situation worsened on Friday with another nosedive to $94,000. The weekend was calmer and slightly more positive as BTC remained in a tight range between $94,000 and $96,000. However, another leg down began on Sunday and culminated on Monday evening with a more violent drop to under $90,000. This became bitcoin’s lowest price level in roughly seven months. Although BTC has been able to recover some ground since then to the current $91,000, its market cap has dumped to just over $1.8 trillion. Its dominance over the altcoins, though, has plunged below 57%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView ICP, HYPE, ASTER Trade Differently As it typically happens when BTC heads south, so do most altcoins. ETH dipped below $3,000 yesterday, and even though it’s slightly above that line now, it’s still 5% down on the day. XRP has lost 4.5% of value, while ZEC has plunged by more than 10%. ADA, BNB, SOL, DOGE, LINK, XLM, AVAX, and HBAR are also deep in the red. Although most other lower- and mid-cap alts are in a similar or even worse state, there are a few exceptions. ICP stands out as the top gainer, having surged by more than 15% to over $5.6. HYPE has soared past $40 following a 5.5% daily jump. ASTER has gained 7.5% and now sits above $1.30.

Nonetheless, most investors are recognizing that though Ethereum still has potential, the growth is relatively modest compared to the explosive potential of the smaller DeFi projects in the marketplace. But this is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the picture. Priced at only $0.035, so far, stage 6 of the presale is over 90% sold, with over 18,050 investors on board already. Mutuum Finance is the best crypto to invest in at the moment, considering its sound roadmap, utility in DeFi, and increasing engagement with its community members. In contrast to ETH, which will require capital commensurate to one’s financial goals for any significant gain, Mutuum Finance is an opportunity for accelerated growth, as forecast estimates show the token is likely outperform well-known cryptos. Presale investors are already enjoying dramatic value growth, causing an escalated demand and looming sense of FOMO for those still on the fence. This positioning makes MUTM a top crypto for investors seeking high-upside early-stage opportunities. Ethereum Price Remains Stable, Ready for Significant Action Ethereum (ETH) is exhibiting strength amidst the volatility Bitcoin’s been experiencing, ranging within the support zone of $3,050 – $3,100 and establishing higher lows within its long-term channel at $3,175. Market participants are closely monitoring this action, as Ethereum is ranging within support and resistance, indicating intense consolidation and an upcoming breakout. If a strong break above $3,250 is achieved, this will pave the way for prices to reach $3,540 and higher, although signs of weakness in on-chain metrics and OBV decline imply buyer strength is deteriorating. On the other side, falling below support will pave the way for prices to move toward $2,850, and the upcoming bounce or break will establish Ethereum’s short-term pathway. Those investors looking for greater upside are being drawn to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as they possess explosive growth, which may outperform Ethereum on a percentage basis, yet are still in the early stages of their presales. Mutuum Finance is widely regarded as the best crypto to invest in for those seeking DeFi exposure with tangible utility. Mutuum Finance Presale Explodes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is strengthening its position. The success of the first five stages of, which surpassed over $18.8 million from over 18,000 members, have led the project to Phase 6, with over 90% of the tokens sold at the current price of $0.035, making it one of the top crypto opportunities as prices are still low. Phase 7 is on the verge of beginning, and the price of the token will go up to $0.04, setting an excellent entry point for those yet to enter and affirming the strength of MUTM as the next crypto to hit $1. Mutuum Finance Price Discovery Mutuum Finance uses a multi-layered process for price discovery, which is especially important in volatile markets where prices are subject to rapid fluctuations. Data feeds are directly linked to Loan-to-Value calculations and liquidations, and this is especially useful in the case of both over-collateralized and high-risk tokens. The above process is essential for keeping prices stable and stemming any loss of liquidity on the platform. The protocol also features dynamic collateral evaluation, meaning the evaluation is constantly updated in line with prevailing market trends. This feature enables automatic adjustment of risk factors to ensure that the system is always strong and stable, regardless of the prevailing market trends. In general, Mutuum Finance’s infrastructure is designed with accuracy, swiftness, and security, and this makes it a reliable platform for the entire lending and borrowing process. Best Crypto for Growth The presale event for Mutuum Finance’s Phase 6 has so far generated more than $18.8 million from over 18,050 investors, with over 90% of the tokens sold at $0.035. The presale event is set to enter Phase 7, which will raise the price to $0.04 and serve as the last opportunity for early investors to gain entry into the platform. Mutuum will offer security, utility, and tremendous growth potential by offering both lending and borrowing, as well as price oracles through the assistance of Chainlink, making it essential for those looking for the best crypto to invest in today. It is positioned as the top crypto for anyone seeking real DeFi adoption with high upside.

As the privacy narrative continues to run, there have been obvious winners and some that are yet to move in accordance. So, here is a list of some of the most popular privacy cryptocurrencies that could be on their way upward as investors rush to take advantage of this new narrative. ZCash (ZEC) Leads Recovery For Crypto Privacy Coins ZCash (ZEC) has moved up rapidly recently to become the foremost crypto privacy coin by market cap. The network, which is focused on providing privacy and anonymity for crypto users, saw the price of its native ZEC token rise by more than 40x in one month. ZCash (ZEC) has become one of the foremost cryptocurrencies because it provides total anonymity for crypto users . This means that transactions on the network are untraceable, and users can keep their transaction history completely secret by using ZCash. Even after rising to more than $700, expectations are that the price will continue to rally , with calls for $1,000 becoming louder on social media platforms. Currently, ZCash’s market cap is above $11 billion, putting it ahead of the likes of Litecoin (LTC). Monero (XMR) Loses Privacy Coins Lead Interestingly, Monero (XMR) is known as the OG privacy coin and was the first to go ‘mainstream’ when it comes to the crypto industry. It gradually became synonymous with hiding crypto transactions, and this drew a different kind of attention to the cryptocurrency. Governments began paying attention as rumors circulated that bad actors were using Monero (XMR) to move their illicit cryptocurrencies, earning bans from various governments. This led to the delisting of Monero (XMR) from exchanges such as Binance and Kraken. As a result of the crackdown, the Monero (XMR) price has struggled to keep up with the market. Data from CoinMarketCap puts it as the third-largest privacy coin, losing its top spot to the likes of ZCash (ZEC) and Litecoin (LTC). Litecoin (LTC) Could Be Gearing Up For A Bounce Out of the top 3 privacy coins listed on CoinMarketCap, the Litecoin price has performed the worst . In the last month, the ZEC price has risen by over 200%, Monero has rallied more than 35%, while Litecoin (LTC) has shown less than 10% gains for the same time period. Given this, it is likely that attention will turn to Litecoin next as investors jump out of the likes of ZEC with their gains. Such a movement could put the Litecoin price above $150,000 in the short term if there is a breakout with momentum.",Altcoins|crypto|crypto adoption|Crypto Market|crypto news|Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrency market|privacy coins|Privacy coins news,EN,0,0,LTC|TRADING|XMR|ZEC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-18 09:30:08

Some see it as a chart signal. Others view it as a celebration motif, hinting at an anniversary or milestone campaign. Coinbase just ignited a wave of speculation with a single date. And now traders want to know what the exchange plans to unveil on December 17. Coinbase December 17 Teaser. Source: Coinbase on X Coinbase Sparks Frenzy With Bio Update Coinbase added only two words to its X bio: “December 17.” The update appeared without context, yet it immediately pushed the crypto community into theory mode. The exchange also posted an image of a single green candle with the caption “May I meet you?”, adding fuel to expectations. Coinbase Green Candle Teaser. Source: Coinbase on X Brian Armstrong amplified the moment by telling followers to “Check Coinbase’s bio,” signaling that the date is intentional and important. His post pushed engagement even further, and the green candle image quickly became the centerpiece of speculation threads. While the exchange has not provided details, the coordinated posts suggest a planned campaign rather than a random stylistic update. Because Coinbase rarely uses its bio for teasers, the change stands out and raises questions about what happens on that date. Base Token or Something New? The biggest theory centers on Coinbase’s layer-2 network, Base. Earlier messaging from Base mentioned the team was exploring the idea of a network token, and community watchers quickly connected that earlier statement to the December 17 date. However, skeptics point out that Coinbase’s Q3 earnings call did not include any token-related plans. Because the company is public, launching a token involves significant regulatory complexity. That gap between speculation and official statements keeps the rumor unconfirmed. Still, supporters highlight Base’s record activity, integrations with Coinbase and OKX, and Coinbase’s recent push to expand its on-chain identity. These elements reinforce the idea that something Base-related could land on December 17, even if it is not a token. Marketing Event or Product Launch? Another possibility is a major product reveal unrelated to Base. Coinbase has been steadily expanding its product and app ecosystem, so a new on-chain feature or app experience remains on the table.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-18 09:32:02

For cryptocurrency investors watching forex movements, this dollar weakness creates crucial opportunities and risks that demand immediate attention. The dollar slips lower amid changing monetary policy expectations, creating ripple effects across all asset classes including digital currencies. Why is the Dollar Slipping Against Major Currencies? The recent dollar decline stems from shifting expectations about Federal Reserve policy. Several Fed officials have suggested that interest rate hikes may pause sooner than expected, causing the dollar to slip across multiple currency pairs. This dovish Fed approach signals potential relief for risk assets but concerns about economic growth. Understanding Dovish Fed Policy Impact The Federal Reserve’s recent communications indicate a more cautious approach to monetary tightening. This dovish Fed stance has immediate consequences: Reduced pressure on emerging market currencies Potential boost for risk assets including cryptocurrencies Changing capital flow patterns across global markets Key Economic Data Driving Forex Market Movements Traders are closely watching several critical economic indicators that could determine the dollar’s future direction. The forex market remains highly sensitive to these data releases: Data Point Expected Impact Release Date CPI Inflation High This Week Employment Report High Next Friday Retail Sales Medium Tomorrow How Fed Policy Shapes Currency Valuation The relationship between Federal Reserve decisions and currency values remains complex. Current Fed policy suggests continued uncertainty about the economic outlook, contributing to the dollar’s weakness. Historical patterns show that sustained dovish Fed periods typically lead to prolonged dollar depreciation. Actionable Insights for Currency Traders With the dollar slipping and key data approaching, traders should consider: Monitoring Fed speaker calendars for policy clues Setting alerts for major economic releases Diversifying across currency pairs to manage risk Watching for correlation breaks between traditional and digital assets The ongoing dollar weakness, driven by dovish Fed commentary and upcoming economic data, presents both challenges and opportunities for market participants. As the forex market digests these developments, traders must remain vigilant about shifting monetary policy expectations and their impact across all asset classes. Frequently Asked Questions What companies are most affected by dollar movements? Major multinational corporations like Apple and Microsoft face significant impacts from dollar fluctuations in their international operations. Which Federal Reserve officials have been most vocal recently? Jerome Powell and other FOMC members have provided key insights into current Fed policy thinking. How does dollar strength affect cryptocurrency markets?

The rush has created a shortage, but industry stakeholders say that’s actually what needs to happen to get this market moving. Microsoft and Google have gone on a serious buying spree over the last couple of years. Their purchases pushed prices for the good carbon credits up to almost four times what th e ch eaper forest protection ones cost. Tech firms have dropped hundreds of million s si nce 2019 on permanent carbon removal, mostly in recent years. CDR.fyi tracks this data and says total spending between spot market buys and longer-term deals hit $10 billion. Scientists say we need these carbon removal projects to slow down global warming. The y ba lance ou t em issions from industries that still burn fossil fuels, like power plants. Tech companies keep throwing up more data centers for AI, and a lot of them run on fossil fuels. So profits climb, but emissions do too . That’s what’s really pushing demand. AI boom drives carbon spending Brennan Spellacy runs a climate tech company called Patch. He says lots of businesses are using AI to grow, then taking some of that money to buy credits. “The companies that are performing well are investing heavily, and the reason why these companies are performing well is AI. So AI’s drivin g pr ofit and profit’s driving investment”, Spellacy said at the COP30 climate conference in Brazil, as mentioned in a Reuters report . The big tech names all claim they’re shooting for net-zero emissions down the road. Meanwhile, the US bailed on the 2015 Paris climate deal under President Donald Trump. A Microsoft spokesperson explained their approach: “We send strong demand signals through long-term offtakes to unlock a virtuous cycle of innovation, financing, and deployment. By anchoring large-scale projects, we both drive new supply while leaving headroom for other corporate buyers to enter.” Buyers are having a rough time getting what they want. Check out Patch’s numbers. One-third of people wanted biochar credits. But those only made up less than 20% of what actually got sold because there just weren’t enough. Forest restoration credits had the same issue. Requested 25% of the time, sold 12% of the time. Lukas May handles commercial stuff at Isometric, a carbon registry. His numbers paint a clear picture. “The desire for high quality is very real, and you can see it in the numbers. In 2024, there were 8 million tons of durable carbon removal purchased, and so far this year, it’s 25 million.” Big tech’s behind most of that jump, May says. CDR.fyi’s data show s le ss than 1 million tons of permanent carbon removal credits have been issue d in to tal. Biochar projects account for most of them. Supply’s so tight now that more companies are going for offtake agreements. May thinks that’ll help boost supply by giving developers guaranteed buyers. “At the end of the day, extra demand will drive extra supply,” he said. Some companies go DIY Pure Data Centres Group decided they’d just make their own credits. They work with big tech clients and are about to spend 24 million pounds ($31.6 million) building the UK’s biggest biochar facility in Wiltshire. CEO Dawn Childs said they didn’t have much choice. “When we started to evaluate suppliers, we quickly realised it was very difficult to find a reliable, high-quality product. We decided the best way to guarantee quality was to develop our own expertise and production.” Alastair Collier runs R&D at A Healthier Earth, the company that’ll operate the new facility. Operations start in December. They’ll scale up over 18 months to pull 9,000 tons of carbon out annually. Three more UK sites are planned. Collier’s been betting on this for years. “My underlying investment thesis has been for the last three years … that demand will, and already does, significantly outstrip supply.” This shortage is hitting while concerns about data center emissions keep growing. Some lawmakers want to slap emissions fees on facilities that go over federal limits. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The shortfall hit $41.7 billion, shattering all previous monthly records and blowing past the Reuters-surveyed forecast of $28.8 billion. The previous record was $37.8 billion in November last year, based on LSEG numbers. The biggest culprit of course is gold. Imports of the precious metal surged to $14.7 billion, nearly triple what they were a year ago, a 200% increase. Indians also went on a gold shopping spree, snatching up roughly $11 billion worth over just five days during October’s festival season, which wiped out any gains from elsewhere and helped push the overall import bill through the roof. U.S. tariffs crush exports for second month straight The other side of the trade ledger didn’t help either. Exports to the United States dropped 8.5% year-on-year in October, sliding to $6.3 billion. That marked the second straight month of decline since 50% tariffs kicked in at the end of August. Despite that slump , America still held on to its spot as India’s largest export destination, with $52 billion in shipments tallied for the first seven months of the current fiscal year. Sector-wise, it was all red. Gems and jewelry exports crashed 29.5%, bringing in just $2.3 billion. Engineering goods weren’t spared either; those fell 16.7% to $9.4 billion. Clothes, cotton, and yarn were all caught in the same spiral, each losing between 12% to 13% year-on-year. And again, the U.S. is the top buyer for all of those goods, so Washington’s tariffs are slicing deep into India’s core export base. Interestingly, exports to China rose 42% in the same month, hitting $1.6 billion. But the jump wasn’t enough to offset the pain from the U.S. collapse or the rising cost of imports overall. Festive gold spike fades, but CAD still under pressure Looking ahead, the import madness is expected to slow down, according to analysts at ICRA Research, a unit of Moody’s. They said in a note Monday that November and December should see a decline in gold shipments now that the festivals are over, and a mild recovery in exports could help rebalance things. But they also warned that the current account deficit (CAD) is about to get worse, jumping to 2.4%–2.5% of GDP in Q3 of the fiscal year ending March 2026. ICRA added that unless the U.S. pulls back those tariffs before the end of March, CAD will likely hover around 1.2% of GDP for all of FY26. And while there’s been some progress in trade talks between Washington and New Delhi, no deal has been signed yet. President Donald Trump recently suggested he might roll back tariffs on India , but nothing official has come out of it. In the meantime, India is buying more oil and gas from the U.S., and is also expected to import American farm goods, a move meant to narrow its surplus with the U.S. and show some goodwill at the negotiation table. On the gold market itself, prices dropped again Tuesday, with spot gold down 0.8% to $4,011.85 per ounce as of 0646 GMT. U.S. futures for December delivery slid 1.6% to $4,010.90. The dollar held steady after a sharp rally the day before, which made gold more expensive for other currencies. “The dollar was a bit stronger today and also some of the speculative length has been reduced this past week. The gold market is going to consolidate for now,” said Edward Meir, analyst at Marex. Gold typically rallies when rates fall, but the Fed’s Vice Chair Philip Jefferson said Monday that the central bank would need to “proceed slowly” with cuts. That poured cold water on rate-cut hopes for December. And now, with lawmakers ending the longest U.S. government shutdown , upcoming economic reports like September’s nonfarm payrolls will give more clues on where things are headed.

Price Analysis",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/11/bitcoin-btc-drops-to-89000-can-it-still-recover-from-here-price-analysis,"Bitcoin (BTC) dropped as low as $89,270 early on Tuesday. The last major horizontal level and the last major trendline have been breached. Bitcoin is now rapidly descending into a bear market … or is it? The writing is on the wall for a bear market … isn’t it? It’s said about bear markets, and especially those pertaining to Bitcoin, that when price first descends into the bear market there is a strong sense of disbelief. This was certainly the case in November 2021. The price had just made a higher high after a huge correction, and with everyone waiting for a blow-off top that never came, the price just quietly sank into a ruinous bear market. It could be the case now that a similar sentiment pervades the market. All the signs of a beginning bear market are there. The price has broken down through key supports which have heralded previous bear markets, and yet there are those who still believe that a recovery is possible. A recovery needs to start now Source: TradingView So here we are, in the short-term time frame, below a major trendline which began in mid-October 2023, and that has held through most of the bull market till now. If there is to be any faint hope of a recovery it needs to start now. The main positive is that the $BTC price is heavily oversold. Price does not keep going down, it is like the tide going in and out, and it looks like after a good period of the tide going out, it is about to come in again. It just remains to be seen how quickly and strongly that can be. If the bulls are only able to take the price back to the major trendline and the upturn weakens there, this would likely just be a confirmation of the breakdown, and it would be ‘bear market here we come’. In addition, if the bulls are able to get back above the horizontal support level they would be faced with strong resistance, not only from the major trendline, but also from horizontal resistance, plus the minor downtrend lines. If the bulls can surmount all of this, they will have deserved this last opportunity to save the day and force a continuation of the bull market. Descending channel continues to play a role Source: TradingView The daily chart for the $BTC price brings the descending channel back into focus. This channel is continuing to play a major role in the fortunes of $BTC, and right now, it can be seen that should the bulls succeed in bringing the price back above the horizontal support, this would include the bottom trendline of the channel. From here, the serious assault on the major trendline could begin. The bottom of the chart shows the indicator line in the RSI descending into oversold territory. Some kind of a bounce should be incoming. Can bulls clutch the last straw? Source: TradingView In the weekly chart the bears can be clearly seen to be winning as things stand. The $BTC price is below the 0.618 Fibonacci, the major trendline, and the bottom trendline of the descending channel. To make things even worse, the 44.00 level in the RSI has been breached. This would normally signal a descent into a bear market. Is there any straw that the bulls can still grab hold of in order to extricate themselves? It’s quite simple really. By the end of the week the price needs to be back above the major trendline, and that should put it back above the 0.618 Fibonacci, which is another major horizontal level. What are the chances of this happening? Bitcoin is very oversold, and all the momentum indicators have reset. However, liquidity drying up is what has caused this dump in the first place, so can it be replaced quickly enough? That remains to be seen.

Major companies like Coinbase, Nvidia, and Block are driving real-world blockchain adoption. Tokenization, stablecoins, and onchain settlement are transforming capital markets heading into 2026. What is Blockchain and Why Is It Important for Crypto? Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability without the need for a central authority. Each “block” in the chain contains a set of verified transactions, and once added, it cannot be altered—creating a trustworthy, tamper-resistant record. This technology is the foundation of all cryptocurrencies, enabling peer-to-peer transfer of value, smart contracts, and decentralized applications. By removing intermediaries and reducing the risk of fraud, blockchain has become essential to the growth and credibility of the crypto economy. The onchain economy is rapidly evolving as blockchain technology continues to mature and integrate into mainstream finance. Against this backdrop, a growing ecosystem of companies and investment instruments is driving this transformation, building the infrastructure that supports digital assets, expanding access to tokenized markets, and creating new avenues for exposure to blockchain-based innovation. These leaders are not only shaping the future of decentralized finance but also redefining how value is created, exchanged, and secured across the global economy. The Top Blockchain Companies to Watch The onchain economy spans multiple sectors, each playing a distinct role in supporting, expanding, and innovating within the blockchain ecosystem. From digital asset exchanges that facilitate trading, to miners powering the network, to fintech firms bridging traditional and decentralized finance, these companies represent the most significant players shaping the future of digital value creation. Below is a breakdown of key leaders across core categories driving blockchain adoption and infrastructure as we head into 2026. Exchanges Coinbase Global Inc. ( COIN ) (2.58% of NODE assets) The largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase serves as the gateway for millions of investors to access, trade, and custody digital assets. Its institutional offerings and regulatory leadership continue to make it a cornerstone of the crypto economy. Robinhood Markets Inc ( HOOD ) (2.24% of NODE assets) Known for democratizing stock trading, Robinhood has expanded into crypto, offering easy access to digital assets for retail investors. Its integration of traditional equities and crypto under one platform helps blur the lines between legacy finance and the blockchain world. Mining Core Scientific Inc. ( CORZ ) (3.93% of NODE Assets) One of the largest Bitcoin miners in North America, Core Scientific is evolving beyond crypto mining by transforming its infrastructure to support AI and high-performance computing workloads—bridging two of the fastest-growing digital frontiers. Cipher Mining INC. ( CIFR ) (6.42% of NODE Assets) & Bitfarms Ltd/Canada ( BITF ) (1.10% of NODE Assets) Both companies have delivered standout performance recently. They exemplify the resurgence of the mining sector as Bitcoin’s price and network activity strengthen. TradFi Enablers & FinTech MercadoLibre Inc. ( MELI ) (1.07% of NODE Assets) Often called the “Amazon of Latin America,” MercadoLibre has become a fintech powerhouse, integrating digital payments and crypto services into its e-commerce ecosystem, accelerating financial inclusion across the region. Asset Managers & “HODLers” Strategy Inc. ( MSTR ) (0.24% of NODE Assets) The largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy has transformed from a software firm into a de facto Bitcoin investment vehicle, with a treasury strategy that underscores its conviction in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Galaxy Digital Inc ( GLXY ) (4.35% of NODE Holdings) A diversified digital asset financial services firm, Galaxy operates across trading, asset management, and investment banking for the crypto economy, positioning itself as a key institutional gateway into blockchain markets. Energy Infrastructure Kinder Morgan Inc. ( KMI ) (0.54% of NODE Assets) A major natural gas provider in the U.S., Kinder Morgan plays an indirect but essential role in the crypto economy by powering the data centers and mining operations that sustain blockchain networks. What Are Some Real-World Use Cases of Blockchain in 2025? Blockchain is often framed as a backend technology - but in 2025, it’s driving real, visible change in how money moves, how capital markets work, and how institutions manage liquidity. The story now revolves around tokenization, programmable settlement, and embedding yield-bearing assets onchain. For example, picture a global merchant paying suppliers in dozens of countries, but no longer relying on SWIFT and banks. Stripe’s rollout of USDC payments in 50+ countries lets businesses settle instantaneously in stablecoins, eliminating delays and heavy foreign exchange costs. Beyond payments, stablecoins now collateralize and fund onchain lending at scale; Visa’s analysis shows monthly borrowing hit fresh highs in 2025, underscoring stablecoins’ role as working capital in DeFi money markets. Meanwhile, big banks are also rethinking the plumbing of finance. JPMorgan’s Kinexys platform lets institutions post tokenized securities as collateral and move them across venues without traditional settlement friction. These examples hint at broader shifts: capital markets are becoming more modular, liquidity is more dynamic, and assets are gaining a programmable layer. In this new world, blockchain isn’t experimental—it’s becoming foundational. Check out VanEck’s Onchain Economy ETF ( NODE ) for more insights.

""Is the Bottom Near?""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-bottom-report-from-bitfinex-is-the-bottom-near/,"Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) fell to a seven-month low on Monday, extending a weeks-long correction as confidence in the cryptocurrency market continues to deteriorate. At this point, Bitcoin has fallen below $90,000, down 5.8% in the last 24 hours. BTC has erased all of its gains from 2025 and is down nearly 27% from its all-time high just over a month ago. However, as Bitcoin's losses continue to mount, some analysts say the possibility of a near-term bottom is increasing. At this point, Bitfinex analysts analyzed that this correction is the third largest since 2023, but the recent increase in Bitcoin's realized losses has slowed and the market is approaching a short-term bottom. Analysts pointed to a possible bottom, noting that the current pace of selling and the magnitude of realized losses experienced by investors are beginning to stabilize. Bitfinex analysts said this data suggests the market may be entering a consolidation phase rather than a prolonged capitulation and is approaching a bottom. “Historically, sustainable lows have only occurred after short-term investors gave up. Based on current flows, the market appears to be approaching this threshold once again. At this point, the short-term recovery and bottom will depend on whether short-term investors capitulate and the remaining selling pressure dissipates.” Apart from Bitfinex, senior analyst James van Stratten also said that the correction met the conditions for a structural bottom. “CME Bitcoin futures opened at $93,840, leaving an unfilled gap in the $91,970 region. If the price tests this gap and supply and demand stabilize, conditions for a recovery could be created.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Bitcoin ""Bottom"" Report from Bitfinex!

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi crypto that brings extraordinary DeFi functionality and a dual lending system that provides both Peer to Peer and Peer to Contract lending and borrowing, is a leading cryptocurrency being considered for investment. Mutuum Finance is already in phase 6 of its presale stage and has sold over 90% of its tokens, implying that the time to buy MUTM is running out very quickly. Available at a remarkably low price of $0.035, MUTM provides a tremendous opportunity to invest in a cutting-edge DeFi platform that could yield enormous profits even while Bitcoin continues to consolidate. Bitcoin (BTC) Dips Below $100K as Whale’s Market Exit BTC has been observed to be sharply declining, having lost 2.93% over the past day and currently trading at $98,842. The key $100K handle has been parted ways with. The risk-off sell-off driven by the Nasdaq’s decline of 2.3%, lower odds of a December rate cut, and a direct technical sell-off driven by the RSI dipping into oversold levels is the key trigger for the decline. With the bearish pressures intact, a move to $85,000 doesn’t look very unlikely. Market participants are already aligning with the notion of identifying the very best crypto to buy through sound fundamentals and early adoption metrics, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is gaining traction in the DeFi sector. MUTM Shines in Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently generating a buzz within the market because the presale event of the DeFi crypto is approaching the end of Phase 6. The token currently sells at $0.035, which is a hike of 250% since the token launch at $0.01 during Phase 1. Phase 6 has already crossed the 90% mark with over 18,050 individuals having contributed over $18.8 million into the project, representing the level of confidence that the marketplace has put into the project. As the presale event enters Phase 7, the token is anticipated to rise towards $0.04, nearing the listing of $0.06 within the crypto marketplace. This gradual price increase has made MUTM a top crypto to buy this month. Card Purchases Mutuum Finance has also made a significant breakthrough towards ensuring that the platform becomes accessible and inclusive through the ability to buy MUTM tokens using credit and debit card payments. This will enable various individuals across the world to buy the tokens, thus accessing the DeFi platform effortlessly. With the elimination of the usual hurdles for participation, the upgraded system delivers a seamless and convenient experience for both seasoned crypto traders and new entrants into the field. This convenience not only improves adoption across the international community but also solidifies MUTM’s position within the list of top cryptos to buy. The confidence level within the MUTM is also enhanced through the robust security standards that are incorporated into the protocol. The project has scored a grade of 90 out of 100 in the CertiK Token Scan with respect to security, which places the project amongst the most secure projects within the field of decentralized finance. Moreover, a $50,000 bug bounty program has also been incorporated into the project with the aim of persuading white-hat hackers to look for loopholes within the project before its deployment onto the main network. V1 Protocol Launch in Q4 The launch of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) V1 protocol is a major milestone for the project, scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2025 within the Sepolia testnet. This is the first time the lending feature of the Mutuum Finance platform will be launched, allowing the community to lend two of the leading cryptocurrencies, namely ETH and USDT. The community gets the opportunity to utilize the Mutuum Finance protocol during the testnet period and thus provide feedback that will improve the functioning of the protocol. Other cryptocurrencies will be supported when the protocol is completely launched. As Bitcoin fluctuates, pulling the entire traditional market along with it, MUTM exemplifies the power of resistance as a top crypto to buy. The DeFi crypto is currently underway with its 6th presale round, during which 90% of the allocated tokens have already been sold. The upcoming Phase 7 presale will see a 20% token hike, making now the best moment to invest.

Traders watched nervously as the flagship token moved around $90,700, leaving it roughly 25% beneath its recent all-time high of just over $126,000 reached on Oct. 6. Markets noted that a big liquidation event on Oct. 10 still echoes through trading desks. Related Reading: From Dotcom To Crypto: Veteran Analyst Says The Bull Run Isn’t Over Analysts See A Near-Term Bottom According to an interview on CNBC, BitMine chairman Tom Lee said the Oct. 10 liquidations and ongoing uncertainty about whether the US Federal Reserve will cut rates in December have kept pressure on crypto. He described signs of exhaustion among sellers and cited technical work suggesting a bottom could appear soon. Tom Lee and Matt Hougan both say crypto prices are getting close to forming a bottom. Source: YouTube Bitwise Asset Management chief investment officer Matt Hougan shared a similar line of thinking, calling current pricing a “generational opportunity” and urging longer-term investors to take notice. He added that traders are jittery about the economy, high AI valuations, and US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which may have added to selling. Selling Fueled Mostly By Short-Term Holders According To XWIN Research, a review of on-chain measures showed short-term holders did much of the heavy lifting in the recent decline. The Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio fell below 1 on multiple occasions, which signals many short-term owners sold at a loss. XWIN also said coins younger than three months made up most of the spent volume during the worst of the drop. That pattern points to panic-driven exits by recent buyers rather than mass, late-cycle distribution by longtime holders. At the same time, metrics such as Coin Days Destroyed, Realized Profit, and Long-Term Holder Net Position Change registered increased distribution by long-term holders since September, but XWIN argued this behavior matches routine profit-taking during a bull run rather than blow-off top selling. Flow From ETFs And Whales Adds Pressure Reports have disclosed that exchange-traded fund outflows and large sales by whales also contributed to the weakness, while rising geopolitical tensions added a further layer of risk. Market participants described Bitcoin as an early mover that started to weaken before other risk assets, which some investors took as a warning signal for broader markets. Related Reading: Crypto Carnage Continues — Tom Lee Exposes What’s Really Going On Outlook Hinges On Stocks And Policy Lee expects a rebound if equities rally later this year, saying a stronger stock market would likely lift Bitcoin back to fresh highs before year-end. Hougan agreed that a recovery could come quickly and that the current window offers an attractive entry for investors planning to hold for 12 months or more. Yet traders remain split; a few see the recent data as clear exhaustion, while others warn macro events and policy decisions could push prices lower before confidence returns.

Best Meme Coins in 2025: Navigating Bitcoin’s Volatility with a New Opportu November 18, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bitcoin’s recent plunge below $90,000 has shaken the market, erasing its 2025 gains and stirring ‘extreme fear’ among investors. This sharp decline, driven by a ‘death cross’ and stalled ETF inflows, has left many wondering about the future of cryptocurrencies. With Bitcoin facing significant resistance and market sentiment at its lowest since 2022, top altcoins like Ether and Solana have followed suit in losses.

The Canadian-based miner achieved this milestone despite reporting a $15.8 million net loss attributed to accelerated equipment depreciation from its rapid Paraguay buildout. The company’s explosive growth resulted from the successful execution of its dual-engine strategy, combining scaled Bitcoin operations with its BUZZ HPC division. With operational hashrate reaching 25 exahashes per second by November 2025, HIVE now targets annualized Bitcoin mining revenue of approximately $400 million. Driven by the rapid scale-out of our Bitcoin mining fleet (with 25 EH/s operational today) and accelerating demand for @BUZZHPC services, this quarter marks the strongest dual-engine growth in HIVE’s history. pic.twitter.com/M9M9c77fxf — HIVE Digital Technologies (@HIVEDigitalTech) November 17, 2025 HIVE’s Bitcoin Production Soars HIVE’s Bitcoin mining revenue more than doubled to $82.1 million during the quarter ending September 30, representing a 101% sequential increase fueled by an 86% jump in average hashrate to 16.2 EH/s. The company successfully mined 717 Bitcoin despite facing a 21% quarter-over-quarter increase in network difficulty and intensified competition across the industry. The revenue surge came as Bitcoin traded near elevated levels during the quarter. However, the crypto has since retreated from its October peak of above $126,000, dipping briefly below $90,000 earlier today . Bitcoin falls below $90,000, marking the first time spot ETF investors face collective losses since they launched. #Bitcoin #ETFs https://t.co/pGVAZ41La2 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 18, 2025 Despite this volatility, HIVE maintained gross operating margins of 49% after direct costs of $42.1 million, with roughly 88% of those expenses representing energy costs at competitively priced rates below two cents per kilowatt-hour in Sweden. Executive Chairman Frank Holmes emphasized the significance of the results, stating that despite Bitcoin hashprice increasing only about 25% year-over-year, revenue soared 285% “ due to our aggressive hashrate expansion and relentless focus on efficiency .” The company generated $132.9 million in revenue during the six months ending September 30 while maintaining a debt-free balance sheet. Rapid Infrastructure Expansion Positions HIVE for AI Growth HIVE completed a 300-megawatt capacity buildout in Paraguay within six months, bringing its global hydro-powered data center footprint to 540 MW with a pathway toward 400 MW in Paraguay. The company is converting its 70 MW Grand Falls campus in New Brunswick into a Tier III+ liquid-cooled facility capable of supporting approximately 25,000 next-generation GPUs, while similar retrofits advance at Toronto and Boden facilities. The BUZZ HPC segment posted record revenue of $5.2 million, up 175% year-over-year, with management targeting approximately $140 million in annualized revenue by Q4 2026 at roughly 80% gross margins. President and CEO Aydin Kilic noted the company now runs “ a Bitcoin mining revenue run-rate approaching $400 million at a 50% operating margin after electrical costs. “ Notably, shares in HIVE Digital climbed 7.55% on Monday following the announcement of its earnings. Source: Google Finance Mining Sector Faces Profitability Crisis as Rivals Pivot to AI HIVE’s strategic positioning comes as the broader mining sector faces severe pressure. According to TheMinerMag , Bitcoin hashprice plunges to 14-month lows near $39 per petahash per second amid sustained network competition above 1 zettahash. Bitcoin Mining stocks have also shed more than $20 billion in market value since mid-October, erasing gains from their year-end rally as Bitcoin’s seven-day moving average hashrate hovers near 1.1 ZH/s despite profitability approaching levels that challenge even the newest fleets. Source: Miner Mag The deteriorating economics has triggered a wave of strategic pivots across the industry. Bitfarms announced recently that it will completely wind down its Bitcoin mining operations in 2026 and 2027, following a $46 million Q3 loss, making it the first major public miner to abandon crypto mining entirely for AI infrastructure. Other miners have similarly embraced AI diversification while maintaining Bitcoin operations. TeraWulf posted an 87% revenue surge to $50.6 million in Q3 , offsetting lower Bitcoin production of 377 BTC with higher average prices and growing HPC lease income. The company secured multibillion-dollar deals with Fluidstack and Google for AI infrastructure hosting at its Lake Mariner site, while IREN signed a $9.7 billion agreement with Microsoft for GPU-based AI services.

This marks the first time since these investment products launched that the typical holder faces losses. The flow-weighted cost basis across all U.S. Bitcoin ETFs now stands at nearly $89,600. Bitcoin dropped below this threshold on Tuesday, according to Glassnode analyst Sean Rose. The cryptocurrency traded at $91,261 at the time of reporting. Some early investors who bought Bitcoin between $40,000 and $70,000 remain profitable despite the recent downturn. BTC 24-hour price action, Source: CoinMarketCap Long-Term Holders Show Resilience Vincent Liu, Chief Investment Officer at Kronos Research, provided insight into investor behavior under current market conditions. He noted that most ETF holders maintain long-term positions. Being underwater does not typically trigger immediate selling pressure from this cohort. Liu emphasized that broader market factors drive current price action. Liquidity conditions and macroeconomic signals determine whether losses translate into sustained downward pressure. Tight financial conditions can amplify selling. Clear signals of monetary easing could provide relief. The outflow trend began on November 12 when Bitcoin ETFs recorded $278.1 million in withdrawals. The situation worsened on November 13 with $866.7 million exiting the products. This represented the second-worst trading session on record for Bitcoin ETFs. Outflows continued on November 14 with $492.1 million in redemptions. Major ETF Products Record Substantial Withdrawals Monday's trading session extended the bleeding to five consecutive days. Combined outflows reached $254.6 million across all US spot Bitcoin ETFs, according to Farside Investors data . BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust recorded the largest single-day withdrawal. The fund saw $145.6 million exit on Monday alone. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund posted $12 million in outflows. ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF lost $29.7 million. The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF shed $9.5 million. Ethereum ETFs faced similar pressure. Spot Ether ETFs recorded combined outflows of $182.7 million on Monday. BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust ETF suffered the heaviest impact. The fund witnessed $193 million in single-session withdrawals. The market's risk-off sentiment reflects broader concerns about monetary policy and economic conditions. Investors await clearer signals from central banks regarding future interest rate decisions. Solana ETFs continued their remarkable performance streak amid the broader crypto market selloff. The products posted another day of positive inflows on Monday. The Bitwise Solana Staking ETF attracted $7.3 million in new investment. The Grayscale Solana Trust ETF added $0.9 million. These funds have recorded inflows every trading day since launching in late October. Cumulative net inflows across the three Solana ETFs now total approximately $390 million.

The onboarding process can also be guided, which is helpful for beginners. There are multiple advanced settings that you will have to configure, but the process is straightforward. Creating an account First things first, creating an account with CoinTracker is very easy. You can use your Google profile, your Coinbase account, or your Apple ID. Of course, you can register with a standalone email address as well. Once you open your account, the platform will guide you through a simple setup. This includes some basic questions such as your country of residence, as well as prompts to import your very first exchange. You can skip all of these and come back to them later if you want. If you do, however, CoinTracker will automatically set it up and present you with a dashboard, which already tracks your portfolio, based on the information you’ve imported. If you don’t, you will be presented with a simple screen like this one: Advanced settings Once you have your account all set up, I highly recommend that you take a look at the advanced tax settings. Go to Account (bottom left) -> Settings -> Tax. This is the screen that you should see: You should verify these based on your current tax jurisdiction and select the right choice. Note that CoinTracker supports the most popular cost-basis calculation methods – FIFO, LIFO, and HIFO. Interface, dashboards, accessibility CoinTracker’s interface is very intuitive. In the left sidebar, you will find everything you need to monitor your portfolio. If you navigate to Account health, you will also see some of the issues that CoinTracker monitors and alerts you for, such as: Exchange issues Ignored exchange issues Potential spam Resolved spam Once you have all of your exchanges and wallets imported, here’s how an example dashboard overview looks like (image courtesy of CoinTracker): Importing wallets, exchange APIs, and more Importing your wallets and exchanges to CoinTracker is very straightforward. On the top right of your homepage, you will find the “Add Wallet” button, and as soon as you click it, you will see the supported platforms. You have multiple options to import. These include: For Web3 wallets, you can connect it through a CSV import or just paste your address. For exchanges, you can import your CSV or paste your API key. Supported platforms CoinTracker supports a broad range of exchanges and Web3 wallets. As mentioned above, importing them is very easy. Supported exchanges: Binance Coinbase Kraken KuCoin, and more. Supported wallets: Coinbase wallet MetaMask Phantom Ledger Trezor, and more Core Features & Integrations Quick summary: CoinTracker supports more than 500 exchanges, wallets, and blockchains. It imports data automatically, calculates cost basis and gains, and is capable of generating tax-ready forms. It can provide real-time portfolio alerts and insights, while also supporting advanced tax strategies like tax-loss harvesting. Core Features Automates Exchange & Wallet Imports Right off the bat, CoinTracker allows you to import more than 500 exchanges, wallets, and blockchains. If the automated import or the API syncing fails, you will be able to upload a CSV. Once you are connected, your full transaction history, which includes trades, transfers, staking income and other wallet-related movements, will be pulled in a unified ledger. This particular automation reduces manual entry greatly and it helps you ensure that you don’t overlook any potential taxable events. For all of the major exchanges, CoinTracker does a really good job in automating the imports. However, some of the lesser-known platforms and more obscure blockchains might still require manual uploads and review. Who it’s best for: Investors across multiple exchanges or wallets seeking automation when filing crypto taxes . Pros: Extensive exchange and wallet support. Minimal manual data entry for major exchanges and Web3 wallets. Unified ledger of all transactions. Cons: Less seamless for obscure exchanges and blockchain networks. Occasional manual CSV upload may be required. Generates Tax Forms & Calculates Cost-Basis CoinTracker will automatically calculate your cost-basis and your gain/loss using your connected transaction history. In other words, it aggregates all the data and does the calculations on all of it at the same time. The crypto tax tool will also automatically produce tax-ready documents, which include IRS Form 8949 and Schedule D for the US-based users. This particular feature is central to its value – it converts raw transaction information into a format that aligns with official tax reporting requirements. It can save you hundreds of hours of manual work. More importantly, it makes sure that the information is presented in a compliant manner and that there are no mistakes when classifying taxable events. However, keep in mind that if you’re engaging in very complex DeFi transactions and activities, it is highly recommended that you take a second look at the results and verify that they are correct. Who it’s best for: Traders and investors who need very accurate tax documentation and minimal manual labor. Pros: Automatically creates tax-form-ready documents. Supports multiple cost-basis methods. Streamlines the overall tax filing process. Cons: Complex DeFi flows and transactions may require manual review. Fewer non-US jurisdiction forms are supported. Tax-Loss Harvesting Features If you’ve read our article on the best ways to reduce your crypto taxes , you already know that using tax-loss harvesting is high up on that list. If you haven’t, well, I strongly suggest you do that right now! Beyond basic import and reporting, CoinTracker can also identify tax-loss harvesting opportunities. It can break down tax lots, and thereby potentially reduce your tax liability. This is something that makes it more than just a regular bookkeeping tool – it also offers strategic value. For example, the software is capable of flagging assets that show unrealized losses, which may offset realized gains when you sell. This is a very strong feature for proactive investors, but in many cases it’s shielded behind a high-tier paywall, so full access usually comes with increased pricing. Who it’s best for: Active traders who want to optimize their tax outcomes. Pros: Highlights tax-loss harvesting opportunities. Helps you optimize tax lots and tax reduction strategies. Adds value beyond basic bookkeeping capabilities. Cons: Requires accurate and complete transaction history. Feature is locked behind a more expensive plan. Tracks Portfolio in Real-Time If you’re like me, you like seeing all of your assets in one place. CoinTracker gives you a live dashboard, which shows your crypto holdings, asset allocation, as well as the realized and unrealized gains/losses over time. This allows you to quickly and easily monitor your entire crypto portfolio all within a unified dashboard. This is helpful, because you can understand not just the tax implications, but also your overall portfolio health and make better financial decisions. The view is very clear and updated and you don’t have to switch between exchanges. Of course, its accuracy is strictly based on the information you’ve imported, so missing transactions can easily distort the broader overview. Who it’s best for: Investors who need visibility into their investment performance and tax exposure. Pros: Unified portfolio monitoring dashboard. Real-time tracking of gain/loss. Improves decision-making. Cons: Requires thorough data import. Deeper analytics still limited. Security & Compliance Infrastructure Undoubtedly, security is a primary concern when you are connecting your APIs to financial and crypto platforms. CoinTracker is using read-only API integrations, as well as end-to-end encryption, token-based two-factor authentication, and also supports many smart contracts and dApps to reflect its coverage. This means you can trust it to handle your transaction data securely. Of course, while this level of security offers certain peace of mind, I highly encourage you to verify wallet permissions and to keep your personal credentials secure. Who it’s best for: Users who want to prioritize data protection and want audit-ready compliance for their crypto tax workflow. Pros: Read-only API access to protect user funds. End-to-end encryption and 2FA. Broad support for smart contracts and dApps. Cons: It would require the proper setup of security features. You would still have to review tax logic manually, at least at the beginning. Integrations CoinTracker integrates with QuickBooks and Xero. This means you can sync your crypto transactions directly into these accounting ledgers. The integrations can further streamline your tax workflow, especially if you are an accountant or a crypto-oriented business by aligning crypto activities with fiat bookkeeping systems. Moreover, CoinTracker also offers automatic exports to tax-filing platforms such as TurboTax and H&R Block Tax Software. This enables compliant crypto-tax reports that are ready for whoever is handling your taxes. Who it’s best for: Accountants, tax professionals, crypto-oriented businesses, and firms with substantial activities in the industry. Pros: Seamless integration with QuickBooks and Xero. Can export directly to TurboTax and H&R Block. Aligns the crypto transaction activity with fiat accounting systems. Supports multi-client or enterprise workflows. Cons: Some of the advanced integrations require a subscription to paid plans. Configuration might be a bit tricky for beginners. Pricing Plans Quick summary: CoinTracker offers a free tier for those who are interested in mostly monitoring features. The paid plans start at around $59 per tax year and scale up to high-volume tiers and enterprise solutions. Higher tiers unlock more features and a higher transaction count. Free Plan Cost: $0 Includes: Unlimited imports (tax-form downloads require an upgrade), portfolio tracking, import of exchange/wallets, live dashboard, and basic tax summary. Best for: Beginners or casual users looking to test the platform, or who want to consolidate their portfolio overview in a single dashboard. Base Plan Cost: $59/year Includes: Up to 100 transactions, all Free features + downloadable tax forms, support for tax-software export, some staking-limit exclusions. Best for: Intermediate crypto users who have moderate trade volume and are not active traders. Pro Plan Cost: $199/year Includes: Up to 1,000 transactions, all Base Plan features + tax-loss harvesting, performance and portfolio analytics, priority support.

Full Service Plan Cost: $3499/year Includes: You pretty much get a dedicated account manager who handles everything for you. Best for: Very high-volume traders, institutions, accounting firms, or users with very large portfolios and transaction count. Performance, Reliability & Support Quick summary: CoinTracker delivers strong performance and reliability for the majority of crypto users looking for tax assistance. This is especially true for those of you who use mainstream exchanges and standard Web3 wallets. Its support infrastructure is also very solid and ranked highly by thousands of users. Performance CoinTracker’s system, in general, is developed to process a large volume of crypto transactions in an efficient way. It supports more than 500 different exchanges, Web3 wallets, and blockchain networks, providing automatic classification of transaction types and generates reports. Syncing data from major exchange venues like Coinbase, Binance, and others, will most likely go smoothly for you – as it did for me and many others. Portfolio tracking updates are also very fast. At the same time, if you try to connect lesser-known apps, chances are that you will have to do some manual work. But it’s important to note that this is common for the majority of the best crypto tax software solutions . Reliability In my experience, CoinTracker was performing reliably, and this seems to be the shared consensus. The real-time portfolio tracking, as well as the core features such as automatic tax-form generation, work consistently. Even if you are using an obscure exchange or want to sync transaction data for rare tokens, as long as you import the information correctly, CoinTracker is likely to handle the rest accurately and reliably. Support CoinTracker’s customer support receives almost exclusively positive feedback. Users on Trustpilot have given it a score of 4.7 out of 5 based on a whopping 1600+ reviews. According to the majority of testimonials, the team helps troubleshoot complex imports and tax-form exports and provides quick assistance. CoinTracker Pros and Cons Pros: Extensive integrations: The platform can connect to over 500 exchanges and wallets, providing broad import coverage. Strong support for tax reporting: CoinTracker allows you to generate IRS-ready tax forms, export them to TurboTax (or other) and apply multiple cost-basis methods. User-friendly portfolio dashboard: You’re able to monitor the entirety of your portfolio in a single unified dashboard, which also offers powerful accounting insights. Proactive alerting: CoinTracker also comes with features such as tax-loss harvesting and a detailed breakdown of tax-lots. Cons: Advanced features locked behind higher tiers: some of the optimization tools (such as full tax-loss harvesting) will require you to upgrade to a higher-tier plan. Manual work still required for lesser-known exchanges: The import automation is less perfect for niche chains and lesser-known platforms. Support limitations: Premium support is reserved for top-tier plan customers. CoinTracker Alternatives & Comparison Considering your alternatives is always important.

Expert Says Get Ready, It’s Coming",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-20-confirmed-expert-says-get-ready-its-coming/,"Crypto analyst Amonyx (@amonbuy) has shared a chart highlighting a long bullish pennant on XRP’s monthly timeframe. He told investors to prepare for XRP to hit $20, showing his conviction in the setup. The chart shows the asset moving within a clear pennant while holding above a major support area. The structure has taken years to form, and now sits near the end of its consolidation phase. The pattern suggests that XRP may expand rapidly once its price closes above the upper trend line. CONFIRMED ￼ Get ready for #XRP to hit $20+… It's coming! pic.twitter.com/5UFX1nQQqe — Amonyx (@amonbuy) November 17, 2025 Historical Pattern Reference The chart compares the current formation with the pennant that formed before the 2017 surge. That earlier move produced a rapid breakout. Amonyx used this comparison to show how a similar pattern may lead to the next stage of price action. He marked the asset’s 2018 peak on the monthly chart, showing the scale of the potential move. This structure mirrors the historical pattern and spans from 2018 to 2024. It is larger and longer than the earlier one, signaling strong compression. The breakout point on the chart sits near $1.04. XRP broke above this level in late 2024 and has remained above it. The current candle cluster sits around $2.7, near the center of the pattern. XRP’s price action now presses against the upper boundary, nearing a breakout. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Measured Move Projection Amonyx used the earlier pennant as a guide for the projected target. The chart shows a gain of almost 5,250% during the last expansion. He applied a similar measurement to the present pattern. This measured move suggests that XRP is heading to double digits. While Amonyx specified that XRP could surpass $20, the chart shows a target of $64.38. This is s far above XRP’s previous trading range, placing it firmly into double-digit territory . What to Expect from XRP The chart shows how XRP has held the pattern through several tests. Lower wicks show repeated support touches. Upper wicks show steady rejection at the same trend line. This type of compression often signals a strong move ahead. With XRP now well above the upper boundary, Amonyx expects its price to accelerate soon. At the time of his analysis, the asset traded at $2.76. While it has dropped since then, his analysis suggests an imminent resurgence .

54565441,629602,1763460800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54565441.jpeg,Is Another Bitcoin Crash Coming? Why Network Health Is the Real Issue and How Bitcoin Hyper Can Help,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-crashes-below-90k-bitcoin-hyper-presale/,"Quick Facts: Bitcoin continued with its downtrend after it sank below $90K in the last 24 hours, leading to over $500M worth of positions liquidated. It also saw a death cross, where the short-term MA went below the long-term one, which could signal further drops ahead. Market volatility often highlights Bitcoin’s network limitations, such as slow speeds and high fees during peak traffic. Bitcoin Hyper offers a Layer-2 solution that brings Solana-like speed and smart contract functionality to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Market volatility is stirring again, leaving many traders asking the same question: will Bitcoin ($BTC) crash again? While price action dominates headlines, a deeper issue often fuels market anxiety. Bitcoin’s own network limitations, like slow transaction speeds and high fees, can amplify panic. In the last 24 hours, $BTC sank below $90K, wiping out $568.08M worth of $BTC positions , with $406.32M longs accounting for a bulk of the liquidations. In addition, the coin drew a death cross, where its short-term moving average (MA) dropped below its long-term MA. This signals that a further slide could occur. When the market moves quickly, the Bitcoin network often struggles to keep up. Transaction confirmation times can stretch from minutes into hours, while fees – or gas – can skyrocket. This congestion creates a bottleneck, trapping users who want to move assets to exchanges to sell or for cold storage for safety. This isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s a critical flaw that can exacerbate a sell-off. If you can’t move your $BTC when you need to, you can’t react quickly to market changes. This fundamental scalability problem has long been Bitcoin’s biggest challenge, preventing it from supporting a vibrant ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). That reality is now changing. A new wave of innovation is focused on building Layer-2 solutions that inherit Bitcoin’s security while dramatically improving its performance. These protocols aim to solve the very issues that contribute to network stress during a potential Bitcoin crash. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a project leading this charge by bringing unprecedented speed and smart contract functionality to the original blockchain. Bitcoin Hyper Unlocks a High-Speed Layer for $BTC Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is developing a modular architecture that finally solves Bitcoin’s core limitations. Once it launches, it will leverage Bitcoin Layer-1 for settlement, while a high-performance Layer-2 handles transaction execution. This design brings Solana-level speed directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem. At its core is the integration of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) , renowned for its parallel processing capabilities. This will allow Bitcoin Hyper to execute smart contracts quickly and cheaply, something impossible on Bitcoin’s base layer. The market has taken notice of this breakthrough. Its ongoing presale has already attracted significant capital, raising an impressive $27.8M. On-chain data shows a whale buy worth over $500K, signaling that smart money sees its long-term potential. To get a full lowdown on the project, be sure to check out our detailed Bitcoin Hyper review . Building a DeFi and dApp Ecosystem on Bitcoin The implications of this technology extend far beyond faster payments. By enabling smart contracts, Bitcoin Hyper will open the door for a full suite of decentralized applications to be built on Bitcoin for the first time. This includes DeFi protocols for lending and staking, dynamic NFT platforms, and even complex on-chain games. Developers can use familiar tools like Rust to build and deploy dApps quickly. The project will also provide a Canonical Bridge for seamless $BTC transfers between layers, ensuring liquidity and user access remain simple and secure. Bitcoin Hyper’s native token, $HYPER, will be central to this new economy, enabling governance participation and staking rewards for those who help secure the network. With immediate staking available after its TGE, the project is building a community-driven ecosystem from day one. For now, you can buy $HYPER tokens via the Bitcoin Hyper presale page for $0.013295 each. You can also stake them after your purchase to earn 41% APY in staking rewards. Discover how to join the $HYPER presale in our guide to buying Bitcoin Hyper . Meanwhile, our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction sees a potential high of $0.20 for the token by the end of 2026. Naturally, various factors will have to come together to make this happen, such as meeting the project’s roadmap and launching a Layer-2 that truly delivers on this promise. But don’t delay because a new price increase is imminent. So, act quickly, as this could be your last chance to buy $HYPER at a steep discount. Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale today.

Apeing Whitelist Leads the Best Meme Coin Talk as Pepe and Fartcoin Regain Spark,https://timestabloid.com/are-new-meme-coins-setting-up-the-next-run-apeing-whitelist-leads/,"A single action on a smartphone can spark a shift that reshapes an entire strategy. With online interactions, entertainment layers, and digital communities accelerating globally, meme-coins are becoming cultural artifacts rather than temporary trends. Fartcoin, once treated as nothing more than comedic relief, now drives lively discussions across platforms. Pepe continues generating buzz with its evolving visual style and sudden market jolts. These waves of hype push traders to evaluate which meme coin could break out as attention consolidates. Whether it’s Fartcoin’s sharp rallies or Pepe’s unpredictable spikes, both coins reinforce the same lesson: hesitation costs more than volatility. As users search for early entry pathways that remove confusion and guesswork, they gravitate toward systems built for timing precision. This movement fuels rising interest in the Apeing Whitelist, a structured, presale-linked route tailored for traders following the best meme coin debates and aiming to secure placement ahead of the next surge.

Fartcoin: Humor-Driven Buzz With Volatility at the Center Fartcoin stepped into meme-coin circles through humor and online jokes, yet the token now commands real visibility. Recent activity has shown daily swings near 4 percent, sparking lively reactions among short-term traders. Its branding attracts users who enjoy lighthearted tokens with sharp price movements. Fartcoin’s appeal grows during viral moments, especially when social posts highlight the coin’s playful identity. Traders approach Fartcoin cautiously because performance depends heavily on trending culture. Sharp climbs often appear when online engagement spikes, but pullbacks can form just as quickly. This unpredictability attracts adventurous traders but complicates long-term tracking. Even so, Fartcoin stays present through community energy and meme-driven trends that keep engagement steady. Pepe: A Cultural Icon With Surprising Underperformance Trends Pepe holds one of the strongest cultural footprints among meme assets. Its character is recognizable across generations of internet communities. The token often reacts quickly to sentiment, with recent price moves close to 3 percent during active hours. Pepe attracts traders who enjoy movement tied to humor, art, and community messaging. These qualities help Pepe maintain relevance even when markets turn quieter. Despite its identity, Pepe sometimes underperforms during broad market rallies. Larger macro shifts can overshadow its momentum, creating slower growth during high-volume periods. Traders watch Pepe track social trends and media bursts for timing cues. Its cultural strength supports long-term visibility, but inconsistent performance reminds users that sentiment alone does not guarantee steady gains. Pepe remains a powerful brand in meme-coin culture, though results vary with market conditions. Timing Creates Outcomes That Charts Cannot Predict Alone Crypto rewards swift positioning more than delayed responses. Traders who act early often gain stronger setups than those who wait for confirmation. Timing becomes a strategy, not a gamble, when access methods remain structured. The Apeing Whitelist reflects this idea with verified placement and clear instructions that help users enter before public interest rises. Early certainty helps users navigate volatile cycles with more confidence than reactionary approaches. Conclusion Pepe ETF rumors and new Fartcoin fund discussions continue circulating across social groups. These updates stir speculation and create short bursts of excitement. As traders evaluate these stories, they revisit early-access methods and examine options aligned with future movement. This reflection directs attention toward Apeing , especially for those exploring the best meme coin narratives during rising market momentum. The whitelist provides timing, preparation, and structured onboarding during periods when clarity becomes a competitive advantage.
