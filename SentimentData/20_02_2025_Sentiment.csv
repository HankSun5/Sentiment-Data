The Securities and Exchange Commission acknowledged WisdomTree’s bid to list and trade exchange-traded fund shares for an ( XRP ) trust. This acknowledgment initiates a 21-day public comment period, allowing the public to provide feedback on how the agency should approach WisdomTree’s application. Comment periods officially open after the SEC adds a filing to the Federal Register. Over the last few days, several prospective XRP ETF filings joined the Federal Register.

Bitcoin Demand Weakens, Increasing Price Correction Risks Bitcoin demand growth has weakened substantially. After a surge in November-December 2024, partly fueled by U.S. election results, demand has sharply declined from 279,000 on December 4, 2024 to just 70,000 today. This decline in demand is further reflected in ETF activity. Bitcoin ETF net inflows, which peaked at 18,000 BTC, have reversed to a net outflow of 1,000 BTC, signaling a pullback in investor confidence. Demand for Bitcoin from Spot ETFs is less than half of what it was at this point last year. Net inflows 2025: 41K Bitcoin 2024: 100K Bitcoin ETFs are simply not buying as much so far this year. pic.twitter.com/IjDGSRrvn9 — Julio Moreno (@jjcmoreno) February 19, 2025 CryptoQuant’s Inter-exchange Flow Pulse highlights declining spot Bitcoin demand in the U.S., as fewer BTC are moving from other exchanges to Coinbase. The metric recently fell below its 90-day moving average , suggesting reduced buying interest among both institutional and retail investors. This trend raises the likelihood of an extended price correction. CryptoQuant Data Shows Weak Liquidity Inflows from Stablecoins Despite stablecoins reaching a record $200 billion in total market capitalization, their expansion rate has decelerated sharply. The 60-day change in USDT’s market cap has dropped 92%, declining from $20.4 billion on December 16 to just $1.5 billion today. A recovery in stablecoin liquidity could play a key role in supporting Bitcoin’s price stability. Without a sustained influx of liquidity, Bitcoin may struggle to regain upward momentum. In addition to weak demand and slowing liquidity, Bitcoin network activity has fallen to its lowest level in a year, declining 17% since peaking in November 2024. CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin Network Activity Index has slipped below its 365-day moving average for the first time since July 2021, when China banned Bitcoin mining. This trend suggests reduced on-chain demand, reinforcing bearish conditions. With demand weakening, liquidity inflows slowing, and network activity declining, Bitcoin remains vulnerable to further price corrections unless a shift in market conditions reverses these trends. Investing in Uncertain Times As Bitcoin faces pressure on multiple fronts, the discussion invites readers to embrace reflective decision-making. The combination of subdued demand, tepid liquidity, and quiet network activity offers an opportunity to rethink one’s approach to digital investments . It raises a critical question: how should one manage exposure in a market characterized by continuous flux? Rather than chasing temporary optimism, this period calls for a disciplined appraisal of risk and potential. Each piece of market data contributes to a broader narrative, urging investors to craft strategies that are both measured and informed.

CryptoQuant data shows that $450M in USDT flowed into centralized exchanges, the highest level since February 3. Liquidity is flowing back to exchanges, with $450M deposited in the past 24 hours. The inflows are the highest since February 3. The net inflows show more stablecoins were moved to markets than were taken out. The recent spike in net inflows suggests a bigger market move may follow. The positive net flows follow a recent liquidity injection , where briefly as much as $2.7B in stablecoins entered the markets. This time, USDT was the more active stablecoin. Inflows of USDT and USDC may signal both bullish attitudes or the need to cover leveraged positions. Exchange inflows and outflows shift their direction more rapidly in the past few months, immediately responding to shifts in sentiment. The increased inflows followed a turbulent day for the crypto markets, where Bitcoin (BTC) hovered between the $95,000 and $97,000 range, while Solana (SOL) returned to levels from the end of 2024. The recent stablecoin inflows follow ongoing ‘buying the dip’ as more BTC is making its way into accumulation addresses . Stablecoins increase overall supply, remain top gas burners The exchange flows are reflecting the increased supply of top stablecoins. UDSC added 8.7B tokens in the past month, while USDT expanded its supply by 5.1B tokens. Stablecoins are already showing liquidity is waiting on the sidelines, with $226.8B available through leading dollar-denominated assets. The supply of all stablecoins increased by 7.79% in the past month, but the tokens stayed less active. Up to 30.3M addresses spent stablecoins, though the activity is down by 26.7% in the past month. The increased inflows suggest stablecoin holders may be reawakening. Tether’s smart contract remains the biggest gas burner for Ethereum. The recent supply injection follows increased gas usage in the past couple of days. USDT remains highly active on Ethereum, making use of the currently favorable transaction fees. Tether still burns over 5.1% of all gas on Ethereum. Circle’s USDC token has a less busy contract, with 2.53% of gas burns in a 24-hour period. Both USDT and USDC had some of their most active days on January 20 and February 3, showing stablecoins reacted immediately to market shifts and opportunities. Exchanges hold $42B in dry powder While exchange reserves for BTC and Ethereum (ETH) are near all-time lows, stablecoins have accumulated on most markets. The overall liquidity on exchanges increased in the past weeks, rising to $42.4B . The liquidity is not yet deployed, as trader behavior signaled ‘fear’ , based on the Bitcoin fear and greed index. Exchanges hold peak USDT reserves, though the biggest inflows went to derivative exchanges, most prominently Binance. | Source: Cryptoquant One of the curious changes for stablecoin usage is that spot exchanges have seen almost constant outflows. The big shift in dry powder is on derivative exchanges. Binance’s inflows were the steepest, as over $28B of the available liquidity is locked on the exchange. Bybit also saw a steep rise in stablecoin inflows, so far accumulating $3.1B. Smaller markets like Crypto.com have accrued $410M in available liquidity. Not all exchanges see the same available stablecoins for trading, and Binance may still lead during the next part of the cycle. Open interest is shifting downward for riskier stablecoins, while still remaining relatively low for blue chips like BTC and ETH. However, the available dry powder reveals a preparation for a shift in sentiment and for rebuilding leveraged positions. For now, not all of the liquidity is deployed, as traders are more cautious. However, the accumulation of stablecoins may not mean direct buying, but even more speculative trading in derivatives. The collection of simple spot exchanges holds a fraction of the available USDT liquidity.

Bitcoin, the flagship digital currency, is trading at $95,695, reflecting a slight uptick of 0.26% from its previous close. In tandem with these market movements, Hong Kong is actively bolstering its status as a regional digital assets hub. The Securities and Futures Commission has granted nine digital asset trading platform licenses, with eight more applications under review. This regulatory momentum is complemented by media expansion efforts, such as Elon Musk’s platform, X, launching its inaugural business news show, “From the Desk of Anthony Pompliano,” hosted by the renowned Bitcoin commentator. Amidst these developments, Qubetics ($TICS) emerges as a groundbreaking player, addressing real-world challenges that its predecessors have yet to tackle. By introducing a Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, Qubetics is poised to revolutionize how businesses, professionals, and individuals engage with blockchain and digital finance, offering solutions that are both innovative, practical and one of the top cryptos to hold for short term. Qubetics: Pioneering Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics isn’t just another name in the crypto space—it’s a game-changer. At its core lies the Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace , designed to bring traditional assets into the digital age, making ownership and investment more accessible than ever before. For businesses, this marketplace offers a novel way to raise capital. By tokenizing assets, companies can attract a global pool of investors, bypassing traditional financial intermediaries. This method streamlines fundraising, reduces costs, and accelerates project timelines. Individuals, regardless of their financial standing, gain the opportunity to diversify their investment portfolios. By owning tokens representing a share in various assets, they can hedge against market volatility and explore sectors previously inaccessible to them. As of now, Qubetics is in its 22nd presale stage, with the $TICS token priced at $0.08073. The presale has garnered significant attention, raising over $13.3 million from more than 20,500 token holders, with over 480 million $TICS tokens sold. Early investors are eyeing substantial returns, with potential ROI projections of up to 20,338% as the platform matures and gains traction in the market and becomes the Top Cryptos to Hold for Short Term. Bitcoin: The Digital Gold Standard Bitcoin (BTC) continues to dominate the cryptocurrency space. Currently trading at $95,695, it has seen a minor increase of 0.26% from the previous close. Despite a 14% decline since its all-time high in January, Bitcoin remains the ultimate digital asset for both new and seasoned investors. Bitcoin’s unwavering dominance in the cryptocurrency market is driven by several key factors. Market confidence remains a significant force, with Bitcoin’s market capitalization far exceeding that of any other cryptocurrency, solidifying its position as digital gold. Institutional adoption continues to grow, as major financial institutions integrate Bitcoin into their portfolios, reinforcing its stability and long-term potential. Additionally, regulatory developments in key financial hubs like Hong Kong are fostering broader cryptocurrency integration, potentially accelerating institutional adoption on a larger scale. These factors collectively ensure Bitcoin’s continued leadership in the digital asset space. Analysts remain bullish about Bitcoin’s future. Anthony Scaramucci, head of a leading crypto ETF, projects Bitcoin could reach $200,000 in 2025, citing U.S. reserves for Bitcoin as a driving force. His ETF reported a 74% return in 2024, driven by investments in key industry players like MicroStrategy and Coinbase. This performance follows its all-time high of $109,071 in January 2025, marking a 14% decline since that peak. Meanwhile, Monero, a prominent privacy-focused cryptocurrency, is priced at $236.09, showing a modest increase of 0.46% from its last close. Moreover, Bitcoin continues to gain mainstream attention. Elon Musk’s platform, X, recently launched a business news show featuring Anthony Pompliano, solidifying Bitcoin’s role in financial discourse reinforcing its position as one of the top cryptos to hold for short term. Monero: The Privacy Powerhouse Monero (XMR) is the go-to cryptocurrency for those who prioritize privacy. Currently priced at $236.09, it has recorded a modest 0.46% increase from its previous close. Monero’s unique attributes make it an invaluable asset in a world where financial privacy is under constant scrutiny. Key reasons why Monero remains a strong contender Unlike Bitcoin, Monero transactions are completely anonymous, making it impossible to trace sender and receiver details. Every XMR coin is identical to another, preventing blacklisting and censorship of specific coins. The Monero Research Lab continuously enhances the blockchain’s privacy features, ensuring it stays ahead of surveillance tactics and one of the top cryptos to hold for short term. Despite its advantages, Monero has faced regulatory challenges. In late 2024, Kraken delisted Monero in Europe due to increasing scrutiny on privacy coins. However, the project’s community remains steadfast, working on solutions to ensure Monero remains accessible worldwide. Conclusion: The Best Cryptos to Hold for Short-Term Gains Whether it’s Bitcoin’s unwavering dominance, Monero’s privacy-centric approach, or Qubetics’ groundbreaking asset tokenization, each of these cryptocurrencies offers unique advantages. While Bitcoin provides a solid store of value and Monero ensures financial privacy, Qubetics is reshaping the landscape with its real-world asset tokenization. The opportunity to invest early in Qubetics’ presale is rapidly closing. With over $13.3 million raised and massive projected ROIs, $TICS stands as the most promising crypto for short-term gains. Those who recognize the potential now are setting themselves up for massive financial growth in the evolving digital economy. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics different from Bitcoin and Monero? Qubetics introduces real-world asset tokenization, allowing users to invest in tangible assets like real estate, fine art, and luxury goods, unlike Bitcoin and Monero, which primarily function as digital currencies. Why is Bitcoin considered the best store of value in crypto? Bitcoin’s limited supply, institutional adoption, and market dominance make it the most trusted cryptocurrency for storing value over time. How does Monero ensure privacy in digital transactions? Monero uses advanced cryptographic techniques like ring signatures and stealth addresses to conceal transaction details, ensuring complete financial privacy. What is real-world asset tokenization, and how does Qubetics implement it? Real-world asset tokenization involves converting tangible assets into digital tokens for fractional ownership. Qubetics enables this process through its blockchain-powered marketplace. Is Qubetics’ presale a good opportunity for short-term investors? Yes, with over $13.3 million raised and significant projected ROI, Qubetics offers a lucrative short-term investment opportunity before its presale ends.

Here’s what experts say,https://crypto.news/crypto-casino-meme-coins-hype/,"The crypto market is thriving, but meme coins dominate trading volumes. Are they fueling mass adoption or steering the industry toward a short-term, casino-like mentality? Experts weigh in. Table of Contents Hype, politics, and billions Are meme coins a liquidity drain or gateway to crypto? The role of platforms like Pump.fun Who’s responsible for the meme coins hype? Why do traders keep coming back? The LIBRE scandal and what comes next Hype, politics, and billions Meme coins are no longer a fringe element of the crypto market — they’ve become its driving force, fueling an era of speculation, volatility, and cultural transformation. Platforms like Pump.fun , a Solana ( SOL ) based launchpad, have made it easier than ever for anyone to create and trade meme tokens instantly, establishing themselves as the epicenter of viral token launches. Since its debut in January 2024, Pump.fun has facilitated the creation of over six million meme coins, the vast majority serving no purpose beyond speculation. The craze has even spilled into political circles, intertwining finance, hype, and governance. In Argentina, President Javier Milei faced backlash over his alleged endorsement of the LIBRA meme coin, a token that soared and then collapsed within hours, leaving retail investors nursing heavy losses. The fallout sparked a political firestorm, with opposition leaders demanding his impeachment. Meanwhile, in the U.S., just days before his inauguration, Donald Trump’s own meme coin — named Official Trump ( TRUMP ) — experienced a meteoric rise , reaching a $15 billion market cap before retreating to $3.35 billion as of Feb. 19. Adding to the spectacle, Melania Trump also launched her own token, Melania Meme ( MELANIA ), which also attracted billions in trading volume. With retail traders pouring billions into assets often devoid of fundamental utility, crypto.news reached out to industry experts to assess whether meme coins are draining liquidity and stifling innovation, or are they onboarding a new wave of investors into digital assets? Let’s dive into the debate. Are meme coins a liquidity drain or gateway to crypto? A key argument in favor of meme coins is their ability to attract fresh capital and onboard users who might not have engaged with crypto otherwise. Unlike technical blockchain projects, meme coins don’t require an understanding of staking mechanisms, interoperability, or smart contract security. Instead, their appeal lies in simplicity — catchy branding, viral marketing, and a low barrier to entry. Daria Morgen, Head of Research at Changelly, rejects the idea that meme coins are starving serious projects of liquidity. She argues that the traders flocking to these tokens wouldn’t necessarily be investing in blockchain protocols in the first place. “Many start with meme coins but eventually explore more serious projects. I don’t think meme coins necessarily divert liquidity. While some people might leave crypto altogether, most meme coin traders wouldn’t have invested in blockchain projects anyway — or they already hold assets like BTC or SOL. It’s a free market, and it’s up to utility-driven projects to attract liquidity and build their audience.” However, others argue that meme coins aren’t just absorbing retail cash but also altering broader market dynamics, making it harder for legitimate projects to gain traction. Tobin Kuo, CEO of Seraph Studios, has experienced this shift firsthand. His company develops AAA blockchain-based role-playing games, where players can own in-game assets as NFTs and earn rewards through gameplay. But with traders chasing quick profits in meme coins, long-term projects like his are struggling to maintain engagement. “For those of us building in GameFi, this is a challenging time. Players are spending less time engaging with in-game economies, and the kind of success seen during the Axie Infinity era isn’t easily replicable in today’s ‘fast in, fast out’ trading environment. My team and I are constantly adapting, looking for ways to reintroduce deeper engagement and sustainable incentives for players.” His point reflects a growing trend in crypto. In previous cycles, speculation often centred on emerging sectors like DeFi or play-to-earn gaming. Now, much of that speculative liquidity is flowing into meme coins, leaving projects that rely on sustained participation struggling to build engaged communities. Jessica Zheng, CEO of Cycle Network, sees both sides of the debate. While she acknowledges that meme coins bring retail engagement, she also notes a growing short-term mindset that has made the industry feel increasingly hype-driven rather than focused on real development. “The meme coin boom initially started as a pushback against big capital controlling the market — a way for grassroots communities to express their frustration and take a stand. Early on, successful meme coins actually had positive external effects, drawing in Web2 users and sparking interest in Web3. But as the market has matured, meme coins have also revealed major issues. The short-term gains have attracted a lot of people who see crypto as a quick cash grab, making the industry feel more short-sighted and less focused on sustainable growth.” This shift toward short-termism is precisely what concerns Georgii Verbitskii, Founder of TYMIO. He argues that meme coins have delayed the broader market’s transition into a true altcoin bull run. “The meme coin mania has drained market liquidity. We’re seeing thousands of new meme coins launch daily, siphoning capital away from more mature tokens, DeFi protocols, and altcoins with real utility. Many investors now prefer meme coins over sound investments, which is why fundamentally strong altcoins and protocols are getting less attention.” The role of platforms like Pump.fun Meme coins wouldn’t have reached their current scale without the rise of frictionless token launchpads. Platforms like Pump.fun have fundamentally changed the game, allowing anyone—regardless of technical expertise — to create and launch a token in seconds. At first glance, this kind of innovation aligns with the ethos of decentralization — open access, low barriers to entry, and a financial system free from traditional gatekeepers. But in practice, it has also fueled an unprecedented flood of speculative tokens. The question is whether these platforms are expanding financial opportunity or enabling unsustainable, Ponzi-like cycles that erode trust in crypto. Morgen sees both sides of the argument. While she acknowledges that platforms like Pump.fun lower entry barriers, she warns that their ease of use has also made it easier for bad actors to exploit retail traders. “While platforms like this foster creativity and make token launches more accessible, they also contribute to an oversaturation of low-quality assets. This environment enables pump-and-dump schemes, making them easier to execute. Such practices can erode trust in the crypto market and push away legitimate investors.” That erosion of trust is already playing out. Retail traders, lured by the promise of quick gains, often find themselves on the losing end of highly manipulated cycles. Some meme coins launched through platforms like Pump.fun see their entire liquidity drained within hours — early adopters walk away with profits, while most buyers are left holding tokens that collapse to near-zero value. Kuo takes an even harsher stance, arguing that these platforms have shifted the core narrative of crypto from innovation to gambling. “Honestly, trust in crypto isn’t exactly at an all-time high, and with the way things are going, even industry veterans joke about the space turning into the world’s largest casino. New entrants aren’t here for decentralization or blockchain innovation — they’re just chasing money, nothing else.” Zheng acknowledges the role of open-access launch platforms but warns that an influx of low-quality tokens isn’t sustainable. “It depends on how you look at it. Zero-barrier launchpads can act as catalysts, speeding up token creation and helping promising ideas gain exposure. In that sense, they create opportunities. But a catalyst only accelerates things — it doesn’t change fundamentals. If a project lacks real value from the start, launching it faster doesn’t make it sustainable. It’s still just empty hype.” Hence, the issue isn’t the existence of these platforms—it’s how they’re being used. The problem arises when these tokens are marketed purely as speculative bets, often promoted by influencers who pump them to their followers before cashing out. Who’s responsible for the meme coins hype? From social media figures hyping new tokens to exchanges listing them for a quick volume boost, multiple industry players profit from the speculation surrounding these assets. But when retail traders lose money — often on manipulated or rug-pulled tokens — who bears the responsibility? Morgen acknowledges the free-market nature of crypto but believes platforms and influencers must act responsibly. “The crypto market has always been about DYOR. It’s a free market — meme coins will come and go, and banning them isn’t realistic. Education is key to helping traders spot scams and rug pulls. However, platforms and influencers do share some responsibility. Promoting shady projects for quick gains may drive short-term profits, but it kills trust and drives users away over time.” Kuo, however, argues that the market isn’t truly free when those with the loudest voices manipulate it. “Everyone plays a role in this, and yes, this is how the market works. But calling it a ‘free market’ is a stretch when so much of the content is driven by paid promotions and, in many cases, outright manipulation.” His point highlights a growing concern — many meme coin traders don’t base decisions on independent research but on what’s trending on X, YouTube, or Telegram. The overwhelming influence of promoters, particularly influencers shilling projects for personal gain, makes it difficult for retail traders to assess real risks. Zheng takes a more neutral stance, acknowledging the influence of platforms and influencers while pointing to their responsibility. “Exchanges and influencers shape market sentiment, and while the market is technically free, many retail traders — especially newcomers — can be swayed by their narratives without fully understanding the risks. That can lead to losses. Influential figures and platforms have a responsibility to stay neutral and objective when sharing their views. They shouldn’t just chase engagement at the expense of retail investors.” Mori Xu, co-founder of Tabi Chain, sees the issue as one of balance. While many traders take reckless bets, he believes self-regulation within the industry could help curb the worst excesses. “Influencers and platforms should take some responsibility for the content they promote. They should provide clear risk disclosures and avoid misleading investors.” Verbitskii, meanwhile, sees the cycle of hype and loss as self-correcting. He argues that painful lessons will eventually shift market behavior. “The only thing that will slow it down is painful losses. When enough people get burned, fewer will jump in blindly. That’s the nature of market cycles.” Why do traders keep coming back? Meme coins have crashed countless times. Every cycle, a handful skyrocket, creating overnight millionaires, only to collapse just as quickly, leaving a trail of losses behind. Despite this predictable boom-and-bust pattern, traders keep diving back in, pouring billions into tokens that often have no real underlying value. At first glance, this behavior seems irrational. Why would investors willingly return to a market that has repeatedly burned them? Kuo compares meme coin speculation to the emotional trading patterns that have existed in traditional markets for centuries. “This is classic Bandwagon Effect psychology — something that has played out in stock markets for centuries. Investors buy assets simply because others are making money, often without fully understanding the fundamentals. This cycle has repeated itself in both stocks and crypto, and meme coins are no exception.” For example, stocks like GameStop (GME) and AMC experienced similar hype cycles during the retail trading frenzy of 2021. The difference is that in crypto, these cycles unfold much faster — sometimes within hours or days rather than months. Xu believes meme coins are driving a deeper shift in crypto, moving the market away from fundamentals-based investing and toward narrative-driven speculation. “Despite multiple crashes, traders keep chasing meme coins because of their high return potential, social media hype, and strong community influence. The excitement and FOMO around these tokens make them impossible to ignore.” Morgen offers a different perspective, arguing that crypto traders have always been split into two distinct camps — those seeking long-term stability and those embracing high-risk speculation. “It’s almost human nature to chase quick profits. There will always be risk-averse and risk-seeking investors: the former will hodl Bitcoin (or avoid crypto altogether), and the latter will gamble on meme coins. I don’t think there’s any real shift — crypto markets have always been like this.” The LIBRE scandal and what comes next The LIBRE scandal was a turning point in the debate over meme coin regulation. When the Argentine President was linked to the token, its price surged — only to collapse within hours, wiping out millions in investor funds. With meme coins now influencing global politics and financial markets, the question is no longer whether governments should intervene but how much regulation is too much. Kuo is sceptical that regulation will have any real impact. In his view, crypto is too decentralized for government restrictions to work effectively. “This is an interesting discussion, especially with the growing calls for KYC on meme coin launchpads. Some suggest that Pump.fun should require developers to verify their identities before launching tokens. But let’s be realistic. If you regulate Pump.fun, another platform will emerge to take its place. This cycle will repeat itself — just like how CEXs gave way to DEXs when regulations tightened.” Zheng takes a more measured stance. While she agrees that decentralization should be protected, she acknowledges that certain safeguards could help prevent market manipulation and retail losses. “The LIBRE scandal showed how easily meme coins — especially those with no real substance — can be manipulated by a small group of people, which isn’t good for the market. If nothing is done, a lot of retail investors could end up getting hurt.” Xu believes the solution lies in smart regulation — rules that protect investors without imposing excessive restrictions. “The LIBRE scandal highlighted how easily meme coins can be manipulated. I think governments should step in carefully. They have a role in protecting investors and maintaining market integrity, but overregulation could stifle the decentralized spirit of crypto.” The “smart regulation” approach aligns with what some countries are already exploring. Instead of outright banning meme coins, regulators could require disclosure rules, mandate influencers to reveal paid promotions, or enforce security audits for high-risk tokens. Meanwhile, Hedi Navazan, Chief Compliance Officer at 1inch Labs, argues that the lack of oversight makes meme coins particularly vulnerable to fraud, pump-and-dump cycles, and political misuse. “There are multiple risks in issuing meme coins, including market manipulation and the use of public figures to influence price movements in favor of their inner circle. Governance and structure are key. At the World Economic Forum in Davos 2025, meme coins became a major topic of discussion, with most experts expressing concerns over high-profile launches like Melania and Trump Coins. These moves could send the wrong message to the market, potentially leading to disappointment and raising doubts instead of showcasing blockchain’s real potential.” Verbitskii, meanwhile, believes the speculative frenzy is nearing its peak. While meme coins have absorbed much of the market’s liquidity, he argues their dominance may be short-lived. “I believe the peak of this meme coin mania is behind us. The release of the TRUMP token was likely the tipping point, so now it’s time for a cooling period. Many high-profile meme coins left buyers with heavy losses, which has created a negative perception of the market and could deter future investors.” However, history suggests this cooling-off period will be temporary. New narratives — whether political meme coins, celebrity-backed tokens, or AI-generated projects — will likely emerge, reviving speculation all over again. For now, crypto remains a wild west — where high risks, high rewards, and minimal oversight define the meme coin market. Whether governments step in or not, the next phase of crypto regulation will likely be shaped by how the industry responds to scandals like LIBRE and the political meme coin boom.",Feature|Exclusive|Crypto traders|gambling|Meme Coin|politics|rug pull,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-02-19 23:26:00

Despite billions in institutional inflows, the cryptocurrency has failed to break out significantly. A brief exception occurred on January 20, coinciding with U.S. President Donald Trump’s inauguration, when Bitcoin surged to an all-time high of $109,000 before swiftly retreating into its established range. Market Manipulation Suspicions Some industry leaders believe Bitcoin’s price stagnation may not be entirely organic. Samson Mow, CEO of Jan3 and founder of Pixelmatic, suspects deliberate price suppression. Speaking at Consensus Hong Kong 2025, Mow noted: “If you look at the price movement, we peak, and then we stay steady and chop sideways. It just looks very manufactured.” Mow further emphasized the unnatural nature of Bitcoin’s restricted price fluctuations, raising concerns about external forces shaping the market. ETF Inflows and Institutional Buying Fail to Move Price Despite steady accumulation by institutions and retail investors, Bitcoin’s price remains stagnant. Companies like Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy continue to buy Bitcoin in large quantities, yet the price refuses to budge. According to Mow, this suggests that substantial selling pressure is counteracting these inflows. “If Bitcoin’s price isn’t moving despite accumulation, then someone must be selling,” he explained. FTX Repayments and Potential Sell-Off Pressure Adding to market dynamics, FTX has begun repaying creditors, distributing over $1.2 billion based on Bitcoin’s November 2022 price of around $20,000. This could lead to increased selling pressure as recipients cash in on their gains. Mow pointed out that Bitcoin sales at mid-$20K levels are likely impacting market movements, preventing upward momentum. Despite these concerns, analysts remain optimistic, with 2025 price targets ranging between $160,000 and $180,000. However, for now, Bitcoin remains firmly within its controlled price range.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-19 23:31:00

The company, which until recently operated under the name MicroStrategy, targeted a 40%-50% conversion premium for the zero-coupon convertible notes maturing in 2030 at first, but the lowered stock volatility has forced a recalibration. Hedge funds and institutional investors, who often do complex trades involving bonds and short-selling Strategy shares, have been closely watching the deal. Bloomberg data shows that Strategy’s 30-day stock volatility has dropped to less than half of its December peak, reducing the opportunity for aggressive trading strategies tied to the company’s fluctuations. Strategy’s stock sheds value, but Bitcoin holdings surge Strategy’s stock has taken a 30% hit since November, pulling back from its record highs. Despite the dip, the stock remains up more than 700% over the past three years, driven by the company’s unstoppable Bitcoin acquisition strategy. As of press time, Strategy holds 478,740 Bitcoin, representing over 2.5% of the total Bitcoin supply, worth more than $45 billion at today’s prices. The company’s decision to focus on fixed-income securities and at-the-market stock sales is part of a plan to raise $42 billion by 2027 to continue accumulating Bitcoin. The convertible debt offering is Strategy’s first since raising over $560 million through a preferred stock sale at a big discount. Meanwhile, last Wednesday, Strategy reported its fourth consecutive quarterly loss, booking a $1.01 billion impairment charge tied to its Bitcoin holdings. This compares to just $39.2 million in impairment losses in the same period last year. The company’s net loss for the quarter hit $670.8 million, or $3.03 per share, a striking contrast to the $89.1 million profit recorded a year earlier. The massive write-down comes as Strategy prepares to adopt a new accounting rule in Q1, which will allow it to measure Bitcoin at fair market value instead of recognizing impairment losses when prices drop. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Kang said the fourth quarter will be the last when it recognizes an impairment charge on its bitcoin holdings. Despite its losses, Strategy purchased 218,887 Bitcoin in the last quarter alone, spending $20.5 billion in what is the largest Bitcoin acquisition in any quarter in its history. This brings Strategy’s total holdings to 471,107 Bitcoin as of February 2, with a market value of $46 billion. CEO Phong Le confirmed on the company’s post-earnings call that fixed-income issuance, including convertible bonds and preferred stock, will be a priority in 2025 as part of its plan to continue stacking Bitcoin.

Will LTC bulls hold out for a $250 breakout? Litecoin (LTC) Continues to Gain Momentum on ETF Hype Litecoin (LTC) has experienced considerable upside in February 2025, defying downward pressure from macroeconomic headwinds. Speculation surrounding altcoin ETF approvals has been a key factor in driving up LTC prices. Litecoin (LTC) Price Action This optimism was further reinforced after the SEC’s recent acknowledgment of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) ETF filings. As seen in the chart above, LTC price has reached a 40-day peak $136 on Feb. 19, rising by another 4% within the daily timeframe. The ETF narrative continues to fuel Litecoin’s rally, as investors anticipate increased liquidity and accessibility through regulated investment vehicles. Institutional Investors Enter $512M Buying Spree Ahead of ETF Launch Positive sentiment surrounding Litecoin ETF approvals has drawn significant institutional attention in recent days, propelling LTC to a new 40-day peak on Feb. 19. A closer look at on-chain data indicates that institutional investors have been aggressively accumulating LTC behind the scenes in anticipation of the ETF launch On-chain analytics from IntoTheBlock ’s Large Holder Netflow metric highlights a sustained accumulation trend among Litecoin’s largest whale addresses since the broader crypto market downturn began on Feb. 3, following Trump’s tariff announcement. This metric tracks net balance changes in wallets holding at least 0.1% of Litecoin’s total circulating supply, offering insight into whale activity during critical market phases. Litecoin Large Holder Netflow vs. LTC Price | Source: IntoTheBlock According to the data, Litecoin’s largest holders have maintained positive net inflows since Feb. 3. Over the past two weeks, these whale wallets have acquired a cumulative 4.68 million LTC, valued at approximately $512 million. Notably, Litecoin’s price has surged 42.3% since the buying spree began, climbing from lows of $98.42 on Feb. 4 to a 40-day peak of $136 on Feb. 19. Why Is Litecoin Price Going Up? Institutional accumulation suggests that major stakeholders are positioning ahead of a potential ETF approval. This level of sustained buying activity, despite broader market uncertainties, underscores the strategic interest in Litecoin among institutional players. The persistent buying spree among whales suggests that institutional and high-net-worth investors continue to build LTC positions as the probability of an ETF approval increases. A few factors could drive further institutional accumulation as the launch date approaches, including fulfilling reserve requirements, regulatory compliance, and portfolio diversification strategies. Institutional holders accumulating Litecoin may be looking to hold until the ETF is officially launched, capitalizing on the upside from euphoria. Likewise, OTC desks, aiming to provide operational services for brokers and exchanges listing Litecoin ETFs, could also extend their holding periods, reducing short-term circulating supply. Evidently, this narrative has played a crucial role in Litecoin’s 42% price surge over the past 14 days. If this accumulation trend continues, Litecoin’s price could extend its rally toward the highly anticipated $250 breakout level in the days ahead. LTC Price Forecast: $150 Breakout Could Trigger Further Upside Litecoin price forecast remains cautiously bullish as LTC approaches a critical resistance zone, bolstered by strong technical indicators. The recent rally has seen Litecoin climb 42.25% over the past 15 days, now trading at $135.90. This surge follows a bullish breakout from a consolidation phase, marked by a double-bottom reversal pattern. The upward trajectory has been accompanied by increasing trading volume, signaling strong market participation. Litecoin (LTC) Price Forecast The Bollinger Bands show widening volatility, with LTC now testing the upper resistance at $139.58. A decisive breakout above this level could open the door to the psychological $150 target. Parabolic SAR dots beneath the price further validate the bullish trend, suggesting sustained upward momentum. Meanwhile, the RSI at 62.46 remains below the overbought threshold, indicating room for further gains without immediate correction pressure. However, the bullish outlook faces risks. A failure to breach the $139.58 resistance could trigger a pullback toward the $117.19 mid-Bollinger level. If bearish pressure intensifies, Litecoin could revisit the Parabolic SAR support at $105.27. For now, maintaining price action above $130 keeps bulls in control, with $150 remaining a key upside target.

With the SEC’s acknowledgment , a three-week comment period has begun. This enables interested parties — investors, industry experts, and the general public — to submit comments on how the agency should assess WisdomTree’s proposal. The SEC will review these comments before determining whether to approve, reject, or postpone the application. Official comments will not start until a filing is posted in the Federal Register. Institutional interest in the XRP has recently increased significantly, as several XRP ETF applications have appeared in the Federal Register in recent weeks.

His tenure has marked a notable shift in regulatory approach, including the suspension of enforcement actions against major crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase. Uyeda has also led the creation of a new Crypto Task Force to produce a proposed framework for how the SEC will oversee digital assets. In addition, the political environment has enhanced institutional faith in crypto ETFs.

While regulatory clarity remains a concern, financial giants are positioning themselves for the next market cycle. The increasing demand for Ethereum signals confidence in its role within global finance. Meanwhile, an AI coin, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , currently priced at just $0.0420, is catching investors’ attention, promising innovation in its blockchain-powered artificial intelligence . As institutional players move strategically, these assets could define the next phase of crypto adoption. Big Banks Are Bullish On Ethereum And AI Coin Promising Exponential Gains In a significant shift within the financial sector, big banks increasingly embrace digital assets, with Ethereum and WallitIQ (WLTQ) emerging as focal points of interest. Recent data indicates that big banks’ investments in cryptocurrencies reached $17 billion in the first quarter of 2024, up from $13 billion during the same period in 2023. This surge underscores the growing confidence among big banks in the potential of blockchain technologies. Another notable development is Visa’s announcement of the Visa Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP), built on Ethereum. This platform enables Visa to issue and manage fiat-backed tokens, signaling a significant move toward crypto adoption. The initiative is set to pilot with Spanish multinational bank BBVA in 2025, highlighting the strategic interest of big banks in Ethereum’s capabilities. The convergence of big banks’ interest in Ethereum and the rise of AI coins reflects a broader trend of integrating advanced technologies into financial services. WallitIQ (WLTQ), a high-value AI coin, is leading the charge, with its presale boasting over $7 million in investments. This AI coin is attracting attention for its innovative applications, blending AI with blockchain to create decentralized solutions. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Feature-Rich Platform Gains Market Dominance Amid Institutional Adoption Reimagining crypto management, WallitIQ (WLTQ) ushers in a new era of control by introducing its feature-rich platform . This platform is a sophisticated yet intuitive wallet management system that allows users to organize their holdings. Supporting Ethereum and Tether (USDT), the recently announced app will enable users to view, track, and interact with their digital assets without the usual complexity. Sending and receiving crypto has never been easier. With WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) QR code generation for wallet addresses, the platform eliminates the hassle of manually copying and pasting long alphanumeric strings. This makes transactions quick, error-free, and secure. Investors can quickly transfer funds without worrying about losing their assets due to manual errors. WallitIQ (WLTQ) also introduces simulated transactions of ETH and USDT to external addresses, a feature that allows users to practice transactions without financial risk. Whether testing out wallet interactions or training for real-world usage, this feature provides an invaluable way to refine digital payment methods in a safe environment. Meanwhile, a key challenge for any investor is keeping up with price movements, and WallitIQ (WLTQ) confirms that users are always equipped with the latest data. Through CoinGecko API integration, real-time market tracking brings live pricing directly into the app, removing the need to switch between multiple platforms to check market trends. For a crypto platform like WallitIQ (WLTQ) , security is paramount, and this project has taken extensive measures to earn user trust. With a smart contract audit conducted by SolidProof , the platform has undergone rigorous security assessments to validate its integrity and reliability. This means investors can engage with the platform confidently, knowing that its infrastructure has been verified by one of the industry’s most respected auditing firms. Institutional Shift Strengthens Investor Confidence In WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Ongoing Presale Ethereum’s growing presence among institutional investors highlights its strengthening position in global finance. As big banks discreetly expand their ETH holdings, the market anticipates a shift that could drive long-term value. With blockchain technology reshaping industries, Ethereum, alongside an AI coin, remains at the forefront of decentralized applications and smart contract innovation. Meanwhile, the rising interest in AI-driven crypto projects , particularly an AI coin, underscores the sector’s evolving landscape. As institutional confidence in Ethereum solidifies, strategic investors closely watch Ethereum and this emerging AI coin.

While giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate, the real gains are often found in emerging projects that offer unique utility and high-growth potential. In 2025, a handful of standout cryptos are gaining traction, capturing the attention of both retail and institutional investors. Web3Bay is one such project, revolutionizing decentralized commerce with a marketplace free from middlemen, offering lower fees and seamless transactions. Alongside Web3Bay, XRP, Binance Coin (BNB), Near Protocol, and Tron are poised for significant gains, making them some of the most promising tokens to buy this year. Let’s break down why these five cryptos are set to skyrocket in 2025 and why Web3Bay is becoming a must-buy before its presale ends. 1. Web3Bay (3BAY) – The Future of Decentralized Commerce While most presales focus on speculation, Web3Bay delivers real-world utility, disrupting the trillion-dollar e-commerce sector. Unlike centralized platforms like Amazon and eBay, Web3Bay allows buyers and sellers to transact directly, reducing fees and eliminating third-party control. The project’s presale has already raised over $1.50 million, with 370 million tokens sold. Investors are flocking to 3BAY tokens, as the presale price of $0.00456 is expected to soar to $0.1959 upon launch, offering a massive 4,200% ROI for early adopters. Why Web3Bay is the Best Token to Buy in February: Decentralized Marketplace – No middlemen, lower fees, and full user control over transactions. Smart Contract Escrow – Secure, trustless transactions prevent fraud and disputes. Multi-Payment Support – Accepts both crypto and fiat payments (including PayPal). Staking Rewards – Earn passive income by holding 3BAY tokens. DAO Governance – Token holders have voting power, ensuring a community-driven ecosystem. With blockchain adoption growing, Web3Bay is set to be one of the most transformative investments of 2025. As the presale closes soon, this could be the last chance to get in before prices surge. 2. XRP (XRP) – The Cross-Border Payments Giant XRP has solidified its place as one of the most widely used digital assets in global finance, powering cross-border transactions through RippleNet. Designed to replace traditional banking systems, XRP offers faster, cheaper, and more efficient transactions than SWIFT. Recent legal victories against the SEC have reignited investor confidence, with analysts now predicting that XRP could hit $10 in this bull cycle. With ETF applications under review and institutional adoption rising, XRP’s trajectory is looking bullish. As more financial institutions adopt XRP for real-world payments, its demand is expected to surge, making it a top crypto to buy for long-term gains. 3. Binance Coin (BNB) – The Utility Powerhouse of the Binance Ecosystem Binance remains the largest cryptocurrency exchange globally, and BNB is the backbone of its ecosystem. Used for trading fee discounts, DeFi applications, and NFT transactions, BNB has immense utility and continuous demand. Binance Smart Chain (BSC) has also become a hub for DeFi and gaming projects, with billions in total value locked (TVL). As Binance expands regulatory compliance and institutional partnerships, BNB is set to be a major beneficiary. With staking rewards, DeFi integrations, and growing institutional use cases, BNB remains a top investment for long-term holders looking for stability and upside potential. 4. Near Protocol (NEAR) – The Ethereum Alternative for Fast, Low-Cost Transactions Near Protocol is emerging as a scalable alternative to Ethereum, offering high-speed transactions with minimal fees. Built for DeFi applications, NFT marketplaces, and smart contracts, NEAR’s ecosystem is rapidly expanding. With the introduction of Aurora, a Layer-2 scaling solution, NEAR now offers full Ethereum compatibility, allowing developers to migrate seamlessly. The protocol’s sharding technology ensures ultra-fast transaction processing, making it an attractive choice for developers and businesses. As blockchain adoption grows, NEAR’s efficiency and cost-effectiveness make it one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025, with potential for exponential growth. 5. Tron (TRX) – The Leader in Decentralized Finance and Digital Content Tron has positioned itself as a dominant force in DeFi, gaming, and digital content. With billions in total value locked (TVL), Tron’s ecosystem has attracted millions of users worldwide. From stablecoin transactions to DeFi lending platforms, Tron is a high-speed blockchain designed for scalability. Its low transaction fees and high throughput have made it a go-to network for developers and content creators. With more partnerships in gaming, NFTs, and Web3 applications, Tron’s ecosystem is only growing stronger. TRX remains a top investment for those looking to capitalize on DeFi and blockchain-based entertainment. Final Thoughts While established tokens like XRP, BNB, NEAR, and TRX offer strong investment potential, Web3Bay stands out as the most exciting opportunity of 2025. By reinventing e-commerce with blockchain technology, Web3Bay is tackling real-world inefficiencies, making it a high-utility token with massive upside potential. With over $1.50 million raised and presale prices set to surge, now is the best time to secure 3BAY tokens before launch. Investors looking for the next 100x opportunity in crypto should act fast—once Web3Bay hits major exchanges, early adopters could see life-changing returns. Will you wait for Web3Bay’s market debut or seize the opportunity before prices skyrocket? The choice is yours.

Chainlink price key levels are being monitored for critical support, BNB is surging, and BlockDAG’s presale is attracting attention with over $196 million raised and 18.5 billion BDAG coins distributed. Its FINALCALL700 bonus offers a 350% multiplier for early participants, a significant opportunity before BDAG’s launch. This combination of Chainlink price key levels, BNB’s surge, and BlockDAG’s presale success highlights the current market’s diverse opportunities. Let’s examine each development. Chainlink Price Key Levels in Focus Chainlink price key levels currently place $18 as a significant support area for LINK. The digital asset is currently trading around $18.53. A sustained presence above this level could propel LINK toward the $22-$25 range, a zone where it has previously seen gains. Conversely, if Chainlink price key levels break below $18, it could trigger caution among those watching the market, potentially leading to a decline towards $14. Historically, Chainlink’s upward movement has been hampered by periods of low trading volume. Chainlink price key levels also highlight the importance of technical indicators such as the MACD, which has recently signaled potential short-term strength. These Chainlink price key levels could be decisive factors in determining whether the asset experiences a steady rise or a potential downturn. BNB’s Bullish Trajectory: Riding the Wave of On-Chain Activity The recent BNB surge has drawn the attention of analysts monitoring its on-chain metrics and positive indicators. Data reveals that active addresses on the BNB Chain have reached record highs, indicating a growing level of engagement with the network. This BNB surge is further supported by the movement of tokens off exchanges by spot traders, a move often interpreted as a sign of long-term holding intentions. Market observers also note that a favorable long-to-short ratio suggests the possibility of continued gains, although the overall crypto market remains subject to volatility. The BNB surge could potentially target $793.86 if it maintains support above $605.90. Traders exercising caution point out that any shift in market sentiment could impact short-term prospects. In general, the BNB surge reflects a sense of optimism, tempered by the inherent unpredictability of the market. BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700: A 350% Bonus Bonanza BlockDAG’s presale has generated significant interest, having raised over $196 million and distributed more than 18.5 billion BDAG coins. The current price of $0.0248 represents a remarkable 2,380% increase for early participants, a return that rivals some of the most successful projects in recent memory. The FINALCALL700 bonus, offering a 350% multiplier, is viewed by many as an exceptional opportunity for those seeking substantial holdings before BDAG’s official launch. Large-volume purchases by whales indicate growing confidence in BlockDAG, as these buyers accumulate BDAG in anticipation of gains once the coin is listed on major exchanges. Analysts suggest that exceeding $200 million in presale funding is a near-term possibility, with projections of $600 million or more if current levels of interest persist. BlockDAG’s potential as a leading cryptocurrency is being discussed, with many pointing out that the highest returns often originate from presale stages. BDAG appears to fit this description for many who missed out on previous market opportunities. Those eager to avoid another missed chance are capitalizing on the 350% bonus, recognizing that such a substantial multiplier might not be available again. The combination of whale accumulation, robust presale participation, and expectations of a significant price increase upon launch has created considerable excitement around BDAG, fueling speculation that this opportunity could provide substantial returns in a short time! Market Overview The cryptocurrency market is exhibiting activity across various assets. Chainlink price key levels are holding near the $18 support, with traders assessing whether LINK can advance towards the $22-$25 range or if a drop to $14 is possible. The BNB surge continues, supported by record-high network activity and strong long-term holding. If support above $605.90 remains, BNB could see further growth. Within the realm of crypto presales, BlockDAG has garnered considerable attention, offering a 350% bonus that has the potential to deliver significant returns. With over $196 million raised and 18.5 billion coins sold, BDAG is rapidly becoming a cryptocurrency of interest for traders seeking high returns. Chainlink price key levels, BNB’s surge, and BlockDAG’s presale success all point to a market filled with opportunities and potential, but also one that requires careful observation and analysis.

However, recent technical and on-chain metrics are raising red flags, prompting savvy investors to explore more promising opportunities, such as an emerging AI-powered altcoin currently in its final presale stages . Dogecoin Price: The Bullish Market Sentiment and Looming Risks Currently trading at around $0.26, Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced a modest decline of 2% in the past 24 hours, with trading volume dropping by 45%. However, despite this short-term dip, the cryptocurrency has shown remarkable resilience, boasting a year-to-date gain of over 213%. The Dogecoin price has been buoyed by strong bullish sentiment, with 76% of top traders on Binance holding long positions and a long-to-short ratio of 3.15. This optimism is further supported by significant exchange outflows, with $18 million worth of DOGE leaving exchange wallets in the past 24 hours, signaling potential accumulation by long-term holders. From a technical perspective, Dogecoin is trading within the golden Fibonacci zone, between the 50% and 61.8% retracement levels, often considered an optimal entry point for bullish traders. The cryptocurrency also remains above the 200 Exponential Moving Average on both daily and weekly charts, reinforcing the uptrend. However, not all indicators are positive. Dogecoin’s MVRV ratio recently crossed below its 200-day moving average, forming a “Death Cross” that has historically preceded significant price declines. In late 2023, a similar event led to a 26% drop, while mid-2024 saw an even steeper 44% crash. Adding to the concerns, whale activity on the Dogecoin network has plummeted by nearly 88% since mid-November, suggesting that major investors may be losing confidence in its short-term prospects. The Dogecoin price is testing critical resistance at $0.28. Failure to break through could lead to a test of lower support levels at $0.25 or even $0.22, highlighting the inherent risks in this volatile market. This Emerging Altcoin is Attracting Smart Money Amid the uncertainty surrounding the Dogecoin price, smart money is increasingly flowing into RCO Finance (RCOF) , an emerging altcoin currently in its presale phase. RCO Finance is positioning itself as a game-changer in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, offering innovative features that promise substantial returns for early investors. Its presale, now in its fifth stage, has already seen the RCOF token price surge by 684% from its initial price of $0.01275 to its current price of $0.10. The next presale stage will see the price rise to $0.13, with further increases expected as it approaches the final presale stage at $0.2142. Upon listing on crypto exchanges, the token is projected to debut at a price range of $0.4 to $0.6, with analysts forecasting an explosive rally above $1 post-listing, driven by the platform’s unique value proposition and growing community support. The allure of RCO Finance lies in its potential for massive gains, with early investors from stage one poised to achieve returns of up to 3,000% by the time the token reaches its expected listing price. This remarkable growth trajectory, combined with the project’s deflationary tokenomics — where unsold tokens are burned to enhance scarcity — makes RCOF an attractive option for investors seeking to diversify away from the volatility of the Dogecoin price. Why RCO Finance Is the Smart Choice Besides the value proposition, smart money is flowing into RCO Finance due to its cutting-edge features and robust ecosystem, which set it apart from traditional and decentralized financial platforms. At the heart of the platform is an AI-powered Robo Advisor, a machine learning-driven tool that provides personalized investment strategies tailored to users’ financial goals, risk tolerance, and market preferences. This no-code solution democratizes access to sophisticated trading strategies, enabling both novice and seasoned investors to optimize their portfolios without intermediaries, all at a low subscription cost. Users can catch early alerts 24/7, all year, on tokens with 100x potential, like the currently trending ‘ Polkadex (PDEX) ’ coin that has taken the crypto space by storm with a 132% weekly surge. Another standout feature is RCO Finance’s KYC-free ecosystem, which prioritizes user privacy and anonymity, making it particularly appealing to privacy-conscious investors. The platform also offers access to an expansive range of over 120,000 tradable assets across 12,500 asset classes, including stocks, bonds, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate and commodities. This diversity allows users to build well-balanced portfolios that mitigate risk while maximizing returns. Adding to investor confidence, RCO Finance’s smart contract has already been audited by SolidProof , ensuring security and transparency. As the team work on finalizing the platform’s development, the recently launched beta platform has attracted over 10,000 users, providing a glimpse into its seamless automation and user-friendly interface. Currently in internal testing, the highly anticipated alpha platform launch will introduce advanced monitoring facilities, further enhancing the Robo Advisor’s capabilities. Analysts predict that post-alpha launch, the price of RCOF could explode by more than 10,000%, making it a prime target for smart money seeking exponential gains as the Dogecoin price navigates through the volatile phase.

BTC remains up ~1% year to date, but is now ~10% below its record high. Ether's closing price ticked higher this week, but ETH remains down ~20% year to date and ~45% below its all-time high. XRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and the during the first month of 2025. However, it pulled back in February and is now up only ~10% year to date. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know. We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient . Bitcoin's closing price edged lower, settling just above $95,500 - its lowest level in over five weeks. BTC remains up ~1% year to date, but is now ~10% below its record high. Ether Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second-largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article. Ether's closing price ticked higher this week, but ETH remains down ~20% year to date and ~45% below its all-time high. XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. XRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and the during the first month of 2025. However, it pulled back in February and is now up only ~10% year to date. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead. On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

An announcement will come as soon as 2nd April. The president’s recent comments at his Mar-a-Lago club specified various sectors for possible tariffs, including chips, pharma, and automotive. When reporters asked him about upcoming levies on semiconductor chips, Trump said, “It’ll be 25% and higher, and it’ll go very substantially higher over a course of a year.” However, before announcing these new tariffs, he wants companies to have ample “time to come in.” He said, “When they come into the United States and they have their plant or factory here there is no tariff, so we want to give them a little bit of a chance.” Due to increasing concerns of investors, stocks in NY declined when markets opened on Wednesday, with General Motors Co. sliding 1%. As of yet, Trump did not mention whether these tariffs will be applied to specific countries. Malaysia and Singapore are highly exposed to tariffs on chips In the case of semiconductor chips, Malaysia and Singapore are probably the most exposed right now. In 2024, Malaysia exported $136 billion worth of semiconductors, becoming the sixth largest exporter. Recently, Lawrence Wong, Singapore’s Prime Minister announced that the nation will invest $744.8 million for a new semiconductor Research and Development facility. Trump hinted at the levies on semiconductor chips just a few hours after this announcement. Executives, lobby groups, and industry experts have warned that such tariffs can cause broad ripple effects in the industry, resulting in new costs and higher consumer prices. Some countries have also promised to retaliate after the tariffs take effect. How will these tariffs impact the AI industry? After taking office, Republican lawmakers suggested ending the CHIPS and Science Act. Now, we’re looking at 25% tariffs or higher, on semiconductor chip imports. Economists warn that such dual-pronged approach would potentially harm and slow down AI research in the US, and take away the nation’s competitive edge. This is because chip production and shortage of semiconductors is the biggest bottleneck for AI’s advancement. The administration promised to support the construction of US chip foundries to reduce reliance on Asia. Washington considers it a security weakness. The Commerce Department pledged to give up to $6.6 billion to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to expand its facilities in Arizona. However, Trump says that TSMC does not need money to prioritize chip production in the United States. He said, “They needed an incentive. And the incentive is going to be they’re not going to want to pay at 25, 50 or even 100% tax.” These tariffs could prove to be painful for both the consumers and manufacturers. Even giants like Nvidia could face higher costs despite having margins to absorb them for the time being.

The company says BBRL will help people and businesses make transactions more easily and safely. The Braza Group Plans for BBRL Stablecoin It is worth mentioning that Braza Group has been in the banking sector for over 15 years. Now, with the launch of BBRL, the company is moving into digital finance. According to the announcement , Braza Group said this stablecoin will give Brazilians and businesses a secure and stable way to trade and invest without the risk of sudden price changes. Similarly, Marcelo Sacomori, chief executive officer of Braza Group, said the project will help businesses manage money more efficiently and create more business opportunities. “With BBRL, we are giving people and companies a safer way to handle digital transactions. This is about more than just a new currency—it’s about shaping the future of finance in Brazil,” he explained. In addition, the firm’s CEO confirmed that BBRL will first be available to institutional clients in early 2025. After that, individuals can access it through the Braza On app. Reasons Behind Choosing the XRP Ledger Meanwhile, the statement published by Ripple Labs’ disclosed that Braza Group chose XRPL for BBRL because it is fast, secure, and can handle large transactions. Similarly, many digital asset investors have praised XRPL for making transfers quick and affordable. To complement this, Markus Infanger, Senior Vice President of RippleX, added that the XRP Ledger is a great fit for stablecoins like BBRL. Furthermore, the firm is partnering with the Brazilian Central Bank on the DREX project. The goal is to link traditional banks with blockchain technology, allowing the Central Bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) to interact more easily through a secure system. But for now, the entity is testing different ways to use blockchain technology, including digital asset management and secure bank transactions. The XRP Ledger is known to welcome amendments regularly, so it believes the chain is the best fit. A recent XRPL amendment is the NFTokenMintOffer , which went live on the mainnet last Sunday. The XRP Ledger Innovations: RLUSD Spotlight It is worth mentioning that BBRL is not the first stablecoin on XRPL. Several other digital currencies, such as Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin, have already been released on the network. This token is gaining traction and it hit a new supply milestone earlier this week. Regarding the future growth of BBRL stablecoin on the XRPL ledger, Sacomori Estimated that by 2025, Brazil will implement more regulations to support digital assets. This would eventually make the market safer to trade, ushered in by more development. He also shared that stablecoins will soon play a pertinent role in global finance. “We expect BBRL to capture about 30% of the market by the end of next year. Stablecoins are the future of digital transactions,” he said.

A crypto analyst who identified this bearish trend in the Solana price action has projected a drastic crash to new lows at $22. Solana Price Action Mirrors LUNA’s Catastrophic Collapse A pseudonymous crypto analyst on TradingView named PizzaDriver has released a recent technical analysis of the Solana price action. The market expert predicts that Solana, the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, could soon decline to drastic lows. Related Reading: Solana Price Will Complete 1,800% Surge To $4,000 With This Formation: Analyst The analyst drew parallels between Solana’s current chart structure and the LUNA meltdown of 2022. The weekly chart highlights that Solana has formed a Double Top pattern, a classic bearish reversal signal from an uptrend to a downtrend. This pattern appears like the letter “M”, creating two peaks and a dip in between. This pattern also signifies deteriorating momentum in the Solana price, as the cryptocurrency has been facing severe volatility. In addition to the Double Top pattern, Solana’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has exhibited a bearish divergence. This means that while its price attempted to reach new highs, it was unable to due to underlying weakness. This same RSI bearish divergence was observed in LUNA before its infamous market crash, which triggered a decline to a zero level. According to the TradingView analyst, if Solana fails to hold key support levels and breaks below them, it could trigger a widespread liquidity crisis that would send its price plummeting to $22, a significant historical support level last seen in 2022. Adding to the already concerning price outlook, major institutional investors appear to have already sold their holdings and taken profits at price highs. Ahead of the bull run, these investors have reportedly reallocated funds into other somewhat safer coins like Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB), which have been seeing steady growth in on-chain activities and have risen in value over the week. This redistribution increases the risk of a rapid sell-off, further weakening Solana’s fundamentals. Rug Pulls And High Fees Weigh On Solana Beyond bearish technical indicators and price forecasts, the Solana ecosystem is currently experiencing a rise in investor dissatisfaction. PizzaDriver revealed that the Solana blockchain has become a primary space for meme coins and speculative trading. Additionally, there are allegations of rug pulls and project abandonment in the ecosystem, leaving investors with a sour experience. Related Reading: Solana Forms Ascending Triangle For Possible Breakout, Analyst Sets $565 Target Many developers have allegedly created and launched projects, stolen investors’ funds, and disappeared, thus eroding trust in the network. Moreover, Solana’s transaction fees have skyrocketed, hitting record highs and contradicting its original appeal as a low-cost transaction alternative to Ethereum. As a result, investors have begun shifting focus to long-term projects with transparent roadmaps, security audits, and strong partnerships. Due to its numerous ecosystem dilemmas, the TradingView analyst disclosed that Solana risks losing its dominant position unless it addresses these fundamental challenges.

This significant event has captured the attention of the crypto community, especially with major exchanges revealing plans to list Pi Coin. The launch will mark Pi’s transition from a closed ecosystem to a fully decentralized network. The achievement of external wallet transfers together with exchange listings and decentralized applications (dApps) develops intense interest around Pi Coin price expectations. However, there are critical risks that could impact its price post-launch. 3 Major Risks That Could Tank Pi Network’s Price After Mainnet Launch The cryptocurrency world talks intensely about Pi Network as speculations rise about its upcoming mainnet launch date. The approaching launch on February 20th has triggered rising investor and expert apprehension regarding the future path of Pi Network along with its default token, Pi. From technical issues to the potential for mass selling, there are key risks that investors should be aware of. Here, we highlight three major factors that could affect Pi’s price after its mainnet launch. Binance, the largest exchange in the world, which recently launched a vote for $Pi listing, will definitely list it. The vote was just a pretext to create a lot of hype and for the OG #crypto whales to take notice and have time to prepare. Agree? #PiNetwork #Binance #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/B4k2V9zZhO — Pi Network News Global 𝛑 (@PiNewsGlobal) February 19, 2025 Technical Indicators Show Weakness Pi price charts are currently showing signs of vulnerability, with the token slipping below key support levels. In the past 24 hours, Pi Network’s IOU token has already seen a sharp 40% decline, prompting questions about its future price movement. The price has recently fallen below the $50 support level, which was previously considered a solid support level. This technical weakness could signal a further downturn in Pi’s price, especially if the trend continues after the mainnet launch. Early Miners Could Flood the Market Pi Network has a large base of early miners who have been accumulating tokens for years. The active miners operating on mainnet will probably cash out their holdings when the mainnet launches. A substantial market downturn would likely happen if the increased supply exceeds market demand during this period. The market entry of numerous coins would intensify the existing price reduction thus deepening the downward trend. Airdrop-Based Tokens Often Drop After Launch A substantial decline in value typically happens to cryptocurrencies that make their initial releases via airdrops or similar distribution methods. When Pi Network starts trading while widening its user base it may result in market flooding through airdropped tokens that trigger immediate token dumping. The history of airdrop projects shows this pattern has become standard so Pi Network may encounter the same outcome when supply exceeds market demand. The mainnet launch of Pi Network requires investors to analyze these significant risks. Investors need to approach the market with caution while tracking Pi Network project developments along with market information.

The CoinDesk Memecoin Index will track the largest fifty memecoins by market capitalization — a list that includes dogecoin (DOGE), shiba inu (SHIB), floki (FLOKI), among others — while the CoinDesk 100 serves as a single benchmark for the top hundred tokens by market cap. “CoinDesk Memecoin Index responds to traders' need for liquidity and volatility while the CoinDesk 100 provides one-stop access to the most liquid tokens,” said Chris Tyrer, VP, head of institutional at Bullish. “We are thrilled to continue providing our clients access to the broader digital asset landscape, complementing these indices with our robust regulatory framework,"" he added. The memecoin index is equal-weighted and will be rebalanced monthly, ensuring the representation of emerging and established tokens. Similarly, the CoinDesk 100 Index is market cap-weighted and provides a single reference point for structured products, ETFs, and risk management strategies. Crypto exchange Bullish has listed perpetual futures on both indices, allowing traders to gain exposure to these benchmarks with deep liquidity and around-the-clock trading.

SecondSwap uses a liquidity routing algorithm that optimizes trade execution and minimizes price slippage to ensure secure and scalable trading experiences for buyers and sellers. “By introducing a decentralized order book-style exchange, we are bringing transparency to token secondary markets,” said Kanny Lee, founder of SecondSwap, in an email to CoinDesk. “Our platform provides visibility into buy and sell orders, leveraging price discovery mechanisms such as market depth and liquidity profiling. Through seamless wallet integration, we ensure proof of control for sellers and proof of funds for buyers, enhancing security and trust.” Secondary markets for locked tokens refer to platforms or mechanisms where tokens that are under some form of lock-up or vesting schedule can be traded before they are fully released or unlocked. These markets provide a way for holders of locked tokens to gain liquidity, meaning they can convert their holdings into cash or other assets before the tokens are fully unlocked — giving early liquidity to sellers and the chance of gaining assets at a discount for buyers. SecondSwap has introduced a bid campaign to facilitate price discovery and enhance liquidity in early weeks, allowing traders to set their own prices and support matching between buyers and sellers once the buy/sell flow feature is enabled. Traders link their wallets, accessing a list of locked tokens that they can express an interest in buying by setting their preferred price target. Participants will be notified when inventory is available at prevailing prices, ensuring early adopters can engage with new opportunities as they emerge. The platform plans to expand to the Solana network in the coming months, a feat Lee says could unlock over $500 million in volume. “Locked token liquidity represents billions of dollars of untapped value. The impact of unlocking this liquidity cannot be understated. On Solana alone, even activating just 10% of dormant liquidity, could inject over $500 million in actionable volume,” Lee said. “It’s definitely one of the drivers for partnering with Solana at the outset. When coupled with the impact that SecondSwap’s vesting mechanism can offer memecoins - to reduce circulating supply - the Solana partnership will continue to flourish and benefit the wider market.”",Markets|Ethereum,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|ETH|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-20 01:00:00

The pseudonymous analyst known as Altcoin Sherpa tells his 242,900 followers on the social media platform X that he is leaning bullish on the utility token of the decentralized open financial system Hyperliquid ( HYPE ). “Best positions right now in order of best to worst: Cash. Majors. HYPE. Utility or older coins like AAVE, LINK, XRP, OM. Everything else is pretty mehhh.” HYPE is trading for $23.27, at time of writing, down 8.8% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the trader suggests that Ethereum ( ETH ) may have an explosive move this cycle, but is uncertain when. “Everyone talking about ETH and it makes a lot of sense: Top Trump projects are on ETH ( LINK, AAVE, others). SOL is pretty screwed from a mindshare perspective (rugs/etc.). No real ETH pump (yet). ETH/BTC has been f**ed. I do believe it’ll happen, just don’t know when/how.” However, he warns that in the near term, ETH may be forming a bull trap. “ETH: I’m not going to get trapped on this one.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X ETH is trading for $2,662 at time of writing, down 2.9% in the last 24 hours. Lastly, the analyst suggests that artificial intelligence (AI)-focused altcoin Artificial Superintelligence Alliance ( FET ) and AI-related memecoin Act I: The AI Prophecy ( ACT ) may have reached their market bottoms and may be poised for breakouts “I think we’re anywhere from one month to two weeks into the consolidation period for most of these shitcoins. This is the chop period where nothing much really happens, but I still feel that most of the good ones are fairly bottomed at this point. FET, ACT are two examples.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X FET is trading for $0.72 at time of writing, down 4% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, ACT is trading for $0.18 at time of writing, up 1.3% on the day.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) is riding strong technical momentum, up 22% this month, fueled by a Golden Cross pattern and growing institutional interest. Polkadot (DOT) is holding firm above $4.8, signaling resilience in a volatile market. But while these established tokens are drawing attention, Web3Bay (3BAY) is quietly emerging as the best opportunity in 2025. Its presale has already raised $1.50 million, selling 360 million tokens in record time. Unlike speculative pumps, Web3Bay is backed by real-world utility, offering a decentralized marketplace with peer-to-peer transactions, staking rewards, and DAO governance. With early investors securing tokens at $0.00456 and an expected launch price of $0.1959, Web3Bay’s upside potential is unmatched. The race to get in early is on. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Surges 22%—Can It Break Past $30? Hyperliquid (HYPE) has gained 22% this month, positioning itself as one of the best-performing altcoins. The token saw a 7.12% jump in the past 24 hours, bringing its price closer to the $30 resistance level. With a market cap of $9.08 billion and $157.7 million in daily trading volume, investor interest is rising. Technical indicators suggest further upside. The Golden Cross formation between the 50-day and 200-day EMAs signals strong buying pressure, while the MACD remains bullish, indicating sustained momentum. If HYPE breaks above $29.90, it could rally toward $35.50. However, failure to hold current levels may lead to a pullback to $24.30 or lower support at $18.25. Polkadot (DOT) Holds Firm at $4.8—Is a Breakout to $6.2 Next? Polkadot (DOT) is showing resilience amid market volatility, holding steady above the $4.8 support level. While other altcoins struggle with uncertainty, DOT’s stability suggests strong buying interest, preventing a deeper price drop. Despite trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), DOT is attempting to push toward $6.2 resistance. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering near the 50% mark, indicating a potential shift in momentum. If RSI moves above this level, buying pressure could increase, leading to further gains. If DOT breaks $6.2, it could target $7.7 and $9.8, with a potential move toward $11.9 if bullish momentum strengthens. However, losing $4.8 support could see DOT retreat to $3.5 or even $1.9. Web3Bay: The Hottest Crypto Presale of February—Don’t Miss Out! Web3Bay is taking the crypto market by storm, rapidly advancing through its presale batches as demand surges. In just a few weeks, the project has raised over $1.50 million, with more than 360 million tokens sold. This lightning-fast progression signals strong investor confidence, and with each new batch, prices continue to rise—meaning early adopters are already locking in massive gains before the token even hits exchanges. What makes Web3Bay stand out? Unlike speculative tokens, Web3Bay is built for real-world utility, revolutionizing e-commerce with a decentralized marketplace that cuts out middlemen, lowers fees, and allows for direct peer-to-peer transactions. The project supports crypto and fiat payments, including PayPal, ensuring broad accessibility. Plus, staking rewards and DAO governance give holders long-term incentives beyond just trading. With batch prices increasing steadily, Web3Bay is shaping up to be one of the most lucrative presales of 2025. Early investors buying at $0.00456 per token are eyeing an expected launch price of $0.1959, positioning them for over 4,000% gains. The window to get in early is closing fast, and once Web3Bay hits the market, demand is expected to skyrocket. Next 100x Crypto Opportunities While Hyperliquid (HYPE) and Polkadot (DOT) offer traders potential gains, their paths remain tied to market fluctuations and resistance levels. HYPE needs to clear $30, and DOT must reclaim $6.2 for continued upside. Meanwhile, Web3Bay’s momentum isn’t tied to speculation—it’s being driven by real adoption and demand. As it disrupts the $5.7 trillion e-commerce market, Web3Bay is set to become more than just a token—it’s an entire ecosystem. With its rapidly increasing presale prices and limited token supply, early adopters have a once-in-a-cycle opportunity for 4,000%+ returns. The clock is ticking, and when Web3Bay hits exchanges, the opportunity to buy at these prices will be gone. HYPE and DOT might rise, but 3BAY is leading the next wave of crypto adoption—don’t miss it.

40564351,https://timestabloid.com/?p=57871,1740013238,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"PropiChain is the Best Altcoin to Buy Along with Dogecoin in 2025, Experts Claims",https://timestabloid.com/propichain-is-the-best-altcoin-to-buy-along-with-dogecoin-in-2025/,"In a shocking twist of events, PropiChain (PCHAIN) has topped the shortlist of the best altcoin to buy alongside Dogecoin (DOGE). This comes after most cryptos failed to meet their market predictions for Q1 2025, prompting investors to think more strategically. Thankfully, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to blaze ahead, boosting its perception as a serious investment rather than a speculative one. However, alongside Dogecoin, experts point to PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a new token they believe will rake in massive profits in 2025. Dogecoin: Why DOGE is Up and Finding The Next Best Altcoin to Buy Dogecoin (DOGE) has faced bearish trends in recent weeks but has climbed over 5.97% over the past week. Currently trading at $0.2727 , Dogecoin is at its highest mark since February 3, when the coin recovered from a drastic dip to $0.224. This spike followed the SEC’s announcement that it has received an application to create a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) from Greyscale, a leading crypto asset manager. Greyscale’s intention to create Dogecoin ETF isn’t new, but the SEC’s formal approval will get the ball rolling on the review process. Much like the Bitcoin ETF approval helped push the coin to new heights, analysts predict that the Dogecoin price will respond favorably if the SEC grants approval, even potentially making DOGE the best altcoin to buy in 2025. But even more interesting is PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a new altcoin that’s set to surge alongside Dogecoin, even mirroring the iconic 2021 DOGE rally. Aside from PropiChain’s near-identical growth pattern to Dogecoin, investors are calling PCHAIN the best altcoin to buy now due to transformative blockchain solutions for the $634 trillion real estate industry. Why PropiChain is the Best Altcoin to Buy in 2025? PropiChain (PCHAIN) is positioning itself as the next wave of innovation in a real estate market valued at roughly $634 trillion. Powered by its native PCHAIN AI altcoin, the platform merges artificial intelligence, RWA tokenization, metaverse integration, and smart contracts to streamline every aspect of property transactions. The surge in global AI investments has brought increased attention to PropiChain, which offers a suite of AI-driven features for PCHAIN holders . Personalized property searches, precise appraisals, advanced market analytics, automated trading, and round-the-clock virtual support are all part of its robust toolset. AI capabilities within the metaverse marketplace allow users to pinpoint promising properties quickly, aided by sophisticated filters that assess factors like investment potential, neighborhood trends, and historical performance. This level of detail provides an advantage in a competitive landscape, reinforced by Automated Valuation Models (AVMs) that deliver unbiased, data-backed assessments. By mapping future market fluctuations, these models help investors optimize decision-making without second-guessing. The platform’s automatic trading functionality further refines the investment experience by letting users set buy or sell targets in advance. Once those thresholds are met, trades execute instantly, capturing opportunities even when investors are away from their screens. Beyond AI, the broader PropiChain ecosystem opens the door to fractional ownership through tokenized real estate, making premium properties accessible to a wider audience. An immersive metaverse marketplace brings a global dimension to property transactions, while smart contracts simplify renting processes by automating leasing, rent collection, and renewals. This fusion of AI, tokenization, and smart contracts positions PropiChain at the leading edge of digital real estate. With projections that place PCHAIN’s growth on par with high-profile crypto rallies, analysts are notably bullish, calling PropiChain the best altcoin to buy now ahead of the coming bull run. PropiChain BlockAudit and Exchange Listings Security remains one of the top priorities in the cryptocurrency world, and PropiChain has made it clear that protecting users is a central goal. By securing a certified audit from BlockAudit (a trusted name in blockchain security), the project demonstrates a strong commitment to safeguarding its smart contracts against potential exploits or weaknesses. This verification boosts investor confidence, showing that PCHAIN’s infrastructure is robust and prepared for real-world use. Beyond its security achievements, PropiChain also benefits from being listed on CoinMarketCap . This inclusion places the project in front of a global audience of crypto enthusiasts and potential investors. Although PropiChain hasn’t yet reached major CEXs, industry observers believe such a listing could trigger a rapid and significant price increase, offering further incentive for those watching the project’s development. PCHAIN Presale Selling the Best Altcoin to Buy in 2025 for $0.011 PropiChain is currently in Stage 2 of the PCHAIN presale at just $0.011 per token, and the upcoming Stage 3 price of $0.023 suggests an easy doubling of value, even before the token appears on major exchanges. Yet the real excitement lies in a projected $3.56 target, implying a remarkable 32,400% climb from today’s price. The math is compelling: an initial $700 could grow to $226,800 if the token reaches $3.56, making PCHAIN potentially the best altcoin to buy in early 2025. Although Dogecoin (DOGE) still attracts attention and may advance toward the $1 mark, such a move would rely on a widespread crypto market rally. PropiChain (PCHAIN) , on the other hand, demonstrates tangible utility, AI-driven technology, and a clear advantage as an emerging project. Furthermore, PCHAIN operates in a massive real-estate sector, aiming to provide solutions with genuine value. Dogecoin remains well-known, but its growth prospects are constrained by limited innovation. Even if it does hit $1, the increase from its current levels would be around 400%, which is incomparable to PropiChain. With its Stage 2 presale pricing still at $0.011 and Stage 3 set to jump to $0.023, the 324x profit potential will be cut by more than half, making now the ideal time to acquire what could be the best altcoin to buy in 2025.

President Donald Trump His comments came as Bitcoin traded just shy of $96,700 on Wednesday evening, having hit an all-time high of more than $108,000 earlier this year. Trump positions the US as a global crypto leader In his presidential campaign and since his election to office, Trump has portrayed himself as a pro-digital assets sort of guy. Before being elected last year, he vowed to make the US “the crypto capital of the planet.” Since his inauguration, he’s made strides to support the industry, like appointing former regulator Paul Atkins, whom the crypto industry celebrated as a crypto-friendly agency head, to lead the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Trump also touted Miami’s position in the cryptocurrency space, calling it the “center of the action” and hinting that it could stay the heartbeat of digital asset activity. Trump noted that his administration is committed to leading America at the forefront of everything, and one of those is crypto. Trump has signed executive orders while in office to encourage the development of digital assets. In January, he signed an order that he called “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology” that formed a working group to create a federal regulatory framework for crypto. The order also aimed to prohibit a central bank digital currency (CBDC), a move supported broadly by the crypto community. Trump has criticized the SEC’s regulatory stance under former Chair Gary Gensler. The agency, which took numerous enforcement actions against crypto firms during Gensler’s tenure, had long been viewed as an antagonist to the industry. Trump claimed Wednesday that he had “totally ended that war.” Trump noted that the regulatory watchdog was really hostile to Bitcoin and crypto up until the very end. However, he noted that just before the end, they suddenly realized there were so many people on Bitcoin and crypto that they started being very nice. Trump champions crypto boom as Washington gears up for pro-digital asset legislation Trump’s comments arrived at a moment when Washington is expected to welcome its most pro-crypto Congress yet. Key lawmakers, including Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott and House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill, are leading efforts to draft regulatory frameworks for the industry. Alongside policy-oriented moves, Trump has also taken personal ownership of the crypto movement. In fact, before he even took office, he launched the TRUMP meme coin, which ballooned to billions of dollars in market capitalization. His wife, Melania Trump, soon joined him with her own cryptocurrency venture. Trump’s leadership, in particular, could further strengthen the US’s position as a dominant player in the world’s crypto economy, especially with a growing political push for adopting digital assets and a favorable regulatory environment.

Take Binance Coin (BNB), for example. When it first launched in 2017, its initial price was just $0.10 per token. Fast forward to today, and BNB has surged to over $500, making early investors millions. Those who hesitated in Binance Coin’s early days now look back with regret.

Enter Arctic Pablo Coin, the top crypto coin that’s making waves in the market with an innovative presale model and a unique growth strategy.

While some skeptics doubted its potential, early adopters saw the vision behind Binance’s ecosystem. As the Binance exchange expanded, so did the utility of BNB, driving its price up. By 2021, Binance Coin reached an all-time high of $690. Imagine investing $1,000 in BNB’s ICO—you’d now have millions. Unfortunately, many missed this golden opportunity, dismissing it as just another token. The key takeaway? Spotting potential early and seizing the moment can be life-changing in the crypto space.

The Blockchain Association also pointed out in a letter to the leaders of both houses and parties that the IRS rule extends the definition of a “broker” to mean software through which users interact with DeFi protocols. The group also noted that the current change could put too much pressure on developers working on DeFi systems. That rule affects software companies that do not have possession of personal property by requiring them to gather and disclose personal identifying data and transaction details. The Blockchain Association explained that compliance would change the DeFi software dramatically and even necessitate some middlemen for reports. According to Kristin Smith, the CEO of the Blockchain Association, the group has already embarked on a legal battle regarding the rule. However, she said that getting Congress to repeal it would take a shorter time compared to any other course of action. Impact on U.S. DeFi innovation The Blockchain Association also argued that allowing the rule to proceed would be detrimental to the United States’ dominance in DeFi and financial technology. The letter clarified that the regulation solely targets domestic DeFi firms, while international companies providing the same services to U.S. consumers are not affected. The group explained that this imbalance may slow down domestic innovation, though it may push some projects offshore. “Second, the rule raises privacy and surveillance concerns. It requires DeFi industry participants to collect and store users’ personal identifying information, and to report transaction details to the IRS. This is a dramatic infringement that disincentivizes innovation.” The Blockchain Association Ron Hammond, the senior director of government relations of the association was optimistic that the rule would be repealed across the parties. He cited similar sentiments in 2021 when issues to do with regulation of decentralized finance, DeFi, held up the infrastructure bill. Hammond criticized what he described as overregulation by the Biden administration and asserted the industry is not in the phase of learning anymore. He underscored the need for policy and regulation that promote innovation but effectively shield consumers. He also noted that DeFi is gaining support from the finance and banking authorities, explaining that sentiments are changing as Trump has vowed to make America the leader in cryptocurrency. Other crypto organizations have also expressed a lot of concern about the IRS rule. The DeFi Education Fund hailed the growing trend as a response to what it termed as unworkable and unconstitutional regulation.

This marks a key step in the bloc’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation. However, the absence of Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, has raised concerns about regulatory priorities and the potential consequences for the digital asset market. Tether Misses Out as EU Grants MiCA Approval to 10 Stablecoin Providers The largest stablecoin issuer, Tether, was noticeably absent from the list of ten firms authorized under MiCA regulations to issue stablecoins in the EU. The approved entities include Banking Circle, Circle, Crypto.Com, Fiat Republic, Membrane Finance, Quantoz Payments, Schuman Financial, Societe Generale, StabIR, and Stable Mint. These firms have issued ten euro-pegged stablecoins and five US dollar-pegged stablecoins. Despite Tether’s $141 billion market capitalization, the company did not receive approval, which means crypto platforms have begun delisting USDT for EU-based users. Alongside stablecoin issuers, 11 MiCA-authorized Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) were approved across Germany, the Netherlands, and Malta. These providers offer services in trading, exchange, execution, custody, and transfers within the EU regulatory framework. Expanding Operations Beyond the EU With growing regulatory restrictions in the EU, Tether has continued to expand its operations in other regions. The stablecoin issuer recently proposed to acquire a 51% stake in a South African energy company, signaling a shift in focus toward investments outside of digital assets. Tether’s exclusion from MiCA-approved stablecoin issuers raises questions about the EU’s regulatory approach. The company expressed disappointment over the decision, stating that the delistings were “hasty and unwarranted.” However, MiCA’s rules require stablecoin issuers to meet specific compliance standards. Similarly, Tether has expanded into the sports industry, recently investing in Juventus to strengthen its presence in mainstream sectors. This move aligns with its broader strategy of integrating digital assets, AI, and biotech into traditional industries. MiCA Rules To Isolate the EU Crypto? Industry experts caution that the strict regulations under MiCA could isolate the EU’s digital asset market. Natalia Łątka, Director of Public Policy and Regulatory Affairs at Merkle Science, suggested that the EU’s regulatory stance may discourage foreign firms from operating in the region. She also noted that local crypto companies could consider relocating outside the EU to avoid restrictions associated with MiCA compliance. Additionally, some analysts argue that the EU’s regulatory focus on compliance over innovation could reduce market competitiveness. While MiCA aims to provide clarity and stability, critics believe it may lead to fewer options for European crypto users. This pushes firms toward jurisdictions with more flexible regulations.

Meet Mutuum Finance (MUTM),https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-this-cheap-altcoin-be-the-next-cardano-ada-meet-mutuum-finance-mutm/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently racing through the opening phase of its presale, raising over $774,320 and attracting 1,320 holders in a matter of days. With more than 70% of Phase 1 tokens already sold at $0.01 each, investors are scrambling to secure their stakes in a project analysts are calling a potential rival to Cardano (ADA). Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines decentralized lending solutions, an overcollateralized stablecoin, and a price-stabilizing buyback system, features positioning it for a 600% surge to $0.06 at launch. Experts further predict a staggering 100x climb to $1 in 2025, making this presale a rare chance to enter a high-growth DeFi ecosystem at ground level. Mutuum Finance Redefining Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another token; it’s a functional platform addressing real gaps in decentralized finance. The protocol enables users to lend or borrow digital assets through two models: peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P). Lenders deposit assets like USDT into liquidity pools, earning adjustable interest rates tied to borrowing demand. Borrowers, meanwhile, leverage crypto collateral to access liquidity while retaining ownership, a feature appealing to long-term investors avoiding forced asset sales. The P2C model relies on audited smart contracts for security, while P2P transactions let users negotiate terms directly. Both systems prioritize flexibility, transparency, and reduced risk, setting Mutuum Finance apart in a crowded market. By Phase 4, the platform plans a full launch, integrating an overcollateralized stablecoin backed by on-chain reserves. This addition will streamline borrowing processes and enhance price stability, further boosting MUTM’s utility-driven demand. Presale Momentum Builds Ahead of Beta Launch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capitalizing on its early momentum, with Phase 1 selling out rapidly and subsequent stages set to incrementally raise the token price to $0.06. Investors buying now could lock in a 6x return by launch day, a figure grounded in the project’s structured presale model, not speculative hype. The team has also announced a $100,000 giveaway for early participants, incentivizing community growth ahead of its exchange debut. Adding to the urgency, Mutuum Finance plans to release a beta version of its lending platform alongside the token launch. This operational product will immediately drive user adoption, transaction volume, and liquidity, critical factors for sustaining MUTM’s post-launch growth. Unlike projects reliant on vague roadmaps, Mutuum Finance delivers tangible utility from day one, a key reason analysts are bullish on its $1 target in 2025. Why MUTM Outshines Cardano (ADA) in Utility While Cardano (ADA) has cemented itself as a blockchain pioneer, its focus on scalability and smart contracts lacks the immediate financial incentives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers. MUTM’s lending protocols and stablecoin integration create direct revenue streams for users, blending passive income with capital appreciation. Additionally, the buy-and-distribute mechanism allocates a portion of platform fees to purchase MUTM from the market, redistributing tokens to stakers. This built-in demand driver ensures continuous buying pressure, a feature absent in most Layer 1 tokens like ADA. The presale’s tiered pricing structure further advantages early adopters. With Phase 1 nearly exhausted, entry prices will rise in subsequent stages, rewarding those who act swiftly. A $1,500 investment today could balloon to $10,500 at launch and potentially $150,000 if MUTM hits $1 in 2025, a trajectory supported by its deflationary tokenomics and expanding user base. As the crypto market develops, projects offering real-world utility and structured growth are dominating. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) checks every box: a low presale price, explosive short-term gains, and a long-term vision anchored in DeFi’s expanding role. With Phase 1 slots dwindling, the window for securing tokens at $0.01 is closing fast. The question isn’t whether Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could follow Cardano’s (ADA) success, it’s whether investors will recognize this opportunity before the presale concludes. Those who act now position themselves for a 600% return at launch and a potential 100x surge in 2025.

Earlier this year, ADA surged past $1.15, but by February, it tumbled to $0.68; a 40% drop. The recent 15% rebound has helped recover some losses, but technical indicators suggest that growth may be stalling. A closer look at Cardano price charts reveals a descending triangle formation, often signaling a potential breakdown rather than a bullish recovery. If Cardano price remains trapped under key resistance, it could dip back to $0.72, with further selling potentially pushing it to $0.66. However, if buying pressure strengthens, ADA could reclaim $0.90 and eventually challenge the $1 mark again. While ADA stabilizes, investors are looking elsewhere for high-growth opportunities, and one project catching attention is RCO Finance . Unlike ADA, which has already established itself and slowed down, RCOF is in its early stages; meaning its upside potential is massive. This AI Crypto Is Built for Smarter Investing and Bigger Profit Crypto investors are always on the lookout for ways to maximize profits, and RCO Finance delivers exactly that with its game-changing AI-powered Robo Advisor. Unlike traditional investments where you need to constantly analyze charts, follow news, and time your trades, RCOF does all the heavy lifting for you. The Robo Advisor scans the market in real time, gathering data from sources like Bloomberg and Reuters to pinpoint optimal entry and exit points. This means you no longer need to guess when to buy or sell. For example, the PEPE token surged over 10,000% just a few days after it launched but most people got in after that surge. The Robo Advisor would have identified patterns and alerted you to it before that surge. But it’s not just about spotting winners; it also detects downturns, helping you exit before prices crash. And the Robo Advisor continuously adapts to market trends and your personal investment style, optimizing your portfolio for better performance. Whether you’re a conservative investor looking for steady growth or an aggressive trader chasing big gains, the AI fixes strategies to fit your goals. Beyond AI, RCO Finance offers features that traditional crypto platforms simply don’t. Investors can diversify into over 120,000 assets, including bonds, ETFs, and tokenized real estate, all within a single ecosystem. Also, RCOF’s debit card lets you spend your crypto holdings seamlessly. And best of all, the platform is completely KYC-free, meaning you can trade, invest, and spend without invasive verification processes. Presale Gains and Future Growth Make RCOF the Top Bet for 2025 RCO Finance is already proving its value with a fully operational Beta Platform . Unlike most crypto projects that launch without a working product, RCOF has over 10,000 active users testing its features. The team is now refining its Alpha version, which will introduce even more powerful AI enhancements. The presale is currently in its 5th stage, with tokens selling at $0.10. But time is running out; once the next stage kicks in, the price jumps to $0.13, an instant 30% gain. With over $13 million raised so far, momentum is building fast, and early buyers are locking in their positions before RCOF gets listed on major exchanges. Let’s put this into perspective. A $1,000 investment at this stage grows to $1,300 when the next stage launches. But that’s just the beginning. Once RCOF hits major listings and demand skyrockets, we’re looking at potential 10,000x gains. That same $1,000 could turn into $100,000 if RCOF follows the trajectory of past crypto success stories. SolidProof, a top blockchain auditing firm, has verified that RCOF is fully secure with no vulnerabilities, so you can invest without worries. ADA’s Slow Growth vs. RCOF’s Rapid Momentum, Which One Wins? While ADA remains a solid choice for long-term holders, its growth has slowed dramatically. Even if the Cardano price reaches $1.50, that’s only a 2x return. Compare that to RCOF , a brand-new project with faster adoption, stronger real-world utility, and a rapidly expanding presale. Investors who got in early have already seen gains, and those who wait risk missing out. The next presale stage alone increases the price by 30%, and by the time it lists, early adopters could be sitting on life-changing returns. The window of opportunity is closing fast, and delaying just a few weeks could mean watching RCOF skyrocket from the sidelines instead of profiting from its rise. If Cardano price is moving at a slow pace, RCOF is speeding toward massive success; making now the best time to jump in.

Web3Bay is rewriting the rules of decentralized commerce, rapidly advancing through its presale while offering real utility and 6,000% return potential. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) is positioned for a breakout to $260, with bullish technical indicators pointing to a strong rally. Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, is at a crossroads, struggling to hold $2,500 as market sentiment wavers. ‘ For investors, this isn’t just another price cycle—it’s a chance to position early before the biggest gains materialize. Web3Bay’s record-breaking presale momentum proves that smart money is already moving. Will you act before the window closes, or will you be left watching from the sidelines? Solana (SOL) Gears Up for a Potential Surge to $260—Can It Hold Key Support? Solana (SOL) is showing signs of strength as it trades within a well-defined parallel channel. Analysts suggest a possible breakout, with price targets between $225 and $260, provided it maintains key support at $190. Technical indicators favor an upward move. The MACD has turned bullish, hinting at growing momentum, while Fibonacci retracement points to $225 as a critical pivot for further gains. If SOL stays above support, it could rally toward these targets. Market sentiment leans bullish, with long positions outweighing shorts and open interest rising, signaling investor confidence. A surge in futures activity suggests traders are positioning for a breakout. Ethereum (ETH) Teeters Near $2,500—Can It Avoid a Bigger Drop? Ethereum’s price has struggled to regain momentum after repeated rejections at $4,000 in December. Currently trading below the 200-day moving average at $3,000, ETH is testing resistance near $2,700. A successful breakout could signal a bullish reversal, but failure may push ETH toward $2,350 or even $2,000. On the 4-hour chart, Ethereum is consolidating, with RSI nearing 50%, hinting at weakening momentum. A drop below this threshold could trigger further selling pressure. Investors should watch $2,700 closely—a decisive move above it could change the trend, while rejection may lead to deeper losses. Can Ethereum hold firm, or is a bigger drop inevitable? Web3Bay: The Next Amazon of Crypto—A Rare 6,000% Opportunity Imagine investing in Amazon in its early days—before it became the e-commerce giant it is today. Those who saw its potential and got in early made life-changing returns. Web3Bay is following a similar trajectory, bringing decentralized commerce to the blockchain while eliminating high fees and middlemen. As a Web3-powered marketplace, it allows users to buy and sell goods seamlessly using crypto and fiat, including PayPal, making it one of the most practical and scalable blockchain projects today. The presale is moving at lightning speed—$1.50 million raised and 360 million tokens sold in just weeks. Each batch sells out fast, with prices increasing at every stage. Investors buying now at $0.00456 per token are looking at a projected launch price of $0.1959, meaning 6,000% potential gains post-listing. Opportunities like this don’t come often—early movers are locking in exponential profits before Web3Bay goes mainstream. Will you? One Clear Winner—The Time to Move Is Now While Solana’s bullish momentum and Ethereum’s uncertain future keep traders guessing, Web3Bay is delivering real, measurable success. Its presale has already raised $1.50 million, with 360 million tokens sold in weeks, and prices rising at every batch. Early investors at $0.00456 are securing 6,000% returns post-listing, a rare opportunity before the token hits major exchanges. Solana may reach $260, and Ethereum could recover, but Web3Bay isn’t just another speculative asset—it’s a true disruptor in blockchain commerce. The presale is selling out fast, and history shows that early movers in high-utility projects see the biggest returns. The choice is clear—position now or risk missing one of the biggest crypto investment opportunities of 2025. Will you seize it or sit back and watch?

Although still shy of the coveted $100,000 mark, the leading cryptocurrency shows signs of resilience. This recovery is unfolding against the backdrop of mixed market signals, prompting analysts to weigh the potential for continued bullish momentum versus the risk of a near-term pullback. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Persistent Resistance at $100K, Analyst Eyes Next Step Bitcoin’s Market Momentum at a Crossroads One recent analysis from Onchain Edge, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, highlights Bitcoin’s current “critical decision zone.” Using two key indicators—the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio and the MVRV Ratio—Onchain Edge’s findings suggest a market that is not yet overvalued, though caution flags remain. While the overall on-chain data leans more positive, the contrasting signals highlight the precarious position of Bitcoin’s current rally. From a bullish perspective, the MVRV Ratio—an indicator that compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value—stands at 2.21, well below the levels that typically signal market tops (3.5–4.0). This suggests that Bitcoin’s current valuation is not overstretched, leaving room for further upside. Moreover, other indicators such as the Puell Multiple reinforce the notion that Bitcoin has not yet reached overbought conditions. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, if these macro indicators hold steady and buyers return in force, Bitcoin could continue its upward trajectory, potentially reclaiming six-figure territory before any substantial correction sets in. Possible Bearish Signals on the Horizon Despite these promising signs, the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, which gauges market sentiment by comparing aggressive buy and sell orders, stands at 0.96—below the 0.98 threshold often associated with bullish strength. Onchain Edge reveals that historically, levels around this range have preceded market corrections, as was the case during peaks in March and November of 2021. Should Bitcoin fail to break above resistance, this ratio could hint at a short-term top. A sustained failure to climb past current levels may trigger a temporary pullback, providing a cooling-off period before any subsequent rally. As Bitcoin hovers near this pivotal price point, the market remains finely balanced between cautious optimism and potential downside risk. Onchain Edge concludes that maintaining a level above $95,000, combined with a resurgence in buying activity, could pave the way for a move to new highs.

While the bull cycle appears intact, the coming days may determine whether Bitcoin’s current rally has enough fuel to continue, or if a pause is on the horizon.

33767162,[object Object],1740018617,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Bitcoin 9-Month Cycle Says It’s Not Over, Analyst Shows Where We Are In The Bull Run",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-9-month-cycle/,"The Bitcoin price action is currently following a pattern seen in previous bull runs, suggesting that its 9-month cycle may not be over yet. According to a crypto analyst, historical data from past Bitcoin cycles shows precisely where the market is in the current bull run . These past trends reveal that the market may be caught in a bear trap. What Bitcoin Past Cycles Say About The Market’s Current Position Crypto analyst Cyclop on X (formerly Twitter) shared historical data of past Bitcoin bull run cycles to determine the exact position of the current market. The analyst revealed that during the bull rally in 2011, 2013, 2017, and 2021, Bitcoin experienced a recurring nine-month bull market, with a bear trap phase occurring around month 5 or 6. A bear trap is a temporary price decline that misleads traders and investors into believing that the bull market is over , triggering a massive sell-off and spreading fear. Unlike the normal bear market, which involves prolonged periods of decline and volatility, a bear trap swiftly recovers and continues on its former bullish momentum. According to the Cyclops chart, the Bitcoin market has likely entered its bear trap phase, aligning with patterns from previous bull run cycles . In 2011, Bitcoin saw a nine-month bull run, with a bear trap occurring in the sixth month. The only exception to this six-month trend was in 2013 when the bear trap emerged in the fifth month instead. If Bitcoin’s market were to follow this historical data, as the analyst suggests, then it would mean that the cryptocurrency has possibly entered the 6-month bear trap. This trend is typically followed by stages of renewed optimism, Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO), and Euphoria at the peak before the next market correction. Currently, the Bitcoin price has declined significantly below the $100,000 threshold and is now trading at $95,767. Based on CoinMarketCap’s reports, the pioneer cryptocurrency declined by over 11% in the past month and has failed to recover enough gains to push it back to previous highs. Factors like US President Donald Trump’s tariffs , ongoing market volatility and changes in sentiment have had a severe impact on the Bitcoin market and broader cryptocurrencies. Crypto Community Reacts With Mixed Views While Cyclop believes that the current market has possibly entered a bear trap, crypto community members argue that it is still in a bull run. One member, B. Rich disclosed that rather than a bear trap, the market was likely experiencing a shakeout. He predicts that the bear trap would come into play when the Bitcoin price hits or pulls back around the $200,000 level due to various psychological reasons. He also believes that a long-term super cycle may be in the books super cycle may be in the books for BTC, with current bearish sentiment quickly transforming into FOMO.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Coinmarketcap|Cyclop|Donald Trump|fomo,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-20 02:30:17

BTC is rising within a range and might revisit the $98,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin started a decent recovery wave above the $95,500 zone. The price is trading above $96,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $96,700 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $96,000 zone. Bitcoin Price Recover Losses Bitcoin price formed a base above the $93,500 level and started a recovery wave . BTC was able to surpass the $94,000 and $94,200 resistance levels. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $98,825 swing high to the $93,288 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $96,700 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair even surpassed the $96,500 level and now faces hurdles near the $96,800 zone. Bitcoin price is now trading above $96,200 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $96,800 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $98,825 swing high to the $93,288 low. The first key resistance is near the $97,200 level. The next key resistance could be $98,000. A close above the $98,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $98,800 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $99,500 level or even $100,000. Another Decline In BTC?

But is going public the golden ticket to mainstream acceptance? Let’s dive into the insights shared by Belshe and explore what this could mean for the future of crypto finance . Why Crypto IPOs Are Key to Wall Street Trust Belshe’s core argument revolves around a simple yet profound concept: transparency breeds trust . In the traditional financial world, going public is a rite of passage, a demonstration of maturity and accountability. For crypto companies, often perceived as opaque and risky by traditional investors, an IPO could be the bridge to credibility. Here’s a breakdown of why: Enhanced Investor Confidence: Public companies are subject to rigorous financial reporting and audits. This level of scrutiny provides a safety net for investors, assuring them that the company’s operations are legitimate and financially sound. For Wall Street, accustomed to these standards, this is non-negotiable. Demonstrated Commitment to Transparency: IPOs mandate a level of openness that private crypto firms often lack. From detailed financial disclosures to regular shareholder updates, going public forces companies to operate under a spotlight, fostering trust through visibility. Access to Broader Capital: Public markets unlock access to significantly larger pools of capital compared to private funding rounds. This influx of investment can fuel growth, innovation, and expansion for crypto firms, propelling the entire industry forward. Navigating the Complex Landscape of SEC Crypto Policy The regulatory environment, particularly the stance of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , is a critical factor in the future of crypto finance . Belshe’s optimistic outlook is partly fueled by pro-crypto appointments within both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). But what does this mean in practice? While policy shifts are notoriously slow, these appointments signal a potential shift in regulatory sentiment. It suggests a move towards a more informed and perhaps more accommodating approach to cryptocurrency regulation. However, challenges remain: Challenge Potential Impact on Crypto IPOs Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear and consistent regulations across jurisdictions remains a significant hurdle. May deter some crypto firms from pursuing IPOs due to compliance complexities and potential legal risks. SEC Scrutiny: Even with pro-crypto appointments, the SEC’s primary mandate is investor protection. Crypto firms will face intense scrutiny during the IPO process. Demands rigorous preparation and adherence to stringent disclosure requirements for crypto companies aiming to go public. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of the crypto market can make it challenging for newly public crypto firms to maintain investor confidence and stock price stability. Requires robust risk management strategies and clear communication of long-term vision to investors. The Republican Influence and Potential Policy Overhaul Belshe highlighted the Republican control of both the U.S. House and Senate as a factor that could accelerate regulatory reforms. This political landscape presents a unique opportunity for the crypto industry. But how significant is this influence on SEC crypto policy ? With Republicans often advocating for less regulation and greater economic freedom, there’s a perceived alignment with the crypto industry’s desire for clearer and more favorable regulatory frameworks. This could translate into: Faster Legislative Action: Republican control might streamline the legislative process for crypto-related bills, potentially leading to quicker implementation of new policies. Pro-Business Regulatory Environment: A Republican-led Congress could favor regulations that foster innovation and growth within the crypto sector, potentially easing the path for crypto IPOs . Increased Dialogue and Collaboration: The political climate might encourage more open dialogue between regulators and the crypto industry, leading to more balanced and effective policies. Institutional Crypto Investment: The Next Frontier The push for crypto IPOs is intrinsically linked to the broader trend of institutional crypto investment . Wall Street’s trust isn’t just about individual investors; it’s about attracting the big players – institutional investors like pension funds, hedge funds, and asset managers. Why is their involvement so crucial? Massive Capital Inflow: Institutional investors manage trillions of dollars. Even a small allocation to crypto assets from these institutions would represent a monumental influx of capital into the market. Increased Market Stability: Institutional investment tends to be longer-term and more strategic, which can help to reduce market volatility and create a more stable foundation for growth. Mainstream Legitimacy: When established financial institutions invest in crypto, it sends a powerful signal of legitimacy to the broader public, accelerating mainstream adoption. Looking Ahead: The Transformative Future of Crypto Finance Mike Belshe’s perspective underscores a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. The journey towards widespread Wall Street crypto adoption may well hinge on the willingness of crypto firms to embrace the rigor and transparency of public markets through crypto IPOs . This isn’t just about raising capital; it’s about building trust, fostering legitimacy, and paving the way for the future of crypto finance . While regulatory hurdles and market volatility remain, the potential rewards are immense. As the political and regulatory landscape evolves, and as institutional interest in crypto continues to grow, the path to going public may become increasingly attractive – and perhaps even essential – for crypto firms seeking to solidify their place in the global financial ecosystem.

40567106,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131048,1740020610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Exclusive Reveal: WLFI Co-founder Unveils Bold DeFi Strategy, Shunning Venture Capital",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/wlfi-defi-venture-capital-strategy/,"In a fascinating turn of events at Consensus Hong Kong 2025, Zak Folkman, the co-founder of the buzzworthy DeFi project World Liberty Financial (WLFI), dropped a bombshell. Forget the usual route of chasing big bucks from venture capital firms. WLFI, it seems, charted a different course entirely. Folkman openly stated that WLFI’s token sale was deliberately designed as a powerful marketing engine, aimed squarely at building rock-solid crypto community ties. Intriguing, right? Let’s dive into what this means for WLFI and the wider world of decentralized finance. Why No Venture Capital for This DeFi Project? So, why did WLFI, a promising DeFi project , decide to sidestep the traditional venture capital funding route? According to Odaily’s report from Consensus Hong Kong, Folkman clarified that securing VC backing wasn’t on their agenda. Instead, the focus was laser-sharp on community engagement right from the get-go. This is a rather unconventional approach in the crypto space, where many projects heavily rely on venture capital injections to kickstart development and marketing efforts. Think about it. Venture capital firms often bring not just funds but also networks, expertise, and a certain level of prestige. However, they also come with expectations – and often, a significant stake in the project’s governance and future profits. WLFI’s decision suggests a desire for greater autonomy and a stronger emphasis on decentralized governance driven by its crypto community . The Token Sale: A Marketing Masterstroke? Folkman described the token sale not just as a fundraising event, but as a strategic marketing maneuver. This is a crucial distinction. Instead of solely aiming to amass capital, WLFI used the token sale to: Generate Buzz: A well-executed token sale naturally creates excitement and media attention around a project. Build a Community: By directly involving early adopters in the project’s financial ecosystem, WLFI fostered a sense of ownership and shared purpose. Decentralize Token Distribution: A public token sale, in theory, leads to a more distributed token ownership compared to private VC rounds, aligning with the ethos of decentralization. This approach could be seen as a clever move to bootstrap a crypto community organically, rather than relying on top-down influence from venture capitalists. It’s a bet on the power of grassroots support and decentralized participation. Addressing Investor Concerns and Celebrating Milestones Folkman acknowledged that the initial phases weren’t without their hurdles. Retail investors, known for their sharp eyes and even sharper questions, raised concerns about WLFI’s valuation and ambitious fundraising goals. Selling roughly 24 billion WLFI token s at $0.05 each, raking in a cool $1.2 billion, is no small feat and naturally invited scrutiny. However, Folkman highlighted a significant positive – WLFI achieved its milestones ahead of schedule. This suggests that despite the unconventional funding route and initial skepticism, the project is delivering on its promises and building momentum. Hitting milestones early is a powerful signal to the crypto community and can significantly boost confidence and long-term prospects. WLFI Token: Utility and Governance So, what exactly is the WLFI token and what does it do? Folkman clarified that it serves a dual purpose: Governance: Holding WLFI tokens likely grants users voting rights within the WLFI ecosystem, allowing the crypto community to participate in key decisions about the project’s future. Utility: Beyond governance, the WLFI token has practical applications within the WLFI platform. While specific utilities weren’t detailed in this report, utility could encompass access to premium features, reduced transaction fees, staking rewards, or participation in specific DeFi mechanisms within the WLFI ecosystem. The combination of governance and utility is crucial for the long-term health and value accrual of any crypto token. It ensures that token holders are not just passive investors but active participants in the project’s growth and direction. Navigating Unofficial Information and Future Trading With trading options, including swaps, not yet live for the WLFI token , Folkman issued a clear warning: steer clear of unofficial sources. In the often-wild west of crypto, misinformation and scams are rampant. Relying on verified channels for updates and information is paramount, especially during the early stages of a project. The absence of current trading options also implies that the WLFI token is still in its early distribution phase. The eventual launch of trading and swap functionalities will be a significant event, likely to influence price discovery and broader market participation. Is Shunning Venture Capital a New Trend in DeFi? WLFI’s approach begs the question: are we seeing a shift away from traditional venture capital reliance in the DeFi space? While VC funding remains a dominant force, projects like WLFI signal a potential trend towards community-centric models. Here’s a breakdown of the potential benefits and challenges of this approach: Benefits of Community-First, No Venture Capital Approach Challenges of Community-First, No Venture Capital Approach Greater autonomy and control for the project team. Stronger alignment with decentralized ethos. Potentially more loyal and engaged community. Reduced pressure for rapid, VC-driven growth at all costs. May lack the network and expertise VC firms provide. Potentially slower initial growth due to limited resources. Increased reliance on community marketing and organic growth. Higher risk if the token sale fails to generate sufficient capital or community interest. Ultimately, the success of WLFI’s strategy will be judged by its long-term performance and the vibrancy of its crypto community . However, their bold move to prioritize community over venture capital offers a fascinating case study in alternative funding models for DeFi project s. Conclusion: A Glimpse into DeFi’s Decentralized Future? WLFI’s story is more than just news; it’s a glimpse into the evolving landscape of DeFi and crypto funding. By consciously choosing to forgo venture capital and focus on community building through a strategic token sale , WLFI is challenging conventional wisdom and perhaps paving the way for a more decentralized and community-driven future in the crypto space. Their journey is one to watch closely, as it could redefine how DeFi project s are launched and sustained in the years to come. The crypto community is certainly taking note.

On Feb. 20, the SEC published a statement acknowledging receipt of the 21Shares’ Ethereum ( ETH ) ETF staking proposal following its review of the filing from Cboe BZX Exchange. If approved, this would be the first time an Ethereum ETF offers staking in the United States. By staking ETH, the plan seeks to enable the ETF to produce extra profits, which investors would then receive. The document states that all staked ether will be owned by the trust, setting it apart from models such as staking-as-a-service or delegated staking that have previously encountered regulatory opposition. The SEC has always had a stringent policy regarding proof-of-stake assets. The government categorized staking-related activities as securities under former Chair Gary Gensler, which led to many Ethereum ETF issuers removing staking from their registration statements. You might also like: XRP soars amid SEC’s latest move, meanwhile Yeti Ouro enters stage 3 But under the Trump administration, the SEC has adopted a more pro-crypto stance, creating a dedicated crypto task force and reconsidering the classification of some tokens as securities. A more transparent legal framework for staking, according to analysts, may encourage wider adoption, especially among institutions looking for more yield options in the digital asset market. The proposal coincides with an increase in institutional demand for Ethereum exchange-traded funds. According to recent 13F filings, ownership in ETH ETFs increased from 4.8% to 14.5% in Q4 2024, whilst ownership of Bitcoin ETFs decreased marginally from 22.3% to 21.5%. ETH ETF staking is also seen by many as a major catalyst that might boost the price of ETH. In a related development, the SEC’s recent acknowledgment of Bitwise, 21Shares, and Grayscale’s registrations for Ripple ( XRP ) spot ETFs sparked speculation about a broader adoption of crypto-based ETFs. Given the growing regulatory shifts, the next few months could be critical for Ethereum, XRP, and other digital assets seeking institutional adoption.

40567199,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131049,1740020778,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Watchdog Alert: Korean Regulator Intensifies Crypto Business Inspections in 2024,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/korean-regulator-crypto-inspections/,"Are you keeping a close eye on the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency regulations? In a significant move that’s sending ripples through the digital asset space, South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) is stepping up its game. Get ready for enhanced scrutiny as the FSS announces its 2024 inspection plan, with a laser focus on virtual asset service providers (VASPs). This isn’t just a routine check-up; it’s a determined effort to ensure crypto businesses in South Korea are playing by the rules – both written and unwritten. Why the Increased Scrutiny on Crypto Businesses? South Korea has emerged as a major hub for cryptocurrency trading and innovation. However, with rapid growth comes the need for robust oversight. The FSS’s decision to tighten inspections reflects a global trend towards greater regulation of the crypto sector, aiming to protect investors and maintain financial stability. But what’s driving this urgency? Here are a few key factors: Investor Protection: The primary goal is to safeguard investors from potential risks associated with the volatile crypto market, including fraud, market manipulation, and inadequate security measures. Combating Illicit Activities: Cryptocurrencies have been sometimes linked to illicit activities like money laundering and terrorist financing. Stricter regulations aim to curb these risks and ensure the integrity of the financial system. Ensuring Fair Market Practices: The FSS wants to ensure a level playing field for all participants in the crypto market. This includes monitoring for insider trading, unfair trading practices, and ensuring transparent operations of crypto businesses . Alignment with International Standards: Global regulatory bodies are increasingly focusing on crypto assets. South Korea’s enhanced oversight can be seen as an effort to align with international standards and best practices in regulating digital assets. What Will the Inspections Entail for VASPs? The FSS’s inspections are not just about ticking boxes. They are comprehensive evaluations to ensure VASPs are truly compliant. Here’s what virtual asset service providers can expect: Legal and Regulatory Adherence: The FSS will meticulously check if VASPs are adhering to all relevant laws and regulations, including the Act on Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Transaction Information. This includes proper registration, anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. Voluntary Compliance Rule Checks: Beyond legal requirements, the FSS will also assess adherence to voluntary compliance rules established by industry bodies and the platforms themselves. This signifies a move towards fostering a culture of self-regulation alongside mandatory rules. Operational Risk Assessment: Inspections will delve into the operational risks associated with VASPs, including cybersecurity measures, system stability, and business continuity plans. The goal is to ensure platforms are resilient and can withstand potential disruptions. Consumer Protection Measures: A critical aspect will be evaluating how VASPs protect their users. This includes examining measures for handling customer complaints, dispute resolution mechanisms, and the clarity and fairness of terms of service. Financial Stability Review: The FSS will likely assess the financial health of VASPs to ensure they are financially sound and can meet their obligations to customers. This might include reviewing capital adequacy and risk management frameworks. The Role of the Korean Regulator in Shaping Crypto Landscape The Korean regulator , the FSS, plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of the cryptocurrency landscape in South Korea. Its actions and policies have significant implications for both domestic and international crypto markets. Consider these points to understand the influence of the Korean regulator : Aspect Impact of Korean Regulator Market Stability Regulations aim to reduce volatility and prevent market manipulation, fostering a more stable trading environment. Investor Confidence Enhanced oversight can boost investor confidence by signaling a safer and more regulated market. Innovation and Growth While regulations can be perceived as restrictive, they can also foster sustainable growth by building trust and attracting institutional investment in the long run. Global Influence As a major crypto market, South Korea’s regulatory approach can influence global standards and policies. Compliance is Key for VASPs: Navigating the Inspection Landscape For VASPs operating in South Korea, compliance is not just a legal obligation; it’s crucial for long-term sustainability and success. Here’s what businesses should focus on to navigate the intensifying inspection landscape: Proactive Compliance Measures: Don’t wait for inspections to begin. Implement robust AML/KYC procedures, cybersecurity protocols, and customer protection measures proactively. Regular Audits and Reviews: Conduct regular internal audits and seek external reviews to identify and address any compliance gaps before the FSS comes knocking. Employee Training: Ensure all employees are well-trained on regulatory requirements and compliance procedures. A well-informed team is your first line of defense. Transparent Communication: Maintain open and transparent communication with the FSS and other regulatory bodies. A collaborative approach can be beneficial. Legal Counsel: Engage with legal experts specializing in cryptocurrency regulations to stay updated on the evolving legal landscape and ensure full compliance. Looking Ahead: What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? The FSS’s intensified inspections signal a maturing phase for the South Korean crypto market. While some may view stricter regulations as a hurdle, they are ultimately aimed at creating a more secure, transparent, and sustainable ecosystem. For investors and market participants, this means: Increased Security: Enhanced regulations should lead to greater security and protection for crypto investors. Greater Legitimacy: Stricter compliance can enhance the legitimacy of the crypto industry in the eyes of traditional financial institutions and the public. Potential Market Consolidation: The cost of compliance may lead to consolidation in the VASP market, with smaller players potentially merging or exiting. Long-Term Growth: A well-regulated market can attract more institutional investment and foster long-term, sustainable growth for the crypto sector in South Korea. In conclusion, the Korean regulator’s move to tighten inspections on crypto businesses is a significant development. It underscores the global trend towards greater oversight of the digital asset space and highlights South Korea’s commitment to fostering a responsible and secure crypto ecosystem. For VASPs , embracing compliance is not just about avoiding penalties; it’s about building trust, ensuring long-term viability, and contributing to the sustainable growth of the cryptocurrency industry.

40567317,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131064,1740020874,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Decoding BoJ’s Cautious Stance: Takata’s Silence on JGB Yields Sparks Market Speculation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/decoding-boj-takata-jgb-yields/,"In the ever-turbulent world of cryptocurrency and forex trading, every whisper from central bankers can trigger seismic shifts. Recently, Bank of Japan (BoJ) Board Member Hajime Takata’s remarks, or rather his deliberate lack of them, have sent ripples through the markets. Traders and analysts are keenly dissecting his statement – “won’t comment on Japanese government bond (JGB) yield levels” – trying to decipher the underlying message. What does this silence from a key BoJ official truly mean for the future of Japan’s monetary policy and the trajectory of the Yen, particularly against the US Dollar ( USD/JPY )? Let’s delve into the nuances of Takata’s comments and explore their potential impact. Why Takata’s Silence on JGB Yields Speaks Volumes When a central bank official, especially one as influential as BoJ’s Takata , chooses not to comment on a critical aspect like JGB yields , it’s often more telling than any explicit statement. Here’s a breakdown of what his silence, coupled with his other remarks, suggests: Market Sensitivity: Directly commenting on specific yield levels could be interpreted as market manipulation or forward guidance, something central banks generally avoid, especially after abandoning Yield Curve Control (YCC). Takata’s silence suggests a desire to let the market discover the equilibrium without direct BoJ influence. Acknowledging Market Forces: By stating that long-term interest rates are moving in line with Japan’s economy, Takata implicitly acknowledges the market’s role in price discovery. This is a departure from the YCC era where the BoJ actively controlled the yield curve. Vigilance over Volatility: While stepping back from direct yield control, Takata emphasizes the need to be vigilant against “any sharp rise in market volatility.” This hints at a balancing act – allowing market forces to operate while standing ready to intervene if volatility becomes excessive and disruptive. Navigating Japan’s Economic Landscape: Inflation and Interest Rates Takata’s broader comments provide further clues about the BoJ’s thinking. Let’s examine the key takeaways related to inflation and interest rates: Negative Real Interest Rates Persist: The acknowledgment that real interest rates remain negative indicates that despite recent policy adjustments, the BoJ is still in a relatively accommodative stance. This could be seen as a cautious approach, ensuring continued economic support. Inflation Focus Beyond Core: While the BoJ primarily focuses on core inflation (excluding fresh food), Takata highlights the awareness that rising fresh food costs can impact household inflation expectations. This suggests a holistic view of inflation, considering broader price pressures. Neutral Rate Uncertainty: The closer Japan gets to a neutral interest rate, the harder it becomes to pinpoint the exact level, according to Takata. This reinforces the data-dependent approach the BoJ is likely to adopt, avoiding pre-committed paths for future rate hikes. No Specific Rate Hike Targets: Takata explicitly states “No specific target, timing for further rate hikes.” Future decisions will hinge on corporate activity, economic data, and market movements. This underscores the BoJ’s flexible and reactive policy stance. ETF Holdings: A Deliberate Approach to Unwinding The BoJ’s massive ETF holdings are a legacy of past aggressive easing policies. Takata’s comments on this front are equally revealing: No Immediate Sale Debate: It’s “still not at [the] stage to debate sale of the BoJ’s ETF holdings.” This suggests that unwinding the ETF portfolio is not an immediate priority and will likely be a gradual, long-term process. Careful Deliberation Required: Takata emphasizes that “how to unload BoJ’s ETF holdings is something the BoJ must take time to deliberate.” This highlights the complexity and potential market impact of such a move. A hasty or poorly communicated approach could trigger market instability. Market Reaction and USD/JPY Dynamics The immediate market reaction to Takata’s comments saw USD/JPY trading slightly lower. This could be attributed to: Uncertainty Aversion: Takata’s cautious tone and lack of specific guidance might have introduced a degree of uncertainty, leading to some Yen strength as a safe-haven asset. No Hawkish Signals: The absence of any hawkish signals regarding imminent rate hikes or aggressive policy tightening could have tempered expectations of further Yen appreciation, leading to a modest USD/JPY decline. However, the overall impact on USD/JPY remains relatively contained. The currency pair is still influenced by a multitude of factors, including broader US dollar strength, global risk sentiment, and interest rate differentials between the US and Japan. The Broader Implications for Forex and Crypto Markets While Takata’s comments directly relate to JGB yields and monetary policy in Japan, they have broader implications for forex and even cryptocurrency markets: Forex Volatility: Central bank communications, or the lack thereof, are key drivers of forex volatility. Traders need to closely monitor BoJ statements and actions to anticipate potential shifts in USD/JPY and other Yen pairs. Global Monetary Policy Interplay: The BoJ’s cautious approach is part of a global landscape where central banks are navigating complex economic conditions. The divergence or convergence of monetary policy across major economies impacts global capital flows and risk appetite, influencing both forex and crypto markets. Risk Sentiment and Safe Havens: Uncertainty surrounding central bank policy can influence risk sentiment. In times of uncertainty, safe-haven assets like the Japanese Yen may see increased demand, potentially impacting crypto markets as well, although the correlation is complex and varies. Conclusion: A Wait-and-See Approach from the BoJ BoJ Board Member Takata’s recent remarks, characterized by a deliberate silence on JGB yields and a cautious tone on future policy, signal a wait-and-see approach from the Bank of Japan. The BoJ is navigating a delicate path, aiming to normalize monetary policy gradually while remaining vigilant about market volatility and economic uncertainties. For traders in forex and crypto markets, understanding these nuances is crucial for anticipating potential market movements and making informed decisions. The focus remains squarely on incoming economic data, corporate activity, and global market dynamics as the BoJ charts its course forward.

40567318,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131065,1740020977,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Japanese Yen’s Powerful Surge: Riding High on BoJ-Fed Policy Divergence,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/japanese-yen-powerful-surge/,"In the fast-paced world of currency trading, shifts in central bank policies can create powerful waves. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts watching global markets, understanding these shifts is crucial as they often ripple through various asset classes. Currently, the Japanese Yen (JPY) is demonstrating remarkable strength against the US Dollar (USD), and the key driver? Divergent expectations from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the Federal Reserve (Fed). Let’s dive into why the Japanese Yen is gaining momentum and what it means for the USD/JPY pair. BoJ Rate Hike Expectations Fuel Japanese Yen Strength The Japanese Yen is currently enjoying a period of positive momentum, largely fueled by growing anticipation of further interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). After a prolonged period of ultra-loose monetary policy, the BoJ is hinting at a shift, a move that’s injecting strength into the Yen. Several factors are contributing to this hawkish outlook: Persistent Inflation Signals: Japan is showing increasing signs of broadening inflation, prompting BoJ officials to consider further tightening of monetary policy. BoJ Officials’ Hawkish Signals: Statements from BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda and Deputy Governor Himino have explicitly mentioned the possibility of additional rate hikes if economic conditions and price projections align with their targets. Board Member Hajime Takata further reinforced this by emphasizing the need for a gradual policy shift to mitigate potential upside price risks. Strong Economic Data: Japan’s robust Q4 GDP figures released earlier this week have bolstered expectations for policy tightening, suggesting the economy might be resilient enough to withstand rate increases. These factors combined are creating a strong tailwind for the Japanese Yen, making it an attractive currency as investors anticipate higher returns. Fed Rate Cut Bets Pressure US Dollar On the other side of the equation, the US Dollar is facing downward pressure due to increasing expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed). While the BoJ is hinting at tightening, the Fed is expected to ease its monetary policy, creating a significant divergence. Here’s why the USD is feeling the heat: Anticipation of Fed Rate Cuts: Market participants are increasingly pricing in expectations for the Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates in the near future. This anticipation weakens the appeal of the US Dollar as higher interest rates typically attract investment. FOMC Meeting Minutes in Focus: Traders are keenly awaiting the release of the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. These minutes are expected to provide further clues about the Fed’s future interest rate path. A dovish tone in the minutes could further solidify expectations of rate cuts and intensify pressure on the USD. This contrasting policy outlook – a potentially hawkish BoJ versus a dovish Fed – is the primary driver behind the current strength of the Japanese Yen against the US Dollar. USD/JPY Pair Under Pressure Amid Policy Divergence The divergent monetary policy expectations between the BoJ and the Fed are directly impacting the USD/JPY currency pair. The pair has been trending downwards, reflecting the Yen’s strength and the Dollar’s weakness. Here’s a breakdown of the current situation: Downward Trajectory: The USD/JPY pair has been consistently sliding, reaching the 151.70-151.65 area, indicating a clear bearish trend. Technical Levels in Play: From a technical standpoint, the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) around 152.65 is acting as immediate resistance. Further resistance lies at the 153.00 and 153.30-153.35 zones. Conversely, the 151.00 level is a crucial support, and a break below this could accelerate further declines. Market Sentiment: The overall market sentiment suggests continued downside for USD/JPY as long as the BoJ rate hike expectations remain intact and the Fed is anticipated to cut rates. The narrowing interest rate differential between Japan and the US further encourages flows towards the Yen, adding to the downward pressure on the USD/JPY pair. Technical Outlook for USD/JPY: Key Levels to Watch Understanding the technical levels is crucial for traders navigating the USD/JPY pair. Here’s a summary of key technical points: Level Significance 152.65 200-day SMA Resistance 153.00 & 153.30-153.35 Further Resistance Zones 154.75-154.80 Last Week’s Swing High (Supply Zone) 151.75 Immediate Support (Asian Session Trough) 151.25 Overnight Swing Low (Next Support) 151.00 Critical Psychological Support 150.00 Psychological Support Level 148.65 December 2024 Low (Major Support) For bullish traders, reclaiming and decisively clearing the resistance zones mentioned above is essential for any potential upward momentum. Conversely, for bearish traders, a sustained break below the 151.00 mark could open the door for a deeper decline towards the 150.00 and even 149.00 levels. FOMC Minutes: A Crucial Event for USD/JPY Traders The upcoming release of the FOMC meeting minutes is a highly anticipated event for USD/JPY traders. These minutes provide valuable insights into the Federal Reserve’s thinking and future policy direction. Here’s why they matter: Policy Outlook Clues: Investors will scrutinize the minutes for any hints about the timing and pace of potential interest rate cuts by the Fed. Vote Split Analysis: The minutes reveal the voting pattern of FOMC members, offering a deeper understanding of the committee’s consensus and potential dissenting views. Market Impact: A dovish tone in the FOMC minutes is likely to further weaken the US Dollar, potentially exacerbating the downward pressure on the USD/JPY pair. Conversely, a hawkish surprise could provide some support to the USD. Traders should closely monitor the FOMC minutes release at 19:00 GMT on Wednesday, February 19, 2025, as it could trigger significant volatility in the USD/JPY market. Conclusion: Yen’s Ascendancy Driven by Policy Divergence In conclusion, the Japanese Yen is currently demonstrating considerable strength against the US Dollar, primarily driven by the diverging monetary policy paths of the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve. The BoJ’s hints at further rate hikes, contrasted with expectations of Fed rate cuts, are creating a compelling narrative for Yen strength. For traders in the forex and crypto markets, keeping a close eye on the USD/JPY pair and the upcoming FOMC minutes is crucial, as these factors are likely to dictate the pair’s trajectory in the near term. The **powerful** combination of BoJ hawkishness and Fed dovishness presents a fascinating dynamic in the currency markets, with the Japanese Yen poised to potentially maintain its front-foot stance.

40567463,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131082,1740021258,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Gold Price Resilience: Recovers Early Losses, Holds Firm Near Record High Amid Trade War Fears",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gold-price-steady-record-high/,"In a market gripped by anticipation and geopolitical undercurrents, gold is showing its mettle. Despite early dips, the precious metal has bounced back, maintaining its position near record highs. Is this a temporary reprieve or a sign of sustained strength? Let’s delve into the factors driving the current gold price action and what to expect as we await crucial economic data. Gold Price Recovers Ground: A Rocky Start to the Day After starting the day with a slight negative bias, gold price quickly found its footing, trading comfortably above the $2,900 mark. This resilience comes as investors navigate a complex landscape of economic indicators and global uncertainties. The initial dip can be attributed to profit-taking after gold’s recent surge to record levels. However, the underlying bullish sentiment remains strong, fueled by concerns over trade wars and expectations of Federal Reserve policy easing. FOMC Minutes on the Horizon: Will They Trigger the Next Gold Rally? All eyes are now on the upcoming release of the FOMC minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting. These minutes are keenly awaited by market participants for clues about the future direction of US monetary policy. Specifically, investors are eager to gauge the Fed’s stance on interest rate cuts. Why is this so important for gold? Rate Cut Expectations: Lower interest rates generally weaken the US Dollar, making gold, which is priced in dollars, more attractive to investors holding other currencies. Dollar Weakness: A dovish tone in the FOMC minutes , suggesting a higher likelihood of rate cuts, could further undermine the US Dollar and provide a significant boost to gold price . Safe-Haven Appeal: Conversely, if the minutes reveal a more hawkish stance, it could strengthen the dollar and potentially lead to a temporary pullback in gold. However, any dip might be short-lived given the prevailing uncertainties. The FOMC minutes are more than just a historical record; they are a potential catalyst for the next major move in the gold price . Traders will be scrutinizing every word for hints about the Fed’s thinking and future actions. Trade War Fears Reignite: A Bullish Tailwind for Gold Adding to the bullish narrative for gold are renewed fears of a global trade war . President Trump’s tariff plans are once again in the spotlight, raising concerns about escalating trade tensions between major economies. In times of economic uncertainty and geopolitical instability, gold shines as a safe-haven asset. Here’s why trade war anxieties are gold’s ally: Economic Uncertainty: Trade wars disrupt global supply chains, dampen economic growth, and increase market volatility. This environment drives investors towards safe-haven assets like gold. Dollar Diversification: As trade tensions rise, countries may look to diversify away from the US Dollar, potentially increasing demand for gold as an alternative reserve asset. Inflation Hedge: Some believe that trade wars can lead to inflationary pressures, and gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation, further boosting its appeal. The specter of a trade war is not new, but its resurgence is providing a significant layer of support for gold price , limiting any potential downside. Rate Cut Bets Firm Up: Fueling Gold’s Ascent The market consensus is increasingly leaning towards further rate cut s by the Federal Reserve this year. Recent economic data, including weaker-than-expected retail sales and mixed inflation signals, have reinforced these expectations. Currently, Fed Funds Futures are pricing in a substantial possibility of a rate cut of at least 40 basis points by the end of the year. This dovish outlook is a major tailwind for gold: Impact of Rate Cut Expectations on Gold Factor Impact on Gold Price Lower Interest Rates Reduces the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold. Weaker US Dollar Makes gold cheaper for international buyers, increasing demand. Increased Investment Appeal Drives investors towards gold as a safe and potentially appreciating asset in a low-rate environment. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly’s recent comments, suggesting a cautious approach to interest rate adjustments, further solidify the expectation that rate cut s are on the horizon. This anticipation is a key driver behind gold’s sustained strength. Record High in Sight? Gold’s Technical Outlook Technically, gold price remains in a bullish consolidation phase after its impressive run to all-time highs. While the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates overbought conditions, suggesting potential for consolidation, the overall setup favors further upside. Key technical levels to watch: Resistance: The immediate hurdle remains the $2,940-$2,942 zone, coinciding with the record high reached earlier this month. A decisive break above this level could trigger a fresh wave of buying and propel gold to new peaks. Support: On the downside, immediate support lies around $2,925, followed by the psychological $2,900 mark and the $2,878-$2,876 range. A break below the latter could signal a deeper correction. Bullish Bias: Despite potential short-term pullbacks, the prevailing technical picture suggests that the path of least resistance for gold price remains upwards. For gold bulls, the focus is now on breaching the record high barrier. A successful breakout could unleash significant pent-up demand and confirm the continuation of the long-term uptrend. Actionable Insights for Gold Traders Monitor FOMC Minutes: Pay close attention to the tone and details of the FOMC minutes release. A dovish stance could be a strong buy signal for gold. Track Trade War Developments: Stay informed about any news related to US tariff policies and global trade tensions. Escalation in trade war rhetoric is typically positive for gold. Watch Key Support and Resistance Levels: Keep an eye on the technical levels mentioned above. A break above $2,942 could be a trigger to add to long positions, while a break below $2,876 might warrant caution. Consider Dollar Movements: The US Dollar’s performance will continue to be a crucial factor influencing gold price . Dollar weakness generally translates to gold strength. Conclusion: Gold’s Golden Opportunity? Gold’s resilience in the face of early selling pressure highlights the underlying strength of the market. Fueled by trade war fears, expectations of rate cut s, and the upcoming FOMC minutes , gold is poised for potential further gains. While short-term volatility is always possible, the fundamental and technical outlook for gold remains constructive. Will gold break through its record high and embark on a new ascent? The coming days and weeks will be crucial in determining the next chapter in gold’s fascinating journey.

40567554,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131097,1740021310,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Resilient Australian Dollar Stands Firm Against US Dollar as Anxious Eyes Turn to FOMC Minutes,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/australian-dollar-us-dollar-fomc/,"In the dynamic world of currency trading, the Australian Dollar (AUD) has shown remarkable resilience, maintaining its ground against a weakening US Dollar (USD). Despite fresh trade tensions sparked by US President Donald Trump and mixed economic data, the AUD/USD pair is holding steady. All eyes are now on the upcoming release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes, which could be a pivotal moment for the future direction of both currencies. Are you ready to dive into the factors influencing the currency market and what the FOMC Minutes might unveil? Australian Dollar’s Quiet Strength Amidst Global Uncertainty The Australian Dollar has demonstrated surprising strength, appreciating even as the US Dollar faces headwinds. This comes despite new tariff threats from the US, a move that typically fuels risk aversion and could pressure currencies like the AUD. Let’s break down the key factors at play: Wage Growth Misses Expectations: Australia’s Wage Price Index for Q4 2024 rose by 0.7% QoQ, slightly below the 0.8% forecast. While this might seem negative, the annual growth remains at a solid 3.2%. This data point offers a nuanced picture of the Australian economy. RBA Rate Cut Priced In: The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) recently cut its Official Cash Rate (OCR) to 4.10%, the first cut in four years. This was largely anticipated by the market, and surprisingly, didn’t trigger a massive AUD sell-off, suggesting much of the dovish sentiment was already factored into the price. US Dollar Under Pressure: Conversely, the US Dollar is experiencing depreciation as US Treasury yields decline, even with hawkish statements from some Federal Reserve officials. This divergence is creating an interesting dynamic in the AUD/USD pair. Why is the US Dollar Losing its Shine? Despite signals from some Fed members suggesting a cautious approach to interest rates , the US Dollar is struggling to find strong bullish momentum. Several factors are contributing to this weakness: Trump’s Tariff Threats Loom Large: President Trump’s announcement of potential 25% tariffs on foreign cars, and higher duties on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, has injected significant uncertainty into the market. These protectionist measures could dampen global trade and negatively impact the US economy in the long run, paradoxically weakening the USD. Mixed US Economic Data: Recent US Retail Sales figures showed a sharper-than-expected decline in January (-0.9%), contrasting with previous strong figures. This inconsistency in economic data is making it harder for the market to confidently predict the Fed’s next moves. Hawkish Fedspeak Not Enough: While San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, and Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman have expressed caution about premature rate cuts and highlighted persistent inflation, their words haven’t provided sustained support to the USD. The market seems to be waiting for more definitive signals. FOMC Minutes: The Potential Game-Changer All eyes are now fixed on the release of the FOMC Minutes. These minutes offer a detailed glimpse into the discussions and considerations that shaped the Federal Reserve’s recent policy decisions. Traders are eagerly awaiting this publication to glean insights into: Aspect Significance for Traders Vote Split Indicates the level of consensus within the FOMC and the strength of different policy viewpoints. Policy Outlook Provides clues about the Fed’s future stance on interest rates and monetary policy, influencing USD direction. Inflation Concerns Details the depth of concern about persistent inflation and the Fed’s willingness to act aggressively. Economic Growth Assessment Reveals the Fed’s perspective on the strength and sustainability of US economic growth, impacting risk sentiment. A hawkish tone in the FOMC Minutes, suggesting a greater likelihood of maintaining higher interest rates for longer, could provide a significant boost to the US Dollar. Conversely, a dovish stance, hinting at potential rate cuts sooner than anticipated, would likely weaken the USD and potentially benefit the Australian Dollar. AUD/USD Technical Outlook: Bullish Momentum Building? From a technical perspective, the AUD/USD pair is exhibiting a bullish bias. Trading around 0.6360, the pair is moving within an ascending channel pattern. Key technical indicators suggest continued upward potential: Ascending Channel: This pattern typically indicates a bullish trend, suggesting further potential gains for the AUD/USD. Relative Strength Index (RSI): With the 14-day RSI above 50, momentum favors the upside, reinforcing the bullish outlook. Key Resistance and Support Levels: Resistance: The upper boundary of the ascending channel and the psychological level of 0.6400 are key resistance points. Support: The 9-day EMA at 0.6327 and the 14-day EMA at 0.6309 offer immediate support, with a stronger support zone near the lower channel boundary at 0.6290. Australian Dollar Performance Snapshot Let’s look at how the Australian Dollar is performing against other major currencies today: USD EUR GBP JPY CAD AUD NZD CHF USD -0.02% -0.06% -0.14% -0.03% -0.16% -0.28% -0.01% EUR 0.02% -0.04% -0.08% -0.02% -0.14% -0.26% 0.00% GBP 0.06% 0.04% -0.08% 0.03% -0.10% -0.22% 0.05% JPY 0.14% 0.08% 0.08% 0.08% -0.05% -0.18% 0.10% CAD 0.03% 0.02% -0.03% -0.08% -0.13% -0.25% 0.01% AUD 0.16% 0.14% 0.10% 0.05% 0.13% -0.12% 0.16% NZD 0.28% 0.26% 0.22% 0.18% 0.25% 0.12% 0.27% CHF 0.00% -0.01% -0.05% -0.10% -0.01% -0.16% -0.27% Table: Percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against major currencies today. As you can see, the Australian Dollar is showing strength against the US Dollar and several other major currencies, highlighting its current outperformance in the currency market . Conclusion: Brace for Potential Volatility The Australian Dollar is currently navigating a complex landscape of global economic factors. While showing resilience against a weaker US Dollar, the AUD/USD pair remains sensitive to risk sentiment and, crucially, the signals emanating from the Federal Reserve. The FOMC Minutes release is a critical event that could inject significant volatility into the currency market . Traders should closely monitor the details within the minutes to anticipate potential shifts in interest rates expectations and the resulting impact on the Australian Dollar and the US Dollar .

Will Michael Saylor’s imminent BTC purchases and ETF filing speculation drive Bitcoin price rebound above $100,000 in the days ahead? Bitcoin Reclaims $97,000 as Trump Signals Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire Talks Bitcoin’s price rebounded sharply on Thursday, gaining 4% to reclaim the $97,000 level amid renewed optimism surrounding U.S.-Russia diplomatic engagement. This shift follows reports confirming that Washington and Moscow have resumed diplomatic talks, potentially laying the groundwork for a resolution to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Bitcoin Price Action (BTCUSD) | Feb 20, 2025 Market sentiment had deteriorated last week after hotter-than-expected U.S. CPI data reinforced expectations of prolonged US Federal Reserve (Fed) tightening. Investors reduced BTC exposure in anticipation of further rate hikes, triggering a pullback to $93,388. However, geopolitical developments appear to have offset these concerns. Reuters reported on Feb. 18 that U.S. and Russia had agreed to reopen diplomatic communications channels, triggering positive reactions across global financial markets. Bitcoin price mirrored the risk-on sentiment, rallying 4% within 24 hours of the announcement. In the latest developments, Kremlin official sources have hinted that – Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump could meet this month, in a first face-to-face encounter between leaders of both nation since the war began. With market confidence improving, BTC price trajectory now hinges on continued geopolitical de-escalation and investor positioning ahead of key economic data releases. How Will Bitcoin React to a Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire? Geopolitical risk has played a significant role in Bitcoin’s volatility since 2022, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict contributing to inflationary pressures and market instability. However, a potential ceasefire could reshape global economic conditions, particularly regarding energy prices, trade flows, and regulatory policy. Crypto Traders price-in 67% chance of Russia vs. Ukraine Ceasfire in 2025 | Source: PolyMarket, Feb 20, 2025 While major political voices in Europe and the UK called for further funding to support Ukraine’s defense, crypto bettors on the predictions market platform Polymarket have priced in a 67% chance of a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia in 2025. This confirms that majority of market watchers are anticipating a ceasefire in the coming months. A de-escalation scenario could lead to the lifting of economic sanctions, the reopening of critical trade routes, and an increase in Russian oil and gas exports. This would likely reduce energy-driven inflation, reinforcing the case for less hawkish Fed tweaks in the coming months. Beyond macroeconomic factors, crypto market dynamics could shift as well. A relaxation of financial restrictions may allow Russian investors to re-enter global crypto markets, increasing Bitcoin’s demand. Additionally, a more stable geopolitical backdrop may encourage institutional capital inflows into digital assets, particularly as ETF-driven adoption gains momentum. With the ongoing 4% BTC price rebound fueled by both geopolitical optimism and institutional accumulation, traders will closely watch upcoming developments for confirmation of a ceasefire. If positive momentum continues, BTC could break through $100,000, testing key resistance levels in the days ahead. Strategy Total Bitcoin Holdings as of Feb 20, 2025 | Source: SaylorTracker Notably, Michaell Saylor-led firm Strategy, (formerly known as Microstrategy) has announced a decision to raise another $2 billion in debt instruments to fund additional BTC purchases. With altcoin ETF filing nearing approval, an end to the Russian vs. Ukraine could spark the next wave of institutional-driven rally for top-ranked cryptocurrencies including BTC. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Multi-day Closes Above $98,000 Could Mark Local Bottom Bitcoin price forecast chart below shows BTC hovering near $97,000, rebounding from the lower Bollinger Band ($94,339) as buyers regain control. The recent two-day rally of 3.78% suggests a potential bottoming pattern forming around the $94,000-$96,000 range. However, a definitive shift in momentum hinges on BTC securing multiple daily closes above $98,000, aligning with the mid-Bollinger Band and key resistance zone. Bitcoin price forecast | BTCUSDT The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 46.66 remains below the neutral 50 level, indicating weak bullish momentum but potential upside if it crosses above its signal line (44.16). A confirmed RSI breakout could accelerate BTC’s move toward the psychological $100,000 mark. Conversely, failure to reclaim $98,000 may trigger another retest of the $94,000 support, with deeper downside risk toward $92,000 if sellers strengthen. Volume analysis highlights rising accumulation, with a notable 41.44K BTC traded over the last two days, reinforcing buying interest near current levels. If geopolitical optimism persists and Bitcoin ETFs maintain steady inflows, bullish continuation remains the favored scenario. However, traders should remain cautious of short-term profit-taking near resistance.

The United Kingdom just dropped a bombshell – inflation is hotter than expected, and it’s sending ripples across the Forex markets. January’s UK CPI inflation data has surged to a startling 3% year-over-year, significantly surpassing the anticipated 2.8%. This unexpected jump has ignited speculation about the Bank of England’s next moves and is currently keeping a firm floor under the GBP/USD pair. Let’s dive into what this means for your trades and the broader economic landscape. Why is UK CPI Inflation Surging and What Does It Mean for GBP/USD? The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reveal a significant uptick in the UK CPI inflation . Here’s a breakdown of the key numbers: Headline CPI (YoY): Rose to 3% in January, up from 2.5% in December and above the 2.8% forecast. Core CPI (YoY): Increased to 3.7%, matching expectations but still higher than December’s 3.2%. Services Inflation (YoY): Climbed to a worrying 5% in January, compared to 4.4% the previous month. Monthly CPI (MoM): Decreased by 0.1% in January, less than the expected -0.3% decline. This hotter-than-expected inflation print signals persistent price pressures within the UK economy, moving further away from the Bank of England’s (BoE) 2% target. For GBP/USD , this initially translated to resilience. The pair held its ground above the 1.2600 level, as traders digested the implications for future BoE policy. How Did Forex Markets React to the Inflation Shock? While the initial reaction in Forex markets was muted, with GBP/USD remaining relatively stable, the underlying sentiment is shifting. The table below illustrates the British Pound’s performance against major currencies today: USD EUR GBP JPY CAD AUD NZD CHF USD -0.09% -0.09% -0.27% -0.04% -0.20% -0.38% -0.06% EUR 0.09% -0.00% -0.16% 0.04% -0.11% -0.29% 0.03% GBP 0.09% 0.00% -0.19% 0.05% -0.11% -0.29% 0.03% JPY 0.27% 0.16% 0.19% 0.22% 0.06% -0.13% 0.20% CAD 0.04% -0.04% -0.05% -0.22% -0.16% -0.33% -0.02% AUD 0.20% 0.11% 0.11% -0.06% 0.16% -0.18% 0.14% NZD 0.38% 0.29% 0.29% 0.13% 0.33% 0.18% 0.32% CHF 0.06% -0.03% -0.03% -0.20% 0.02% -0.14% -0.32% Heatmap showing percentage changes of major currencies. Source: Bitcoin World Team As you can see, the British Pound demonstrated strength against the US Dollar, highlighting the potential bullish implications of persistent inflation. Will the Bank of England Rethink Rate Cuts Amidst Rising Inflation? This inflation report puts the Bank of England (BoE) in a tricky spot. Earlier this month, the BoE already lowered interest rates, signaling a potential easing cycle. However, Governor Andrew Bailey emphasized a cautious approach, stressing the need for underlying inflation to ease further before considering more cuts. The hotter-than-expected January CPI data throws a wrench into these plans. Key considerations for the BoE include: Deviation from Target: Inflation is now significantly above the 2% target, increasing pressure on the BoE to act. Services Inflation: The alarming rise in services inflation is particularly concerning, as it often indicates stickier, more persistent price pressures. Market Expectations: The data challenges market expectations of aggressive rate cuts, potentially forcing a recalibration of BoE policy outlook. TD Securities analysts had previewed this potential rebound in inflation, attributing it partly to temporary factors like airfares. However, even with temporary factors at play, the overall inflation level is likely to make the BoE uncomfortable and could lead to a more hawkish stance. Trading GBP/USD: Key Levels to Watch After the Inflation Data From a technical perspective, as Bitcoin World’s Asian Session Lead Analyst, Dhwani Mehta, points out, GBP/USD is navigating crucial resistance levels. Here’s what traders should monitor: Resistance: The pair is testing resistance around 1.2605. A break above the 100-day SMA at 1.2665 could pave the way towards 1.2700 and even the 200-day SMA at 1.2788. Support: Immediate support lies at the confluence of the 21-day and 50-day SMAs around 1.2460. A break below this could lead to further declines towards the trendline support from the January 13 low at 1.2357. Technical Indicators: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains above 50, and a potential Bull Cross formation (21-day SMA crossing above the 50-day SMA) suggests continued upward momentum. In essence, a stronger inflation print supports a bullish outlook for GBP/USD as it diminishes expectations of aggressive BoE rate cuts. Conversely, weaker inflation data could reignite rate cut bets and trigger a potential GBP/USD correction. Inflation Explained: FAQs for Crypto and Forex Traders Understanding inflation is crucial for navigating both crypto and Forex markets. Here are some key FAQs: What is Inflation and Why Does It Matter? Inflation is simply the rate at which prices for goods and services are rising, eroding purchasing power over time. Central banks like the BoE aim to keep inflation at a target level (usually 2%) to ensure economic stability. High inflation can lead to: Decreased purchasing power Increased cost of borrowing Economic uncertainty Headline inflation includes all goods and services, while core inflation excludes volatile items like food and energy, providing a clearer picture of underlying price pressures. How Does CPI Measure Inflation? The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a primary tool for measuring inflation. It tracks changes in the prices of a basket of goods and services commonly consumed by households. Central banks often target core CPI as it’s considered a more reliable indicator of persistent inflation trends. When core CPI rises above the target, central banks typically raise interest rates to cool down the economy and curb inflation. Conversely, falling CPI can lead to interest rate cuts. Inflation’s Impact on Forex: Counterintuitive but True? It might seem surprising, but higher inflation can actually strengthen a currency. This is because central banks tend to raise interest rates to combat inflation. Higher interest rates attract foreign investment as investors seek better returns, increasing demand for the currency and pushing its value up. Gold vs. Inflation: Is Gold Still an Inflation Hedge? Historically, gold was seen as a safe-haven asset during inflationary periods. However, in today’s environment, the relationship is more nuanced. While gold can still act as a safe haven during extreme market turmoil, high inflation often prompts central banks to raise interest rates. Higher interest rates increase the opportunity cost of holding gold (which doesn’t yield interest), making interest-bearing assets more attractive. Therefore, in a high-inflation, rising-interest-rate environment, gold may not always perform as a traditional inflation hedge. Stay Ahead of the Curve in Forex Markets The UK CPI inflation surge is a stark reminder of the dynamic nature of economic data and its immediate impact on Forex markets . For crypto and Forex traders, staying informed and understanding these macroeconomic indicators is paramount.

40567702,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131125,1740021741,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Verified: Coinbase Introduces Proof of Reserves for cbBTC, Boosting Crypto Transparency",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-proof-reserves-cbbtc/,"In a significant stride towards enhanced transparency within the cryptocurrency realm, Coinbase, a leading crypto exchange, has officially rolled out a dedicated proof-of-reserves (PoR) page for its wrapped Bitcoin token, cbBTC. This move, initially reported by BeInCrypto, aims to provide users with verifiable assurance regarding the backing of cbBTC with actual Bitcoin reserves. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the broader crypto ecosystem. What is Proof of Reserves and Why Does it Matter for cbBTC? Proof of Reserves (PoR) is a crucial concept in the world of cryptocurrency, especially for wrapped tokens like cbBTC. Essentially, it’s a process that allows a custodian or issuer of a token to publicly demonstrate that they hold sufficient reserves of the underlying asset to back the tokens they have issued. In the case of cbBTC, which is designed to be a wrapped version of Bitcoin on other blockchains, PoR verifies that Coinbase holds an equivalent amount of Bitcoin for all the cbBTC tokens in circulation. Why is this important? Think of wrapped tokens as representations of real assets in the crypto world. If you hold cbBTC, you’re essentially holding a token that is supposed to be backed 1:1 by Bitcoin held by Coinbase. Without proof of reserves, there’s always a lingering question: Does Coinbase really have all that Bitcoin they claim to have? PoR addresses this question head-on, offering verifiable evidence and building trust. Here’s a breakdown of why Proof of Reserves is a game-changer: Transparency and Trust: PoR injects a dose of much-needed transparency into the often opaque world of crypto. By publicly disclosing their Bitcoin reserves, Coinbase is fostering greater trust with its users and the wider crypto community. Reduced Risk of Fractional Reserves: In traditional finance, fractional reserve banking has been a source of instability. In crypto, the concern is similar – are custodians truly holding the assets they are supposed to be? PoR minimizes the risk of fractional reserves for cbBTC, ensuring each token is genuinely backed. Investor Confidence: For investors, especially institutional ones, proof of reserves is a critical factor in gaining confidence in crypto assets. It provides a level of security and assurance that is often demanded in traditional markets. Ecosystem Stability: When major players like Coinbase implement PoR, it sets a positive precedent for the entire crypto ecosystem. It encourages other exchanges and custodians to adopt similar practices, leading to a more stable and trustworthy environment. Coinbase’s Bold Step Towards Transparency: Introducing Proof of Reserves for cbBTC Coinbase’s unveiling of a dedicated PoR page for cbBTC is a significant step forward for the exchange and the crypto industry as a whole. According to the report, Coinbase is currently holding a substantial 26,525.15 BTC in reserves . This impressive figure backs a circulating supply of 26,461.05 cbBTC tokens spread across multiple prominent blockchains, including Ethereum, Base, Solana, and Arbitrum. This multi-chain support highlights cbBTC’s versatility and reach within the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. What’s even more reassuring is Coinbase’s decision to disclose the individual Bitcoin addresses where these reserves are held. This level of detail allows anyone to independently verify the existence and quantity of the Bitcoin reserves using blockchain explorers. It’s not just about taking Coinbase’s word for it; it’s about verifiable, on-chain evidence. This commitment to open verification is a hallmark of true transparency. Let’s break down the key figures and facts: Metric Value Bitcoin Reserves Held by Coinbase 26,525.15 BTC cbBTC Supply 26,461.05 tokens Blockchains Supported Ethereum, Base, Solana, Arbitrum Verification Method Publicly Disclosed Bitcoin Addresses This data paints a clear picture: Coinbase is maintaining a healthy reserve of Bitcoin that comfortably exceeds the circulating supply of cbBTC. The slight surplus in reserves (26,525.15 BTC reserves vs. 26,461.05 cbBTC supply) could be interpreted as a buffer, further enhancing the security and reliability of cbBTC. Addressing Centralization Concerns: How Proof of Reserves for cbBTC Builds Trust cbBTC, like many wrapped tokens, has faced scrutiny in the past, particularly regarding concerns about centralization. Critics, including prominent figures like Tron (TRX) founder Justin Sun, have voiced apprehensions about the centralized nature of wrapped Bitcoin solutions. The core concern revolves around the fact that a central entity (like Coinbase in this case) controls the underlying Bitcoin reserves. This centralization introduces potential risks, such as regulatory pressure or operational vulnerabilities, that are less prevalent in truly decentralized cryptocurrencies. Proof of Reserves directly addresses these centralization concerns by providing a mechanism for external verification. While it doesn’t eliminate centralization entirely, it significantly mitigates the risks associated with it. Here’s how: Reduced Reliance on Trust: PoR shifts the paradigm from blind trust to verifiable trust. Users no longer have to solely rely on Coinbase’s reputation; they can independently verify the reserves. Increased Accountability: By making their reserves public, Coinbase is holding itself accountable to the community. Any discrepancy between the cbBTC supply and Bitcoin reserves would be readily apparent, incentivizing Coinbase to maintain its commitment to full backing. Enhanced Security Perceptions: Transparency breeds confidence. Knowing that cbBTC is backed by verifiable Bitcoin reserves makes it a more attractive and secure option for users looking to utilize Bitcoin on different blockchains. While PoR is a powerful tool, it’s important to acknowledge that it’s not a complete solution to centralization risks. The ultimate ideal for many crypto purists is decentralization in every aspect. However, in the current landscape, where wrapped tokens play a vital role in bridging different blockchain ecosystems, proof of reserves represents a pragmatic and impactful step towards greater security and user confidence. It’s about making centralized solutions as transparent and trustworthy as possible. Benefits of cbBTC Proof of Reserves: A Win for Crypto Investors The introduction of proof of reserves for cbBTC is not just a procedural update; it brings tangible benefits to crypto investors and the broader DeFi space. Let’s explore some key advantages: Enhanced Security and Peace of Mind: For cbBTC holders, PoR translates to enhanced security and peace of mind. Knowing that your wrapped Bitcoin is truly backed by real Bitcoin reserves provides a strong sense of security, especially in a volatile market. Greater Utility for Wrapped Bitcoin: With increased confidence in cbBTC’s backing, users are more likely to utilize it in various DeFi applications across Ethereum, Solana, and other supported blockchains. This can unlock greater utility and liquidity for wrapped Bitcoin. Attracting Institutional Investment: Institutional investors, who often prioritize security and regulatory compliance, are more likely to engage with crypto assets that demonstrate robust transparency measures like PoR. Coinbase’s move could pave the way for increased institutional adoption of cbBTC and wrapped Bitcoin in general. Setting a New Industry Standard for Crypto Transparency: Coinbase, as a leading exchange, is setting a positive example for the industry. Their implementation of PoR for cbBTC could encourage other exchanges and wrapped token issuers to adopt similar transparency measures, leading to a more trustworthy and mature crypto market. Navigating the Landscape of Wrapped Bitcoin: Understanding cbBTC in the Broader Context cbBTC is not the only wrapped Bitcoin solution available in the crypto market. Projects like Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and renBTC also aim to bring Bitcoin to different blockchains, primarily Ethereum. Each of these solutions has its own approach and set of characteristics. Understanding cbBTC in this broader context is crucial for making informed decisions. While WBTC is currently the dominant player in the wrapped Bitcoin space in terms of market capitalization and adoption, cbBTC, backed by Coinbase, brings its own unique strengths to the table. Coinbase’s reputation, regulatory compliance, and now, its commitment to proof of reserves, position cbBTC as a compelling alternative. The multi-chain support for cbBTC, extending beyond Ethereum to Solana, Base, and Arbitrum, further broadens its appeal and potential use cases. Here’s a simplified comparison: Feature cbBTC (Coinbase) WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) Issuer Coinbase BitGo, Kyber Network, Ren, others (Decentralized Consortium) Proof of Reserves Yes (Publicly Disclosed Addresses) Yes (Audits and On-chain Data) Blockchains Supported Ethereum, Base, Solana, Arbitrum Primarily Ethereum (also others) Centralization Centralized (Coinbase) Somewhat Decentralized (Consortium) Ultimately, the choice between different wrapped Bitcoin solutions depends on individual user preferences and priorities. cbBTC, with its Coinbase backing and now, robust proof of reserves, presents a compelling option for those seeking a transparent and secure way to access Bitcoin on various blockchains. Conclusion: A Transparent Future for Wrapped Bitcoin Coinbase’s introduction of proof of reserves for cbBTC marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of wrapped Bitcoin and crypto transparency. By providing verifiable evidence of their Bitcoin reserves, Coinbase is not only enhancing the credibility of cbBTC but also setting a new benchmark for trust and accountability in the cryptocurrency industry. This move is a powerful signal that transparency is not just a buzzword but a core principle for the future of crypto. As the crypto landscape continues to mature, initiatives like proof of reserves will be instrumental in fostering wider adoption, building investor confidence, and paving the way for a more secure and transparent decentralized financial system.

U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have been a subject of intense interest and investment lately, experienced a significant shift. Data from Farside Investors revealed a combined net outflow of $60.7 million . This figure raises eyebrows and prompts crucial questions about the current sentiment surrounding Bitcoin and crypto investments. Let’s delve deeper into what this means for the market and individual investors. Decoding the Shocking Bitcoin ETF Outflows: What Happened on February 18th? On February 18th, the collective U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs landscape saw a notable change in investor behavior. While some ETFs continued to attract inflows, the overall picture was painted in red with a net outflow of $60.7 million. This aggregate number signifies that more capital was withdrawn from these ETFs than invested on that particular day. To understand the nuances, let’s break down the performance of individual ETFs: BlackRock’s IBIT: Bucking the trend, IBIT recorded a substantial net inflow of $68.4 million . This positive inflow suggests continued investor confidence in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF offering. Fidelity’s FBTC: In contrast, Fidelity’s FBTC faced a net outflow of $16.4 million . This indicates that on February 18th, more investors chose to withdraw funds from FBTC than deposit new capital. Bitwise’s BITB: The most significant outflow was observed in Bitwise’s BITB, which saw a net outflow of $112.7 million . This substantial withdrawal contributes heavily to the overall negative net outflow for the day. Other ETFs: The remaining spot Bitcoin ETFs reported no significant net inflows or outflows, indicating a relatively neutral investor activity for these funds on February 18th. This data paints a mixed picture within the Bitcoin ETF market . While BlackRock’s IBIT demonstrates robust investor interest, the significant outflows from Fidelity and Bitwise, particularly BITB, dragged the overall market sentiment down for the day. Why the Sudden Shift in Bitcoin Investment Sentiment? The question arises: what factors could have contributed to this net outflow in Bitcoin investment products? Several potential reasons could be at play: Profit Taking: After a period of positive price action in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, some investors might have decided to take profits. Selling ETF holdings could be a part of this profit-taking strategy. Market Volatility Concerns: The crypto market is inherently volatile. Increased volatility or perceived risks might lead some investors to reduce their exposure to Bitcoin ETFs, opting for safer assets or waiting for market stabilization. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic news, inflation data, interest rate decisions, and geopolitical events can all influence investor sentiment and risk appetite. Negative macroeconomic signals could trigger outflows from riskier assets like Bitcoin ETFs. Rotation into Other Assets: Investors might be reallocating capital from Bitcoin ETFs to other asset classes that appear more attractive at the moment, such as equities, bonds, or even other cryptocurrencies. ETF-Specific Factors: While less likely for established players like Fidelity and Bitwise, fund-specific issues or investor concerns related to particular ETF providers could also contribute to outflows. It’s crucial to remember that a single day’s net outflow does not necessarily indicate a long-term trend reversal. The Crypto ETF trends are influenced by a multitude of factors and require continuous monitoring and analysis over a longer period. BlackRock’s IBIT: A Silver Lining in the Outflow Cloud? Amidst the overall net outflows, BlackRock’s IBIT stands out as a beacon of continued investor confidence. The significant inflow into IBIT while other major ETFs experienced outflows suggests a few possibilities: Brand Trust and Reputation: BlackRock’s established reputation and massive scale in traditional finance might instill greater confidence among investors, especially institutional ones, compared to newer or smaller ETF providers in the crypto space. Lower Fees: IBIT’s fee structure might be more attractive to some investors compared to competitors, drawing in more capital even during periods of market uncertainty. Strategic Accumulation: Some investors might view the broader market dip or outflow as an opportunity to strategically accumulate more Bitcoin exposure through a trusted vehicle like IBIT, anticipating future price appreciation. BlackRock’s consistent positive inflows since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs highlight the power of brand recognition and perceived security in the nascent crypto ETF market. Navigating the Bitcoin ETF Landscape: Actionable Insights for Investors So, what should investors make of these recent Bitcoin ETF outflows? Here are some actionable insights: Don’t Panic Sell: A single day’s net outflow is not necessarily a cause for alarm. Avoid knee-jerk reactions based on short-term market fluctuations. Monitor Trends, Not Just Daily Data: Focus on longer-term trends in Bitcoin ETF flows and overall market sentiment rather than getting fixated on daily numbers. Diversify Your Portfolio: Bitcoin ETFs can be a part of a diversified investment strategy, but it’s crucial to avoid over-allocation to any single asset class, especially in volatile markets. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, macroeconomic developments, and regulatory updates that can impact the crypto market and Bitcoin ETFs. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals before making decisions about Bitcoin ETF investments. Crypto investments are inherently risky and not suitable for all investors. Conclusion: The Ever-Evolving Bitcoin ETF Story The $60.7 million net outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on February 18th serves as a reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the outflows raise some concerns, the continued strength of BlackRock’s IBIT and the complex interplay of market factors suggest that this is likely a temporary fluctuation rather than a fundamental shift in long-term investor sentiment. The Bitcoin ETF story is still being written, and ongoing monitoring, informed decision-making, and a balanced perspective are crucial for navigating this exciting yet volatile investment landscape.

40568028,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131128,1740022205,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Revolutionary STOs: A Promising Fundraising Avenue for Small Firms, Says Ex-Coinbase CTO",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stos-promising-fundraising-small-firms/,"Are you a small business owner tired of the complex and costly routes to raise capital? Imagine a world where fundraising is streamlined, accessible globally, and bypasses the traditional burdens of Wall Street. According to Balaji Srinivasan, the former CTO of cryptocurrency exchange giant Coinbase, this future might be closer than you think, thanks to Securities Token Offerings (STOs) . Srinivasan recently suggested that STOs could emerge as a game-changing alternative for small firms seeking capital, potentially overshadowing conventional methods like Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and Mergers & Acquisitions (M&As), especially under a Trump administration. Why STOs Could Be a Revolutionary Fundraising Tool for Small Firms? Srinivasan’s bold prediction hinges on the evolving regulatory landscape and the inherent advantages of Securities Token Offering . Let’s break down the key factors that are positioning STOs as a potentially revolutionary fundraising avenue for small firms : Bypassing IPO Burdens : The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), enacted in 2002, was intended to enhance corporate governance and financial disclosures. However, Srinivasan argues that it has inadvertently created significant hurdles for smaller companies aiming to go public via IPOs . The compliance costs and regulatory complexities associated with IPOs under SEC guidelines can be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming for small firms . STOs, in contrast, offer a potentially less cumbersome route to accessing public markets. Navigating M&A Roadblocks : Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As) have long been a strategy for growth and exit for businesses. However, Srinivasan points to a shift in regulatory attitude, particularly under Lina Khan’s FTC, where major M&As are facing increased scrutiny and blocks. While Srinivasan disagrees with this stance, he acknowledges that even a Trump administration has shown similar tendencies. This makes M&As a less certain path for small firms . Global Investor Access via Crypto : Perhaps the most compelling advantage of Securities Token Offering is its ability to tap into a global pool of investors through cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional securities offerings, STOs can leverage blockchain technology to offer tokens representing securities to investors worldwide, regardless of geographical limitations. This democratizes investment and opens up unprecedented fundraising opportunities for small firms in the US and beyond. Maintaining Independence : Another significant benefit highlighted by Srinivasan is that STOs allow companies to raise capital without relinquishing ownership stakes in the same way as traditional equity fundraising rounds or M&As. Investors in STOs purchase security tokens, which can represent various forms of investment contracts, but don’t necessarily translate to direct ownership or control. This empowers small firms to remain independent for longer, fostering innovation and competition. STOs vs. IPOs and M&As: A Quick Comparison To better understand why Srinivasan believes STOs are poised to become a more viable option, let’s compare them side-by-side with traditional IPOs and M&As: Feature Initial Public Offering (IPO) Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) Securities Token Offering (STO) Primary Goal Raise capital by selling shares to the public Growth, market expansion, exit strategy Raise capital through tokenized securities Regulatory Burden High (SEC, SOX compliance) Moderate to High (Antitrust, SEC depending on structure) Evolving but potentially lower than IPOs Investor Base Primarily institutional and accredited investors initially, then public Usually limited to strategic acquirers or larger companies Global, potentially wider range including retail and crypto investors Ownership Dilution Yes, significant equity dilution Complete or majority ownership transfer Potentially less direct ownership dilution, flexible token structures Cost & Time High cost, lengthy process (months to years) High cost, lengthy process (months to years) Potentially lower cost, faster process (weeks to months) Independence Reduced control due to public shareholders Loss of independence, company absorbed Maintains greater independence Are There Challenges to the STO Revolution? While the prospect of STOs as a superior fundraising mechanism is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the existing challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty : The regulatory landscape for STOs is still evolving globally. While the U.S. has provided some clarity, navigating securities laws and compliance across different jurisdictions can be complex. Clearer and harmonized regulations are needed for widespread adoption. Investor Education and Adoption : Securities Token Offering is a relatively new concept. Educating investors about the nature of security tokens, their risks and rewards, and the underlying technology is paramount. Mainstream investor adoption will take time and effort. Market Infrastructure : A robust ecosystem of exchanges, custodians, and service providers is essential for a thriving STO market. While progress is being made, the infrastructure is not as mature as traditional capital markets. Security and Trust : As with any cryptocurrency-related venture, security and trust are critical. Ensuring the security of token issuance, trading platforms, and investor assets is paramount to building confidence in the STO space. Actionable Insights for Small Firms Considering STOs For small firms exploring alternative fundraising strategies, STOs present a compelling option. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Educate Yourself : Dive deep into understanding Securities Token Offering , the regulatory requirements in your target jurisdictions, and the technology involved. Assess Your Needs : Evaluate your capital requirements, long-term goals, and tolerance for regulatory complexity. Determine if an STO aligns with your overall business strategy better than traditional IPOs or pursuing M&As . Seek Expert Advice : Consult with legal, financial, and technology experts specializing in STOs. Navigating the legal and technical aspects requires specialized knowledge. Build a Strong Community : Engage with the crypto and blockchain community. Building a strong online presence and community support can be crucial for a successful STO. Prioritize Compliance : Compliance with securities regulations is non-negotiable. Ensure your STO is structured to meet all applicable legal requirements. Conclusion: The Future of Fundraising Might Be Tokenized Balaji Srinivasan’s prediction underscores a potentially transformative shift in how small firms access capital. Securities Token Offering offers a tantalizing vision of democratized fundraising , global investor access, and greater company independence. While challenges remain, the potential benefits of STOs are undeniable.

Bitcoin World data indicates a bullish surge in Crude Oil price , specifically West Texas Intermediate (WTI). This positive movement in the energy sector can often reflect broader market optimism, a sentiment keenly followed by crypto investors. Let’s dive into what’s driving this upward trend in the Oil market and what it means for the wider economy. Why is the WTI Crude Oil Price Showing Bullish Momentum? According to the latest Bitcoin World data , West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude Oil price is currently trading at $72.24 per barrel. This marks an increase from Tuesday’s closing price of $71.74. Brent Crude is also experiencing gains, rising to $75.94 from $75.45. This bullish trend suggests growing confidence in the energy market . But what exactly is WTI Oil, and why should you care? Decoding WTI Oil: The Light and Sweet Benchmark WTI, or West Texas Intermediate, is a specific type of Crude Oil that plays a significant role in global energy markets. It’s considered a ‘light’ and ‘sweet’ crude due to its low density and sulfur content, making it easier and cheaper to refine into gasoline and other products. Sourced primarily in the United States and distributed through Cushing, Oklahoma – often called ‘The Pipeline Crossroads of the World’ – WTI serves as a crucial benchmark for Oil market pricing globally. Its price fluctuations are closely watched by investors, economists, and yes, even those in the cryptocurrency space, as energy prices can have ripple effects across various asset classes. Here’s a quick breakdown of WTI Oil’s key characteristics: Type: Light, sweet crude oil Origin: United States (West Texas Intermediate) Distribution Hub: Cushing, Oklahoma Benchmark: Major global Oil market benchmark Quality: High-quality, easy to refine What Factors Fuel the Price of WTI Crude Oil? Like any asset, the Crude Oil price is governed by the fundamental forces of supply and demand. Several factors can influence these forces in the energy market , leading to price volatility. Let’s explore some of the key drivers: Global Economic Growth: A strong global economy typically translates to increased demand for oil as industries ramp up production and transportation needs grow. Conversely, economic slowdowns can dampen demand and pressure Crude Oil price downwards. Geopolitical Events: Political instability, conflicts, and international sanctions in oil-producing regions can significantly disrupt supply chains, causing prices to spike. Events in the Middle East, for example, often have a direct and immediate impact on the Oil market . OPEC Decisions: The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies (OPEC+) play a crucial role in managing global oil supply. Their decisions on production quotas can significantly influence the Crude Oil price . Cuts in production tend to raise prices, while increases can lower them. US Dollar Strength: Since oil is predominantly traded in US dollars, the dollar’s value has an inverse relationship with Crude Oil price . A weaker dollar can make oil cheaper for buyers using other currencies, potentially increasing demand and pushing prices up, and vice versa. Inventory Levels: Weekly inventory reports provide insights into the balance between supply and demand in the US energy market , a major consumer and producer of oil. How Do Oil Inventory Reports Sway WTI Price? Keep an eye on those inventory numbers! The American Petroleum Institute (API) and the Energy Information Agency (EIA) release weekly reports that can act as catalysts for WTI price fluctuations. These reports detail changes in crude oil inventories, reflecting the current supply and demand dynamics in the energy market . Here’s how inventory data impacts Crude Oil price : Decreasing Inventories: A drop in oil inventories usually signals stronger demand than supply. This perceived scarcity can lead to upward pressure on WTI price , making it bullish. Increasing Inventories: Conversely, a rise in inventories suggests that supply is outpacing demand. This oversupply scenario can exert downward pressure on prices, making it bearish. While both API and EIA reports offer valuable insights, the EIA data is generally considered more authoritative due to its status as a government agency. Traders often compare both reports, as they tend to be closely aligned, reinforcing market sentiment regarding the direction of Crude Oil price . OPEC’s Influence: Can Production Quotas Dictate WTI Price? Absolutely! OPEC, a consortium of 12 major oil-producing nations, wields significant influence over the global Oil market , and consequently, the WTI price . Twice a year, OPEC convenes to decide on production quotas for its member countries. These decisions can have a profound impact on global oil supply and demand dynamics. OPEC’s strategies and their impact on Crude Oil price : Production Cuts: When OPEC decides to reduce production quotas, it effectively tightens global oil supply. This scarcity typically leads to an increase in Crude Oil price . Production Increases: Conversely, if OPEC opts to increase production quotas, it injects more supply into the market. This increased supply can lead to a decrease in Crude Oil price . The expanded group, OPEC+, which includes Russia and other non-OPEC nations, further amplifies this influence. Therefore, keeping track of OPEC+ meetings and announcements is crucial for anyone monitoring the energy market and predicting future movements in Crude Oil price . Conclusion: Navigating the Crude Oil Price Landscape The current bullish trend in Crude Oil price , as highlighted by Bitcoin World data , reflects a complex interplay of global economic factors, geopolitical dynamics, and supply-side management. Understanding these drivers is essential for anyone involved in trading or simply interested in the broader economic picture. While the short-term outlook for WTI price appears positive, the energy market remains inherently volatile, influenced by a multitude of unpredictable events. Staying informed and considering diverse sources of analysis, including data-driven insights, is key to navigating this dynamic landscape.

The precious metal is currently holding its breath near record highs, and all eyes are on the upcoming release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes. Will these minutes provide the fuel for the next surge in the gold price ? Let’s dive into what’s driving gold and what to expect. Gold Price Consolidation: Calm Before the Storm? After hitting all-time peaks last week, the gold price has entered a phase of consolidation. Think of it as a coiled spring, ready to unleash its energy in either direction. Currently hovering near its recent highs, gold is showing resilience, supported by ongoing concerns about global trade tensions and expectations of future interest rates cuts by the Federal Reserve. Several factors are contributing to this bullish backdrop: Safe-Haven Demand : Fears of a potential trade war, sparked by US President Trump’s tariff policies, are keeping investors on edge. In times of economic uncertainty, gold shines as a classic safe-haven asset , attracting investors seeking to protect their wealth. Dovish Fed Expectations : The market is increasingly betting on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates , possibly as early as September or October. Lower interest rates make gold more attractive compared to interest-bearing assets like bonds, further supporting the gold price . Weakening USD : Expectations of Fed rate cuts are putting pressure on the USD . A weaker dollar typically makes gold, priced in USD , cheaper for investors holding other currencies, thus boosting demand. FOMC Minutes: Decoding the Fed’s Next Move on Interest Rates The spotlight is firmly on the FOMC minutes . These minutes offer a detailed glimpse into the Federal Reserve’s discussions and considerations during their last meeting. Traders and investors are eagerly awaiting these minutes to glean insights into the Fed’s future path for interest rates . Why are the FOMC minutes so important? Aspect Importance for Gold Price Interest Rate Signals Clues about the timing and extent of future interest rates cuts are crucial. Dovish signals (indicating potential rate cuts) are generally positive for the gold price . Inflation Outlook The Fed’s view on inflation is critical. If the minutes suggest concerns about low inflation, it strengthens the case for rate cuts, potentially lifting the gold price . Economic Assessment The overall economic outlook presented in the minutes can influence market sentiment. A cautious or pessimistic outlook might increase safe-haven demand for gold. Vote Split The minutes reveal the level of consensus among FOMC members. A strong dovish leaning, even with some dissent, can still be interpreted as a positive signal for gold. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly’s recent comments highlight the delicate balancing act the Fed faces. She suggested holding steady on interest rates until there’s clearer progress towards the 2% inflation target. This underscores the market’s intense focus on the FOMC minutes for further direction. Technical Outlook: Is the Gold Price Poised for a Breakout? From a technical standpoint, the current consolidation in the gold price can be seen as a bullish continuation pattern. Despite the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hinting at overbought conditions, the overall setup favors further upside. Key Technical Levels to Watch: Resistance : The immediate hurdle remains the $2,940-$2,942 zone, the all-time high. A decisive break above this level could trigger a significant bullish move in the gold price . Support : On the downside, immediate support lies around $2,925, followed by $2,900 and the $2,878-$2,876 range. These levels are expected to cushion any corrective pullbacks. While some profit-taking might lead to temporary dips, the underlying bullish momentum suggests that buyers are likely to step in on any weakness. The path of least resistance for the gold price appears to be upward, especially if the FOMC minutes reinforce dovish expectations. Navigating the Gold Price : What’s Next? As we await the FOMC minutes , traders are in a holding pattern. The release is scheduled for today at 19:00 GMT and is expected to inject fresh volatility into the market. Key takeaways for gold traders: Monitor the USD : The USD ‘s reaction to the FOMC minutes will be crucial. A weaker USD is generally supportive of higher gold prices. Analyze the Tone : Pay close attention to the overall tone of the minutes. A dovish stance on interest rates is likely to be bullish for gold. Watch Technical Levels : Keep an eye on the key support and resistance levels mentioned earlier to anticipate potential breakouts or breakdowns in the gold price . Conclusion: Will FOMC Minutes Spark the Next Gold Rush? The gold price is delicately poised, awaiting a catalyst to determine its next major move. The FOMC minutes release is that potential catalyst. If the minutes reveal a Fed leaning towards further interest rates cuts, we could witness a powerful surge in the gold price , potentially pushing it into uncharted territory. Conversely, hawkish signals could trigger a temporary pullback. Buckle up, because volatility is on the horizon for gold!

While Bitcoin and Ethereum grab headlines, traditional currencies are making moves too. The Pound Sterling just delivered a powerful performance in the Forex market, surging after a surprisingly hot UK inflation report. Is this a fleeting spike or the start of a sustained rally? Let’s dive into the details and see what this means for the broader financial landscape. Why is the Pound Sterling Gaining Strength? Unpacking the UK Inflation Surge The primary driver behind the Pound Sterling’s recent gains is the release of the latest UK inflation data. January’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers came in hotter than anticipated, signaling persistent price pressures in the UK economy. Here’s a breakdown of the key figures: Headline CPI (Year-on-Year): Rose by 3%, exceeding the 2.8% forecast and December’s 2.5%. This indicates a significant acceleration in the overall inflation rate. Core CPI (Year-on-Year): Increased by 3.7%, matching expectations but still higher than the previous 3.2%. Core inflation strips out volatile components, suggesting underlying inflationary pressures are robust. Headline CPI (Month-on-Month): Deflated by 0.1%, less than the expected 0.3% deflation. This points to sticky inflation even on a monthly basis. Services Sector Inflation: A closely watched metric by the Bank of England (BoE), jumped to 5% from 4.4% in December. This is particularly concerning as services inflation tends to be more persistent. These figures paint a picture of an economy where inflation is proving more stubborn than anticipated. For Forex traders, this immediately translates to potential action from the Bank of England, which in turn impacts the value of the Pound Sterling. Bank of England’s Balancing Act: Inflation vs. Economic Slowdown The Bank of England (BoE) finds itself in a tricky situation. While the latest UK Inflation report is concerning, the central bank has previously indicated that it expects short-term inflation upticks due to energy price fluctuations. Governor Andrew Bailey recently stated that he doesn’t believe the inflation increase will be “persistent” and anticipates a “gradual disinflation” trend to continue. He also highlighted the “sluggish state” of the UK economy, which could naturally act as a brake on inflation. However, hotter-than-expected inflation data limits the BoE’s room for maneuver. Further monetary easing, such as interest rate cuts, becomes less likely in the face of rising prices. This anticipation of a less dovish BoE is a key factor supporting the Pound Sterling’s strength in the Forex market. Trump’s Tariff Threats: A Wildcard in the Forex Arena Adding another layer of complexity to the Forex News landscape is the return of trade war anxieties. Former US President Trump has threatened to impose substantial 25% tariffs on imports of automobiles, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals. This move has the potential to: Strengthen the US Dollar: Tariffs can be seen as inflationary in the US, potentially leading to a more hawkish Federal Reserve and a stronger dollar. Slow Global Economic Growth: Trade wars disrupt global supply chains and dampen economic activity, creating uncertainty in financial markets. Impact Currency Valuations: Changes in trade dynamics can shift currency valuations as investors react to evolving economic and political landscapes. While the immediate focus is on the UK Inflation and its impact on the Pound Sterling, Trump’s tariff threats are a significant risk factor that could influence broader Forex market sentiment and potentially impact GBP/USD and other currency pairs. GBP/USD Technical Outlook: Riding the Bullish Wave From a technical analysis perspective, the Pound Sterling appears to be gaining momentum against the US Dollar (GBP/USD). Here are some key technical points: Breaching Resistance: GBP/USD has broken above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, coinciding with the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) around 1.2620. This suggests a shift in momentum towards the upside. RSI Momentum: The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is above 60.00, indicating growing bullish momentum. Sustaining above this level would further reinforce the upward trend. Support and Resistance Levels: Key support lies at the February 3 low of 1.2250. On the upside, the 50% Fibonacci retracement at 1.2767 represents a significant resistance level. The technical picture suggests that the Pound Sterling could continue its upward trajectory against the US Dollar, at least in the short term, as long as the bullish momentum persists and key resistance levels are overcome. Understanding the Pound Sterling: A Quick Forex Primer For those new to Forex News and currency trading, here’s a quick overview of the Pound Sterling (GBP): Aspect Details Official Currency of United Kingdom Currency Code GBP Nickname (GBP/USD) Cable Nickname (GBP/JPY) Dragon Issued by Bank of England (BoE) Global Ranking (FX Trading) 4th most traded currency The value of the Pound Sterling is heavily influenced by the Bank of England’s monetary policy decisions, particularly interest rate adjustments. Economic data releases, such as GDP, PMIs, employment figures, and the Trade Balance, also play a crucial role in shaping GBP’s value in the Forex market. A strong UK economy and hawkish BoE policies generally support a stronger Pound Sterling. In Conclusion: Pound Sterling’s Rally – A Sign of Things to Come? The Pound Sterling’s surge following the hot UK Inflation report is a significant event in the Forex market . It highlights the ongoing battle against inflation faced by central banks globally and the immediate currency reactions to economic data. While the Bank of England remains cautiously optimistic about long-term disinflation, the near-term reality of sticky inflation is providing a boost to the Pound. Keep a close eye on upcoming UK Retail Sales and PMI data, as well as any further pronouncements from the Bank of England, to gauge the sustainability of this Pound Sterling rally. And remember, global events like potential trade wars can always inject volatility into the Forex arena.

Recent analysis from ING suggests a broad weakening of the EUR, particularly against the US Dollar. This alarming trend is attributed to a mix of factors, from geopolitical uncertainties to shifting global economic policies. Let’s delve into the details and understand what this means for the forex market and potentially, your investments. Why is the Euro (EUR) Under Pressure? According to ING’s FX analysts, the recent rise in the German ZEW index, initially seen as a positive sign, might be misleading. Francesco Pesole from ING points out that this optimism may stem from anticipation of a government change rather than a genuine improvement in growth sentiment. This underlying fragility in sentiment is a key factor contributing to the currency weakening of the Euro. Here’s a breakdown of the factors driving the EUR downwards: Geopolitical Tensions: The ongoing Russia-US talks are heavily influencing the Euro’s trajectory. Any hint of escalation or prolonged uncertainty tends to weigh negatively on European currencies. Trump Factor: The potential for a more transactional approach from the US towards European NATO allies, especially under a Trump administration, is introducing a significant risk premium. This perceived threat is exacerbating the Euro’s vulnerability. Fair Value Model: ING’s short-term fair value model indicates that EUR/USD currently shows zero risk premium. This essentially means the pair is not undervalued, leaving it susceptible to further downside pressure, especially if US protectionism risks are repriced into the FX market. EUR/USD : How Low Can It Go? The million-dollar question for traders and investors alike is: how far can this currency weakening push the EUR/USD pair? ING analysts suggest a potential correction down to 1.040 this week. This projection is based on the anticipation of increased market sensitivity to US protectionist policies and the broader geopolitical landscape. Consider these points regarding the EUR/USD outlook: Downside Risks: The absence of a risk premium in the current EUR/USD valuation signals that the path of least resistance might be downwards. 1.040 Target: ING’s target of 1.040 is not just a random number; it represents a level where the market might re-evaluate the balance of risks and potentially find a temporary bottom. Volatility Ahead: Expect increased volatility in the EUR/USD pair as markets react to news flow concerning US policy and geopolitical developments. What Does This Mean for You? Understanding the drivers behind the Euro’s weakness is crucial for anyone involved in forex trading or international finance. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on geopolitical news, especially updates on Russia-US relations and any signals regarding US trade policy. Risk Management: Given the potential for further downside in EUR/USD , prudent risk management is essential. Consider adjusting your positions and using stop-loss orders to protect your capital. Diversification: If you hold significant Euro-denominated assets, consider diversification strategies to mitigate the impact of potential further currency weakening . Is This the End for the Euro? While the current outlook for the Euro appears bearish, it’s important to remember that currency markets are dynamic and influenced by a multitude of factors. The currency weakening trend highlighted by ING is a significant warning sign, but not necessarily a prediction of a complete collapse. Market sentiment can shift rapidly, and economic data releases, central bank policies, and unexpected global events can all play a role in altering the Euro’s course.

EUR/USD could potentially decline to 1.040 in the near term. Traders should exercise caution and stay informed about market developments. In conclusion, the Euro’s current predicament warrants close attention. While the situation is fluid, the analysis from ING provides valuable insights into the potential downside risks and key factors influencing the currency weakening .

40568509,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131163,1740023175,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Unfazed GBP: UK Inflation Rebound Not Concerning, Says ING",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/unfazed-gbp-uk-inflation-ing/,"Cryptocurrency markets are closely watching traditional financial indicators for signals that could influence broader market sentiment. Today’s UK inflation data release and ING’s analysis offer valuable insights into the resilience of the British Pound (GBP) and potential future monetary policy, which can indirectly impact crypto investment strategies. Decoding the UK Inflation Data: Is the Rebound a Concern? This morning’s release of January’s UK inflation data initially caused a stir, but leading financial institution ING suggests there’s no cause for alarm. The headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) saw an acceleration to 3.0%, slightly exceeding forecasts. However, ING’s FX analysts, led by Francesco Pesole, point out that this uptick is largely attributed to an unexpected surge in food prices. Crucially, markets appear to be echoing this sentiment, with minimal reaction in the pound’s value. Let’s break down the key components of the inflation data: Headline CPI: Increased to 3.0%, slightly above the predicted 2.8-2.9%. Food Prices: The primary driver of the unexpected inflation increase in January. Services Inflation: Came in marginally lower than anticipated at 5.0%. Core Services Inflation (Excluding Volatile Items & Rents): Showed a positive trend, decreasing to 4.2% from 4.7% over the past two months. The seemingly concerning headline figure is being offset by more nuanced data points, particularly the encouraging trend in core services inflation. This suggests that underlying inflationary pressures might be easing, despite the headline GBP Inflation number. ING Analysis: Why the Inflation Rebound is Deemed ‘Not Concerning’ ING’s assessment hinges on the details beneath the surface of the UK inflation data . They highlight two critical factors that lead them to believe the rebound is not a significant threat: One-Off Factors: The surge in food prices is considered an isolated incident rather than a systemic inflationary pressure. Benign Core Services Inflation: The steady improvement in core services inflation, as measured by ING, indicates a more controlled inflationary environment than the headline figure suggests. Furthermore, ING clarifies the service inflation figures, noting that December’s data was artificially suppressed due to measurement issues with Christmas airfares. Adjusting for this, the underlying trend in services inflation is less alarming than initially perceived. Rate Cut Forecasts Maintained: What This Means for GBP Perhaps the most significant takeaway from ING’s analysis is their continued projection of rate cut forecasts . Despite the inflation uptick, they maintain their expectation of one rate cut per quarter throughout the year. This conviction is underpinned by their belief that the benign trend in services inflation will persist into the second quarter. For GBP, this implies a potentially less hawkish stance from the Bank of England than some might have anticipated based solely on the headline inflation number. If ING’s forecasts prove accurate, it could limit upside potential for the pound in the medium term. EUR/GBP Outlook: Eyes on the 0.820 Level ING’s analysis extends to the EUR/GBP pair, noting a recent break below the 0.8300 level. They attribute the euro’s underperformance to “idiosyncratic” factors, potentially linked to the EU’s geopolitical positioning relative to the US. While cautious about calling a bottom for the pair, ING suggests a move towards 0.820 is “not out of scope.” In the longer term, ING believes that the GBP curve is due for dovish repricing, which should eventually offer some support to EUR/GBP. However, in the short term, the euro’s weakness may persist. Actionable Insights for Crypto and Forex Traders While this analysis focuses on traditional Forex markets, there are crucial takeaways for cryptocurrency traders and investors: Monitor Global Macro Trends: Inflation data and central bank reactions in major economies like the UK can indirectly influence global market sentiment, including crypto markets. Diversification and Risk Management: Understanding Forex market dynamics can inform diversification strategies and risk management approaches in crypto portfolios. Stay Informed on Economic Analysis: Institutions like ING provide valuable macroeconomic insights. Keeping abreast of such analyses can enhance your understanding of broader market forces. EUR/GBP as a Sentiment Indicator: Movements in currency pairs like EUR/GBP can sometimes reflect broader risk appetite and geopolitical sentiment, which can have spillover effects into crypto markets. Conclusion: Steady as She Goes for GBP? ING’s calm assessment of the latest UK inflation data suggests a steady outlook for the GBP, despite the headline rebound. Their analysis emphasizes the importance of looking beyond surface-level numbers and understanding the underlying trends. For traders in both traditional and cryptocurrency markets, this report serves as a reminder that nuanced economic analysis is crucial for informed decision-making, and knee-jerk reactions to headline figures can be misleading.

He opened up about the strong recovery of America’s economy since his election, citing significant improvements since November 5th. The Nasdaq has risen nearly 10%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 2,200 points, and Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs. Trump expressed his goal of making America the leading hub for cryptocurrency, aiming to keep the country at the forefront of the industry. “Bitcoin set multiple all-time record highs because everyone knows that I’m committed to making America the crypto capital,” he said. He added, “We want to stay at the forefront of everything, and one of them is crypto, and Miami seems to be the center of the action, come to think of it, and maybe it’ll stay there.” Criticism of the SEC and Its Stance on Crypto Trump also took the opportunity to criticize the SEC under the Biden administration, particularly former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who left the agency last month. Trump stated, “We ended that war totally,” referring to the SEC’s stance on crypto. He added that the SEC had been hostile toward the industry until the very end, but with so many people invested in Bitcoin and crypto, they changed their tone, becoming “very nice” just before Gensler’s departure. Before and since taking office, Trump has shown strong support for digital assets. He appointed crypto-friendly former regulator Paul Atkins to lead the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Trump’s recent remarks come amid various developments in the crypto world, including Elon Musk-led DOGE’s investigation against the SEC.

A recent community vote on Binance Square, Binance Exchange’s social platform, showcased an impressive 86.2% support for the potential listing. This significant show of community enthusiasm raises crucial questions about the future of Pi Network and Binance’s listing decisions. Let’s dive into the details of this exciting development and explore what it could mean for the crypto landscape. Decoding the Binance Community Vote on Pi Network Listing Binance Square recently hosted a community vote to gauge user sentiment regarding the potential listing of Pi Network’s PI token. The vote, which commenced on February 17th, saw an impressive turnout, with 69,706 users participating as of February 17th at 23:59 (UTC). The results are compelling: Participation: A substantial 69,706 Binance users cast their votes. Overwhelming Support: A striking 86.2% of voters expressed their support for listing Pi Network (PI). Vote Duration: The vote remains open until February 27th, 23:59 (UTC), suggesting the final support percentage could potentially shift, although a major change from 86.2% seems unlikely. Platform: The vote was conducted on Binance Square, highlighting Binance’s engagement with its community through its social platform. This data clearly indicates a strong desire within the Binance community to see PI listed on the exchange. The sheer volume of votes and the overwhelming percentage in favor underscores the community’s interest in Pi Network. But what exactly does this vote mean in the grand scheme of crypto listings? Why is this Community Vote for Crypto Listing Significant? Community votes, especially on major platforms like Binance Square, carry significant weight in the cryptocurrency world. They serve as a direct channel for users to express their preferences and influence exchange decisions. Here’s why this vote for a Pi Network crypto listing is noteworthy: Community Sentiment Indicator: The vote provides Binance with invaluable insight into the community’s appetite for PI. An 86.2% approval rating is a powerful signal of user interest and potential trading volume. Demand Validation: It validates the demand for Pi Network within the Binance ecosystem. This can be a crucial factor for Binance when considering new listings, as exchanges prioritize assets that are likely to attract users and trading activity. Decentralized Influence: Community votes exemplify the decentralized ethos of crypto, where users have a voice and can potentially influence the direction of major platforms. Marketing and Awareness: The vote itself generates buzz and awareness around Pi Network and its potential listing on Binance. This increased visibility can benefit both Pi Network and Binance. However, it’s crucial to understand the limitations and context of this vote. Binance has explicitly stated that the vote results are for reference only and do not guarantee a listing. This brings us to the next important question. Does a High Vote Percentage Guarantee a Pi Network Crypto Exchange Listing on Binance? While the 86.2% support is undeniably impressive, it’s essential to manage expectations. Binance’s official announcement clearly states that the vote is for “reference only.” This means several factors come into play when Binance makes a listing decision, and community vote is just one of them. Let’s consider the factors Binance likely weighs: Factor Description Relevance to Pi Network Listing Project Fundamentals Binance thoroughly assesses the project’s technology, whitepaper, team, roadmap, and overall viability. Binance will scrutinize Pi Network’s technology, its consensus mechanism, utility, and long-term vision. Tokenomics Token distribution, supply, demand, and economic model are crucial for a healthy market. Pi Network’s tokenomics, including its mining and distribution model, will be under review. Compliance and Legal Regulatory compliance and legal aspects are paramount for Binance to avoid risks. Binance will assess Pi Network’s compliance with global and regional regulations. Security The security of the network and smart contracts is vital to protect user funds. Binance will evaluate Pi Network’s security infrastructure and protocols. Community and Adoption (Already Demonstrated) A strong and active community indicates user interest and potential for growth. The community vote already highlights strong community support for Pi Network. Trading Volume Potential Exchanges benefit from high trading volumes, generating fees and liquidity. Binance will analyze the potential trading volume of PI, considering the community interest. As you can see, while community support is a positive signal, Binance’s decision-making process is multifaceted and rigorous. A high vote percentage certainly strengthens Pi Network’s case, but it’s not the sole determinant. What is Pi Network and Why the Excitement for a Crypto Exchange Listing? For those unfamiliar, Pi Network is a cryptocurrency project designed to be mined on mobile phones. It aims to make crypto mining accessible to everyone, moving away from the energy-intensive models of traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The excitement surrounding a potential crypto exchange listing stems from several factors: Mainstream Accessibility: Pi Network aims to bring cryptocurrency to a broader audience through mobile mining, making it more user-friendly and accessible than some other cryptocurrencies. Large User Base: Pi Network boasts a significant user base, often referred to as “Pioneers,” who have been mining PI through the mobile app. A listing would provide these users with a way to potentially trade and realize value from their mined PI. Ecosystem Development: A listing on a major exchange like Binance could accelerate the development of the Pi Network ecosystem, attracting developers, partnerships, and further adoption. Price Discovery: Currently, PI is not traded on major exchanges. A listing would enable price discovery, allowing the market to determine the value of PI. However, Pi Network has also faced scrutiny and discussions within the crypto community regarding its network structure, token distribution, and the fact that the mined PI is not yet tradable. A Binance listing would be a significant step towards addressing some of these concerns and validating the project in the eyes of many. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Pi Network and Binance? The Binance community vote has undoubtedly put Pi Network in the spotlight. While we await Binance’s final decision, here’s what we can expect and consider: Continued Community Engagement: The Pi Network community is likely to remain highly engaged, hoping for a positive listing decision from Binance. Binance’s Deliberation: Binance will now carefully consider the vote results alongside its own due diligence process, evaluating all the factors mentioned earlier. Market Speculation: The crypto market will likely see increased speculation and discussion around Pi Network’s potential Binance listing. Potential Listing (or Not): Ultimately, Binance will announce its decision. A listing would be a major win for Pi Network and its community, while a non-listing would necessitate further development and community building for Pi Network to pursue future exchange opportunities. In conclusion, the Binance community vote emphatically demonstrates a strong desire for Pi Network’s PI token to be listed on the exchange. This surge in community demand is a powerful signal, but it’s just one piece of the puzzle in Binance’s listing evaluation process. The crypto world watches with bated breath to see if this overwhelming community support will translate into a Binance listing for Pi Network, marking a potentially exciting chapter for both projects.

This jolt comes directly after the release of unexpectedly high UK inflation data, injecting a fresh wave of volatility and opportunity into currency trading. Are you ready to dive into the details of how UK inflation is currently shaping the Pound’s trajectory and what it means for your trades? UK Inflation Data Sparks Pound Sterling Gains The Pound Sterling is currently enjoying renewed interest from investors, spurred by the latest UK inflation report for January. The data revealed a hotter-than-anticipated rise in consumer prices, exceeding forecasts and shaking up market expectations. Let’s break down the key figures: Headline CPI Soars: The headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) jumped to 3% year-on-year, surpassing both the anticipated 2.8% and the previous month’s 2.5%. This unexpected surge signals stronger inflationary pressures within the UK economy. Core CPI Meets Expectations: The core CPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy, aligned with expectations at 3.7% year-on-year, slightly up from the previous 3.2%. While expected, this figure still points to persistent underlying inflation. Month-on-Month Deflation Slows: Monthly headline CPI deflation was a slower 0.1% compared to the 0.3% in December, and against economists’ expectations of 0.3% deflation. This suggests that the cooling of inflation is not happening as rapidly as anticipated. Services Sector Inflation Accelerates: A critical metric for the Bank of England (BoE), inflation in the services sector, climbed to 5% from 4.4% in December. This acceleration is particularly concerning for the BoE as it reflects domestically generated price pressures. This hotter-than-expected inflation data has led to immediate reactions in the Forex market , with the Pound Sterling gaining ground against several major currencies. The table below illustrates the Pound’s performance against its peers: Currency USD EUR GBP JPY CAD AUD NZD CHF USD 0.07% -0.08% -0.23% 0.03% -0.13% -0.45% 0.16% EUR -0.07% -0.15% -0.29% -0.04% -0.20% -0.50% 0.09% GBP 0.08% 0.15% -0.15% 0.12% -0.05% -0.35% 0.24% JPY 0.23% 0.29% 0.15% 0.24% 0.07% -0.25% 0.36% CAD -0.03% 0.04% -0.12% -0.24% -0.17% -0.47% 0.12% AUD 0.13% 0.20% 0.05% -0.07% 0.17% -0.30% 0.29% NZD 0.45% 0.50% 0.35% 0.25% 0.47% 0.30% 0.60% CHF -0.16% -0.09% -0.24% -0.36% -0.12% -0.29% -0.60% Table: British Pound (GBP) percentage change against major currencies. BoE’s Stance Amidst Rising UK Inflation Despite the concerning inflation figures, the Bank of England (BoE) maintains a somewhat dovish outlook. BoE Governor Andrew Bailey has previously indicated that while inflation might see a temporary increase due to energy price fluctuations, he believes this uptick will not be persistent. He continues to foresee a “gradual disinflation going on” and emphasizes the “sluggish state” of the UK economy as a factor that will naturally counteract inflationary pressures. However, the recent inflation data could present a challenge to the BoE’s forward guidance. Key considerations for traders and investors include: Limited Monetary Easing: The rise in UK inflation might restrict the BoE’s capacity for further monetary easing. Markets will be keenly watching for any shift in the BoE’s rhetoric. Data Dependency: Future monetary policy decisions will heavily rely on upcoming economic data. Keep an eye on the UK Retail Sales for January and the preliminary S&P Global/CIPS Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for February, due Friday. Global Economic Factors: External factors, such as potential tariff implementations by the US, could also influence the UK’s economic outlook and, consequently, the BoE’s policy decisions. GBP/USD Technical Outlook: Holding Key Levels From a technical analysis perspective, the GBP/USD pair is navigating crucial levels. Currently trading above 1.2600, the pair is testing resistance around the 1.2620 mark, coinciding with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement and the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Key technical points to watch: Support: The February 3 low of 1.2250 remains a significant support level. Resistance: The 50% Fibonacci retracement at 1.2767 presents a key resistance zone on the upside. RSI Momentum: The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is above 60.00, suggesting building bullish momentum. Sustaining above this level could signal further upward potential for the GBP/USD. Trump’s Tariff Threats: A Wildcard in the Forex Market Adding another layer of complexity to the Forex market landscape are renewed tariff threats from former US President Donald Trump. His recent statements about imposing a 25% tariff on automobiles, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals have reintroduced trade war anxieties. This development could have several implications: USD Strength: Historically, tariff threats have sometimes led to a strengthening of the US Dollar as investors seek safe-haven assets. Global Economic Slowdown: Widespread tariffs could trigger a slowdown in global trade and economic growth, impacting various currencies, including the Pound Sterling. Market Volatility: Such geopolitical uncertainties tend to increase volatility across financial markets, presenting both risks and opportunities for traders. Navigating the Pound Sterling and UK Inflation Landscape The latest UK inflation data has undeniably injected a dose of excitement into the Pound Sterling and the broader Forex market . While the immediate reaction has been positive for the Pound, the sustainability of these gains hinges on a multitude of factors, including the BoE’s future policy moves, upcoming economic data, and global economic developments. For traders, staying informed, adapting to evolving market conditions, and employing robust risk management strategies will be paramount in navigating this dynamic environment.

The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, and with it comes innovative ways to participate in this burgeoning market. If you’ve been looking for a regulated and accessible route to gain exposure to a diverse basket of cryptocurrencies, then you need to pay attention. Leading asset manager WisdomTree has just dropped a game-changer at Consensus Hong Kong 2025 – the WisdomTree Physical CoinDesk 20 ETP (WCRP). Let’s dive into what this means for you and the future of crypto investment. What is the Buzz About the WisdomTree ETP? Think of Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) as similar to ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds). They are investment vehicles that track the performance of an underlying index, sector, or asset class and trade on stock exchanges just like stocks. WisdomTree, a well-established asset manager, is bringing this familiar concept to the crypto world with its new WisdomTree ETP . But this isn’t just any crypto ETP; it’s linked to the CoinDesk 20 Index, a benchmark index representing a significant portion of the digital asset market. Imagine having a single investment that gives you exposure to a range of top cryptocurrencies, much like how an S&P 500 ETF gives you exposure to the top 500 US companies. That’s essentially what the WCRP aims to achieve for the digital asset space. Decoding the CoinDesk 20 Index: Your Gateway to the Crypto Market The heart of the WCRP lies in the CoinDesk 20 Index . But what exactly is this index, and why is it significant? Broad Market Representation: The CoinDesk 20 Index is designed to measure the performance of the largest and most liquid digital assets. It’s not just about Bitcoin; it encompasses a diverse selection of cryptocurrencies that meet specific eligibility criteria. Rigorous Selection Process: CoinDesk Indices employs a rules-based methodology to construct and maintain the CoinDesk 20. This means the index isn’t arbitrarily put together; it follows clear, transparent rules for inclusion and exclusion of digital assets. Market Capitalization Weighted: Similar to many traditional market indices, the CoinDesk 20 is market capitalization-weighted. This means that cryptocurrencies with larger market caps have a greater influence on the index’s performance. Regular Review and Rebalancing: To ensure the index remains relevant and accurately reflects the market, CoinDesk 20 is periodically reviewed and rebalanced. This keeps the index aligned with the evolving digital asset landscape. By tracking the CoinDesk 20 Index, the WisdomTree Physical CoinDesk 20 ETP provides investors with a snapshot of the broader crypto market’s performance, beyond just individual coins. Why Choose a Crypto ETP for Digital Asset Investment? Investing in cryptocurrencies can seem daunting. Directly buying and managing digital assets involves navigating exchanges, wallets, and security concerns. This is where crypto ETP products like WCRP come into play, offering several potential advantages: Benefit Description Accessibility ETPs trade on regulated stock exchanges, making them easily accessible to a wide range of investors through their existing brokerage accounts. No need to set up crypto wallets or learn complex exchange interfaces. Regulation and Security ETPs operate within established regulatory frameworks, offering a level of investor protection not always present in the direct crypto market. They are also custodied by regulated financial institutions, reducing security risks associated with self-custody of digital assets. Diversification The WCRP, linked to the CoinDesk 20 Index, inherently provides diversification across a basket of leading digital assets. This can help mitigate the risk associated with investing in single cryptocurrencies. Familiar Investment Structure For investors already familiar with traditional ETPs or ETFs, crypto ETPs offer a comfortable and understandable investment structure. It bridges the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world. However, it’s crucial to remember that while ETPs offer advantages, they are still investments and come with risks. The value of digital assets can be highly volatile, and investors should be prepared for potential fluctuations in the value of their digital asset investment . ETP Launch: Expanding Access to Crypto Across Europe The ETP launch of WisdomTree Physical CoinDesk 20 (WCRP) is significant not just for the product itself, but also for its accessibility. WisdomTree has strategically listed the WCRP on major European exchanges: Deutsche Börse Xetra (Germany) Swiss Stock Exchange SIX (Switzerland) Euronext Paris (France) Euronext Amsterdam (Netherlands) This broad listing across key European markets signifies a growing appetite for regulated crypto investment products and makes WCRP readily available to a large investor base in Europe. It also highlights the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets as a legitimate asset class. Navigating Digital Asset Investment with WisdomTree ETP: Is it for You? So, who might find the WisdomTree Physical CoinDesk 20 ETP appealing? Investors Seeking Diversified Crypto Exposure: If you want to invest in crypto but are hesitant to pick individual coins, WCRP offers a diversified approach through the CoinDesk 20 Index. Traditional Investors Entering Crypto: For those familiar with stock market investing and ETPs, this product provides a comfortable and regulated entry point into the digital asset space. Long-Term Crypto Believers: If you have a long-term bullish outlook on the crypto market, WCRP allows you to participate in the potential growth of the broader digital asset ecosystem without the complexities of direct crypto ownership. Actionable Insights: Do Your Research: Understand the CoinDesk 20 Index, the methodology behind it, and the risks associated with digital asset investment before investing in WCRP. Consider Your Risk Tolerance: Crypto investments are inherently volatile. Assess your risk appetite and ensure WCRP aligns with your overall investment strategy. Consult a Financial Advisor: If you’re unsure whether WCRP is right for you, seek advice from a qualified financial advisor who can assess your individual financial situation and investment goals. Conclusion: A Smart Step Towards Mainstream Crypto Investment WisdomTree’s launch of the Physical CoinDesk 20 ETP (WCRP) is a significant step forward in making digital asset investment more accessible and regulated. By linking to the well-regarded CoinDesk 20 Index and listing on major European exchanges, WisdomTree is providing a smart and familiar route for investors to tap into the potential of the crypto market.

While the crypto market is filled with thousands of options, only a select few have the potential to achieve exponential growth. Projects that combine real-world use cases, community engagement, and technological advancements stand the best chance of skyrocketing in value. In this guide, we explore the top crypto coins for 1000x ROI, starting with Web3Bay, which is revolutionizing online shopping security with blockchain technology. 1. Web3Bay (WBAY) – Blockchain-Powered Online Shopping Solution Online shopping faces significant issues, including scams, fake reviews, and chargeback fraud, making both buyers and sellers vulnerable. Web3Bay addresses these challenges with its blockchain-based escrow system, ensuring transactions are transparent, secure, and dispute-free. Payments are held in escrow until all conditions are met, eliminating fraudulent listings and chargeback fraud. For small business owners, this system minimizes losses from false claims and disputes, while shoppers gain confidence by purchasing from verified sellers. Additionally, blockchain immutability prevents fake reviews, ensuring trustworthy product ratings. This shift from traditional e-commerce creates a safer and more reliable marketplace. Web3Bay’s presale is gaining momentum, having raised $1.4 million in stage 4 at a batch price of $0.004562625. With over 300 billion coins sold, demand continues to grow as users recognize the need for secure digital transactions. Given its potential to redefine online shopping security, Web3Bay stands out as a prime candidate for massive gains and 1000x ROI potential. 2. Filecoin (FIL) – Decentralized Storage Powerhouse As Web3 adoption accelerates, decentralized storage solutions are becoming essential. Filecoin leads this sector by offering a distributed data storage network that enhances security and accessibility. Unlike centralized cloud storage providers, Filecoin ensures users retain control over their data while incentivizing storage providers. With major tech companies exploring blockchain solutions, Filecoin’s demand is expected to rise. If institutional adoption increases, FIL’s value could skyrocket, making it a strong contender for exponential growth and a possible 1000x ROI in the long run. 3. Dogecoin (DOGE) – Potential ETF Catalyst & Musk’s Endorsement Dogecoin remains one of the most well-known meme coins, but its influence extends beyond internet culture. With speculation around a potential DOGE ETF and continuous backing from Elon Musk, Dogecoin could see a resurgence in value. Musk’s integration of Dogecoin into Tesla’s payment system and potential future use in X (formerly Twitter) adds to its utility. If mainstream adoption gains traction, DOGE could defy expectations and deliver substantial gains, possibly reaching 1000x ROI for early investors. 4. Bonk (BONK) – Solana’s Meme Coin with Strong Community Bonk has emerged as a leading meme coin within the Solana ecosystem, benefiting from low transaction fees and high-speed transfers. Unlike many speculative tokens, Bonk’s developers are actively integrating real-world utility, such as DeFi applications and NFT projects. With an engaged community and expanding use cases, Bonk has the potential to replicate past meme coin rallies, offering early investors significant upside if momentum continues. If the right catalysts align, BONK could be among the few tokens with 1000x ROI potential. 5. Floki (FLOKI) – Expanding DeFi & NFT Ecosystem Floki is positioning itself as more than just a meme coin, focusing on DeFi, NFTs, and metaverse applications. Its developers are pushing for widespread adoption through strategic partnerships and community-driven initiatives. Floki’s recent integrations with various DeFi platforms and NFT marketplaces signal long-term potential. If adoption accelerates, Floki could become one of the biggest meme coins to deliver outsized gains and potentially offer 1000x ROI to those who invest early. Summing Up Investing in crypto carries risk, but selecting coins with strong fundamentals and growing adoption increases the likelihood of high returns. Web3Bay leads this list due to its real-world utility in securing online transactions, followed by established projects like Filecoin, Dogecoin, Bonk, and Floki. As the crypto market evolves, these projects have the potential to generate substantial returns for investors seeking 1000x ROI opportunities.

Do it, and you’ll go to prison.” The Coinbase CEO made the statement on X (formerly Twitter) today, addressing the meme coin frenzy that has taken over the market. Brian said he isn’t against meme coins, but he’s calling out those taking it too far—trading on inside information, rigging launches, and scamming retail investors. His warning comes after Hayden Davis, the self-proclaimed “launch strategist” behind multiple political meme coins, admitted to market manipulation, insider trading, and sniper wallets in an interview with Coffeezilla on Saturday. Hayden launched $LIBRA, the Argentinian meme token that wiped $4.6 billion from the market in hours. “This is an insiders’ game. It’s an unregulated casino,” Hayden said. He detailed how the elites get in early, manipulating prices before dumping on retail investors. He even admitted that some insiders received access to Trump’s token at a private dinner in Washington, D.C., before the public launch. Hayden seemed almost indifferent to the damage. “I thought some of these meme coins could turn into something real,” he said. “But the reality is, it’s just a game. The people who know how to play win. The rest lose.” Brian says meme coins still deserve their flowers Brian addressed the meme coin explosion, acknowledging that while some tokens are “silly, offensive, or even fraudulent”, they’re an inevitable part of crypto’s evolution. “Meme coins have been with us since the beginning – Dogecoin is still one of the most popular coins. Even Bitcoin is somewhat of a memecoin (one could argue so is the U.S. dollar, once it was disconnected from gold),” Brian said. He compared meme coins to the early internet, where pointless animated GIFs eventually became part of something much bigger. “New technologies often look like a toy but evolve into something much more powerful over time,” wrote Brian. Coinbase, he said, believes in free market capitalism. If a token is legal and customers want to trade it, they should be allowed to make that choice. But he made one thing clear: “Some meme coins have clearly gone too far lately, to the extent people are insider trading. This is illegal, and people should understand that you will go to prison for this.” Brian added that: “Don’t break the law! And don’t try to get rich quick. You should get rich by contributing real lasting value to society (or at least be trying – it’s not easy!).” Cryptopolitan Academy: Are You Making These Web3 Resume Mistakes? - Find Out Here",News|Coinbase,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-20 04:00:16

While established cryptocurrencies often capture headlines, seasoned analysts argue that lesser-known projects can deliver exponential returns. One expert has singled out PCHAIN as a hidden gem, going so far as to label it the best altcoin for those aiming to achieve million-dollar portfolios by 2025. This altcoin stands out by blending real-world applications with significant upside potential, pushing it to the forefront of altcoins set to disrupt traditional markets. The Growing Appetite for the Best Altcoin to Become a Millionaire As the digital asset space evolves, savvy traders are moving beyond the usual suspects in hopes of finding the best altcoin to eclipse mainstream coins in terms of profitability. Prices of major tokens often follow predictable patterns, causing some investors to miss out on extreme growth. According to this expert’s report, PCHAIN is the best altcoin to deliver game-changing results thanks to its innovative approach to real estate, AI, and metaverse functionalities. In the quest for the best altcoin to become a millionaire, many are switching focus to ecosystems like PCHAIN, which has already raised over $2 million in its presale. The token sells at $0.011 in round two, set to climb to $0.023 in the third round. The eventual listing at $0.032 promises an 800% return for early adopters, an enticing proposition for those eyeing the best altcoin in the current market. Blockchain-based real estate solutions make PCHAIN particularly appealing. Traditional property investment often carries high entry barriers, leaving countless would-be investors locked out. By tokenizing ownership, this altcoin bridges crypto innovation and tangible assets, a model that could transform entire industries. The expert’s assessment suggests that if PCHAIN maintains development momentum and garners further public attention, it stands a strong chance of securing its place among the best altcoins by 2025. Why PCHAIN’s Real Estate Innovation Positions It as the Best Altcoin PCHAIN sets itself apart by reshaping how we perceive real-world asset investing, chiefly real estate. The project employs fractional ownership and tokenization to let people acquire portions of high-value holdings with minimal upfront capital. Rather than spending millions to purchase farmland or office buildings, participants can buy smaller shares through PCHAIN tokens. For instance, a $10 million farmland can be divided into 10,000 tokens, priced at $1,000 each. This approach solves long-standing accessibility issues, making PCHAIN a prime candidate for those searching for the best altcoin to become a millionaire. The built-in AI can autonomously execute trades when certain conditions arise, such as growing demand for short-term rentals. This hands-off approach caters to individuals who lack the time or expertise to constantly monitor market shifts, reinforcing why many believe PCHAIN is the best altcoin for strong returns. A metaverse component further amplifies PCHAIN’s appeal by enabling virtual property tours. Instead of traveling overseas, buyers can walk through farmland or office buildings using immersive 3D technology, inspecting locations for design features and local amenities. This functionality breaks down geographical barriers, connecting global investors in real-time. Combined with an automated transaction system run by audited smart contracts, PCHAIN significantly reduces friction in property investing. All revenue disbursements, whether from rent, leasing, or crop sales, are handled by transparent code, with results publicly verifiable. With robust technological underpinnings and a focus on bridging crypto with tangible assets, PCHAIN positions itself as a formidable altcoin in a crowded marketplace. According to the expert, these real-world utilities might drive PCHAIN to outperform more speculative coins, securing its place as the best altcoin for substantial future gains. PCHAIN: The Altcoin Poised to Create Millionaires Through Real Estate and AI Innovation Identifying the best altcoin to become a millionaire has always been challenging, given the relentless pace of crypto innovation. Yet experts remain confident that PCHAIN might fulfill that role by 2025. Its approach to tokenizing real estate, integrating AI analytics, and hosting immersive metaverse tours means it could attract both crypto veterans and newcomers intrigued by income-producing assets. The ongoing presale underscores market enthusiasm, as the project has already secured more than $2 million and offers compelling potential for further growth. PCHAIN stands out as a practical solution in a sea of theoretical ideas, a factor that differentiates it from other contenders for the title of best altcoin. Fractional property ownership and automated transactions simplify the investment experience, allowing everyday individuals to participate in high-value sectors once exclusive to major players. Should property listings expand, user adoption widens, and AI functionalities continue to evolve, PCHAIN might become the altcoin that surpasses early expectations. Security is addressed through extensive auditing. PCHAIN uses smart contracts scrutinized by BlockAudit , ensuring reliable performance. Its listing on CoinMarketCap enhances credibility, while the official website provides a detailed roadmap and real-time updates. For many observers, the token’s upward trajectory from $0.011 in the second round to a possible $0.032 listing signals more than just short-term profitability. It hints at a transformative ecosystem that could redefine real estate’s global reach. If PCHAIN achieves its full vision, the market stands to gain a highly valuable altcoin capable of sustained growth. Investors seeking the best altcoin to become a millionaire may find their answer in this project, as its hybrid blend of real-world impact, advanced technology, and robust community support places it in a prime position for success.

40568992,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131183,1740024116,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Exclusive Insights: Robinhood Reveals Secure Crypto Listing Process Amid Memecoin Frenzy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/secure-crypto-listings-robinhood/,"In the ever-turbulent world of cryptocurrency, where new digital assets emerge daily and memecoins capture fleeting internet fame, some platforms are prioritizing stability and security over rapid expansion. Robinhood, a popular investment and trading platform, is firmly planting its flag in the ground, emphasizing a strict crypto listing process . Johann Kerbrat, Robinhood’s Vice President and General Manager of Crypto, recently shed light on the company’s meticulous approach at Consensus Hong Kong 2025, signaling a commitment to quality over quantity in their digital asset offerings. This revelation comes at a crucial time, as the crypto market grapples with volatility and the persistent allure of speculative memecoins. Let’s dive into what makes Robinhood’s strategy stand out and what it means for the future of crypto investment. What Makes Robinhood’s Crypto Listing Process So Strict? Robinhood currently supports 22 crypto assets, a relatively small number compared to some exchanges boasting hundreds, if not thousands, of listings. Kerbrat’s statements at Consensus Hong Kong underscore that this isn’t a matter of capability, but rather a conscious choice driven by stringent evaluation criteria. According to Odaily’s report, the core pillars of Robinhood’s crypto listing process are: Security First: This isn’t just a buzzword for Robinhood. Security is paramount. They meticulously assess the security infrastructure of each potential crypto asset to protect users from vulnerabilities and potential exploits. This includes evaluating the underlying blockchain technology, smart contract audits, and the overall security practices of the project team. Liquidity Assurance: Beyond security, liquidity is a critical factor. Robinhood ensures that listed assets have sufficient trading volume and market depth. This is crucial for users to be able to buy and sell assets efficiently and at fair prices, minimizing slippage and ensuring a smooth trading experience. These two factors – security and liquidity – form the bedrock of Robinhood’s decision-making. It’s a calculated approach that prioritizes user safety and market integrity over simply chasing listing numbers. Why Focus on Crypto Security and Liquidity? In the volatile crypto landscape, the emphasis on crypto security and liquidity is not just prudent, it’s essential. Let’s break down why these aspects are so critical: Factor Importance Impact on Users Security Protects against hacks, exploits, and theft. Ensures the integrity of user funds and data. Safeguards investments and personal information. Builds trust in the platform and the listed assets. Liquidity Enables smooth and efficient trading. Reduces price volatility and slippage. Allows users to buy and sell assets quickly at desired prices. Provides a stable and reliable trading environment. Ignoring these fundamental aspects can lead to significant risks for investors. Platforms that rush to list assets without proper due diligence may expose their users to: Security Breaches: Vulnerable smart contracts or blockchain networks can be exploited, leading to loss of funds. Market Manipulation: Illiquid markets are more susceptible to manipulation, where large players can easily sway prices to the detriment of smaller investors. Rug Pulls and Scams: Lack of thorough vetting can allow fraudulent projects to get listed, leading to devastating losses for unsuspecting users. Robinhood’s cautious approach is a deliberate countermeasure to these risks, aiming to create a safer and more reliable environment for crypto trading. Memecoin Hype vs. Real Crypto Adoption: Where Does Robinhood Stand? Kerbrat directly addressed the elephant in the room – memecoins. He acknowledged their ability to generate significant buzz and community discussion. However, he astutely pointed out that the crypto narrative shouldn’t be solely dominated by fleeting trends. There’s a broader, more substantial story unfolding in the crypto space, one that involves the increasing Ethereum Solana adoption and the robust institutional interest in stablecoins. While memecoins capture headlines with their viral nature and potential for quick gains (and equally rapid losses), Kerbrat emphasizes the importance of recognizing the underlying technological advancements and real-world applications driving crypto adoption. Assets like Ethereum and Solana are not just speculative tokens; they are platforms enabling decentralized applications (dApps), powering NFTs, and facilitating the growth of Web3. Their value proposition extends far beyond internet memes and social media trends. Furthermore, the “strong institutional demand for stablecoins” highlights a crucial aspect of crypto maturity. Stablecoins, pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, provide a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world. Institutional investors, often seeking stability and regulated exposure, are increasingly turning to stablecoins as a gateway into the digital asset market. This institutional interest signals a deeper, more sustainable form of crypto adoption beyond the retail-driven frenzy around memecoins. Robinhood’s Crypto Asset Selection: A Curated Approach While Robinhood hasn’t explicitly disclosed the entire list of its 22 supported cryptocurrencies in this context, their selective approach is evident. By prioritizing Robinhood crypto listing of assets that meet stringent security and liquidity criteria, they are curating a portfolio focused on established and fundamentally sound projects.

The SEC’s filing, which was made public today, states that it is withdrawing the appeal under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 42(b). Both sides have agreed that each party will bear its own costs, with the plaintiffs — including the Blockchain Association — not opposing the motion. The SEC had initially appealed a district court ruling from November 2024, which had favored the plaintiffs and criticized the agency’s rulemaking as overreaching. The rule in question had raised concerns across the crypto industry, as it potentially threatened to stifle innovation and disrupt the growth of digital assets by imposing unnecessary regulations on digital asset dealers. The Blockchain Association had argued that the SEC’s actions were harmful to the industry, claiming the agency’s stance amounted to unjustified regulatory overreach. 1/ Today marks a complete victory for us – and the broader industry – in our lawsuit against the SEC over the dealer rule.

40569150,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131221,1740024414,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Decoding DXY’s Subdued Trading: Is a Powerful Rebound Imminent?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/decoding-dxy-subdued-trading/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency and Forex trading, staying ahead of market movements is crucial. Today, we delve into the subdued trading of the US Dollar Index (DXY) , a key indicator for Forex traders globally. Despite a touch of firmness fueled by hawkish remarks from Federal Reserve officials, the DXY is experiencing a period of calm before potentially significant economic data releases. Let’s break down what’s happening and what it means for your trading strategy. Decoding the Subdued DXY Trading According to OCBC’s FX analyst Christopher Wong, the US Dollar Index is currently navigating a landscape shaped by ‘hawkish Fedspeaks.’ Several factors are contributing to this subdued yet potentially volatile environment: Hawkish Fed Rhetoric: Federal Reserve officials like Daly and Waller are signaling a cautious approach to monetary policy. Daly emphasized the need for restrictive policies until substantial progress on inflation is evident. Waller suggested holding rates steady until a clear decline in inflation, similar to the trends observed in 2024, is confirmed. Upcoming Economic Data: This week is packed with critical economic releases that could significantly influence the US Dollar Index . Traders are keenly awaiting: Housing Starts and Building Permits (today) FOMC Minutes (Thursday, 3 am SGT) Preliminary PMIs (Friday) Technical Indicators: Current technical analysis presents a mixed picture. Daily momentum is bearish, but there’s a moderation in the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Intriguingly, a potential bullish divergence on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is forming, hinting at a possible shift in momentum. Near-Term Rebound Risks and Key Levels for DXY While the current trading might be subdued, ruling out a near-term rebound for the US Dollar Index would be premature. Wong highlights critical resistance and support levels that traders should monitor closely: Level Type Level Significance Resistance 1 107.30 23.6% Fibonacci retracement Resistance 2 107.80 21-day Moving Average (DMA) Resistance 3 108.50 Support 106.20/40 100-day Moving Average (DMA), 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of October low to January high According to OCBC, ‘Better prints’ in the upcoming economic data could bolster the US Dollar’s rebound momentum. Traders should pay close attention to these levels as potential breakout or breakdown points. Trump’s Tariffs: A Muted Forex Reaction So Far Overnight, news broke regarding former President Trump’s announcement of potential tariffs. He stated intentions to impose a 25% tariff on autos, pharmaceuticals, and chips, effective April 2nd. This follows his earlier tariff of 25% on all steel and aluminum imports, set for March 12th. Interestingly, the Forex market reaction to these tariff announcements has been relatively muted. Analysts suggest this is because such measures were somewhat anticipated. However, the ‘bigger uncertainty’ revolves around potential reciprocal tariffs from other nations, details of which are expected to emerge later. These reciprocal tariffs could introduce more volatility into the Forex market and impact the US Dollar Index . Actionable Insights for Forex Traders What does this subdued trading and potential for rebound mean for Forex traders, especially those involved in cryptocurrency markets? Monitor Economic Data: The upcoming housing data, FOMC minutes, and PMIs are crucial. Better-than-expected figures could strengthen the US Dollar Index . Watch Key Levels: Keep a close eye on the resistance levels (107.30, 107.80, 108.50) and support levels (106.20/40) for potential trading opportunities. A break above resistance could signal a bullish move, while a break below support might indicate further downside. Stay Informed on Tariffs: While the initial reaction to Trump’s tariffs was muted, be prepared for potential volatility as details on reciprocal tariffs emerge. These could have a more significant impact on currency valuations. Consider Fed Stance: The Federal Reserve’s cautious and data-dependent approach means that economic data will play an even more critical role in shaping interest rates expectations and, consequently, the US Dollar Index . Conclusion: Navigating the DXY’s Subdued Phase The US Dollar Index is currently in a phase of subdued trading, influenced by hawkish Fed rhetoric and anticipation of key economic data releases. While daily momentum appears bearish, technical indicators hint at a potential bullish divergence, suggesting a possible rebound. Forex traders should remain vigilant, monitoring economic data, key technical levels, and developments regarding international trade policies to effectively navigate the market and capitalize on potential opportunities as the DXY finds its next direction.

However, fear is growing as Pi Coin has already plunged 55%, now trading around $30. This sudden drop has fueled speculation that the mainnet launch could lead to further bigger drop ahead. Profit-Taking Opportunity for Early Miners One of the biggest risks for Pi coin comes from early miners. These miners have accumulated Pi tokens at little to no cost, and are likely to view the mainnet launch as their first real opportunity to monetize their holdings. For these individuals, selling a portion of their tokens could be a strategic move to lock in profits, especially if they believe the initial market price will be higher due to hype and speculation. If a significant number of early miners decide to sell simultaneously, the market could experience a rapid increase in supply, potentially reducing the demand and this could lead to a sharp price decline. Market Trends and Technical Indicators Following the official announcement of the mainnet launch , the price of the Pi token jumped by almost 90%, climbing from $49 to $92. But this rise didn’t last long, as prices have fallen sharply since then. Meanwhile, technical signs also show that Pi’s price is struggling. The token recently fell below a key support level at $40, which had earlier helped keep the price stable. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures whether a token is overbought or oversold, recently entered the overbought zone for Pi. However, it quickly dropped in the last 24 hours. In the past, tokens that hit this zone often saw their prices reverse and fall. This could mean more price drops are coming for Pi. The Airdrop Effect: A Common Trend? History has shown that cryptocurrencies launched through airdrops often experience significant price declines. When tokens are distributed for free or at a low cost, many recipients rush to sell their holdings as soon as trading begins. Pi Network could follow a similar pattern, with an oversupply of tokens hitting the market and driving prices lower. Pi Price Hints Major Lose Ahead As of now PI, I owe you (IOU), price has seen a sharp decline, now trading at $32 after dropping 57% in just 24 hours. This crash happened after the token failed to stay above the $50 support level. With the upcoming mainnet launch, uncertainty is growing, and Pi’s price could face more downward pressure. While it is still holding above $30, breaking below this level might trigger a further drop to $17. If that happens, investors who have been holding Pi in recent weeks could face even bigger losses.",News,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|AIRDROP|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-20 04:11:43

In a thrilling announcement, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has just unveiled a comprehensive Hong Kong crypto roadmap , packed with 12 strategic initiatives designed to propel the cryptocurrency sector to new heights. For anyone watching the evolution of digital finance, this is a pivotal moment. Let’s dive into the details of this exciting plan and explore what it means for the future of crypto in Hong Kong and beyond. What’s Driving Hong Kong’s Crypto Ambition? Why is Hong Kong so keen on becoming a leading crypto center? Several factors are at play. Firstly, Hong Kong has historically been a major financial hub, and embracing crypto is seen as a natural progression to maintain its competitive edge in the evolving global financial landscape. Secondly, there’s a clear recognition of the immense potential of blockchain technology and digital assets to drive economic growth and innovation. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, there’s a strategic vision to attract global talent and investment into the region. This Hong Kong crypto roadmap is a clear signal to the world: Hong Kong is open for crypto business. Decoding the 12 Key Initiatives of the Hong Kong Crypto Roadmap The SFC’s plan isn’t just about broad strokes; it’s a detailed blueprint with concrete actions. Here’s a breakdown of some of the key initiatives: OTC Crypto Trading Licensing: Bringing over-the-counter (OTC) crypto trading platforms under a licensing regime. This is crucial for investor protection and market integrity, ensuring that these platforms operate under regulatory scrutiny. Custodial Services Licensing: Establishing clear licensing for crypto custodial services. Secure storage of digital assets is paramount, and regulated custodial services will build trust and confidence in the market. Exploring New Token Listings for Professionals: Expanding the range of tokens available for trading, initially focusing on professional investors. This phased approach allows for controlled growth while catering to sophisticated market participants. Reviewing Staking Regulations: Examining the regulatory landscape for crypto staking. Staking is a popular way to earn rewards in the crypto world, and clear rules are needed to foster responsible innovation in this area. Facilitating Crypto Derivatives Trading: Exploring the possibility of allowing regulated trading of crypto derivatives. Derivatives markets can enhance liquidity and offer sophisticated investment and hedging tools. Attracting Global Liquidity Providers: Actively working to bring in international liquidity providers to Hong Kong’s crypto market. Increased liquidity means tighter spreads and more efficient trading for everyone. These initiatives, among others, paint a picture of a comprehensive and forward-thinking approach. The Hong Kong crypto regulation framework is being carefully constructed to balance innovation with investor protection. Benefits of Hong Kong’s Pro-Crypto Stance What are the potential upsides of Hong Kong’s proactive approach to crypto? Economic Boost: A thriving crypto sector can attract significant investment, create jobs, and generate tax revenue for Hong Kong. Technological Innovation: By embracing crypto and blockchain, Hong Kong can become a hub for technological advancement and attract cutting-edge companies. Global Financial Leadership: Taking a leading position in the digital asset space reinforces Hong Kong’s status as a major international financial center. Investor Protection: Clear regulations and licensing regimes enhance investor confidence and reduce the risks associated with crypto investments. Increased Market Accessibility: Attracting liquidity providers and facilitating diverse trading options makes the market more accessible and efficient for participants. Challenges and Considerations for Hong Kong’s Crypto Journey Of course, navigating the crypto landscape isn’t without its challenges. Hong Kong will need to address several key considerations: Balancing Innovation and Regulation: Finding the right balance between fostering innovation and implementing robust regulations is crucial. Over-regulation could stifle growth, while insufficient regulation could lead to risks. Combating Financial Crime: Crypto’s pseudonymous nature can be exploited for illicit activities. Strong anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) measures are essential. Investor Education: Crypto is a complex and often volatile asset class. Educating investors about the risks and opportunities is vital for responsible market participation. Global Regulatory Coordination: Crypto is a global phenomenon, and international cooperation on regulation is important to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure consistent standards. Technological Infrastructure: Supporting the growth of the crypto sector requires robust technological infrastructure, including secure and scalable platforms. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? For crypto enthusiasts, investors, and businesses, the Hong Kong crypto roadmap presents significant opportunities: For Investors: Hong Kong’s regulated crypto environment could offer a safer and more accessible avenue for investing in digital assets, particularly for professional investors initially. Keep an eye on the new token listings and derivative products as they become available. For Crypto Businesses: Hong Kong is signaling that it’s open to crypto businesses. Companies looking for a regulated and supportive jurisdiction to operate in should consider Hong Kong as a prime location. For Global Talent: The growth of the crypto sector in Hong Kong will create new job opportunities in technology, finance, and regulation. Professionals with crypto expertise should explore career prospects in the region. Hong Kong: A Rising Star in the Crypto Galaxy? Hong Kong’s unveiling of its comprehensive SFC crypto initiatives marks a significant step towards becoming a leading global crypto hub. By focusing on regulatory clarity, innovation, and market growth, Hong Kong is positioning itself to capitalize on the transformative potential of digital assets. While challenges remain, the commitment is clear, and the roadmap is ambitious. The world will be watching closely as Hong Kong embarks on this exciting journey, potentially setting a new benchmark for responsible and progressive crypto regulation globally.
