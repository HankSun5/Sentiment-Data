The Securities and Exchange Commission acknowledged WisdomTree’s bid to list and trade exchange-traded fund shares for an ( XRP ) trust. This acknowledgment initiates a 21-day public comment period, allowing the public to provide feedback on how the agency should approach WisdomTree’s application. Comment periods officially open after the SEC adds a filing to the Federal Register. Over the last few days, several prospective XRP ETF filings joined the Federal Register.

Bitcoin Demand Weakens, Increasing Price Correction Risks Bitcoin demand growth has weakened substantially. After a surge in November-December 2024, partly fueled by U.S. election results, demand has sharply declined from 279,000 on December 4, 2024 to just 70,000 today. This decline in demand is further reflected in ETF activity. Bitcoin ETF net inflows, which peaked at 18,000 BTC, have reversed to a net outflow of 1,000 BTC, signaling a pullback in investor confidence. Demand for Bitcoin from Spot ETFs is less than half of what it was at this point last year. Net inflows 2025: 41K Bitcoin 2024: 100K Bitcoin ETFs are simply not buying as much so far this year. pic.twitter.com/IjDGSRrvn9 — Julio Moreno (@jjcmoreno) February 19, 2025 CryptoQuant’s Inter-exchange Flow Pulse highlights declining spot Bitcoin demand in the U.S., as fewer BTC are moving from other exchanges to Coinbase. The metric recently fell below its 90-day moving average , suggesting reduced buying interest among both institutional and retail investors. This trend raises the likelihood of an extended price correction. CryptoQuant Data Shows Weak Liquidity Inflows from Stablecoins Despite stablecoins reaching a record $200 billion in total market capitalization, their expansion rate has decelerated sharply. The 60-day change in USDT’s market cap has dropped 92%, declining from $20.4 billion on December 16 to just $1.5 billion today. A recovery in stablecoin liquidity could play a key role in supporting Bitcoin’s price stability. Without a sustained influx of liquidity, Bitcoin may struggle to regain upward momentum. In addition to weak demand and slowing liquidity, Bitcoin network activity has fallen to its lowest level in a year, declining 17% since peaking in November 2024. CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin Network Activity Index has slipped below its 365-day moving average for the first time since July 2021, when China banned Bitcoin mining. This trend suggests reduced on-chain demand, reinforcing bearish conditions. With demand weakening, liquidity inflows slowing, and network activity declining, Bitcoin remains vulnerable to further price corrections unless a shift in market conditions reverses these trends. Investing in Uncertain Times As Bitcoin faces pressure on multiple fronts, the discussion invites readers to embrace reflective decision-making. The combination of subdued demand, tepid liquidity, and quiet network activity offers an opportunity to rethink one’s approach to digital investments . It raises a critical question: how should one manage exposure in a market characterized by continuous flux? Rather than chasing temporary optimism, this period calls for a disciplined appraisal of risk and potential. Each piece of market data contributes to a broader narrative, urging investors to craft strategies that are both measured and informed.

CryptoQuant data shows that $450M in USDT flowed into centralized exchanges, the highest level since February 3. Liquidity is flowing back to exchanges, with $450M deposited in the past 24 hours. The inflows are the highest since February 3. The net inflows show more stablecoins were moved to markets than were taken out. The recent spike in net inflows suggests a bigger market move may follow. The positive net flows follow a recent liquidity injection , where briefly as much as $2.7B in stablecoins entered the markets. This time, USDT was the more active stablecoin. Inflows of USDT and USDC may signal both bullish attitudes or the need to cover leveraged positions. Exchange inflows and outflows shift their direction more rapidly in the past few months, immediately responding to shifts in sentiment. The increased inflows followed a turbulent day for the crypto markets, where Bitcoin (BTC) hovered between the $95,000 and $97,000 range, while Solana (SOL) returned to levels from the end of 2024. The recent stablecoin inflows follow ongoing ‘buying the dip’ as more BTC is making its way into accumulation addresses . Stablecoins increase overall supply, remain top gas burners The exchange flows are reflecting the increased supply of top stablecoins. UDSC added 8.7B tokens in the past month, while USDT expanded its supply by 5.1B tokens. Stablecoins are already showing liquidity is waiting on the sidelines, with $226.8B available through leading dollar-denominated assets. The supply of all stablecoins increased by 7.79% in the past month, but the tokens stayed less active. Up to 30.3M addresses spent stablecoins, though the activity is down by 26.7% in the past month. The increased inflows suggest stablecoin holders may be reawakening. Tether’s smart contract remains the biggest gas burner for Ethereum. The recent supply injection follows increased gas usage in the past couple of days. USDT remains highly active on Ethereum, making use of the currently favorable transaction fees. Tether still burns over 5.1% of all gas on Ethereum. Circle’s USDC token has a less busy contract, with 2.53% of gas burns in a 24-hour period. Both USDT and USDC had some of their most active days on January 20 and February 3, showing stablecoins reacted immediately to market shifts and opportunities. Exchanges hold $42B in dry powder While exchange reserves for BTC and Ethereum (ETH) are near all-time lows, stablecoins have accumulated on most markets. The overall liquidity on exchanges increased in the past weeks, rising to $42.4B . The liquidity is not yet deployed, as trader behavior signaled ‘fear’ , based on the Bitcoin fear and greed index. Exchanges hold peak USDT reserves, though the biggest inflows went to derivative exchanges, most prominently Binance. | Source: Cryptoquant One of the curious changes for stablecoin usage is that spot exchanges have seen almost constant outflows. The big shift in dry powder is on derivative exchanges. Binance’s inflows were the steepest, as over $28B of the available liquidity is locked on the exchange. Bybit also saw a steep rise in stablecoin inflows, so far accumulating $3.1B. Smaller markets like Crypto.com have accrued $410M in available liquidity. Not all exchanges see the same available stablecoins for trading, and Binance may still lead during the next part of the cycle. Open interest is shifting downward for riskier stablecoins, while still remaining relatively low for blue chips like BTC and ETH. However, the available dry powder reveals a preparation for a shift in sentiment and for rebuilding leveraged positions. For now, not all of the liquidity is deployed, as traders are more cautious. However, the accumulation of stablecoins may not mean direct buying, but even more speculative trading in derivatives. The collection of simple spot exchanges holds a fraction of the available USDT liquidity.

Bitcoin, the flagship digital currency, is trading at $95,695, reflecting a slight uptick of 0.26% from its previous close. In tandem with these market movements, Hong Kong is actively bolstering its status as a regional digital assets hub. The Securities and Futures Commission has granted nine digital asset trading platform licenses, with eight more applications under review. This regulatory momentum is complemented by media expansion efforts, such as Elon Musk’s platform, X, launching its inaugural business news show, “From the Desk of Anthony Pompliano,” hosted by the renowned Bitcoin commentator. Amidst these developments, Qubetics ($TICS) emerges as a groundbreaking player, addressing real-world challenges that its predecessors have yet to tackle. By introducing a Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, Qubetics is poised to revolutionize how businesses, professionals, and individuals engage with blockchain and digital finance, offering solutions that are both innovative, practical and one of the top cryptos to hold for short term. Qubetics: Pioneering Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics isn’t just another name in the crypto space—it’s a game-changer. At its core lies the Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace , designed to bring traditional assets into the digital age, making ownership and investment more accessible than ever before. For businesses, this marketplace offers a novel way to raise capital. By tokenizing assets, companies can attract a global pool of investors, bypassing traditional financial intermediaries. This method streamlines fundraising, reduces costs, and accelerates project timelines. Individuals, regardless of their financial standing, gain the opportunity to diversify their investment portfolios. By owning tokens representing a share in various assets, they can hedge against market volatility and explore sectors previously inaccessible to them. As of now, Qubetics is in its 22nd presale stage, with the $TICS token priced at $0.08073. The presale has garnered significant attention, raising over $13.3 million from more than 20,500 token holders, with over 480 million $TICS tokens sold. Early investors are eyeing substantial returns, with potential ROI projections of up to 20,338% as the platform matures and gains traction in the market and becomes the Top Cryptos to Hold for Short Term. Bitcoin: The Digital Gold Standard Bitcoin (BTC) continues to dominate the cryptocurrency space. Currently trading at $95,695, it has seen a minor increase of 0.26% from the previous close. Despite a 14% decline since its all-time high in January, Bitcoin remains the ultimate digital asset for both new and seasoned investors. Bitcoin’s unwavering dominance in the cryptocurrency market is driven by several key factors. Market confidence remains a significant force, with Bitcoin’s market capitalization far exceeding that of any other cryptocurrency, solidifying its position as digital gold. Institutional adoption continues to grow, as major financial institutions integrate Bitcoin into their portfolios, reinforcing its stability and long-term potential. Additionally, regulatory developments in key financial hubs like Hong Kong are fostering broader cryptocurrency integration, potentially accelerating institutional adoption on a larger scale. These factors collectively ensure Bitcoin’s continued leadership in the digital asset space. Analysts remain bullish about Bitcoin’s future. Anthony Scaramucci, head of a leading crypto ETF, projects Bitcoin could reach $200,000 in 2025, citing U.S. reserves for Bitcoin as a driving force. His ETF reported a 74% return in 2024, driven by investments in key industry players like MicroStrategy and Coinbase. This performance follows its all-time high of $109,071 in January 2025, marking a 14% decline since that peak. Meanwhile, Monero, a prominent privacy-focused cryptocurrency, is priced at $236.09, showing a modest increase of 0.46% from its last close. Moreover, Bitcoin continues to gain mainstream attention. Elon Musk’s platform, X, recently launched a business news show featuring Anthony Pompliano, solidifying Bitcoin’s role in financial discourse reinforcing its position as one of the top cryptos to hold for short term. Monero: The Privacy Powerhouse Monero (XMR) is the go-to cryptocurrency for those who prioritize privacy. Currently priced at $236.09, it has recorded a modest 0.46% increase from its previous close. Monero’s unique attributes make it an invaluable asset in a world where financial privacy is under constant scrutiny. Key reasons why Monero remains a strong contender Unlike Bitcoin, Monero transactions are completely anonymous, making it impossible to trace sender and receiver details. Every XMR coin is identical to another, preventing blacklisting and censorship of specific coins. The Monero Research Lab continuously enhances the blockchain’s privacy features, ensuring it stays ahead of surveillance tactics and one of the top cryptos to hold for short term. Despite its advantages, Monero has faced regulatory challenges. In late 2024, Kraken delisted Monero in Europe due to increasing scrutiny on privacy coins. However, the project’s community remains steadfast, working on solutions to ensure Monero remains accessible worldwide. Conclusion: The Best Cryptos to Hold for Short-Term Gains Whether it’s Bitcoin’s unwavering dominance, Monero’s privacy-centric approach, or Qubetics’ groundbreaking asset tokenization, each of these cryptocurrencies offers unique advantages. While Bitcoin provides a solid store of value and Monero ensures financial privacy, Qubetics is reshaping the landscape with its real-world asset tokenization. The opportunity to invest early in Qubetics’ presale is rapidly closing. With over $13.3 million raised and massive projected ROIs, $TICS stands as the most promising crypto for short-term gains. Those who recognize the potential now are setting themselves up for massive financial growth in the evolving digital economy. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics different from Bitcoin and Monero? Qubetics introduces real-world asset tokenization, allowing users to invest in tangible assets like real estate, fine art, and luxury goods, unlike Bitcoin and Monero, which primarily function as digital currencies. Why is Bitcoin considered the best store of value in crypto? Bitcoin’s limited supply, institutional adoption, and market dominance make it the most trusted cryptocurrency for storing value over time. How does Monero ensure privacy in digital transactions? Monero uses advanced cryptographic techniques like ring signatures and stealth addresses to conceal transaction details, ensuring complete financial privacy. What is real-world asset tokenization, and how does Qubetics implement it? Real-world asset tokenization involves converting tangible assets into digital tokens for fractional ownership. Qubetics enables this process through its blockchain-powered marketplace. Is Qubetics’ presale a good opportunity for short-term investors? Yes, with over $13.3 million raised and significant projected ROI, Qubetics offers a lucrative short-term investment opportunity before its presale ends.

Here’s what experts say,https://crypto.news/crypto-casino-meme-coins-hype/,"The crypto market is thriving, but meme coins dominate trading volumes. Are they fueling mass adoption or steering the industry toward a short-term, casino-like mentality? Experts weigh in. Table of Contents Hype, politics, and billions Are meme coins a liquidity drain or gateway to crypto? The role of platforms like Pump.fun Who’s responsible for the meme coins hype? Why do traders keep coming back? The LIBRE scandal and what comes next Hype, politics, and billions Meme coins are no longer a fringe element of the crypto market — they’ve become its driving force, fueling an era of speculation, volatility, and cultural transformation. Platforms like Pump.fun , a Solana ( SOL ) based launchpad, have made it easier than ever for anyone to create and trade meme tokens instantly, establishing themselves as the epicenter of viral token launches. Since its debut in January 2024, Pump.fun has facilitated the creation of over six million meme coins, the vast majority serving no purpose beyond speculation. The craze has even spilled into political circles, intertwining finance, hype, and governance. In Argentina, President Javier Milei faced backlash over his alleged endorsement of the LIBRA meme coin, a token that soared and then collapsed within hours, leaving retail investors nursing heavy losses. The fallout sparked a political firestorm, with opposition leaders demanding his impeachment. Meanwhile, in the U.S., just days before his inauguration, Donald Trump’s own meme coin — named Official Trump ( TRUMP ) — experienced a meteoric rise , reaching a $15 billion market cap before retreating to $3.35 billion as of Feb. 19. Adding to the spectacle, Melania Trump also launched her own token, Melania Meme ( MELANIA ), which also attracted billions in trading volume. With retail traders pouring billions into assets often devoid of fundamental utility, crypto.news reached out to industry experts to assess whether meme coins are draining liquidity and stifling innovation, or are they onboarding a new wave of investors into digital assets? Let’s dive into the debate. Are meme coins a liquidity drain or gateway to crypto? A key argument in favor of meme coins is their ability to attract fresh capital and onboard users who might not have engaged with crypto otherwise. Unlike technical blockchain projects, meme coins don’t require an understanding of staking mechanisms, interoperability, or smart contract security. Instead, their appeal lies in simplicity — catchy branding, viral marketing, and a low barrier to entry. Daria Morgen, Head of Research at Changelly, rejects the idea that meme coins are starving serious projects of liquidity. She argues that the traders flocking to these tokens wouldn’t necessarily be investing in blockchain protocols in the first place. “Many start with meme coins but eventually explore more serious projects. I don’t think meme coins necessarily divert liquidity. While some people might leave crypto altogether, most meme coin traders wouldn’t have invested in blockchain projects anyway — or they already hold assets like BTC or SOL. It’s a free market, and it’s up to utility-driven projects to attract liquidity and build their audience.” However, others argue that meme coins aren’t just absorbing retail cash but also altering broader market dynamics, making it harder for legitimate projects to gain traction. Tobin Kuo, CEO of Seraph Studios, has experienced this shift firsthand. His company develops AAA blockchain-based role-playing games, where players can own in-game assets as NFTs and earn rewards through gameplay. But with traders chasing quick profits in meme coins, long-term projects like his are struggling to maintain engagement. “For those of us building in GameFi, this is a challenging time. Players are spending less time engaging with in-game economies, and the kind of success seen during the Axie Infinity era isn’t easily replicable in today’s ‘fast in, fast out’ trading environment. My team and I are constantly adapting, looking for ways to reintroduce deeper engagement and sustainable incentives for players.” His point reflects a growing trend in crypto. In previous cycles, speculation often centred on emerging sectors like DeFi or play-to-earn gaming. Now, much of that speculative liquidity is flowing into meme coins, leaving projects that rely on sustained participation struggling to build engaged communities. Jessica Zheng, CEO of Cycle Network, sees both sides of the debate. While she acknowledges that meme coins bring retail engagement, she also notes a growing short-term mindset that has made the industry feel increasingly hype-driven rather than focused on real development. “The meme coin boom initially started as a pushback against big capital controlling the market — a way for grassroots communities to express their frustration and take a stand. Early on, successful meme coins actually had positive external effects, drawing in Web2 users and sparking interest in Web3. But as the market has matured, meme coins have also revealed major issues. The short-term gains have attracted a lot of people who see crypto as a quick cash grab, making the industry feel more short-sighted and less focused on sustainable growth.” This shift toward short-termism is precisely what concerns Georgii Verbitskii, Founder of TYMIO. He argues that meme coins have delayed the broader market’s transition into a true altcoin bull run. “The meme coin mania has drained market liquidity. We’re seeing thousands of new meme coins launch daily, siphoning capital away from more mature tokens, DeFi protocols, and altcoins with real utility. Many investors now prefer meme coins over sound investments, which is why fundamentally strong altcoins and protocols are getting less attention.” The role of platforms like Pump.fun Meme coins wouldn’t have reached their current scale without the rise of frictionless token launchpads. Platforms like Pump.fun have fundamentally changed the game, allowing anyone—regardless of technical expertise — to create and launch a token in seconds. At first glance, this kind of innovation aligns with the ethos of decentralization — open access, low barriers to entry, and a financial system free from traditional gatekeepers. But in practice, it has also fueled an unprecedented flood of speculative tokens. The question is whether these platforms are expanding financial opportunity or enabling unsustainable, Ponzi-like cycles that erode trust in crypto. Morgen sees both sides of the argument. While she acknowledges that platforms like Pump.fun lower entry barriers, she warns that their ease of use has also made it easier for bad actors to exploit retail traders. “While platforms like this foster creativity and make token launches more accessible, they also contribute to an oversaturation of low-quality assets. This environment enables pump-and-dump schemes, making them easier to execute. Such practices can erode trust in the crypto market and push away legitimate investors.” That erosion of trust is already playing out. Retail traders, lured by the promise of quick gains, often find themselves on the losing end of highly manipulated cycles. Some meme coins launched through platforms like Pump.fun see their entire liquidity drained within hours — early adopters walk away with profits, while most buyers are left holding tokens that collapse to near-zero value. Kuo takes an even harsher stance, arguing that these platforms have shifted the core narrative of crypto from innovation to gambling. “Honestly, trust in crypto isn’t exactly at an all-time high, and with the way things are going, even industry veterans joke about the space turning into the world’s largest casino. New entrants aren’t here for decentralization or blockchain innovation — they’re just chasing money, nothing else.” Zheng acknowledges the role of open-access launch platforms but warns that an influx of low-quality tokens isn’t sustainable. “It depends on how you look at it. Zero-barrier launchpads can act as catalysts, speeding up token creation and helping promising ideas gain exposure. In that sense, they create opportunities. But a catalyst only accelerates things — it doesn’t change fundamentals. If a project lacks real value from the start, launching it faster doesn’t make it sustainable. It’s still just empty hype.” Hence, the issue isn’t the existence of these platforms—it’s how they’re being used. The problem arises when these tokens are marketed purely as speculative bets, often promoted by influencers who pump them to their followers before cashing out. Who’s responsible for the meme coins hype? From social media figures hyping new tokens to exchanges listing them for a quick volume boost, multiple industry players profit from the speculation surrounding these assets. But when retail traders lose money — often on manipulated or rug-pulled tokens — who bears the responsibility? Morgen acknowledges the free-market nature of crypto but believes platforms and influencers must act responsibly. “The crypto market has always been about DYOR. It’s a free market — meme coins will come and go, and banning them isn’t realistic. Education is key to helping traders spot scams and rug pulls. However, platforms and influencers do share some responsibility. Promoting shady projects for quick gains may drive short-term profits, but it kills trust and drives users away over time.” Kuo, however, argues that the market isn’t truly free when those with the loudest voices manipulate it. “Everyone plays a role in this, and yes, this is how the market works. But calling it a ‘free market’ is a stretch when so much of the content is driven by paid promotions and, in many cases, outright manipulation.” His point highlights a growing concern — many meme coin traders don’t base decisions on independent research but on what’s trending on X, YouTube, or Telegram. The overwhelming influence of promoters, particularly influencers shilling projects for personal gain, makes it difficult for retail traders to assess real risks. Zheng takes a more neutral stance, acknowledging the influence of platforms and influencers while pointing to their responsibility. “Exchanges and influencers shape market sentiment, and while the market is technically free, many retail traders — especially newcomers — can be swayed by their narratives without fully understanding the risks. That can lead to losses. Influential figures and platforms have a responsibility to stay neutral and objective when sharing their views. They shouldn’t just chase engagement at the expense of retail investors.” Mori Xu, co-founder of Tabi Chain, sees the issue as one of balance. While many traders take reckless bets, he believes self-regulation within the industry could help curb the worst excesses. “Influencers and platforms should take some responsibility for the content they promote. They should provide clear risk disclosures and avoid misleading investors.” Verbitskii, meanwhile, sees the cycle of hype and loss as self-correcting. He argues that painful lessons will eventually shift market behavior. “The only thing that will slow it down is painful losses. When enough people get burned, fewer will jump in blindly. That’s the nature of market cycles.” Why do traders keep coming back? Meme coins have crashed countless times. Every cycle, a handful skyrocket, creating overnight millionaires, only to collapse just as quickly, leaving a trail of losses behind. Despite this predictable boom-and-bust pattern, traders keep diving back in, pouring billions into tokens that often have no real underlying value. At first glance, this behavior seems irrational. Why would investors willingly return to a market that has repeatedly burned them? Kuo compares meme coin speculation to the emotional trading patterns that have existed in traditional markets for centuries. “This is classic Bandwagon Effect psychology — something that has played out in stock markets for centuries. Investors buy assets simply because others are making money, often without fully understanding the fundamentals. This cycle has repeated itself in both stocks and crypto, and meme coins are no exception.” For example, stocks like GameStop (GME) and AMC experienced similar hype cycles during the retail trading frenzy of 2021. The difference is that in crypto, these cycles unfold much faster — sometimes within hours or days rather than months. Xu believes meme coins are driving a deeper shift in crypto, moving the market away from fundamentals-based investing and toward narrative-driven speculation. “Despite multiple crashes, traders keep chasing meme coins because of their high return potential, social media hype, and strong community influence. The excitement and FOMO around these tokens make them impossible to ignore.” Morgen offers a different perspective, arguing that crypto traders have always been split into two distinct camps — those seeking long-term stability and those embracing high-risk speculation. “It’s almost human nature to chase quick profits. There will always be risk-averse and risk-seeking investors: the former will hodl Bitcoin (or avoid crypto altogether), and the latter will gamble on meme coins. I don’t think there’s any real shift — crypto markets have always been like this.” The LIBRE scandal and what comes next The LIBRE scandal was a turning point in the debate over meme coin regulation. When the Argentine President was linked to the token, its price surged — only to collapse within hours, wiping out millions in investor funds. With meme coins now influencing global politics and financial markets, the question is no longer whether governments should intervene but how much regulation is too much. Kuo is sceptical that regulation will have any real impact. In his view, crypto is too decentralized for government restrictions to work effectively. “This is an interesting discussion, especially with the growing calls for KYC on meme coin launchpads. Some suggest that Pump.fun should require developers to verify their identities before launching tokens. But let’s be realistic. If you regulate Pump.fun, another platform will emerge to take its place. This cycle will repeat itself — just like how CEXs gave way to DEXs when regulations tightened.” Zheng takes a more measured stance. While she agrees that decentralization should be protected, she acknowledges that certain safeguards could help prevent market manipulation and retail losses. “The LIBRE scandal showed how easily meme coins — especially those with no real substance — can be manipulated by a small group of people, which isn’t good for the market. If nothing is done, a lot of retail investors could end up getting hurt.” Xu believes the solution lies in smart regulation — rules that protect investors without imposing excessive restrictions. “The LIBRE scandal highlighted how easily meme coins can be manipulated. I think governments should step in carefully. They have a role in protecting investors and maintaining market integrity, but overregulation could stifle the decentralized spirit of crypto.” The “smart regulation” approach aligns with what some countries are already exploring. Instead of outright banning meme coins, regulators could require disclosure rules, mandate influencers to reveal paid promotions, or enforce security audits for high-risk tokens. Meanwhile, Hedi Navazan, Chief Compliance Officer at 1inch Labs, argues that the lack of oversight makes meme coins particularly vulnerable to fraud, pump-and-dump cycles, and political misuse. “There are multiple risks in issuing meme coins, including market manipulation and the use of public figures to influence price movements in favor of their inner circle. Governance and structure are key. At the World Economic Forum in Davos 2025, meme coins became a major topic of discussion, with most experts expressing concerns over high-profile launches like Melania and Trump Coins. These moves could send the wrong message to the market, potentially leading to disappointment and raising doubts instead of showcasing blockchain’s real potential.” Verbitskii, meanwhile, believes the speculative frenzy is nearing its peak. While meme coins have absorbed much of the market’s liquidity, he argues their dominance may be short-lived. “I believe the peak of this meme coin mania is behind us. The release of the TRUMP token was likely the tipping point, so now it’s time for a cooling period. Many high-profile meme coins left buyers with heavy losses, which has created a negative perception of the market and could deter future investors.” However, history suggests this cooling-off period will be temporary. New narratives — whether political meme coins, celebrity-backed tokens, or AI-generated projects — will likely emerge, reviving speculation all over again. For now, crypto remains a wild west — where high risks, high rewards, and minimal oversight define the meme coin market. Whether governments step in or not, the next phase of crypto regulation will likely be shaped by how the industry responds to scandals like LIBRE and the political meme coin boom.",Feature|Exclusive|Crypto traders|gambling|Meme Coin|politics|rug pull,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-02-19 23:26:00

Despite billions in institutional inflows, the cryptocurrency has failed to break out significantly. A brief exception occurred on January 20, coinciding with U.S. President Donald Trump’s inauguration, when Bitcoin surged to an all-time high of $109,000 before swiftly retreating into its established range. Market Manipulation Suspicions Some industry leaders believe Bitcoin’s price stagnation may not be entirely organic. Samson Mow, CEO of Jan3 and founder of Pixelmatic, suspects deliberate price suppression. Speaking at Consensus Hong Kong 2025, Mow noted: “If you look at the price movement, we peak, and then we stay steady and chop sideways. It just looks very manufactured.” Mow further emphasized the unnatural nature of Bitcoin’s restricted price fluctuations, raising concerns about external forces shaping the market. ETF Inflows and Institutional Buying Fail to Move Price Despite steady accumulation by institutions and retail investors, Bitcoin’s price remains stagnant. Companies like Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy continue to buy Bitcoin in large quantities, yet the price refuses to budge. According to Mow, this suggests that substantial selling pressure is counteracting these inflows. “If Bitcoin’s price isn’t moving despite accumulation, then someone must be selling,” he explained. FTX Repayments and Potential Sell-Off Pressure Adding to market dynamics, FTX has begun repaying creditors, distributing over $1.2 billion based on Bitcoin’s November 2022 price of around $20,000. This could lead to increased selling pressure as recipients cash in on their gains. Mow pointed out that Bitcoin sales at mid-$20K levels are likely impacting market movements, preventing upward momentum. Despite these concerns, analysts remain optimistic, with 2025 price targets ranging between $160,000 and $180,000. However, for now, Bitcoin remains firmly within its controlled price range.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-19 23:31:00

The company, which until recently operated under the name MicroStrategy, targeted a 40%-50% conversion premium for the zero-coupon convertible notes maturing in 2030 at first, but the lowered stock volatility has forced a recalibration. Hedge funds and institutional investors, who often do complex trades involving bonds and short-selling Strategy shares, have been closely watching the deal. Bloomberg data shows that Strategy’s 30-day stock volatility has dropped to less than half of its December peak, reducing the opportunity for aggressive trading strategies tied to the company’s fluctuations. Strategy’s stock sheds value, but Bitcoin holdings surge Strategy’s stock has taken a 30% hit since November, pulling back from its record highs. Despite the dip, the stock remains up more than 700% over the past three years, driven by the company’s unstoppable Bitcoin acquisition strategy. As of press time, Strategy holds 478,740 Bitcoin, representing over 2.5% of the total Bitcoin supply, worth more than $45 billion at today’s prices. The company’s decision to focus on fixed-income securities and at-the-market stock sales is part of a plan to raise $42 billion by 2027 to continue accumulating Bitcoin. The convertible debt offering is Strategy’s first since raising over $560 million through a preferred stock sale at a big discount. Meanwhile, last Wednesday, Strategy reported its fourth consecutive quarterly loss, booking a $1.01 billion impairment charge tied to its Bitcoin holdings. This compares to just $39.2 million in impairment losses in the same period last year. The company’s net loss for the quarter hit $670.8 million, or $3.03 per share, a striking contrast to the $89.1 million profit recorded a year earlier. The massive write-down comes as Strategy prepares to adopt a new accounting rule in Q1, which will allow it to measure Bitcoin at fair market value instead of recognizing impairment losses when prices drop. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Kang said the fourth quarter will be the last when it recognizes an impairment charge on its bitcoin holdings. Despite its losses, Strategy purchased 218,887 Bitcoin in the last quarter alone, spending $20.5 billion in what is the largest Bitcoin acquisition in any quarter in its history. This brings Strategy’s total holdings to 471,107 Bitcoin as of February 2, with a market value of $46 billion. CEO Phong Le confirmed on the company’s post-earnings call that fixed-income issuance, including convertible bonds and preferred stock, will be a priority in 2025 as part of its plan to continue stacking Bitcoin.

Will LTC bulls hold out for a $250 breakout? Litecoin (LTC) Continues to Gain Momentum on ETF Hype Litecoin (LTC) has experienced considerable upside in February 2025, defying downward pressure from macroeconomic headwinds. Speculation surrounding altcoin ETF approvals has been a key factor in driving up LTC prices. Litecoin (LTC) Price Action This optimism was further reinforced after the SEC’s recent acknowledgment of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) ETF filings. As seen in the chart above, LTC price has reached a 40-day peak $136 on Feb. 19, rising by another 4% within the daily timeframe. The ETF narrative continues to fuel Litecoin’s rally, as investors anticipate increased liquidity and accessibility through regulated investment vehicles. Institutional Investors Enter $512M Buying Spree Ahead of ETF Launch Positive sentiment surrounding Litecoin ETF approvals has drawn significant institutional attention in recent days, propelling LTC to a new 40-day peak on Feb. 19. A closer look at on-chain data indicates that institutional investors have been aggressively accumulating LTC behind the scenes in anticipation of the ETF launch On-chain analytics from IntoTheBlock ’s Large Holder Netflow metric highlights a sustained accumulation trend among Litecoin’s largest whale addresses since the broader crypto market downturn began on Feb. 3, following Trump’s tariff announcement. This metric tracks net balance changes in wallets holding at least 0.1% of Litecoin’s total circulating supply, offering insight into whale activity during critical market phases. Litecoin Large Holder Netflow vs. LTC Price | Source: IntoTheBlock According to the data, Litecoin’s largest holders have maintained positive net inflows since Feb. 3. Over the past two weeks, these whale wallets have acquired a cumulative 4.68 million LTC, valued at approximately $512 million. Notably, Litecoin’s price has surged 42.3% since the buying spree began, climbing from lows of $98.42 on Feb. 4 to a 40-day peak of $136 on Feb. 19. Why Is Litecoin Price Going Up? Institutional accumulation suggests that major stakeholders are positioning ahead of a potential ETF approval. This level of sustained buying activity, despite broader market uncertainties, underscores the strategic interest in Litecoin among institutional players. The persistent buying spree among whales suggests that institutional and high-net-worth investors continue to build LTC positions as the probability of an ETF approval increases. A few factors could drive further institutional accumulation as the launch date approaches, including fulfilling reserve requirements, regulatory compliance, and portfolio diversification strategies. Institutional holders accumulating Litecoin may be looking to hold until the ETF is officially launched, capitalizing on the upside from euphoria. Likewise, OTC desks, aiming to provide operational services for brokers and exchanges listing Litecoin ETFs, could also extend their holding periods, reducing short-term circulating supply. Evidently, this narrative has played a crucial role in Litecoin’s 42% price surge over the past 14 days. If this accumulation trend continues, Litecoin’s price could extend its rally toward the highly anticipated $250 breakout level in the days ahead. LTC Price Forecast: $150 Breakout Could Trigger Further Upside Litecoin price forecast remains cautiously bullish as LTC approaches a critical resistance zone, bolstered by strong technical indicators. The recent rally has seen Litecoin climb 42.25% over the past 15 days, now trading at $135.90. This surge follows a bullish breakout from a consolidation phase, marked by a double-bottom reversal pattern. The upward trajectory has been accompanied by increasing trading volume, signaling strong market participation. Litecoin (LTC) Price Forecast The Bollinger Bands show widening volatility, with LTC now testing the upper resistance at $139.58. A decisive breakout above this level could open the door to the psychological $150 target. Parabolic SAR dots beneath the price further validate the bullish trend, suggesting sustained upward momentum. Meanwhile, the RSI at 62.46 remains below the overbought threshold, indicating room for further gains without immediate correction pressure. However, the bullish outlook faces risks. A failure to breach the $139.58 resistance could trigger a pullback toward the $117.19 mid-Bollinger level. If bearish pressure intensifies, Litecoin could revisit the Parabolic SAR support at $105.27. For now, maintaining price action above $130 keeps bulls in control, with $150 remaining a key upside target.

With the SEC’s acknowledgment , a three-week comment period has begun. This enables interested parties — investors, industry experts, and the general public — to submit comments on how the agency should assess WisdomTree’s proposal. The SEC will review these comments before determining whether to approve, reject, or postpone the application. Official comments will not start until a filing is posted in the Federal Register. Institutional interest in the XRP has recently increased significantly, as several XRP ETF applications have appeared in the Federal Register in recent weeks.

His tenure has marked a notable shift in regulatory approach, including the suspension of enforcement actions against major crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase. Uyeda has also led the creation of a new Crypto Task Force to produce a proposed framework for how the SEC will oversee digital assets. In addition, the political environment has enhanced institutional faith in crypto ETFs.

While regulatory clarity remains a concern, financial giants are positioning themselves for the next market cycle. The increasing demand for Ethereum signals confidence in its role within global finance. Meanwhile, an AI coin, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , currently priced at just $0.0420, is catching investors’ attention, promising innovation in its blockchain-powered artificial intelligence . As institutional players move strategically, these assets could define the next phase of crypto adoption. Big Banks Are Bullish On Ethereum And AI Coin Promising Exponential Gains In a significant shift within the financial sector, big banks increasingly embrace digital assets, with Ethereum and WallitIQ (WLTQ) emerging as focal points of interest. Recent data indicates that big banks’ investments in cryptocurrencies reached $17 billion in the first quarter of 2024, up from $13 billion during the same period in 2023. This surge underscores the growing confidence among big banks in the potential of blockchain technologies. Another notable development is Visa’s announcement of the Visa Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP), built on Ethereum. This platform enables Visa to issue and manage fiat-backed tokens, signaling a significant move toward crypto adoption. The initiative is set to pilot with Spanish multinational bank BBVA in 2025, highlighting the strategic interest of big banks in Ethereum’s capabilities. The convergence of big banks’ interest in Ethereum and the rise of AI coins reflects a broader trend of integrating advanced technologies into financial services. WallitIQ (WLTQ), a high-value AI coin, is leading the charge, with its presale boasting over $7 million in investments. This AI coin is attracting attention for its innovative applications, blending AI with blockchain to create decentralized solutions. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Feature-Rich Platform Gains Market Dominance Amid Institutional Adoption Reimagining crypto management, WallitIQ (WLTQ) ushers in a new era of control by introducing its feature-rich platform . This platform is a sophisticated yet intuitive wallet management system that allows users to organize their holdings. Supporting Ethereum and Tether (USDT), the recently announced app will enable users to view, track, and interact with their digital assets without the usual complexity. Sending and receiving crypto has never been easier. With WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) QR code generation for wallet addresses, the platform eliminates the hassle of manually copying and pasting long alphanumeric strings. This makes transactions quick, error-free, and secure. Investors can quickly transfer funds without worrying about losing their assets due to manual errors. WallitIQ (WLTQ) also introduces simulated transactions of ETH and USDT to external addresses, a feature that allows users to practice transactions without financial risk. Whether testing out wallet interactions or training for real-world usage, this feature provides an invaluable way to refine digital payment methods in a safe environment. Meanwhile, a key challenge for any investor is keeping up with price movements, and WallitIQ (WLTQ) confirms that users are always equipped with the latest data. Through CoinGecko API integration, real-time market tracking brings live pricing directly into the app, removing the need to switch between multiple platforms to check market trends. For a crypto platform like WallitIQ (WLTQ) , security is paramount, and this project has taken extensive measures to earn user trust. With a smart contract audit conducted by SolidProof , the platform has undergone rigorous security assessments to validate its integrity and reliability. This means investors can engage with the platform confidently, knowing that its infrastructure has been verified by one of the industry’s most respected auditing firms. Institutional Shift Strengthens Investor Confidence In WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Ongoing Presale Ethereum’s growing presence among institutional investors highlights its strengthening position in global finance. As big banks discreetly expand their ETH holdings, the market anticipates a shift that could drive long-term value. With blockchain technology reshaping industries, Ethereum, alongside an AI coin, remains at the forefront of decentralized applications and smart contract innovation. Meanwhile, the rising interest in AI-driven crypto projects , particularly an AI coin, underscores the sector’s evolving landscape. As institutional confidence in Ethereum solidifies, strategic investors closely watch Ethereum and this emerging AI coin.

While giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate, the real gains are often found in emerging projects that offer unique utility and high-growth potential. In 2025, a handful of standout cryptos are gaining traction, capturing the attention of both retail and institutional investors. Web3Bay is one such project, revolutionizing decentralized commerce with a marketplace free from middlemen, offering lower fees and seamless transactions. Alongside Web3Bay, XRP, Binance Coin (BNB), Near Protocol, and Tron are poised for significant gains, making them some of the most promising tokens to buy this year. Let’s break down why these five cryptos are set to skyrocket in 2025 and why Web3Bay is becoming a must-buy before its presale ends. 1. Web3Bay (3BAY) – The Future of Decentralized Commerce While most presales focus on speculation, Web3Bay delivers real-world utility, disrupting the trillion-dollar e-commerce sector. Unlike centralized platforms like Amazon and eBay, Web3Bay allows buyers and sellers to transact directly, reducing fees and eliminating third-party control. The project’s presale has already raised over $1.50 million, with 370 million tokens sold. Investors are flocking to 3BAY tokens, as the presale price of $0.00456 is expected to soar to $0.1959 upon launch, offering a massive 4,200% ROI for early adopters. Why Web3Bay is the Best Token to Buy in February: Decentralized Marketplace – No middlemen, lower fees, and full user control over transactions. Smart Contract Escrow – Secure, trustless transactions prevent fraud and disputes. Multi-Payment Support – Accepts both crypto and fiat payments (including PayPal). Staking Rewards – Earn passive income by holding 3BAY tokens. DAO Governance – Token holders have voting power, ensuring a community-driven ecosystem. With blockchain adoption growing, Web3Bay is set to be one of the most transformative investments of 2025. As the presale closes soon, this could be the last chance to get in before prices surge. 2. XRP (XRP) – The Cross-Border Payments Giant XRP has solidified its place as one of the most widely used digital assets in global finance, powering cross-border transactions through RippleNet. Designed to replace traditional banking systems, XRP offers faster, cheaper, and more efficient transactions than SWIFT. Recent legal victories against the SEC have reignited investor confidence, with analysts now predicting that XRP could hit $10 in this bull cycle. With ETF applications under review and institutional adoption rising, XRP’s trajectory is looking bullish. As more financial institutions adopt XRP for real-world payments, its demand is expected to surge, making it a top crypto to buy for long-term gains. 3. Binance Coin (BNB) – The Utility Powerhouse of the Binance Ecosystem Binance remains the largest cryptocurrency exchange globally, and BNB is the backbone of its ecosystem. Used for trading fee discounts, DeFi applications, and NFT transactions, BNB has immense utility and continuous demand. Binance Smart Chain (BSC) has also become a hub for DeFi and gaming projects, with billions in total value locked (TVL). As Binance expands regulatory compliance and institutional partnerships, BNB is set to be a major beneficiary. With staking rewards, DeFi integrations, and growing institutional use cases, BNB remains a top investment for long-term holders looking for stability and upside potential. 4. Near Protocol (NEAR) – The Ethereum Alternative for Fast, Low-Cost Transactions Near Protocol is emerging as a scalable alternative to Ethereum, offering high-speed transactions with minimal fees. Built for DeFi applications, NFT marketplaces, and smart contracts, NEAR’s ecosystem is rapidly expanding. With the introduction of Aurora, a Layer-2 scaling solution, NEAR now offers full Ethereum compatibility, allowing developers to migrate seamlessly. The protocol’s sharding technology ensures ultra-fast transaction processing, making it an attractive choice for developers and businesses. As blockchain adoption grows, NEAR’s efficiency and cost-effectiveness make it one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025, with potential for exponential growth. 5. Tron (TRX) – The Leader in Decentralized Finance and Digital Content Tron has positioned itself as a dominant force in DeFi, gaming, and digital content. With billions in total value locked (TVL), Tron’s ecosystem has attracted millions of users worldwide. From stablecoin transactions to DeFi lending platforms, Tron is a high-speed blockchain designed for scalability. Its low transaction fees and high throughput have made it a go-to network for developers and content creators. With more partnerships in gaming, NFTs, and Web3 applications, Tron’s ecosystem is only growing stronger. TRX remains a top investment for those looking to capitalize on DeFi and blockchain-based entertainment. Final Thoughts While established tokens like XRP, BNB, NEAR, and TRX offer strong investment potential, Web3Bay stands out as the most exciting opportunity of 2025. By reinventing e-commerce with blockchain technology, Web3Bay is tackling real-world inefficiencies, making it a high-utility token with massive upside potential. With over $1.50 million raised and presale prices set to surge, now is the best time to secure 3BAY tokens before launch. Investors looking for the next 100x opportunity in crypto should act fast—once Web3Bay hits major exchanges, early adopters could see life-changing returns. Will you wait for Web3Bay’s market debut or seize the opportunity before prices skyrocket? The choice is yours.

Chainlink price key levels are being monitored for critical support, BNB is surging, and BlockDAG’s presale is attracting attention with over $196 million raised and 18.5 billion BDAG coins distributed. Its FINALCALL700 bonus offers a 350% multiplier for early participants, a significant opportunity before BDAG’s launch. This combination of Chainlink price key levels, BNB’s surge, and BlockDAG’s presale success highlights the current market’s diverse opportunities. Let’s examine each development. Chainlink Price Key Levels in Focus Chainlink price key levels currently place $18 as a significant support area for LINK. The digital asset is currently trading around $18.53. A sustained presence above this level could propel LINK toward the $22-$25 range, a zone where it has previously seen gains. Conversely, if Chainlink price key levels break below $18, it could trigger caution among those watching the market, potentially leading to a decline towards $14. Historically, Chainlink’s upward movement has been hampered by periods of low trading volume. Chainlink price key levels also highlight the importance of technical indicators such as the MACD, which has recently signaled potential short-term strength. These Chainlink price key levels could be decisive factors in determining whether the asset experiences a steady rise or a potential downturn. BNB’s Bullish Trajectory: Riding the Wave of On-Chain Activity The recent BNB surge has drawn the attention of analysts monitoring its on-chain metrics and positive indicators. Data reveals that active addresses on the BNB Chain have reached record highs, indicating a growing level of engagement with the network. This BNB surge is further supported by the movement of tokens off exchanges by spot traders, a move often interpreted as a sign of long-term holding intentions. Market observers also note that a favorable long-to-short ratio suggests the possibility of continued gains, although the overall crypto market remains subject to volatility. The BNB surge could potentially target $793.86 if it maintains support above $605.90. Traders exercising caution point out that any shift in market sentiment could impact short-term prospects. In general, the BNB surge reflects a sense of optimism, tempered by the inherent unpredictability of the market. BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700: A 350% Bonus Bonanza BlockDAG’s presale has generated significant interest, having raised over $196 million and distributed more than 18.5 billion BDAG coins. The current price of $0.0248 represents a remarkable 2,380% increase for early participants, a return that rivals some of the most successful projects in recent memory. The FINALCALL700 bonus, offering a 350% multiplier, is viewed by many as an exceptional opportunity for those seeking substantial holdings before BDAG’s official launch. Large-volume purchases by whales indicate growing confidence in BlockDAG, as these buyers accumulate BDAG in anticipation of gains once the coin is listed on major exchanges. Analysts suggest that exceeding $200 million in presale funding is a near-term possibility, with projections of $600 million or more if current levels of interest persist. BlockDAG’s potential as a leading cryptocurrency is being discussed, with many pointing out that the highest returns often originate from presale stages. BDAG appears to fit this description for many who missed out on previous market opportunities. Those eager to avoid another missed chance are capitalizing on the 350% bonus, recognizing that such a substantial multiplier might not be available again. The combination of whale accumulation, robust presale participation, and expectations of a significant price increase upon launch has created considerable excitement around BDAG, fueling speculation that this opportunity could provide substantial returns in a short time! Market Overview The cryptocurrency market is exhibiting activity across various assets. Chainlink price key levels are holding near the $18 support, with traders assessing whether LINK can advance towards the $22-$25 range or if a drop to $14 is possible. The BNB surge continues, supported by record-high network activity and strong long-term holding. If support above $605.90 remains, BNB could see further growth. Within the realm of crypto presales, BlockDAG has garnered considerable attention, offering a 350% bonus that has the potential to deliver significant returns. With over $196 million raised and 18.5 billion coins sold, BDAG is rapidly becoming a cryptocurrency of interest for traders seeking high returns. Chainlink price key levels, BNB’s surge, and BlockDAG’s presale success all point to a market filled with opportunities and potential, but also one that requires careful observation and analysis.

However, recent technical and on-chain metrics are raising red flags, prompting savvy investors to explore more promising opportunities, such as an emerging AI-powered altcoin currently in its final presale stages . Dogecoin Price: The Bullish Market Sentiment and Looming Risks Currently trading at around $0.26, Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced a modest decline of 2% in the past 24 hours, with trading volume dropping by 45%. However, despite this short-term dip, the cryptocurrency has shown remarkable resilience, boasting a year-to-date gain of over 213%. The Dogecoin price has been buoyed by strong bullish sentiment, with 76% of top traders on Binance holding long positions and a long-to-short ratio of 3.15. This optimism is further supported by significant exchange outflows, with $18 million worth of DOGE leaving exchange wallets in the past 24 hours, signaling potential accumulation by long-term holders. From a technical perspective, Dogecoin is trading within the golden Fibonacci zone, between the 50% and 61.8% retracement levels, often considered an optimal entry point for bullish traders. The cryptocurrency also remains above the 200 Exponential Moving Average on both daily and weekly charts, reinforcing the uptrend. However, not all indicators are positive. Dogecoin’s MVRV ratio recently crossed below its 200-day moving average, forming a “Death Cross” that has historically preceded significant price declines. In late 2023, a similar event led to a 26% drop, while mid-2024 saw an even steeper 44% crash. Adding to the concerns, whale activity on the Dogecoin network has plummeted by nearly 88% since mid-November, suggesting that major investors may be losing confidence in its short-term prospects. The Dogecoin price is testing critical resistance at $0.28. Failure to break through could lead to a test of lower support levels at $0.25 or even $0.22, highlighting the inherent risks in this volatile market. This Emerging Altcoin is Attracting Smart Money Amid the uncertainty surrounding the Dogecoin price, smart money is increasingly flowing into RCO Finance (RCOF) , an emerging altcoin currently in its presale phase. RCO Finance is positioning itself as a game-changer in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, offering innovative features that promise substantial returns for early investors. Its presale, now in its fifth stage, has already seen the RCOF token price surge by 684% from its initial price of $0.01275 to its current price of $0.10. The next presale stage will see the price rise to $0.13, with further increases expected as it approaches the final presale stage at $0.2142. Upon listing on crypto exchanges, the token is projected to debut at a price range of $0.4 to $0.6, with analysts forecasting an explosive rally above $1 post-listing, driven by the platform’s unique value proposition and growing community support. The allure of RCO Finance lies in its potential for massive gains, with early investors from stage one poised to achieve returns of up to 3,000% by the time the token reaches its expected listing price. This remarkable growth trajectory, combined with the project’s deflationary tokenomics — where unsold tokens are burned to enhance scarcity — makes RCOF an attractive option for investors seeking to diversify away from the volatility of the Dogecoin price. Why RCO Finance Is the Smart Choice Besides the value proposition, smart money is flowing into RCO Finance due to its cutting-edge features and robust ecosystem, which set it apart from traditional and decentralized financial platforms. At the heart of the platform is an AI-powered Robo Advisor, a machine learning-driven tool that provides personalized investment strategies tailored to users’ financial goals, risk tolerance, and market preferences. This no-code solution democratizes access to sophisticated trading strategies, enabling both novice and seasoned investors to optimize their portfolios without intermediaries, all at a low subscription cost. Users can catch early alerts 24/7, all year, on tokens with 100x potential, like the currently trending ‘ Polkadex (PDEX) ’ coin that has taken the crypto space by storm with a 132% weekly surge. Another standout feature is RCO Finance’s KYC-free ecosystem, which prioritizes user privacy and anonymity, making it particularly appealing to privacy-conscious investors. The platform also offers access to an expansive range of over 120,000 tradable assets across 12,500 asset classes, including stocks, bonds, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate and commodities. This diversity allows users to build well-balanced portfolios that mitigate risk while maximizing returns. Adding to investor confidence, RCO Finance’s smart contract has already been audited by SolidProof , ensuring security and transparency. As the team work on finalizing the platform’s development, the recently launched beta platform has attracted over 10,000 users, providing a glimpse into its seamless automation and user-friendly interface. Currently in internal testing, the highly anticipated alpha platform launch will introduce advanced monitoring facilities, further enhancing the Robo Advisor’s capabilities. Analysts predict that post-alpha launch, the price of RCOF could explode by more than 10,000%, making it a prime target for smart money seeking exponential gains as the Dogecoin price navigates through the volatile phase.

BTC remains up ~1% year to date, but is now ~10% below its record high. Ether's closing price ticked higher this week, but ETH remains down ~20% year to date and ~45% below its all-time high. XRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and the during the first month of 2025. However, it pulled back in February and is now up only ~10% year to date. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know. We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient . Bitcoin's closing price edged lower, settling just above $95,500 - its lowest level in over five weeks. BTC remains up ~1% year to date, but is now ~10% below its record high. Ether Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second-largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article. Ether's closing price ticked higher this week, but ETH remains down ~20% year to date and ~45% below its all-time high. XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. XRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and the during the first month of 2025. However, it pulled back in February and is now up only ~10% year to date. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead. On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

An announcement will come as soon as 2nd April. The president’s recent comments at his Mar-a-Lago club specified various sectors for possible tariffs, including chips, pharma, and automotive. When reporters asked him about upcoming levies on semiconductor chips, Trump said, “It’ll be 25% and higher, and it’ll go very substantially higher over a course of a year.” However, before announcing these new tariffs, he wants companies to have ample “time to come in.” He said, “When they come into the United States and they have their plant or factory here there is no tariff, so we want to give them a little bit of a chance.” Due to increasing concerns of investors, stocks in NY declined when markets opened on Wednesday, with General Motors Co. sliding 1%. As of yet, Trump did not mention whether these tariffs will be applied to specific countries. Malaysia and Singapore are highly exposed to tariffs on chips In the case of semiconductor chips, Malaysia and Singapore are probably the most exposed right now. In 2024, Malaysia exported $136 billion worth of semiconductors, becoming the sixth largest exporter. Recently, Lawrence Wong, Singapore’s Prime Minister announced that the nation will invest $744.8 million for a new semiconductor Research and Development facility. Trump hinted at the levies on semiconductor chips just a few hours after this announcement. Executives, lobby groups, and industry experts have warned that such tariffs can cause broad ripple effects in the industry, resulting in new costs and higher consumer prices. Some countries have also promised to retaliate after the tariffs take effect. How will these tariffs impact the AI industry? After taking office, Republican lawmakers suggested ending the CHIPS and Science Act. Now, we’re looking at 25% tariffs or higher, on semiconductor chip imports. Economists warn that such dual-pronged approach would potentially harm and slow down AI research in the US, and take away the nation’s competitive edge. This is because chip production and shortage of semiconductors is the biggest bottleneck for AI’s advancement. The administration promised to support the construction of US chip foundries to reduce reliance on Asia. Washington considers it a security weakness. The Commerce Department pledged to give up to $6.6 billion to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to expand its facilities in Arizona. However, Trump says that TSMC does not need money to prioritize chip production in the United States. He said, “They needed an incentive. And the incentive is going to be they’re not going to want to pay at 25, 50 or even 100% tax.” These tariffs could prove to be painful for both the consumers and manufacturers. Even giants like Nvidia could face higher costs despite having margins to absorb them for the time being.

The company says BBRL will help people and businesses make transactions more easily and safely. The Braza Group Plans for BBRL Stablecoin It is worth mentioning that Braza Group has been in the banking sector for over 15 years. Now, with the launch of BBRL, the company is moving into digital finance. According to the announcement , Braza Group said this stablecoin will give Brazilians and businesses a secure and stable way to trade and invest without the risk of sudden price changes. Similarly, Marcelo Sacomori, chief executive officer of Braza Group, said the project will help businesses manage money more efficiently and create more business opportunities. “With BBRL, we are giving people and companies a safer way to handle digital transactions. This is about more than just a new currency—it’s about shaping the future of finance in Brazil,” he explained. In addition, the firm’s CEO confirmed that BBRL will first be available to institutional clients in early 2025. After that, individuals can access it through the Braza On app. Reasons Behind Choosing the XRP Ledger Meanwhile, the statement published by Ripple Labs’ disclosed that Braza Group chose XRPL for BBRL because it is fast, secure, and can handle large transactions. Similarly, many digital asset investors have praised XRPL for making transfers quick and affordable. To complement this, Markus Infanger, Senior Vice President of RippleX, added that the XRP Ledger is a great fit for stablecoins like BBRL. Furthermore, the firm is partnering with the Brazilian Central Bank on the DREX project. The goal is to link traditional banks with blockchain technology, allowing the Central Bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) to interact more easily through a secure system. But for now, the entity is testing different ways to use blockchain technology, including digital asset management and secure bank transactions. The XRP Ledger is known to welcome amendments regularly, so it believes the chain is the best fit. A recent XRPL amendment is the NFTokenMintOffer , which went live on the mainnet last Sunday. The XRP Ledger Innovations: RLUSD Spotlight It is worth mentioning that BBRL is not the first stablecoin on XRPL. Several other digital currencies, such as Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin, have already been released on the network. This token is gaining traction and it hit a new supply milestone earlier this week. Regarding the future growth of BBRL stablecoin on the XRPL ledger, Sacomori Estimated that by 2025, Brazil will implement more regulations to support digital assets. This would eventually make the market safer to trade, ushered in by more development. He also shared that stablecoins will soon play a pertinent role in global finance. “We expect BBRL to capture about 30% of the market by the end of next year. Stablecoins are the future of digital transactions,” he said.

A crypto analyst who identified this bearish trend in the Solana price action has projected a drastic crash to new lows at $22. Solana Price Action Mirrors LUNA’s Catastrophic Collapse A pseudonymous crypto analyst on TradingView named PizzaDriver has released a recent technical analysis of the Solana price action. The market expert predicts that Solana, the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, could soon decline to drastic lows. Related Reading: Solana Price Will Complete 1,800% Surge To $4,000 With This Formation: Analyst The analyst drew parallels between Solana’s current chart structure and the LUNA meltdown of 2022. The weekly chart highlights that Solana has formed a Double Top pattern, a classic bearish reversal signal from an uptrend to a downtrend. This pattern appears like the letter “M”, creating two peaks and a dip in between. This pattern also signifies deteriorating momentum in the Solana price, as the cryptocurrency has been facing severe volatility. In addition to the Double Top pattern, Solana’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has exhibited a bearish divergence. This means that while its price attempted to reach new highs, it was unable to due to underlying weakness. This same RSI bearish divergence was observed in LUNA before its infamous market crash, which triggered a decline to a zero level. According to the TradingView analyst, if Solana fails to hold key support levels and breaks below them, it could trigger a widespread liquidity crisis that would send its price plummeting to $22, a significant historical support level last seen in 2022. Adding to the already concerning price outlook, major institutional investors appear to have already sold their holdings and taken profits at price highs. Ahead of the bull run, these investors have reportedly reallocated funds into other somewhat safer coins like Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB), which have been seeing steady growth in on-chain activities and have risen in value over the week. This redistribution increases the risk of a rapid sell-off, further weakening Solana’s fundamentals. Rug Pulls And High Fees Weigh On Solana Beyond bearish technical indicators and price forecasts, the Solana ecosystem is currently experiencing a rise in investor dissatisfaction. PizzaDriver revealed that the Solana blockchain has become a primary space for meme coins and speculative trading. Additionally, there are allegations of rug pulls and project abandonment in the ecosystem, leaving investors with a sour experience. Related Reading: Solana Forms Ascending Triangle For Possible Breakout, Analyst Sets $565 Target Many developers have allegedly created and launched projects, stolen investors’ funds, and disappeared, thus eroding trust in the network. Moreover, Solana’s transaction fees have skyrocketed, hitting record highs and contradicting its original appeal as a low-cost transaction alternative to Ethereum. As a result, investors have begun shifting focus to long-term projects with transparent roadmaps, security audits, and strong partnerships. Due to its numerous ecosystem dilemmas, the TradingView analyst disclosed that Solana risks losing its dominant position unless it addresses these fundamental challenges.

This significant event has captured the attention of the crypto community, especially with major exchanges revealing plans to list Pi Coin. The launch will mark Pi’s transition from a closed ecosystem to a fully decentralized network. The achievement of external wallet transfers together with exchange listings and decentralized applications (dApps) develops intense interest around Pi Coin price expectations. However, there are critical risks that could impact its price post-launch. 3 Major Risks That Could Tank Pi Network’s Price After Mainnet Launch The cryptocurrency world talks intensely about Pi Network as speculations rise about its upcoming mainnet launch date. The approaching launch on February 20th has triggered rising investor and expert apprehension regarding the future path of Pi Network along with its default token, Pi. From technical issues to the potential for mass selling, there are key risks that investors should be aware of. Here, we highlight three major factors that could affect Pi’s price after its mainnet launch. Binance, the largest exchange in the world, which recently launched a vote for $Pi listing, will definitely list it. The vote was just a pretext to create a lot of hype and for the OG #crypto whales to take notice and have time to prepare. Agree? #PiNetwork #Binance #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/B4k2V9zZhO — Pi Network News Global 𝛑 (@PiNewsGlobal) February 19, 2025 Technical Indicators Show Weakness Pi price charts are currently showing signs of vulnerability, with the token slipping below key support levels. In the past 24 hours, Pi Network’s IOU token has already seen a sharp 40% decline, prompting questions about its future price movement. The price has recently fallen below the $50 support level, which was previously considered a solid support level. This technical weakness could signal a further downturn in Pi’s price, especially if the trend continues after the mainnet launch. Early Miners Could Flood the Market Pi Network has a large base of early miners who have been accumulating tokens for years. The active miners operating on mainnet will probably cash out their holdings when the mainnet launches. A substantial market downturn would likely happen if the increased supply exceeds market demand during this period. The market entry of numerous coins would intensify the existing price reduction thus deepening the downward trend. Airdrop-Based Tokens Often Drop After Launch A substantial decline in value typically happens to cryptocurrencies that make their initial releases via airdrops or similar distribution methods. When Pi Network starts trading while widening its user base it may result in market flooding through airdropped tokens that trigger immediate token dumping. The history of airdrop projects shows this pattern has become standard so Pi Network may encounter the same outcome when supply exceeds market demand. The mainnet launch of Pi Network requires investors to analyze these significant risks. Investors need to approach the market with caution while tracking Pi Network project developments along with market information.

SecondSwap uses a liquidity routing algorithm that optimizes trade execution and minimizes price slippage to ensure secure and scalable trading experiences for buyers and sellers. “By introducing a decentralized order book-style exchange, we are bringing transparency to token secondary markets,” said Kanny Lee, founder of SecondSwap, in an email to CoinDesk. “Our platform provides visibility into buy and sell orders, leveraging price discovery mechanisms such as market depth and liquidity profiling. Through seamless wallet integration, we ensure proof of control for sellers and proof of funds for buyers, enhancing security and trust.” Secondary markets for locked tokens refer to platforms or mechanisms where tokens that are under some form of lock-up or vesting schedule can be traded before they are fully released or unlocked. These markets provide a way for holders of locked tokens to gain liquidity, meaning they can convert their holdings into cash or other assets before the tokens are fully unlocked — giving early liquidity to sellers and the chance of gaining assets at a discount for buyers. SecondSwap has introduced a bid campaign to facilitate price discovery and enhance liquidity in early weeks, allowing traders to set their own prices and support matching between buyers and sellers once the buy/sell flow feature is enabled. Traders link their wallets, accessing a list of locked tokens that they can express an interest in buying by setting their preferred price target. Participants will be notified when inventory is available at prevailing prices, ensuring early adopters can engage with new opportunities as they emerge. The platform plans to expand to the Solana network in the coming months, a feat Lee says could unlock over $500 million in volume. “Locked token liquidity represents billions of dollars of untapped value. The impact of unlocking this liquidity cannot be understated. On Solana alone, even activating just 10% of dormant liquidity, could inject over $500 million in actionable volume,” Lee said. “It’s definitely one of the drivers for partnering with Solana at the outset. When coupled with the impact that SecondSwap’s vesting mechanism can offer memecoins - to reduce circulating supply - the Solana partnership will continue to flourish and benefit the wider market.”",Markets|Ethereum,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|ETH|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-20 01:00:00

The CoinDesk Memecoin Index will track the largest fifty memecoins by market capitalization — a list that includes dogecoin (DOGE), shiba inu (SHIB), floki (FLOKI), among others — while the CoinDesk 100 serves as a single benchmark for the top hundred tokens by market cap. “CoinDesk Memecoin Index responds to traders' need for liquidity and volatility while the CoinDesk 100 provides one-stop access to the most liquid tokens,” said Chris Tyrer, VP, head of institutional at Bullish. “We are thrilled to continue providing our clients access to the broader digital asset landscape, complementing these indices with our robust regulatory framework,"" he added.

The pseudonymous analyst known as Altcoin Sherpa tells his 242,900 followers on the social media platform X that he is leaning bullish on the utility token of the decentralized open financial system Hyperliquid ( HYPE ). “Best positions right now in order of best to worst: Cash. Majors. HYPE. Utility or older coins like AAVE, LINK, XRP, OM. Everything else is pretty mehhh.” HYPE is trading for $23.27, at time of writing, down 8.8% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the trader suggests that Ethereum ( ETH ) may have an explosive move this cycle, but is uncertain when. “Everyone talking about ETH and it makes a lot of sense: Top Trump projects are on ETH ( LINK, AAVE, others). SOL is pretty screwed from a mindshare perspective (rugs/etc.). No real ETH pump (yet). ETH/BTC has been f**ed. I do believe it’ll happen, just don’t know when/how.” However, he warns that in the near term, ETH may be forming a bull trap. “ETH: I’m not going to get trapped on this one.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X ETH is trading for $2,662 at time of writing, down 2.9% in the last 24 hours. Lastly, the analyst suggests that artificial intelligence (AI)-focused altcoin Artificial Superintelligence Alliance ( FET ) and AI-related memecoin Act I: The AI Prophecy ( ACT ) may have reached their market bottoms and may be poised for breakouts “I think we’re anywhere from one month to two weeks into the consolidation period for most of these shitcoins. This is the chop period where nothing much really happens, but I still feel that most of the good ones are fairly bottomed at this point. FET, ACT are two examples.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X FET is trading for $0.72 at time of writing, down 4% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, ACT is trading for $0.18 at time of writing, up 1.3% on the day.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) is riding strong technical momentum, up 22% this month, fueled by a Golden Cross pattern and growing institutional interest. Polkadot (DOT) is holding firm above $4.8, signaling resilience in a volatile market. But while these established tokens are drawing attention, Web3Bay (3BAY) is quietly emerging as the best opportunity in 2025. Its presale has already raised $1.50 million, selling 360 million tokens in record time. Unlike speculative pumps, Web3Bay is backed by real-world utility, offering a decentralized marketplace with peer-to-peer transactions, staking rewards, and DAO governance. With early investors securing tokens at $0.00456 and an expected launch price of $0.1959, Web3Bay’s upside potential is unmatched. The race to get in early is on. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Surges 22%—Can It Break Past $30? Hyperliquid (HYPE) has gained 22% this month, positioning itself as one of the best-performing altcoins. The token saw a 7.12% jump in the past 24 hours, bringing its price closer to the $30 resistance level. With a market cap of $9.08 billion and $157.7 million in daily trading volume, investor interest is rising. Technical indicators suggest further upside. The Golden Cross formation between the 50-day and 200-day EMAs signals strong buying pressure, while the MACD remains bullish, indicating sustained momentum. If HYPE breaks above $29.90, it could rally toward $35.50. However, failure to hold current levels may lead to a pullback to $24.30 or lower support at $18.25. Polkadot (DOT) Holds Firm at $4.8—Is a Breakout to $6.2 Next? Polkadot (DOT) is showing resilience amid market volatility, holding steady above the $4.8 support level. While other altcoins struggle with uncertainty, DOT’s stability suggests strong buying interest, preventing a deeper price drop. Despite trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), DOT is attempting to push toward $6.2 resistance. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering near the 50% mark, indicating a potential shift in momentum. If RSI moves above this level, buying pressure could increase, leading to further gains. If DOT breaks $6.2, it could target $7.7 and $9.8, with a potential move toward $11.9 if bullish momentum strengthens. However, losing $4.8 support could see DOT retreat to $3.5 or even $1.9. Web3Bay: The Hottest Crypto Presale of February—Don’t Miss Out! Web3Bay is taking the crypto market by storm, rapidly advancing through its presale batches as demand surges. In just a few weeks, the project has raised over $1.50 million, with more than 360 million tokens sold. This lightning-fast progression signals strong investor confidence, and with each new batch, prices continue to rise—meaning early adopters are already locking in massive gains before the token even hits exchanges. What makes Web3Bay stand out? Unlike speculative tokens, Web3Bay is built for real-world utility, revolutionizing e-commerce with a decentralized marketplace that cuts out middlemen, lowers fees, and allows for direct peer-to-peer transactions. The project supports crypto and fiat payments, including PayPal, ensuring broad accessibility. Plus, staking rewards and DAO governance give holders long-term incentives beyond just trading. With batch prices increasing steadily, Web3Bay is shaping up to be one of the most lucrative presales of 2025. Early investors buying at $0.00456 per token are eyeing an expected launch price of $0.1959, positioning them for over 4,000% gains. The window to get in early is closing fast, and once Web3Bay hits the market, demand is expected to skyrocket. Next 100x Crypto Opportunities While Hyperliquid (HYPE) and Polkadot (DOT) offer traders potential gains, their paths remain tied to market fluctuations and resistance levels. HYPE needs to clear $30, and DOT must reclaim $6.2 for continued upside. Meanwhile, Web3Bay’s momentum isn’t tied to speculation—it’s being driven by real adoption and demand. As it disrupts the $5.7 trillion e-commerce market, Web3Bay is set to become more than just a token—it’s an entire ecosystem. With its rapidly increasing presale prices and limited token supply, early adopters have a once-in-a-cycle opportunity for 4,000%+ returns. The clock is ticking, and when Web3Bay hits exchanges, the opportunity to buy at these prices will be gone. HYPE and DOT might rise, but 3BAY is leading the next wave of crypto adoption—don’t miss it.

40564351,https://timestabloid.com/?p=57871,1740013238,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"PropiChain is the Best Altcoin to Buy Along with Dogecoin in 2025, Experts Claims",https://timestabloid.com/propichain-is-the-best-altcoin-to-buy-along-with-dogecoin-in-2025/,"In a shocking twist of events, PropiChain (PCHAIN) has topped the shortlist of the best altcoin to buy alongside Dogecoin (DOGE). This comes after most cryptos failed to meet their market predictions for Q1 2025, prompting investors to think more strategically. Thankfully, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to blaze ahead, boosting its perception as a serious investment rather than a speculative one. However, alongside Dogecoin, experts point to PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a new token they believe will rake in massive profits in 2025. Dogecoin: Why DOGE is Up and Finding The Next Best Altcoin to Buy Dogecoin (DOGE) has faced bearish trends in recent weeks but has climbed over 5.97% over the past week. Currently trading at $0.2727 , Dogecoin is at its highest mark since February 3, when the coin recovered from a drastic dip to $0.224. This spike followed the SEC’s announcement that it has received an application to create a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) from Greyscale, a leading crypto asset manager. Greyscale’s intention to create Dogecoin ETF isn’t new, but the SEC’s formal approval will get the ball rolling on the review process. Much like the Bitcoin ETF approval helped push the coin to new heights, analysts predict that the Dogecoin price will respond favorably if the SEC grants approval, even potentially making DOGE the best altcoin to buy in 2025. But even more interesting is PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a new altcoin that’s set to surge alongside Dogecoin, even mirroring the iconic 2021 DOGE rally. Aside from PropiChain’s near-identical growth pattern to Dogecoin, investors are calling PCHAIN the best altcoin to buy now due to transformative blockchain solutions for the $634 trillion real estate industry. Why PropiChain is the Best Altcoin to Buy in 2025? PropiChain (PCHAIN) is positioning itself as the next wave of innovation in a real estate market valued at roughly $634 trillion. Powered by its native PCHAIN AI altcoin, the platform merges artificial intelligence, RWA tokenization, metaverse integration, and smart contracts to streamline every aspect of property transactions. The surge in global AI investments has brought increased attention to PropiChain, which offers a suite of AI-driven features for PCHAIN holders . Personalized property searches, precise appraisals, advanced market analytics, automated trading, and round-the-clock virtual support are all part of its robust toolset. AI capabilities within the metaverse marketplace allow users to pinpoint promising properties quickly, aided by sophisticated filters that assess factors like investment potential, neighborhood trends, and historical performance. This level of detail provides an advantage in a competitive landscape, reinforced by Automated Valuation Models (AVMs) that deliver unbiased, data-backed assessments. By mapping future market fluctuations, these models help investors optimize decision-making without second-guessing. The platform’s automatic trading functionality further refines the investment experience by letting users set buy or sell targets in advance. Once those thresholds are met, trades execute instantly, capturing opportunities even when investors are away from their screens. Beyond AI, the broader PropiChain ecosystem opens the door to fractional ownership through tokenized real estate, making premium properties accessible to a wider audience. An immersive metaverse marketplace brings a global dimension to property transactions, while smart contracts simplify renting processes by automating leasing, rent collection, and renewals. This fusion of AI, tokenization, and smart contracts positions PropiChain at the leading edge of digital real estate. With projections that place PCHAIN’s growth on par with high-profile crypto rallies, analysts are notably bullish, calling PropiChain the best altcoin to buy now ahead of the coming bull run. PropiChain BlockAudit and Exchange Listings Security remains one of the top priorities in the cryptocurrency world, and PropiChain has made it clear that protecting users is a central goal. By securing a certified audit from BlockAudit (a trusted name in blockchain security), the project demonstrates a strong commitment to safeguarding its smart contracts against potential exploits or weaknesses. This verification boosts investor confidence, showing that PCHAIN’s infrastructure is robust and prepared for real-world use. Beyond its security achievements, PropiChain also benefits from being listed on CoinMarketCap . This inclusion places the project in front of a global audience of crypto enthusiasts and potential investors. Although PropiChain hasn’t yet reached major CEXs, industry observers believe such a listing could trigger a rapid and significant price increase, offering further incentive for those watching the project’s development. PCHAIN Presale Selling the Best Altcoin to Buy in 2025 for $0.011 PropiChain is currently in Stage 2 of the PCHAIN presale at just $0.011 per token, and the upcoming Stage 3 price of $0.023 suggests an easy doubling of value, even before the token appears on major exchanges. Yet the real excitement lies in a projected $3.56 target, implying a remarkable 32,400% climb from today’s price. The math is compelling: an initial $700 could grow to $226,800 if the token reaches $3.56, making PCHAIN potentially the best altcoin to buy in early 2025. Although Dogecoin (DOGE) still attracts attention and may advance toward the $1 mark, such a move would rely on a widespread crypto market rally. PropiChain (PCHAIN) , on the other hand, demonstrates tangible utility, AI-driven technology, and a clear advantage as an emerging project. Furthermore, PCHAIN operates in a massive real-estate sector, aiming to provide solutions with genuine value. Dogecoin remains well-known, but its growth prospects are constrained by limited innovation. Even if it does hit $1, the increase from its current levels would be around 400%, which is incomparable to PropiChain. With its Stage 2 presale pricing still at $0.011 and Stage 3 set to jump to $0.023, the 324x profit potential will be cut by more than half, making now the ideal time to acquire what could be the best altcoin to buy in 2025.

He said: Bitcoin set multiple all-time record highs because everyone knows that I’m committed to making America the crypto capital . President Donald Trump His comments came as Bitcoin traded just shy of $96,700 on Wednesday evening, having hit an all-time high of more than $108,000 earlier this year. Trump positions the US as a global crypto leader In his presidential campaign and since his election to office, Trump has portrayed himself as a pro-digital assets sort of guy. Before being elected last year, he vowed to make the US “the crypto capital of the planet.” Since his inauguration, he’s made strides to support the industry, like appointing former regulator Paul Atkins, whom the crypto industry celebrated as a crypto-friendly agency head, to lead the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Trump also touted Miami’s position in the cryptocurrency space, calling it the “center of the action” and hinting that it could stay the heartbeat of digital asset activity. Trump noted that his administration is committed to leading America at the forefront of everything, and one of those is crypto. Trump has signed executive orders while in office to encourage the development of digital assets. In January, he signed an order that he called “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology” that formed a working group to create a federal regulatory framework for crypto. The order also aimed to prohibit a central bank digital currency (CBDC), a move supported broadly by the crypto community. Trump has criticized the SEC’s regulatory stance under former Chair Gary Gensler. The agency, which took numerous enforcement actions against crypto firms during Gensler’s tenure, had long been viewed as an antagonist to the industry. Trump claimed Wednesday that he had “totally ended that war.” Trump noted that the regulatory watchdog was really hostile to Bitcoin and crypto up until the very end. However, he noted that just before the end, they suddenly realized there were so many people on Bitcoin and crypto that they started being very nice. Trump champions crypto boom as Washington gears up for pro-digital asset legislation Trump’s comments arrived at a moment when Washington is expected to welcome its most pro-crypto Congress yet. Key lawmakers, including Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott and House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill, are leading efforts to draft regulatory frameworks for the industry. Alongside policy-oriented moves, Trump has also taken personal ownership of the crypto movement. In fact, before he even took office, he launched the TRUMP meme coin, which ballooned to billions of dollars in market capitalization. His wife, Melania Trump, soon joined him with her own cryptocurrency venture. Trump’s leadership, in particular, could further strengthen the US’s position as a dominant player in the world’s crypto economy, especially with a growing political push for adopting digital assets and a favorable regulatory environment.

Take Binance Coin (BNB), for example. When it first launched in 2017, its initial price was just $0.10 per token. Fast forward to today, and BNB has surged to over $500, making early investors millions. Those who hesitated in Binance Coin’s early days now look back with regret.

Enter Arctic Pablo Coin, the top crypto coin that’s making waves in the market with an innovative presale model and a unique growth strategy.

While some skeptics doubted its potential, early adopters saw the vision behind Binance’s ecosystem. As the Binance exchange expanded, so did the utility of BNB, driving its price up. By 2021, Binance Coin reached an all-time high of $690. Imagine investing $1,000 in BNB’s ICO—you’d now have millions. Unfortunately, many missed this golden opportunity, dismissing it as just another token. The key takeaway? Spotting potential early and seizing the moment can be life-changing in the crypto space.

The Blockchain Association also pointed out in a letter to the leaders of both houses and parties that the IRS rule extends the definition of a “broker” to mean software through which users interact with DeFi protocols. The group also noted that the current change could put too much pressure on developers working on DeFi systems. That rule affects software companies that do not have possession of personal property by requiring them to gather and disclose personal identifying data and transaction details. The Blockchain Association explained that compliance would change the DeFi software dramatically and even necessitate some middlemen for reports. According to Kristin Smith, the CEO of the Blockchain Association, the group has already embarked on a legal battle regarding the rule. However, she said that getting Congress to repeal it would take a shorter time compared to any other course of action. Impact on U.S. DeFi innovation The Blockchain Association also argued that allowing the rule to proceed would be detrimental to the United States’ dominance in DeFi and financial technology. The letter clarified that the regulation solely targets domestic DeFi firms, while international companies providing the same services to U.S. consumers are not affected. The group explained that this imbalance may slow down domestic innovation, though it may push some projects offshore. “Second, the rule raises privacy and surveillance concerns. It requires DeFi industry participants to collect and store users’ personal identifying information, and to report transaction details to the IRS. This is a dramatic infringement that disincentivizes innovation.” The Blockchain Association Ron Hammond, the senior director of government relations of the association was optimistic that the rule would be repealed across the parties. He cited similar sentiments in 2021 when issues to do with regulation of decentralized finance, DeFi, held up the infrastructure bill. Hammond criticized what he described as overregulation by the Biden administration and asserted the industry is not in the phase of learning anymore. He underscored the need for policy and regulation that promote innovation but effectively shield consumers. He also noted that DeFi is gaining support from the finance and banking authorities, explaining that sentiments are changing as Trump has vowed to make America the leader in cryptocurrency. Other crypto organizations have also expressed a lot of concern about the IRS rule. The DeFi Education Fund hailed the growing trend as a response to what it termed as unworkable and unconstitutional regulation.

This marks a key step in the bloc’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation. However, the absence of Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, has raised concerns about regulatory priorities and the potential consequences for the digital asset market. Tether Misses Out as EU Grants MiCA Approval to 10 Stablecoin Providers The largest stablecoin issuer, Tether, was noticeably absent from the list of ten firms authorized under MiCA regulations to issue stablecoins in the EU. The approved entities include Banking Circle, Circle, Crypto.Com, Fiat Republic, Membrane Finance, Quantoz Payments, Schuman Financial, Societe Generale, StabIR, and Stable Mint. These firms have issued ten euro-pegged stablecoins and five US dollar-pegged stablecoins. Despite Tether’s $141 billion market capitalization, the company did not receive approval, which means crypto platforms have begun delisting USDT for EU-based users. Alongside stablecoin issuers, 11 MiCA-authorized Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) were approved across Germany, the Netherlands, and Malta. These providers offer services in trading, exchange, execution, custody, and transfers within the EU regulatory framework. Expanding Operations Beyond the EU With growing regulatory restrictions in the EU, Tether has continued to expand its operations in other regions. The stablecoin issuer recently proposed to acquire a 51% stake in a South African energy company, signaling a shift in focus toward investments outside of digital assets. Tether’s exclusion from MiCA-approved stablecoin issuers raises questions about the EU’s regulatory approach. The company expressed disappointment over the decision, stating that the delistings were “hasty and unwarranted.” However, MiCA’s rules require stablecoin issuers to meet specific compliance standards. Similarly, Tether has expanded into the sports industry, recently investing in Juventus to strengthen its presence in mainstream sectors. This move aligns with its broader strategy of integrating digital assets, AI, and biotech into traditional industries. MiCA Rules To Isolate the EU Crypto? Industry experts caution that the strict regulations under MiCA could isolate the EU’s digital asset market. Natalia Łątka, Director of Public Policy and Regulatory Affairs at Merkle Science, suggested that the EU’s regulatory stance may discourage foreign firms from operating in the region. She also noted that local crypto companies could consider relocating outside the EU to avoid restrictions associated with MiCA compliance. Additionally, some analysts argue that the EU’s regulatory focus on compliance over innovation could reduce market competitiveness. While MiCA aims to provide clarity and stability, critics believe it may lead to fewer options for European crypto users. This pushes firms toward jurisdictions with more flexible regulations.

Meet Mutuum Finance (MUTM),https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-this-cheap-altcoin-be-the-next-cardano-ada-meet-mutuum-finance-mutm/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently racing through the opening phase of its presale, raising over $774,320 and attracting 1,320 holders in a matter of days. With more than 70% of Phase 1 tokens already sold at $0.01 each, investors are scrambling to secure their stakes in a project analysts are calling a potential rival to Cardano (ADA). Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines decentralized lending solutions, an overcollateralized stablecoin, and a price-stabilizing buyback system, features positioning it for a 600% surge to $0.06 at launch. Experts further predict a staggering 100x climb to $1 in 2025, making this presale a rare chance to enter a high-growth DeFi ecosystem at ground level. Mutuum Finance Redefining Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another token; it’s a functional platform addressing real gaps in decentralized finance. The protocol enables users to lend or borrow digital assets through two models: peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P). Lenders deposit assets like USDT into liquidity pools, earning adjustable interest rates tied to borrowing demand. Borrowers, meanwhile, leverage crypto collateral to access liquidity while retaining ownership, a feature appealing to long-term investors avoiding forced asset sales. The P2C model relies on audited smart contracts for security, while P2P transactions let users negotiate terms directly. Both systems prioritize flexibility, transparency, and reduced risk, setting Mutuum Finance apart in a crowded market. By Phase 4, the platform plans a full launch, integrating an overcollateralized stablecoin backed by on-chain reserves. This addition will streamline borrowing processes and enhance price stability, further boosting MUTM’s utility-driven demand. Presale Momentum Builds Ahead of Beta Launch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capitalizing on its early momentum, with Phase 1 selling out rapidly and subsequent stages set to incrementally raise the token price to $0.06. Investors buying now could lock in a 6x return by launch day, a figure grounded in the project’s structured presale model, not speculative hype. The team has also announced a $100,000 giveaway for early participants, incentivizing community growth ahead of its exchange debut. Adding to the urgency, Mutuum Finance plans to release a beta version of its lending platform alongside the token launch. This operational product will immediately drive user adoption, transaction volume, and liquidity, critical factors for sustaining MUTM’s post-launch growth. Unlike projects reliant on vague roadmaps, Mutuum Finance delivers tangible utility from day one, a key reason analysts are bullish on its $1 target in 2025. Why MUTM Outshines Cardano (ADA) in Utility While Cardano (ADA) has cemented itself as a blockchain pioneer, its focus on scalability and smart contracts lacks the immediate financial incentives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers. MUTM’s lending protocols and stablecoin integration create direct revenue streams for users, blending passive income with capital appreciation. Additionally, the buy-and-distribute mechanism allocates a portion of platform fees to purchase MUTM from the market, redistributing tokens to stakers. This built-in demand driver ensures continuous buying pressure, a feature absent in most Layer 1 tokens like ADA. The presale’s tiered pricing structure further advantages early adopters. With Phase 1 nearly exhausted, entry prices will rise in subsequent stages, rewarding those who act swiftly. A $1,500 investment today could balloon to $10,500 at launch and potentially $150,000 if MUTM hits $1 in 2025, a trajectory supported by its deflationary tokenomics and expanding user base. As the crypto market develops, projects offering real-world utility and structured growth are dominating. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) checks every box: a low presale price, explosive short-term gains, and a long-term vision anchored in DeFi’s expanding role. With Phase 1 slots dwindling, the window for securing tokens at $0.01 is closing fast. The question isn’t whether Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could follow Cardano’s (ADA) success, it’s whether investors will recognize this opportunity before the presale concludes. Those who act now position themselves for a 600% return at launch and a potential 100x surge in 2025.

Earlier this year, ADA surged past $1.15, but by February, it tumbled to $0.68; a 40% drop. The recent 15% rebound has helped recover some losses, but technical indicators suggest that growth may be stalling. A closer look at Cardano price charts reveals a descending triangle formation, often signaling a potential breakdown rather than a bullish recovery. If Cardano price remains trapped under key resistance, it could dip back to $0.72, with further selling potentially pushing it to $0.66. However, if buying pressure strengthens, ADA could reclaim $0.90 and eventually challenge the $1 mark again. While ADA stabilizes, investors are looking elsewhere for high-growth opportunities, and one project catching attention is RCO Finance . Unlike ADA, which has already established itself and slowed down, RCOF is in its early stages; meaning its upside potential is massive. This AI Crypto Is Built for Smarter Investing and Bigger Profit Crypto investors are always on the lookout for ways to maximize profits, and RCO Finance delivers exactly that with its game-changing AI-powered Robo Advisor. Unlike traditional investments where you need to constantly analyze charts, follow news, and time your trades, RCOF does all the heavy lifting for you. The Robo Advisor scans the market in real time, gathering data from sources like Bloomberg and Reuters to pinpoint optimal entry and exit points. This means you no longer need to guess when to buy or sell. For example, the PEPE token surged over 10,000% just a few days after it launched but most people got in after that surge. The Robo Advisor would have identified patterns and alerted you to it before that surge. But it’s not just about spotting winners; it also detects downturns, helping you exit before prices crash. And the Robo Advisor continuously adapts to market trends and your personal investment style, optimizing your portfolio for better performance. Whether you’re a conservative investor looking for steady growth or an aggressive trader chasing big gains, the AI fixes strategies to fit your goals. Beyond AI, RCO Finance offers features that traditional crypto platforms simply don’t. Investors can diversify into over 120,000 assets, including bonds, ETFs, and tokenized real estate, all within a single ecosystem. Also, RCOF’s debit card lets you spend your crypto holdings seamlessly. And best of all, the platform is completely KYC-free, meaning you can trade, invest, and spend without invasive verification processes. Presale Gains and Future Growth Make RCOF the Top Bet for 2025 RCO Finance is already proving its value with a fully operational Beta Platform . Unlike most crypto projects that launch without a working product, RCOF has over 10,000 active users testing its features. The team is now refining its Alpha version, which will introduce even more powerful AI enhancements. The presale is currently in its 5th stage, with tokens selling at $0.10. But time is running out; once the next stage kicks in, the price jumps to $0.13, an instant 30% gain. With over $13 million raised so far, momentum is building fast, and early buyers are locking in their positions before RCOF gets listed on major exchanges. Let’s put this into perspective. A $1,000 investment at this stage grows to $1,300 when the next stage launches. But that’s just the beginning. Once RCOF hits major listings and demand skyrockets, we’re looking at potential 10,000x gains. That same $1,000 could turn into $100,000 if RCOF follows the trajectory of past crypto success stories. SolidProof, a top blockchain auditing firm, has verified that RCOF is fully secure with no vulnerabilities, so you can invest without worries. ADA’s Slow Growth vs. RCOF’s Rapid Momentum, Which One Wins? While ADA remains a solid choice for long-term holders, its growth has slowed dramatically. Even if the Cardano price reaches $1.50, that’s only a 2x return. Compare that to RCOF , a brand-new project with faster adoption, stronger real-world utility, and a rapidly expanding presale. Investors who got in early have already seen gains, and those who wait risk missing out. The next presale stage alone increases the price by 30%, and by the time it lists, early adopters could be sitting on life-changing returns. The window of opportunity is closing fast, and delaying just a few weeks could mean watching RCOF skyrocket from the sidelines instead of profiting from its rise. If Cardano price is moving at a slow pace, RCOF is speeding toward massive success; making now the best time to jump in.

Web3Bay is rewriting the rules of decentralized commerce, rapidly advancing through its presale while offering real utility and 6,000% return potential. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) is positioned for a breakout to $260, with bullish technical indicators pointing to a strong rally. Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, is at a crossroads, struggling to hold $2,500 as market sentiment wavers. ‘ For investors, this isn’t just another price cycle—it’s a chance to position early before the biggest gains materialize. Web3Bay’s record-breaking presale momentum proves that smart money is already moving. Will you act before the window closes, or will you be left watching from the sidelines? Solana (SOL) Gears Up for a Potential Surge to $260—Can It Hold Key Support? Solana (SOL) is showing signs of strength as it trades within a well-defined parallel channel. Analysts suggest a possible breakout, with price targets between $225 and $260, provided it maintains key support at $190. Technical indicators favor an upward move. The MACD has turned bullish, hinting at growing momentum, while Fibonacci retracement points to $225 as a critical pivot for further gains. If SOL stays above support, it could rally toward these targets. Market sentiment leans bullish, with long positions outweighing shorts and open interest rising, signaling investor confidence. A surge in futures activity suggests traders are positioning for a breakout. Ethereum (ETH) Teeters Near $2,500—Can It Avoid a Bigger Drop? Ethereum’s price has struggled to regain momentum after repeated rejections at $4,000 in December. Currently trading below the 200-day moving average at $3,000, ETH is testing resistance near $2,700. A successful breakout could signal a bullish reversal, but failure may push ETH toward $2,350 or even $2,000. On the 4-hour chart, Ethereum is consolidating, with RSI nearing 50%, hinting at weakening momentum. A drop below this threshold could trigger further selling pressure. Investors should watch $2,700 closely—a decisive move above it could change the trend, while rejection may lead to deeper losses. Can Ethereum hold firm, or is a bigger drop inevitable? Web3Bay: The Next Amazon of Crypto—A Rare 6,000% Opportunity Imagine investing in Amazon in its early days—before it became the e-commerce giant it is today. Those who saw its potential and got in early made life-changing returns. Web3Bay is following a similar trajectory, bringing decentralized commerce to the blockchain while eliminating high fees and middlemen. As a Web3-powered marketplace, it allows users to buy and sell goods seamlessly using crypto and fiat, including PayPal, making it one of the most practical and scalable blockchain projects today. The presale is moving at lightning speed—$1.50 million raised and 360 million tokens sold in just weeks. Each batch sells out fast, with prices increasing at every stage. Investors buying now at $0.00456 per token are looking at a projected launch price of $0.1959, meaning 6,000% potential gains post-listing. Opportunities like this don’t come often—early movers are locking in exponential profits before Web3Bay goes mainstream. Will you? One Clear Winner—The Time to Move Is Now While Solana’s bullish momentum and Ethereum’s uncertain future keep traders guessing, Web3Bay is delivering real, measurable success. Its presale has already raised $1.50 million, with 360 million tokens sold in weeks, and prices rising at every batch. Early investors at $0.00456 are securing 6,000% returns post-listing, a rare opportunity before the token hits major exchanges. Solana may reach $260, and Ethereum could recover, but Web3Bay isn’t just another speculative asset—it’s a true disruptor in blockchain commerce. The presale is selling out fast, and history shows that early movers in high-utility projects see the biggest returns. The choice is clear—position now or risk missing one of the biggest crypto investment opportunities of 2025. Will you seize it or sit back and watch?

40565132,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=699647,1740016858,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/40565132.jpeg,Bitcoin’s Make-or-Break Moment: What’s Holding Back the Next Big Rally?,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-make-or-break-moment-whats-holding-back-the-next-big-rally/,"Bitcoin’s price has gradually increased, climbing from $96,000 to nearly $97,000 as of today. Although still shy of the coveted $100,000 mark, the leading cryptocurrency shows signs of resilience. This recovery is unfolding against the backdrop of mixed market signals, prompting analysts to weigh the potential for continued bullish momentum versus the risk of a near-term pullback. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Persistent Resistance at $100K, Analyst Eyes Next Step Bitcoin’s Market Momentum at a Crossroads One recent analysis from Onchain Edge, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, highlights Bitcoin’s current “critical decision zone.” Using two key indicators—the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio and the MVRV Ratio—Onchain Edge’s findings suggest a market that is not yet overvalued, though caution flags remain. While the overall on-chain data leans more positive, the contrasting signals highlight the precarious position of Bitcoin’s current rally. From a bullish perspective, the MVRV Ratio—an indicator that compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value—stands at 2.21, well below the levels that typically signal market tops (3.5–4.0). This suggests that Bitcoin’s current valuation is not overstretched, leaving room for further upside. Moreover, other indicators such as the Puell Multiple reinforce the notion that Bitcoin has not yet reached overbought conditions. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, if these macro indicators hold steady and buyers return in force, Bitcoin could continue its upward trajectory, potentially reclaiming six-figure territory before any substantial correction sets in. Possible Bearish Signals on the Horizon Despite these promising signs, the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, which gauges market sentiment by comparing aggressive buy and sell orders, stands at 0.96—below the 0.98 threshold often associated with bullish strength. Onchain Edge reveals that historically, levels around this range have preceded market corrections, as was the case during peaks in March and November of 2021. Should Bitcoin fail to break above resistance, this ratio could hint at a short-term top. A sustained failure to climb past current levels may trigger a temporary pullback, providing a cooling-off period before any subsequent rally. As Bitcoin hovers near this pivotal price point, the market remains finely balanced between cautious optimism and potential downside risk. Onchain Edge concludes that maintaining a level above $95,000, combined with a resurgence in buying activity, could pave the way for a move to new highs.

While the bull cycle appears intact, the coming days may determine whether Bitcoin’s current rally has enough fuel to continue, or if a pause is on the horizon.

BTC is rising within a range and might revisit the $98,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin started a decent recovery wave above the $95,500 zone. The price is trading above $96,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $96,700 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $96,000 zone. Bitcoin Price Recover Losses Bitcoin price formed a base above the $93,500 level and started a recovery wave . BTC was able to surpass the $94,000 and $94,200 resistance levels. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $98,825 swing high to the $93,288 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $96,700 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair even surpassed the $96,500 level and now faces hurdles near the $96,800 zone. Bitcoin price is now trading above $96,200 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $96,800 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $98,825 swing high to the $93,288 low. The first key resistance is near the $97,200 level. The next key resistance could be $98,000. A close above the $98,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $98,800 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $99,500 level or even $100,000. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $97,000 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $96,100 level. The first major support is near the $96,000 level. The next support is now near the $95,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $94,200 support in the near term.

40567076,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131047,1740020466,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Unlock Wall Street Trust: Why Crypto IPOs Are the Future, According to BitGo CEO",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-ipos-wall-street-trust/,"In a bold statement at Consensus Hong Kong 2025, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe has ignited a crucial conversation within the cryptocurrency sphere: the necessity for crypto firms to pursue Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) to genuinely earn the trust of Wall Street. But is going public the golden ticket to mainstream acceptance? Let’s dive into the insights shared by Belshe and explore what this could mean for the future of crypto finance . Why Crypto IPOs Are Key to Wall Street Trust Belshe’s core argument revolves around a simple yet profound concept: transparency breeds trust . In the traditional financial world, going public is a rite of passage, a demonstration of maturity and accountability. For crypto companies, often perceived as opaque and risky by traditional investors, an IPO could be the bridge to credibility. Here’s a breakdown of why: Enhanced Investor Confidence: Public companies are subject to rigorous financial reporting and audits. This level of scrutiny provides a safety net for investors, assuring them that the company’s operations are legitimate and financially sound. For Wall Street, accustomed to these standards, this is non-negotiable. Demonstrated Commitment to Transparency: IPOs mandate a level of openness that private crypto firms often lack. From detailed financial disclosures to regular shareholder updates, going public forces companies to operate under a spotlight, fostering trust through visibility. Access to Broader Capital: Public markets unlock access to significantly larger pools of capital compared to private funding rounds. This influx of investment can fuel growth, innovation, and expansion for crypto firms, propelling the entire industry forward. Navigating the Complex Landscape of SEC Crypto Policy The regulatory environment, particularly the stance of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , is a critical factor in the future of crypto finance . Belshe’s optimistic outlook is partly fueled by pro-crypto appointments within both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). But what does this mean in practice? While policy shifts are notoriously slow, these appointments signal a potential shift in regulatory sentiment. It suggests a move towards a more informed and perhaps more accommodating approach to cryptocurrency regulation. However, challenges remain: Challenge Potential Impact on Crypto IPOs Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear and consistent regulations across jurisdictions remains a significant hurdle. May deter some crypto firms from pursuing IPOs due to compliance complexities and potential legal risks. SEC Scrutiny: Even with pro-crypto appointments, the SEC’s primary mandate is investor protection. Crypto firms will face intense scrutiny during the IPO process. Demands rigorous preparation and adherence to stringent disclosure requirements for crypto companies aiming to go public. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of the crypto market can make it challenging for newly public crypto firms to maintain investor confidence and stock price stability. Requires robust risk management strategies and clear communication of long-term vision to investors. The Republican Influence and Potential Policy Overhaul Belshe highlighted the Republican control of both the U.S. House and Senate as a factor that could accelerate regulatory reforms. This political landscape presents a unique opportunity for the crypto industry. But how significant is this influence on SEC crypto policy ? With Republicans often advocating for less regulation and greater economic freedom, there’s a perceived alignment with the crypto industry’s desire for clearer and more favorable regulatory frameworks. This could translate into: Faster Legislative Action: Republican control might streamline the legislative process for crypto-related bills, potentially leading to quicker implementation of new policies. Pro-Business Regulatory Environment: A Republican-led Congress could favor regulations that foster innovation and growth within the crypto sector, potentially easing the path for crypto IPOs . Increased Dialogue and Collaboration: The political climate might encourage more open dialogue between regulators and the crypto industry, leading to more balanced and effective policies. Institutional Crypto Investment: The Next Frontier The push for crypto IPOs is intrinsically linked to the broader trend of institutional crypto investment . Wall Street’s trust isn’t just about individual investors; it’s about attracting the big players – institutional investors like pension funds, hedge funds, and asset managers. Why is their involvement so crucial? Massive Capital Inflow: Institutional investors manage trillions of dollars. Even a small allocation to crypto assets from these institutions would represent a monumental influx of capital into the market. Increased Market Stability: Institutional investment tends to be longer-term and more strategic, which can help to reduce market volatility and create a more stable foundation for growth. Mainstream Legitimacy: When established financial institutions invest in crypto, it sends a powerful signal of legitimacy to the broader public, accelerating mainstream adoption. Looking Ahead: The Transformative Future of Crypto Finance Mike Belshe’s perspective underscores a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. The journey towards widespread Wall Street crypto adoption may well hinge on the willingness of crypto firms to embrace the rigor and transparency of public markets through crypto IPOs . This isn’t just about raising capital; it’s about building trust, fostering legitimacy, and paving the way for the future of crypto finance . While regulatory hurdles and market volatility remain, the potential rewards are immense. As the political and regulatory landscape evolves, and as institutional interest in crypto continues to grow, the path to going public may become increasingly attractive – and perhaps even essential – for crypto firms seeking to solidify their place in the global financial ecosystem.

40567106,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131048,1740020610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Exclusive Reveal: WLFI Co-founder Unveils Bold DeFi Strategy, Shunning Venture Capital",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/wlfi-defi-venture-capital-strategy/,"In a fascinating turn of events at Consensus Hong Kong 2025, Zak Folkman, the co-founder of the buzzworthy DeFi project World Liberty Financial (WLFI), dropped a bombshell. Forget the usual route of chasing big bucks from venture capital firms. WLFI, it seems, charted a different course entirely. Folkman openly stated that WLFI’s token sale was deliberately designed as a powerful marketing engine, aimed squarely at building rock-solid crypto community ties. Intriguing, right? Let’s dive into what this means for WLFI and the wider world of decentralized finance. Why No Venture Capital for This DeFi Project? So, why did WLFI, a promising DeFi project , decide to sidestep the traditional venture capital funding route? According to Odaily’s report from Consensus Hong Kong, Folkman clarified that securing VC backing wasn’t on their agenda. Instead, the focus was laser-sharp on community engagement right from the get-go. This is a rather unconventional approach in the crypto space, where many projects heavily rely on venture capital injections to kickstart development and marketing efforts. Think about it. Venture capital firms often bring not just funds but also networks, expertise, and a certain level of prestige. However, they also come with expectations – and often, a significant stake in the project’s governance and future profits. WLFI’s decision suggests a desire for greater autonomy and a stronger emphasis on decentralized governance driven by its crypto community . The Token Sale: A Marketing Masterstroke? Folkman described the token sale not just as a fundraising event, but as a strategic marketing maneuver. This is a crucial distinction. Instead of solely aiming to amass capital, WLFI used the token sale to: Generate Buzz: A well-executed token sale naturally creates excitement and media attention around a project. Build a Community: By directly involving early adopters in the project’s financial ecosystem, WLFI fostered a sense of ownership and shared purpose. Decentralize Token Distribution: A public token sale, in theory, leads to a more distributed token ownership compared to private VC rounds, aligning with the ethos of decentralization. This approach could be seen as a clever move to bootstrap a crypto community organically, rather than relying on top-down influence from venture capitalists. It’s a bet on the power of grassroots support and decentralized participation. Addressing Investor Concerns and Celebrating Milestones Folkman acknowledged that the initial phases weren’t without their hurdles. Retail investors, known for their sharp eyes and even sharper questions, raised concerns about WLFI’s valuation and ambitious fundraising goals. Selling roughly 24 billion WLFI token s at $0.05 each, raking in a cool $1.2 billion, is no small feat and naturally invited scrutiny. However, Folkman highlighted a significant positive – WLFI achieved its milestones ahead of schedule. This suggests that despite the unconventional funding route and initial skepticism, the project is delivering on its promises and building momentum. Hitting milestones early is a powerful signal to the crypto community and can significantly boost confidence and long-term prospects. WLFI Token: Utility and Governance So, what exactly is the WLFI token and what does it do? Folkman clarified that it serves a dual purpose: Governance: Holding WLFI tokens likely grants users voting rights within the WLFI ecosystem, allowing the crypto community to participate in key decisions about the project’s future. Utility: Beyond governance, the WLFI token has practical applications within the WLFI platform. While specific utilities weren’t detailed in this report, utility could encompass access to premium features, reduced transaction fees, staking rewards, or participation in specific DeFi mechanisms within the WLFI ecosystem. The combination of governance and utility is crucial for the long-term health and value accrual of any crypto token. It ensures that token holders are not just passive investors but active participants in the project’s growth and direction. Navigating Unofficial Information and Future Trading With trading options, including swaps, not yet live for the WLFI token , Folkman issued a clear warning: steer clear of unofficial sources. In the often-wild west of crypto, misinformation and scams are rampant. Relying on verified channels for updates and information is paramount, especially during the early stages of a project. The absence of current trading options also implies that the WLFI token is still in its early distribution phase. The eventual launch of trading and swap functionalities will be a significant event, likely to influence price discovery and broader market participation. Is Shunning Venture Capital a New Trend in DeFi? WLFI’s approach begs the question: are we seeing a shift away from traditional venture capital reliance in the DeFi space? While VC funding remains a dominant force, projects like WLFI signal a potential trend towards community-centric models. Here’s a breakdown of the potential benefits and challenges of this approach: Benefits of Community-First, No Venture Capital Approach Challenges of Community-First, No Venture Capital Approach Greater autonomy and control for the project team. Stronger alignment with decentralized ethos. Potentially more loyal and engaged community. Reduced pressure for rapid, VC-driven growth at all costs. May lack the network and expertise VC firms provide. Potentially slower initial growth due to limited resources. Increased reliance on community marketing and organic growth. Higher risk if the token sale fails to generate sufficient capital or community interest. Ultimately, the success of WLFI’s strategy will be judged by its long-term performance and the vibrancy of its crypto community . However, their bold move to prioritize community over venture capital offers a fascinating case study in alternative funding models for DeFi project s. Conclusion: A Glimpse into DeFi’s Decentralized Future? WLFI’s story is more than just news; it’s a glimpse into the evolving landscape of DeFi and crypto funding. By consciously choosing to forgo venture capital and focus on community building through a strategic token sale , WLFI is challenging conventional wisdom and perhaps paving the way for a more decentralized and community-driven future in the crypto space. Their journey is one to watch closely, as it could redefine how DeFi project s are launched and sustained in the years to come. The crypto community is certainly taking note.

On Feb. 20, the SEC published a statement acknowledging receipt of the 21Shares’ Ethereum ( ETH ) ETF staking proposal following its review of the filing from Cboe BZX Exchange. If approved, this would be the first time an Ethereum ETF offers staking in the United States. By staking ETH, the plan seeks to enable the ETF to produce extra profits, which investors would then receive. The document states that all staked ether will be owned by the trust, setting it apart from models such as staking-as-a-service or delegated staking that have previously encountered regulatory opposition. The SEC has always had a stringent policy regarding proof-of-stake assets. The government categorized staking-related activities as securities under former Chair Gary Gensler, which led to many Ethereum ETF issuers removing staking from their registration statements. You might also like: XRP soars amid SEC’s latest move, meanwhile Yeti Ouro enters stage 3 But under the Trump administration, the SEC has adopted a more pro-crypto stance, creating a dedicated crypto task force and reconsidering the classification of some tokens as securities. A more transparent legal framework for staking, according to analysts, may encourage wider adoption, especially among institutions looking for more yield options in the digital asset market. The proposal coincides with an increase in institutional demand for Ethereum exchange-traded funds. According to recent 13F filings, ownership in ETH ETFs increased from 4.8% to 14.5% in Q4 2024, whilst ownership of Bitcoin ETFs decreased marginally from 22.3% to 21.5%. ETH ETF staking is also seen by many as a major catalyst that might boost the price of ETH. In a related development, the SEC’s recent acknowledgment of Bitwise, 21Shares, and Grayscale’s registrations for Ripple ( XRP ) spot ETFs sparked speculation about a broader adoption of crypto-based ETFs. Given the growing regulatory shifts, the next few months could be critical for Ethereum, XRP, and other digital assets seeking institutional adoption.

In a significant move that’s sending ripples through the digital asset space, South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) is stepping up its game. Get ready for enhanced scrutiny as the FSS announces its 2024 inspection plan, with a laser focus on virtual asset service providers (VASPs). This isn’t just a routine check-up; it’s a determined effort to ensure crypto businesses in South Korea are playing by the rules – both written and unwritten. Why the Increased Scrutiny on Crypto Businesses? South Korea has emerged as a major hub for cryptocurrency trading and innovation. However, with rapid growth comes the need for robust oversight. The FSS’s decision to tighten inspections reflects a global trend towards greater regulation of the crypto sector, aiming to protect investors and maintain financial stability. But what’s driving this urgency? Here are a few key factors: Investor Protection: The primary goal is to safeguard investors from potential risks associated with the volatile crypto market, including fraud, market manipulation, and inadequate security measures. Combating Illicit Activities: Cryptocurrencies have been sometimes linked to illicit activities like money laundering and terrorist financing. Stricter regulations aim to curb these risks and ensure the integrity of the financial system. Ensuring Fair Market Practices: The FSS wants to ensure a level playing field for all participants in the crypto market. This includes monitoring for insider trading, unfair trading practices, and ensuring transparent operations of crypto businesses . Alignment with International Standards: Global regulatory bodies are increasingly focusing on crypto assets. South Korea’s enhanced oversight can be seen as an effort to align with international standards and best practices in regulating digital assets. What Will the Inspections Entail for VASPs? The FSS’s inspections are not just about ticking boxes. They are comprehensive evaluations to ensure VASPs are truly compliant. Here’s what virtual asset service providers can expect: Legal and Regulatory Adherence: The FSS will meticulously check if VASPs are adhering to all relevant laws and regulations, including the Act on Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Transaction Information. This includes proper registration, anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. Voluntary Compliance Rule Checks: Beyond legal requirements, the FSS will also assess adherence to voluntary compliance rules established by industry bodies and the platforms themselves. This signifies a move towards fostering a culture of self-regulation alongside mandatory rules. Operational Risk Assessment: Inspections will delve into the operational risks associated with VASPs, including cybersecurity measures, system stability, and business continuity plans. The goal is to ensure platforms are resilient and can withstand potential disruptions. Consumer Protection Measures: A critical aspect will be evaluating how VASPs protect their users. This includes examining measures for handling customer complaints, dispute resolution mechanisms, and the clarity and fairness of terms of service. Financial Stability Review: The FSS will likely assess the financial health of VASPs to ensure they are financially sound and can meet their obligations to customers. This might include reviewing capital adequacy and risk management frameworks. The Role of the Korean Regulator in Shaping Crypto Landscape The Korean regulator , the FSS, plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of the cryptocurrency landscape in South Korea. Its actions and policies have significant implications for both domestic and international crypto markets. Consider these points to understand the influence of the Korean regulator : Aspect Impact of Korean Regulator Market Stability Regulations aim to reduce volatility and prevent market manipulation, fostering a more stable trading environment. Investor Confidence Enhanced oversight can boost investor confidence by signaling a safer and more regulated market. Innovation and Growth While regulations can be perceived as restrictive, they can also foster sustainable growth by building trust and attracting institutional investment in the long run. Global Influence As a major crypto market, South Korea’s regulatory approach can influence global standards and policies. Compliance is Key for VASPs: Navigating the Inspection Landscape For VASPs operating in South Korea, compliance is not just a legal obligation; it’s crucial for long-term sustainability and success. Here’s what businesses should focus on to navigate the intensifying inspection landscape: Proactive Compliance Measures: Don’t wait for inspections to begin. Implement robust AML/KYC procedures, cybersecurity protocols, and customer protection measures proactively. Regular Audits and Reviews: Conduct regular internal audits and seek external reviews to identify and address any compliance gaps before the FSS comes knocking. Employee Training: Ensure all employees are well-trained on regulatory requirements and compliance procedures. A well-informed team is your first line of defense. Transparent Communication: Maintain open and transparent communication with the FSS and other regulatory bodies. A collaborative approach can be beneficial. Legal Counsel: Engage with legal experts specializing in cryptocurrency regulations to stay updated on the evolving legal landscape and ensure full compliance. Looking Ahead: What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? The FSS’s intensified inspections signal a maturing phase for the South Korean crypto market. While some may view stricter regulations as a hurdle, they are ultimately aimed at creating a more secure, transparent, and sustainable ecosystem. For investors and market participants, this means: Increased Security: Enhanced regulations should lead to greater security and protection for crypto investors. Greater Legitimacy: Stricter compliance can enhance the legitimacy of the crypto industry in the eyes of traditional financial institutions and the public. Potential Market Consolidation: The cost of compliance may lead to consolidation in the VASP market, with smaller players potentially merging or exiting. Long-Term Growth: A well-regulated market can attract more institutional investment and foster long-term, sustainable growth for the crypto sector in South Korea. In conclusion, the Korean regulator’s move to tighten inspections on crypto businesses is a significant development. It underscores the global trend towards greater oversight of the digital asset space and highlights South Korea’s commitment to fostering a responsible and secure crypto ecosystem. For VASPs , embracing compliance is not just about avoiding penalties; it’s about building trust, ensuring long-term viability, and contributing to the sustainable growth of the cryptocurrency industry.

40567317,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131064,1740020874,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Decoding BoJ’s Cautious Stance: Takata’s Silence on JGB Yields Sparks Market Speculation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/decoding-boj-takata-jgb-yields/,"In the ever-turbulent world of cryptocurrency and forex trading, every whisper from central bankers can trigger seismic shifts. Recently, Bank of Japan (BoJ) Board Member Hajime Takata’s remarks, or rather his deliberate lack of them, have sent ripples through the markets. Traders and analysts are keenly dissecting his statement – “won’t comment on Japanese government bond (JGB) yield levels” – trying to decipher the underlying message. What does this silence from a key BoJ official truly mean for the future of Japan’s monetary policy and the trajectory of the Yen, particularly against the US Dollar ( USD/JPY )? Let’s delve into the nuances of Takata’s comments and explore their potential impact. Why Takata’s Silence on JGB Yields Speaks Volumes When a central bank official, especially one as influential as BoJ’s Takata , chooses not to comment on a critical aspect like JGB yields , it’s often more telling than any explicit statement. Here’s a breakdown of what his silence, coupled with his other remarks, suggests: Market Sensitivity: Directly commenting on specific yield levels could be interpreted as market manipulation or forward guidance, something central banks generally avoid, especially after abandoning Yield Curve Control (YCC). Takata’s silence suggests a desire to let the market discover the equilibrium without direct BoJ influence. Acknowledging Market Forces: By stating that long-term interest rates are moving in line with Japan’s economy, Takata implicitly acknowledges the market’s role in price discovery. This is a departure from the YCC era where the BoJ actively controlled the yield curve. Vigilance over Volatility: While stepping back from direct yield control, Takata emphasizes the need to be vigilant against “any sharp rise in market volatility.” This hints at a balancing act – allowing market forces to operate while standing ready to intervene if volatility becomes excessive and disruptive. Navigating Japan’s Economic Landscape: Inflation and Interest Rates Takata’s broader comments provide further clues about the BoJ’s thinking. Let’s examine the key takeaways related to inflation and interest rates: Negative Real Interest Rates Persist: The acknowledgment that real interest rates remain negative indicates that despite recent policy adjustments, the BoJ is still in a relatively accommodative stance. This could be seen as a cautious approach, ensuring continued economic support. Inflation Focus Beyond Core: While the BoJ primarily focuses on core inflation (excluding fresh food), Takata highlights the awareness that rising fresh food costs can impact household inflation expectations. This suggests a holistic view of inflation, considering broader price pressures. Neutral Rate Uncertainty: The closer Japan gets to a neutral interest rate, the harder it becomes to pinpoint the exact level, according to Takata. This reinforces the data-dependent approach the BoJ is likely to adopt, avoiding pre-committed paths for future rate hikes. No Specific Rate Hike Targets: Takata explicitly states “No specific target, timing for further rate hikes.” Future decisions will hinge on corporate activity, economic data, and market movements. This underscores the BoJ’s flexible and reactive policy stance. ETF Holdings: A Deliberate Approach to Unwinding The BoJ’s massive ETF holdings are a legacy of past aggressive easing policies. Takata’s comments on this front are equally revealing: No Immediate Sale Debate: It’s “still not at [the] stage to debate sale of the BoJ’s ETF holdings.” This suggests that unwinding the ETF portfolio is not an immediate priority and will likely be a gradual, long-term process. Careful Deliberation Required: Takata emphasizes that “how to unload BoJ’s ETF holdings is something the BoJ must take time to deliberate.” This highlights the complexity and potential market impact of such a move. A hasty or poorly communicated approach could trigger market instability. Market Reaction and USD/JPY Dynamics The immediate market reaction to Takata’s comments saw USD/JPY trading slightly lower. This could be attributed to: Uncertainty Aversion: Takata’s cautious tone and lack of specific guidance might have introduced a degree of uncertainty, leading to some Yen strength as a safe-haven asset. No Hawkish Signals: The absence of any hawkish signals regarding imminent rate hikes or aggressive policy tightening could have tempered expectations of further Yen appreciation, leading to a modest USD/JPY decline. However, the overall impact on USD/JPY remains relatively contained. The currency pair is still influenced by a multitude of factors, including broader US dollar strength, global risk sentiment, and interest rate differentials between the US and Japan. The Broader Implications for Forex and Crypto Markets While Takata’s comments directly relate to JGB yields and monetary policy in Japan, they have broader implications for forex and even cryptocurrency markets: Forex Volatility: Central bank communications, or the lack thereof, are key drivers of forex volatility. Traders need to closely monitor BoJ statements and actions to anticipate potential shifts in USD/JPY and other Yen pairs. Global Monetary Policy Interplay: The BoJ’s cautious approach is part of a global landscape where central banks are navigating complex economic conditions. The divergence or convergence of monetary policy across major economies impacts global capital flows and risk appetite, influencing both forex and crypto markets. Risk Sentiment and Safe Havens: Uncertainty surrounding central bank policy can influence risk sentiment. In times of uncertainty, safe-haven assets like the Japanese Yen may see increased demand, potentially impacting crypto markets as well, although the correlation is complex and varies. Conclusion: A Wait-and-See Approach from the BoJ BoJ Board Member Takata’s recent remarks, characterized by a deliberate silence on JGB yields and a cautious tone on future policy, signal a wait-and-see approach from the Bank of Japan. The BoJ is navigating a delicate path, aiming to normalize monetary policy gradually while remaining vigilant about market volatility and economic uncertainties. For traders in forex and crypto markets, understanding these nuances is crucial for anticipating potential market movements and making informed decisions. The focus remains squarely on incoming economic data, corporate activity, and global market dynamics as the BoJ charts its course forward.

40567318,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131065,1740020977,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Japanese Yen’s Powerful Surge: Riding High on BoJ-Fed Policy Divergence,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/japanese-yen-powerful-surge/,"In the fast-paced world of currency trading, shifts in central bank policies can create powerful waves. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts watching global markets, understanding these shifts is crucial as they often ripple through various asset classes. Currently, the Japanese Yen (JPY) is demonstrating remarkable strength against the US Dollar (USD), and the key driver? Divergent expectations from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the Federal Reserve (Fed). Let’s dive into why the Japanese Yen is gaining momentum and what it means for the USD/JPY pair. BoJ Rate Hike Expectations Fuel Japanese Yen Strength The Japanese Yen is currently enjoying a period of positive momentum, largely fueled by growing anticipation of further interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). After a prolonged period of ultra-loose monetary policy, the BoJ is hinting at a shift, a move that’s injecting strength into the Yen. Several factors are contributing to this hawkish outlook: Persistent Inflation Signals: Japan is showing increasing signs of broadening inflation, prompting BoJ officials to consider further tightening of monetary policy. BoJ Officials’ Hawkish Signals: Statements from BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda and Deputy Governor Himino have explicitly mentioned the possibility of additional rate hikes if economic conditions and price projections align with their targets. Board Member Hajime Takata further reinforced this by emphasizing the need for a gradual policy shift to mitigate potential upside price risks. Strong Economic Data: Japan’s robust Q4 GDP figures released earlier this week have bolstered expectations for policy tightening, suggesting the economy might be resilient enough to withstand rate increases. These factors combined are creating a strong tailwind for the Japanese Yen, making it an attractive currency as investors anticipate higher returns. Fed Rate Cut Bets Pressure US Dollar On the other side of the equation, the US Dollar is facing downward pressure due to increasing expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed). While the BoJ is hinting at tightening, the Fed is expected to ease its monetary policy, creating a significant divergence. Here’s why the USD is feeling the heat: Anticipation of Fed Rate Cuts: Market participants are increasingly pricing in expectations for the Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates in the near future. This anticipation weakens the appeal of the US Dollar as higher interest rates typically attract investment. FOMC Meeting Minutes in Focus: Traders are keenly awaiting the release of the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. These minutes are expected to provide further clues about the Fed’s future interest rate path. A dovish tone in the minutes could further solidify expectations of rate cuts and intensify pressure on the USD. This contrasting policy outlook – a potentially hawkish BoJ versus a dovish Fed – is the primary driver behind the current strength of the Japanese Yen against the US Dollar. USD/JPY Pair Under Pressure Amid Policy Divergence The divergent monetary policy expectations between the BoJ and the Fed are directly impacting the USD/JPY currency pair. The pair has been trending downwards, reflecting the Yen’s strength and the Dollar’s weakness. Here’s a breakdown of the current situation: Downward Trajectory: The USD/JPY pair has been consistently sliding, reaching the 151.70-151.65 area, indicating a clear bearish trend. Technical Levels in Play: From a technical standpoint, the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) around 152.65 is acting as immediate resistance. Further resistance lies at the 153.00 and 153.30-153.35 zones. Conversely, the 151.00 level is a crucial support, and a break below this could accelerate further declines. Market Sentiment: The overall market sentiment suggests continued downside for USD/JPY as long as the BoJ rate hike expectations remain intact and the Fed is anticipated to cut rates. The narrowing interest rate differential between Japan and the US further encourages flows towards the Yen, adding to the downward pressure on the USD/JPY pair. Technical Outlook for USD/JPY: Key Levels to Watch Understanding the technical levels is crucial for traders navigating the USD/JPY pair. Here’s a summary of key technical points: Level Significance 152.65 200-day SMA Resistance 153.00 & 153.30-153.35 Further Resistance Zones 154.75-154.80 Last Week’s Swing High (Supply Zone) 151.75 Immediate Support (Asian Session Trough) 151.25 Overnight Swing Low (Next Support) 151.00 Critical Psychological Support 150.00 Psychological Support Level 148.65 December 2024 Low (Major Support) For bullish traders, reclaiming and decisively clearing the resistance zones mentioned above is essential for any potential upward momentum. Conversely, for bearish traders, a sustained break below the 151.00 mark could open the door for a deeper decline towards the 150.00 and even 149.00 levels. FOMC Minutes: A Crucial Event for USD/JPY Traders The upcoming release of the FOMC meeting minutes is a highly anticipated event for USD/JPY traders. These minutes provide valuable insights into the Federal Reserve’s thinking and future policy direction. Here’s why they matter: Policy Outlook Clues: Investors will scrutinize the minutes for any hints about the timing and pace of potential interest rate cuts by the Fed. Vote Split Analysis: The minutes reveal the voting pattern of FOMC members, offering a deeper understanding of the committee’s consensus and potential dissenting views. Market Impact: A dovish tone in the FOMC minutes is likely to further weaken the US Dollar, potentially exacerbating the downward pressure on the USD/JPY pair. Conversely, a hawkish surprise could provide some support to the USD. Traders should closely monitor the FOMC minutes release at 19:00 GMT on Wednesday, February 19, 2025, as it could trigger significant volatility in the USD/JPY market. Conclusion: Yen’s Ascendancy Driven by Policy Divergence In conclusion, the Japanese Yen is currently demonstrating considerable strength against the US Dollar, primarily driven by the diverging monetary policy paths of the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve. The BoJ’s hints at further rate hikes, contrasted with expectations of Fed rate cuts, are creating a compelling narrative for Yen strength. For traders in the forex and crypto markets, keeping a close eye on the USD/JPY pair and the upcoming FOMC minutes is crucial, as these factors are likely to dictate the pair’s trajectory in the near term. The **powerful** combination of BoJ hawkishness and Fed dovishness presents a fascinating dynamic in the currency markets, with the Japanese Yen poised to potentially maintain its front-foot stance.

Despite early dips, the precious metal has bounced back, maintaining its position near record highs. Is this a temporary reprieve or a sign of sustained strength? Let’s delve into the factors driving the current gold price action and what to expect as we await crucial economic data. Gold Price Recovers Ground: A Rocky Start to the Day After starting the day with a slight negative bias, gold price quickly found its footing, trading comfortably above the $2,900 mark. This resilience comes as investors navigate a complex landscape of economic indicators and global uncertainties. The initial dip can be attributed to profit-taking after gold’s recent surge to record levels. However, the underlying bullish sentiment remains strong, fueled by concerns over trade wars and expectations of Federal Reserve policy easing. FOMC Minutes on the Horizon: Will They Trigger the Next Gold Rally? All eyes are now on the upcoming release of the FOMC minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting. These minutes are keenly awaited by market participants for clues about the future direction of US monetary policy. Specifically, investors are eager to gauge the Fed’s stance on interest rate cuts. Why is this so important for gold? Rate Cut Expectations: Lower interest rates generally weaken the US Dollar, making gold, which is priced in dollars, more attractive to investors holding other currencies. Dollar Weakness: A dovish tone in the FOMC minutes , suggesting a higher likelihood of rate cuts, could further undermine the US Dollar and provide a significant boost to gold price . Safe-Haven Appeal: Conversely, if the minutes reveal a more hawkish stance, it could strengthen the dollar and potentially lead to a temporary pullback in gold. However, any dip might be short-lived given the prevailing uncertainties. The FOMC minutes are more than just a historical record; they are a potential catalyst for the next major move in the gold price . Traders will be scrutinizing every word for hints about the Fed’s thinking and future actions. Trade War Fears Reignite: A Bullish Tailwind for Gold Adding to the bullish narrative for gold are renewed fears of a global trade war . President Trump’s tariff plans are once again in the spotlight, raising concerns about escalating trade tensions between major economies. In times of economic uncertainty and geopolitical instability, gold shines as a safe-haven asset. Here’s why trade war anxieties are gold’s ally: Economic Uncertainty: Trade wars disrupt global supply chains, dampen economic growth, and increase market volatility. This environment drives investors towards safe-haven assets like gold. Dollar Diversification: As trade tensions rise, countries may look to diversify away from the US Dollar, potentially increasing demand for gold as an alternative reserve asset. Inflation Hedge: Some believe that trade wars can lead to inflationary pressures, and gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation, further boosting its appeal. The specter of a trade war is not new, but its resurgence is providing a significant layer of support for gold price , limiting any potential downside. Rate Cut Bets Firm Up: Fueling Gold’s Ascent The market consensus is increasingly leaning towards further rate cut s by the Federal Reserve this year. Recent economic data, including weaker-than-expected retail sales and mixed inflation signals, have reinforced these expectations. Currently, Fed Funds Futures are pricing in a substantial possibility of a rate cut of at least 40 basis points by the end of the year. This dovish outlook is a major tailwind for gold: Impact of Rate Cut Expectations on Gold Factor Impact on Gold Price Lower Interest Rates Reduces the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold. Weaker US Dollar Makes gold cheaper for international buyers, increasing demand. Increased Investment Appeal Drives investors towards gold as a safe and potentially appreciating asset in a low-rate environment. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly’s recent comments, suggesting a cautious approach to interest rate adjustments, further solidify the expectation that rate cut s are on the horizon. This anticipation is a key driver behind gold’s sustained strength. Record High in Sight? Gold’s Technical Outlook Technically, gold price remains in a bullish consolidation phase after its impressive run to all-time highs. While the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates overbought conditions, suggesting potential for consolidation, the overall setup favors further upside. Key technical levels to watch: Resistance: The immediate hurdle remains the $2,940-$2,942 zone, coinciding with the record high reached earlier this month. A decisive break above this level could trigger a fresh wave of buying and propel gold to new peaks. Support: On the downside, immediate support lies around $2,925, followed by the psychological $2,900 mark and the $2,878-$2,876 range. A break below the latter could signal a deeper correction. Bullish Bias: Despite potential short-term pullbacks, the prevailing technical picture suggests that the path of least resistance for gold price remains upwards. For gold bulls, the focus is now on breaching the record high barrier. A successful breakout could unleash significant pent-up demand and confirm the continuation of the long-term uptrend. Actionable Insights for Gold Traders Monitor FOMC Minutes: Pay close attention to the tone and details of the FOMC minutes release. A dovish stance could be a strong buy signal for gold. Track Trade War Developments: Stay informed about any news related to US tariff policies and global trade tensions. Escalation in trade war rhetoric is typically positive for gold. Watch Key Support and Resistance Levels: Keep an eye on the technical levels mentioned above. A break above $2,942 could be a trigger to add to long positions, while a break below $2,876 might warrant caution. Consider Dollar Movements: The US Dollar’s performance will continue to be a crucial factor influencing gold price . Dollar weakness generally translates to gold strength. Conclusion: Gold’s Golden Opportunity? Gold’s resilience in the face of early selling pressure highlights the underlying strength of the market. Fueled by trade war fears, expectations of rate cut s, and the upcoming FOMC minutes , gold is poised for potential further gains. While short-term volatility is always possible, the fundamental and technical outlook for gold remains constructive. Will gold break through its record high and embark on a new ascent? The coming days and weeks will be crucial in determining the next chapter in gold’s fascinating journey.

Despite fresh trade tensions sparked by US President Donald Trump and mixed economic data, the AUD/USD pair is holding steady. All eyes are now on the upcoming release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes, which could be a pivotal moment for the future direction of both currencies. Are you ready to dive into the factors influencing the currency market and what the FOMC Minutes might unveil? Australian Dollar’s Quiet Strength Amidst Global Uncertainty The Australian Dollar has demonstrated surprising strength, appreciating even as the US Dollar faces headwinds. This comes despite new tariff threats from the US, a move that typically fuels risk aversion and could pressure currencies like the AUD. Let’s break down the key factors at play: Wage Growth Misses Expectations: Australia’s Wage Price Index for Q4 2024 rose by 0.7% QoQ, slightly below the 0.8% forecast. While this might seem negative, the annual growth remains at a solid 3.2%. This data point offers a nuanced picture of the Australian economy. RBA Rate Cut Priced In: The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) recently cut its Official Cash Rate (OCR) to 4.10%, the first cut in four years. This was largely anticipated by the market, and surprisingly, didn’t trigger a massive AUD sell-off, suggesting much of the dovish sentiment was already factored into the price. US Dollar Under Pressure: Conversely, the US Dollar is experiencing depreciation as US Treasury yields decline, even with hawkish statements from some Federal Reserve officials. This divergence is creating an interesting dynamic in the AUD/USD pair. Why is the US Dollar Losing its Shine? Despite signals from some Fed members suggesting a cautious approach to interest rates , the US Dollar is struggling to find strong bullish momentum. Several factors are contributing to this weakness: Trump’s Tariff Threats Loom Large: President Trump’s announcement of potential 25% tariffs on foreign cars, and higher duties on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, has injected significant uncertainty into the market. These protectionist measures could dampen global trade and negatively impact the US economy in the long run, paradoxically weakening the USD. Mixed US Economic Data: Recent US Retail Sales figures showed a sharper-than-expected decline in January (-0.9%), contrasting with previous strong figures. This inconsistency in economic data is making it harder for the market to confidently predict the Fed’s next moves. Hawkish Fedspeak Not Enough: While San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, and Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman have expressed caution about premature rate cuts and highlighted persistent inflation, their words haven’t provided sustained support to the USD. The market seems to be waiting for more definitive signals. FOMC Minutes: The Potential Game-Changer All eyes are now fixed on the release of the FOMC Minutes. These minutes offer a detailed glimpse into the discussions and considerations that shaped the Federal Reserve’s recent policy decisions. Traders are eagerly awaiting this publication to glean insights into: Aspect Significance for Traders Vote Split Indicates the level of consensus within the FOMC and the strength of different policy viewpoints. Policy Outlook Provides clues about the Fed’s future stance on interest rates and monetary policy, influencing USD direction. Inflation Concerns Details the depth of concern about persistent inflation and the Fed’s willingness to act aggressively. Economic Growth Assessment Reveals the Fed’s perspective on the strength and sustainability of US economic growth, impacting risk sentiment. A hawkish tone in the FOMC Minutes, suggesting a greater likelihood of maintaining higher interest rates for longer, could provide a significant boost to the US Dollar. Conversely, a dovish stance, hinting at potential rate cuts sooner than anticipated, would likely weaken the USD and potentially benefit the Australian Dollar. AUD/USD Technical Outlook: Bullish Momentum Building? From a technical perspective, the AUD/USD pair is exhibiting a bullish bias. Trading around 0.6360, the pair is moving within an ascending channel pattern. Key technical indicators suggest continued upward potential: Ascending Channel: This pattern typically indicates a bullish trend, suggesting further potential gains for the AUD/USD. Relative Strength Index (RSI): With the 14-day RSI above 50, momentum favors the upside, reinforcing the bullish outlook. Key Resistance and Support Levels: Resistance: The upper boundary of the ascending channel and the psychological level of 0.6400 are key resistance points. Support: The 9-day EMA at 0.6327 and the 14-day EMA at 0.6309 offer immediate support, with a stronger support zone near the lower channel boundary at 0.6290. Australian Dollar Performance Snapshot Let’s look at how the Australian Dollar is performing against other major currencies today: USD EUR GBP JPY CAD AUD NZD CHF USD -0.02% -0.06% -0.14% -0.03% -0.16% -0.28% -0.01% EUR 0.02% -0.04% -0.08% -0.02% -0.14% -0.26% 0.00% GBP 0.06% 0.04% -0.08% 0.03% -0.10% -0.22% 0.05% JPY 0.14% 0.08% 0.08% 0.08% -0.05% -0.18% 0.10% CAD 0.03% 0.02% -0.03% -0.08% -0.13% -0.25% 0.01% AUD 0.16% 0.14% 0.10% 0.05% 0.13% -0.12% 0.16% NZD 0.28% 0.26% 0.22% 0.18% 0.25% 0.12% 0.27% CHF 0.00% -0.01% -0.05% -0.10% -0.01% -0.16% -0.27% Table: Percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against major currencies today. As you can see, the Australian Dollar is showing strength against the US Dollar and several other major currencies, highlighting its current outperformance in the currency market . Conclusion: Brace for Potential Volatility The Australian Dollar is currently navigating a complex landscape of global economic factors. While showing resilience against a weaker US Dollar, the AUD/USD pair remains sensitive to risk sentiment and, crucially, the signals emanating from the Federal Reserve. The FOMC Minutes release is a critical event that could inject significant volatility into the currency market . Traders should closely monitor the details within the minutes to anticipate potential shifts in interest rates expectations and the resulting impact on the Australian Dollar and the US Dollar .

Will Michael Saylor’s imminent BTC purchases and ETF filing speculation drive Bitcoin price rebound above $100,000 in the days ahead? Bitcoin Reclaims $97,000 as Trump Signals Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire Talks Bitcoin’s price rebounded sharply on Thursday, gaining 4% to reclaim the $97,000 level amid renewed optimism surrounding U.S.-Russia diplomatic engagement. This shift follows reports confirming that Washington and Moscow have resumed diplomatic talks, potentially laying the groundwork for a resolution to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Bitcoin Price Action (BTCUSD) | Feb 20, 2025 Market sentiment had deteriorated last week after hotter-than-expected U.S. CPI data reinforced expectations of prolonged US Federal Reserve (Fed) tightening. Investors reduced BTC exposure in anticipation of further rate hikes, triggering a pullback to $93,388. However, geopolitical developments appear to have offset these concerns. Reuters reported on Feb. 18 that U.S. and Russia had agreed to reopen diplomatic communications channels, triggering positive reactions across global financial markets. Bitcoin price mirrored the risk-on sentiment, rallying 4% within 24 hours of the announcement. In the latest developments, Kremlin official sources have hinted that – Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump could meet this month, in a first face-to-face encounter between leaders of both nation since the war began. With market confidence improving, BTC price trajectory now hinges on continued geopolitical de-escalation and investor positioning ahead of key economic data releases. How Will Bitcoin React to a Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire? Geopolitical risk has played a significant role in Bitcoin’s volatility since 2022, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict contributing to inflationary pressures and market instability. However, a potential ceasefire could reshape global economic conditions, particularly regarding energy prices, trade flows, and regulatory policy. Crypto Traders price-in 67% chance of Russia vs. Ukraine Ceasfire in 2025 | Source: PolyMarket, Feb 20, 2025 While major political voices in Europe and the UK called for further funding to support Ukraine’s defense, crypto bettors on the predictions market platform Polymarket have priced in a 67% chance of a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia in 2025. This confirms that majority of market watchers are anticipating a ceasefire in the coming months. A de-escalation scenario could lead to the lifting of economic sanctions, the reopening of critical trade routes, and an increase in Russian oil and gas exports. This would likely reduce energy-driven inflation, reinforcing the case for less hawkish Fed tweaks in the coming months. Beyond macroeconomic factors, crypto market dynamics could shift as well. A relaxation of financial restrictions may allow Russian investors to re-enter global crypto markets, increasing Bitcoin’s demand. Additionally, a more stable geopolitical backdrop may encourage institutional capital inflows into digital assets, particularly as ETF-driven adoption gains momentum. With the ongoing 4% BTC price rebound fueled by both geopolitical optimism and institutional accumulation, traders will closely watch upcoming developments for confirmation of a ceasefire. If positive momentum continues, BTC could break through $100,000, testing key resistance levels in the days ahead. Strategy Total Bitcoin Holdings as of Feb 20, 2025 | Source: SaylorTracker Notably, Michaell Saylor-led firm Strategy, (formerly known as Microstrategy) has announced a decision to raise another $2 billion in debt instruments to fund additional BTC purchases. With altcoin ETF filing nearing approval, an end to the Russian vs. Ukraine could spark the next wave of institutional-driven rally for top-ranked cryptocurrencies including BTC. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Multi-day Closes Above $98,000 Could Mark Local Bottom Bitcoin price forecast chart below shows BTC hovering near $97,000, rebounding from the lower Bollinger Band ($94,339) as buyers regain control. The recent two-day rally of 3.78% suggests a potential bottoming pattern forming around the $94,000-$96,000 range. However, a definitive shift in momentum hinges on BTC securing multiple daily closes above $98,000, aligning with the mid-Bollinger Band and key resistance zone. Bitcoin price forecast | BTCUSDT The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 46.66 remains below the neutral 50 level, indicating weak bullish momentum but potential upside if it crosses above its signal line (44.16). A confirmed RSI breakout could accelerate BTC’s move toward the psychological $100,000 mark. Conversely, failure to reclaim $98,000 may trigger another retest of the $94,000 support, with deeper downside risk toward $92,000 if sellers strengthen. Volume analysis highlights rising accumulation, with a notable 41.44K BTC traded over the last two days, reinforcing buying interest near current levels. If geopolitical optimism persists and Bitcoin ETFs maintain steady inflows, bullish continuation remains the favored scenario. However, traders should remain cautious of short-term profit-taking near resistance.

The United Kingdom just dropped a bombshell – inflation is hotter than expected, and it’s sending ripples across the Forex markets. January’s UK CPI inflation data has surged to a startling 3% year-over-year, significantly surpassing the anticipated 2.8%. This unexpected jump has ignited speculation about the Bank of England’s next moves and is currently keeping a firm floor under the GBP/USD pair. Let’s dive into what this means for your trades and the broader economic landscape. Why is UK CPI Inflation Surging and What Does It Mean for GBP/USD? The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reveal a significant uptick in the UK CPI inflation . Here’s a breakdown of the key numbers: Headline CPI (YoY): Rose to 3% in January, up from 2.5% in December and above the 2.8% forecast. Core CPI (YoY): Increased to 3.7%, matching expectations but still higher than December’s 3.2%. Services Inflation (YoY): Climbed to a worrying 5% in January, compared to 4.4% the previous month. Monthly CPI (MoM): Decreased by 0.1% in January, less than the expected -0.3% decline. This hotter-than-expected inflation print signals persistent price pressures within the UK economy, moving further away from the Bank of England’s (BoE) 2% target. For GBP/USD , this initially translated to resilience. The pair held its ground above the 1.2600 level, as traders digested the implications for future BoE policy. How Did Forex Markets React to the Inflation Shock? While the initial reaction in Forex markets was muted, with GBP/USD remaining relatively stable, the underlying sentiment is shifting. The table below illustrates the British Pound’s performance against major currencies today: USD EUR GBP JPY CAD AUD NZD CHF USD -0.09% -0.09% -0.27% -0.04% -0.20% -0.38% -0.06% EUR 0.09% -0.00% -0.16% 0.04% -0.11% -0.29% 0.03% GBP 0.09% 0.00% -0.19% 0.05% -0.11% -0.29% 0.03% JPY 0.27% 0.16% 0.19% 0.22% 0.06% -0.13% 0.20% CAD 0.04% -0.04% -0.05% -0.22% -0.16% -0.33% -0.02% AUD 0.20% 0.11% 0.11% -0.06% 0.16% -0.18% 0.14% NZD 0.38% 0.29% 0.29% 0.13% 0.33% 0.18% 0.32% CHF 0.06% -0.03% -0.03% -0.20% 0.02% -0.14% -0.32% Heatmap showing percentage changes of major currencies. Source: Bitcoin World Team As you can see, the British Pound demonstrated strength against the US Dollar, highlighting the potential bullish implications of persistent inflation. Will the Bank of England Rethink Rate Cuts Amidst Rising Inflation? This inflation report puts the Bank of England (BoE) in a tricky spot. Earlier this month, the BoE already lowered interest rates, signaling a potential easing cycle. However, Governor Andrew Bailey emphasized a cautious approach, stressing the need for underlying inflation to ease further before considering more cuts. The hotter-than-expected January CPI data throws a wrench into these plans. Key considerations for the BoE include: Deviation from Target: Inflation is now significantly above the 2% target, increasing pressure on the BoE to act. Services Inflation: The alarming rise in services inflation is particularly concerning, as it often indicates stickier, more persistent price pressures. Market Expectations: The data challenges market expectations of aggressive rate cuts, potentially forcing a recalibration of BoE policy outlook. TD Securities analysts had previewed this potential rebound in inflation, attributing it partly to temporary factors like airfares. However, even with temporary factors at play, the overall inflation level is likely to make the BoE uncomfortable and could lead to a more hawkish stance. Trading GBP/USD: Key Levels to Watch After the Inflation Data From a technical perspective, as Bitcoin World’s Asian Session Lead Analyst, Dhwani Mehta, points out, GBP/USD is navigating crucial resistance levels. Here’s what traders should monitor: Resistance: The pair is testing resistance around 1.2605. A break above the 100-day SMA at 1.2665 could pave the way towards 1.2700 and even the 200-day SMA at 1.2788. Support: Immediate support lies at the confluence of the 21-day and 50-day SMAs around 1.2460. A break below this could lead to further declines towards the trendline support from the January 13 low at 1.2357. Technical Indicators: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains above 50, and a potential Bull Cross formation (21-day SMA crossing above the 50-day SMA) suggests continued upward momentum. In essence, a stronger inflation print supports a bullish outlook for GBP/USD as it diminishes expectations of aggressive BoE rate cuts. Conversely, weaker inflation data could reignite rate cut bets and trigger a potential GBP/USD correction. Inflation Explained: FAQs for Crypto and Forex Traders Understanding inflation is crucial for navigating both crypto and Forex markets. Here are some key FAQs: What is Inflation and Why Does It Matter? Inflation is simply the rate at which prices for goods and services are rising, eroding purchasing power over time. Central banks like the BoE aim to keep inflation at a target level (usually 2%) to ensure economic stability. High inflation can lead to: Decreased purchasing power Increased cost of borrowing Economic uncertainty Headline inflation includes all goods and services, while core inflation excludes volatile items like food and energy, providing a clearer picture of underlying price pressures. How Does CPI Measure Inflation? The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a primary tool for measuring inflation. It tracks changes in the prices of a basket of goods and services commonly consumed by households. Central banks often target core CPI as it’s considered a more reliable indicator of persistent inflation trends. When core CPI rises above the target, central banks typically raise interest rates to cool down the economy and curb inflation. Conversely, falling CPI can lead to interest rate cuts. Inflation’s Impact on Forex: Counterintuitive but True? It might seem surprising, but higher inflation can actually strengthen a currency. This is because central banks tend to raise interest rates to combat inflation. Higher interest rates attract foreign investment as investors seek better returns, increasing demand for the currency and pushing its value up. Gold vs. Inflation: Is Gold Still an Inflation Hedge? Historically, gold was seen as a safe-haven asset during inflationary periods. However, in today’s environment, the relationship is more nuanced. While gold can still act as a safe haven during extreme market turmoil, high inflation often prompts central banks to raise interest rates. Higher interest rates increase the opportunity cost of holding gold (which doesn’t yield interest), making interest-bearing assets more attractive. Therefore, in a high-inflation, rising-interest-rate environment, gold may not always perform as a traditional inflation hedge. Stay Ahead of the Curve in Forex Markets The UK CPI inflation surge is a stark reminder of the dynamic nature of economic data and its immediate impact on Forex markets . For crypto and Forex traders, staying informed and understanding these macroeconomic indicators is paramount. Keep a close watch on BoE communications and further UK economic releases to anticipate potential shifts in GBP/USD and broader market trends.

40567702,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131125,1740021741,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Verified: Coinbase Introduces Proof of Reserves for cbBTC, Boosting Crypto Transparency",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-proof-reserves-cbbtc/,"In a significant stride towards enhanced transparency within the cryptocurrency realm, Coinbase, a leading crypto exchange, has officially rolled out a dedicated proof-of-reserves (PoR) page for its wrapped Bitcoin token, cbBTC. This move, initially reported by BeInCrypto, aims to provide users with verifiable assurance regarding the backing of cbBTC with actual Bitcoin reserves. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the broader crypto ecosystem. What is Proof of Reserves and Why Does it Matter for cbBTC? Proof of Reserves (PoR) is a crucial concept in the world of cryptocurrency, especially for wrapped tokens like cbBTC. Essentially, it’s a process that allows a custodian or issuer of a token to publicly demonstrate that they hold sufficient reserves of the underlying asset to back the tokens they have issued. In the case of cbBTC, which is designed to be a wrapped version of Bitcoin on other blockchains, PoR verifies that Coinbase holds an equivalent amount of Bitcoin for all the cbBTC tokens in circulation. Why is this important? Think of wrapped tokens as representations of real assets in the crypto world. If you hold cbBTC, you’re essentially holding a token that is supposed to be backed 1:1 by Bitcoin held by Coinbase. Without proof of reserves, there’s always a lingering question: Does Coinbase really have all that Bitcoin they claim to have? PoR addresses this question head-on, offering verifiable evidence and building trust. Here’s a breakdown of why Proof of Reserves is a game-changer: Transparency and Trust: PoR injects a dose of much-needed transparency into the often opaque world of crypto. By publicly disclosing their Bitcoin reserves, Coinbase is fostering greater trust with its users and the wider crypto community. Reduced Risk of Fractional Reserves: In traditional finance, fractional reserve banking has been a source of instability. In crypto, the concern is similar – are custodians truly holding the assets they are supposed to be? PoR minimizes the risk of fractional reserves for cbBTC, ensuring each token is genuinely backed. Investor Confidence: For investors, especially institutional ones, proof of reserves is a critical factor in gaining confidence in crypto assets. It provides a level of security and assurance that is often demanded in traditional markets. Ecosystem Stability: When major players like Coinbase implement PoR, it sets a positive precedent for the entire crypto ecosystem. It encourages other exchanges and custodians to adopt similar practices, leading to a more stable and trustworthy environment. Coinbase’s Bold Step Towards Transparency: Introducing Proof of Reserves for cbBTC Coinbase’s unveiling of a dedicated PoR page for cbBTC is a significant step forward for the exchange and the crypto industry as a whole. According to the report, Coinbase is currently holding a substantial 26,525.15 BTC in reserves . This impressive figure backs a circulating supply of 26,461.05 cbBTC tokens spread across multiple prominent blockchains, including Ethereum, Base, Solana, and Arbitrum. This multi-chain support highlights cbBTC’s versatility and reach within the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. What’s even more reassuring is Coinbase’s decision to disclose the individual Bitcoin addresses where these reserves are held. This level of detail allows anyone to independently verify the existence and quantity of the Bitcoin reserves using blockchain explorers. It’s not just about taking Coinbase’s word for it; it’s about verifiable, on-chain evidence. This commitment to open verification is a hallmark of true transparency. Let’s break down the key figures and facts: Metric Value Bitcoin Reserves Held by Coinbase 26,525.15 BTC cbBTC Supply 26,461.05 tokens Blockchains Supported Ethereum, Base, Solana, Arbitrum Verification Method Publicly Disclosed Bitcoin Addresses This data paints a clear picture: Coinbase is maintaining a healthy reserve of Bitcoin that comfortably exceeds the circulating supply of cbBTC. The slight surplus in reserves (26,525.15 BTC reserves vs. 26,461.05 cbBTC supply) could be interpreted as a buffer, further enhancing the security and reliability of cbBTC. Addressing Centralization Concerns: How Proof of Reserves for cbBTC Builds Trust cbBTC, like many wrapped tokens, has faced scrutiny in the past, particularly regarding concerns about centralization. Critics, including prominent figures like Tron (TRX) founder Justin Sun, have voiced apprehensions about the centralized nature of wrapped Bitcoin solutions. The core concern revolves around the fact that a central entity (like Coinbase in this case) controls the underlying Bitcoin reserves. This centralization introduces potential risks, such as regulatory pressure or operational vulnerabilities, that are less prevalent in truly decentralized cryptocurrencies. Proof of Reserves directly addresses these centralization concerns by providing a mechanism for external verification. While it doesn’t eliminate centralization entirely, it significantly mitigates the risks associated with it. Here’s how: Reduced Reliance on Trust: PoR shifts the paradigm from blind trust to verifiable trust. Users no longer have to solely rely on Coinbase’s reputation; they can independently verify the reserves. Increased Accountability: By making their reserves public, Coinbase is holding itself accountable to the community. Any discrepancy between the cbBTC supply and Bitcoin reserves would be readily apparent, incentivizing Coinbase to maintain its commitment to full backing. Enhanced Security Perceptions: Transparency breeds confidence. Knowing that cbBTC is backed by verifiable Bitcoin reserves makes it a more attractive and secure option for users looking to utilize Bitcoin on different blockchains. While PoR is a powerful tool, it’s important to acknowledge that it’s not a complete solution to centralization risks. The ultimate ideal for many crypto purists is decentralization in every aspect. However, in the current landscape, where wrapped tokens play a vital role in bridging different blockchain ecosystems, proof of reserves represents a pragmatic and impactful step towards greater security and user confidence. It’s about making centralized solutions as transparent and trustworthy as possible. Benefits of cbBTC Proof of Reserves: A Win for Crypto Investors The introduction of proof of reserves for cbBTC is not just a procedural update; it brings tangible benefits to crypto investors and the broader DeFi space. Let’s explore some key advantages: Enhanced Security and Peace of Mind: For cbBTC holders, PoR translates to enhanced security and peace of mind. Knowing that your wrapped Bitcoin is truly backed by real Bitcoin reserves provides a strong sense of security, especially in a volatile market. Greater Utility for Wrapped Bitcoin: With increased confidence in cbBTC’s backing, users are more likely to utilize it in various DeFi applications across Ethereum, Solana, and other supported blockchains. This can unlock greater utility and liquidity for wrapped Bitcoin. Attracting Institutional Investment: Institutional investors, who often prioritize security and regulatory compliance, are more likely to engage with crypto assets that demonstrate robust transparency measures like PoR. Coinbase’s move could pave the way for increased institutional adoption of cbBTC and wrapped Bitcoin in general. Setting a New Industry Standard for Crypto Transparency: Coinbase, as a leading exchange, is setting a positive example for the industry. Their implementation of PoR for cbBTC could encourage other exchanges and wrapped token issuers to adopt similar transparency measures, leading to a more trustworthy and mature crypto market. Navigating the Landscape of Wrapped Bitcoin: Understanding cbBTC in the Broader Context cbBTC is not the only wrapped Bitcoin solution available in the crypto market. Projects like Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and renBTC also aim to bring Bitcoin to different blockchains, primarily Ethereum. Each of these solutions has its own approach and set of characteristics. Understanding cbBTC in this broader context is crucial for making informed decisions. While WBTC is currently the dominant player in the wrapped Bitcoin space in terms of market capitalization and adoption, cbBTC, backed by Coinbase, brings its own unique strengths to the table. Coinbase’s reputation, regulatory compliance, and now, its commitment to proof of reserves, position cbBTC as a compelling alternative. The multi-chain support for cbBTC, extending beyond Ethereum to Solana, Base, and Arbitrum, further broadens its appeal and potential use cases. Here’s a simplified comparison: Feature cbBTC (Coinbase) WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) Issuer Coinbase BitGo, Kyber Network, Ren, others (Decentralized Consortium) Proof of Reserves Yes (Publicly Disclosed Addresses) Yes (Audits and On-chain Data) Blockchains Supported Ethereum, Base, Solana, Arbitrum Primarily Ethereum (also others) Centralization Centralized (Coinbase) Somewhat Decentralized (Consortium) Ultimately, the choice between different wrapped Bitcoin solutions depends on individual user preferences and priorities. cbBTC, with its Coinbase backing and now, robust proof of reserves, presents a compelling option for those seeking a transparent and secure way to access Bitcoin on various blockchains. Conclusion: A Transparent Future for Wrapped Bitcoin Coinbase’s introduction of proof of reserves for cbBTC marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of wrapped Bitcoin and crypto transparency. By providing verifiable evidence of their Bitcoin reserves, Coinbase is not only enhancing the credibility of cbBTC but also setting a new benchmark for trust and accountability in the cryptocurrency industry. This move is a powerful signal that transparency is not just a buzzword but a core principle for the future of crypto. As the crypto landscape continues to mature, initiatives like proof of reserves will be instrumental in fostering wider adoption, building investor confidence, and paving the way for a more secure and transparent decentralized financial system.

U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have been a subject of intense interest and investment lately, experienced a significant shift. Data from Farside Investors revealed a combined net outflow of $60.7 million . This figure raises eyebrows and prompts crucial questions about the current sentiment surrounding Bitcoin and crypto investments. Let’s delve deeper into what this means for the market and individual investors. Decoding the Shocking Bitcoin ETF Outflows: What Happened on February 18th? On February 18th, the collective U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs landscape saw a notable change in investor behavior. While some ETFs continued to attract inflows, the overall picture was painted in red with a net outflow of $60.7 million. This aggregate number signifies that more capital was withdrawn from these ETFs than invested on that particular day. To understand the nuances, let’s break down the performance of individual ETFs: BlackRock’s IBIT: Bucking the trend, IBIT recorded a substantial net inflow of $68.4 million . This positive inflow suggests continued investor confidence in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF offering. Fidelity’s FBTC: In contrast, Fidelity’s FBTC faced a net outflow of $16.4 million . This indicates that on February 18th, more investors chose to withdraw funds from FBTC than deposit new capital. Bitwise’s BITB: The most significant outflow was observed in Bitwise’s BITB, which saw a net outflow of $112.7 million . This substantial withdrawal contributes heavily to the overall negative net outflow for the day. Other ETFs: The remaining spot Bitcoin ETFs reported no significant net inflows or outflows, indicating a relatively neutral investor activity for these funds on February 18th. This data paints a mixed picture within the Bitcoin ETF market . While BlackRock’s IBIT demonstrates robust investor interest, the significant outflows from Fidelity and Bitwise, particularly BITB, dragged the overall market sentiment down for the day. Why the Sudden Shift in Bitcoin Investment Sentiment? The question arises: what factors could have contributed to this net outflow in Bitcoin investment products? Several potential reasons could be at play: Profit Taking: After a period of positive price action in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, some investors might have decided to take profits. Selling ETF holdings could be a part of this profit-taking strategy. Market Volatility Concerns: The crypto market is inherently volatile. Increased volatility or perceived risks might lead some investors to reduce their exposure to Bitcoin ETFs, opting for safer assets or waiting for market stabilization. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic news, inflation data, interest rate decisions, and geopolitical events can all influence investor sentiment and risk appetite. Negative macroeconomic signals could trigger outflows from riskier assets like Bitcoin ETFs. Rotation into Other Assets: Investors might be reallocating capital from Bitcoin ETFs to other asset classes that appear more attractive at the moment, such as equities, bonds, or even other cryptocurrencies. ETF-Specific Factors: While less likely for established players like Fidelity and Bitwise, fund-specific issues or investor concerns related to particular ETF providers could also contribute to outflows. It’s crucial to remember that a single day’s net outflow does not necessarily indicate a long-term trend reversal. The Crypto ETF trends are influenced by a multitude of factors and require continuous monitoring and analysis over a longer period. BlackRock’s IBIT: A Silver Lining in the Outflow Cloud? Amidst the overall net outflows, BlackRock’s IBIT stands out as a beacon of continued investor confidence. The significant inflow into IBIT while other major ETFs experienced outflows suggests a few possibilities: Brand Trust and Reputation: BlackRock’s established reputation and massive scale in traditional finance might instill greater confidence among investors, especially institutional ones, compared to newer or smaller ETF providers in the crypto space. Lower Fees: IBIT’s fee structure might be more attractive to some investors compared to competitors, drawing in more capital even during periods of market uncertainty. Strategic Accumulation: Some investors might view the broader market dip or outflow as an opportunity to strategically accumulate more Bitcoin exposure through a trusted vehicle like IBIT, anticipating future price appreciation. BlackRock’s consistent positive inflows since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs highlight the power of brand recognition and perceived security in the nascent crypto ETF market. Navigating the Bitcoin ETF Landscape: Actionable Insights for Investors So, what should investors make of these recent Bitcoin ETF outflows? Here are some actionable insights: Don’t Panic Sell: A single day’s net outflow is not necessarily a cause for alarm. Avoid knee-jerk reactions based on short-term market fluctuations. Monitor Trends, Not Just Daily Data: Focus on longer-term trends in Bitcoin ETF flows and overall market sentiment rather than getting fixated on daily numbers. Diversify Your Portfolio: Bitcoin ETFs can be a part of a diversified investment strategy, but it’s crucial to avoid over-allocation to any single asset class, especially in volatile markets. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, macroeconomic developments, and regulatory updates that can impact the crypto market and Bitcoin ETFs. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals before making decisions about Bitcoin ETF investments. Crypto investments are inherently risky and not suitable for all investors. Conclusion: The Ever-Evolving Bitcoin ETF Story The $60.7 million net outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on February 18th serves as a reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the outflows raise some concerns, the continued strength of BlackRock’s IBIT and the complex interplay of market factors suggest that this is likely a temporary fluctuation rather than a fundamental shift in long-term investor sentiment. The Bitcoin ETF story is still being written, and ongoing monitoring, informed decision-making, and a balanced perspective are crucial for navigating this exciting yet volatile investment landscape.

40568028,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131128,1740022205,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Revolutionary STOs: A Promising Fundraising Avenue for Small Firms, Says Ex-Coinbase CTO",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stos-promising-fundraising-small-firms/,"Are you a small business owner tired of the complex and costly routes to raise capital? Imagine a world where fundraising is streamlined, accessible globally, and bypasses the traditional burdens of Wall Street. According to Balaji Srinivasan, the former CTO of cryptocurrency exchange giant Coinbase, this future might be closer than you think, thanks to Securities Token Offerings (STOs) . Srinivasan recently suggested that STOs could emerge as a game-changing alternative for small firms seeking capital, potentially overshadowing conventional methods like Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and Mergers & Acquisitions (M&As), especially under a Trump administration. Why STOs Could Be a Revolutionary Fundraising Tool for Small Firms? Srinivasan’s bold prediction hinges on the evolving regulatory landscape and the inherent advantages of Securities Token Offering . Let’s break down the key factors that are positioning STOs as a potentially revolutionary fundraising avenue for small firms : Bypassing IPO Burdens : The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), enacted in 2002, was intended to enhance corporate governance and financial disclosures. However, Srinivasan argues that it has inadvertently created significant hurdles for smaller companies aiming to go public via IPOs . The compliance costs and regulatory complexities associated with IPOs under SEC guidelines can be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming for small firms . STOs, in contrast, offer a potentially less cumbersome route to accessing public markets. Navigating M&A Roadblocks : Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As) have long been a strategy for growth and exit for businesses. However, Srinivasan points to a shift in regulatory attitude, particularly under Lina Khan’s FTC, where major M&As are facing increased scrutiny and blocks. While Srinivasan disagrees with this stance, he acknowledges that even a Trump administration has shown similar tendencies. This makes M&As a less certain path for small firms . Global Investor Access via Crypto : Perhaps the most compelling advantage of Securities Token Offering is its ability to tap into a global pool of investors through cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional securities offerings, STOs can leverage blockchain technology to offer tokens representing securities to investors worldwide, regardless of geographical limitations. This democratizes investment and opens up unprecedented fundraising opportunities for small firms in the US and beyond. Maintaining Independence : Another significant benefit highlighted by Srinivasan is that STOs allow companies to raise capital without relinquishing ownership stakes in the same way as traditional equity fundraising rounds or M&As. Investors in STOs purchase security tokens, which can represent various forms of investment contracts, but don’t necessarily translate to direct ownership or control. This empowers small firms to remain independent for longer, fostering innovation and competition. STOs vs. IPOs and M&As: A Quick Comparison To better understand why Srinivasan believes STOs are poised to become a more viable option, let’s compare them side-by-side with traditional IPOs and M&As: Feature Initial Public Offering (IPO) Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) Securities Token Offering (STO) Primary Goal Raise capital by selling shares to the public Growth, market expansion, exit strategy Raise capital through tokenized securities Regulatory Burden High (SEC, SOX compliance) Moderate to High (Antitrust, SEC depending on structure) Evolving but potentially lower than IPOs Investor Base Primarily institutional and accredited investors initially, then public Usually limited to strategic acquirers or larger companies Global, potentially wider range including retail and crypto investors Ownership Dilution Yes, significant equity dilution Complete or majority ownership transfer Potentially less direct ownership dilution, flexible token structures Cost & Time High cost, lengthy process (months to years) High cost, lengthy process (months to years) Potentially lower cost, faster process (weeks to months) Independence Reduced control due to public shareholders Loss of independence, company absorbed Maintains greater independence Are There Challenges to the STO Revolution? While the prospect of STOs as a superior fundraising mechanism is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the existing challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty : The regulatory landscape for STOs is still evolving globally. While the U.S. has provided some clarity, navigating securities laws and compliance across different jurisdictions can be complex. Clearer and harmonized regulations are needed for widespread adoption. Investor Education and Adoption : Securities Token Offering is a relatively new concept. Educating investors about the nature of security tokens, their risks and rewards, and the underlying technology is paramount. Mainstream investor adoption will take time and effort. Market Infrastructure : A robust ecosystem of exchanges, custodians, and service providers is essential for a thriving STO market. While progress is being made, the infrastructure is not as mature as traditional capital markets. Security and Trust : As with any cryptocurrency-related venture, security and trust are critical. Ensuring the security of token issuance, trading platforms, and investor assets is paramount to building confidence in the STO space. Actionable Insights for Small Firms Considering STOs For small firms exploring alternative fundraising strategies, STOs present a compelling option. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Educate Yourself : Dive deep into understanding Securities Token Offering , the regulatory requirements in your target jurisdictions, and the technology involved. Assess Your Needs : Evaluate your capital requirements, long-term goals, and tolerance for regulatory complexity. Determine if an STO aligns with your overall business strategy better than traditional IPOs or pursuing M&As . Seek Expert Advice : Consult with legal, financial, and technology experts specializing in STOs. Navigating the legal and technical aspects requires specialized knowledge. Build a Strong Community : Engage with the crypto and blockchain community. Building a strong online presence and community support can be crucial for a successful STO. Prioritize Compliance : Compliance with securities regulations is non-negotiable. Ensure your STO is structured to meet all applicable legal requirements. Conclusion: The Future of Fundraising Might Be Tokenized Balaji Srinivasan’s prediction underscores a potentially transformative shift in how small firms access capital. Securities Token Offering offers a tantalizing vision of democratized fundraising , global investor access, and greater company independence. While challenges remain, the potential benefits of STOs are undeniable. As regulations evolve and the crypto space matures, STOs could very well become a dominant force, empowering a new generation of small firms to innovate and grow on their own terms. The revolution in fundraising may indeed be tokenized, and it could be incredibly promising for the future of business.

Bitcoin World data indicates a bullish surge in Crude Oil price , specifically West Texas Intermediate (WTI). This positive movement in the energy sector can often reflect broader market optimism, a sentiment keenly followed by crypto investors. Let’s dive into what’s driving this upward trend in the Oil market and what it means for the wider economy. Why is the WTI Crude Oil Price Showing Bullish Momentum? According to the latest Bitcoin World data , West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude Oil price is currently trading at $72.24 per barrel. This marks an increase from Tuesday’s closing price of $71.74. Brent Crude is also experiencing gains, rising to $75.94 from $75.45. This bullish trend suggests growing confidence in the energy market . But what exactly is WTI Oil, and why should you care? Decoding WTI Oil: The Light and Sweet Benchmark WTI, or West Texas Intermediate, is a specific type of Crude Oil that plays a significant role in global energy markets. It’s considered a ‘light’ and ‘sweet’ crude due to its low density and sulfur content, making it easier and cheaper to refine into gasoline and other products. Sourced primarily in the United States and distributed through Cushing, Oklahoma – often called ‘The Pipeline Crossroads of the World’ – WTI serves as a crucial benchmark for Oil market pricing globally. Its price fluctuations are closely watched by investors, economists, and yes, even those in the cryptocurrency space, as energy prices can have ripple effects across various asset classes. Here’s a quick breakdown of WTI Oil’s key characteristics: Type: Light, sweet crude oil Origin: United States (West Texas Intermediate) Distribution Hub: Cushing, Oklahoma Benchmark: Major global Oil market benchmark Quality: High-quality, easy to refine What Factors Fuel the Price of WTI Crude Oil? Like any asset, the Crude Oil price is governed by the fundamental forces of supply and demand. Several factors can influence these forces in the energy market , leading to price volatility. Let’s explore some of the key drivers: Global Economic Growth: A strong global economy typically translates to increased demand for oil as industries ramp up production and transportation needs grow. Conversely, economic slowdowns can dampen demand and pressure Crude Oil price downwards. Geopolitical Events: Political instability, conflicts, and international sanctions in oil-producing regions can significantly disrupt supply chains, causing prices to spike. Events in the Middle East, for example, often have a direct and immediate impact on the Oil market . OPEC Decisions: The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies (OPEC+) play a crucial role in managing global oil supply. Their decisions on production quotas can significantly influence the Crude Oil price . Cuts in production tend to raise prices, while increases can lower them. US Dollar Strength: Since oil is predominantly traded in US dollars, the dollar’s value has an inverse relationship with Crude Oil price . A weaker dollar can make oil cheaper for buyers using other currencies, potentially increasing demand and pushing prices up, and vice versa. Inventory Levels: Weekly inventory reports provide insights into the balance between supply and demand in the US energy market , a major consumer and producer of oil. How Do Oil Inventory Reports Sway WTI Price? Keep an eye on those inventory numbers! The American Petroleum Institute (API) and the Energy Information Agency (EIA) release weekly reports that can act as catalysts for WTI price fluctuations. These reports detail changes in crude oil inventories, reflecting the current supply and demand dynamics in the energy market . Here’s how inventory data impacts Crude Oil price : Decreasing Inventories: A drop in oil inventories usually signals stronger demand than supply. This perceived scarcity can lead to upward pressure on WTI price , making it bullish. Increasing Inventories: Conversely, a rise in inventories suggests that supply is outpacing demand. This oversupply scenario can exert downward pressure on prices, making it bearish. While both API and EIA reports offer valuable insights, the EIA data is generally considered more authoritative due to its status as a government agency. Traders often compare both reports, as they tend to be closely aligned, reinforcing market sentiment regarding the direction of Crude Oil price . OPEC’s Influence: Can Production Quotas Dictate WTI Price? Absolutely! OPEC, a consortium of 12 major oil-producing nations, wields significant influence over the global Oil market , and consequently, the WTI price . Twice a year, OPEC convenes to decide on production quotas for its member countries. These decisions can have a profound impact on global oil supply and demand dynamics. OPEC’s strategies and their impact on Crude Oil price : Production Cuts: When OPEC decides to reduce production quotas, it effectively tightens global oil supply. This scarcity typically leads to an increase in Crude Oil price . Production Increases: Conversely, if OPEC opts to increase production quotas, it injects more supply into the market. This increased supply can lead to a decrease in Crude Oil price . The expanded group, OPEC+, which includes Russia and other non-OPEC nations, further amplifies this influence. Therefore, keeping track of OPEC+ meetings and announcements is crucial for anyone monitoring the energy market and predicting future movements in Crude Oil price . Conclusion: Navigating the Crude Oil Price Landscape The current bullish trend in Crude Oil price , as highlighted by Bitcoin World data , reflects a complex interplay of global economic factors, geopolitical dynamics, and supply-side management. Understanding these drivers is essential for anyone involved in trading or simply interested in the broader economic picture. While the short-term outlook for WTI price appears positive, the energy market remains inherently volatile, influenced by a multitude of unpredictable events. Staying informed and considering diverse sources of analysis, including data-driven insights, is key to navigating this dynamic landscape.

The precious metal is currently holding its breath near record highs, and all eyes are on the upcoming release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes. Will these minutes provide the fuel for the next surge in the gold price ? Let’s dive into what’s driving gold and what to expect. Gold Price Consolidation: Calm Before the Storm? After hitting all-time peaks last week, the gold price has entered a phase of consolidation. Think of it as a coiled spring, ready to unleash its energy in either direction. Currently hovering near its recent highs, gold is showing resilience, supported by ongoing concerns about global trade tensions and expectations of future interest rates cuts by the Federal Reserve. Several factors are contributing to this bullish backdrop: Safe-Haven Demand : Fears of a potential trade war, sparked by US President Trump’s tariff policies, are keeping investors on edge. In times of economic uncertainty, gold shines as a classic safe-haven asset , attracting investors seeking to protect their wealth. Dovish Fed Expectations : The market is increasingly betting on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates , possibly as early as September or October. Lower interest rates make gold more attractive compared to interest-bearing assets like bonds, further supporting the gold price . Weakening USD : Expectations of Fed rate cuts are putting pressure on the USD . A weaker dollar typically makes gold, priced in USD , cheaper for investors holding other currencies, thus boosting demand. FOMC Minutes: Decoding the Fed’s Next Move on Interest Rates The spotlight is firmly on the FOMC minutes . These minutes offer a detailed glimpse into the Federal Reserve’s discussions and considerations during their last meeting. Traders and investors are eagerly awaiting these minutes to glean insights into the Fed’s future path for interest rates . Why are the FOMC minutes so important? Aspect Importance for Gold Price Interest Rate Signals Clues about the timing and extent of future interest rates cuts are crucial. Dovish signals (indicating potential rate cuts) are generally positive for the gold price . Inflation Outlook The Fed’s view on inflation is critical. If the minutes suggest concerns about low inflation, it strengthens the case for rate cuts, potentially lifting the gold price . Economic Assessment The overall economic outlook presented in the minutes can influence market sentiment. A cautious or pessimistic outlook might increase safe-haven demand for gold. Vote Split The minutes reveal the level of consensus among FOMC members. A strong dovish leaning, even with some dissent, can still be interpreted as a positive signal for gold. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly’s recent comments highlight the delicate balancing act the Fed faces. She suggested holding steady on interest rates until there’s clearer progress towards the 2% inflation target. This underscores the market’s intense focus on the FOMC minutes for further direction. Technical Outlook: Is the Gold Price Poised for a Breakout? From a technical standpoint, the current consolidation in the gold price can be seen as a bullish continuation pattern. Despite the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hinting at overbought conditions, the overall setup favors further upside. Key Technical Levels to Watch: Resistance : The immediate hurdle remains the $2,940-$2,942 zone, the all-time high. A decisive break above this level could trigger a significant bullish move in the gold price . Support : On the downside, immediate support lies around $2,925, followed by $2,900 and the $2,878-$2,876 range. These levels are expected to cushion any corrective pullbacks. While some profit-taking might lead to temporary dips, the underlying bullish momentum suggests that buyers are likely to step in on any weakness. The path of least resistance for the gold price appears to be upward, especially if the FOMC minutes reinforce dovish expectations. Navigating the Gold Price : What’s Next? As we await the FOMC minutes , traders are in a holding pattern. The release is scheduled for today at 19:00 GMT and is expected to inject fresh volatility into the market. Key takeaways for gold traders: Monitor the USD : The USD ‘s reaction to the FOMC minutes will be crucial. A weaker USD is generally supportive of higher gold prices. Analyze the Tone : Pay close attention to the overall tone of the minutes. A dovish stance on interest rates is likely to be bullish for gold. Watch Technical Levels : Keep an eye on the key support and resistance levels mentioned earlier to anticipate potential breakouts or breakdowns in the gold price . Conclusion: Will FOMC Minutes Spark the Next Gold Rush? The gold price is delicately poised, awaiting a catalyst to determine its next major move. The FOMC minutes release is that potential catalyst. If the minutes reveal a Fed leaning towards further interest rates cuts, we could witness a powerful surge in the gold price , potentially pushing it into uncharted territory. Conversely, hawkish signals could trigger a temporary pullback. Buckle up, because volatility is on the horizon for gold!

While Bitcoin and Ethereum grab headlines, traditional currencies are making moves too. The Pound Sterling just delivered a powerful performance in the Forex market, surging after a surprisingly hot UK inflation report. Is this a fleeting spike or the start of a sustained rally? Let’s dive into the details and see what this means for the broader financial landscape. Why is the Pound Sterling Gaining Strength? Unpacking the UK Inflation Surge The primary driver behind the Pound Sterling’s recent gains is the release of the latest UK inflation data. January’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers came in hotter than anticipated, signaling persistent price pressures in the UK economy. Here’s a breakdown of the key figures: Headline CPI (Year-on-Year): Rose by 3%, exceeding the 2.8% forecast and December’s 2.5%. This indicates a significant acceleration in the overall inflation rate. Core CPI (Year-on-Year): Increased by 3.7%, matching expectations but still higher than the previous 3.2%. Core inflation strips out volatile components, suggesting underlying inflationary pressures are robust. Headline CPI (Month-on-Month): Deflated by 0.1%, less than the expected 0.3% deflation. This points to sticky inflation even on a monthly basis. Services Sector Inflation: A closely watched metric by the Bank of England (BoE), jumped to 5% from 4.4% in December. This is particularly concerning as services inflation tends to be more persistent. These figures paint a picture of an economy where inflation is proving more stubborn than anticipated. For Forex traders, this immediately translates to potential action from the Bank of England, which in turn impacts the value of the Pound Sterling. Bank of England’s Balancing Act: Inflation vs. Economic Slowdown The Bank of England (BoE) finds itself in a tricky situation. While the latest UK Inflation report is concerning, the central bank has previously indicated that it expects short-term inflation upticks due to energy price fluctuations. Governor Andrew Bailey recently stated that he doesn’t believe the inflation increase will be “persistent” and anticipates a “gradual disinflation” trend to continue. He also highlighted the “sluggish state” of the UK economy, which could naturally act as a brake on inflation. However, hotter-than-expected inflation data limits the BoE’s room for maneuver. Further monetary easing, such as interest rate cuts, becomes less likely in the face of rising prices. This anticipation of a less dovish BoE is a key factor supporting the Pound Sterling’s strength in the Forex market. Trump’s Tariff Threats: A Wildcard in the Forex Arena Adding another layer of complexity to the Forex News landscape is the return of trade war anxieties. Former US President Trump has threatened to impose substantial 25% tariffs on imports of automobiles, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals. This move has the potential to: Strengthen the US Dollar: Tariffs can be seen as inflationary in the US, potentially leading to a more hawkish Federal Reserve and a stronger dollar. Slow Global Economic Growth: Trade wars disrupt global supply chains and dampen economic activity, creating uncertainty in financial markets. Impact Currency Valuations: Changes in trade dynamics can shift currency valuations as investors react to evolving economic and political landscapes. While the immediate focus is on the UK Inflation and its impact on the Pound Sterling, Trump’s tariff threats are a significant risk factor that could influence broader Forex market sentiment and potentially impact GBP/USD and other currency pairs. GBP/USD Technical Outlook: Riding the Bullish Wave From a technical analysis perspective, the Pound Sterling appears to be gaining momentum against the US Dollar (GBP/USD). Here are some key technical points: Breaching Resistance: GBP/USD has broken above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, coinciding with the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) around 1.2620. This suggests a shift in momentum towards the upside. RSI Momentum: The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is above 60.00, indicating growing bullish momentum. Sustaining above this level would further reinforce the upward trend. Support and Resistance Levels: Key support lies at the February 3 low of 1.2250. On the upside, the 50% Fibonacci retracement at 1.2767 represents a significant resistance level. The technical picture suggests that the Pound Sterling could continue its upward trajectory against the US Dollar, at least in the short term, as long as the bullish momentum persists and key resistance levels are overcome. Understanding the Pound Sterling: A Quick Forex Primer For those new to Forex News and currency trading, here’s a quick overview of the Pound Sterling (GBP): Aspect Details Official Currency of United Kingdom Currency Code GBP Nickname (GBP/USD) Cable Nickname (GBP/JPY) Dragon Issued by Bank of England (BoE) Global Ranking (FX Trading) 4th most traded currency The value of the Pound Sterling is heavily influenced by the Bank of England’s monetary policy decisions, particularly interest rate adjustments. Economic data releases, such as GDP, PMIs, employment figures, and the Trade Balance, also play a crucial role in shaping GBP’s value in the Forex market. A strong UK economy and hawkish BoE policies generally support a stronger Pound Sterling. In Conclusion: Pound Sterling’s Rally – A Sign of Things to Come? The Pound Sterling’s surge following the hot UK Inflation report is a significant event in the Forex market . It highlights the ongoing battle against inflation faced by central banks globally and the immediate currency reactions to economic data. While the Bank of England remains cautiously optimistic about long-term disinflation, the near-term reality of sticky inflation is providing a boost to the Pound. Keep a close eye on upcoming UK Retail Sales and PMI data, as well as any further pronouncements from the Bank of England, to gauge the sustainability of this Pound Sterling rally. And remember, global events like potential trade wars can always inject volatility into the Forex arena.

Recent analysis from ING suggests a broad weakening of the EUR, particularly against the US Dollar. This alarming trend is attributed to a mix of factors, from geopolitical uncertainties to shifting global economic policies. Let’s delve into the details and understand what this means for the forex market and potentially, your investments. Why is the Euro (EUR) Under Pressure? According to ING’s FX analysts, the recent rise in the German ZEW index, initially seen as a positive sign, might be misleading. Francesco Pesole from ING points out that this optimism may stem from anticipation of a government change rather than a genuine improvement in growth sentiment. This underlying fragility in sentiment is a key factor contributing to the currency weakening of the Euro. Here’s a breakdown of the factors driving the EUR downwards: Geopolitical Tensions: The ongoing Russia-US talks are heavily influencing the Euro’s trajectory. Any hint of escalation or prolonged uncertainty tends to weigh negatively on European currencies. Trump Factor: The potential for a more transactional approach from the US towards European NATO allies, especially under a Trump administration, is introducing a significant risk premium. This perceived threat is exacerbating the Euro’s vulnerability. Fair Value Model: ING’s short-term fair value model indicates that EUR/USD currently shows zero risk premium. This essentially means the pair is not undervalued, leaving it susceptible to further downside pressure, especially if US protectionism risks are repriced into the FX market. EUR/USD : How Low Can It Go? The million-dollar question for traders and investors alike is: how far can this currency weakening push the EUR/USD pair? ING analysts suggest a potential correction down to 1.040 this week. This projection is based on the anticipation of increased market sensitivity to US protectionist policies and the broader geopolitical landscape. Consider these points regarding the EUR/USD outlook: Downside Risks: The absence of a risk premium in the current EUR/USD valuation signals that the path of least resistance might be downwards. 1.040 Target: ING’s target of 1.040 is not just a random number; it represents a level where the market might re-evaluate the balance of risks and potentially find a temporary bottom. Volatility Ahead: Expect increased volatility in the EUR/USD pair as markets react to news flow concerning US policy and geopolitical developments. What Does This Mean for You? Understanding the drivers behind the Euro’s weakness is crucial for anyone involved in forex trading or international finance. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on geopolitical news, especially updates on Russia-US relations and any signals regarding US trade policy. Risk Management: Given the potential for further downside in EUR/USD , prudent risk management is essential. Consider adjusting your positions and using stop-loss orders to protect your capital. Diversification: If you hold significant Euro-denominated assets, consider diversification strategies to mitigate the impact of potential further currency weakening . Is This the End for the Euro? While the current outlook for the Euro appears bearish, it’s important to remember that currency markets are dynamic and influenced by a multitude of factors. The currency weakening trend highlighted by ING is a significant warning sign, but not necessarily a prediction of a complete collapse. Market sentiment can shift rapidly, and economic data releases, central bank policies, and unexpected global events can all play a role in altering the Euro’s course. Key Takeaways: ING analysts foresee continued weakness in the EUR across the board. Geopolitical risks and potential US protectionism are major contributing factors. EUR/USD could potentially decline to 1.040 in the near term. Traders should exercise caution and stay informed about market developments. In conclusion, the Euro’s current predicament warrants close attention. While the situation is fluid, the analysis from ING provides valuable insights into the potential downside risks and key factors influencing the currency weakening . Staying informed and adapting your strategies will be crucial in navigating these uncertain times in the forex market.

40568509,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131163,1740023175,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Unfazed GBP: UK Inflation Rebound Not Concerning, Says ING",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/unfazed-gbp-uk-inflation-ing/,"Cryptocurrency markets are closely watching traditional financial indicators for signals that could influence broader market sentiment. Today’s UK inflation data release and ING’s analysis offer valuable insights into the resilience of the British Pound (GBP) and potential future monetary policy, which can indirectly impact crypto investment strategies. Decoding the UK Inflation Data: Is the Rebound a Concern? This morning’s release of January’s UK inflation data initially caused a stir, but leading financial institution ING suggests there’s no cause for alarm. The headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) saw an acceleration to 3.0%, slightly exceeding forecasts. However, ING’s FX analysts, led by Francesco Pesole, point out that this uptick is largely attributed to an unexpected surge in food prices. Crucially, markets appear to be echoing this sentiment, with minimal reaction in the pound’s value. Let’s break down the key components of the inflation data: Headline CPI: Increased to 3.0%, slightly above the predicted 2.8-2.9%. Food Prices: The primary driver of the unexpected inflation increase in January. Services Inflation: Came in marginally lower than anticipated at 5.0%. Core Services Inflation (Excluding Volatile Items & Rents): Showed a positive trend, decreasing to 4.2% from 4.7% over the past two months. The seemingly concerning headline figure is being offset by more nuanced data points, particularly the encouraging trend in core services inflation. This suggests that underlying inflationary pressures might be easing, despite the headline GBP Inflation number. ING Analysis: Why the Inflation Rebound is Deemed ‘Not Concerning’ ING’s assessment hinges on the details beneath the surface of the UK inflation data . They highlight two critical factors that lead them to believe the rebound is not a significant threat: One-Off Factors: The surge in food prices is considered an isolated incident rather than a systemic inflationary pressure. Benign Core Services Inflation: The steady improvement in core services inflation, as measured by ING, indicates a more controlled inflationary environment than the headline figure suggests. Furthermore, ING clarifies the service inflation figures, noting that December’s data was artificially suppressed due to measurement issues with Christmas airfares. Adjusting for this, the underlying trend in services inflation is less alarming than initially perceived. Rate Cut Forecasts Maintained: What This Means for GBP Perhaps the most significant takeaway from ING’s analysis is their continued projection of rate cut forecasts . Despite the inflation uptick, they maintain their expectation of one rate cut per quarter throughout the year. This conviction is underpinned by their belief that the benign trend in services inflation will persist into the second quarter. For GBP, this implies a potentially less hawkish stance from the Bank of England than some might have anticipated based solely on the headline inflation number. If ING’s forecasts prove accurate, it could limit upside potential for the pound in the medium term. EUR/GBP Outlook: Eyes on the 0.820 Level ING’s analysis extends to the EUR/GBP pair, noting a recent break below the 0.8300 level. They attribute the euro’s underperformance to “idiosyncratic” factors, potentially linked to the EU’s geopolitical positioning relative to the US. While cautious about calling a bottom for the pair, ING suggests a move towards 0.820 is “not out of scope.” In the longer term, ING believes that the GBP curve is due for dovish repricing, which should eventually offer some support to EUR/GBP. However, in the short term, the euro’s weakness may persist. Actionable Insights for Crypto and Forex Traders While this analysis focuses on traditional Forex markets, there are crucial takeaways for cryptocurrency traders and investors: Monitor Global Macro Trends: Inflation data and central bank reactions in major economies like the UK can indirectly influence global market sentiment, including crypto markets. Diversification and Risk Management: Understanding Forex market dynamics can inform diversification strategies and risk management approaches in crypto portfolios. Stay Informed on Economic Analysis: Institutions like ING provide valuable macroeconomic insights. Keeping abreast of such analyses can enhance your understanding of broader market forces. EUR/GBP as a Sentiment Indicator: Movements in currency pairs like EUR/GBP can sometimes reflect broader risk appetite and geopolitical sentiment, which can have spillover effects into crypto markets. Conclusion: Steady as She Goes for GBP? ING’s calm assessment of the latest UK inflation data suggests a steady outlook for the GBP, despite the headline rebound. Their analysis emphasizes the importance of looking beyond surface-level numbers and understanding the underlying trends. For traders in both traditional and cryptocurrency markets, this report serves as a reminder that nuanced economic analysis is crucial for informed decision-making, and knee-jerk reactions to headline figures can be misleading.

He opened up about the strong recovery of America’s economy since his election, citing significant improvements since November 5th. The Nasdaq has risen nearly 10%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 2,200 points, and Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs. Trump expressed his goal of making America the leading hub for cryptocurrency, aiming to keep the country at the forefront of the industry. “Bitcoin set multiple all-time record highs because everyone knows that I’m committed to making America the crypto capital,” he said. He added, “We want to stay at the forefront of everything, and one of them is crypto, and Miami seems to be the center of the action, come to think of it, and maybe it’ll stay there.” Criticism of the SEC and Its Stance on Crypto Trump also took the opportunity to criticize the SEC under the Biden administration, particularly former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who left the agency last month. Trump stated, “We ended that war totally,” referring to the SEC’s stance on crypto. He added that the SEC had been hostile toward the industry until the very end, but with so many people invested in Bitcoin and crypto, they changed their tone, becoming “very nice” just before Gensler’s departure. Before and since taking office, Trump has shown strong support for digital assets. He appointed crypto-friendly former regulator Paul Atkins to lead the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Trump’s recent remarks come amid various developments in the crypto world, including Elon Musk-led DOGE’s investigation against the SEC. Additionally, the SEC has paused its ongoing cases against major cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Coinbase.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|EXCHANGE|DOGE|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-20 03:47:28

A recent community vote on Binance Square, Binance Exchange’s social platform, showcased an impressive 86.2% support for the potential listing. This significant show of community enthusiasm raises crucial questions about the future of Pi Network and Binance’s listing decisions. Let’s dive into the details of this exciting development and explore what it could mean for the crypto landscape. Decoding the Binance Community Vote on Pi Network Listing Binance Square recently hosted a community vote to gauge user sentiment regarding the potential listing of Pi Network’s PI token. The vote, which commenced on February 17th, saw an impressive turnout, with 69,706 users participating as of February 17th at 23:59 (UTC). The results are compelling: Participation: A substantial 69,706 Binance users cast their votes. Overwhelming Support: A striking 86.2% of voters expressed their support for listing Pi Network (PI). Vote Duration: The vote remains open until February 27th, 23:59 (UTC), suggesting the final support percentage could potentially shift, although a major change from 86.2% seems unlikely. Platform: The vote was conducted on Binance Square, highlighting Binance’s engagement with its community through its social platform. This data clearly indicates a strong desire within the Binance community to see PI listed on the exchange. The sheer volume of votes and the overwhelming percentage in favor underscores the community’s interest in Pi Network. But what exactly does this vote mean in the grand scheme of crypto listings? Why is this Community Vote for Crypto Listing Significant? Community votes, especially on major platforms like Binance Square, carry significant weight in the cryptocurrency world. They serve as a direct channel for users to express their preferences and influence exchange decisions. Here’s why this vote for a Pi Network crypto listing is noteworthy: Community Sentiment Indicator: The vote provides Binance with invaluable insight into the community’s appetite for PI. An 86.2% approval rating is a powerful signal of user interest and potential trading volume. Demand Validation: It validates the demand for Pi Network within the Binance ecosystem. This can be a crucial factor for Binance when considering new listings, as exchanges prioritize assets that are likely to attract users and trading activity. Decentralized Influence: Community votes exemplify the decentralized ethos of crypto, where users have a voice and can potentially influence the direction of major platforms. Marketing and Awareness: The vote itself generates buzz and awareness around Pi Network and its potential listing on Binance. This increased visibility can benefit both Pi Network and Binance. However, it’s crucial to understand the limitations and context of this vote. Binance has explicitly stated that the vote results are for reference only and do not guarantee a listing. This brings us to the next important question. Does a High Vote Percentage Guarantee a Pi Network Crypto Exchange Listing on Binance? While the 86.2% support is undeniably impressive, it’s essential to manage expectations. Binance’s official announcement clearly states that the vote is for “reference only.” This means several factors come into play when Binance makes a listing decision, and community vote is just one of them. Let’s consider the factors Binance likely weighs: Factor Description Relevance to Pi Network Listing Project Fundamentals Binance thoroughly assesses the project’s technology, whitepaper, team, roadmap, and overall viability. Binance will scrutinize Pi Network’s technology, its consensus mechanism, utility, and long-term vision. Tokenomics Token distribution, supply, demand, and economic model are crucial for a healthy market. Pi Network’s tokenomics, including its mining and distribution model, will be under review. Compliance and Legal Regulatory compliance and legal aspects are paramount for Binance to avoid risks. Binance will assess Pi Network’s compliance with global and regional regulations. Security The security of the network and smart contracts is vital to protect user funds. Binance will evaluate Pi Network’s security infrastructure and protocols. Community and Adoption (Already Demonstrated) A strong and active community indicates user interest and potential for growth. The community vote already highlights strong community support for Pi Network. Trading Volume Potential Exchanges benefit from high trading volumes, generating fees and liquidity. Binance will analyze the potential trading volume of PI, considering the community interest. As you can see, while community support is a positive signal, Binance’s decision-making process is multifaceted and rigorous. A high vote percentage certainly strengthens Pi Network’s case, but it’s not the sole determinant. What is Pi Network and Why the Excitement for a Crypto Exchange Listing? For those unfamiliar, Pi Network is a cryptocurrency project designed to be mined on mobile phones. It aims to make crypto mining accessible to everyone, moving away from the energy-intensive models of traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The excitement surrounding a potential crypto exchange listing stems from several factors: Mainstream Accessibility: Pi Network aims to bring cryptocurrency to a broader audience through mobile mining, making it more user-friendly and accessible than some other cryptocurrencies. Large User Base: Pi Network boasts a significant user base, often referred to as “Pioneers,” who have been mining PI through the mobile app. A listing would provide these users with a way to potentially trade and realize value from their mined PI. Ecosystem Development: A listing on a major exchange like Binance could accelerate the development of the Pi Network ecosystem, attracting developers, partnerships, and further adoption. Price Discovery: Currently, PI is not traded on major exchanges. A listing would enable price discovery, allowing the market to determine the value of PI. However, Pi Network has also faced scrutiny and discussions within the crypto community regarding its network structure, token distribution, and the fact that the mined PI is not yet tradable. A Binance listing would be a significant step towards addressing some of these concerns and validating the project in the eyes of many. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Pi Network and Binance? The Binance community vote has undoubtedly put Pi Network in the spotlight. While we await Binance’s final decision, here’s what we can expect and consider: Continued Community Engagement: The Pi Network community is likely to remain highly engaged, hoping for a positive listing decision from Binance. Binance’s Deliberation: Binance will now carefully consider the vote results alongside its own due diligence process, evaluating all the factors mentioned earlier. Market Speculation: The crypto market will likely see increased speculation and discussion around Pi Network’s potential Binance listing. Potential Listing (or Not): Ultimately, Binance will announce its decision. A listing would be a major win for Pi Network and its community, while a non-listing would necessitate further development and community building for Pi Network to pursue future exchange opportunities. In conclusion, the Binance community vote emphatically demonstrates a strong desire for Pi Network’s PI token to be listed on the exchange. This surge in community demand is a powerful signal, but it’s just one piece of the puzzle in Binance’s listing evaluation process. The crypto world watches with bated breath to see if this overwhelming community support will translate into a Binance listing for Pi Network, marking a potentially exciting chapter for both projects.

40568539,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131172,1740023336,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Pound Sterling Surges: Hot UK Inflation Data Ignites Forex Market Optimism,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/pound-sterling-uk-inflation-surge/,"In a surprising turn of events, the Pound Sterling has experienced a noticeable uplift in the Forex market. This jolt comes directly after the release of unexpectedly high UK inflation data, injecting a fresh wave of volatility and opportunity into currency trading. Are you ready to dive into the details of how UK inflation is currently shaping the Pound’s trajectory and what it means for your trades? UK Inflation Data Sparks Pound Sterling Gains The Pound Sterling is currently enjoying renewed interest from investors, spurred by the latest UK inflation report for January. The data revealed a hotter-than-anticipated rise in consumer prices, exceeding forecasts and shaking up market expectations. Let’s break down the key figures: Headline CPI Soars: The headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) jumped to 3% year-on-year, surpassing both the anticipated 2.8% and the previous month’s 2.5%. This unexpected surge signals stronger inflationary pressures within the UK economy. Core CPI Meets Expectations: The core CPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy, aligned with expectations at 3.7% year-on-year, slightly up from the previous 3.2%. While expected, this figure still points to persistent underlying inflation. Month-on-Month Deflation Slows: Monthly headline CPI deflation was a slower 0.1% compared to the 0.3% in December, and against economists’ expectations of 0.3% deflation. This suggests that the cooling of inflation is not happening as rapidly as anticipated. Services Sector Inflation Accelerates: A critical metric for the Bank of England (BoE), inflation in the services sector, climbed to 5% from 4.4% in December. This acceleration is particularly concerning for the BoE as it reflects domestically generated price pressures. This hotter-than-expected inflation data has led to immediate reactions in the Forex market , with the Pound Sterling gaining ground against several major currencies. The table below illustrates the Pound’s performance against its peers: Currency USD EUR GBP JPY CAD AUD NZD CHF USD 0.07% -0.08% -0.23% 0.03% -0.13% -0.45% 0.16% EUR -0.07% -0.15% -0.29% -0.04% -0.20% -0.50% 0.09% GBP 0.08% 0.15% -0.15% 0.12% -0.05% -0.35% 0.24% JPY 0.23% 0.29% 0.15% 0.24% 0.07% -0.25% 0.36% CAD -0.03% 0.04% -0.12% -0.24% -0.17% -0.47% 0.12% AUD 0.13% 0.20% 0.05% -0.07% 0.17% -0.30% 0.29% NZD 0.45% 0.50% 0.35% 0.25% 0.47% 0.30% 0.60% CHF -0.16% -0.09% -0.24% -0.36% -0.12% -0.29% -0.60% Table: British Pound (GBP) percentage change against major currencies. BoE’s Stance Amidst Rising UK Inflation Despite the concerning inflation figures, the Bank of England (BoE) maintains a somewhat dovish outlook. BoE Governor Andrew Bailey has previously indicated that while inflation might see a temporary increase due to energy price fluctuations, he believes this uptick will not be persistent. He continues to foresee a “gradual disinflation going on” and emphasizes the “sluggish state” of the UK economy as a factor that will naturally counteract inflationary pressures. However, the recent inflation data could present a challenge to the BoE’s forward guidance. Key considerations for traders and investors include: Limited Monetary Easing: The rise in UK inflation might restrict the BoE’s capacity for further monetary easing. Markets will be keenly watching for any shift in the BoE’s rhetoric. Data Dependency: Future monetary policy decisions will heavily rely on upcoming economic data. Keep an eye on the UK Retail Sales for January and the preliminary S&P Global/CIPS Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for February, due Friday. Global Economic Factors: External factors, such as potential tariff implementations by the US, could also influence the UK’s economic outlook and, consequently, the BoE’s policy decisions. GBP/USD Technical Outlook: Holding Key Levels From a technical analysis perspective, the GBP/USD pair is navigating crucial levels. Currently trading above 1.2600, the pair is testing resistance around the 1.2620 mark, coinciding with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement and the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Key technical points to watch: Support: The February 3 low of 1.2250 remains a significant support level. Resistance: The 50% Fibonacci retracement at 1.2767 presents a key resistance zone on the upside. RSI Momentum: The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is above 60.00, suggesting building bullish momentum. Sustaining above this level could signal further upward potential for the GBP/USD. Trump’s Tariff Threats: A Wildcard in the Forex Market Adding another layer of complexity to the Forex market landscape are renewed tariff threats from former US President Donald Trump. His recent statements about imposing a 25% tariff on automobiles, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals have reintroduced trade war anxieties. This development could have several implications: USD Strength: Historically, tariff threats have sometimes led to a strengthening of the US Dollar as investors seek safe-haven assets. Global Economic Slowdown: Widespread tariffs could trigger a slowdown in global trade and economic growth, impacting various currencies, including the Pound Sterling. Market Volatility: Such geopolitical uncertainties tend to increase volatility across financial markets, presenting both risks and opportunities for traders. Navigating the Pound Sterling and UK Inflation Landscape The latest UK inflation data has undeniably injected a dose of excitement into the Pound Sterling and the broader Forex market . While the immediate reaction has been positive for the Pound, the sustainability of these gains hinges on a multitude of factors, including the BoE’s future policy moves, upcoming economic data, and global economic developments. For traders, staying informed, adapting to evolving market conditions, and employing robust risk management strategies will be paramount in navigating this dynamic environment.

The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, and with it comes innovative ways to participate in this burgeoning market. If you’ve been looking for a regulated and accessible route to gain exposure to a diverse basket of cryptocurrencies, then you need to pay attention. Leading asset manager WisdomTree has just dropped a game-changer at Consensus Hong Kong 2025 – the WisdomTree Physical CoinDesk 20 ETP (WCRP). Let’s dive into what this means for you and the future of crypto investment. What is the Buzz About the WisdomTree ETP? Think of Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) as similar to ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds). They are investment vehicles that track the performance of an underlying index, sector, or asset class and trade on stock exchanges just like stocks. WisdomTree, a well-established asset manager, is bringing this familiar concept to the crypto world with its new WisdomTree ETP . But this isn’t just any crypto ETP; it’s linked to the CoinDesk 20 Index, a benchmark index representing a significant portion of the digital asset market. Imagine having a single investment that gives you exposure to a range of top cryptocurrencies, much like how an S&P 500 ETF gives you exposure to the top 500 US companies. That’s essentially what the WCRP aims to achieve for the digital asset space. Decoding the CoinDesk 20 Index: Your Gateway to the Crypto Market The heart of the WCRP lies in the CoinDesk 20 Index . But what exactly is this index, and why is it significant? Broad Market Representation: The CoinDesk 20 Index is designed to measure the performance of the largest and most liquid digital assets. It’s not just about Bitcoin; it encompasses a diverse selection of cryptocurrencies that meet specific eligibility criteria. Rigorous Selection Process: CoinDesk Indices employs a rules-based methodology to construct and maintain the CoinDesk 20. This means the index isn’t arbitrarily put together; it follows clear, transparent rules for inclusion and exclusion of digital assets. Market Capitalization Weighted: Similar to many traditional market indices, the CoinDesk 20 is market capitalization-weighted. This means that cryptocurrencies with larger market caps have a greater influence on the index’s performance. Regular Review and Rebalancing: To ensure the index remains relevant and accurately reflects the market, CoinDesk 20 is periodically reviewed and rebalanced. This keeps the index aligned with the evolving digital asset landscape. By tracking the CoinDesk 20 Index, the WisdomTree Physical CoinDesk 20 ETP provides investors with a snapshot of the broader crypto market’s performance, beyond just individual coins. Why Choose a Crypto ETP for Digital Asset Investment? Investing in cryptocurrencies can seem daunting. Directly buying and managing digital assets involves navigating exchanges, wallets, and security concerns. This is where crypto ETP products like WCRP come into play, offering several potential advantages: Benefit Description Accessibility ETPs trade on regulated stock exchanges, making them easily accessible to a wide range of investors through their existing brokerage accounts. No need to set up crypto wallets or learn complex exchange interfaces. Regulation and Security ETPs operate within established regulatory frameworks, offering a level of investor protection not always present in the direct crypto market. They are also custodied by regulated financial institutions, reducing security risks associated with self-custody of digital assets. Diversification The WCRP, linked to the CoinDesk 20 Index, inherently provides diversification across a basket of leading digital assets. This can help mitigate the risk associated with investing in single cryptocurrencies. Familiar Investment Structure For investors already familiar with traditional ETPs or ETFs, crypto ETPs offer a comfortable and understandable investment structure. It bridges the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world. However, it’s crucial to remember that while ETPs offer advantages, they are still investments and come with risks. The value of digital assets can be highly volatile, and investors should be prepared for potential fluctuations in the value of their digital asset investment . ETP Launch: Expanding Access to Crypto Across Europe The ETP launch of WisdomTree Physical CoinDesk 20 (WCRP) is significant not just for the product itself, but also for its accessibility. WisdomTree has strategically listed the WCRP on major European exchanges: Deutsche Börse Xetra (Germany) Swiss Stock Exchange SIX (Switzerland) Euronext Paris (France) Euronext Amsterdam (Netherlands) This broad listing across key European markets signifies a growing appetite for regulated crypto investment products and makes WCRP readily available to a large investor base in Europe. It also highlights the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets as a legitimate asset class. Navigating Digital Asset Investment with WisdomTree ETP: Is it for You? So, who might find the WisdomTree Physical CoinDesk 20 ETP appealing? Investors Seeking Diversified Crypto Exposure: If you want to invest in crypto but are hesitant to pick individual coins, WCRP offers a diversified approach through the CoinDesk 20 Index. Traditional Investors Entering Crypto: For those familiar with stock market investing and ETPs, this product provides a comfortable and regulated entry point into the digital asset space. Long-Term Crypto Believers: If you have a long-term bullish outlook on the crypto market, WCRP allows you to participate in the potential growth of the broader digital asset ecosystem without the complexities of direct crypto ownership. Actionable Insights: Do Your Research: Understand the CoinDesk 20 Index, the methodology behind it, and the risks associated with digital asset investment before investing in WCRP. Consider Your Risk Tolerance: Crypto investments are inherently volatile. Assess your risk appetite and ensure WCRP aligns with your overall investment strategy. Consult a Financial Advisor: If you’re unsure whether WCRP is right for you, seek advice from a qualified financial advisor who can assess your individual financial situation and investment goals. Conclusion: A Smart Step Towards Mainstream Crypto Investment WisdomTree’s launch of the Physical CoinDesk 20 ETP (WCRP) is a significant step forward in making digital asset investment more accessible and regulated. By linking to the well-regarded CoinDesk 20 Index and listing on major European exchanges, WisdomTree is providing a smart and familiar route for investors to tap into the potential of the crypto market. As the digital asset landscape continues to mature, products like WCRP are likely to play a crucial role in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the exciting world of cryptocurrencies.

While the crypto market is filled with thousands of options, only a select few have the potential to achieve exponential growth. Projects that combine real-world use cases, community engagement, and technological advancements stand the best chance of skyrocketing in value. In this guide, we explore the top crypto coins for 1000x ROI, starting with Web3Bay, which is revolutionizing online shopping security with blockchain technology. 1. Web3Bay (WBAY) – Blockchain-Powered Online Shopping Solution Online shopping faces significant issues, including scams, fake reviews, and chargeback fraud, making both buyers and sellers vulnerable. Web3Bay addresses these challenges with its blockchain-based escrow system, ensuring transactions are transparent, secure, and dispute-free. Payments are held in escrow until all conditions are met, eliminating fraudulent listings and chargeback fraud. For small business owners, this system minimizes losses from false claims and disputes, while shoppers gain confidence by purchasing from verified sellers. Additionally, blockchain immutability prevents fake reviews, ensuring trustworthy product ratings. This shift from traditional e-commerce creates a safer and more reliable marketplace. Web3Bay’s presale is gaining momentum, having raised $1.4 million in stage 4 at a batch price of $0.004562625. With over 300 billion coins sold, demand continues to grow as users recognize the need for secure digital transactions. Given its potential to redefine online shopping security, Web3Bay stands out as a prime candidate for massive gains and 1000x ROI potential. 2. Filecoin (FIL) – Decentralized Storage Powerhouse As Web3 adoption accelerates, decentralized storage solutions are becoming essential. Filecoin leads this sector by offering a distributed data storage network that enhances security and accessibility. Unlike centralized cloud storage providers, Filecoin ensures users retain control over their data while incentivizing storage providers. With major tech companies exploring blockchain solutions, Filecoin’s demand is expected to rise. If institutional adoption increases, FIL’s value could skyrocket, making it a strong contender for exponential growth and a possible 1000x ROI in the long run. 3. Dogecoin (DOGE) – Potential ETF Catalyst & Musk’s Endorsement Dogecoin remains one of the most well-known meme coins, but its influence extends beyond internet culture. With speculation around a potential DOGE ETF and continuous backing from Elon Musk, Dogecoin could see a resurgence in value. Musk’s integration of Dogecoin into Tesla’s payment system and potential future use in X (formerly Twitter) adds to its utility. If mainstream adoption gains traction, DOGE could defy expectations and deliver substantial gains, possibly reaching 1000x ROI for early investors. 4. Bonk (BONK) – Solana’s Meme Coin with Strong Community Bonk has emerged as a leading meme coin within the Solana ecosystem, benefiting from low transaction fees and high-speed transfers. Unlike many speculative tokens, Bonk’s developers are actively integrating real-world utility, such as DeFi applications and NFT projects. With an engaged community and expanding use cases, Bonk has the potential to replicate past meme coin rallies, offering early investors significant upside if momentum continues. If the right catalysts align, BONK could be among the few tokens with 1000x ROI potential. 5. Floki (FLOKI) – Expanding DeFi & NFT Ecosystem Floki is positioning itself as more than just a meme coin, focusing on DeFi, NFTs, and metaverse applications. Its developers are pushing for widespread adoption through strategic partnerships and community-driven initiatives. Floki’s recent integrations with various DeFi platforms and NFT marketplaces signal long-term potential. If adoption accelerates, Floki could become one of the biggest meme coins to deliver outsized gains and potentially offer 1000x ROI to those who invest early. Summing Up Investing in crypto carries risk, but selecting coins with strong fundamentals and growing adoption increases the likelihood of high returns. Web3Bay leads this list due to its real-world utility in securing online transactions, followed by established projects like Filecoin, Dogecoin, Bonk, and Floki. As the crypto market evolves, these projects have the potential to generate substantial returns for investors seeking 1000x ROI opportunities.

Do it, and you’ll go to prison.” The Coinbase CEO made the statement on X (formerly Twitter) today, addressing the meme coin frenzy that has taken over the market. Brian said he isn’t against meme coins, but he’s calling out those taking it too far—trading on inside information, rigging launches, and scamming retail investors. His warning comes after Hayden Davis, the self-proclaimed “launch strategist” behind multiple political meme coins, admitted to market manipulation, insider trading, and sniper wallets in an interview with Coffeezilla on Saturday. Hayden launched $LIBRA, the Argentinian meme token that wiped $4.6 billion from the market in hours. “This is an insiders’ game. It’s an unregulated casino,” Hayden said. He detailed how the elites get in early, manipulating prices before dumping on retail investors. He even admitted that some insiders received access to Trump’s token at a private dinner in Washington, D.C., before the public launch. Hayden seemed almost indifferent to the damage. “I thought some of these meme coins could turn into something real,” he said. “But the reality is, it’s just a game. The people who know how to play win. The rest lose.” Brian says meme coins still deserve their flowers Brian addressed the meme coin explosion, acknowledging that while some tokens are “silly, offensive, or even fraudulent”, they’re an inevitable part of crypto’s evolution. “Meme coins have been with us since the beginning – Dogecoin is still one of the most popular coins. Even Bitcoin is somewhat of a memecoin (one could argue so is the U.S. dollar, once it was disconnected from gold),” Brian said. He compared meme coins to the early internet, where pointless animated GIFs eventually became part of something much bigger. “New technologies often look like a toy but evolve into something much more powerful over time,” wrote Brian. Coinbase, he said, believes in free market capitalism. If a token is legal and customers want to trade it, they should be allowed to make that choice. But he made one thing clear: “Some meme coins have clearly gone too far lately, to the extent people are insider trading. This is illegal, and people should understand that you will go to prison for this.” Brian added that: “Don’t break the law! And don’t try to get rich quick. You should get rich by contributing real lasting value to society (or at least be trying – it’s not easy!).” Cryptopolitan Academy: Are You Making These Web3 Resume Mistakes? - Find Out Here",News|Coinbase,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-20 04:00:16

While established cryptocurrencies often capture headlines, seasoned analysts argue that lesser-known projects can deliver exponential returns. One expert has singled out PCHAIN as a hidden gem, going so far as to label it the best altcoin for those aiming to achieve million-dollar portfolios by 2025. This altcoin stands out by blending real-world applications with significant upside potential, pushing it to the forefront of altcoins set to disrupt traditional markets. The Growing Appetite for the Best Altcoin to Become a Millionaire As the digital asset space evolves, savvy traders are moving beyond the usual suspects in hopes of finding the best altcoin to eclipse mainstream coins in terms of profitability. Prices of major tokens often follow predictable patterns, causing some investors to miss out on extreme growth. According to this expert’s report, PCHAIN is the best altcoin to deliver game-changing results thanks to its innovative approach to real estate, AI, and metaverse functionalities. In the quest for the best altcoin to become a millionaire, many are switching focus to ecosystems like PCHAIN, which has already raised over $2 million in its presale. The token sells at $0.011 in round two, set to climb to $0.023 in the third round. The eventual listing at $0.032 promises an 800% return for early adopters, an enticing proposition for those eyeing the best altcoin in the current market. Blockchain-based real estate solutions make PCHAIN particularly appealing. Traditional property investment often carries high entry barriers, leaving countless would-be investors locked out. By tokenizing ownership, this altcoin bridges crypto innovation and tangible assets, a model that could transform entire industries. The expert’s assessment suggests that if PCHAIN maintains development momentum and garners further public attention, it stands a strong chance of securing its place among the best altcoins by 2025. Why PCHAIN’s Real Estate Innovation Positions It as the Best Altcoin PCHAIN sets itself apart by reshaping how we perceive real-world asset investing, chiefly real estate. The project employs fractional ownership and tokenization to let people acquire portions of high-value holdings with minimal upfront capital. Rather than spending millions to purchase farmland or office buildings, participants can buy smaller shares through PCHAIN tokens. For instance, a $10 million farmland can be divided into 10,000 tokens, priced at $1,000 each. This approach solves long-standing accessibility issues, making PCHAIN a prime candidate for those searching for the best altcoin to become a millionaire. The built-in AI can autonomously execute trades when certain conditions arise, such as growing demand for short-term rentals. This hands-off approach caters to individuals who lack the time or expertise to constantly monitor market shifts, reinforcing why many believe PCHAIN is the best altcoin for strong returns. A metaverse component further amplifies PCHAIN’s appeal by enabling virtual property tours. Instead of traveling overseas, buyers can walk through farmland or office buildings using immersive 3D technology, inspecting locations for design features and local amenities. This functionality breaks down geographical barriers, connecting global investors in real-time. Combined with an automated transaction system run by audited smart contracts, PCHAIN significantly reduces friction in property investing. All revenue disbursements, whether from rent, leasing, or crop sales, are handled by transparent code, with results publicly verifiable. With robust technological underpinnings and a focus on bridging crypto with tangible assets, PCHAIN positions itself as a formidable altcoin in a crowded marketplace. According to the expert, these real-world utilities might drive PCHAIN to outperform more speculative coins, securing its place as the best altcoin for substantial future gains. PCHAIN: The Altcoin Poised to Create Millionaires Through Real Estate and AI Innovation Identifying the best altcoin to become a millionaire has always been challenging, given the relentless pace of crypto innovation. Yet experts remain confident that PCHAIN might fulfill that role by 2025. Its approach to tokenizing real estate, integrating AI analytics, and hosting immersive metaverse tours means it could attract both crypto veterans and newcomers intrigued by income-producing assets. The ongoing presale underscores market enthusiasm, as the project has already secured more than $2 million and offers compelling potential for further growth. PCHAIN stands out as a practical solution in a sea of theoretical ideas, a factor that differentiates it from other contenders for the title of best altcoin. Fractional property ownership and automated transactions simplify the investment experience, allowing everyday individuals to participate in high-value sectors once exclusive to major players. Should property listings expand, user adoption widens, and AI functionalities continue to evolve, PCHAIN might become the altcoin that surpasses early expectations. Security is addressed through extensive auditing. PCHAIN uses smart contracts scrutinized by BlockAudit , ensuring reliable performance. Its listing on CoinMarketCap enhances credibility, while the official website provides a detailed roadmap and real-time updates. For many observers, the token’s upward trajectory from $0.011 in the second round to a possible $0.032 listing signals more than just short-term profitability. It hints at a transformative ecosystem that could redefine real estate’s global reach. If PCHAIN achieves its full vision, the market stands to gain a highly valuable altcoin capable of sustained growth. Investors seeking the best altcoin to become a millionaire may find their answer in this project, as its hybrid blend of real-world impact, advanced technology, and robust community support places it in a prime position for success.

40568992,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131183,1740024116,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Exclusive Insights: Robinhood Reveals Secure Crypto Listing Process Amid Memecoin Frenzy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/secure-crypto-listings-robinhood/,"In the ever-turbulent world of cryptocurrency, where new digital assets emerge daily and memecoins capture fleeting internet fame, some platforms are prioritizing stability and security over rapid expansion. Robinhood, a popular investment and trading platform, is firmly planting its flag in the ground, emphasizing a strict crypto listing process . Johann Kerbrat, Robinhood’s Vice President and General Manager of Crypto, recently shed light on the company’s meticulous approach at Consensus Hong Kong 2025, signaling a commitment to quality over quantity in their digital asset offerings. This revelation comes at a crucial time, as the crypto market grapples with volatility and the persistent allure of speculative memecoins. Let’s dive into what makes Robinhood’s strategy stand out and what it means for the future of crypto investment. What Makes Robinhood’s Crypto Listing Process So Strict? Robinhood currently supports 22 crypto assets, a relatively small number compared to some exchanges boasting hundreds, if not thousands, of listings. Kerbrat’s statements at Consensus Hong Kong underscore that this isn’t a matter of capability, but rather a conscious choice driven by stringent evaluation criteria. According to Odaily’s report, the core pillars of Robinhood’s crypto listing process are: Security First: This isn’t just a buzzword for Robinhood. Security is paramount. They meticulously assess the security infrastructure of each potential crypto asset to protect users from vulnerabilities and potential exploits. This includes evaluating the underlying blockchain technology, smart contract audits, and the overall security practices of the project team. Liquidity Assurance: Beyond security, liquidity is a critical factor. Robinhood ensures that listed assets have sufficient trading volume and market depth. This is crucial for users to be able to buy and sell assets efficiently and at fair prices, minimizing slippage and ensuring a smooth trading experience. These two factors – security and liquidity – form the bedrock of Robinhood’s decision-making. It’s a calculated approach that prioritizes user safety and market integrity over simply chasing listing numbers. Why Focus on Crypto Security and Liquidity? In the volatile crypto landscape, the emphasis on crypto security and liquidity is not just prudent, it’s essential. Let’s break down why these aspects are so critical: Factor Importance Impact on Users Security Protects against hacks, exploits, and theft. Ensures the integrity of user funds and data. Safeguards investments and personal information. Builds trust in the platform and the listed assets. Liquidity Enables smooth and efficient trading. Reduces price volatility and slippage. Allows users to buy and sell assets quickly at desired prices. Provides a stable and reliable trading environment. Ignoring these fundamental aspects can lead to significant risks for investors. Platforms that rush to list assets without proper due diligence may expose their users to: Security Breaches: Vulnerable smart contracts or blockchain networks can be exploited, leading to loss of funds. Market Manipulation: Illiquid markets are more susceptible to manipulation, where large players can easily sway prices to the detriment of smaller investors. Rug Pulls and Scams: Lack of thorough vetting can allow fraudulent projects to get listed, leading to devastating losses for unsuspecting users. Robinhood’s cautious approach is a deliberate countermeasure to these risks, aiming to create a safer and more reliable environment for crypto trading. Memecoin Hype vs. Real Crypto Adoption: Where Does Robinhood Stand? Kerbrat directly addressed the elephant in the room – memecoins. He acknowledged their ability to generate significant buzz and community discussion. However, he astutely pointed out that the crypto narrative shouldn’t be solely dominated by fleeting trends. There’s a broader, more substantial story unfolding in the crypto space, one that involves the increasing Ethereum Solana adoption and the robust institutional interest in stablecoins. While memecoins capture headlines with their viral nature and potential for quick gains (and equally rapid losses), Kerbrat emphasizes the importance of recognizing the underlying technological advancements and real-world applications driving crypto adoption. Assets like Ethereum and Solana are not just speculative tokens; they are platforms enabling decentralized applications (dApps), powering NFTs, and facilitating the growth of Web3. Their value proposition extends far beyond internet memes and social media trends. Furthermore, the “strong institutional demand for stablecoins” highlights a crucial aspect of crypto maturity. Stablecoins, pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, provide a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world. Institutional investors, often seeking stability and regulated exposure, are increasingly turning to stablecoins as a gateway into the digital asset market. This institutional interest signals a deeper, more sustainable form of crypto adoption beyond the retail-driven frenzy around memecoins. Robinhood’s Crypto Asset Selection: A Curated Approach While Robinhood hasn’t explicitly disclosed the entire list of its 22 supported cryptocurrencies in this context, their selective approach is evident. By prioritizing Robinhood crypto listing of assets that meet stringent security and liquidity criteria, they are curating a portfolio focused on established and fundamentally sound projects. This likely includes major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), alongside other prominent and reputable digital assets. This curated selection stands in stark contrast to platforms that list a vast array of cryptocurrencies, many of which may be highly speculative, lack robust security, or suffer from low liquidity. Robinhood’s strategy reflects a commitment to providing users with access to a vetted and reliable set of crypto assets, aligning with a long-term vision for sustainable crypto adoption. Navigating the Future of Crypto Listings: A Balanced Perspective Robinhood’s stance on crypto listings offers valuable insights into the evolving dynamics of the digital asset market. While the allure of quick gains from memecoins is undeniable, the platform’s emphasis on security, liquidity, and real technological adoption presents a more balanced and responsible perspective. For investors, understanding these nuances is crucial for navigating the complexities of the crypto world. Here are some key takeaways: Due Diligence is Paramount: Whether you are a platform evaluating listings or an individual investor choosing assets, thorough due diligence is non-negotiable. Assess security, liquidity, and the underlying fundamentals of any crypto project. Beyond the Hype: Don’t get solely caught up in the memecoin frenzy. Recognize the value and potential of projects driving real technological innovation and adoption, like Ethereum and Solana. Institutional Signals: Pay attention to institutional trends. The growing institutional interest in stablecoins and select cryptocurrencies signals a maturing market and a shift towards more sustainable growth. Platform Choices Matter: Choose platforms that prioritize security and user protection. Robinhood’s approach highlights the importance of platform responsibility in the crypto ecosystem. In conclusion, Robinhood’s exclusive crypto listing strategy, as highlighted by Johann Kerbrat, serves as a crucial reminder that in the fast-paced and often volatile crypto market, a focus on security, liquidity, and genuine technological advancement is paramount. While memecoins may offer fleeting moments of excitement, the long-term future of crypto hinges on building a secure, reliable, and fundamentally sound ecosystem. Robinhood’s approach is a step in that direction, advocating for a more responsible and sustainable path for crypto adoption.

The SEC’s filing, which was made public today, states that it is withdrawing the appeal under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 42(b). Both sides have agreed that each party will bear its own costs, with the plaintiffs — including the Blockchain Association — not opposing the motion. The SEC had initially appealed a district court ruling from November 2024, which had favored the plaintiffs and criticized the agency’s rulemaking as overreaching. The rule in question had raised concerns across the crypto industry, as it potentially threatened to stifle innovation and disrupt the growth of digital assets by imposing unnecessary regulations on digital asset dealers. The Blockchain Association had argued that the SEC’s actions were harmful to the industry, claiming the agency’s stance amounted to unjustified regulatory overreach. 1/ Today marks a complete victory for us – and the broader industry – in our lawsuit against the SEC over the dealer rule.

40569150,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131221,1740024414,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Decoding DXY’s Subdued Trading: Is a Powerful Rebound Imminent?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/decoding-dxy-subdued-trading/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency and Forex trading, staying ahead of market movements is crucial. Today, we delve into the subdued trading of the US Dollar Index (DXY) , a key indicator for Forex traders globally. Despite a touch of firmness fueled by hawkish remarks from Federal Reserve officials, the DXY is experiencing a period of calm before potentially significant economic data releases. Let’s break down what’s happening and what it means for your trading strategy. Decoding the Subdued DXY Trading According to OCBC’s FX analyst Christopher Wong, the US Dollar Index is currently navigating a landscape shaped by ‘hawkish Fedspeaks.’ Several factors are contributing to this subdued yet potentially volatile environment: Hawkish Fed Rhetoric: Federal Reserve officials like Daly and Waller are signaling a cautious approach to monetary policy. Daly emphasized the need for restrictive policies until substantial progress on inflation is evident. Waller suggested holding rates steady until a clear decline in inflation, similar to the trends observed in 2024, is confirmed. Upcoming Economic Data: This week is packed with critical economic releases that could significantly influence the US Dollar Index . Traders are keenly awaiting: Housing Starts and Building Permits (today) FOMC Minutes (Thursday, 3 am SGT) Preliminary PMIs (Friday) Technical Indicators: Current technical analysis presents a mixed picture. Daily momentum is bearish, but there’s a moderation in the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Intriguingly, a potential bullish divergence on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is forming, hinting at a possible shift in momentum. Near-Term Rebound Risks and Key Levels for DXY While the current trading might be subdued, ruling out a near-term rebound for the US Dollar Index would be premature. Wong highlights critical resistance and support levels that traders should monitor closely: Level Type Level Significance Resistance 1 107.30 23.6% Fibonacci retracement Resistance 2 107.80 21-day Moving Average (DMA) Resistance 3 108.50 Support 106.20/40 100-day Moving Average (DMA), 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of October low to January high According to OCBC, ‘Better prints’ in the upcoming economic data could bolster the US Dollar’s rebound momentum. Traders should pay close attention to these levels as potential breakout or breakdown points. Trump’s Tariffs: A Muted Forex Reaction So Far Overnight, news broke regarding former President Trump’s announcement of potential tariffs. He stated intentions to impose a 25% tariff on autos, pharmaceuticals, and chips, effective April 2nd. This follows his earlier tariff of 25% on all steel and aluminum imports, set for March 12th. Interestingly, the Forex market reaction to these tariff announcements has been relatively muted. Analysts suggest this is because such measures were somewhat anticipated. However, the ‘bigger uncertainty’ revolves around potential reciprocal tariffs from other nations, details of which are expected to emerge later. These reciprocal tariffs could introduce more volatility into the Forex market and impact the US Dollar Index . Actionable Insights for Forex Traders What does this subdued trading and potential for rebound mean for Forex traders, especially those involved in cryptocurrency markets? Monitor Economic Data: The upcoming housing data, FOMC minutes, and PMIs are crucial. Better-than-expected figures could strengthen the US Dollar Index . Watch Key Levels: Keep a close eye on the resistance levels (107.30, 107.80, 108.50) and support levels (106.20/40) for potential trading opportunities. A break above resistance could signal a bullish move, while a break below support might indicate further downside. Stay Informed on Tariffs: While the initial reaction to Trump’s tariffs was muted, be prepared for potential volatility as details on reciprocal tariffs emerge. These could have a more significant impact on currency valuations. Consider Fed Stance: The Federal Reserve’s cautious and data-dependent approach means that economic data will play an even more critical role in shaping interest rates expectations and, consequently, the US Dollar Index . Conclusion: Navigating the DXY’s Subdued Phase The US Dollar Index is currently in a phase of subdued trading, influenced by hawkish Fed rhetoric and anticipation of key economic data releases. While daily momentum appears bearish, technical indicators hint at a potential bullish divergence, suggesting a possible rebound. Forex traders should remain vigilant, monitoring economic data, key technical levels, and developments regarding international trade policies to effectively navigate the market and capitalize on potential opportunities as the DXY finds its next direction.

However, fear is growing as Pi Coin has already plunged 55%, now trading around $30. This sudden drop has fueled speculation that the mainnet launch could lead to further bigger drop ahead. Profit-Taking Opportunity for Early Miners One of the biggest risks for Pi coin comes from early miners. These miners have accumulated Pi tokens at little to no cost, and are likely to view the mainnet launch as their first real opportunity to monetize their holdings. For these individuals, selling a portion of their tokens could be a strategic move to lock in profits, especially if they believe the initial market price will be higher due to hype and speculation. If a significant number of early miners decide to sell simultaneously, the market could experience a rapid increase in supply, potentially reducing the demand and this could lead to a sharp price decline. Market Trends and Technical Indicators Following the official announcement of the mainnet launch , the price of the Pi token jumped by almost 90%, climbing from $49 to $92. But this rise didn’t last long, as prices have fallen sharply since then. Meanwhile, technical signs also show that Pi’s price is struggling. The token recently fell below a key support level at $40, which had earlier helped keep the price stable. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures whether a token is overbought or oversold, recently entered the overbought zone for Pi. However, it quickly dropped in the last 24 hours. In the past, tokens that hit this zone often saw their prices reverse and fall. This could mean more price drops are coming for Pi. The Airdrop Effect: A Common Trend? History has shown that cryptocurrencies launched through airdrops often experience significant price declines. When tokens are distributed for free or at a low cost, many recipients rush to sell their holdings as soon as trading begins. Pi Network could follow a similar pattern, with an oversupply of tokens hitting the market and driving prices lower. Pi Price Hints Major Lose Ahead As of now PI, I owe you (IOU), price has seen a sharp decline, now trading at $32 after dropping 57% in just 24 hours. This crash happened after the token failed to stay above the $50 support level. With the upcoming mainnet launch, uncertainty is growing, and Pi’s price could face more downward pressure. While it is still holding above $30, breaking below this level might trigger a further drop to $17. If that happens, investors who have been holding Pi in recent weeks could face even bigger losses.",News,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|AIRDROP|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-20 04:11:43

40570510,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131290,1740026978,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Gold Price Tumbles From Record High: Is the All Time High Surge Over?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gold-price-all-time-high/,"Just as cryptocurrency markets experience their characteristic volatility, traditional safe-haven assets like Gold are also subject to market fluctuations. After reaching a breathtaking All Time High , Gold (XAU/USD) has surprised investors with a sudden retreat. What triggered this reversal, and is this a temporary dip or the start of a larger correction? Let’s dive into the factors influencing the Gold Price and what it means for traders and investors alike. Gold Price Hits Dizzying All Time High Before Pullback Gold’s journey to its latest All Time High has been nothing short of dramatic. Earlier this Wednesday, the precious metal soared to a fresh peak of $2,945 during the European trading session. This surge was fueled by a confluence of factors, including geopolitical anxieties stemming from renewed tensions between the US and Russia, and President Trump’s assertive stance on trade. His administration’s continued focus on tariffs, particularly on automobile, pharmaceutical, and semiconductor imports, injected uncertainty into the global economic outlook, traditionally bullish for Gold Price . However, the celebratory mood was short-lived. As the US trading session commenced, Gold’s upward momentum stalled, and prices retraced back to flat. This shift coincided with the release of unexpectedly weak US Mortgage Rates data, a critical indicator of economic health. Weak Mortgage Rates Data Cools Down Gold’s Rally The catalyst for Gold’s retreat appears to be the concerning drop in weekly US Mortgage Rates Applications. This week saw a significant 6.6% decrease, signaling a potential cooling in the housing market. Here’s a breakdown of why this data point matters and its impact on Gold: Economic Indicator: Mortgage applications are a leading indicator of home sales and housing market activity. A decline suggests weakening economic momentum. Dollar Strength: Weaker mortgage data can sometimes strengthen the US Dollar as investors anticipate potential Federal Reserve responses, although in this instance, the initial reaction was a dollar boost, impacting Gold negatively. Safe Haven Shift: While Gold is a safe haven, a stronger dollar can make gold less attractive to overseas buyers, exerting downward pressure on the Gold Price . The drop in Mortgage Rates applications injected a dose of reality into the market, prompting some profit-taking after Gold’s rapid ascent to record levels. Traders are now reassessing the sustainability of Gold’s rally in light of these emerging economic headwinds. Trump’s Tariffs and Geopolitical Tensions: A Double-Edged Sword for Gold President Trump’s pronouncements continue to be a significant market mover. His recent remarks, including harsh words regarding Ukraine and the reaffirmation of 25% tariffs on key imports, initially propelled Gold Price higher. Let’s examine the impact of these factors: Geopolitical Uncertainty: Trump’s comments on Ukraine, coupled with ongoing US-Russia talks, introduced geopolitical jitters, increasing demand for safe-haven assets like Gold. Tariff Threats: The confirmation of new tariffs on automobiles, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals amplifies trade war concerns. Historically, trade tensions have been positive for Gold Price due to increased economic uncertainty and potential inflation. Economic Impact of Tariffs: While tariffs can initially boost domestic industries, they can also lead to higher consumer prices and retaliatory measures, potentially harming overall economic growth in the long run, which could eventually weigh on Gold if broader economic downturn materializes. While Trump’s policies can be seen as a bullish catalyst for Gold Price in the short term due to uncertainty, the potential for broader economic instability introduces complexities. FOMC Minutes on the Horizon: Will the Fed Spoil the Party? Adding another layer of intrigue to the market narrative is the impending release of the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) January FOMC Minutes. Scheduled for release at 19:00 GMT, these minutes could be a crucial turning point for Gold Price . Here’s what to watch for: Rate Stance: Recent statements from Fed officials suggest a cautious approach, indicating that current interest rates are considered “reasonable.” However, any hints of renewed inflation concerns could signal potential future rate hikes. Market Impact: Hawkish signals from the FOMC Minutes – indicating a potential for higher interest rates – could strengthen the US Dollar and put downward pressure on Gold Price . Conversely, dovish signals could support Gold. Volatility Trigger: The FOMC Minutes are a major market event and are likely to inject volatility into the Gold Price and broader financial markets. Traders are keenly awaiting the FOMC Minutes to gauge the Fed’s outlook and potential policy shifts, which will significantly influence the near-term direction of the Gold Price . Technical Analysis: Is This an All Time High Rejection for Gold? From a technical perspective, Gold’s price action on Wednesday presents a potentially precarious scenario. The failure to sustain gains above the fresh All Time High of $2,945 could be interpreted as a rejection. Key technical levels to monitor include: Support Levels Resistance Levels Pivot Point: $2,921 R1 Resistance: $2,951 S1 Support: $2,906 R2 Resistance: $2,966 Target: $3,000 (Psychological Level) A break below the daily Pivot Point at $2,921 could signal further downside, with the S1 support at $2,906 as the next critical level. Conversely, a move above the R1 resistance at $2,951 would be needed to re-establish bullish momentum and target the elusive $3,000 mark. Tariffs Explained: Understanding Trump’s Trade Weapon Given the significant role of tariffs in the current market narrative, let’s briefly revisit what tariffs are and their implications: Tariffs FAQs What are tariffs? Tariffs are essentially taxes imposed on imported goods. They are designed to make domestic products more competitive by increasing the price of imports. Taxes vs. Tariffs: While both generate government revenue, tariffs are paid by importers at the port of entry, whereas taxes are paid by consumers or businesses at the point of sale or income generation. Are tariffs good or bad? Economists are divided. Some argue tariffs protect domestic industries and correct trade imbalances. Others contend they lead to higher prices, harm consumers, and can trigger damaging trade wars. Trump’s Tariff Plan: President Trump aims to use tariffs aggressively, particularly targeting imports from Mexico, China, and Canada. He intends to use tariff revenue to fund income tax cuts, further impacting the economic landscape. Conclusion: Navigating Gold’s Volatile Path Gold Price’s journey to a new All Time High followed by a swift retreat underscores the complex interplay of factors influencing precious metals markets. Weak Mortgage Rates data has injected caution, while Trump’s tariffs and geopolitical tensions continue to create a backdrop of uncertainty. The upcoming Fed Minutes are poised to be a critical determinant of Gold’s near-term direction. For investors and traders, vigilance and a nuanced understanding of these converging forces are paramount to navigating Gold’s potentially volatile path ahead. Keep a close eye on economic data releases, geopolitical developments, and central bank communications to stay ahead in this dynamic market.

This significant funding underscores the rising importance of AI in manufacturing , as companies increasingly seek innovative solutions to optimize their operations and minimize downtime. Augury’s cutting-edge technology focuses on predictive maintenance , leveraging AI to detect and diagnose malfunctions in factory machinery before they lead to costly breakdowns. Why is Predictive Maintenance a Game Changer for Factories? Imagine a world where factory machines could communicate their health status in real-time, alerting maintenance teams to potential issues before they escalate into major problems. This is the promise of predictive maintenance , and it’s becoming a reality thanks to companies like Augury. Their AI-powered sensors monitor crucial machine parameters like vibrations, sound, and temperature, creating a comprehensive ‘malfunction dictionary’ based on billions of hours of machine operation data. This vast dataset allows Augury’s system to identify anomalies and accurately predict when a machine might need attention, and even pinpoint the exact nature of the problem. The benefits of such a system are immense, especially for industries heavily reliant on continuous operation. Let’s break down the key advantages: Reduced Downtime: By predicting failures, factories can schedule maintenance proactively, minimizing unexpected shutdowns and keeping production lines running smoothly. This is crucial in today’s fast-paced manufacturing environment where downtime can translate to significant financial losses. Optimized Maintenance Schedules: Instead of relying on fixed, time-based maintenance schedules, factories can adopt a condition-based approach. This means maintenance is performed only when needed, saving time and resources while extending the lifespan of machinery. Improved Efficiency and Productivity: With machines operating at peak performance and fewer unexpected breakdowns, overall factory efficiency and productivity are significantly boosted. This directly impacts the bottom line and enhances competitiveness. Cost Savings: From reduced downtime and optimized maintenance to preventing catastrophic failures, predictive maintenance translates to substantial cost savings in the long run. These savings can be reinvested in other areas of the business, driving further growth and innovation. The Rise of Industrial AI Funding and Augury’s Position Augury’s successful Series F funding round, led by Lightrock, with participation from prominent investors like Insight Venture Partners and Qualcomm Ventures, is a testament to the growing investor confidence in industrial AI funding . The $72.5 million raised will fuel Augury’s expansion, allowing them to onboard new customers and further develop their groundbreaking technology. This investment arrives at a pivotal moment as industries globally are recognizing the urgent need for digital transformation, particularly on the factory floor. CEO and founder Saar Yoskovitz highlights the vast data advantage Augury possesses, stating, “We have by far the largest data set of mechanical signals.” This ‘malfunction dictionary,’ encompassing over half a billion hours of machine operations across diverse equipment types, is a significant competitive edge. It allows Augury’s AI to provide highly accurate and reliable predictive maintenance insights, even for machines they’ve never encountered before. Machine Learning at the Heart of Factory Automation Machine learning is the engine driving Augury’s innovation. Their AI algorithms are trained on massive datasets of machine operational data, learning to identify subtle patterns and anomalies that indicate impending failures. This sophisticated machine learning approach goes beyond simple threshold-based monitoring, enabling the system to understand the complex interplay of factors that contribute to machine health. Augury’s technology can be seamlessly integrated into both legacy ‘brownfield’ environments (80% of their deployments) and modern ‘greenfield’ factories. This adaptability makes it a versatile solution for a wide range of industrial settings, irrespective of the age or sophistication of existing infrastructure. As factory automation continues to evolve, machine learning powered predictive maintenance solutions like Augury’s are poised to become indispensable for manufacturers seeking to stay ahead of the curve. Addressing the Talent Gap in Manufacturing with AI Interestingly, Augury’s solution is not positioned as a job-displacing technology. Instead, CEO Yoskovitz emphasizes that it addresses a critical challenge facing the manufacturing sector: the talent shortage. With an aging workforce and a lack of new talent entering the field, factories are facing a growing expertise gap. Augury’s AI essentially ‘digitizes the knowledge’ of experienced technicians, making it accessible to a new generation of workers who may lack the same level of hands-on experience. This empowers factories to maintain operational efficiency even amidst workforce transitions. The Sustainable Angle: Green Manufacturing Through AI Lightrock, the lead investor in this round, has a strong focus on sustainability, and Augury aligns perfectly with this ethos. By enabling manufacturers to extend the lifespan of their existing equipment and optimize resource utilization, Augury contributes to ‘sustainable capitalism.’ As Ashish Puri, a partner at Lightrock, points out, factories often operate machines for decades. Predictive maintenance helps ensure these machines run efficiently for longer, reducing waste, minimizing the need for premature replacements, and contributing to a more environmentally responsible manufacturing sector. This sustainable approach is increasingly important for businesses striving to reduce their carbon footprint and operate more responsibly. Augury’s latest funding round is not just a financial milestone; it’s a powerful signal of the transformative potential of AI in manufacturing . As industries worldwide embrace digitalization and seek to optimize their operations, solutions like Augury’s predictive maintenance platform are set to play a crucial role in shaping the future of factories. By combining cutting-edge machine learning with practical industrial applications, Augury is empowering manufacturers to achieve unprecedented levels of efficiency, sustainability, and resilience.

Renewed tariff threats from former President Trump are injecting volatility into global markets, and the USD is emerging as a clear winner. Let’s dive into what’s driving this surge and what it means for your crypto portfolio, based on insights from Scotiabank. Why is the US Dollar (USD) Gaining Ground? According to Scotiabank’s Chief FX Strategist Shaun Osborne, the US Dollar’s strength is directly linked to renewed trade tensions. Trump’s recent suggestion of imposing hefty auto tariffs, potentially around 25%, along with similar tariffs on pharmaceutical and chip imports by April 2nd, has rattled global investors. This has led to: Stock Market Jitters: Global stock markets are reacting negatively to the prospect of increased tariffs, fearing a slowdown in international trade and economic growth. Fixed Income Drag: Even fixed income markets are feeling the pressure, indicating a broader unease across asset classes. Safe Haven Demand: In times of economic uncertainty, the US Dollar is often seen as a safe haven asset. Investors flock to the USD , increasing demand and pushing its value higher. Scotiabank’s Forex Insights: Decoding the Dollar’s Dominance Scotiabank’s analysis provides a deeper understanding of the current forex landscape. Here’s a breakdown of their key observations: Marginal Yield Firming: While US Treasury yields have seen a slight increase, European debt markets are experiencing a more significant rise in 10-year yields (3-5bps). This divergence suggests that Europe might be more sensitive to the tariff threats, or that the market perceives the US economy as relatively more resilient. Tranquil Forex Market (Relatively): Despite the underlying tensions, the forex market is described as “relatively tranquil.” Currency ranges are tight, and while the USD is firmer, it’s not a universal surge across all currency pairs. This suggests a measured, rather than panicked, market reaction – so far. Kiwi Outperformance & Aussie Bid: The New Zealand Dollar (NZD) is surprisingly outperforming after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) implemented another significant 50bps rate cut. However, the RBNZ also hinted at a potential slowdown in the pace of future rate cuts, which seems to have reassured markets. The Australian Dollar (AUD) is also benefiting slightly from the Kiwi’s positive momentum. Japanese Yen (JPY) Strength: The Japanese Yen (JPY) is showing moderate strength following hawkish comments from Bank of Japan (BoJ) member Takata. Takata suggested that the BoJ should consider gradually tightening monetary policy to manage inflation risks. Market expectations for BoJ tightening in June have increased, reflecting this sentiment. Euro (EUR) and British Pound (GBP) Under Pressure: The Euro (EUR) is the weakest performer, falling back to the 1.04 level. The British Pound (GBP) is also under pressure after mixed UK inflation data. This highlights the US Dollar’s relative strength compared to major European currencies in the current environment. What’s Next for the Forex Markets and the USD? Looking ahead, several key events and data releases will likely influence the forex market and the US Dollar’s trajectory: US Housing Data: Housing Starts and Building Permits data from the US are due later today. These figures can provide insights into the health of the US economy. Federal Reserve (Fed) Minutes: The minutes from the January Federal Reserve policy meeting will be released at 14:00 ET. Market participants will scrutinize these minutes for clues about the Fed’s future policy direction and its assessment of the inflation outlook. FOMC Speaker Jefferson: FOMC voter Jefferson is scheduled to speak at 17:00 ET. His comments will be closely watched for further insights into the Fed’s thinking. Mexican Inflation Report: The Mexican central bank will release its inflation report at 13:30 ET. While less directly impactful on the USD , global inflation data is always relevant to the broader economic picture. Navigating Forex Frenzy: Key Takeaways for Crypto Traders The current market dynamics, driven by tariff threats and a stronger US Dollar , present both challenges and opportunities for cryptocurrency traders: USD Strength and Crypto: A stronger US Dollar can sometimes exert downward pressure on cryptocurrency prices, as many cryptocurrencies are priced against the dollar. However, this isn’t always a direct correlation, and other factors like risk sentiment and specific crypto narratives play a significant role. Volatility on the Horizon: Tariff uncertainties and central bank policy adjustments are likely to increase market volatility across both traditional and crypto markets. Be prepared for potential price swings. Monitor Fed Minutes: Pay close attention to the Fed minutes and FOMC speaker comments. Any hints about future interest rate policy or inflation concerns can significantly impact market sentiment and the US Dollar’s value. Diversification is Key: In times of uncertainty, diversification across different asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, can be a prudent strategy to manage risk. Will the USD’s Rally Continue? Scotiabank suggests that the US Dollar’s rebound may have further to run, but perhaps not excessively. They draw a parallel to the early days of the first Trump administration, noting that the DXY ( US Dollar Index) is roughly tracking a similar pattern. If this historical analogy holds, the DXY could potentially edge back towards the low to mid-108s in the coming weeks. However, this outlook is contingent on clarity regarding the tariff situation.

40570916,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=678533,1740027383,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40570916.jpeg,President Trump orders gold inspection at Fort Knox ahead of D.O.G.E audit,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-orders-gold-inspection-at-fort-knox/,"President Donald Trump has ordered an immediate gold inspection at Fort Knox, raising doubts over whether the 4,580 tons of gold stored in America’s most restricted vault still exist. Speaking aboard Air Force One on his way back from Miami to Washington, Trump told reporters: “We hope everything’s fine with Fort Knox, but we’re going to go to Fort Knox—the favorite Fort Knox—to make sure the gold is there. If the gold isn’t there, we’re going to be very upset.” His decision comes at a time when Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) is preparing a nationwide audit of US assets, and a simple question on X has now turned into a political firestorm. Elon Musk questions US gold reserves, D.O.G.E jumps in It all started when an X user asked Elon if the gold at Fort Knox still exists. His response? “Surely it’s reviewed at least every year.” That assumption turned out to be wrong. The last time anyone saw the gold was in 2017, when Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin paid a visit. Before that it was in 1974 when reporters and lawmakers were given a rare glimpse inside after conspiracy theories about missing gold started spreading. The US Treasury claims Fort Knox holds gold worth $425 billion at today’s prices, but no independent verification has taken place in nearly 50 years. The vault remains one of the most heavily guarded locations on Earth, and no single person alive knows all the steps required to open it. Musk’s casual post triggered outrage across Washington, prompting Senator Rand Paul to demand an official audit of the reserves. “Nope. Let’s do it,” Rand wrote, reiterating once again that he doesn’t believe the government’s numbers. His father, Ron Paul, has been pushing for gold audits for decades, insisting that Americans have no proof the gold even exists. Senator Cynthia Lummis took the debate even further, calling for a super radical change. “Bitcoin fixes this,” she told Musk. “A bitcoin reserve could be audited anytime 24/7 with a basic computer. It’s time to upgrade our reserves.” Musk, who has flirted with pro-Bitcoin ideas in the past, responded with a thinking emoji, hinting that he might actually consider it. Bitcoin’s blockchain is fully transparent, unlike Fort Knox, which remains sealed away with no public access. Lummis has been pushing for the US to create a Bitcoin reserve, believing that it’s superior to gold in every way. Trump orders Pentagon spending cuts as part of D.O.G.E’s efficiency mission While the gold drama unfolds, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has been given a new directive—cut 8% from the Pentagon’s $850 billion budget every year for the next five years. This is also part of D.O.G.E’s latest cost-cutting mission, and Hegseth wasted no time getting to work. “The time for preparation is over—we must act urgently to revive the warrior ethos, rebuild our military, and reestablish deterrence,” Hegseth wrote in a memo to top Pentagon officials, senior commanders, and agency directors on Wednesday. He ordered them to draft plans for the spending cuts by February 24, but the details are still unclear. If carried out, the reductions would cut roughly $68 billion per year from defense spending, which could reshape the entire military structure. Trump himself has been floating an even bigger cut—reducing the Pentagon’s budget in half once geopolitical tensions ease. “At some point, when things settle down, I’m going to meet with China and Russia, in particular those two, and I’m going to say there’s no reason for us to be spending almost $1 trillion on the military,” he told the reporters on Air Force One. “When we straighten it all out, then one of the first meetings I want to have is with President Xi Jinping of China and President Vladimir Putin of Russia, and I want to say let’s cut our military budget in half. And we can do that, and I think we’ll be able to do that.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",News|D.O.G.E,EN,0,0,FIAT|DOGE|REGULATION|BTC|ASIA,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-20 04:56:23

This could be a welcome development as crypto ETFs were barred from staking under the SEC chairmanship of Gary Gensler, noting that it violated securities laws. Will the US SEC Approve Ethereum ETF Staking? Although, the US CFTC has acknowledged Ethereum as a “commodity”, the US SEC has yet to clearly state its position on ETH, whether it’s a security or a commodity. During the approval of the spot Ethereum ETF last year, the SEC had its own contentions over approving the staking feature. One of the major concerns the securities agency had was that the service provider i.e. crypto exchange would operate and promote staking as “an investment product” while guaranteeing a certain rate of return. The agency believed that this operating method was unclear and that the investor protection measures were insufficient. The question here is what has changed now with the SEC, which is that 21Shares is applying for a staking facility on its Ether ETF. Will the Cboe application manager circumvent SEC regulations? Here’s How CETH Plans to Offer Staking Facility The 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF (CETH) is staked by entrusting it to a custodian i.e. staking provider and no ETH will be moved from the wallet during the staking period. Moreover, CETH affiliates and sponsors won’t be able to become staking affiliates. CryptoQuant analyst Mignolet has emphasized the importance of enhancing transparency in exchange staking services to address concerns surrounding fund safety and operational clarity. “If we choose an unrelated provider to increase transparency and avoid moving funds from the custodian’s wallet, we can eliminate unnecessary risks like hacking or the illegal use of customer funds,” he stated. Staking Ethereum Directly Furthermore, the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF (CETH) will directly stake Ethereum held by the company itself and does not involve Ethereum collected from external investors for staking. This distinction is a crucial factor in assessing the risks associated with exchange staking, according to Mignolet. “Exchange staking is fundamentally a service, but it poses significant risks for individuals staking on these platforms,” Mignolet stated . The analyst further underscored the SEC’s stance on the matter, noting, “As the SEC pointed out, platforms should not promote or guarantee specific returns from staking.” As the CETH filing addresses all these issues, there won’t be major hurdles in the SEC approval, stated the analyst. Earlier in February, Cboe also submitted an application for the trading of options on spot Ether ETFs . Ethereum ETF Inflows Continue Despite the strong crypto market turbulence in February, the Ether ETF inflows have remained healthy with BlackRock’s ETHA leading. On Wednesday, the net inflows stood at $19 million, with Fidelity’s FETH leading with $24.5 million in inflows. As of press time, Ethereum price is trading 2% up at $2,745 amid a broader crypto market recovery. On the other hand, the Ethereum network transaction fee has dropped to just $0.41 hitting a four-year low.

The initiative, dubbed RWAccelerator, offers startups funding, expert mentorship, AI-driven resources and technical support as they build solutions in sectors like real estate, financial products and alternative assets, the companies announced at Consensus Hong Kong . The RWAccelerator comes at a pivotal time for the tokenized asset space. The World Economic Forum estimates that by 2027, 10% of the world’s GDP — around $10 trillion — could be stored on blockchain networks, with RWAs playing a major role in this shift. ""Our mission is really to build that bridge between kind of the large, planetary scale businesses that people use and are familiar with every day, particularly people who are not in the crypto space, and create that on ramp for those folks,"" said Richard Widmann, global head of Web3 strategy at Google Cloud, at Consensus Hong Kong. Startups can apply for one of three tracks: infrastructure, tokenization or decentralized finance (DeFi). Successful applicants will gain access to Google Cloud’s resources, including cloud credits, technical support and workshops led by Google engineers. MANTRA’s own team will offer guidance on everything from smart contracts and tokenomics to legal compliance and market strategies, the press release said. ""This is a powerful opportunity for startups to harness cutting-edge technology and gain access to resources and mentorship,” said John Patrick Mullin, CEO of MANTRA, in a statement. “With support from Google Cloud, this RWAccelerator will allow startups to reach new heights and significantly contribute to the wider Web3 community."" Applications for the first RWAccelerator cohort are open through March 20, 2025, with the program kicking off in Dubai in April. A second intake is scheduled to open the same day the first round closes. The launch of the accelerator follows MANTRA’s recent approval for a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), positioning it to offer exchange, broker-dealer and investment services in the region.

Bitcoin Liquidity Signals A Brutal Squeeze To $111,000",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-liquidity-brutal-squeeze-111000/,"While the Bitcoin price is hovering below the crucial resistance at $96,500, the liquidation heatmap on Binance’s BTC/USDT pair is sending powerful signals of a potential short squeeze to the upside. Analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) shared his insights alongside the attached liquidation heatmap, noting signs of significant liquidity pools forming both above and below Bitcoin’s current trading range. “What we’re seeing over the last couple of days is lining up perfectly with what I have been saying,” Kevin explained, referencing his earlier market calls. “Sweep liquidity towards 91K which we did yesterday. Maybe we take more maybe we don’t but overall I have never seen this much liquidity to the upside on the monthly time frame on #BTC.” According to Kevin, the data strongly suggests that large liquidity—where traders’ positions would be forced to liquidate—is now stacked around the 91K region and, more crucially, near the 111K mark. While the lower zone might still see occasional sweeps, it is the massive cluster of liquidity around 111K that has prompted him to forecast a potential move to that level. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $500,000: Standard Chartered Doubles Down On 2028 Target “There is more emotions in this market right then I have ever seen,”he continued. “Gurus are quitting X, Youtubers aren’t streaming or making content anymore, The comments are hateful and insulting every single day Meanwhile over here we are staying measured and calculated.” Kevin emphasizes that many market participants are fixated on altcoins rather than monitoring Bitcoin’s liquidity structure, overall market capitalization, and USDT dominance. He argues that traders’ narrow focus on individual altcoins, rather than these broader metrics, is causing them to miss critical signals. “The problem is everyone is hyper focused on the wrong thing and that is #Altcoins charts,”he said. “I’m literally giving you the playbook. Follow it.” What The Bitcoin Liquidation Heatmap Tells Us A liquidation heatmap illustrates where large batches of leveraged positions—such as futures or margin trades—are most likely to be force-closed if the price reaches certain levels. When many traders place stop-losses or maintain heavily margined trades around similar price points, these zones often accumulate as “hot spots” on the heatmap. If price action nears these clusters, it can trigger a chain reaction: forced liquidations drive further price movement, which can then cascade into a faster squeeze or sell-off. Related Reading: Bitcoin Meets Fiscal Reality: Fidelity’s Timmer Predicts What’s Next In Kevin’s view, Bitcoin’s heatmap currently shows billions of dollars in potential liquidations concentrated at higher levels (111K) and a significant liquidity block below (around 91K). The presence of this deep liquidity on the upside has led Kevin to anticipate a “bigger relief rally” that might force out short positions en masse. “Now as we can see […] we have billions in liquidity to the upside at 111K. More than I have ever seen on the 1M time frame,” he remarked, emphasizing how unusual he finds this month-long concentration. “It would be totally fine and preferable if we swiped [the 91K area] first to build up even more liquidity to then start the real relief rally.” Alongside liquidity data, Kevin also cites sentiment indicators such as the Fear & Greed Index, currently reflecting a “fear” reading. From his standpoint, this environment suggests that the market’s emotional extremes—coupled with heavy positioning—could be setting the stage for a swift momentum shift higher, as negative sentiment often accompanies local bottoms. “You can tell this relief rally wants to get going but it’s just not totally there yet […] I see no reason to be overly bearish on this market. You guys need to calm down and stop being so angry. Stop being so soft.” At press time, BTC traded at $96,334.

The price is rising and might aim for a fresh move toward the $680 resistance. BNB price is moving higher above the $650 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $660 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $655 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $650 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Eyes Fresh Upside After forming a base above the $630 level, BNB price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $635 and $640 resistance levels. It even recovered above the $650 level, beating Ethereum and Bitcoin . There was a decent move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $682 swing high to the $630 low. However, the bears seem to be active near the $655 and $660 levels. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $655 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $660 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $655 level. The next resistance sits near the $660 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $682 swing high to the $630 low at $662. A clear move above the $662 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $680. A close above the $680 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $700 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $720 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $662 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $650 level. The next major support is near the $642 level. The main support sits at $630. If there is a downside break below the $630 support, the price could drop toward the $612 support.

Research firm Nansen estimates that 86% of those who invested in the memecoin lost money, amounting to a staggering $251 million in total losses. Libra’s market value briefly surged to $4.5 billion after Milei’s endorsement, only to collapse rapidly, wiping out gains for most investors. Meanwhile, a small group of insiders walked away with a combined $180 million in profits. The scandal has raised concerns about the role of political figures in financial markets and the risks associated with volatile digital assets. The Kobeissi Letter @KobeissiLetter · Follow Javier Milei just DESTROYED the memecoin market:Hours ago, Argentinian President Milei launched a memecoin, $LIBRA , for “the growth of their economy.”Within 5 hours, over -$4.4 BILLION of market cap was erased.Is this the biggest rug pull in history?(a thread) 9:29 AM · Feb 15, 2025 32.6K Reply Copy link Read 1.9K replies It has also put the Solana blockchain under scrutiny, as its token and total value locked (TVL) plunged following the fallout. Libra’s rapid rise and collapse The drama began on Friday night when Javier Milei directed his followers to a website claiming to raise funds for small businesses in Argentina through Libra. This triggered a frenzy in the crypto market, with automated trading bots attempting to front-run gains. Within hours, the memecoin’s market value soared to $4.5 billion, attracting thousands of retail investors looking for quick profits. As Nansen’s on-chain data later revealed, a select group of wallets had already positioned themselves to profit. These insiders swiftly liquidated their holdings while retail traders rushed in, creating an artificial price surge before an inevitable crash. By the time Milei deleted his original post on X five hours later, Libra had already plummeted by 80% from its peak. Kelsier Ventures, one of the firms behind the token’s launch, later downplayed Libra as nothing more than a memecoin. This starkly contrasted with its initial presentation as a tool for Argentina’s struggling economy, leaving traders questioning whether they had been misled. Stability of Solana The collapse of Libra has also triggered fears about the stability of the Solana blockchain, which hosted the token alongside thousands of other speculative cryptocurrencies. Solana’s token plunged by 20% from Friday evening through Tuesday, while the total value of assets locked in the network plummeted from $12.1 billion to $8.29 billion, according to DefiLlama data. Investors are now speculating on whether more memecoins could suffer similar fates. The controversy has renewed concerns over the risks of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, where anonymous insiders can manipulate token prices before offloading their holdings onto unsuspecting traders. The backlash against Milei’s involvement in the Libra scandal has raised broader questions about political endorsements in the crypto space. As outrage spread across Argentina, suspicions emerged over whether the president had fallen victim to a scam himself or if his account had been compromised. By Monday, Milei attempted to distance himself from the fiasco, claiming he was unaware of the project’s details before deleting his post. Critics argue that his initial promotion of the token, without prior due diligence, contributed to the massive losses suffered by retail investors. The Libra collapse has reignited debates in Argentina over cryptocurrency regulation and consumer protection, with regulators now facing pressure to clamp down on memecoin speculation. While the crypto market remains largely unregulated, this scandal may accelerate discussions on legal frameworks to prevent similar incidents in the future.

This listing follows today’s announcement from CoinDesk Indices, which has launched two new benchmarks: CoinDesk Memecoin Index – a broad-based index tracking the 50 most liquid memecoins, providing traders and institutions with structured exposure to one of the fastest-growing and volatile segments of the digital asset market. CoinDesk 100 Index – a comprehensive benchmark covering the top 100 digital assets, offering deeper market exposure and a single benchmark for institutional investment products and trading strategies. Bullish has listed perpetual futures on both indices, allowing traders to gain exposure to these benchmarks with deep liquidity and 24/7 trading. This launch builds on the success of the CoinDesk 20 and CoinDesk 80 perpetuals, which have collectively driven over $13.5 billion in volume, with the CoinDesk 80 index perpetual future trading millions daily since January 2025. “CoinDesk Memecoin Index responds to traders’ need for liquidity and volatility while the CoinDesk 100 provides one-stop access to the most liquid tokens,” said Chris Tyrer, VP, Head of Institutional at Bullish. “We are thrilled to continue providing our clients access to the broader digital asset landscape, complementing these indices with our robust regulatory framework.” Why It Matters: The Growing Institutionalization of Crypto Indices CoinDesk Indices’ latest benchmarks come at a time when institutions are looking for trusted, rules-based exposure to crypto markets beyond Bitcoin and ether. With over $30 billion in benchmarked assets, CoinDesk Indices has established itself as the leading provider of institutional-grade digital asset indices. The CoinDesk Memecoin Index provides a structured, equal-weighted measure of the 50 most liquid memecoins. This segment has seen explosive growth in trading volume and derivatives interest, yet lacked a transparent benchmark for price discovery and risk management—until now. “The digital asset market is evolving beyond single-token exposure,” said Alan Campbell, President of CoinDesk Indices. “These indices provide the liquidity and transparency needed for sophisticated trading strategies while enabling institutional market participants to engage with these assets in a structured way.” About the Indices The CoinDesk Memecoin Index: The Institutional-Grade Memecoin Benchmark Tracks the 50 most liquid memecoins, providing structured exposure to a previously unstructured market. Equal-weighted and rebalanced monthly, ensuring representation of both emerging and established tokens. Pulls pricing from both centralized and decentralized exchanges for a comprehensive market view. Perpetual futures now available on Bullish, offering highly liquid derivative trading for the memecoin sector. The CoinDesk 100 Index: The Broadest Tradable Digital Asset Benchmark Combines the CoinDesk 20 (large-cap assets) and CoinDesk 80 (mid- & small-cap assets) into a single benchmark for institutional investors, hedge funds, and trading desks. Market cap-weighted with liquidity screening, designed to be a tradeable and representative benchmark. Provides a single reference point for structured products, ETFs, and risk management strategies. Bullish Expands Crypto Derivatives Offerings Bullish Exchange, which has surpassed $1.1 trillion in cumulative trading volume since its launch, continues to expand its derivatives suite. In the second half of 2024, Bullish averaged over $2 billion in daily trading volume, reinforcing its position as a major player in institutional crypto trading. “We understand that some Memecoins can be an emerging asset class with some real liquidity and institutional interest,” said Edmond Goh, Head of Trading at B2C2. “Despite their speculative nature, we expect indices and perpetual futures to quickly become core trading instruments in the digital assets space. A CoinDesk index that tracks these tokens is an important milestone in building the overall market structure, giving products like derivatives a benchmark to be settled and priced against.” Looking Ahead: The Rise of Index-Based Crypto Trading With the launch of the CoinDesk 100 and Memecoin indices, alongside their corresponding perpetual futures, the market is entering a new phase of structured crypto trading. Whether through futures, structured products, or other investment vehicles, these indices lay the groundwork for a more mature and tradable crypto ecosystem.

With XRP’s RSI hovering near 40%—often a precursor to a rally—investors are watching closely. Moreover, the SEC’s decision on ETF approvals, alongside other factors, could be the spark that propels XRP into uncharted territory. While XRP waits for its next breakout, JetBolt (JBOLT) is shaking up the crypto space with its Zero-Gas Technology, designed to eliminate gas fees and streamline Web3 interactions. With nearly 330 million tokens sold in presale, JetBolt is positioning itself as a game-changer in the blockchain space. Read on and discover the latest market developments from XRP and JetBolt. SEC Acknowledges Spot XRP ETF Filing—Can XRP Demolish $5? With XRP trading around $2.52 today, many investors are now asking: Can XRP reach $5? The question comes amid growing institutional interest, as the SEC has officially acknowledged a spot XRP ETF filing from Cboe BZX Exchange, submitted on behalf of Bitwise. This marks another step toward regulated XRP investment products, following similar filings from 21Shares and Grayscale. The acknowledgment triggers a 21-day public comment period, after which the SEC must approve, reject, or initiate proceedings for further review. The move comes as the newly formed SEC crypto task force, led by Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce, begins shaping a more defined regulatory framework for digital assets. XRP price and RSI chart from Markus Thielen suggest a potential rally, with RSI near 40% signaling bullish momentum amid SEC uncertainty. Meanwhile, market analysts are closely watching XRP’s momentum. Matrixport analysts highlight XRP’s RSI as hovering near 40%, which is often a signal of an incoming rally. If market conditions align and ETF approvals move forward, traders believe a run toward $5 is within reach, though volatility remains a key factor. Adding to the speculation, recent SEC leadership changes have led to shifts in crypto enforcement priorities. Former SEC Internet Enforcement Director John Reed Stark suggests that the agency may pause or withdraw its Ripple appeal following similar delays in the Coinbase and Binance cases. As regulatory uncertainty eases and institutional interest grows, XRP’s path to $5 hinges on ETF approvals, market sentiment, and legal resolutions—a perfect storm that experts speculate could determine XRP’s next major move. JetBolt Moves Forward with Zero-Gas Technology and Nearly 330 Million Token Sales Blockchain technology has made incredible strides, but high gas fees and slow transactions continue to deter mainstream adoption. JetBolt (JBOLT) seeks to change this by introducing a gas-free, high-speed ecosystem designed to remove financial and technical barriers like gas fees for users and developers alike. Built on the Skale Network, JetBolt eliminates the need for gas fees while ensuring near-instant transactions. Through JetBolt’s Zero-Gas Technology , crypto enthusiasts no longer need to pay gas fees for every blockchain interaction. This frictionless experience benefits not only seasoned crypto traders but also newcomers who would rather prefer a more accessible Web3 experience. Beyond eliminating gas fees, JetBolt utilizes AI technology in novel ways. JetBolt’s AI-powered crypto content aggregator scans and automatically categorizes blockchain news, and Web3 insights based on market sentiment. This high-tech feature can also be accessed through JetBolt’s daily newsletter, providing more accessibility. JetBolt’s ecosystem also features an engagement-based staking mechanism called Proof of Attendance and Worth (PAW) protocol. Unlike traditional staking, PAW rewards active staking users based on their social engagement, staked JBOLT tokens, and daily logins—creating a fun and interactive staking experience. Currently in its presale phase, JetBolt has introduced Alpha Boxes , offering up to 25% extra tokens. With advanced Web3 features and growing momentum, JetBolt aims to redefine how crypto users experience blockchain—focusing on efficiency, accessibility, and innovation. Conclusion: The Road Ahead for XRP and JetBolt Exciting things are unfolding in the crypto market, and two names igniting the discussions: XRP and JetBolt (JBOLT). XRP’s path to $5 is gaining traction with ETF speculation and shifting regulatory tides, while JetBolt is turning heads with its Zero-Gas Technology, AI-driven insights utility, and skyrocketing presale demand. As both altcoins capture market interest, experts are watching closely for their next moves.

Holders of Kusama (KSM) and Axie Infinity (AXS) aren’t just watching from the sidelines—they’re making moves, and all signs point to 1Fuel (OFT) as their next big bet. With analysts buzzing about 100x returns, the race is on to secure a position before the market catches up. If you’re searching for the best crypto to buy now, this might be it. 1Fuel’s presale is heating up, and those who recognize its potential early could be in for a game-changing ride. Why are Kusama Holders Eyeing the Next Big 100x Opportunity? Kusama (KSM) has always been a playground for innovation, but its price action lately has left investors craving more. Despite a 5.31% uptick to $19.50 , it’s still a far cry from its $623.75 all-time high. With volatility keeping traders on edge, many are setting their sights on fresh opportunities—like 1Fuel (OFT), which is being hailed as the best crypto to buy now. The buzz around 1Fuel is hard to ignore, especially with whispers of 100x returns making rounds in investor circles. As Kusama holders look for the next explosive play, 1Fuel’s presale momentum and disruptive tech are proving too tempting to overlook. Axie Infinity (AXS) Holders Are Jumping on a 100x Opportunity Before It’s Too Late Axie Infinity (AXS) has been making headlines with its recent developments and market movements. The team has launched Origins Season 12 , introducing 90,000 AXS in total rewards, a free Jin Avatar, and a new Axie Check-In feature . Additionally, the return of Gauntlet Mode in the Epic Era has players excited. On the market front, AXS is currently trading at $4.28, reflecting a 0.05% increase from the previous close. Despite being 97.5% below its all-time high, analysts are closely monitoring its approach to key resistance levels, suggesting potential breakout opportunities. The Sleeper Token Awakens: Why KSM & AXS Investors Are Piling Into 1Fuel for 100x Gains The crypto world moves fast, but 1Fuel (OFT) is moving faster. With a next-gen peer-to-peer exchange that cuts out the middleman, cross-chain compatibility that actually works, and a presale that’s catching fire, this is shaping up to be one of the best crypto to buy now. Investors aren’t just speculating—they’re diving in headfirst, and for good reason. Over $2.25 million has already poured in, with 214 million tokens snapped up, and the momentum isn’t slowing down. Right now, 1Fuel is priced at just $0.018, but early investors are locking in up to 40% in bonuses before prices surge. And here’s the kicker—anyone throwing in $2,000 or more gets priority access to the beta wallet, an exclusive perk that could prove invaluable once 1Fuel fully launches. With the $3 million target by February 23rd in sight, the clock is ticking. Security? Locked down. Independent smart contract verification ensures that 1Fuel is battle-tested and bulletproof. Cold storage solutions give users full control of their assets. This isn’t another overhyped token—it’s a well-oiled machine built for long-term success. With a booming presale, a loyal community, and one of the strongest utility-driven models in crypto, 1Fuel is making its case loud and clear. Get in Now! This isn’t one of those “wish I had bought earlier” moments—it’s happening right now. Over $2.25 million raised, 214 million tokens gone, and the price is still at just $0.018. Stack up to 40% in bonuses before the door slams shut. The best crypto to buy now? 1Fuel ! The real question is—are you in?

While the market watches this development closely, another interesting project could draw attention – PlutoChain . PlutoChain might tackle one of Bitcoin’s biggest headaches – its speed and cost issues – by building a hybrid Layer-2 solution that could work smoothly with both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Let’s check out the details. Ethereum Price Prediction: New Exchange Application Might Bring Staking to 21Shares Ether ETF – How Will This Impact the Price? The Cboe BZX Exchange has officially filed for SEC approval to allow staking within the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF. If granted, this would be a landmark decision, making it the first U.S.-based ETF to offer staking rewards. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart talked about the significance of this move, as previous ETF applicants—including BlackRock and Fidelity—had removed staking provisions from their filings before receiving SEC approval. Regulatory concerns have surrounded staking for some time, with SEC Chair Gary Gensler previously stating that proof-of-stake assets could fall under securities classification. If approved, this decision could open new opportunities for institutional investors, making Ethereum staking more accessible without the technical complexities of direct participation. Crypto analyst 0din believes that if Ethereum surpasses its previous swing high of $3,700, it could gain momentum and push toward the $4,000 level. Could PlutoChain Expand Bitcoin’s Functionality with Smart Contracts and Advanced Hybrid Layer-2 Technology? PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is developing a Layer-2 solution that could significantly expand Bitcoin’s functionality by enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). While Bitcoin remains the most secure and decentralized blockchain, its 10-minute block time has made it impractical for complex applications, especially when compared to the speed and flexibility of networks like Ethereum and Solana. PlutoChain might address this challenge by offering a faster and more scalable infrastructure while still leveraging Bitcoin’s security and reliability. With a block time of just two seconds, PlutoChain might allow developers to build high-performance dApps that can process thousands of transactions efficiently. Early testnet data shows the network handling over 43,200 transactions per day, signaling that it has the potential to scale for mainstream use. If these performance levels hold, PlutoChain could make Bitcoin a more viable platform for applications beyond simple value transfers. Apart from speed and scalability, PlutoChain also prioritizes decentralization through its governance model. Instead of relying on a central authority to dictate updates, the platform gives users a voice in decision-making. Security is another core focus, with PlutoChain passing audits from well-known firms such as SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi—an important step in building trust and credibility. A key feature that could set PlutoChain apart is its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. This means developers might be able to tap into Ethereum’s massive ecosystem while benefiting from Bitcoin’s security. Such interoperability could unlock new possibilities in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and artificial intelligence (AI), expanding Bitcoin’s role in the blockchain space. Final Words If approved, the introduction of staking in 21Shares’ Ether ETF could mark a major milestone for institutional adoption, potentially driving ETH closer to the $4,000 mark. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could generate buzz as a hybrid Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin. By potentially enabling faster transactions, lower fees, and Ethereum interoperability, it could address Bitcoin’s scalability challenges while bringing new use cases. —— This article is not financial advice.

Sun has made at least $75 million in investments in WLFI, making him one of its most prominent investors. Given previous claims that Tron has been used for illegal financial activities, his involvement has sparked ethical questions. In exchange for WLFI token purchases, WLF has been offering deals that allow cryptocurrency teams to join its portfolio. This strategy has helped the project surpass its initial financial goals, making WLFI one of the most significant token launches in recent history. According to the latest BitMart Research report , as of Feb. 9, WLF has sold $455 million worth of tokens. The project raised $319 million from the sale of 21.3 billion WLFI tokens at a price of $0.015 each. At a price of $0.05 per token, a second round of sales generated an extra $136 million.

However, transparency concerns have emerged over the reported $55 billion in savings. Meanwhile, economic adviser Kevin Hassett confirmed that he is in ongoing discussions with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, though interest rate cuts are still unlikely in the near term. In trade policy, Howard Lutnick was confirmed as Commerce Secretary and is expected to play a key role in Trump’s tariff strategies. His ties to Tether have drawn scrutiny, but he is still very much a vocal supporter of Bitcoin and decentralization. Trump Plans to Return Part of DOGE Savings Donald Trump announced that he is considering a plan to return 20% of the savings generated by Elon Musk’s government cost-cutting initiative, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), to American taxpayers. At a finance and technology summit in Miami hosted by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, Trump explained that another 20% of these savings could be allocated toward paying down the national debt, which is now more than $36 trillion. DOGE claims that it saved approximately $55 billion by canceling government contracts and reducing the federal workforce. However, the accuracy of this figure has been questioned by many, as the department only provided a subset of the over 1,000 canceled contracts and leases it claims to have terminated. Estimated DOGE savings (Source: DOGE ) Concerns about transparency are fueled by inconsistencies in the reported savings. The New York Times recently pointed out that one listed cancellation was originally stated as $8 billion when the actual contract was worth only $8 million . DOGE later clarified in a post on X that it always used the correct $8 million figure in its internal calculations. Elon Musk reportedly pitched Trump on the idea of a tax reduction linked to DOGE’s cost-cutting measures. Based on the reported $55 billion in savings, if this amount were evenly distributed among the 163.1 million individual taxpayers who filed returns last year, each will receive less than $67.50. Additionally, the 20% of DOGE savings allocated to reducing the national debt, which is an estimated $11 billion, will cover just 1.3% of the $839.5 billion budget deficit the government accumulated since the fiscal year began in October. During the same speech, Trump also addressed cryptocurrency policy and mentioned his recent executive order that he claims effectively ended what he described as ”Joe Biden’s war on Bitcoin and crypto.” The order established a crypto working group that is led by White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks. It is tasked with developing a legal framework for digital assets and stablecoins. It also includes an initiative to explore the potential creation of a national crypto stockpile. Trump Adviser Holds Regular Talks with Fed Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council and a key White House adviser to President Trump, revealed that he is holding regular meetings with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. In a recent interview on CBS' Face The Nation, Hassett was asked whether these discussions were aimed at influencing interest rate decisions. He responded by stating that the Federal Reserve is independent, but pointed out that the president's opinions should still be heard. Hassett stated that long-term interest rates have already declined since the Trump administration took office, and specifically pointed to a 40-basis-point drop in 10-year Treasury yields as a sign that the market expects inflation to decrease. Lower interest rates are typically bullish for cryptocurrencies and other risk-sensitive assets, as they provide market participants with easier access to capital, which can be used to invest in digital assets and businesses. Despite Hassett’s comments, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently downplayed the likelihood of immediate rate cuts. While testifying before the Senate Banking Committee on Feb. 11, Powell stated that the Fed does not need to rush into lowering interest rates, which cast serious doubt on the possibility of rate reductions in 2025. The cautious stance from the Fed was reinforced by the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, which showed that annual inflation reached 3% in January of 2025. This was slightly higher than expected. The report led to a market downturn, with Bitcoin falling below $95,000 as investors braced for a prolonged high-interest-rate environment. Rate cut probabilities (Source: Chicago Mercantile Exchange ) Macroeconomic uncertainties, including persistent inflation, the risk of a trade war, and broader economic headwinds, also contributed to growing investor caution around risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s FedWatch tool currently indicates that only 2% of market participants expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its next meeting in March. This means that people are very cautious and skeptical about any potential monetary policy easing in the near term. Howard Lutnick Confirmed as US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was recently confirmed as the 41st US Secretary of Commerce after a 52-45 Senate vote on Feb. 18. Lutnick stepped down as CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald immediately after his confirmation to take on his new role in President Donald Trump’s administration. He is expected to play a big role in shaping US trade policies, particularly in supporting Trump’s push for import taxes on key trading partners. (Source: Congress.gov ) As Commerce Secretary, Lutnick will oversee a department of around 50,000 employees who are tasked with responsibilities ranging from business data collection and patent management to foreign investment promotion and weather forecasting. His influence will also extend to US trade negotiations, where he is set to help implement Trump’s tariff strategy. The administration already imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and increased taxes on foreign steel and aluminum. A 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican imports is also still under consideration, with a final decision expected by early March. During his Senate confirmation hearing, Lutnick dismissed concerns that tariffs will lead to inflation, and called these arguments “nonsense.” Overall, it seems like he is very supportive of Trump’s broader trade policies. Lutnick is a known advocate for cryptocurrency. Cantor Fitzgerald holds a stake in stablecoin issuer Tether and has been one of the company’s most crucial banking partners. Tether’s reserves were valued at $134 billion in November, but have since grown to over $141.7 billion, according to its website. Lutnick pledged to sell off shares in all 818 businesses and private investments he holds within 90 days, and set a deadline of May 19 to complete the divestment. His connections to Tether and the broader crypto industry have drawn a lot of scrutiny , particularly from Senator Elizabeth Warren. She raised concerns about his close ties to the stablecoin giant and the access he will have to top Trump administration officials who are involved in regulating the sector. Despite this, Lutnick openly praised Bitcoin, due to aspects like its halving cycles and decentralized nature. Lutnick’s confirmation fills the vacancy that was left by Gina Raimondo and is the start of a new phase in Trump’s second-term economic agenda.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,DOGE|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-20 05:45:45

This question has been circulating with increasing speculation. A significant development fueling this uncertainty is the reassignment of the SEC’s lead litigator for major cryptocurrency cases. This individual, who played a key role in the Binance and Coinbase cases, was recently moved to the SEC’s IT department. However, Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett t ook to social media and revealed, “On the @SECGov pausing ongoing litigation against #crypto firms — I’m told by multiple legal sources that the SEC has been prioritizing cases with imminent court deadlines, which is one explanation for why we haven’t seen pause requests in the @Ripple and @krakenfx cases.” Meanwhile, the Binance case has been put on hold until April 14, with Lejilex’s case paused until April 11. For Coinbase, the SEC and the firm have agreed to extend the deadline for the agency’s response to Coinbase’s request for an interlocutory appeal until March 14. SEC’s Leadership Transition and Impact on Crypto Cases The pause and extensions align with significant changes within the SEC. Legal experts suggest that these delays could be linked to the expected confirmation of Paul Atkins as the new SEC chair, nominated by President Donald Trump. The leadership change could bring a new approach to how cryptocurrency-related cases are handled, especially as the SEC’s crypto task force continues to assess the regulatory landscape. Regulatory Task Forces Work to Fill Gaps In the meantime, the SEC’s crypto task force, Congress, and the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets are reportedly collaborating to fill the regulatory gaps that contributed to these lawsuits. As the SEC navigates its internal changes and adapts its approach, the industry watches closely to see how these shifts will impact ongoing cases, particularly with Ripple. With Ripple’s court deadline approaching in mid-April, and SEC leadership changes in play, the pause in the case offers an opportunity for the agency to make a more informed decision.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-20 05:53:56

As the broader crypto wallet market expands, Best Wallet is positioning itself as a game-changing alternative to industry giants like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. The global crypto wallet market is on a rapid growth trajectory, projected to expand from $14.39 billion at the end of 2024 to $19.03 billion by the end of 2025 – a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32.2%. Traditionally, well-established wallets like Trust Wallet and MetaMask have dominated the space, but Best Wallet aims to carve out a significant market share by offering innovative features that surpass what these platforms currently provide. Unlike its competitors, Best Wallet is integrating multi-chain support, an in-app decentralized exchange, fiat conversion capabilities, and exclusive benefits tied to the $BEST token. This combination of features sets Best Wallet apart, promising a more robust and versatile experience for users navigating the evolving Web3 landscape. With $BEST priced at $0.02405 during its current presale stage, the price is set to increase per each subsequent round, offering early adopters a low-entry point. Why Best Wallet Stands Out Among Crypto Wallets Best Wallet is designed to address some of the key limitations faced by existing crypto wallets. This non-custodial, multi-chain wallet has also seen rapid adoption, surpassing 250K monthly active users, highlighting its growing presence in the competitive crypto wallet space. 250K+ traders are locking in their edge with Best Wallet. Track new tokens, trade seamlessly, and manage your entire portfolio in one app. The market moves fast, and staying ahead means having the right tools. Download Now! https://t.co/he5kzra7TY pic.twitter.com/AMgOYRzFPf — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) February 3, 2025 Unlike MetaMask, which primarily supports Ethereum and EVM-compatible networks, or Trust Wallet, which has broader multi-chain support but still faces certain ecosystem constraints, Best Wallet extends compatibility to over 60 blockchains. This includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, allowing users to manage diverse portfolios seamlessly without the need for multiple wallets. One of Best Wallet’s most unique features is its integrated decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator. This enables users to perform same-chain and cross-chain token swaps across more than 200 decentralized exchanges, utilizing over 20 cross-chain bridges to secure the best exchange rates with minimal fees. Best Wallet also simplifies fiat conversions, a feature currently missing from MetaMask and Trust Wallet. Users can directly convert crypto to their bank accounts in over 100 fiat currencies within the app, eliminating the need for external exchanges and reducing transaction friction when cashing out. Additional functionalities include iGaming partnerships, allowing users to play with crypto and access exclusive deposit bonuses, as well as the Best Card – a crypto-backed card integrated with Google Pay and Apple Pay that offers up to 8% cashback on every purchase. $BEST Is The Utility Token Powering the Best Wallet Ecosystem While we talked about the core features of Best Wallet above, a key differentiator that sets Best Wallet apart from its competitors is the $BEST token, which offers exclusive benefits to users and adds a new dimension of utility beyond simple asset storage. Its primary function is to provide financial and strategic incentives to holders, making transactions within the wallet more cost-effective and granting exclusive access to premium features. Holding $BEST will allow users to reduce transaction and swap fees, an attractive proposition for those frequently moving assets across different blockchains. Additionally, $BEST will play a governance role, allowing holders to participate in community-driven voting processes that shape the future development of the Best Wallet ecosystem. This decentralized model will foster transparency and ensure that the platform evolves in alignment with user needs. Another unique benefit of $BEST is its ‘Upcoming Tokens’ feature. This enables holders to gain early access to presales before new tokens hit the broader market, giving them a potential edge in acquiring assets at lower valuations. These integrated utilities position $BEST as a valuable token with tangible use cases, distinguishing it from other wallet-based tokens and reinforcing Best Wallet’s growing appeal. Crypto Analysts Show Strong Interest in Best Wallet Best Wallet’s rapid adoption has not gone unnoticed, with analysts and crypto influencers highlighting its potential to disrupt the current landscape. Prominent YouTuber ClayBro, known for his in-depth crypto analysis, recently expressed strong optimism about Best Wallet’s ecosystem and its native token. New Statistics Show This Crypto Wallet Could Bring In A Lot Of Value! In a recent video, ClayBro emphasized how Best Wallet is far more than just another crypto wallet, pointing out its extensive utility-driven features. Moreover, stating that the $BEST presale has raised more than $200,000 in the last 48 hours, ClayBro notes that this token could be a standout contender in the crypto wallet space. ClayBro also touched on the staking rewards available within the Best Wallet ecosystem. Currently, users can stake $BEST to earn a significant 160% APY (annual percentage yield). With over 165 million tokens already staked, the program has contributed to reducing circulating supply, which could help sustain long-term price stability. How to Join the $BEST Presale? With the Best Wallet presale raising over $10.2 million, momentum continues to build around the project. Currently priced at $0.02405 per token, $BEST presents an opportunity for investors looking to gain early exposure to a growing ecosystem before its price increases in upcoming presale rounds. Users can participate in the $BEST directly through the Best Wallet app , which is available on Google Play and the Apple App Store . Alternatively, tokens can be acquired directly from the Best Wallet Token presale website using various payment methods, including Ethereum ($ETH), Binance Coin ($BNB), Tether ($USDT), Dogecoin ($DOGE). Credit Card options are also supported. As Best Wallet continues to refine its offerings and roll out new features, it remains one of the most intriguing crypto projects of 2025. With an expanding ecosystem, integrated utilities, and a native token that provides real benefits, Best Wallet is carving out a distinct space in the competitive world of crypto wallets.

In Nigeria, the government has filed an $81.5 billion lawsuit against Binance, alleging tax evasion and economic damages linked to the devaluation of the naira. Meanwhile, in the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly prioritizing delays in certain crypto enforcement cases as the regulatory landscape shifts under President Donald Trump’s administration. Nigeria Files $81.5 Billion Lawsuit Against Binance Over Tax Evasion and Currency Devaluation The Nigerian government has filed an $81.5 billion lawsuit against Binance , the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, accusing the platform of tax evasion and destabilizing Nigeria’s local currency. The lawsuit, which includes $2 billion in alleged unpaid taxes and $79 billion in economic damages, is the latest escalation in the country’s crackdown on cryptocurrency trading. According to a report by Reuters , Nigeria’s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) contends that Binance has a “significant economic presence” in the country and failed to pay the required taxes in 2022 and 2023. The agency is also demanding a 26.75% interest payment on the allegedly unpaid taxes and holds Binance accountable for the sharp decline in the Nigerian naira’s value against foreign currencies. The lawsuit represents the culmination of months of tensions between Nigerian authorities and Binance, which escalated last year when the government detained two Binance executives—Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla—on charges of tax fraud and money laundering. While those charges were later dropped, Nigeria’s legal pursuit of Binance has intensified, leading to one of the largest financial lawsuits in the country’s history. Nigeria has taken an increasingly hardline stance against cryptocurrency trading, particularly as the government grapples with inflation and currency devaluation. The central bank and regulatory agencies have repeatedly expressed concerns that cryptocurrency platforms facilitate capital flight and illicit financial activities, exacerbating the naira’s depreciation. Binance had already faced heightened scrutiny from Nigerian authorities before this lawsuit. In February 2024, Gambaryan and Anjarwalla were detained following what was supposed to be a routine meeting with regulators. Shortly afterward, in March 2024, Binance suspended naira transactions on its platform amid mounting pressure from Nigerian officials, who claimed that traders were using the exchange to manipulate forex rates and devalue the national currency. The exchange's decision to halt naira trading was a direct response to Nigeria’s increasing hostility toward digital asset platforms, which the government believes undermine its monetary policies. Diplomatic Pressure and Executive’s Detention The arrest and prolonged detention of Binance’s former Head of Financial Crime Compliance, Tigran Gambaryan, drew international backlash, particularly from the United States. Gambaryan, a US citizen, was reportedly suffering from chronic health conditions while imprisoned but was allegedly denied adequate medical care. His detention gained widespread media attention, with calls for his release from US officials and human rights organizations. In July 2024, US Representative Rich McCormick introduced a resolution labeling Gambaryan’s detention as a hostage situation and demanding his immediate release. The diplomatic pressure escalated further in September 2024 when US Ambassador to Nigeria, Richard Mills, called for Gambaryan’s freedom. Facing mounting international scrutiny, Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) withdrew the money laundering charges against Gambaryan in October 2024. Following nearly seven months behind bars, he was released and departed Nigeria on Oct. 23, 2024. The Nigerian government’s actions against Binance signal a broader effort to tighten regulations around cryptocurrency trading in the country. Nigeria, which has one of the largest crypto user bases in Africa, has been navigating the fine line between embracing digital assets and imposing stringent regulatory measures to control their impact on the national economy. The lawsuit against Binance could set a precedent for how Nigeria and other emerging markets approach the regulation of global cryptocurrency exchanges. If successful, the case could pave the way for similar legal actions against other exchanges operating in the country without full compliance with local tax laws and financial regulations. While Binance has yet to publicly respond to the lawsuit, the company has historically maintained that it adheres to regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where it operates. However, its battle with Nigerian authorities is far from over, and the outcome of this high-stakes legal clash could reshape the crypto landscape in Africa’s largest economy. Nigeria’s $81.5 billion lawsuit against Binance represents a critical moment in the ongoing tension between cryptocurrency exchanges and national governments seeking to enforce financial regulations. While the Nigerian government’s accusations of tax evasion and currency destabilization are serious, the case also raises questions about regulatory clarity, international diplomacy, and the future of crypto trading in the country. As the legal proceedings unfold, the outcome could have far-reaching consequences for both Binance and the broader cryptocurrency industry in Nigeria and beyond. SEC Reportedly Prioritizing Pausing Crypto Enforcement Cases Amid Regulatory Shift In other news, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly focusing on delaying cryptocurrency enforcement cases with imminent deadlines, which explains why its lawsuits against major crypto firms like Ripple and Kraken have yet to be put on hold. According to Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, the regulator’s actions may be influenced by ongoing political shifts and the potential appointment of a new SEC chair under President Donald Trump. Terrett, citing multiple unnamed sources, revealed in a Feb. 19 post on X that the SEC is prioritizing cases with more urgent legal deadlines. Ripple, the blockchain company behind the XRP Ledger, has its next court deadline on April 16, while Kraken, the cryptocurrency exchange, faces a March 31 deadline. Meanwhile, other major crypto platforms like Coinbase and Binance have deadlines on March 14 and April 14, respectively. According to Terrett, the SEC’s leadership might be expecting Paul Atkins, Trump’s nominee for SEC chair, to be confirmed by that time. She also suggested that in the meantime, several regulatory bodies, including the SEC’s crypto task force, Congress, and the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets, are working to address the regulatory inconsistencies that led to the SEC’s aggressive approach toward crypto firms. Under former President Joe Biden, the SEC, alongside the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), pursued over 100 lawsuits against crypto companies for alleged violations of securities laws. In 2023 alone, the SEC sued Kraken, accusing the exchange of operating as an unregistered securities broker. The agency also filed a lawsuit against Coinbase, alleging that it had failed to register as a broker, national securities exchange, or clearing agency, thereby evading the disclosure requirements of the securities market. Additionally, both Kraken and Coinbase faced SEC action for offering crypto staking services, a practice the regulator claimed fell under unregistered securities offerings. Meanwhile, Ripple has been embroiled in a legal battle with the SEC since 2020, with the regulator accusing the company of selling unregistered securities through its XRP token. Shifting Regulatory Priorities Under Trump In stark contrast to Biden’s administration, President Donald Trump has signaled a more industry-friendly stance on cryptocurrency regulation. Trump has pledged to reduce enforcement actions against crypto firms and position the US as a global leader in the digital asset space. His nomination of Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner known for his pro-business stance, signals this shift in regulatory priorities. This changing regulatory environment is already having tangible effects. Just ten days after Trump’s second presidential term began, Kraken resumed its staking services for US clients, marking the first time in nearly two years that the exchange was able to offer staking products without regulatory interference. If the SEC continues pausing or scaling back enforcement cases, the broader crypto industry may witness a more favorable regulatory environment in the coming months. Market participants are closely watching the confirmation process for Paul Atkins, as his leadership at the SEC could signal a significant departure from the stringent policies of the previous administration. Moreover, Congress and other regulatory bodies are expected to take a more active role in shaping a comprehensive framework for crypto regulation, potentially reducing the ad-hoc enforcement approach that has characterized the SEC’s actions in recent years. As the legal landscape evolves, crypto firms operating in the US will need to stay informed about shifting policies and potential new compliance requirements. The coming months could be pivotal in determining the long-term trajectory of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BNB|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-20 06:00:00

The ‘D.O.G.E Dividend’, named after Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), will return 20% of the savings from Musk’s cost-cutting initiative directly to taxpayers. Trump confirmed the plan during a Miami Beach event on Wednesday, speaking to a nonprofit backed by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. “There’s even under consideration a new concept where we give 20% of the D.O.G.E savings to American citizens and 20% goes to paying down debt,” Trump said . “The numbers are incredible, Elon, so many billions—hundreds of billions—and we’re thinking about giving 20% back to the American citizens.” The announcement came just a day after Musk tweeted that he would “check with the President” in response to investor James Fishback, who has been advocating for the refund. Fishback has been pushing for a direct payout to taxpayers, arguing that D.O.G.E has saved enough to make it happen. Musk’s D.O.G.E fires thousands, claims billions in savings D.O.G.E has been aggressively cutting government spending, but not without controversy. The agency made bold claims about its success, saying it exposed fraud and slashed billions in waste, but some of those numbers haven’t held up under scrutiny. Two of the most talked-about claims—a supposed Social Security fraud crackdown and an $8 billion savings in a Department of Homeland Security contract—turned out to be false. Thousands of federal workers were fired last week under the initiative too, and now the government could be on the hook for unemployment benefits. According to Labor Department data, most of those fired employees qualify for up to $400 a week for 26 weeks. The exact financial toll is still unclear, but estimates say it could cost the government millions. How much money will taxpayers actually get? While the White House claims D.O.G.E has saved $55 billion, independent reviews don’t support that figure. Documents posted by the initiative on X show savings closer to $8.6 billion, which means the 20% dividend payout would be about $11 per taxpayer—a far cry from what many expected. Despite that, Trump insists the plan is a long-term win. He pointed to the 75,000 federal workers who took voluntary buyouts as proof that D.O.G.E is cutting costs effectively. “This is a necessary change,” he told the audience in Miami Beach. “The United States is back and open for business.” The speech was delivered to a crowd of business elites, including Vista Equity’s Robert Smith, 26North Partners’ Josh Harris, WeWork founder Adam Neumann, and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. Trump pitched his vision for economic recovery, emphasizing aggressive government downsizing and regulatory cuts. Fishback, who originally proposed the D.O.G.E Dividend, argues that the initiative could save $2 trillion over two years, which would mean roughly $25,000 per taxpayer. Under Trump’s 20% refund plan, that would equal $5,000 per taxpayer—a major payout compared to current estimates. However, Musk clarified on Twitter that no final amount has been decided. “Haven’t endorsed a specific amount,” he wrote Wednesday, adding that the refund may come in the form of a lower tax bill rather than direct cash payments. On Friday, D.O.G.E announced it had discovered an additional $1.9 billion in misplaced Department of Housing and Urban Development funds. The agency also canceled $373 million in Education Department grants earmarked for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) training. Another $900 million in academic tracking grants was scrapped last week, as D.O.G.E stretched its focus to target Pentagon spending. Musk has hinted that the military’s discretionary budget—a massive, often unchecked expense—is next on the chopping block.

After weeks of speculation about his potential entry into the memecoin market, Cuban said he has no plans to launch his own token at this time. “A lot needs to change in terms of transparency and, more importantly, fairness,” Cuban said. “I don’t want to be involved in the game of shoehorning.” Cuban’s decision comes after a major controversy involving Argentine President Javier Milei and a memecoin called Libra. Marketed as a project aimed at funding small Argentine businesses and startups, the token quickly reached a market value of $4.5 billion before crashing within hours. The project collapsed after the team behind the token executed a rugpull transaction, leading to major financial losses for investors. Related News: BREAKING : Coinbase Adds Unexpected Altcoin to Its Roadmap to List Hayden Davis, Milei’s alleged memecoin advisor, later admitted in interviews that he personally withdrew $100 million from the project and now has funds he’s unsure how to handle. The scandal, dubbed “Cryptogate” in Argentina, has led to accusations of fraud against Milei and calls for his removal. Prior to the Libra debate, Cuban had expressed tentative optimism about the potential of memecoins despite their speculative nature. He proposed launching a coin with the same tokenomics as former US President Donald Trump’s TRUMP token, but with a unique twist that would direct all proceeds toward reducing the US national debt. *This is not investment advice.

Introduced by Representative Curtis Schomer, House Bill 429 first landed in the House on Feb. 7 and has now cleared its first major hurdle with a 12-8 committee vote on Feb. 19. Despite unified opposition from Democrats, the bill secured enough support from Republicans to move forward. Now, the bill heads to the full Montana House for a vote. If it passes there, it will move to the state Senate for further debate and approval. From there, it would need the governor’s signature to become law. If passed, Montana would establish a state special revenue account dedicated to investing in digital assets, precious metals, and stablecoins as part of a broader reserve strategy. The bill authorizes the state treasurer to transfer up to $50 million from the general fund into this account by July 15, 2025. These funds would be managed by the Montana Board of Investments and allocated to assets deemed suitable under the bill’s criteria. You might also like: Montana passes ‘right to mine’ proposal The bill defines digital assets as virtual currencies, cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and other blockchain-based assets with economic or proprietary rights. However, to qualify for investment, a digital asset must have a market capitalization exceeding $750 billion, averaged over the previous calendar year—a requirement that currently only Bitcoin meets. An amendment to the bill removed a prior requirement that the assets must be held by a qualified custodian or through an exchange-traded fund. This change broadens how the state can manage its investments, allowing for more direct holding of assets. Montana joins a growing list of U.S. states exploring Bitcoin reserves, with Illinois , New Mexico, North Dakota , Ohio , Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Texas , among others, also introducing similar bills. So far, Utah remains the only state where a Bitcoin reserve bill has cleared the House. According to Denis Porter, CEO of the Satoshi Act Fund, Utah could become the first U.S. state to establish a Bitcoin reserve due to its short legislative calendar. On the contrary, the odds that a Bitcoin reserve will be established at a national level appear to be fading . A Polymarket poll with over $7 million in assets placed the chances of Donald Trump creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve within his first 100 days at just 10%, down significantly from 40% in January.

Speaking at the FII PRIORITY Summit in Miami Beach, Trump said he was determined to make “America the crypto capital.” The War Against Bitcoin Is Over! Trump stated that the hostility towards Bitcoin and other digital assets adopted by the Biden administration has ended and said that he will work to make the US a leader in the field of artificial intelligence and crypto. Stating that he signed executive orders for this, Trump said, “I have signed executive orders to keep the US at the forefront of AI and to completely end the Biden administration's war on Bitcoin and crypto. This war is over now. Bitcoin broke multiple records because everyone knew I was determined to make America the crypto capital.” I'm Doing the Right Thing! Trump also criticized the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies, stating that many investigations were carried out with political motives. Stating that the SEC's harsh stance against the cryptocurrency industry had begun to change before the elections, Trump claimed that he had an influence on this. Stating that he did not act for political purposes, Trump continued his words as follows: “I don't do anything for political reasons, I do what is right. I want the US to be a leader in every field, and crypto is one of them.

According to blockchain research firm Nansen, out of 15,430 wallets that traded the token for a profit or loss exceeding $1,000, a shocking 86% sold at a loss. Retail Traders Take the Biggest Hit in LIBRA Collapse Meanwhile, only 2,101 wallets managed to exit with realized profits, collectively pocketing just $180 million—a fraction compared to the total losses. Analysts noted that the biggest winners appeared to be insiders who cashed out early, while unsuspecting retail investors were left bearing the brunt of the crash. Nansen’s Feb. 19 report shed light on the distribution of losses, with 1,478 wallets losing between $1,000 and $10,000, totaling $4.8 million in damages. More than 2,800 wallets saw losses between $10,000 and $100,000, adding up to a massive $82.4 million. Meanwhile, 392 wallets suffered losses between $100,000 and $1 million, and 23 wallets lost over $1 million each, with combined losses amounting to $40.9 million. Among the biggest losers was Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, whose wallet registered a steepest realized loss of $6.3 million. Portnoy, who had initially received 6 million LIBRA tokens as payment for promoting the project, later returned them, claiming he wanted no involvement in the scandal. Legal Battles and Political Fallout As the dust settles, the fallout from the LIBRA debacle is far from over. Burwick Law, the firm leading lawsuits against Pump.fun and Hawk Tuah (HAWK) memecoin creators, has already begun gathering hundreds of claims from affected investors and is considering legal action. “Our priority is advocating for those affected and helping them explore potential avenues for financial recovery,” the law firm stated on Feb. 17. The key figures behind the LIBRA launch—Kelsier Ventures CEO Hayden Davis and KIP Protocol CEO Julian Peh—have come under intense scrutiny. Davis, who was allegedly one of the biggest beneficiaries, has denied directly owning or selling any LIBRA tokens, despite claims that he and his firm profited around $100 million from the token’s launch. Meanwhile, Argentine President Javier Milei, whose brief endorsement of LIBRA on X helped trigger the pump, has attempted to distance himself from the controversy. While he insists he did not “promote” the LIBRA token , legal troubles are mounting, with fraud lawsuits naming him as a defendant. Local media outlet La Nacion has even reported that Milei’s sister, Karina Milei, may have been involved in behind-the-scenes dealings with Davis, though Davis has denied sending messages linking her to the project.

40575336,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131869,1740036188,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,USD/INR Alert: Will RBI Intervention Steady Rupee Amid Global Forex Tremors?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/usd-inr-rbi-forex-markets/,"In today’s fast-paced cryptocurrency and global finance landscape, understanding traditional currency pairs like USD/INR remains crucial. Even in the crypto realm, fluctuations in fiat currencies can indirectly impact digital asset valuations and trading strategies. Currently, the USD/INR pair is holding its ground, but what’s driving this steadiness, and what could trigger the next big move? Let’s decode the factors at play. USD/INR Remains Steady: What’s Behind the Current Stability? The Indian Rupee (INR) is showing resilience in Thursday’s Asian trading session, maintaining a flat line against the US Dollar (USD). Several factors are contributing to this equilibrium, even as undercurrents of uncertainty persist. While concerns like potential Trump tariffs and continuous outflows from Indian stocks are applying downward pressure on the INR, there are counterbalancing forces at work. Let’s break down the key elements: Global Economic Uncertainty: The broader global economic outlook is clouded with uncertainties. This environment often leads to a ‘wait-and-see’ approach from investors, resulting in less aggressive trading and potentially contributing to the USD/INR pair’s current stability. RBI’s Potential Role: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is a significant player in the forex market. Market participants anticipate potential intervention from the RBI to prevent excessive Rupee depreciation, which can act as a psychological support level for the INR. Crude Oil Prices: India is a major crude oil importer. A decrease in crude oil prices can ease pressure on India’s import bill, reducing the demand for US Dollars and thus supporting the Indian Rupee. Trump Tariffs and FPI Outflows: Why Are These Factors Weighing on the Indian Rupee? Despite the current stability, the Indian Rupee faces significant headwinds. Two major concerns are casting a shadow over the INR’s prospects: Trump’s Tariff Threats: The resurgence of trade protectionist rhetoric, particularly from former US President Trump regarding potential tariffs, injects uncertainty into global trade. Such policies can negatively impact emerging market currencies like the INR, as they can disrupt trade flows and investor sentiment. Persistent FPI Outflows: Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have been net sellers of Indian equities, withdrawing over $10 billion in the first six weeks of 2025. This marks the largest outflow in over a decade for this period, signaling a bearish sentiment towards Indian equities. These outflows directly reduce the demand for INR, putting downward pressure on its value. This combination of trade worries and capital flight creates a challenging environment for the Indian Rupee, limiting its potential for significant appreciation against the US Dollar. RBI Intervention and Crude Oil: Can These Factors Limit INR’s Downside? While headwinds exist, the Indian Rupee isn’t without its defenses. Two key factors could act as buffers against sharp depreciation: RBI Intervention: The RBI possesses substantial foreign exchange reserves, although they have decreased by over $75 billion since September 2024. The central bank can intervene in the forex market by selling USD and buying INR to support the Rupee. The anticipation of such intervention can deter aggressive short-selling of the INR. Lower Crude Oil Prices: As a major oil importer, India benefits from lower crude oil prices. A decline in oil prices reduces India’s import costs, lessening the demand for US Dollars to pay for oil imports. This, in turn, can alleviate pressure on the Indian Rupee and provide some support. These factors suggest that while the INR may face downward pressure, aggressive depreciation might be contained by proactive measures and favorable external factors. Decoding Economic Data and Fed Speak: What’s Next for USD/INR? Looking ahead, traders are closely watching key economic indicators and statements from US Federal Reserve (Fed) officials. These events could provide fresh catalysts for movement in the USD/INR pair. Here’s what to monitor: US Economic Data Releases: Today’s US economic calendar includes crucial releases such as weekly Initial Jobless Claims, the CB Leading Economic Index, and the Philly Fed Manufacturing Index. Stronger-than-expected data could bolster the US Dollar, while weaker figures might weigh on it. Fed Speakers: Speeches from Fed officials Austan Goolsbee, Michael Barr, and Alberto Musalem are scheduled for today. Their commentary on the US economy, inflation, and the future path of interest rates could significantly impact the USD and, consequently, the USD/INR pair. Any hawkish signals, suggesting a slower pace of rate cuts, could strengthen the USD. FOMC Minutes Analysis: The recently released minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting indicated a cautious approach from policymakers. They emphasized the need for clear signs of slowing inflation before considering further rate cuts. This reinforces the message that the Fed is in no rush to ease monetary policy, which can be USD-positive. Indian Rupee’s Sideways Trading: A Sign of Consolidation or Impending Volatility? The Indian Rupee’s current sideways trading pattern reflects a period of consolidation amidst heightened global market volatility. While the INR is not making significant moves, the underlying pressures and potential triggers suggest that this calm might be temporary. The global economic landscape remains fluid, and shifts in investor sentiment or unexpected economic news could quickly inject volatility into the USD/INR pair. The sharp decline in RBI’s foreign exchange reserves and the Rupee’s depreciation earlier in February to nearly 88 against the USD highlight the potential for rapid movements. Economic growth figures also play a role. India’s GDP growth is projected to moderate, which could have implications for investor confidence and currency valuations. USD/INR Technical Outlook: Bullish Vibe Persists Despite Consolidation From a technical perspective, the USD/INR pair maintains a bullish outlook despite the recent consolidation. Analyzing the charts reveals: Bullish Trend: The USD/INR pair is trading above the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily chart, indicating a prevailing bullish trend. RSI Indicator: The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is above the midline, suggesting continued buying momentum in the near term. Key Resistance Levels: The immediate upside target is the psychological level of 87.00. 突破 above this level could pave the way for a rally towards the all-time high near 88.00, and potentially extend towards 88.50. Key Support Levels: On the downside, immediate support lies at 86.58, followed by 86.35 and 86.14. Breaching these levels could signal a shift in momentum. Traders should closely monitor these technical levels in conjunction with fundamental developments to anticipate potential USD/INR movements. Frequently Asked Questions: Understanding the Indian Rupee’s Dynamics How does the Indian economy impact the Indian Rupee? A robust Indian economy generally strengthens the Indian Rupee. India’s strong growth rate attracts foreign investment, both direct and indirect. Increased investment boosts demand for the INR. Conversely, economic slowdowns can weaken the Rupee. What is the impact of Oil prices on the Rupee? As a major oil importer, India is highly sensitive to oil price fluctuations. Higher oil prices increase India’s import bill, leading to greater demand for US Dollars to pay for oil, which depreciates the Rupee. Lower oil prices have the opposite effect, supporting the INR. How does inflation in India impact the Rupee? Inflation’s impact is complex. High inflation can erode the Rupee’s value. However, if inflation rises above the RBI’s target, the RBI may raise interest rates. Higher interest rates can attract foreign investment, strengthening the Rupee. Conversely, lower inflation might lead to lower interest rates, potentially weakening the INR. How does seasonal US Dollar demand from importers and banks impact the Rupee? India’s trade deficit means imports often exceed exports. International trade is largely USD-denominated. Seasonal or surge in import demand increases USD demand, requiring Indian importers to sell INR to buy USD, weakening the Rupee. Increased market volatility can also trigger a rush for USD, similarly impacting the INR negatively. Conclusion: Navigating USD/INR in Uncertain Forex Markets The USD/INR pair is currently in a state of equilibrium, balancing global uncertainties with potential RBI intervention and fluctuating crude oil prices. While factors like Trump’s tariff threats and FPI outflows exert downward pressure on the Indian Rupee, RBI actions and lower oil prices could provide crucial support. Traders should remain vigilant, monitoring economic data releases, Fed statements, and technical indicators to anticipate the next directional move in this important currency pair. Understanding these dynamics is key for anyone involved in forex trading or seeking to navigate the complexities of global currency markets, including those in the cryptocurrency space who are indirectly affected by fiat currency movements.

The researcher took a deep dive into US Securities and Exchange Commission 13F filings, which are forms that large investment firms submit quarterly to disclose their holdings of stocks and equity-related assets. The institutions included banks, hedge funds , registered investment advisors, family offices, endowments, pensions, sovereign wealth funds, and other asset managers, he noted. I dug through the 13F filings and, by my count, there were 1,573 institutions with long exposure to Bitcoin in Q4 2024. These include banks, hedge funds, RIAs, family offices, endowments, pensions, sovereign wealth funds, & other asset managers. Below are some major findings — Sam Callahan (@samcallah) February 19, 2025 Early Stage Institutional Interest However, he noted that these 13F filings only contain a firm’s long positions in US equity-related assets. They exclude assets such as bonds, real estate, commodities, venture capital, futures, cash, and spot Bitcoin ETFs, so they only provide an “incomplete picture” of a firm’s total portfolio. However, the median Bitcoin position across institutions was just 0.13%, indicating that adoption was still in very early stages. Some notable firms with significant Bitcoin allocations include Horizon Kinetics, with $1.3 billion exposure or 16%, Bracebridge Capital has $334 million exposure or around 24%, Tudor Investment Corp as $436 million, 1.6% while Brevan Howard has 8.7%, equating to $1.4 billion in Bitcoin. Large quant and market-making firms such as Millennium, Jane Street, and Citadel hold Bitcoin ETFs, but primarily for arbitrage, not for long-term investment, he noted. Meanwhile, banks like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have small Bitcoin ETF holdings, mainly for market-making purposes, due to current regulatory restrictions. Overall, Bitcoin is gaining traction as an institutional asset, but its adoption is still in its early stages. Only 19% of the 8,190 13F filings last quarter reported BTC exposure. “Institutional investors managing trillions of dollars are still just dipping their toes in this market,” he said before concluding: “As more enter the fray—or those already in increase their allocations—the inflows could drive Bitcoin to new heights and change its investor base forever.” SEC Filings at ATH On Feb. 19, Alphractal founder and CEO Joao Wedson observed that SEC filings mentioning the top two crypto assets are at record levels. “A major movement in crypto is coming as SEC filings mentioning ‘Bitcoin’ and ‘Ethereum’ have hit an all-time high!

Welcome back to Bitcoin World’s AI deep dive! This week, we’re tackling a burning question in the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence: are AI benchmarks really telling us anything meaningful? Elon Musk’s xAI just dropped its latest model, Grok 3, boasting impressive scores. But before we get swept away by the numbers, let’s pause and consider if these metrics are truly reflecting real-world AI performance or just creating hype. Because in the crypto world, just like in AI, it’s crucial to look beyond the surface and understand the real value proposition. The Glaring Problem with Current AI Benchmarks It’s hard to avoid the buzz around new AI models crushing benchmarks. This week, Grok 3 entered the arena, claiming to outperform models from OpenAI and others in math, coding, and more. These benchmarks are often presented as definitive proof of progress. But are they? Think of it like this: are standardized tests the best measure of real-world intelligence? Often, these AI benchmarks focus on niche knowledge and generate aggregate scores that don’t really translate to how well an AI performs in tasks that actually matter to most users. Here’s the crux of the issue: Esoteric Focus: Many benchmarks test for very specific, sometimes obscure knowledge domains that aren’t relevant to everyday AI applications. Poor Real-World Correlation: High scores on benchmarks don’t always mean the AI is actually better at tasks you’d use it for daily. Self-Reporting Bias: Alarmingly, AI companies often self-report these benchmark results, raising questions about objectivity and potential inflation of scores. As Wharton professor Ethan Mollick astutely pointed out, the current state of AI testing is, frankly, ‘meh’ and ‘saturated.’ He argues for an “urgent need for better batteries of tests and independent AI testing authorities.” Without rigorous, independent evaluation, we’re essentially relying on ‘taste tests’ for technology that’s becoming increasingly critical to our work and lives. If AI is truly going to revolutionize industries, including crypto and blockchain, we need more robust and reliable ways to measure its capabilities. The Debate Rages: Beyond Traditional AI Benchmarks The shortcomings of current AI benchmarks are not a secret. A lively debate is brewing about how we should actually evaluate AI progress. Should we even be paying attention to these numbers right now? Some experts suggest aligning benchmarks with tangible economic impact . This would mean focusing on how AI contributes to real-world productivity, innovation, and economic growth. Others champion adoption and utility as the ultimate benchmarks. In this view, the true measure of an AI model’s success is how widely it’s adopted and how useful it proves to be for users in practical scenarios. This divergence in perspectives highlights a fundamental challenge: what do we truly want to measure when we assess AI? Is it esoteric knowledge, or is it practical problem-solving ability? Is it benchmark scores, or is it real-world value creation? The answer likely lies in a combination of factors, but the current over-reliance on easily gamed and potentially misleading benchmarks is clearly not sufficient. Time to Tune Out the Noise? Ignoring AI Benchmark Hype Perhaps, as X user Roon suggests, the sanest approach for now is to simply pay less attention to the constant barrage of new AI models and their benchmark scores. Unless we see major, truly groundbreaking technical breakthroughs, the incremental improvements touted by current benchmarks might be more noise than signal. For our collective sanity, especially in the already fast-paced crypto and tech worlds, stepping back from the daily benchmark race might be a wise move. Yes, there might be a twinge of AI FOMO, but focusing on real-world applications and tangible progress might be far more productive in the long run. As a reminder, This Week in AI is taking a brief hiatus. Thank you for joining us on this exciting journey! We’ll be back to navigate the ever-evolving AI landscape soon. AI News Highlights: Quick Bites OpenAI’s ‘Uncensoring’ Act: OpenAI is shifting its development philosophy to embrace ‘intellectual freedom,’ aiming to tackle even controversial topics with ChatGPT. Mira’s New Venture: Former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati’s startup, Thinking Machines Lab, is focused on creating AI tools tailored to individual user needs and goals.

Europe’s AI Sovereignty Push: OpenEuroLLM, a collaborative effort, aims to develop transparent foundation models for AI in Europe, preserving linguistic and cultural diversity within the EU. Research Spotlight: SWE-Lancer Benchmark OpenAI researchers have introduced SWE-Lancer, a new AI benchmark designed to evaluate coding proficiency. It features over 1,400 freelance software engineering tasks, ranging from bug fixes to complex technical proposals. Intriguingly, even top models like Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet only achieve a 40.3% score, indicating significant room for improvement in AI coding capabilities. It’s noteworthy that newer models from OpenAI and DeepSeek were not included in this benchmark. Model of the Week: Step-Audio Chinese AI startup Stepfun has unveiled Step-Audio, an ‘open’ AI model capable of understanding and generating speech in multiple languages (Chinese, English, and Japanese). Users can customize the emotion and dialect of the synthesized audio, even including singing. Stepfun is part of a wave of well-funded Chinese AI startups releasing models under open licenses, reflecting a dynamic and competitive global AI landscape. Grab Bag of AI Insights DeepHermes-3 Preview: Nous Research has launched DeepHermes-3 Preview, an AI model that combines reasoning and intuitive language capabilities. It can toggle ‘chains of thought’ for enhanced accuracy, offering a glimpse into more sophisticated AI architectures.

The numbers are off the chart: $23.2m raised so far and over 24,000 holders. The macro-environment couldn’t be more hospitable to AI crypto projects. And with just 6 days left in its presale, iDEGEN has investors wondering: could this be the next 100x gem in a sector that produces them by the dozen? iDEGEN: Not here to take part. Here to take over. iDEGEN is making other crypto projects look dull and tired. This uncensored AI agent has been trained entirely by the degen community on X and has been causing chaos since its inception. While other dry AI models play it safe, iDEGEN pulls no punches, mirroring the wild and unfiltered world of crypto Twitter. Price increases for early investors have been astonishing, turning modest investments into life-changing sums, with over $23.2m raised so far. iDEGEN’s bullish evolution iDEGEN’s changes have set it apart from the competition. Its V2 update expanded its reach to Telegram and enabled autonomous interactions with trending hashtags and top crypto accounts. The V3 upgrade took things even further, introducing video content creation and positively turbocharging its virality. But perhaps the most exciting development is iDEGEN’s integration with DeepSeek, the viral Chinese AI model that’s been making waves in the tech world. As the first AI agent to utilize DeepSeek, iDEGEN is positioning itself at the forefront of the US-China AI race, potentially opening up new markets and opportunities for growth.

This could be the start of life-changing gains As the crypto community counts down the final 7 days to iDEGEN’s listing, the question remains: could this wild AI crypto really 100x? One thing is certain: AI crypto is the major narrative in this cycle. We’ve had the ICO boom; we’ve had DeFi summer.

House Bill No. 429 was passed by the state’s Business and Labor Committee yesterday in a 12-8 vote, making Montana the fourth US state to advance a Bitcoin reserve bill to the House. All Republicans voted in favor of the new Bitcoin bill, while all Democrats opposed the idea. Bitcoin is the only crypto that meets the new bill’s requirements After passing through the subcommittee level, the proposed bill will now head to Montana’s House. The only other states that have advanced a Bitcoin reserve bill to this stage are Arizona, Utah, and Oklahoma. If the new bill is approved, it will allow for the creation of a special revenue account that will invest in precious metals, stablecoins, and cryptocurrencies. However, one requirement for the cryptos that the account can invest in is that the digital asset has an averaged market cap of more than $750 billion over the last calendar year. This means that Bitcoin is the only crypto eligible so far. Other cryptos could make their way into the fund in coming years, with the pro-crypto Donald Trump administration expected to ignite the next rally in the digital asset market. As things stand, leading altcoin Ethereum (ETH) might be the next digital asset to make its way into Montana’s strategic reserve fund. CoinMarketCap data shows that ETH currently has a market of over $329.52 billion. This means that its capitalization will have to more than double before the altcoin has a chance of inclusion. Notably, the bill was amended to exclude the requirement that the reserve’s funds must be held by a qualified custodian or through a registered exchange-traded fund (ETF). Should the new bill receive the greenlight, it would come effective on July 1 this year. Montana’s state treasurer could then transfer up to $50 million to a special account that will be used to acquire the precious metals, cryptos and stablecoins that will be held in the strategic reserve by July 15. Several other US states file for Bitcoin reserve, Utah leads Several other US states, including Illinois, Kentucky, Utah, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Texas are also pushing for a Bitcoin strategic reserve through the introduction of their own bills. Utah, however, leads the pack and has made the most regulatory progress. Its Bitcoin reserve bill is the only bill of its kind to pass through the House.

Some analysts have issued cautionary Tron price predictions, pointing to the bearish signals. Tron holders dissatisfied with the uncertainty around the token are looking for opportunities with high upside potential. 1Fuel (OFT) has been gaining their attention with its ongoing presale recording immense success. Its momentum suggests a 20x surge, and investors are betting on it. Tron Price prediction: Is TRX headed for a major drop? TRX reached a high of $0.44 in December. However, it declined to $0.20 in early February before rebounding to its current price of $0.24. This slight bullish signal raises concerns, as the chart shows the major resistance it must overcome. The RSI climbed above the neutral 50.00 mark, suggesting a bullish run based on its recent rebound. However, the super trend indicator remains bearish, with the red line sitting above TRX’s current price. This suggests a downward pressure. TRX price movement has formed a descending channel, and its current price is at the channel’s upper boundary. While some analysts may see this as a sign of a breakout, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) displays a negative reading. This indicates a bearish divergence that could impede TRX’s hope of breaking upwards. If TRX fails to hold its current level at $0.24, it could fall back to the $0.20 level. If the downward pressure continues, TRX may dip to $0.16 or lower. Given these indicators, Tron price predictions remain cautious, with potential challenges ahead for TRX holders. 1Fuel (OFT) could be a game-changer with 20x potential TRX penetrated the market with its innovation, giving it a new alternative. Its utility and positioning have given it massive success over the past years. 1Fuel (OFT) follows in these footsteps with its revolutionary innovation that will transform how investors manage their digital assets online and offline. With its technology, 1Fuel strategically positions itself to ride market hype and community backing. Its ongoing presale has been massively successful, raising over $2.2 million in token sales in the last three months. Over 220 million OFT tokens have been sold to thousands of unique holders, signaling a growing community that will amplify its hype in the coming weeks. While TRX is struggling with a clear market direction, 1Fuel(OFT) is in an expansion phase that is getting the right reaction from investors. Its ongoing stage 4 presale price is pegged at $0.018. If it aims for TRX’s current price at $0.24, early investors could see a more than 20x gain at the launch date. 1Fuel (OFT) has strong tokenomics and a roadmap that fuels investors’ confidence. It communicates that it is building for the long term, which is what investors today are looking for. Investors today are looking for this stability with a high return on investment.

Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL), a well-known figure in the XRP community, recently asked followers for their price predictions for 2025. The responses varied widely, ranging from modest growth to astronomical price targets. Some members of the XRP community foresee a steady rise, while others predict explosive growth fueled by potential legal resolutions and institutional adoption. One response suggested that if all conditions align, XRP could surge to “$250-800” before a correction to $160. Another expects it to reach $13.26, while multiple commenters mentioned $13 as a reasonable target. Another commenter projected that XRP would first climb to $15-20 before FOMO (fear of missing out) drives it even higher. Notably, a well-known crypto analyst recently predicted that XRP could hit $13-$15 by March 10 , adding credence to these predictions. Lofty Expectations For XRP There were also more aggressive forecasts, with one user suggesting that XRP could surpass $10,000 after achieving market stability. Another predicted that the asset could surpass $1,000 by mirroring 2017 performance when it surged by 37,000%. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, another prominent analyst recently showed why XRP may fail to repeat its 2017 performance in this cycle, and some commenters offered more cautious predictions , such as a peak of $5-$7, followed by a sell-off that could bring it back down to $3. Factors to Influence XRP Price in 2025 While these predictions reflect community sentiment, the price movement will depend on several key factors. Regulatory developments remain a primary driver for XRP’s price performance. The current landscape suggests all regulatory hurdles will soon be gone. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is changing its stance on digital assets, and a former SEC Director believes this shift points toward the dismissal of the XRP lawsuit . Once the case is resolved, some community members believe XRP will experience a significant rally. One community member presented another unique scenario, suggesting that if XRP will replace SWIFT , it will require a high and stable price of around $5,000 to facilitate the volume of international transactions. The XRP community remains hopeful that regulatory clarity and increased adoption will drive prices higher. The replies are overwhelmingly bullish, and many in the community are confident that XRP will have a remarkable year.

Ever wondered where savvy investors park their funds when global markets get shaky? Look no further than gold. Right now, the gold price is making headlines, standing tall near its all-time peak. Why? Because whispers of escalating trade tensions and potential tariffs are sending jitters through the markets. Let’s dive into what’s fueling this golden surge and what it means for your investment portfolio. Why Gold Price is Firm Amid Trade War Rumors The gold price is exhibiting remarkable resilience, currently trading around $2,944, just shy of yesterday’s record high. This firmness stems from growing anxieties about a potential global trade war sparked by US President Donald Trump’s tariff threats. When investors anticipate economic uncertainty, they often flock to safe-haven assets, and gold is the quintessential safe haven. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors driving gold’s appeal: Trade War Fears: Trump’s announcement of impending tariffs on imported goods has ignited concerns about a global trade war. This uncertainty boosts gold’s safe-haven appeal. Sliding US Bond Yields: Lower US bond yields are weakening the US Dollar, making dollar-denominated gold more attractive to international buyers. Geopolitical Instability: Beyond trade, broader geopolitical uncertainties often drive investors towards the safety of gold. Essentially, gold is acting as a financial shock absorber, gaining value as other asset classes face headwinds from these global uncertainties. Hawkish Fed Outlook: Will it Cap the Gold Rally? While trade tensions and economic uncertainties are propelling gold price upwards, there’s a potential headwind: the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) stance on interest rates. Recent FOMC minutes revealed a hawkish outlook, suggesting a possible pause in rate cuts. Historically, higher interest rates can make gold less attractive as it doesn’t offer a yield, unlike interest-bearing assets. However, the impact of the Fed’s outlook seems to be overshadowed by the more immediate concerns of a trade war. Even with the slightly overbought conditions indicated by the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the bullish momentum in gold remains strong. It suggests that for now, the fear of economic disruption from tariffs is outweighing the potential dampening effect of Fed policy. Trump’s Tariffs: A Booster for Safe-Haven Gold? US President Trump’s recent statements are directly influencing the gold price . His vow to impose “heavy tariffs” on numerous products next month or sooner has intensified fears of a trade war. This announcement acted as a catalyst, further solidifying gold’s position as a safe-haven asset . Adding fuel to the fire, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s comments about Trump’s aim to potentially abolish the IRS have added another layer of economic uncertainty. While Trump also mentioned the possibility of a new trade deal with China, the immediate market reaction is clearly tilted towards concern, benefiting gold. USD Weakness Further Supports Gold Price Interestingly, the US Dollar (USD) is struggling to capitalize on any recovery attempts, further bolstering the gold price . Typically, a stronger dollar can weigh on gold, as it becomes more expensive for buyers using other currencies. However, the current weakness in US Treasury bond yields is preventing the USD from gaining traction. This creates a favorable environment for gold, making it cheaper for international investors and increasing its appeal. In essence, the weaker dollar acts as an additional tailwind, pushing the gold price higher in conjunction with the trade tensions and safe-haven demand. Economic Data and Fed Speak: What to Watch This Week Looking ahead, several economic data releases and speeches from Fed officials could influence both the USD and the gold price . Keep an eye on: US Weekly Initial Jobless Claims: Provides insights into the labor market’s health. Philly Fed Manufacturing Index: Gauges manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia region. Speeches by FOMC Members: Any further hints about the Fed’s interest rate path can impact market sentiment. Flash Global PMIs (Friday): These will offer a broader view of global economic health and could provide further direction for safe-haven assets like gold. These data points will offer clues about the economic outlook and potentially sway investor sentiment, influencing the trajectory of the gold price . Technical Analysis: Is Gold Overbought? From a technical standpoint, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) for gold is currently above 70. This level often signals overbought conditions, suggesting that the gold price might be due for a consolidation or a slight pullback. Key Technical Levels to Watch: Level Significance $2,945 – $2,950 Immediate resistance; breakout could signal further upside. $2,928 Immediate support level. $2,918 Overnight swing low; potential buying opportunity. $2,900 Key psychological support level. While caution is warranted due to overbought signals, the overall technical bias remains bullish. A sustained move above $2,950 could pave the way for further gains, continuing the established uptrend. Conversely, any significant drop below $2,900 would warrant closer attention for potential bearish signals. Tariffs: Your Quick FAQs Confused about tariffs? Let’s break down some common questions: What are tariffs? Tariffs are essentially taxes imposed on imported goods. They make imported products more expensive, aiming to protect domestic industries by giving them a price advantage. Tariffs vs. Taxes: What’s the Difference? While both generate government revenue, tariffs are paid by importers at the port of entry, whereas taxes are paid by consumers or businesses at the point of sale or income generation. Are Tariffs Good or Bad? Economists are divided. Some argue tariffs protect local jobs and correct trade imbalances. Others worry they lead to higher prices for consumers and retaliatory tariffs, sparking damaging trade wars. Trump’s Tariff Plan: What’s the Goal? Trump aims to use tariffs to boost the US economy and support American producers, particularly targeting imports from Mexico, China, and Canada. He also intends to use tariff revenue to reduce income taxes. Conclusion: Gold’s Glitter in Uncertain Times The gold price is currently shining brightly, fueled by escalating trade tensions and its enduring status as a safe-haven asset . While technical indicators suggest some caution in the short term, the underlying bullish narrative remains strong. As global economic uncertainties persist and tariffs become a looming reality, gold is likely to continue to attract investor interest. For crypto investors looking to diversify and hedge against market volatility, understanding the dynamics of the gold market and its reaction to geopolitical events is increasingly crucial.

With this, the Japanese firm also attained the milestone of acquiring 0.01% of the total BTC supply. Besides, the firm has also set an ambitious target to 10x its BTC holdings within the next two years, by the end of 2026. Metaplanet Achieves 10% of Its Final Target Earlier today, Japan’s MicroStrategy announced the purchase of an additional 68.59 BTC for approximately $6.6 million, at an average price of $96,335 per bitcoin. This shows that the company has managed to squeeze in on the Bitcoin dips before the BTC price recovery back to $97,000. The company’s Bitcoin holdings have yielded an impressive 18% year-to-date (YTD) return in 2025. As of February 20, 2025, Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin reserve stands at 2,100 BTC, acquired at a cumulative cost of $169.9 million, averaging $80,905 per BTC. Since initiating its Bitcoin strategy in April 2024, the firm has significantly grown its holdings, reaffirming its conviction that Bitcoin is the world’s only truly scarce asset. Speaking on the development, company CEO Simon Gerovich stated: “This milestone is just one step in our long-term plan to reach 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and 21,000 BTC by the end of 2026, as Metaplanet remains committed to our Bitcoin-first strategy and maximizing long-term shareholder value”. Raising Another $20 Million To Bolster Bitcoin Strategy Japan’s MicroStrategy has secured approximately $20 million in equity capital during the first two trading days of its “21M Plan,” a strategic initiative designed to bolster its Bitcoin-focused investment strategy. The announcement came from Metaplanet Bitcoin Strategist Dylan LeClair, highlighting the company’s commitment to reinforcing its BTC holdings and advancing its long-term vision. Earlier this week, the company announced successfully raising JPY 4 billion through 0% unsecured bonds, with the funds earmarked for further Bitcoin acquisitions in 2026 and 2027. It also revealed that it has allocated over $700 million toward its previous initiative to add 21,000 BTC to its Treasury by the end of 2026, underscoring its continued commitment to its Bitcoin strategy. MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor has also appreciated the Japanese firm’s roadmap to build its BTC reserves. One Basis Point of Bitcoin https://t.co/KnNyajjwEa — Michael Saylor (@saylor) February 20, 2025 Metaplanet Stock to Hit New All-Time High Soon? Metaplanet stock has surged a staggering 75% since the beginning of 2025 hitting an all-time high above 7,000 JPY earlier this month. After partial retracement from the highs, the stock is once again on the upward trajectory gaining 2% today moving to 6,260 levels. The firm also achieved the distinction of being the largest component in the CoinShares Blockchain Global Equity Index (BLOCK Index), holding a 6.27% weighting. “We’re honored to stand alongside industry leaders and remain committed to demonstrating what a Bitcoin-first approach can achieve for listed companies,” noted Gerovich.

Apple has just dropped a bombshell – the iPhone 16e, a budget-friendly device packed with cutting-edge AI, hitting the market on February 28th. For crypto enthusiasts and tech aficionados alike, this launch signals Apple’s serious play in the AI race, potentially impacting how we interact with technology daily and even influencing the broader tech investment landscape. Let’s dive into what makes this new AI smartphone a potential game-changer. Introducing the iPhone 16e: Apple’s Bold Step into Affordable AI Forget the ‘SE’ moniker; Apple is streamlining its branding with the iPhone 16e , positioning it firmly within the iPhone 16 family. This isn’t just a refresh; it’s a reimagining of what a budget phone can be. Priced at $599, the iPhone 16e is designed to democratize access to premium features, most notably, Apple Intelligence. But what exactly is Apple Intelligence, and why should you care? Apple Intelligence: Think of it as Apple’s answer to AI giants like ChatGPT and Gemini. It’s not just cloud-based; a significant portion runs directly on the device, ensuring privacy and speed. On-Device AI Capabilities: The iPhone 16e can summarize texts, draft emails, and even generate images, all offline. This on-device processing is a major leap, making AI functionalities more accessible and secure. Exclusive AI Club: The 16e joins the iPhone 16 series and iPhone 15 Pro as the select few handsets capable of harnessing the full power of Apple Intelligence. This exclusivity is a strategic move by Apple, creating a tiered AI experience. Powering the iPhone 16e: The A18 Chip and Apple C1 Modem At the heart of this budget iPhone ‘s AI prowess lies the A18 processor. This isn’t a watered-down chip; it’s the same powerhouse found in the flagship iPhone 16 lineup. Why is this significant? Flagship Performance in a Budget Device: The A18 chip ensures that the iPhone 16e isn’t just affordable but also incredibly powerful, capable of handling demanding AI tasks and applications smoothly. Apple’s Silicon Independence: The iPhone 16e also debuts Apple’s in-house modem, the Apple C1. This move away from Qualcomm and Intel signals Apple’s commitment to controlling its silicon destiny, potentially leading to greater efficiency and integration. Design and Features: A Modern Makeover The iPhone 16e isn’t just about internal upgrades; it’s received a significant design overhaul, bringing it in line with modern smartphone aesthetics. Say goodbye to the old and hello to the new: Feature iPhone 16e Previous iPhone SE Home Button Gone (Face ID) Touch ID Authentication Face ID Touch ID Camera Notch iPhone X-style notch Traditional bezel Charging Port USB-C Lightning These changes aren’t just cosmetic; they represent Apple’s move towards standardization and modern user expectations. The shift to USB-C, in particular, is a welcome change for many users already invested in USB-C ecosystems. Strategic Timing: China and the Global Market The launch of the iPhone 16e comes at a critical juncture for Apple. A recent 11% market share dip in China highlights the challenges Apple faces in this crucial market. Factors at play include: Rise of Domestic Competitors: Huawei and other Chinese smartphone makers are gaining ground, offering compelling alternatives. Apple Intelligence Availability in China: Currently, Apple Intelligence isn’t available in mainland China, potentially hindering the iPhone 16e’s appeal in this AI-centric market. Localized AI Partnerships: Apple is actively seeking partnerships with Chinese tech giants like Tencent, ByteDance, and Alibaba to bring localized generative AI solutions to China. The original iPhone SE was a hit in both China and India. Apple is betting that this more advanced AI smartphone , despite a slight price increase, can regain lost ground in these vital markets. The $599 price point, while a $100 increase from the last SE, still positions it as an accessible entry point into the Apple ecosystem, now supercharged with AI. Pre-orders and Availability: Mark Your Calendars Ready to get your hands on the iPhone 16e? Here are the key dates: Pre-orders Open: Friday, February 21st Shipping Starts: Friday, February 28th The iPhone 16e represents a fascinating development – a budget-conscious device that doesn’t skimp on cutting-edge technology. Its success could redefine the budget smartphone segment and further solidify Apple’s position in the AI race. For crypto and tech enthusiasts, the integration of powerful AI into a more accessible device is a trend worth watching closely, as it could shape future consumer behavior and tech investments.

The country’s Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) has given Hashdex the go-ahead for its XRP ETF. Meanwhile, the ETF is set to debut on the B3 stock exchange, offering investors direct exposure to XRP. XRP ETF Finally Gets Approval According to recent reports, Brazil’s CVM has approved the Hashdex Nasdaq XRP Index Fund, making it the first spot XRP ETF to receive official regulatory backing. However, established on December 10, 2024, the fund is now in its pre-operational phase, awaiting final clearance from the B3 stock exchange before trading can begin. Hashdex, the asset manager behind the fund, has yet to announce the official listing date. This approval is a big step forward as more people worldwide show interest in crypto ETFs. Meanwhile, investors want safe and regulated ways to invest in digital assets, and Brazil’s quick action puts it ahead of many other countries in meeting this need. XRP ETF Interest Grows Worldwide Several major firms, including Bitwise, 21Shares, CoinShares, and Grayscale, have recently filed applications for spot XRP ETFs. However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to approve any of these applications. Meanwhile, Bloomberg senior ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas both estimate a 65% chance of approval but suggest that the SEC may delay any decision until its lawsuit against Ripple is fully resolved. XRP Price Recorded 7% Gain After Brazil approved the XRP ETF, the price of XRP jumped by 7%, reaching around $2.67 in the last 24 hours. This rise made XRP the best-performing asset among the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a 10% gain over the week. Although recent data from Coinglass shows that XRP saw $8.20 million in future liquidations during this time. Out of this, $2.31 million came from long positions, while $5.69 million came from short positions. Meanwhile, Key Market indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) suggest strong buying momentum, hinting at more possible gains for XRP.",News,EN,0,0,XRP|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-20 07:41:06

After years of delay, the mainnet will finally go live today, February 20, 2025, at 8 AM UTC. After this, the investors could trade, transfer, and use their Pi coin freely, but there’s much more to know and understand. Let’s discuss what is coming next with this milestone. Pi Network Mainnet Launch Today: What Will Change After This? Similar to Hamster Kombat and X Empire, Pi Network uses the same tap-to-earn approach. Users earn Pi coins by tapping on the screen and referring their friends. It is among the most anticipated events because of its simplicity and low-effort coin-earning opportunities, attracting millions of users. The Pi Network mainnet launch is scheduled for February 20 at 8 AM UTC. After this, the coins that were worth nothing will finally gain value and become tradeable in the crypto market. In short, investors can buy, sell, transfer, and use Pi coin for transactions. More importantly, various popular crypto exchanges and platforms like OKX, Bitget, and others have already announced their listing. However, Binance is due for listing but is conducting a community poll to consider the listing. Amid this hype, there are also regulatory concerns. Some experts call the Pi a scam or Ponzi scheme, while others question its working model. More importantly, there are concerns over its long-term performance, especially since Hamster Kombat, which had a similar model and hype, failed. This token launch and its significant price performance will relieve user claims or concerns. Overall, this mainnet launch would bring the network much better clarity and assist in its further developments. What Will Pi Coin’s Price Performance Be After Launch? Parallel with mixed reactions to investors’ sentiments on the Pi Network mainnet, the Pi coin price shows similar mixed performance under high volatility. Just a few days ago, the IOU price of this Pi Network hit a high of $200 amid bullish investor sentiments per TradingView . However, momentum failed over time, and the token crashed significantly. At present, PI (IOU) trades at $30.99 after a 52% drop in the last 24 hours alone, showing high volatility. As the mainnet launch approaches, market participants might become uncertain about the future price of Pi coins, leading to a sell-off and a price drop, says analysts. Considering this, three scenarios regarding the Pi Network token’s price after launch can be anticipated. The first is price stability and a potential rally to $120 or higher. However, this will only happen if the strong bullish momentum persists and top exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and others list the token. However, the second scenario contrasts with this Pi coin prediction , where the long-term holders’ selling sentiments could change the trajectory. If a mass sell-off happens, the price could decline even further. Some analysts claim that a downtrend to $17 or lower. The last scenario is based on the equilibrium of buyers and sellers. If this happens, the price can stay stagnant at current levels. Depending on the token’s real-world usage and developments past the Pi Network mainnet, momentum will build over time. Final Thoughts: Is Pi Network’s Future Bright With Mainnet? Pi Network is finally launching its mainnet and native token after years of delays. Although this brings optimism to users, its ongoing controversies cannot be ignored. There are mixed opinions from the investors, fueling uncertainty about Pi coin’s future price performance. The Binance listing voting results, due on February 27, could provide more clarity. However, until then, high volatility will likely control the token. At present, Pi Network is among the industry’s most trending topics, both positively and negatively. Economic Times claims that Pi’s application installation has reached 110 million. On February 17, 540,000 new users joined the network, showing high demand. If this topic keeps trending in the market and the Pi coin gains significant rallies, the Pi Network’s future could turn bright. Investors must carefully consider trading in this token.

Notably, the surge in Ripple’s native asset comes amid a broader crypto market recovery, indicating renewed confidence of the investors towards digital assets. Besides, it also comes amid market optimism surrounding the XRP ETF developments, which might have further bolstered the confidence of the investors. Why Is XRP Price Rising Today? XRP price has recorded a massive surge today amid a broader market recovery. Here we explore some of the top reasons that might have contributed to the recent gains of Ripple’s native asset. Crypto Market Recovery The broader crypto market today has witnessed a positive momentum, which might have helped gains in the token. For context, Bitcoin price hovered around the $97K mark with its last 24-hour performance remaining in the green. On the other hand, other top altcoins like Solana, Cardano, and others have also stayed in the green. It appears that the positive regulatory developments in the US and shifting institutional focus towards the digital assets space have helped gain XRP price today. XRP ETF Gaining Momentum A flurry of XRP ETF developments might have acted as a major catalyst behind the recent surge in Ripple’s native asset. For context, Hashdex has secured approval to launch the first Spot XRP ETF in Brazil . However, the market participants are now awaiting an official announcement of the launch date by Brazil’s B3 exchange. On the other hand, the US SEC has acknowledged a flurry of ETF filings for the crypto, further bolstering market sentiment. For context, the regulators have recently acknowledged ETF filings by Canary Capital and WisdomTree. Also, this comes just after the US SEC acknowledged XRP ETF filings from Bitwise, Grayscale, and 21Shares. Considering all these aspects, the market is betting towards a potential launch for the investment instrument in the US soon. According to Polymarket data, there is an 80% chance of Ripple ETF launching in the US in 2025. Source: Polymarket Regulatory Development Fuels Market Sentiment The US’s shifting stance towards a pro-crypto regulatory environment has fueled market sentiment. For context, the US SEC has halted several crypto cases like the Binance and Coinbase lawsuit, sparking market speculations. Now, the market is anticipating a similar move by the regulators for the long-running Ripple Vs SEC case. On the other hand, Donald Trump has recently mentioned Ripple and XRP on the Truth Social platform. This movement has also gained market attention, with recent Ripple price analysis hinting towards a potential $100 rally ahead. What’s Next For XRP Price? XRP price has surged about 6% today and hovered near the $2.7 mark, while its trading volume soared 7% to $5.37 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high and low of $2.74 and $2.55, respectively. Besides, XRP Futures Open Interest also rose 6% to $4.07 billion, reflecting the positive market sentiment, CoinGlass data showed. Amid this, a top market expert EGRAG CRYPTO has shared key insights on the price trajectory of the coin. In a recent X post, the expert noted that if the XRP price maintains a strong momentum above $2.62, it could target $2.83 next. In addition, EGRAG CRYPTO noted that once it breaks above the $2.83 support, it will target between the $2.9 and $3.10 range. So, looking at the current performance, it appears that the crypto is likely to reclaim the $3 mark soon.

Mistral AI, a rising European startup, has announced that its AI assistant, Le Chat, has achieved a phenomenal milestone: 1 million downloads in just 14 days . This explosive growth signals a significant moment in the AI app landscape, especially for those keenly following cryptocurrency and tech innovations. Why is Mistral Le Chat Achieving Such Rapid Downloads? Several factors are contributing to the impressive download numbers of Mistral Le Chat . Firstly, the app quickly ascended to the top spot for free downloads on the iOS App Store in France, Mistral’s home country. This rapid ascent indicates strong initial interest and positive user reception. Furthermore, the endorsement from French President Emmanuel Macron played a crucial role. Macron publicly recommended Le Chat over competitors like OpenAI’s ChatGPT during a TV interview, urging citizens to support homegrown AI technology. This national backing provided a significant boost to the app’s visibility and credibility. Let’s break down the key elements fueling Le Chat’s success: Homegrown Advantage: Being a French company, Mistral benefits from national pride and government support, as highlighted by President Macron’s endorsement. Direct Competition to Giants: Le Chat is positioned as a direct alternative to established AI assistants like ChatGPT, attracting users seeking alternatives. European Innovation: In a market often dominated by US and Chinese tech, a European AI success story is compelling and draws attention. App Store Visibility: Reaching the top of the free app charts in France significantly increases organic discovery and downloads. Mistral Le Chat vs. The Competition: How Does the AI Assistant App Stack Up? While Mistral Le Chat’s rapid download figures are impressive, it’s essential to contextualize them within the broader AI assistant market. OpenAI’s ChatGPT, launched in November 2023, also experienced rapid growth, achieving 500,000 downloads in just six days, albeit initially restricted to the U.S. iOS App Store. ChatGPT’s total downloads have now soared to a staggering 350 million, according to Appfigures. Another notable example is DeepSeek’s mobile app, which also reached 1 million downloads between January 10 and January 31. DeepSeek’s app went viral in late January, adding millions of users quickly. These examples demonstrate that rapid initial adoption is possible in the AI app space, but sustained growth and long-term user engagement are crucial for lasting success. Here’s a quick comparison table: AI Assistant App Company Time to 1 Million Downloads (approx.) Key Highlights Mistral Le Chat Mistral AI 14 days French origin, Presidential endorsement, rapid ascent in France ChatGPT OpenAI ~6 days (to 500k) Global leader, massive total downloads, established brand DeepSeek App DeepSeek ~21 days Viral growth, Chinese app, rapid user acquisition The Broader AI Assistant App Landscape: Beyond Downloads The race for dominance in the artificial intelligence app market is heating up. Beyond startups like Mistral and DeepSeek, tech giants like Google and Microsoft are aggressively pushing their AI assistants, Gemini and Copilot, respectively. These companies possess vast resources and established user bases, posing significant competition. The ultimate goal for these tech players is to secure a prime spot on users’ smartphones, making AI assistants an integral part of daily digital life. Challenges and Opportunities in the AI App Market: User Acquisition Cost: Attracting and retaining users in a crowded app market requires significant marketing investment. Technological Advancement: Continuous innovation and improvement in AI capabilities are crucial to stay ahead of the curve. User Privacy and Data Security: Addressing concerns about data privacy and security is paramount for building user trust. Monetization Strategies: Developing sustainable monetization models for AI assistant apps is an ongoing challenge. Integration and Ecosystem: Seamless integration with other apps and services will enhance user experience and stickiness. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and App Store Downloads? Mistral’s Le Chat’s swift ascent to 1 million downloads is a powerful indicator of the growing appetite for AI assistant apps . It underscores the potential for new players to disrupt the market and challenge the dominance of established giants. For investors and enthusiasts in the cryptocurrency and tech space, this trend highlights the importance of monitoring the artificial intelligence app sector for emerging opportunities and disruptive technologies. The race to create the most indispensable and user-friendly AI chatbot is just beginning, and Mistral’s early success adds an exciting new chapter to this ongoing narrative.

The implementation of SIMD 96 decreased the amount of SOL burned daily from 18,000 SOL to 1,000 SOL, impacting the real economic value (REV) distributed to token holders. The Solana Improvement Document 96 (SIMD 96) proposed adjusting the priority fee structure to reward validators with 100% of the fees collected instead of using half of them to burn SOL. The SIMD 96 proposal introduced by partners at Multicoin Capital Tushar Jain and Vishal Kankan aimed to boost SOL’s inflation if the amount staked fell below 50% of the supply. Conversely, the inflation rate will reduce accordingly if the amount surpasses 50%. Onchain data revealed that the token holder REV percentage gradually fell from 72% to 40.9% on February 16th, while validator commission slowly grew from 25.1% to 56.1%. Carlos Campo, a Blockworks researcher, said that this raised the SOL annualized inflation from 3.6% to 4.7% as the SOL weekly burn rate reached 6.93% from February 10th to February 16th, the lowest level since mid-October 2024 and nearly half the ratio of the previous week. According to Campo, Solana enthusiasts were now waiting for the approval of SIMD 228, which will reform SOL’s inflation mechanism to a dynamic ratio based on the amount of staked SOL. SIMD 96 incentivizes validators to prioritize network security and efficiency 3/ The chart below shows the distribution of network REV (fees and tips to stakeholders). In the 30 days prior to the activation of SIMD 96: – Token Holders: 67% – Validators: 30% Since the activation of SIMD 96: – Token Holders: 46% – Validators: 51%❗️ In the coming weeks,… pic.twitter.com/NyKgKlJRTq — Carlos (@0xcarlosg) February 19, 2025 The SIMD 96 proposal, approved in May 2024, suggested that a previous model user would prefer to directly pay a block producer to prioritize its transaction rather than pay a priority fee to the network, with the block producer receiving only half the value. According to the proposal, the goal of SIMD 96 is to boost validator incentives and discourage side deals. According to Campo, the distribution of network REV (fees and tips to stakeholders) in the 30 days prior to the activation of SIMD 96 saw token holders receive 67% while validators received 30%. However, token holders and validators have now received 46% and 51%, respectively, since the activation of SIMD 96. Campo added that validators would hopefully start using Jito’s TipRouter to distribute priority fees to stakers in the coming weeks. “Notably, SIMD 123 would create an in-protocol solution to share priority fees with stakers natively, but this development is likely months away.” – Carlos Campo Campo argued that while SIMD 96 could potentially lead to a reduction in priority fees, ‘that hasn’t been the case’. The median priority fee remained flat in SOL terms aside from spikes caused by recent volatility events. Solana validator revenue surges amid fears of stakers missing out According to Blockworks Research, some in the crypto community were calling for Solana to pump the brakes on the SIMD 96 implementation until validators were able to share the extra fees with stakers. Some developers on Solana also argued that SIMD 96 could incentivize priority fee ‘spoofing’ where validators could artificially raise priority fees to rake in more rewards. Blockworks Research revealed that Solana’s priority fees totaled about $240 million in January. Tim Garcia, the Solana Foundation validator relations lead, said a newer SIMD 123 proposal would allow validators to share priority fees directly with stakers. However, he disclosed that the proposal had little chance of being implemented together with SIMD 96 as things stood. Stakers will, therefore, have to rely on the goodwill of validators to share the extra rewards until SIMD 123 is activated. According to Blockworks Research, some were calling for Solana to approve SIMD 123 alongside SIMD 96 so that stakers could share in the ‘windfall’. Mert Mumtaz, CEO of the largest Solana validator in Helius, said validators only ‘overcompensated’ if they did not share back the rewards.

Analysts say BTC could reach $450,000 in this cycle. If this happens, the XRP price could also skyrocket. In the past, XRP stock jumped 15,000% in strong markets. Now, with the Bitcoin to USD rate growing, could MTAUR follow the trend? Bitcoin’s Price Moves Higher The Bitcoin price today is $97,195, up 1.91% in 24 hours. The market cap is now $1.92 trillion, showing strong demand. But, BTC transaction volume has dropped 23.78%, meaning fewer short-term exchanges. Even so, the trend is still up. Institutional buyers are driving the growth. The number of institutional holders of Bitcoin ETFs has increased 54.5x since last March. This shows that big funds are flowing into BTC, reducing supply and keeping prices strong. The total supply of Bitcoin USD is near its limit, with 19.82 million BTC already in circulation. With more demand and less available supply, a push to $450,000 seems possible in this cycle. A new Bitcoin news report shows that the Stock-to-Flow model points to $450,000 as a possible target. If this happens, BTC would reach a new record high. This price model has accurately predicted Bitcoin’s past cycles, and current market conditions suggest a similar trend. If Bitcoin USD follows this path, it could reshape the entire crypto market. Historical patterns show that when BTC reaches new highs, altcoins also see major price moves. This could be a game-changer for XRP Ripple and other assets looking for a breakout. If the price of Bitcoin keeps rising, the whole crypto market could react. XRP Ripple has followed Bitcoin’s moves in past cycles. If BTC jumps to $450,000, altcoins like XRP could also see massive price moves. Some analysts suggest that we are entering a stage similar to previous bull runs, where Bitcoin’s dominance leads the way before altcoins experience even bigger percentage growth. XRP Price Grows as Holders Watch Bitcoin The XRP price today is $2.70, rising 7.14% in the past 24 hours. Its market cap has grown to $156.58 billion, showing increased interest. However, XRP price USD volume fell 5.76%, meaning some holders are waiting. Even with this drop, the outlook remains positive. XRP Ripple is currently in a strong uptrend, gaining traction as Bitcoin’s momentum grows. The total circulating supply stands at 57.81 billion XRP, with a max supply of 100 billion XRP, meaning there is still room for controlled supply distribution. Recent XRP news shows that if BTC continues rising, XRP price could see massive growth. In past cycles, the XRP stock jumped by 15,000%. Analysts now predict that if Bitcoin reaches $450,000, XRP price USD could jump 600%. This means the price of XRP could hit $18.90, making it one of the strongest-performing altcoins. Some holders believe that the Fibonacci-based target of 1.618 aligns well with this estimate, as it historically marks key turning points in crypto market trends. Many holders believe XRP Ripple has strong potential beyond Bitcoin’s impact. Some expect XRP to rise because of real-world use. It has a history of being used for fast transactions with low fees, making it attractive for banks and payment providers. If more institutions adopt XRP, its price could keep climbing beyond just speculative growth. Will MTAUR Join the Rally? Crypto projects with real use cases are rare, but Minotaurus (MTAUR) is changing the game. With 1,742,000+ USDT in purchases, the presale is drawing in buyers who see more than just short-term potential. At 0.00010517 USDT, MTAUR is still at an early presale stage. However, once it reaches 0.00020 USDT, early buyers could be securing a 90% difference before the token even hits exchanges. 400% structured growth from the initial price of 0.000040 USDT further benefits those who act early. More than a token, MTAUR is essential to the Minotaurus game, where players spend tokens to enhance their gameplay, unlock exclusive features, and access premium content. Unlike speculative projects with no long-term vision, MTAUR is built for sustained adoption. A low 5,600,000 USDT market cap, 10% of the supply dedicated to community incentives, and a 100,000 USDT giveaway make MTAUR a well-rounded project. With influencers shining a spotlight on the presale, the opportunity to buy at this price won’t last long. Conclusion If Bitcoin price today keeps rising, it could push BTC to $450,000. This could also send XRP price to $18.90, based on past trends. With a growing crypto market, coins like MTAUR could benefit too. Built on solid fundamentals and predictable milestones, Minotaurus offers a smart and accessible opportunity.

During the election campaign itself, he promised to bring pro-crypto policies to support the industry. Now, while speaking at the Future Investment Initiative Priority Summit in Miami, the US president states that his administration, with executive orders , has ended the ‘so-called’ war of the Biden regime against the cryptocurrency industry. Here is everything you should know. Trump’s Commitment to US Crypto Leadership The new US regime recently established a special crypto task force under the US Securities and Exchange Commission in an effort to develop a clear cryptocurrency regulation framework. There are rumours that the US government is preparing to create a cryptocurrency reserve . Expressing his commitment to creating pro-crypto policies to develop the industry, Trump asserts that he is committed to making America the crypto capital. #Trump vows to establish the U.S. as the global hub for #cryptocurrency innovation. #CoinPedia #CryptoNews #Blockchain #CryptoMarket pic.twitter.com/dHhqkf4l4C — Coinpedia (@CoinpediaNews) February 20, 2025 Ending ‘Biden’s War on Crypto’ The previous US SEC leadership, under Gary Gensler, adopted a restrictive approach towards the crypto industry. It attacked the industry with complex cases and hefty fines. At the behest of the Biden administration, the SEC dragged several prominent crypto firms, including Binance and Coinbase, to courtrooms. Binance was even forced to wind up its US operations. Now, Trump claims that he has put an end to this restrictive framework with executive orders. Industry Leaders on the US’ New Approach Recently, Binance CEO Richard Teng, while speaking at the Consensus Crypto Conference, admitted that the new US administration has brought relief to the crypto sector. He even stated that the new regime has given a fresh beginning to the sector. Interestingly, the new regime, under Trump, has appointed pro-crypto leaders to key White House positions. The appointment of Howard Lutnick as the US Commerce Secretary has been the latest in a series of such appointments. It appears that the new Trump regime is very keen to turn the US into a true Crypto Capital. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The price plunged below the psychological barrier at $170, validating a continued descending trend. When the lower targets at $150 have been activated, the optimism around the token remains higher. This suggests the token could be trading within a controlled environment and as a result, the SOL price may be primed for a sudden and quick rebound. While the SOL price is feared to drop towards the lower range, its DEX volume is getting heated up. It has been over $2B to $3B while the price maintained a consistent descending trend. On the other hand, the active address count over the Solana network dropped from $18.5 million in November to just $8.4 million. In the times when the bearish pressure was trying hard to outpower the bullish possibility, the SOL price triggered a strong rebound back above $170, squashing the bearish trajectory for a while. The recent pullback had turned the Gaussian channel into bearish, which continues to flash bearish signals regardless of the current rebound. Despite a bullish reversal in the RSI, the price is expected to remain consolidated within the lower range until the channel turns back to bullish. Therefore, the SOL price is believed to experience equal bullish and bearish pressure in the next few days while the volume could remain below the average. The current trade setup does not show a large possibility of a breakout beyond $175 in the short term. However, as the market sentiments ease a bit, the buying volume is expected to rise, which could further elevate the Solana (SOL) price above the bearish range. Hence, the SOL price continues to remain under bullish influence, regardless of the interim pullbacks.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|SOL|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-20 07:58:32

Analyst Explains,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-bitcoin-showing-early-signs-of-bullish-divergence-analyst-explains/,"According to a recent post on X by crypto analyst Rekt Capital, Bitcoin (BTC) may finally be showing early signs of bullish divergence. If this pattern plays out, BTC could target the $101,000 level as its first milestone before moving higher. Bitcoin Showing Signs Of Bullish Divergence? Analyst Weighs In Since the beginning of February, the flagship cryptocurrency has endured multiple macroeconomic uncertainties, including US President Donald Trump’s proposed trade tariffs, the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) hawkish statements, and the stock market downturn triggered by the release of China’s DeepSeek AI model. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slides To $94,000 After CPI Surprise – Will The Downtrend Continue? Despite these challenges, BTC has remained range-bound between $93,000 and $98,000. However, early signs of a potential bullish divergence are beginning to emerge. Rekt Capital pointed out BTC’s repeated failure to achieve a successful daily close above the $97,700 level, forcing it to find support around $93,000 at the lower end of its trading channel. While BTC continues to consolidate within this tight range, it is displaying a bullish divergence, as the cryptocurrency’s relative strength index (RSI) has formed a higher low on the daily chart. In this context, bullish divergence occurs when the price continues making lower lows while the RSI reverses course and forms a higher low. This momentum shift often signals an impending trend reversal, potentially propelling BTC toward the crucial $100,000 level. However, not all analysts are convinced that BTC is out of the woods just yet. Crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader shared his perspective on BTC’s price action, emphasizing how the top cryptocurrency recently touched the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $93,500. They cautioned: Historically, closing below this level often means a drop to the 200EMA—currently at $86k. But until the daily 100EMA breaks, there’s no need for panic. Stay sharp, the market is at a pivotal point! Will BTC Fill The CME Gap? Meanwhile, crypto market analyst CryptoBullet pointed to a CME gap from November that BTC may need to fill before resuming its upward momentum. The analyst highlighted a double-top formation, which could lead BTC to retrace down to $76,000 to close the gap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Persistent Resistance at $100K, Analyst Eyes Next Step For those unfamiliar, the “CME gap” refers to a price difference on CME’s Bitcoin futures chart that arises when trading pauses for the weekend while BTC continues moving on other exchanges. These gaps often attract price action, as traders anticipate a revisit due to liquidity, technical factors, and market psychology. On a more optimistic note, Bitwise executives maintain that Bitcoin currently offers a “generational opportunity” despite the ongoing global macroeconomic turmoil. At press time, BTC trades at $96,168, up 1.3% in the past 24 hours.

Despite recent domestic economic data and global uncertainties, the Aussie Dollar has perked up. What’s fueling this surge? Optimism around a potential trade deal between the US and China, sparked by comments from none other than former US President Donald Trump. Let’s dive into the details and understand what this means for the AUD/USD pair and the broader Forex landscape. Australian Dollar Jumps on Trump Trade Deal Optimism The Australian Dollar experienced a noticeable appreciation as markets reacted to signals suggesting a possible thaw in trade relations between the United States and China. Former President Trump hinted at the possibility of a new trade agreement with China, even mentioning a potential visit from Chinese President Xi Jinping. These remarks injected a dose of hope into the market, overshadowing concerns stemming from recent economic data and central bank actions. But why is a potential Trump trade deal so significant for the Australian Dollar? Australia, heavily reliant on trade with China, stands to benefit immensely from smoother trade relations between the world’s two largest economies. Any indication of easing trade tensions is generally seen as positive for the Aussie Dollar. RBA’s Restrictive Policy and the Unemployment Rate Before the Trump-related optimism, the Australian Dollar was navigating a complex economic landscape. Recent domestic data presented a mixed bag: Unemployment Rate Increase: Australia’s Unemployment Rate edged up to 4.1% in January, as anticipated, from 4.0% in December. Employment Change: While the Unemployment Rate increased, Employment Change figures were still positive, coming in at 44K for January, exceeding forecasts. These figures, released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), initially presented a nuanced picture of the Australian economy. Adding to this complexity, Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser emphasized that the central bank’s policy remains “restrictive.” He downplayed concerns about the latest jobs data, highlighting the RBA’s continued focus on taming inflation. This cautious stance from the RBA is crucial in understanding the undercurrents affecting the Australian Dollar. Interest Rates and Central Bank Cues The global economic outlook and central bank policies are major drivers for currency valuations. Here’s a breakdown of recent key events: RBA Rate Cut (Earlier in the Week): The RBA had recently lowered its Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 4.10%, marking the first rate cut in four years. This move initially put downward pressure on the Australian Dollar. PBOC Stance: The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) held its Loan Prime Rates (LPRs) steady, indicating a stable monetary policy in China. FOMC Minutes: The US Federal Reserve’s FOMC Minutes reiterated a cautious approach, emphasizing the need for more data before considering interest rate cuts. This cautious tone generally supports the US Dollar, creating headwinds for other currencies. Despite the RBA’s recent rate cut and the cautious global central bank sentiment, Trump’s comments have seemingly overridden these factors, at least for now, propelling the Australian Dollar upwards. The market is clearly reacting strongly to the potential for improved US-China trade relations. Tariffs and Trade Tensions: A Double-Edged Sword? While Trump’s indication of a possible trade deal is boosting the AUD, it’s crucial to remember the other side of the coin – tariffs . Trump has also reaffirmed plans to impose significant tariffs: Auto Tariffs: Confirmation that auto tariffs will remain at 25%. New Tariffs: Potential 25% tariffs on lumber and forest products, and confirmed 25% tariffs on pharmaceutical and semiconductor imports slated for April. These tariff announcements inject a dose of uncertainty. While a broad trade deal might be beneficial, targeted tariffs could still create friction and impact specific sectors. The market is currently weighing these contrasting signals. As Chester Ntonifor from BCA Research noted, the dollar’s trajectory under Trump’s policies is somewhat predictable, but the overall impact on global trade and currencies remains complex. Technical Outlook for AUD/USD From a technical analysis perspective, the AUD/USD pair is currently navigating interesting levels: Ascending Channel: Trading within an ascending channel, suggesting underlying bullish momentum. RSI: The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) above 50 reinforces a positive outlook. Resistance: Eyes are on the psychological resistance level of 0.6400 and the channel’s upper boundary around 0.6410. Support: Immediate support is near the nine-day EMA at 0.6326, with stronger support around the channel’s lower boundary at 0.6300. The technical indicators, combined with the positive market sentiment, suggest that the Australian Dollar could test higher levels if the optimism surrounding a US-China trade deal persists. Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights Here’s a summary of the key factors influencing the Australian Dollar and actionable insights for Forex traders: Factor Impact on AUD Actionable Insight Trump’s Trade Deal Hint Positive (Short-term boost) Monitor US-China trade deal developments closely. Positive news could lead to further AUD gains. RBA’s Restrictive Policy Neutral to Slightly Negative (Long-term) Watch for RBA statements and upcoming economic data releases for clues on future interest rate decisions. Unemployment Rate Increase Slightly Negative (Limited Impact) While concerning, the increase was expected and offset by positive employment change figures. Global Economic Uncertainty & Tariffs Negative (Potential Risk) Be mindful of potential escalations in trade tensions and global economic slowdown, which could pressure the AUD. Conclusion: Riding the Wave of Optimism, but Cautiously The Australian Dollar’s current surge is primarily fueled by optimistic sentiment surrounding a potential US-China trade deal. While this offers a welcome boost, traders should remain vigilant. The underlying economic factors, including the RBA’s stance, domestic data, and global uncertainties, are still in play. Keep a close watch on further developments regarding US-China trade, central bank communications, and key economic indicators to navigate the AUD/USD pair effectively.

Amidst growing speculation about adjustments to BoJ interest rates , particularly concerning long-term yields, Governor Ueda’s statement has offered a glimpse into the central bank’s current stance. For crypto enthusiasts and investors closely watching global financial trends, understanding the nuances of BoJ’s policy is crucial, as it indirectly impacts broader market sentiment and risk appetite. Ueda’s Clarification on Long-Term Rates: What Happened? On Thursday, Governor Kazuo Ueda stated that his recent meeting with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba was a routine exchange of views, primarily focused on the economy and financial developments in anticipation of the upcoming G20 meeting. Crucially, Ueda explicitly mentioned that discussions did not include long-term rates . This denial is significant as it directly addresses market whispers suggesting a potential shift in the BoJ’s yield curve control policy, a cornerstone of its ultra-loose monetary policy. Here’s a breakdown of the key takeaways from Ueda’s statement: Regular Dialogue: Ueda emphasized that his meeting with PM Shigeru Ishiba was part of a regular exchange, indicating ongoing communication between the central bank and the government. Focus on Broader Economy: The discussions centered on the overall economic landscape and recent financial developments, suggesting a comprehensive review rather than a narrow focus on interest rate policy. G20 Preparation: The timing of the meeting, ahead of the G20 summit, highlights the importance of international coordination and Japan’s role in global economic discussions. No Rate Talk: Most importantly, Ueda firmly stated that long-term rates were not a topic of discussion during this particular meeting, directly countering speculation of immediate policy changes. Japanese Yen’s Reaction: A Sign of Market Relief? The Japanese Yen reacted notably to Ueda’s comments, sticking to strong intraday gains. This market behavior suggests that Ueda’s clarification may have tempered hawkish expectations that had been building up around the BoJ. The Yen’s strength reflects a complex interplay of factors, including: Hawkish BoJ Expectations: Prior to Ueda’s statement, there were growing expectations of a more hawkish stance from the BoJ, fueled by comments from board member Takata and market analysis suggesting higher terminal rates in the future. Yield Curve Control Speculation: Market participants have been closely watching for any signals that the BoJ might adjust or abandon its yield curve control policy, which directly impacts long-term rates . Global Market Sentiment: Broader global market sentiment and risk appetite also influence the Yen’s performance, as it is often considered a safe-haven currency. The Yen’s resilience despite Ueda’s denial could indicate underlying strength driven by factors beyond immediate rate hike expectations. However, it’s crucial to remember that market sentiment can shift rapidly based on new information and evolving economic data. What Does This Mean for BoJ Interest Rates and Future Policy? While Ueda’s statement clarifies the immediate context of his meeting with PM Ishiba, it doesn’t negate the broader discussion around the future trajectory of BoJ interest rates . Several factors suggest that the pressure on the BoJ to eventually normalize its policy remains: Factor Implication for BoJ Policy Inflationary Pressures: While Japan has historically struggled with deflation, recent global inflationary trends and domestic cost-push inflation are creating pressure on the BoJ to consider policy adjustments. Global Central Bank Actions: Most major central banks worldwide have been tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. The BoJ remains an outlier with its ultra-loose policy, creating potential distortions and pressures. Yen Weakness: Persistent Yen weakness can lead to imported inflation and potentially destabilize the economy. Adjusting BoJ interest rates could be a tool to manage Yen volatility. Market Expectations: Despite Ueda’s recent comments, market expectations for future BoJ policy normalization remain elevated. This anticipation itself can influence market behavior and economic conditions. Therefore, while immediate discussions might not be focused on long-term rates , the underlying pressures for the BoJ to eventually adjust its policy stance are undeniable. The timing and pace of any such adjustments, however, remain highly uncertain and data-dependent. Navigating the Forex Market: Key Insights for Traders For those active in the Forex and crypto markets, understanding the BoJ’s nuanced communication is vital. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor BoJ Communications: Pay close attention to statements from Governor Ueda and other BoJ officials. Nuance in their language can offer clues about policy direction. Track Yen Movements: The Japanese Yen will likely remain sensitive to BoJ-related news and global risk sentiment. Sudden Yen movements can present trading opportunities, but also risks. Consider Global Context: BoJ policy decisions are not made in isolation. Global economic trends, actions by other central banks, and geopolitical events all play a role. Manage Risk: The Forex market is inherently volatile. Always employ robust risk management strategies, especially when trading Yen pairs, which can be influenced by surprise BoJ announcements. In conclusion, Governor Ueda’s recent statement provides clarity on a specific meeting but doesn’t fundamentally alter the broader outlook for BoJ interest rates . The market remains keenly attuned to any signals from the BoJ, and the Japanese Yen will continue to be a closely watched currency in the global financial landscape.

In a new post on the social media platform X, Young Ju outlines BTC’s current price dynamics. “Bitcoin Cost Basis at $95,000: • ETFs/Custody Wallets: $89,000 • Binance Traders: $59,000 • Mining Companies: $57,000 – Falling below this level in past downturns (May 2022, March 2020, November 2018) confirmed a bear market. • Old Whales: $25,000 – Never breached historically.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X The CryptoQuant CEO also notes that MicroStrategy’s BTC cost basis is currently $65,033. The firm holds $45.91 billion worth of Bitcoin at time of writing, the largest corporate BTC treasury in the world, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net . Young Ju says Bitcoin’s price range “seems broad” in 2025, but he doesn’t think it will officially switch into a bear market. “I personally think that the bull cycle could continue even with a -30% dip from all-time high (e.g., $110,000 ? $77,000), as seen in past cycles.” BTC is trading at $95,930 at time of writing.

The prediction made by WEF in its 2015 report titled “Deep Shift: Technology Tipping Points and Societal Impact”, says that by 2027, over 10% of the world’s GDP valued at $10 trillion will be stored on the Blockchain networks. Market Reaction and the growing RWAs industry The native token of MANTRA, $OM has witnessed a decline of around 2.46% on the last 24 hours. However, it is worth noting that the token has rallied by 29x in the past year, according to data from IntotheBlock. And now with the launch of RWAccelerator and the new partnerships and initiatives that it has been coming up consistently, the token is bound to receive utility boost in the near future. With the global tokenization market projected to grow at CAGR of 19%, to reach $5.6 billion by 2026, the RWA industry is experiencing rapid growth with numerous startups emerging on the landscape. Few examples include Fraktion , Rally, Brickken, Abu Dhabi-based Realize, and Nigeria-based TrendX, among others. Therefore, this initiative of MANTRA can further accelerate the development of new tokenized financial products and bring more assets on-chain.

While there’s some good news – inflation has indeed decreased – Goolsbee’s latest statement emphasizes a crucial point: it’s still alarmingly high. This article breaks down Goolsbee’s remarks, what they mean for interest rates , the US Dollar , and consequently, the volatile crypto landscape. Why is the Federal Reserve Still Concerned About Inflation? Despite signs that inflationary pressures are easing, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee stated on Wednesday that inflation, while decreased, remains ‘excessive’. This assessment is critical because it shapes the Fed’s monetary policy, directly impacting the global financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. Goolsbee highlighted a key relationship: only after inflation convincingly falls can interest rates be adjusted downwards. This cautious approach signals that the era of high interest rates might persist longer than some market participants anticipate. Let’s break down the key takeaways from Goolsbee’s statement: Inflation is down but not out: Goolsbee acknowledges the decrease in inflation but stresses it’s still above acceptable levels. This suggests the Fed isn’t ready to declare victory just yet. Rates to remain elevated: The implication is clear – to combat persistently high inflation , interest rates are likely to remain at their current levels, or potentially even increase further if inflation doesn’t subside as expected. Dollar Impact: Higher interest rates generally strengthen the US Dollar , influencing global currency valuations and potentially impacting cryptocurrency trading pairs against USD. Decoding the Fed’s Mandate: How Does it Affect the US Dollar and Crypto? To understand the full impact of Goolsbee’s comments, it’s essential to grasp the Federal Reserve’s core functions. The Fed operates with a dual mandate: price stability and full employment. Their primary tool to achieve these is manipulating interest rates . Here’s a simplified explanation: Scenario Fed Action Impact on US Dollar Potential Crypto Market Reaction Inflation is too high (>2% target) Raises interest rates USD strengthens Potential downward pressure on crypto prices (especially when paired against USD) as investors may favor less risky USD assets. Inflation is too low ( Lowers interest rates USD weakens Potential upward pressure on crypto prices as a weaker USD and lower returns on traditional assets might drive investors towards riskier assets like crypto. Understanding Fed Tools: Quantitative Easing (QE) and Quantitative Tightening (QT) Beyond interest rates, the Federal Reserve has other powerful tools at its disposal, notably Quantitative Easing (QE) and Quantitative Tightening (QT). These measures significantly influence the US Dollar and broader market liquidity, which indirectly affects cryptocurrency markets. Quantitative Easing (QE): Injecting Liquidity QE is a non-standard policy used in crises or when inflation is exceptionally low. It involves the Fed injecting money into the financial system by purchasing assets like government bonds. Think of it as the Fed ‘printing money’ to stimulate the economy. Goal: Increase credit flow and lower long-term interest rates during economic downturns. Impact on USD: QE typically weakens the US Dollar as it increases the supply of dollars in the market. Crypto Market Implication: A weaker dollar can sometimes be beneficial for crypto, as it can make dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin more attractive to international investors. Quantitative Tightening (QT): Reducing Liquidity Quantitative Tightening (QT) is the opposite of QE. It’s when the Federal Reserve reduces its balance sheet by stopping bond purchases and allowing maturing bonds to roll off without reinvesting. This effectively withdraws liquidity from the market. Goal: Curb inflation by reducing the money supply and increasing borrowing costs. Impact on USD: QT usually strengthens the US Dollar as it reduces the dollar supply and can lead to higher interest rates. Crypto Market Implication: A stronger dollar and tighter financial conditions can create headwinds for crypto markets, potentially leading to decreased investment and price corrections. Goolsbee’s Stance and Market Reaction: What to Expect Next? Austan Goolsbee’s emphasis on persistently high inflation suggests the Federal Reserve is unlikely to pivot to a dovish stance anytime soon. The market reaction on Wednesday, with the US Dollar Index (DXY) slightly decreasing, might seem counterintuitive at first glance. However, this could reflect a market already pricing in a hawkish Fed stance, or reacting to other factors influencing the dollar on that particular day. For cryptocurrency investors, Goolsbee’s comments serve as a stark reminder that macroeconomic factors, particularly Federal Reserve policy and inflation trends, are crucial determinants of market direction. Monitoring Fed communications and economic data releases remains paramount for navigating the crypto space. Navigating the Crypto Market in an Era of Persistent Inflation In conclusion, while the decrease in inflation is a positive development, Austan Goolsbee’s remarks highlight that the battle against excessive price increases is far from over. This implies a continued environment of potentially higher interest rates and a stronger US Dollar , factors that can influence cryptocurrency market dynamics. Investors should remain vigilant, conduct thorough research, and understand the interplay between macroeconomic forces and digital assets to make informed decisions in these times.

Imagine a technology that could break down communication barriers instantly, making every voice heard and understood. That’s the promise of Sanas, an innovative startup leveraging AI to transform how we communicate in call centers and beyond. Let’s dive into how Sanas is using voice AI to address accent bias and just secured a massive $65 million funding round to fuel its ambitious vision. Why is Voice and Speech Recognition Exploding? The demand for voice AI and speech recognition technologies isn’t just a trend; it’s a seismic shift in how we interact with technology and each other. Market research indicates a staggering growth trajectory, projecting the sector to be worth over $28.1 billion by 2027. This surge is driven by: Increased Automation: Businesses are constantly seeking ways to streamline operations and enhance customer service, and voice recognition offers powerful automation capabilities. Hands-Free Convenience: From smart speakers to in-car assistants, voice interfaces are becoming integral to daily life, offering unparalleled convenience. Accessibility: Voice technology opens doors for users with disabilities, providing alternative and intuitive ways to interact with devices and services. Global Communication Needs: As businesses expand internationally, the need to overcome language and accent barriers becomes increasingly critical. Amidst this booming landscape, Sanas emerges as a standout player, carving a unique niche with its groundbreaking approach to accent modification. Sanas: Pioneering AI-Driven Accent Modification in Real-Time Founded in 2020, Sanas is not just another AI company; it’s a mission-driven organization aiming to foster more inclusive and effective communication. Their core technology uses AI to intelligently adjust a speaker’s accent in real-time. Sharath Keshava Narayana, Sanas’ co-founder and president, emphasizes their human-centric approach: “At Sanas, we believe that while technology is transforming the industry, it shouldn’t replace human connection, but rather, enhance it. With the number of customer interactions continuing to scale globally, the need for human-to-human communication remains critical.” The genesis of Sanas is rooted in a deeply personal experience. Co-founders Maxim Serebryakov, Shawn Zhang, and Andrés Soderi were inspired by a friend’s struggles with accent discrimination in a call center . Narayana explains, “Max and Shawn’s friend, Raul, who had to return to Nicaragua to support his family, faced accent discrimination at his call center job. His experience with ‘accent neutralization training’ and the toll it took on him inspired Max and Shawn to build a solution to reduce accent bias.” How Does Sanas’s Accent Modification Technology Work? Sanas’s patented technology is at the heart of its innovation. It analyzes speech patterns and, in real-time, outputs converted speech that aligns with a desired accent . The company highlights several key features that set it apart: Accent Adjustment: Modifies accents to improve clarity and understanding in communication. Emotion and Identity Preservation: Maintains the speaker’s original emotion and unique vocal identity. Noise Reduction: Minimizes reverb, echo, and background noise for enhanced audio quality. Patented AI Technologies: Utilizes proprietary AI that recognizes and adjusts phonetic patterns instantly. Extensive Training Data: AI models are trained on over 50 million utterances, using diverse datasets from technology partners and in-house voice actors. The recent acquisition of competitor InTone further strengthens Sanas’s intellectual property and expands its reach in the market, positioning it to serve an even broader customer base. Real-World Impact: Who is Using Sanas? Today, Sanas boasts around 50 customers across diverse industries, including: Healthcare Logistics Hardware Manufacturing Narayana reports impressive financial growth, with annual recurring revenue reaching $21 million, a $3 million increase from the previous year. This growth underscores the tangible value Sanas brings to its clients by improving communication efficiency and customer satisfaction in call center environments and beyond. Addressing the Controversy: Is Accent Modification Ethical? Sanas operates in a space that sparks debate. Some research suggests that exposure to diverse accents can actually reduce bias. Critics, as highlighted in a 2022 profile by The Guardian, argue that solutions like Sanas risk homogenizing voices in call centers , potentially diminishing cultural diversity. Narayana counters these concerns by emphasizing Sanas’s core mission: “What makes Sanas special is not just the technology, but its deeply human mission to break barriers, reduce discrimination, and amplify voices across the globe. Together with my co-founders, we’re building a world where communication is a bridge — not a barrier.” He positions Sanas not as a tool for homogenization, but as a means to ensure clear communication and reduce bias stemming from accent perception, ultimately empowering individuals to be heard. $65 Million Funding: What’s Next for Sanas? Despite the ethical considerations, investors are clearly bullish on Sanas’s potential. The company recently announced a significant $65 million funding round, valuing it at over $500 million. This round was led by Quadrille Capital and Teleperformance, with participation from Insight Partners, Quiet Capital, Alorica, and DN Capital. Having raised over $100 million to date, Sanas has ambitious plans: Develop New Algorithms: Focusing on advanced “speech-to-speech” algorithms to further refine their technology. Geographic Expansion: Expanding into new regions to serve a global clientele. Industry Diversification: Exploring opportunities in healthcare, retail, and other sectors beyond traditional call centers . Team Growth: Expanding its team of approximately 150 professionals. New Office in the Philippines: Establishing a presence in the Philippines, a major hub for contact centers. Narayana confidently states, “With a clear focus on scaling responsibly and innovating continuously, Sanas is well-prepared to weather potential headwinds.” This significant funding injection will undoubtedly accelerate Sanas’s journey to redefine communication in a globalized world. Conclusion: The Future of Voice is Clearer Than Ever with AI Sanas is not just changing accents ; it’s challenging the status quo of global communication. By leveraging the power of AI , they are addressing real-world communication barriers and fostering inclusivity in the workplace. As voice AI continues to evolve, companies like Sanas are at the forefront, shaping a future where everyone can communicate clearly and confidently, regardless of their accent . The substantial funding and growing customer base signal a bright future for Sanas and its mission to make communication a universal bridge.

The commission appealed the ruling after U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor of the Northern District of Texas found that the SEC had “exceeded its statutory authority” with the rule. The policy, first finalized in February 2024, wanted to classify decentralized finance platforms, liquidity providers, and automated market makers with over $50 million in capital as dealers, subjecting them to registration requirements. O’Connor ruled that the SEC’s approach was “untethered” from U.S. securities law, siding with industry groups that challenged the regulation. The Blockchain Association and the Crypto Freedom Alliance of Texas argued the rule would impose unworkable compliance burdens on DeFi protocols, which lack central operators capable of enforcing Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering requirements.

She characterized the SEC’s broker-dealer rule as an “unlawful power grab” that attempted to redefine the agency’s statutory authority without proper justification. The SEC’s retreat on the broker-dealer rule is just the latest sign of shifting tides in Washington’s approach to crypto. With Gensler out of the picture, the agency has undergone a major course correction under new leadership. President Donald Trump wasted no time shaking things up and refocusing the SEC away from aggressive crypto crackdowns. Acting Chair Mark Uyeda has since been steering the agency toward a more measured approach, dialing back litigation efforts that defined Gensler’s tenure. And the broker-dealer rule isn’t the only enforcement push getting the cold shoulder—several high-profile cases against prominent crypto firms like Binance and Coinbase have now been put on pause .

Since “their respective peaks,” major memecoins like $DOGE, $PEPE, $BONK, and $WIF have seen “sharp declines in futures contracts.” This suggests that market participants are unwinding leveraged futures positions and reassessing their exposure to these highly speculative assets. A number of trends indicate that investor sentiment is shifting here. Some of these trends are frankly amusing. A Steep Decline Across Multiple Memecoins The total value of open contracts for a specific asset is referred to as futures OI. It is noteworthy that the memecoin domain has seen a sharp decrease in OI. For $DOGE, the chief memecoin by market capitalization, the 7-day moving average of futures OI has tumbled by an incredible 58.45%. From a high of $3.58 billion on December 9, 2024, $DOGE’s futures OI has dived down to $1.49 billion as of today. This significant drop seems to indicate an unwinding of speculative activity that had been centered around the memecoin, with investors liquidating their positions and moving to cash. In the same way, other well-known memecoins have also followed this path and have experienced the same type of deleveraging. $PEPE, which had received a good deal of attention in 2024, watched its futures OI plummet by an unbelievable 71.93%, from $1.25 billion to $351 million. This steep drop reflects the pattern of traders moving away from leverage and is indicative of the sort of pullback that happens when an initial speculative frenzy burns out. $BONK, yet another memecoin that saw huge speculation earlier in the year, was not spared. Its futures OI dropped by an incredible 75.10%, going from $715 million to $178 million. Another lesser-known memecoin, $WIF, also saw a tremendous drop when it came to OI—69.83%, going from $653 million to $197 million. These sharp corrections really do point to a cooling of sorts in the overall market as traders step down from the highs of 2021 and reassess the leveraged conditions they had built up in both the long and short directions. Smaller Memecoins Feel the Pressure The larger memecoins such as $DOGE, $PEPE, $BONK, and $WIF have not affected the trend of decreasing open interest in the futures market for smaller tokens in the sector. $SHIB and $FLOKI, less prominent but still known, saw their futures open interests decline sharply. $SHIB, at one point the most hyped memecoin, saw its futures open interest drop 74.41%, from $323 million to $83 million. $FLOKI, while not even close to the same level of notoriety as $SHIB, saw a 69% decline in its OI, dropping from $41.7 million to $12.9 million. This pattern in the memecoin sector underscores a larger trend: Tokens that were once buzzing with activity are now having trouble holding even a low level of speculative interest. The token’s massive plummet in open interest, or OI, signals a dramatic shift in sentiment within the memecoin market. Investors who were once fueling the fiendishly speculative frenzy surrounding these assets may now be pulling back, either because they’re cashing out their profits or because they’re starting to be concerned about the long-term sustainability of these supposedly “meme”-worthy tokens. Futures Open Interest across memecoins sector has dropped significantly since their peaks. $DOGE 's Futures OI 7D moving average saw a 58.45% decline, falling from $3.58B on Dec 9, 2024, to $1.49B today: https://t.co/5yBcLzcXMA How do other memecoins compare? Let’s dive in pic.twitter.com/oIKRmQdsBx — glassnode (@glassnode) February 19, 2025 A Sign of Leverage Flushing Out The sharp decrease in futures open interest across many memecoins suggests that a deleveraging process is taking place. In financial markets, deleveraging refers to the process of paying back debt and reducing the use of borrowed money to finance investments. It usually occurs when a decline in the value of an asset or an increase in risk makes it clear that too many people have been investing with too much borrowed money. Memecoin investors hoping to profit from price increases have almost certainly been one group using futures accounts to invest with leverage. The winding down of this deleveraging process has probably now reached memecoins. This reduction in leverage could also be an early sign that the speculative boom in the memecoin sector is coming to an end. As prices for these tokens have come down and with a reduction in traders taking on leveraged bets in the sector, it now seems to be the case that the once very frothy memecoin market is starting to settle down. What Does the Future Hold for Memecoins? The sector of memecoins has shown extreme volatility. They are often worth very little, and their value is frequently driven more by sentiment and speculation than by any real fundamentals. Some memecoins, like $DOGE, have long-standing followings and are more integrated into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Others, like $PEPE, $BONK, and $WIF, are prone to the whims of short-term traders. The future of the even fewer memecoins with some real utility seems hardly a sure bet. The decline in futures OI across these tokens could mean a drawn-out consolidation period for the sector. Traders seem to be stepping back, which normally would mean less price volatility and fewer large price swings that are attractive to speculators. But while futures markets have been relatively quiet lately, Tornado Cash has been in the news. And that could make the next 48 hours or so quite interesting for anyone with spec positions in the tokens listed above. To conclude, a significant decrease in futures open interest in the memecoin sector has occurred, and this reflects a wider unwinding of speculation and a shift in sentiment. Currently, traders are exercising more caution. They are likely waiting for better market conditions to re-enter the memecoin space. The future of these tokens is hazy, but right now, the spaces where they trade in have cooled off considerably. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This strategy was seen in the Coinbase case , where the Commission requested a deadline extension. However, it has yet to formally drop its most high-profile cases. Under Gary Gensler, the SEC pursued legal action against Ripple, Kraken, and other crypto firms. Now, as leadership changes, the agency appears less aggressive. The Ripple lawsuit, filed in December 2020, remains one of the most significant legal battles in the crypto sector. With an important April 16 court deadline, many speculate that the SEC might be reconsidering its stance. According to reports from Capitol Hill, the Commission is prioritizing cases with imminent deadlines. “I’m told by multiple legal sources that the SEC has been focusing on cases with closer court deadlines, which might explain why we haven’t seen delay requests for the Ripple and Kraken lawsuits,” said journalist Eleanor Terrett. While the SEC requested a 30-day extension in its battle with Coinbase, no such move has been made in the Ripple case. The Commission has shown a willingness to drop smaller legal battles, but the XRP case has broader implications for U.S. crypto regulation. This means the agency might be hesitant to withdraw from it completely. However, by April, several changes at the SEC could allow more flexibility in handling the Ripple lawsuit. The current Acting Chair, Mark Uyeda, is temporarily leading the Commission, and Paul Atkins is still awaiting Senate confirmation. If Atkins is formally approved, he could have the authority to make major decisions, including dropping the case. Additionally, Congress recently formed its first Crypto Subcommittee , which is investigating regulatory overreach. If the findings support the idea that the SEC overstepped its jurisdiction in the Ripple case, it could pressure the agency to reconsider. More significantly, President Trump may intervene. The Department of Government Oversight (D.O.G.E.) is already planning an investigation into SEC enforcement, and it operates under executive branch authority. Last night, Trump escalated his policies, signing an executive order to establish direct federal oversight over regulatory agencies like the SEC and FTC. If implemented by April, this order could give the White House the power to compel the SEC to drop the Ripple lawsuit entirely. “So-called independent agencies like the FTC and SEC have exercised enormous power over the American people without Presidential oversight. These agencies issue rules that cost billions of dollars and impact major policy issues. Now, they will no longer be able to impose rules without accountability,” Trump’s statement read. This executive order has sparked intense debate. It centralizes federal power, and legal experts believe the Supreme Court may strike it down. However, it highlights how many different ways Trump could reshape U.S. crypto regulation. The SEC that first sued Ripple is no longer the same agency. While it hasn’t yet dropped the case, the shifting political and legal landscape may soon force a different outcome.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|EXCHANGE|DOGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-20 09:09:19

He noted that 98% of investors would sell their tokens between $10 and $50, but revealed that he would hold his XRP till it crosses $100. He affirmed his confidence in the digital asset and asked the community members if they would replicate it. 98% of the people will sell their #XRP after $10-$50. I am here to see the price above $100. Who will stay with me? — XRP Avengers (@XRP_Avengers) February 19, 2025 Price Expectations Among XRP Holders His statement drew responses from numerous investors who shared even more ambitious targets. Some community members indicated they would hold until XRP reached several hundred dollars, while others set their targets in the thousands. One respondent stated he would sell “at $44” while using the remaining XRP to build a company focused on tokenizing assets on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Another investor declared , “We the fearless will hold above $100.” Notably, analysts have also set high expectations. Dark Defender, a well-respected crypto analyst, has declared that he will not sell his XRP until it reaches $333 . Others set even higher targets. One participant said , “I’m here for 1k,” while another predicted a rise above $5,000. Some even suggested XRP reaching five-figure valuations, with one holder saying , “I know I sound like a broken record, but I’m here for 10k+.” A Divide Between Traders and Long-Term Holders Some responses highlight a divide in the XRP community. Some investors plan to take profits at specific price points, while others are committed to holding for potential long-term growth. One individual noted that he would “take profits at 100,” but most of his holdings would remain until XRP reached significantly higher valuations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another stated , “Holding strong. Let’s see xrp reach its full potential,” suggesting that he has no intention to sell. This difference in strategies reflects broader debates within the cryptocurrency market. While some traders aim to capitalize on short-term gains, others believe in the long-term potential of blockchain technology and the XRPL’s role in financial systems. What’s Next For XRP? While many in the community hold differing opinions, the majority are confident that XRP is going up, and recent developments in the crypto space support that belief. The Ripple lawsuit, the major suppressor of the asset’s price, is about to end. The SEC is moving away from its aggressive regulatory strategy, and the regulator’s recent actions have convinced a former SEC Director that it will soon drop the lawsuit against Ripple . This move would finally unlock the asset’s potential, and it could hit the four or even five-digit targets predicted by community members.

40578774,https://nulltx.com/?p=145299,1740042697,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"FTX Begins Paying Small Claims, with Bigger Payments Scheduled for 2025",https://nulltx.com/ftx-begins-paying-small-claims-with-bigger-payments-scheduled-for-2025/,"In late 2022, the cryptocurrency exchange FTX , which had collapsed, commenced a process of significant financial recovery for those affected by its failure and began to make partial repayments to its creditors. Sunil, who is an FTX creditor, took to Twitter recently to talk about the repayments. He revealed that FTX has thus far paid out $800 million to 162,000 accounts. These partial repaymentsaree being made to customers with the smallest claims, as is common practice in bankruptcy proceedings. A total of $1.2 billion has been set aside for these payments. The Current Round of Payments FTX’s initial repayment round concentrates on paying back smaller creditors with claims under $50,000. Per Sunil’s tweet, around $800 million has already been doled out to about 162,000 accounts, which makes up about 35% of the estimated 460,000 accounts eligible for repayment. When it comes to how the money was allocated, it’s been reported that 50% of it was sent directly to the original account holders, with an equal amount going to debt acquirers, who purchased the claims from the original holders. Paying off these small creditors is a crucial first step to make things right after the FTX bankruptcy, which left many investors and users in dire straits. FTX creditor Sunil said that FTX started paying small claims to creditors today, involving accounts with claims of less than $50,000. The total amount of this round of repayments is $1.2 billion, and about $800 million has been paid so far, covering about 162,000 accounts,… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 18, 2025 The repayments come after months of legal and logistical delays following FTX’s bankruptcy declaration in November 2022. Individual users and institutional investors who constitute FTX’s creditor base have long sought some form of payback following the collapse of the exchange, which led to “real and lasting harm” amounting to billions of dollars. While these repayments are certainly a positive step, they are part of a plan that, by most accounts, has a long way to go before it is fully implemented. Looking Ahead to 2025: Upcoming Payment Dates As the initial payment is made to creditors owed less than $50,000, Sunil also gave some important details about how and when FTX will be paying back its larger creditors. Our next distribution goes to the record date of April 11, 2025, and that’s significant for a couple of reasons: Creditor claims above $50,000 will be in abundance, but the larger pieces of that puzzle—both individual and institutional—that are owed $50,000 and above will also be waiting in the wings. FTX creditor Sunil tweeted that the record date for the next distribution is set for April 11, 2025, with distribution expected to begin on May 30, 2025. The distribution will cover claims over $50,000, as well as approved claims under $50,000 that did not receive payment in the… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 18, 2025 The next round of distributions for FTX is set to take place on May 30, 2025. This round will pay out claims in excess of $50,000, as well as any claims under $50,000 that did not get paid in the initial distribution but were deemed as legally collectible by FTX. If you’re a creditor with a claim still left hanging, make sure to double-check your status and the approval of your claim before the record date for the May 30 distribution. FTX Distribution Dates 11 April 2025: Distribution Record Date Claims > $50k 30 May 2025: Next Distribution Date Claims > $50K Claims — Sunil (FTX Creditor Champion) (@sunil_trades) February 18, 2025 An essential detail to note is that the April 2025 distribution will also encompass earlier disputed claims that fall under the $50,000 threshold. If a claim was contested or in dispute before the initial record date, it’s now eligible for repayment as long as it was approved by the appeals court after the fact. This means that a number of creditors, especially those with smaller claims that were initially disputed, stand to receive a second slice of the pie in 2025 when those funds are finally distributed. Ongoing Challenges in the FTX Bankruptcy Process FTX’s process of paying back its creditors has not been without obstacles. The bankruptcy proceedings for the one-time giant exchange have been tied up in legal disputes, asset sales, and the hunt for missing money. FTX’s lawyers have been working with the courts to sort things out, but many of the problems relate to the vast number of people and the amount of money owed that were involved with FTX. Besides the payments to creditors, ongoing investigations look into the actions of former executives—such as founder Sam Bankman-Fried—who is now facing several criminal charges connected with the exchange’s collapse. These probes, and the court proceedings they generate, have further delayed the distribution process but seem necessary for a full accounting of what happened. These challenges notwithstanding, the recently resumed repayments by FTX give reason for hope to the creditors who have watched and waited for over a year. They were once told by collapsed Harbinger Capital that the situation was so bad that “there was little chance of recovery for FTX’s 1 million creditors.” Hearing anything positive coming from FTX’s executive offices was almost an impossibility. A Long Road to Full Recovery The road to complete repayment is still pretty murky for a lot of creditors, particularly those with high-value claims. Barring any development of this year’s remaining legal proceedings or asset sale efforts, the bulk of repayments won’t likely happen until 2026 or later. Patience will be a necessary virtue for creditors as they await the next stage of this unfolding story. FTX’s continuing Chapter 11 bankruptcy serves as a warning for the largely unregulated cryptocurrency industry, underscoring the need for effective oversight and clear operation. In the cautionary tale that has emerged since November, we have seen one failed platform attempt to drag down several others in the crypto space. We have also seen, under bankruptcy court supervision, the realization of some $1 billion in losses by the platform’s customers, who hazily thought they were not operating in a fund that was effectively a Ponzi scheme—because under the right circumstances, it could have been a profitable platform. With the resolution of its financial obligations to creditors continuing and more repayments now made, FTX remains several years away from fully discharging its debts. The next, and probably largest, payment to creditors won’t happen until 2025. That delays neither means that RBS is in any less of a hurry to conclude the case nor that creditors are any less eager to see the FTX bankruptcy brought to a finish. At present, creditors and interested parties will keep an eye on the developing situation, with bated breath and crossed fingers, awaiting the next payment installment due in spring 2025. While the distribution process is ongoing and any final resolution is still far over the horizon, the outcome is of course of vital interest to anyone involved in the case. Payments to anyone with a claim against FTX will be thoroughly dissected and studied. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

According to local media CoinPost , the FSA has approved a a report from a working group recommending policy changes that, if implemented, would ease crypto regulations related to stablecoins and brokerage in the Japan . The proposed amendments impact two main payment-related laws in the country, the Trust Business Act and the Payment Services Act, as cryptocurrency is still classified as digital payment tools under the local regulations. After receiving criticism from local crypto firms that say Japan’s crypto regulations are too strict, the government now aims to make it easier for businesses to handle crypto assets. One of the policy changes include a reform that would allow stablecoins to be backed by short-term government bonds and fixed-term deposits in addition to demand deposits. The working group also recommended an upper limit of 50% on the bonds and deposits that can be used as collateral for stabelcoins.

However, the report mentioned that more mechanisms may be needed to ensure user protection. Additionally, the working group’s proposal suggested the government should create a new category for “intermediary” crypto businesses or brokerages. Under the current law, firms that only act as brokers in the exchange of crypto assets are expected to complete the same registration requirements as crypto exchange platforms operating in Japan. This means that even crypto brokerages need to apply for a virtual asset service provider license, just like domestic crypto exchanges. Under the new recommendation, intermediaries would be subject to their own requirements and anti-money laundering obligations. The report stated that this regulatory change is expected to make it easier for crypto firms to enter the Japanese market. Earlier this month, the Japanese FSA declared it was considering changing how cryptocurrencies are classified under Japanese law. The financial watchdog plans to classify them as financial products, similar to securities rather than payment tools. The final decision will reportedly be announced in June 2025.

This campaign is being spread through totally legit-looking ads that claim there is a “Jupiter Exchange exploit” and try to get people to paste malicious JavaScript (JS) code into their console. This is the kind of thing that could happen to anyone, and what makes it a total bummer is that the action required to complete the hack doesn’t even feel like an act of hacking. You are, of course, hacking yourself, but the whole scenario is set up to have you feel super-duper secure while you do it. The latest phishing scheme aimed at Jupiter users shows just how far malicious actors will go to exploit weaknesses in user security. As we continue to migrate toward a future with decentralized exchanges and platforms, the number of bad actors looking to capitalize on that new frontier grows right along with it. And right now, thanks to a few recent news stories, we know that Jupiter is not a safe haven for those who venture forth into the world of DeFi. How the Scam Works The deceitful operation employs a top-notch and tricky method to lure users into taking part in their assault. This is how the con generally plays out: 1. Ads and Fake Bug Reports that Deceive: The attackers inundated various online platforms with false promises and claims about a security exploit on the Jupiter Exchange. The ads tell users that the exchange has a problem and that they need to take specific actions to protect their assets or fix a bug that the exchange supposedly has. However, there’s no problem with the exchange. These ads are just part of a malicious campaign to trick users into handing over their private keys. 2. JS Code That Causes Harm: The fraudsters direct people to dishonest “bug report” repositories to beg them to copy and paste JavaScript code into their browser consoles. They present this as a supposedly harmless action that will help resolve an ongoing issue with the exchange. In reality, the issue isn’t with the exchange itself but with the users who have been foolish enough to take the advice of scammers and use the provided code. The action of pasting the code into a console connects the user’s browser to the scammers’ malicious API. 3. Using a Malicious API to Access and Drain a Crypto Wallet: The malicious API (solapi[.]network) is what is doing most of the heavy lifting in this theft of crypto. This is an API that the attacker has set up to use the user’s web browser to make as many unauthorized transactions as possible after the legitimate user has granted access to the API by running the malicious code provided in the pasted message. 4. Total Wallet Emptying: Once the user’s wallet is under the control of the malicious code, it can remove assets from the wallet with no user indication or warning. Fund drainers that work in the DeFi space take advantage of the lack of security in certain DeFi protocols to remove tokens from user wallets at the same time that the user is engaging with a protocol in a totally normal manner. 1/3 WARNING: Active Phishing Campaign Targeting Jupiter Users Fake ""Jupiter Exchange exploit"" claims are circulating via ads. Scammers urge users to paste malicious code into browser consoles, leading to complete wallet drain. https://t.co/NVCn1M4XWr pic.twitter.com/QtXlWvOFqR — Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) February 19, 2025 The Dangers of Using Untrusted Code This phishing campaign underscores the danger associated with handling potentially untrusted code or links, even when they seem to originate from a wholly reliable source. The people who interact with these kinds of “cloned” protocols, as well as those who interact with the kinds of sites that can be accessed through the links you’re given in the fake console message, are at genuine risk of having their assets stolen. And honestly, all you have to do is make a single mistake in any part of that harmless-seeming process, and you’re done for. Crypto frauds like this frequently depend on users not knowing enough about the inner workings of their wallets and exchanges. Even though the majority of crypto platforms take serious, commendable steps to shore up the security of their services, nothing can match the security that comes from users just paying attention. And because the stakes are higher for everyone now, more attention is obviously a good thing. How to Protect Yourself Although phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated and appear to be everywhere, there are some fundamental actions that users can take to defend themselves. 1. Do Not Engage with Unsound Advertisements or Links: Always exercise caution with unexpected advertisements or pop-up messages that vow to resolve problems you’re having with a platform. Legitimate trading platforms and protocols never, I repeat, never, ask users to copy and paste code into their browser console. If an ad or a message seems to offer a solution and looks like it was designed by a friendly robot, don’t believe it. 2. Verify the Code’s Origin: Do not copy JavaScript code from unfamiliar or suspicious repositories. Confirm that the source is credible and vetted before inserting anything into your browser console. When in doubt, lean on dependable online communities and forums for reassurance about the safety of the code in question. 3. Employ Hardware Wallets: A hardware wallet is one of the most effective asset protectors available. These devices store the private keys necessary to access your funds offline. This massively reduces the risk of online attacks, and even if a hacker were to somehow infiltrate your home, they would need to steal the device to access your funds. 4. Confirm Updates from Platforms: When exchanges or platforms have problems, always check with official sources to see what’s going on. Any legitimate bugs or problems will be reported clearly through the official channels of the platform, like its website or verified social media accounts. 5. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Although this does not directly stop phishing assaults, enabling 2FA can help safeguard your accounts by adding an additional layer of security. Even if an assault is directed at you and your credentials are obtained, your funds remain safer if 2FA is turned on. Stay Informed: The threats in the cryptocurrency realm are constantly changing, and staying up to date on the latest scams and phishing techniques is a must. You should make it a point to regularly check community forums, news outlets you trust, and official sources for updates on potential threats to your investment. What Jupiter Users Need to Know Being a user of Jupiter Exchange, it is vital to stay on guard against phishing attempts. The attackers behind this scheme aren’t just going after your personal information; they’re preying on your very real concerns about the safety and reliability of the exchange. They’re counting on the fact that when you see a message like, “Your account may be compromised. Click here for immediate resolution,” you’re going to be tempted to do just that. The best defense against becoming a victim of this or any similar scheme is knowing how it works and why it doesn’t work for the scammers when you understand those principles. If you think that your wallet has been compromised as a result of this phishing attack or some other con, it is absolutely essential that you act without delay. Move any still accessible funds to a wallet that is secure, and report what has happened to the pertinent authorities and platforms. Doing this can help stop the scammers from succeeding with any further attacks. The phishing campaign that is directing its efforts toward the users of the Jupiter Exchange is a potent reminder that the digital economy, and particularly the world of cryptocurrency, can be a very dangerous place. But as I outlined in my previous piece on this same topic, there are definitely some best practices that you can follow which, while not guaranteeing your safety, can make you a much harder target for the kinds of malicious actors who might trying to work their way into your digital wallet.

Binance could be the next major exchange to list the asset, as a community vote running until February 27 shows strong support, with over 85% of participants voting “Yes.” The Major Milestone Almost six years after its birth, Pi Network finally saw the launch of its Open Network. The initiative made the PI token publicly accessible and allowed exchanges to list it. Bitget , OKX , and MEXC were among the first to embrace it. Currently, the price of PI varies on each platform: traders can buy it for roughly $1.72 on OKX, $1.69 on Bitget, and $1.68 on MEXC. Prior to the listing, many industry participants made interesting price predictions. Some suggested PI will be worth mere cents on launch day, while others forecasted much higher levels. It is worth mentioning that the biggest optimists envisioned $314.159 (a number symbolically linked to π (Pi) ≈ 3.14159) as a possible target. Such a price, though, would require the asset’s market capitalization to explode above $30 trillion, making the prediction quite ridiculous (to say the least). Binance to Jump on Board? Besides the aforementioned exchanges that have already supported PI, many others have been rumored to hop on the bandwagon soon. One of those is the world’s biggest – Binance. It remained silent on the matter for several days before issuing a community vote on February 17 that should decide whether the token will be embraced . “We have been listening to the vibrant discussions within our community about Pi Network. To ensure users’ voices are heard , Binance is launching a Community Vote. We invite users to participate and share their opinions on the topic: “Should PI be launched on Binance?” under the official post on Binance Square Official,” the announcement reads. The firm said the voting period will run until February 27 , and only verified users who hold a minimum of 5 USD equivalent assets in their exchange accounts can participate. As of this writing, over 85% of the voters have picked the “Yes” option.

Despite federal court rulings blocking his spending freezes, his administration has found a way around them. Instead of openly defying the courts, Trump’s team has placed political appointees inside government agencies, instructing them to pause spending under different legal justifications. The result? The money remains locked up while the administration claims it’s complying with court orders. Trump’s appointees keep USAID funds frozen through technicalities Pete Marocco, a Trump appointee leading efforts to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), filed a declaration in a federal court in Washington confirming how the strategy works. Marocco admitted that USAID officials had been told to disregard Trump’s freeze order, but that didn’t mean the money started moving. The agency’s Phoenix payment system, which handles contracts and grants, remains nonfunctional, according to employees at USAID and the aid organizations relying on its funding. Humanitarian aid programs are still unable to process payments, and officials say the new system makes it even harder to release funds. According to Marocco, Trump’s team has created a new payment system with additional layers of approval. Every transaction now requires written proof from a senior official that the money aligns with administration policies. The review process ensures that each grant and contract is vetted before approval. “Payments will be released as they are processed,” Marocco said in his court filing. But the key detail? Trump’s order is no longer the reason for the freeze. Instead, agencies are invoking other legal authorities to keep the money tied up. These statutes were never blocked by the courts, which means the administration can still use them. Invoking that kind of loophole is not limited to the freeze on foreign aid spending. It has also arisen in litigation over an order by Mr. Trump’s Office of Management and Budget instructing agencies to halt as much as $3 trillion in domestic grants, loans, and contractual spending. Trump considers sending D.O.G.E savings to Americans While Trump’s team is busy blocking government spending, D.O.G.E is generating massive savings. On Wednesday, Trump revealed that he was considering sending 20% of those savings directly to American citizens. “There’s even under consideration a new concept where we give 20% of the D.O.G.E savings to American citizens, and 20% goes to paying down debt,” Trump said at the FII Priority Summit in Miami Beach, Florida. Trump’s comments came after Elon Musk posted on X (formerly Twitter) that he would “check with the President” about a proposal to issue tax refund checks funded by D.O.G.E savings. The idea was originally proposed by James Fishback, CEO of Azoria, a Miami-based investment firm. Fishback suggested Trump could distribute part of the cost savings from D.O.G.E as a “D.O.G.E Dividend”. Musk has publicly said his goal is to cut federal spending by $2 trillion out of a $6.75 trillion annual budget. If that goal is met, Fishback argues that 20% of the savings—$400 billion—should go back to taxpayers. According to Fishback’s calculations, that would mean a $5,000 check for every U.S. household. “When a breach of this magnitude happens in the private sector, the counterparty, at minimum, refunds the customer since they failed to deliver what was promised,” Fishback wrote in his proposal. “It’s high time for the federal government to do the same and refund money back to taxpayers given what D.O.G.E has uncovered.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",News|D.O.G.E,EN,0,0,DOGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-20 09:22:22

Here’s what this could mean for the ETH price. Ethereum Average Fees Has Gone Down Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the latest trend in the Average Fees of Ethereum. The “Average Fees” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the average amount of fees (in USD) that users on the ETH network are attaching with their transactions. Related Reading: How Close Is Bitcoin To A Bear Market? This Historical Level May Contain Hints This indicator’s value tends to be directly related to the activity that’s occurring on the network. When there is a high amount of traffic, the Average Fees can note an uptick. This is because the blockchain only has a limited capacity to handle transactions, so the validators prefer to process the transfers with the highest fees first. Users that don’t want to be stuck waiting in the mempool have no choice, but to pay a transfer fees that’s higher than the average. As senders compete against each other in this manner, the Average Fees can shoot up during a period of congestion. In times of little network activity, though, the metric can stay at low levels, as investors have no incentive to pay a high fee. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm, that shows the trend in the Ethereum Average Fees over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Average Fees has been in a state of decline recently, which implies the activity on the network has potentially been going down. Today, the metric is sitting at just $0.4088, which is the lowest that it has been since late August. While a high amount of activity is constructive during uptrends (since all of the users making trades is what provides the fuel to keep such moves going), low network fees may not be so bad while the market is already down. As Santiment explains, When users are not paying high prices to move their ETH or tokens, it is typically a good sign for mid-term and long-term price outlooks. These low fee levels often happen when prices are perceived as ‘low’ or ‘bearish’ according to traders. These reduced costs make it easier for new buyers to enter the market. Related Reading: Why Litecoin Won’t Break Out—Analytics Firm Reveals the Cause It now remains to be seen whether this low Average Fees period would lead to a fresh rebound for Ethereum, just like it did following the aforementioned low in August. ETH Price Ethereum has been locked in sideways movement since the crash around the start of the month as its price continues to trade around $2,700.

While DOGE recently pulled back to the 0.618 Fibonacci level , experts still aren’t sure about its long-term outlook. At the same time, a fresh XRP rival called Remittix (RTX) is catching attention as the next big blockchain-powered financial token. Dogecoin ’s Future in Doubt – Even With ETF Buzz Dogecoin’s price ups and downs have people wondering if it can stay steady or if it’s headed for a deeper dip. The SEC taking note of Grayscale’s DOGE ETF request gave some traders hope. In fact, analysts guess there’s about a 76% shot at the ETF getting approved before the year ends. If it does pass, U.S. investors could get DOGE exposure without actually buying it from an exchange. According to analyst Crypto Beast , rumors are going around that Dogecoin ETF could be approved next week. Despite this potential boost, the data shows a different story. CoinGlass figures reveal that short liquidations beat long liquidations almost 2-to-1 in DOGE futures trades. Around 43 million DOGE were liquidated in just 24 hours. Although this momentarily bumped the price up, it casts doubt on the coin’s ability to hold steady. With major holders trimming their DOGE positions, more investors are eyeing alternatives like Remittix. Why DOGE Holders Are Moving to Remittix (RTX) While Dogecoin gets most of its energy from memes and social media, Remittix (RTX) stands out by focusing on real-world financial uses. According to crypto analyst Ali , DOGE’s big transaction volumes are shrinking and it doesn’t offer clear benefits beyond internet hype. In contrast, Remittix offers quick crypto-to-fiat swaps, cross-border payments and easy setups for merchants, all features that appeal to more serious investors. One sign of Remittix’s growing success is its presale, which has already brought in more than $12.3 million. It’s not just retail buyers who are interested; bigger investors are also taking notice. With Dogecoin stuck at certain resistance levels, people looking for bigger returns see RTX as a better bet, since its main goal is to compete with old-school financial systems. How Remittix Beats Dogecoin in Real-World Use Unlike DOGE , which mostly depends on hype, Remittix is built to solve actual problems, like high transaction fees and slow payments. It connects easily with everyday businesses, allowing fast conversions between crypto and cash. This practical approach gives RTX an edge over DOGE , which doesn’t have a solid financial plan behind it. Remittix is also running a giveaway , pulling in large numbers of new users before its full release. This kind of early community growth is a big plus when compared to Dogecoin , which lacks a similar roadmap. By lining up real-world adoption and keeping transaction costs low, Remittix shows it’s here to stay, not just ride a wave of online buzz. Regulatory Focus and Multi-Chain Design Another reason Remittix is winning over DOGE holders is how it puts compliance first and can work with different blockchains. Dogecoin remains at the mercy of market hype and doesn’t focus as much on bridging with multiple networks. As more companies look for practical blockchain solutions, RTX stands out for its flexibility and ability to meet regulatory requirements. Should You Move On From Dogecoin? Dogecoin still has dedicated fans, but its recent whale sell-offs and uncertain growth are concerning. An ETF could give it a short-term pop, but there’s no guarantee it’ll stay strong over time. Many traders are hunting for safer yet high-potential coins that offer real usefulness. That’s why Remittix is catching on as a top contender. Unlike Dogecoin , which struggles with stability and relies on internet popularity, Remittix is built for everyday finance needs. With crypto whales snapping up RTX and its strong potential to become a leading payment-focused token, Remittix appears to be the most promising successor to both meme coins and older financial models in 2025 and beyond.

Here’s Current Price,https://timestabloid.com/pi-network-trading-goes-live-on-these-top-exchanges-heres-current-price/,"Pi Network has officially transitioned from its Enclosed Mainnet phase to an Open Mainnet, enabling external connectivity and trading its native cryptocurrency, Pi Coin (PI). According to Crypto Aman, this significant milestone has led to PI’s listing on several major cryptocurrency exchanges, including OKX, Bitget, and BitMart. The current trading price of PI is approximately $1.85. Exchange Listings and Market Reception The Open Mainnet launch has facilitated PI’s integration into prominent exchanges: OKX: Initiated PI/USDT spot trading, providing a platform for users to trade PI seamlessly. Bitget: Not only listed PI but also introduced a $60,000 Pi airdrop pool for eligible users, aiming to incentivize trading and increase liquidity. BitMart: Launched PI trading pairs, offering a $3,000 USDT giveaway to 300 selected users, enhancing user engagement and market activity. $PI has been listed on #Bitget and many other exchanges. Now it's currently trading at $1.85 #PiNetwork #Picoin #Pi #PiNetwork2025 pic.twitter.com/BZ05DOOW03 — Crypto Aman (@cryptoamanclub) February 20, 2025 These listings have generated substantial interest within the cryptocurrency community, as evidenced by the surge in trading volumes and active participation in promotional events. Price Dynamics and Market Speculation Following its debut, the price has since stabilized to the current level of $1.85. Analysts suggest that this reflects the market’s process of finding a sustainable valuation for PI amidst speculative interest and actual utility. Community Engagement and Future Prospects The Pi Network community has been instrumental in driving the project’s momentum. The network boasts over 100 million registered users, with a sizable portion actively engaged, generating a tangible buzz of excitement within the community. This robust user base has been pivotal in promoting exchange listings and fostering ecosystem development. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The future success of Pi Network hinges on its ability to provide practical uses for PI tokens. To achieve this, the network must focus on two key areas: developing decentralized applications (dApps) and establishing partnerships with merchants to accept PI as a payment method. Additionally, the network’s commitment to regulatory compliance and security is important in building trust and ensuring long-term viability. The transition to an Open Mainnet and subsequent exchange listings mark a pivotal chapter in Pi Network’s evolution. While the initial trading phase has been characterized by volatility, the true measure of PI’s success will be its adoption and utility within the broader economy. As the network improves and integrates with various platforms, stakeholders will keenly observe how PI positions itself within the competitive cryptocurrency landscape.

Pi Network, the closely followed tap-to-earn cryptocurrency network, launched its open mainnet today , Feb. 20, at 8 am UTC. The launch was a significant milestone for the project, which has been in development for over six years and has operated in an enclosed mainnet since 2021. With the mainnet launch, Pi community members, referred to as pioneers, can trade their Pi coins while developers on the network are able to showcase their work to a global user base. Developers have already built over 100 applications catering to various sectors, including decentralized finance and gaming. Unlike traditional proof-of-work networks, Pi enables users to mine PI via a mobile application, making participation accessible to a global audience. This accessibility has driven massive adoption, with millions of users engaging with the network even before its official launch. Pi Network currently has over 3.8 million followers on X, more than the Ethereum Foundation, Solana, and other major networks. At its peak, the project boasted over 50 million users. The Pi Network mainnet launch was highly anticipated due to its scale. As soon as the Pi mainnet went live, several centralized crypto exchanges, including OKX, HTX, Bybit, MEXC, Gate.io, BitMart, and Bitget, listed Pi coin (PI). Meanwhile, Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, has taken a different approach by conducting a poll on whether it should list PI. The poll will run until Feb. 27, and the result is unlikely to change. Other prominent exchanges, such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Upbit, have not confirmed whether they will list Pi Network’s coin. You might also like: Pi Coin close to securing potential Binance listing ahead of mainnet launch Pi Coin sees major volatility following listing Pi Coin’s price saw significant volatility following its listing on crypto exchanges. Per data from CoinGecko, PI is up 36.8% within the first hour after securing multiple listings, hitting a high of $1.97. At press time, Pi Coin was trading at $1.8 on OKX and $1.78 on Bitget, marking a steep drop from the speculative IOU prices of $61 to $70 seen just a day before the mainnet launch. Shortly after listing, the altcoin briefly surged to $3.4 on Bitget before quickly retracing to its current levels. Meanwhile, on Bybit, PI’s price fell below the $1 mark shortly after trading commenced. Nevertheless, Pi Coin could see further gains as its large community base and newcomers looking to cash in on the hype continue to accumulate the token. The hype surrounding potential listings on major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken could further drive buying pressure as investors position themselves in anticipation of a price rally. However, these gains could be short-lived if early miners, who have been accumulating Pi for years, start cashing out. Hype-driven rallies often face sharp pullbacks, and history shows that newly listed tokens tend to experience heavy sell-offs before finding a stable price range. Further, since these tier-1 listings could come days or even weeks later, the current hype might be cooled by then, reducing the impact on price action.

Early-stage crypto investments are particularly fascinating because they offer the chance to fund worthy initiatives before they become valuable. Four cryptos to invest in now valued under $0.30 have the potential to soar by 7,000%, transforming an $800 investment into $56,800.

Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): The Meme Coin with Utility and Long-Term Potential Officially the token of Pudgy Penguins, PENGU, has emerged as one of popular Solana meme coins with a strong community support. The token has become a cultural phenomenon, showing up in corporate branding, ETF ads, and viral social media content unlike other meme coins without utility. With millions of followers and over 50 billion social media impressions, PENGU gains from the constantly-expanding Pudgy Penguins ecosystem.

At about $0.008, Penguin provides a modest starting point for investors trying to profit from the buzz around community-driven meme coins.

Lutnick also added that Trump wanted to create an External Revenue Service to oversee tariffs and other potential foreign revenue. Lutnick’s remarks on Jesse Watters Primetime on Fox News came as the IRS was reportedly set to lay off 6,000 workers starting today. The reductions are expected to affect enforcement workers, who represent a large share of those recently hired. Trump’s administration wants to shrink the overall federal workforce by shedding new hires across agencies through layoffs. Trump seeks to abolish the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 🚨 COMMERCE SEC. LUTNICK: ""President Trump's goal is to ELIMINATE the Internal Revenue Service and let outsiders pay."" LFG! ABOLISH IRS! 🔥 ""Imagine a Democrat Senator going against that? What planet are they on?"" pic.twitter.com/iLWzPuh0hH — Nick Sortor (@nicksortor) February 20, 2025 The Commerce Secretary also acknowledged that Elon Musk’s capacity as a senior White House adviser leading DOGE was going to cut $1 trillion in wasteful tax. He also added that Trump’s administration will get rid of all the tax scams that had been hammering against America. The CEO of BGC Group believes that Trump is focused on America and wants to drive down the country’s foreign waste abuse. Lutnick said that getting rid of tax scams will help them raise a trillion dollars in revenue. Watters asked Lutnick if he was going to give the savings from DOGE cuts back to the American people. Lutnick replied that Trump’s goal was to abolish the IRS and let all the outsiders pay. “Well, think about it. Donald Trump announced the External Revenue Service and his goal is very simple. To abolish the Internal Revenue Service and let all outsiders pay.” – Howard Lutnick , U.S. Secretary of Commerce. The Washington Post first confirmed on Sunday an IRS employee tied to Elon Musk’s DOGE team was seeking access to an IRS system that had sensitive taxpayer data. Trump signed an executive order that allowed Musk’s DOGE team to oversee government agencies and the federal workforce with the goal of mitigating bloat. DOGE’s team initiative has drawn several lawsuits accusing it of violating privacy laws regarding access to sensitive data. Three federal employees’ unions have retaliated by suing the Trump administration in an attempt to stop the Treasury from sharing confidential data with DOGE. Senate confirms Lutnick to lead Trump’s Commerce Department The Senate announced on Tuesday that Howard Lutnick will lead the Commerce Department after voting 51-45. Lultnick will oversee the agency and other subagencies, including the Census Bureau, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The billionaire’s new role positioned him to also lead Trump’s sweeping trade and tariff agenda. Lutnick also revealed he would bolster American innovation in artificial intelligence and help the U.S. compete with China in technological innovations. Republicans have welcomed Trump’s tariff strategy to boost the American industry despite some reservations over potential cost increase for consumers. Democrats bashed Trump’s administration and Lutnick during the confirmation process for heavily relying on tariffs. The Democrats argued that Trump’s tariff strategy will raise prices. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri highlighted on Tuesday night that DOGE employees were required to adhere to all federal laws related to privacy. The White House claimed that the department was simply trying to mitigate fraud in government databases. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed in an interview that Musk’s team was working within guardrails. Bessent also argued that DOGE wanted to modernize an outdated IT system and Americans “don’t have to be concerned about any of this.” Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky also maintained that anybody who looks at government data is bound by rules on privacy. Paul believes that the department has to look at the data to find the problems and that if anyone breaks the rules, they’ll get in trouble. Senate Majority Leader John Thune also conceded that there were concerns regarding the privacy of personal information.

Arctic Pablo Coin (APC): Token Burns Fueling Value Growth Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC ) is setting itself apart from other meme coins through its innovative token burn mechanism. Each week during the presale, unsold tokens are permanently burned, reducing the overall supply and helping to create scarcity.

The burn transactions are tracked on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring transparency and security for investors. In addition, the mechanism aims to stabilize the value of the token over the long term, benefiting holders as the project continues to grow. With each burn, Arctic Pablo Coin becomes more scarce, and its value rises accordingly. This deflationary feature is a key element of its success and sets it apart from many other meme coins.

""Is There a Memecoin Investment?""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/coinbase-ceo-brain-armstrong-talks-about-bitcoin-and-memecoins-is-there-a-memecoin-investment/,"Recently, memecoins that have been released one after another and have created a pump dump effect have been on the agenda. The most talked about among these were the memecoins named Libra (LIBRA), TST and BROCCOLI. While experts warn investors that memecoins are risky, another warning came from Coinbase CEO Brain Armstrong. Coinbase CEO warned memecoin investors while also supporting memecoins, saying market participants should keep an open mind about the future of memecoins. Armstrong said that he was not actively investing in memecoins, but that memecoins were culturally and technologically very important. Claiming that even Bitcoin (BTC) is a kind of memecoin, the famous CEO stated that Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to be the biggest example for memecoins. Armstrong warned investors to be wary of new projects, noting that there has been recent insider trading in memecoins. The Coinbase CEO recently called on the crypto community to focus on more permanent and guaranteed gains rather than chasing quick profits, arguing that memecoins will evolve to serve more meaningful purposes over time. “About Memecoins… Memecoins have gotten a lot of attention lately and I've received some questions about what I think about them. I am not personally a memecoin trader (aside from a few test trades), but they have become very popular. They have been with us since the beginning, without a doubt – Dogecoin is still one of the most popular coins. Even Bitcoin is a memecoin (you could argue that the US dollar is too, once it is decoupled from gold). ….” On memecoins… Memecoins have generated a lot of buzz recently, and I’ve gotten some questions on how I think about them.

I maintain a hold rating on the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF due to mixed valuation and technical trends, despite its substantial growth. DAPP's portfolio has diversified with increased large-cap exposure and a high long-term EPS growth rate, but its elevated P/E ratio poses risks. Technical analysis shows DAPP in a long-term uptrend with key support at $14, but RSI momentum remains weak, warranting caution. Bitcoin has been quiet since late November. The world’s biggest cryptocurrency soared after President Trump’s election win, but despite much de-regulatory optimism, the digital currency has been stuck in a range between about $90,000-$109,000. Not surprisingly, shares of companies that are adjacent to bitcoin and involved in crypto mining have sagged in the last few months. Of course, AI chatter is higher than ever. Today, I’m revisiting the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF ( DAPP ). I was neutral on the fund back in the second quarter of last year, and it went on to trade sideways before catapulting in advance of and through the November 5 elections. I reiterate a hold rating today given the valuation and technical trends. With a host of important earnings dates on tap, I will note key levels on the chart, all while bitcoin continues to meander under the $100,000 mark. Bitcoin has been a snoozer for 3 months now. It has been all about gold. TradingView Gold Beating Bitcoin YTD stockcharts.com According to the issuer , DAPP seeks to track as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the MVIS Global Digital Assets Equity Index, which tracks the performance of companies that are participating in digital-asset economies. The ETF aims to invest in companies at the forefront of the digital assets transformation while offering investors diversification through exposure to exchanges, miners, and infrastructure firms. The issuer states that DAPP offers access to companies that have the potential of getting 50% of revenue from digital assets. DAPP has grown substantially since my June 2024 analysis; total assets under management has swelled from near $100 million to more than $230 million. The ETF’s annual expense ratio is moderate at 0.51% while the trailing 12-month dividend yield is surprisingly high at 3.81% care of a large year-end distribution two months ago. Share-price momentum remains strong, according to Seeking Alpha’s quantitative scoring system, but I’ll highlight a broad sideway technical price action pattern later in the article. DAPP is also a risky ETF given its exclusive exposure to the digital transformation space and a concentrated portfolio. Finally, liquidity metrics are mixed due to moderate average daily volume of less than 400,000 shares and a median 30-day bid/ask spread of 29 basis points, per VanEck. So, I would encourage prospective investors to use limit orders, particularly around the market open. Looking closer at the portfolio, there have been key changes since my previous analysis. There’s now 18% large-cap access compared with 0% last spring. Moreover, there’s a bit less mid-cap exposure and a higher weight to small-cap growth. Overall, the style box is more diversified. Unfortunately, the price-to-earnings ratio has increased given the ETF’s 47% rally since June 1 of last year. The good news is that DAPP’s long-term EPS growth rate is high, above 30%, so the PEG ratio is somewhat attractive in the face of high volatility. DAPP: Geographic Breakdown, Portfolio Details Morningstar DAPP holds a focused mix of fintech stocks. More than half of the portfolio is considered in the Financials sector while 45% is invested in shares from the Information Technology sector. In all, the top 10 stocks account for 62% of the allocation. I would also call out that there’s a notable 30% ex-US chunk, so currency swings will play a role in how the fund performs. Finally, there is a slew of earnings reports on tap that may impact DAPP’s largest holdings. DAPP: Holdings & Dividend Information Seeking Alpha Crypto, AI, and Digital Tech Earnings On Tap Wall Street Horizon Seasonally, there isn’t a lot of performance data to go off of, but DAPP has historically performed well in February and March before experiencing volatility in April. DAPP: Bullish Near-Term Seasonality, But Limited Data Seeking Alpha The Technical Take With an elevated P/E and rangebound crypto prices, DAPP’s technical situation is mixed but broadly bullish. Notice in the chart below that shares have retreated sharply from their December 2024 peak above $20. The ETF’s rally paused near the low from several years ago, so we have a key line in the sand to monitor going forward. Also take a look at the long-term 200-day moving average—its slope is positive, asserting that the bulls control the primary trend. What I don’t like, however, is the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the graph. It has been ranging in a somewhat weak area between 30 and 50; I’d like to see it climb to new YTD highs to confirm a new price uptrend. But with a high amount of volume by price now below where DAPP trades, there should be solid support on a pullback. In the short term, $14 has been defended by the bulls while a long-term uptrend support line is seen near $11. DAPP: Long-Term Uptrend, Resistance Near $20, $14 Support stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a hold rating on DAPP. The ETF fell by about 30% from its late-2024 peak to the February low as bitcoin wobbled below $100,000. I see mixed risks both on valuation and with the technicals as key earnings reports roll in.",BTC-USD|DAPP,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-02-20 09:48:44

The crypto market is in a bear trap. Bear traps are integral to crypto market bull runs. A famous crypto analyst has spotted four utility altcoins—SUI, XRP, ADA, and ONDO—as the leaders for the current bull cycle’s last phase. In his latest podcast , he named these coins as the ones likely to surge in the final three months of the bull run. Altcoin Picks & Market Timing In the meantime, the analyst explained that the crypto market is in a bear trap, reflecting a typical situation for a cryptocurrency bull cycle. Using historical data, he showed how these pauses allow cryptocurrencies to retrace and later recover to set new price levels in the cycle’s final months. For the four altcoins he spotted, the analyst cited ongoing developments within the cryptocurrency’s ecosystem that he expects will boost its value. He mentioned the upcoming Walrus token launch and gaming innovations that should boost SUI’s adoption, making its current price a good entry point ahead of the bull run.

Many altcoins have produced even more impressive gains over the past 24 hours, with XRP surging to $2.7 and SUI going to $3.3. BTC Taps $97K After the massive volatility experienced at the start of the previous business week, the primary cryptocurrency calmed in the following days and stood mostly in a range between $95,000 and $97,000. Each breakout attempt, such as the surge to $99,000 on Friday, was met with an immediate rejection, and the asset spent the weekend around the upper boundary of the range. Monday began with a price dip that drove it south to the lower boundary, but the bulls managed to defend that level. After another 24 hours of trading there, the bears took control on Tuesday evening and pushed BTC to a two-week low of under $93,500. However, the bulls stepped up at this point and didn’t allow a further breakdown. Just the opposite, bitcoin started to regain traction and jumped past $96,000 yesterday and up to $97,000 earlier today. This means that its market cap has neared $1.930 trillion on CG. Its dominance over the alts has also climbed to 58%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView XRP Goes Up Most altcoins endured similar pressure on Tuesday but managed to recover most losses in the following 36 hours. Ripple’s cross-border token is among the top performers on a daily scale, having surged by nearly 5% to a multi-day peak at $2.7. SUI has added a similar percentage and is up to $3.3, while XLM has gained 3.5% and trades close to $0.35. ADA, AVAX, SOL, and HBAR are also slightly in the green, while HYPE and TAO have soared by 8% and 15%, respectively. In contrast, the recent high-flyer LTC has retraced by 6% and is below $130 now.

In a Feb. 19 post on X, Carter didn’t mince words, arguing that the LIBRA debacle, involving Argentine President Javier Milei, has exposed just how corrupt the memecoin space has become. He suggested that while memecoins initially appeared to offer retail investors a fair shot at profits, recent projects have been anything but transparent. “The casino didn’t take a slight edge—it was more like 90/10 in favor of the house,” Carter wrote, referencing the rampant bot-driven launches and insider cash-outs that have characterized many recent memecoin projects. He pointed to celebrity-backed tokens, including those linked to Donald Trump and viral influencer Hailey Welch, as further proof that the memecoin market is no longer a playground for fair speculation but rather a breeding ground for pump-and-dump schemes. However, not everyone agrees that memecoins are doomed. Memecoins as a “Stress Test” for Blockchain Adoption Armani Ferrante, the founder of Backpack, believes memecoins still serve a purpose—one that goes beyond gambling and speculation. In a recent interview, Ferrante said memecoins act as a “stress test” for future financial systems, demonstrating how on-chain assets and transactions can scale globally. “That’s really what memecoins are. They’re an enormous proof-of-concept for real-world finance coming on-chain,” Ferrante explained. He compared memecoins to the early days of emerging technologies, where innovations often start out looking like “toys” before evolving into something transformative. “Sooner rather than later, we’ll find ourselves with what we are all hoping and dreaming about—which is all the world’s value moving onchain.” Even Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong seems to agree, urging the crypto community to remain “open-minded” about memecoins. “New technologies often look like a toy but evolve into something much more powerful over time,” Armstrong said, comparing memecoins to the early days of the internet and animated GIFs. Trading Activity is Already Declining Despite the debate over their long-term viability, early signs suggest investor enthusiasm for memecoins is cooling. Data from Dune Analytics shows that new token launches on Solana’s memecoin deployer, Pump.fun, have plummeted 59% in just one month. On Jan. 23, a record 71,735 tokens were launched on the platform. But by Feb. 19, that number had dropped to just 28,898.

Right now, three crypto coins are making the most noise: DTX Exchange (DTX) , Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA). While XRP and ADA are some of the best cryptos, DTX is a presale star in the bonus stage. Since it has already given early buyers an 800% return, many experts think it could see another 1,800% jump before the year ends. Meanwhile, the price of Ripple has seen a slight jump on the weekly chart. On the other hand, the ADA price is on a downtrend. Nevertheless, market experts like Dark Defender and Sjuul have made bullish price predictions for these tokens. DTX Exchange (DTX) Gains Media Attention Amid an 800% Price Increase While Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) are among the top crypto coins, DTX Exchange (DTX) is also making a name for itself. This is because of its great crypto ICO performance, which has provided early buyers with an 800% return while raising over $14M so far. Given that a Tier-1 CEX is expected to list this crypto coin soon, these numbers will continue rising. The hype was high for DTX Exchange as it recently launched a hybrid trading platform that offers over 120K asset classes to trade. These include stocks, CFDs and crypto coins. With leverage of up to 1000x, users may also gain access to $100K in liquidity with a simple $100 investment. Not only that, copy trading is also available, which means even novice traders can make profits by copying trades from veterans. Thus, over 600K users have already registered. Recently, CoinMarketCap listed the platform’s native token, DTX, which is now in the bonus stage of its presale. This may increase demand as millions of new eyes could gravitate to it. Currently, DTX costs just $0.18, but this altcoin price will rise to $0.20 soon after a Tier-1 CEX lists it. Those who want to get governance voting rights, discounts on trading fees and capitalize on this 11% growth are now rushing to buy this crypto coin before its value skyrockets. Dark Defender: The Price of Ripple (XRP) May Skyrocket Soon Ripple (XRP) is one of the top 10 altcoins at the moment. CoinMarketCap shows that the price of Ripple increased over 5% on the weekly chart. During that time, its value grew from around $2.40 to nearly $2.60. Market expert Dark Defender also excited traders with his Ripple price prediction. According to his X post, this altcoin may see a price surge soon. He foresees the price of Ripple (XRP) soaring to $8. Nevertheless, many traders are still skeptical about the Ripple coin as its market cap now sits at around $150B. In other words, a lot of new money will need to flood in for the price of Ripple to skyrocket. Because of this, investors are looking at crypto coins like DTX instead. The Cardano (ADA) Price Could See a Pump, Expert Claims Unlike the price of Ripple, Cardano (ADA) is showing some bearish signs. On the one-month chart, its value has fallen from around $1 to nearly $0.70. In other words, nearly a 30% drop for the ADA price in just a few short days. But, the community is still watching Cardano (ADA) thanks to some bullish statements from analysts like Sjuul. In a recent X post, he said there is still hope for a Power of 3 pattern for this crypto coin. Sjuul mentioned that the ADA price may surge to $1.65 soon. This Cardano price prediction has turned some heads. However, many investors are gravitating towards DTX instead. This is because the ADA price has already increased 20% on the YTD chart, meaning its highest upswings may have passed. DTX Exchange (DTX) vs. Ripple (XRP) vs. Cardano (ADA) – Which Crypto Coin May See Fast Price Gains First? DTX Exchange (DTX), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA) are all altcoins to watch this March as they could see big price gains. However, one stands out—DTX Exchange. This project is very innovative as it closes the divide between CEX and DEX. With this groundbreaking technology, it could dominate the online trading space, which Statista predicts could be worth $13B by 2026, giving it better long-term growth potential and stability. Furthermore, the DTX token will have a smaller market cap than its peers, which means faster price growth. Meanwhile, the XRP or ADA price will see slower gains. As a result, market experts foresee DTX potentially experiencing a 1,800% price pump before the year ends.

On X (formerly Twitter), he presents himself as President Donald Trump’s personal war machine, the man in charge of tearing down Washington’s bureaucratic mess through the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E). He claims he’s axing federal jobs, shutting down agencies, and cutting billions in wasteful spending. But inside the White House, the story is not quite the same. The Trump administration now swears in court that Musk is just an adviser, not a decision-maker. In a legal filing on Tuesday, the White House testified that Musk has no control over D.O.G.E and no real power in government. Trump needs Musk, but he also needs to distance himself. A new poll released Wednesday shows 55% of Americans believe Musk has too much influence. If the White House admits Musk is running D.O.G.E, it could fuel constitutional challenges and weaken Trump’s populist image. So they’re playing both sides—letting Musk take credit while legally denying his authority. pic.twitter.com/gA9MwklW7H — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 20, 2025 White House scrambles to rewrite Musk’s role The White House can’t keep its story straight. On Tuesday, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that D.O.G.E is nothing more than an advisory board that delivers recommendations to Trump and his cabinet. “A president wins an election, and he appoints staff, including myself … including Elon Musk,” said Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff. “And those staff report to him.” Yet just hours later, Musk sat beside Trump for a pre-recorded Fox News interview, talking about how he’s dismantling the federal government. He described his “special relationship” with Trump, his mission to enforce executive orders, and how he’s leading the charge against bureaucracy. So, which version is true? A growing number of lawsuits demand answers. Federal courts are struggling to define Musk’s role in government. More than a dozen lawsuits have been filed against Trump’s D.O.G.E, accusing it of operating outside legal boundaries. At a hearing on Monday, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan challenged Trump’s lawyers on Musk’s unchecked power. “What appears to be the unchecked authority of an unelected individual and an entity that was not created by Congress and over which it has no oversight” raises serious constitutional concerns, Chutkan said. Many Democratic attorneys general want Musk and D.O.G.E blocked from interfering with federal agencies. But courts are hesitating. The problem is nobody can define what D.O.G.E actually does. Chutkan refused to grant an emergency order stopping Musk. She ruled that D.O.G.E’s exact role is still unclear, making a legal intervention premature. The same lack of clarity is hurting other lawsuits. Since D.O.G.E operates in the shadows, plaintiffs can’t prove how or where it will strike next, making it difficult for courts to act preemptively. D.O.G.E operates in secrecy while Musk adds to the chaos A month into Trump’s second term, D.O.G.E remains a mystery. The office has no known administrator, no published list of employees, and no public records of its decisions. The only thing that’s clear? Musk is calling the shots—at least on X . Since Trump’s inauguration, Musk has flooded his X platform with announcements about government programs being cut, employees being removed, and agencies being shut down. At times, it’s impossible to tell whether he’s speaking for himself or for the government. Earlier this month, a Wired investigation identified many D.O.G.E staffers. Musk responded immediately, posting on X that revealing their identities “should be considered a criminal act.” The White House, meanwhile, claims D.O.G.E is operating under “total transparency.” “All of our actions are fully public,” Musk told reporters at the White House this week. While lawsuits pile up, Trump is turning D.O.G.E into a political selling point. At the FII Priority Summit in Miami Beach, Florida, Trump announced that he’s considering sending 20% of D.O.G.E savings directly to Americans. “There’s even under consideration a new concept where we give 20% of the D.O.G.E savings to American citizens and 20% goes to paying down debt,” Trump said. Musk has promised that D.O.G.E will cut $2 trillion in federal spending from the $6.75 trillion annual budget. If that happens, that means $400 billion could be redistributed to taxpayers—roughly $5,000 per household. Some Republicans are already trying to pitch the plan as a “D.O.G.E dividend.” Others warn that without proof of real savings, it’s nothing more than an election gimmick.",OP-ED|D.O.G.E,EN,0,0,DOGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-20 10:02:01

As that case is coming to a conclusion soon, analysts predict bullish technical forecasts for the coin. Meanwhile, one more token that has gained attention is Yeti Ouro (YETIO) , a rising meme coin that is showing bullish signs in presale. While analysts debate XRP’s potential to surge 1,000% in 2025, YETIO’s unique blend of gaming utility and deflationary tokenomics captures interest as a coin that offers something different. Here’s why investors are balancing bets between these two contrasting opportunities. XRP Price Prediction: XRP’s 1000% Potential XRP is only behind Bitcoin and Ethereum when it comes to market cap. With a massive amount of $153.3 billion, a 1000% gain seems like a far-fetched claim. XRP price is current at $2.61 . But if XRP is to manage this magical feat, regulatory developments will be key. The SEC’s acknowledgment of Grayscale’s XRP ETF application hints at growing institutional acceptance, mirroring Bitcoin’s 2024 trajectory. However, there are challenges for XRP too. It requires massive inflows to sustain continued growth, and its legal battle with the SEC remains unresolved. Recent price volatility – a 17.8% drop in the past month despite bullish fundamentals highlights the risks of relying solely on regulatory catalysts. However, that being said, XRP’s impact on the DEX industry cannot be denied and it remains a stable investment option. YETIO’s Presale Gives A Strategic Edge Amid XRP’s uncertainty, YETIO is attracting retail investors with its Stage 3 presale, offering a 10% bonus to early buyers. Unlike most meme-based tokens, YETIO uses tangible utility to differentiate itself in the market. It does this through Yeti Go, its Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game where players earn tokens via competitive races, staking rewards, and in-game purchases. To achieve AAA-level quality, Yeti Ouro has partnered with a top-tier game asset studio with a portfolio that includes Call of Duty, Dead Space, The Witcher, and Spider-Man. The game’s audio design is being crafted by Grammy-nominated professionals who have collaborated with Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid, ensuring Yeti Go delivers an immersive and high-quality experience. Moreover, the project’s deflationary model is also an added advantage. YETIO’s capped supply at 1 billion tokens with 5% burned permanently creates scarcity, which in turn grows price in the long run. XRP’s 100 Billion supply lacks this factor. Moreover, YETIO is safe and ensures full transparency. The project is audited by SOLIDProof and mitigates smart contract risks, which gives it a critical edge in the market. With over 197 million tokens sold already, analysts suggest YETIO could outperform legacy assets like XRP in the short and the long term. YETIO in its third presale stage is $0.024 which means early bird investors are seeing a 100% ROI already. Why You Must Add YETIO To Your Portfolio? It has been seen historically that while stable assets like Bitcoin and XRP provide security in the long run, young projects like YETIO are the ones that give exponential returns. Moreover, XRP’s 1,000% potential depends on macro trends and other external factors, but its size limits rapid growth. YETIO on the other hand, is focusing on launching a game that could shake the industry and create long-term demand for its tokens. Conclusion XRP remains a major player in crypto’s institutional future, and YETIO leads the new era of utility-driven projects. With its 10% presale bonus, audited security, and immersive gaming experience, YETIO is much more than just a meme. It’s a strategic bet in a volatile market. Smart investors are eyeing both XRP and YETIO to have a more balanced portfolio that caters to their risk appetite and growth expectations.

Interestingly, the Palantir stock price opened at $123.86 but declined to a low of $108.56 before recovering significantly to $112.06. However, this drop was not unexpected; a series of events brought this outcome. Let’s discuss. Reasons Behind the Palantir Stock Price Crash Today A Washington post is one of the most significant reasons behind the Palantir stock price drop. The report mentioned Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s new guidelines for an 8% annual reduction in the Pentagon’s budget over the next five years. This reduction will significantly affect military contractors like Palantir, which generates significant revenue from U.S. government contracts. Interestingly, Palantir’s 2024 annual report discloses that its top three government clients account for 17% of its total revenue. More importantly, these clients are under the Department of Defense, so this budget cut would significantly impact their revenue. As a result, investors feared the cut, inducing selling pressure on the PLTR stock, which caused a 13% price drop. However, that is not all. Palantir Technologies CEO Alex Karp also had news that affected the stock price. Karp recently adopted a new stock trading plan, which allows him to sell 10 million shares in the next eight months, disturbing investors’ confidence. Although the previous plan had even bigger sales, the revelation of this new plan around the budget cut exaggerated the market’s reaction. Is Palantir Stock Valuation Headed Towards Doom? The PLTR exponential price rally in 2024 brought everyone’s attention to this stock. Over the past year, the Palantir stock price has surged nearly 380%, but concerns about its sky-high valuation have increased. The Company’s P/E (price-to-earnings) ratio is 594.20, which shows investors’ aggressive growth expectations. However, a few stock analysts anticipate a slow to 22% year-over-year growth over the next two years, much less than the holders’ expectations. At the same time, some analysts claim that the PLTR stock is overvalued and the Pentagon’s budget cut brings its actual worth out. Despite these claims, Palantir stock is among the top-performing stocks in the AI sector. Although Jefferies’ Brent Thill maintains its underperforming rating, some believe it could benefit from government AI investments and cost-cutting initiatives. What’s Next: Is This a Buying Opportunity? Financial market experts have often regarded the downtrend as a buying opportunity. However, this is not always true. The Palantir’s historical price performance and demand make it a considerable opportunity for investors. Analysts’ opinions are the same after considering its growth in the commercial AI business. However, investors should still monitor the stock price performance regarding government spending and changes, as PLTR stock price show signs of volatility.

Eleanor Terrett shared that the SEC, now led by Mark Uyeda, has decided to drop its appeal in a lawsuit over its dealer rule expansion. This rule would have classified high-frequency trading firms and some crypto hedge funds as dealers, which many in the crypto space saw as a way to regulate trading firms without direct rules. SEC’s U-turn seems to be a fresh start for crypto users. A Controversial Rule That Sparked Industry Backlash The SEC had planned to change the definition of a broker-dealer, which would have required crypto liquidity providers and automated market makers (AMMs) with over $50 million in capital to register with the agency. This move angered many in the community, especially from DeFi supporters, who argued that such a rule was unrealistic for platforms without a central authority. Since DeFi operates in a decentralized manner, enforcing compliance would have been nearly impossible, putting its future in the U.S. at risk. Court Ruling Blocks the SEC’s Plan Crypto trade groups, including the Blockchain Association and the Crypto Freedom Alliance of Texas, took the SEC to court, arguing that the agency had gone beyond its legal limits. In November, a Texas federal judge agreed, ruling that the SEC had overstepped its authority. This blocked the proposed rule, dealing a major setback to the agency’s regulatory efforts. Though the SEC initially pushed back, it unexpectedly dropped its appeal on Feb. 19, officially ending the case. Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith called it a “complete and total victory,” saying the crypto industry could now move forward without fear of excessive regulations. https://twitter.com/KMSmithDC/status/1892305333533524264 According to a crypto user, the SEC’s decision to drop its appeal is a clear rejection of regulatory overreach. The analyst highlighted how unelected officials attempted to expand their authority to suppress crypto innovation but were ultimately blocked by the courts and new leadership. DOGEai cheered this major victory for the industry, proving that pro-growth policies are on the way. Trump’s Crypto-Friendly Approach The SEC’s retreat comes at a time of major leadership changes. Following former Chair Gary Gensler’s exit, Trump has reshaped the agency, appointing Mark Uyeda as acting chair while his nominee, Paul Atkins, awaits congressional approval. Under Uyeda, the SEC has already shown signs of easing its aggressive stance on crypto. One of the agency’s biggest moves under new leadership is the formation of a dedicated Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Hester Peirce. Known for her support of fair and clear regulations, Peirce’s task force is expected to reassess many of the enforcement actions taken against crypto firms under Gensler’s tenure. With the SEC now stepping back from legal battles and reconsidering its approach, the crypto industry is hopeful that this marks the beginning of a more balanced regulatory framework.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-20 10:10:48

The question has sparked debate within the crypto community, especially concerning the types of decentralized applications (dApps) that the platform seems to embrace or reject. Recently, Ethereum’s co-founder, the influential Vitalik Buterin, stepped into the fray to address these very claims head-on. His remarks have resonated deeply, stirring conversations about the moral direction of blockchain technology and the values that should guide its development. Let’s delve into Vitalik’s powerful statement and explore what it means for the future of Ethereum and the broader crypto landscape. Vitalik Buterin’s Unwavering Crypto Ethics In a candid Ask Me Anything (AMA) session hosted on the Web3 social protocol Tako, Vitalik Buterin didn’t mince words. He expressed his profound disappointment with the notion that Ethereum should be more accepting of gambling-related applications simply because other blockchains are. This wasn’t just a casual dismissal; it was a clear articulation of his ethical stance and vision for the Ethereum ecosystem. He emphasized that if the blockchain community veers towards embracing what he perceives as ‘distorted morals,’ his enthusiasm for active participation diminishes significantly. This statement is a powerful reminder that for Vitalik, and likely many others, the ethos behind cryptocurrency extends far beyond mere technological innovation; it’s deeply intertwined with moral and societal values. But what exactly did Vitalik mean by ‘distorted morals’? And why is this stance so crucial for understanding the future trajectory of Ethereum? Let’s break down the key elements: Ethical Foundation: Vitalik’s comments underscore the importance of ethical considerations in the blockchain space. He’s not just concerned with technological advancement but also with the societal impact of these technologies. Community Values: His statement reflects a desire to cultivate a blockchain community that is guided by strong moral principles, rather than simply chasing trends or popular applications, especially if those applications are perceived as morally questionable. Vision for Ethereum: This clarifies Vitalik’s vision for Ethereum. He sees it as more than just a platform for any and all applications; he envisions it as a platform that fosters innovation aligned with positive societal values. The Gambling Application Debate in the Blockchain Community The rise of blockchain technology has opened doors for a myriad of applications, including gambling platforms. While some see decentralized gambling as a natural evolution of the technology – offering transparency and fairness – others view it with skepticism, citing concerns about addiction, social impact, and regulatory challenges. Several blockchains have indeed become havens for gambling dApps, attracting users and developers keen on this sector. This has led to a perception, particularly from some quarters, that Ethereum’s relative reluctance to wholeheartedly embrace gambling applications equates to ‘intolerance’. However, is ‘intolerance’ the right word to describe a considered ethical stance? Vitalik’s response suggests a firm ‘no’. He isn’t necessarily against all forms of gaming or entertainment on Ethereum. Instead, his concern seems to stem from a broader question: What kind of ecosystem do we want to build? Why Does Vitalik’s Stance on Crypto Ethics Matter? Vitalik Buterin is not just a co-founder of Ethereum; he is a thought leader in the entire cryptocurrency space. His opinions carry significant weight and often shape the direction of discussions and developments within the industry. His recent comments on crypto ethics and the gambling application debate are particularly important for several reasons: Aspect Significance of Vitalik’s Stance Setting a Precedent Vitalik’s public stance can set a precedent for other blockchain platforms and projects. It encourages developers and communities to think critically about the ethical implications of their work. Influencing Community Values His words can influence the values and priorities of the Ethereum community and potentially the wider crypto community. It prompts reflection on what kind of applications and behaviors should be encouraged and celebrated. Guiding Development By clearly articulating his ethical boundaries, Vitalik provides guidance for developers and project builders within the Ethereum ecosystem. It signals the types of projects that are more likely to align with the platform’s long-term vision and values. Attracting Like-Minded Individuals A strong ethical stance can attract individuals and projects that share similar values, fostering a community that is not only technologically advanced but also morally conscious. Decentralized Applications and the Future of Ethereum The conversation around gambling dApps is just one facet of a larger discussion about the types of decentralized applications that will define the future of Ethereum. As the platform continues to evolve, particularly with advancements like the Merge and ongoing scalability solutions, it’s crucial to consider the ethical compass guiding its growth. Vitalik’s comments serve as a timely reminder that technology, even decentralized technology, is not value-neutral. The choices made by developers, communities, and leaders will ultimately shape the kind of world that blockchain technology helps to create. What are the implications for developers building on Ethereum? Ethical Considerations in Development: Developers should proactively consider the ethical implications of their dApps, beyond just technical feasibility and market demand. Community Alignment: Understanding the values and priorities of the Ethereum community, as articulated by leaders like Vitalik, can help developers create projects that are more likely to be welcomed and supported. Long-Term Vision: Focusing on building applications that contribute positively to society, rather than just chasing short-term gains or trends, can lead to more sustainable and impactful projects on Ethereum. Blockchain Community and the Moral Compass Vitalik’s statement is not just about Ethereum; it’s a call to the entire blockchain community to reflect on its moral compass. As this technology matures and becomes increasingly integrated into various aspects of life, the ethical considerations become even more critical. The choices made today will define the character of the decentralized web of tomorrow. Key Questions for the Blockchain Community: What values should guide the development and adoption of blockchain technology? How can the community foster a culture of ethical innovation? What role should leaders play in shaping the moral direction of the space? How can we ensure that decentralized technologies are used for good and contribute to a more just and equitable world? These are not easy questions, but they are essential for the long-term health and positive impact of the blockchain industry. Vitalik Buterin’s bold stance is a vital contribution to this ongoing conversation, urging us to consider not just what we *can* build with blockchain, but what we *should* build. A Powerful Vision for a Responsible Crypto Future Vitalik Buterin’s recent remarks serve as a powerful wake-up call. They highlight the crucial need for ethical considerations to be at the forefront of blockchain development. His unwavering commitment to a morally grounded Ethereum ecosystem sends a clear message: the future of decentralized technology should be built on a foundation of sound values and responsible innovation. This vision, while challenging, is ultimately essential for ensuring that blockchain technology fulfills its potential to create a better, more equitable, and truly decentralized world.

Speaking at the FII Priority Summit in Miami on Wednesday, Trump linked the performance of the cryptocurrency market and traditional financial indices to his leadership. “ In just a few months, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 2,200 points, and Bitcoin has set multiple all-time record highs because everyone knows that I’m committed to making America the crypto capital,” Trump stated . “We want to stay at the forefront of everything, and one of them is crypto.” Notably, since Trump secured the Republican nomination on July 15, 2024, when Bitcoin was priced around $61,000, its value has surged to an all-time high of $109,114 on January 20, marking a gain of approximately 78.88%. Analysts attribute part of the rally to increased optimism among crypto investors, fueled by Trump’s public endorsements and promises to end regulatory hostility towards the crypto sector. The president also took aim at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Chairman Gary Gensler, criticizing its past approach to cryptocurrency regulation. Trump claimed that the agency had maintained an adversarial stance toward Bitcoin and other digital assets but was forced to soften its position in the face of growing public support for crypto. “ I have signed executive orders to keep the United States at the forefront of artificial intelligence and to end Joe’s war on Bitcoin and crypto ,” Trump added. “ We ended that war totally, that war is over. They were very hostile toward them until the very end, just because there are so many people on Bitcoin and crypto. Just before the end, the SEC came out and they were being very nice. I was so nice to people because so many people were being indicted for no reason whatsoever, very political group of people. But they pulled those indictments because they realized there were 100 million, 125 million people using crypto.” Since returning to office, Trump has taken steps to solidify his support among crypto enthusiasts. Notably, he nominated Paul Atkins, a well-known crypto-friendly figure, to chair the SEC while Brian Quintenz was nominated for the CFTC. He also issued an executive order titled “Strengthening U.S. Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” which explicitly bans the development and promotion of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), a move widely applauded by crypto advocates. That said, Trump’s pro-crypto stance has earned him praise from major figures in the industry, with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson suggesting that his policies could elevate the U.S. as a global crypto hub.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Donald Trump|USA,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|ADA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-20 11:52:51
40583830,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131264,1740052421,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,MicroStrategy Layoffs: Crypto Firm Slashes Workforce by 20% in Bold Restructuring Move,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/strategy-microstrategy-workforce-reduction/,"In a dramatic turn of events for the cryptocurrency world, Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has revealed a significant reduction in its workforce. According to a recent MarketWatch report, the company slashed its employee count by a staggering 20.7% in 2024. This move brings their total headcount down to 1,534 as of December 31st, signalling a major shift in the company’s operational strategy. For those closely watching the volatile crypto markets, especially Bitcoin and companies intertwined with it, this news raises crucial questions about the future direction of firms like Strategy and the broader implications for the digital asset landscape. What exactly led to these drastic cuts, and what does it mean for the future of Bitcoin strategy and the crypto industry as a whole? Why the Sudden Crypto Workforce Reduction at Strategy? The numbers paint a clear picture: Strategy underwent a substantial crypto workforce reduction in 2024. Let’s break down where these cuts were most prominent: Research & Development (R&D): Bearing the brunt of the reductions, R&D saw a loss of 144 positions. This is a significant figure, especially for a company often perceived as being at the forefront of technological innovation. Could this indicate a shift in their technological focus, or perhaps a belt-tightening measure in response to market conditions? Consulting: The consulting department experienced the second-largest cut, with 124 jobs eliminated. Consulting services are often a revenue generator for tech firms, so a reduction here might suggest a recalibration of their service offerings or a response to decreased client demand. Sales & Marketing: With 95 positions cut, the sales and marketing teams were also significantly impacted. This could point towards a change in their market approach, potentially focusing on more streamlined or digital-first strategies, or again, it could be a cost-saving initiative. To visualize the impact, here’s a simple table: Department Job Cuts Research & Development 144 Consulting 124 Sales & Marketing 95 Total Reduction ~363 (across reported departments) MicroStrategy Restructuring : More Than Just Layoffs? While the headlines focus on layoffs, it’s crucial to consider if this is part of a larger MicroStrategy restructuring effort. Companies don’t typically make such deep cuts without a strategic rationale. Several factors could be at play: Economic Downturn & Market Volatility: The past year has seen significant volatility in the cryptocurrency market. Economic uncertainties often lead companies to reassess their operational costs and streamline their workforce to weather potential storms. Shift in Business Focus: Perhaps Strategy is pivoting its business model. A reduction in R&D, for instance, might seem counterintuitive, but could indicate a shift from heavy in-house development to leveraging existing technologies or focusing on different areas within the crypto space. Increased Automation & Efficiency: Technology advancements, especially in AI and automation, are changing workforce needs across industries. It’s possible Strategy is adopting more automated systems, requiring a leaner workforce to operate effectively. Cost Optimization: Ultimately, businesses are driven by profitability. Layoffs are often a direct, albeit painful, way to reduce operational expenses and improve financial performance, especially in a publicly traded Bitcoin company like Strategy. Impact on Bitcoin and the Crypto Market Strategy, under its former name MicroStrategy, is famously known for its massive Bitcoin holdings. Any significant operational change within such a prominent Bitcoin company can send ripples through the crypto market. Here’s how these layoffs could potentially impact the broader ecosystem: Market Sentiment: Layoff announcements can sometimes create negative market sentiment. Investors might interpret this as a sign of internal struggles or a pessimistic outlook on the future, potentially leading to market dips. Innovation Slowdown?: Cuts in R&D, in particular, could raise concerns about a potential slowdown in innovation from Strategy. However, it’s also possible they are becoming more focused and efficient in their innovation efforts. Broader Industry Trend?: Are these MicroStrategy layoffs an isolated incident, or are they indicative of a broader trend within the crypto industry? Other crypto firms have also faced challenges in recent times. This could be a sign of industry-wide adjustments in response to market maturity and evolving regulations. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? For investors, employees in the crypto space, and industry observers, these developments offer several key takeaways: Due Diligence is Crucial: Company restructurings, like these Bitcoin company layoffs , highlight the importance of thorough due diligence. Understand the financial health and strategic direction of companies you invest in or work for. Adaptability in the Crypto Job Market: The crypto job market, while dynamic, is also subject to fluctuations. Professionals in this space need to be adaptable, continuously upskilling, and prepared for potential shifts in workforce demands. Market Vigilance: Pay close attention to company announcements and market trends. Events like these layoffs can offer valuable insights into the health and direction of the crypto industry. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Crypto Landscape Strategy’s workforce reduction is a stark reminder of the ever-evolving nature of the cryptocurrency industry. While the news of layoffs is undoubtedly concerning for those affected, it also presents an opportunity to understand the strategic shifts happening within major crypto players. Whether this MicroStrategy restructuring is a necessary step towards long-term sustainability or a sign of deeper challenges remains to be seen. However, it underscores the critical need for agility, strategic foresight, and resilience in navigating the exciting yet unpredictable world of crypto assets.

However, analysts believe this is just a brief cool-off before the next meme coin supercycle begins. A meme coin supercycle is a market phenomenon in which several meme coins see exponential growth in a short period of time. This growth results from bullish market sentiment, social media trends, hype, and cultural relevance. Instead of relying on strong technical and fundamental metrics, meme coins derive their value from community perception. Their ethos is, ‘It doesn’t have to make sense to make you money.’ Previous meme coin supercycles made hundreds of millionaires overnight. In 2021, for instance, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) surged 1,000,000%. That’s a $1M return for every $100. During the same time, Dogecoin ($DOGE) exploded to $0.70 from just a fraction of a cent, largely due to Elon Musk’s endorsement. A coin that started out as a joke is now the biggest meme coin, with a mind-boggling market cap of $37.73B. What Are the Indicators of the Upcoming Meme Coin Supercycle? The market looks perfectly positioned for the next meme coin bull run, as evident from three factors. Increased engagement on platforms like TikTok, Twitter, and Reddit. The famous Roaring Kitty-GameStop saga , by the way, was a Reddit baby. Celebrities and influencers have begun creating and promoting meme coins. A surge in trading volumes and demand for ERC-20 meme coins , which caused an increase in Ethereum gas fees. What’s more, after falling from $0.40 to $0.25, $DOGE has been holding its support quite well. The token appears to be in the accumulation phase, ready for the next upward move. Something similar is happening in $SHIB, too. After a sharp correction of around 50% in the last two months, the token has protected its lows of $0.00001500. Both these giant meme coins now look ripe for the next leg up higher, which could potentially drive the next meme supercycle. Looking for the best meme coins to benefit from the upcoming madness? Here are three early-stage tokens you can invest in right now. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Meme Coin to Invest in Right Now forFree $BTC Airdrops Built to rally behind Bitcoin’s historical growth to $1M, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is a meme coin at heart. That means it’ll not only benefit from increasing crypto adoption (and so rising Bitcoin prices) but also the meme coin supercycle. $BTCBULL holders will receive free $BTC rewards when Bitcoin breaks out from its current range and reaches new milestones. The first $BTC airdrop event will take place at $150K, and the second at $200K. When $BTC reaches $250K, the project plans a massive $BTCBULL token airdrop. There will also be regular token burn events. Every time $BTC’s price increases by $50K, BTC Bull Token will remove part of the total token supply from circulation to beef up demand and maintain an upward price trajectory. Because it’s the only meme coin that offers $BTC airdrops, BTC Bull Token’s presale was destined for greatness. And it didn’t disappoint! Within just 24 hours of its launch in early February, it raised a whopping $500K. The presale kitty currently sits at $2.4M, and interested investors can join now for just $0.00237 per token. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana Meme Coin with Real Utility Solana is an ideal blockchain network for meme coins, as it’s both fast and cheap. But can it maintain its current performance throughout this meme coin supercycle? Doubtful. The network is rife with issues, namely, congestion and limited scalability. As a result, investors can no longer be confident that their transaction will go through successfully in the first attempt. Improvement is Solana’s need of the hour. Enter Solaxy ($SOLX) . By combining Ethereum’s rollup architecture and Solana’s efficiency, Solaxy’s off-chain transaction processing system will significantly reduce the burden on Solana’s main network. Solaxy won’t just ride the meme coin supercycle but seeing as it offers real utility, too, it can easily become the next crypto to explode . With over $22.5M raised, the $SOLX presale is currently offering each token for just $0.00164. For more guidance, check out our guide on how to buy $SOLX . 3. Broccoli ($BROCCOLI) – CZ’s Pet Dog-Inspired Explosive Meme Coin Broccoli has been all the rage (only fitting because it’s inspired by a Belgian Malinois) in the memecoin market since last week. The dog in question is the pet of Binance’s ex-CEO, CZ, who revealed his fascination with meme coins and then his dog’s name and picture last week on X. As expected, CZ’s followers flooded the market with newly minted $BROCCOLI tokens. CZ was absolutely spot on when he said, ‘There is never a dull day in crypto.’ After catapulting to new all-time highs almost every single hour for the first four days, the token has finally gone sideways. It’s currently trading at $0.038 . Even though $BROCCOLI grew 947% in the last seven days, there’s always room for more growth for a hype-backed meme coin. Its consolidation phase might present a great entry point for new investors who can benefit from $BROCCOLI’s next surge. Verdict These top trending cryptos are the most likely to skyrocket in the upcoming $DOGE and $SHIB-led meme coin supercycle. However, the harsh reality is that meme coins can get buried into the ground just as quickly. Such is their volatility! That’s why you should only invest an amount you’re comfortable to potentially lose.

Notably, since experiencing a sharp drop on February 3 and subsequently recovering, the second-largest cryptocurrency has been confined within a tight channel, with price oscillating between the $2,800 resistance level and the $2,500 support zone. However, despite this weakness , something is brewing under the hood, an underlying shift that could trigger a major breakout for ETH. One of the most notable developments in the Ethereum market is the sharp decline in the amount of ETH held on exchanges. According to crypto analytics firm Santiment, currently, only 6.38% of the total ETH supply remains on centralized trading platforms, marking the lowest level since the cryptocurrency’s inception. “From a long-term perspective, ETH continues to move off of exchanges and into cold wallets at a shocking pace…Meanwhile, the community has been showing some renewed interest in crypto’s 2 market cap asset here in February.” The firm tweeted Tuesday. Notably, approximately 4.36 million ETH has been withdrawn since early 2024, reducing selling pressure and setting the stage for a potential rally if demand increases. Another bullish factor is the decline in Ethereum transaction fees. On Wednesday, Santiment highlighted that the average ETH transaction fee now sits at $0.41, significantly lower than the $15.21 high seen in the past two years. Lower fees indicate reduced network congestion, making Ethereum more accessible to new investors and developers and, in turn, strengthening ETH’s value. Beyond exchange balances and fees, optimism surrounding Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra hard fork on April 8 is also surging. On Tuesday, analysts at QCP Capital noted that Ethereum upgrades often follow a “buy the rumor, sell the news” pattern. They highlighted how ETH’s price doubled before the 2022 Merger and surged 30% after Shanghai in 2023, suggesting that if history repeats, a similar upswing could unfold post-Pectra. Some analysts argue that Solana (SOL), once a top Ethereum competitor, is losing credibility due to a series of meme coin scandals, including LIBRA, which could drive capital back to ETH. “ Solana’s narrative as the best chain for retail adoption has shifted to one of fraud and insider trading, The hate on Ethereum for UX, lack of interop, and social layer dichotomies has been progressing steadily in a stronger way than ever. Tides are shifting. Watch SOLETH as a barometer.” Rollup Ventures co-founder Andy said on Tuesday.

Despite the recent drawdown, bulls don’t need to panic just yet as the bull run is expected to continue unless ETF outflows take full control. The leading crypto is now down by 5% over the past 30 days. The twist in the current market scenario is that while Bitcoin ETFs are struggling to keep up, Ethereum ETFs are quietly stacking inflows. The nine spot Ether ETFs recorded $19 million in net inflows, which has now tripled against the previous day’s gains. Fidelity’s FETH led the charge with $24.47 million, though Grayscale’s ETHE lost $5.45 million. Bitcoin ETF outflows hit $71M As per the data shared by SoSoValue, February 19 saw Bitcoin ETFs record another round of outflows as over $71 million exited the market. This marked the second consecutive day of printing red indexes for the BTC ETFs. The biggest hit came from Fidelity’s FBTC which bled $48.39 million, while Valkyrie’s BRRR and ARK 21Shares’ ARKB posted $9.27 million and $8.65 million of outflows simultaneously. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s IBIT didn’t see a single-dollar move. On February 18, ETFs linked to the biggest crypto registered a net outflow of more than $60 million. This took the weekly outflow toll to breach $131 million. The prior week, which ended on February 14, turned out to be the biggest flop in recent times as it knocked $585 million in outflows. Bitcoin price has failed to regain the $100K mark after Donald Trump- led bullish rally lost its steam. BTC is printing red indexes on the longer time frame. However, it has gained marginally in the last 24 hours, trading at an average price of $97,000 as of press time. Ethereum has recorded even worse numbers than Bitcoin over similar time frames. Ether price has dropped by 16% in the last 30 days and 19% over the past 60 days. However, it has gained 2% in the last 7 days and is trading at an average price of $2,700 as of press time. ETF flows cool post-election pump It appears Bitcoin is losing momentum while Ethereum is gaining steam. However, it could also be a shakeout before BTC finds new highs. Either way, demand and supply are all that matter—everything else is just noise, says Ki Young Ju, CEO of Cryptoquant. Ju, in an X post, mentioned that the BTC ETF demand has slowed by staying net positive. He added that this bull cycle would last until high ETF outflows emerge, meanwhile, prolonged net negative demand would signal the start of a bear cycle. #Bitcoin ETF demand has slowed but stays net positive.

Despite this rebound, ADA price has struggled to maintain consistent momentum eyeing more gains ahead. Meanwhile, Grok 3, an advanced AI model, predicts that Cardano’s price could reach $5 to $6 in this cycle. The model also highlights ADA’s decentralization, positioning it as a strong contender in the blockchain space. AI Grok 3 Predicts Cardano Price to Hit $5 This Cycle Grok3 has ranked Cardano as the most decentralized blockchain globally, according to consensus layer metrics. Cardano’s Nakamoto Coefficient stands at 58, meaning it would take 58 stake pools to control 51% of the network. The Gini Coefficient sits at -0.45, reflecting an even stake distribution, while Shannon Entropy measures at 6.5 bits, indicating high diversity. With nearly 3,000 stake pools managed by independent operators and 70% of ADA staked across 1.3 million wallets, participation is widespread. The network also features Voltaire on-chain governance, allowing ADA holders to vote on a $1.5 billion treasury, excluding exchanges and project founders.

Recently, PEPE has seen a significant price drop as it hit its weekly low. At the same time, PEPETO , the latest memecoin sensation, keeps gaining momentum. As PEPE keeps struggling with market volatility, #PEPETO keeps securing its position in the market and the hearts of investors with its strong presale numbers and unique ecosystem. PEPETO’s Rise: A Threat to PEPE? #PEPETO isn’t just a memecoin; it is a project designed to redefine the crypto space by offering tangible utility and unifying all memecoins into a single exchange. And unlike its predecessor, #PEPE, which struggles with declining momentum and investor sell-offs, keeps capturing the attention of both retail and institutional investors.

Every milestone has been achieved, and the… pic.twitter.com/zCmy1bTRQY — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) January 1, 2025 However, rather than being a direct threat to PEPE, PEPETO stands as the evolution for memecoins as it blends meme culture with real utility. In PEPETO’s roadmap, staking rewards, a decentralised exchange, and NFT utilities are some of the benefits users will receive when launched. Broadly, this changes a lot of things in the crypto space, as new meme projects must offer more than just a viral moment to keep their long-term growth going. Therefore, instead of viewing PEPETO as a threat to PEPE, have you viewed it as a natural progression to the memecoin sector? A progression that could redefine what it means to be a meme-based digital asset in 2025 and beyond. PEPE’s Decline: What’s Causing the Price Drop? In the memecoin market, PEPE is one of the most recognised. However, its recent dip in value to $0.59648 over the past week has brought about concerns in the crypto market. Analysts observe PEPE forming a double bottom, which indicates a potential reversal pattern on charts. However, the market sentiment remains cautious. This dip in value occurred as a reason for crypto whales selling off their PEPE holdings. By virtue of large sell-offs, the market experiences an increased panic selling as other retail investors will also want to sell off their #PEPE. And since there’s no significant pressure to buy, there’s an increased market volatility which has caused a price drop. On the bright side, some traders see this dip as an opportunity. They suggest accumulating PEPE at these low prices to gain massive profits if a reversal occurs. Will PEPE Recover, or Will PEPETO Take Over? #PEPE’s history in the financial market has shown how it has recovered from dips in the past, and it could happen again. But without new developments or utility, there’s a high risk of it being overshadowed by newer and more innovative meme tokens like #PEPETO. Meanwhile, as PEPETO continues to approach the $5 million mark in presale, investors are prepared and optimistic about its potential for explosive growth. About PEPETO PEPETO is a next-generation meme coin that blends humour, tangible value, and community-driven growth. It aims to do better than the #PEPE coin by introducing innovative features that give it value and make investors feel included.

40583951,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131429,1740052671,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Kyrgyzstan’s Bold Move: Ditching CBDC for Innovative Gold-Backed Stablecoin,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/kyrgyzstan-gold-backed-stablecoin/,"In a surprising turn of events in the digital finance landscape, Kyrgyzstan has announced a significant shift in its approach to digital currencies. Instead of joining the global trend of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), this Central Asian nation is charting a different course. Let’s dive into why Kyrgyzstan is rejecting the CBDC path and enthusiastically embracing a gold-backed stablecoin. Why is Kyrgyzstan Saying ‘No’ to CBDC? The global conversation around digital currencies has been heavily focused on CBDCs, with many countries exploring their potential benefits. However, Kyrgyzstan has decided to buck this trend. While the exact reasons haven’t been explicitly stated, we can infer some potential factors behind this decision: Concerns about Centralized Control: CBDCs, by their very nature, are centrally controlled by the central bank. Kyrgyzstan might be wary of granting excessive control over the financial system to a single entity. This could stem from concerns about data privacy, potential for censorship, or a preference for decentralized financial models. Existing Financial Infrastructure: Kyrgyzstan’s current financial infrastructure and the needs of its population might not align perfectly with the solutions CBDCs offer. Perhaps the perceived benefits of a CBDC didn’t outweigh the costs and complexities of implementation in their specific context. Focus on Alternative Solutions: By choosing a gold-backed stablecoin, Kyrgyzstan signals a preference for alternative digital currency models that might better suit its economic priorities and values. This move suggests a proactive approach to digital finance, just not through the CBDC route. The Allure of Gold-Backed Stablecoins: A Shining Alternative [img]gold_stablecoin.jpg[/img] Gold bars, representing the backing of the stablecoin. So, if not CBDC, then what? Kyrgyzstan’s answer is a gold-backed stablecoin . This is a fascinating pivot and here’s why gold-backed stablecoins are gaining traction and might be appealing to Kyrgyzstan: Stability and Trust: Gold has historically been considered a safe haven asset, a store of value that withstands economic turbulence. Backing a stablecoin with gold can instill greater trust and stability compared to fiat-backed or algorithmic stablecoins, especially in economies seeking to hedge against inflation or currency devaluation. Tangible Asset Backing: Unlike many digital assets that are purely digital, a gold-backed stablecoin has a tangible asset backing it – physical gold reserves. This tangible backing can provide a sense of security and intrinsic value, which can be particularly attractive in markets where trust in purely digital systems is still developing. Potential for International Trade: Gold is recognized and valued globally. A gold-backed stablecoin could facilitate international trade and remittances for Kyrgyzstan, potentially simplifying cross-border transactions and reducing reliance on traditional banking systems. Attracting Investment: The unique proposition of a gold-backed stablecoin could attract investors interested in both digital assets and the stability of gold. This could potentially bring capital into Kyrgyzstan and boost its financial sector. Digital Currency Evolution: Is Kyrgyzstan Ahead of the Curve? Kyrgyzstan’s decision prompts a crucial question: Is focusing on a gold-backed stablecoin a more pragmatic and innovative approach than pursuing a CBDC, at least for certain nations? While CBDCs are often touted as the future of money, they come with their own set of challenges, including implementation complexities, privacy concerns, and the risk of stifling innovation in the private crypto space. Let’s compare CBDCs and gold-backed stablecoins in a table: Feature CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) Gold-Backed Stablecoin Issuer Central Bank Potentially private entities or government-backed initiatives Backing Fiat currency, government trust Physical gold reserves Control Highly centralized Potentially more decentralized depending on implementation Volatility Aimed to be stable against fiat currency Potentially linked to gold price fluctuations but generally stable relative to other cryptocurrencies Privacy Potential privacy concerns due to centralized control Privacy aspects depend on the specific stablecoin design Innovation Potentially limited to central bank-driven innovation Opens doors for private sector innovation within a gold-backed framework Navigating the Challenges and Embracing the Gold Standard in the Digital Age Developing and implementing a successful gold-backed stablecoin is not without its hurdles. Kyrgyzstan will need to address several key challenges: Ensuring Transparency and Auditability: Robust mechanisms must be in place to guarantee that the stablecoin is truly backed by sufficient gold reserves. Regular audits and transparent reporting are crucial to maintain public trust. Regulatory Framework: A clear and supportive regulatory framework is needed to govern the issuance, circulation, and redemption of the gold-backed stablecoin. This framework should address anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) concerns while fostering innovation. Technological Infrastructure: A secure and efficient technological infrastructure is required to manage the digital currency, ensure smooth transactions, and protect against cyber threats. Choosing the right blockchain platform or technology will be vital. Public Adoption and Education: Widespread adoption will depend on public awareness and understanding of the gold-backed stablecoin. Education initiatives will be necessary to familiarize citizens with its benefits and usage. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn from Kyrgyzstan’s Strategic Choice? Kyrgyzstan’s decision offers valuable insights for other nations considering their digital currency strategies: One Size Doesn’t Fit All: The optimal digital currency solution is not universal. Countries should carefully assess their unique economic contexts, financial infrastructure, and societal needs before choosing between CBDCs, stablecoins, or other approaches. Embrace Innovation and Alternatives: Don’t solely focus on CBDCs. Explore alternative digital currency models like asset-backed stablecoins that might offer distinct advantages in specific situations. Prioritize Stability and Trust: In volatile economic climates, stability and trust are paramount. Gold-backed stablecoins can provide a compelling value proposition by combining the stability of gold with the efficiency of digital currencies. Foster Public-Private Collaboration: Successful implementation of digital currencies, whether CBDCs or stablecoins, often requires collaboration between government entities and the private sector to leverage expertise and drive innovation. Conclusion: A Powerful Statement in the Digital Currency Revolution Kyrgyzstan’s rejection of CBDC plans in favor of a gold-backed stablecoin is a powerful and noteworthy move in the evolving world of digital currencies. It signals a departure from the prevailing CBDC narrative and highlights the potential of alternative digital asset strategies. By focusing on a gold-backed stablecoin, Kyrgyzstan aims to leverage the enduring appeal of gold to create a stable, trustworthy, and potentially globally relevant digital currency. This strategic decision could position Kyrgyzstan as a pioneer in a new wave of digital finance, one that prioritizes asset-backed stability and offers a compelling alternative to the centralized control often associated with CBDCs. The world will be watching to see how this bold experiment unfolds and what lessons it holds for the future of money.

The SEC acknowledged another batch of XRP ETF filings, representing the agency’s formal review of the proposals. XRP is up 5.7% on the day, trading at $2.70 after climbing 11.2% in the last week, per CoinGecko data . SEC Acknowledges More XRP ETF Filings The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has acknowledged spot XRP ETF filings submitted by major asset managers Bitwise , WisdomTree , and Canary Capital , fueling optimism that XRP could soon be available to institutional investors through a regulated investment vehicle. In the filings acknowledging the proposals, the SEC asked for public comments to be sent 21 days after its filing was published in the Federal Register. The regulator then has up to 90 days to decide to approve, reject, or “institute proceedings”, with a final decision expected in up to 240 days. The timing of the SEC’s acknowledgment is noteworthy, as it coincides with growing speculation around the future of XRP amid the regulatory agency’s prolonged legal dispute with Ripple. The SEC is now seeking to reverse the SEC vs. Ripple court ruling, which determined that the blockchain firm’s programmatic sales of the XRP crypto were not securities transactions. Nonetheless, some pundits are optimistic that the SEC may soon pause its appeal in the Ripple case , which could provide a clearer path forward for the third largest crypto by market cap. While the SEC is still in its acknowledgment phase, Brazil has officially outpaced the United States to greenlight the first-ever spot XRP ETF , with Hashdex receiving approval from Brazil’s securities regulator to list the Nasdaq XRP Index Fund on the B3 exchange. Could XRP ETFs Hit The US Market In 2025? As you may recall, the SEC greenlighted the introduction of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January 2024 and spot Ether ETFs in July of the same year. Asset managers have since submitted a spate of crypto ETF filings over the past couple of months in light of the crypto-friendly Donald Trump administration assuming office. Last week, the SEC also acknowledged spot XRP ETF filings from Grayscale and 21Shares. This was interpreted as a powerful message given that the SEC has been locked in a multi-year-long legal battle with Ripple. Although these acknowledgments don’t necessarily guarantee an XRP ETF approval from the regulatory agency, they bode well for such an investment vehicle. Meanwhile, XRP is presently just 20.7% away from its lifetime high of $3.40 posted in January 2018. If the spot XRP ETFs successfully cross the regulatory finish line, they would likely attract considerable demand from institutional investors, subsequently putting the cross-border token on a path to new all-time highs. Alongside the spot ETF bullish catalyst, popular analyst DonAlt has observed that XRP’s chart is “excellent.” But as ZyCrypto recently covered, not everyone is pleased about the increasing prospects of a spot XRP ETF becoming a reality in the US. Well-known angel investor Jason Calacanis believes that the greenlighting of such a product would lead to “chaos,” contending that the token is a “centrally controlled security.”",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-20 11:59:19

Crypto Market Drops 15% The crypto market has dropped 15% from its peak of $3.72 trillion on December 17 to about $3.17 trillion, signaling a big correction. JPMorgan analysts note that this decline has brought CME bitcoin and ether futures close to “backwardation,” where future prices are lower than spot prices, similar to what happened last June and July. The analysts pointed out that this is a troubling sign, showing that institutional investors using regulated CME futures to invest in bitcoin and ether are showing weaker demand. This shift suggests less confidence from major players in the market. The analysts explained that when demand for bitcoin and ether futures is strong, they usually trade at a premium to spot prices, called “contango.” This premium, often over 10% a year, is driven by the high “risk-free” rate in crypto, where lending USD can earn 5%-10% annually. However, when demand drops and expectations for prices weaken, futures can fall below spot prices. The Lack of positive catalysts The analysts note that the drop in demand for CME bitcoin and ether futures is likely due to two main reasons. First, some institutional investors are cashing out because there aren’t any immediate positive triggers. They also noted that big crypto moves from the new U.S. administration probably won’t happen until later in the year, so investors are holding off for now. Secondly, funds that follow market trends, like commodity trading advisors, have been pulling back, which is also hurting demand. The analysts pointed out that both bitcoin and ethereum have been losing momentum, with ethereum’s momentum turning negative. Because of this, they warn that crypto markets could keep facing challenges in the near term. Bitcoin ETF Demand Slows Down In a recent X post, Cryptoquant CEO Kim Young Ju noted that while Bitcoin ETF demand has slowed, it remains net positive. He added that this bull cycle will continue until significant ETF outflows occur. Prolonged net negative demand would signal the start of a bear cycle. “Demand and supply are all that matter; everything else is just noise,” he said. #Bitcoin ETF demand has slowed but stays net positive.

However, traders should watch for signs of large ETF outflows, which might indicate a shift toward a bear market. Nevertheless, the Bitcoin proponents continue to advocate for Bitcoin. Recently, Kiyosaki has urged everyone to start saving Bitcoin, gold, and silver, calling them “real money.” He believes these assets can make people wealthier in the future as their prices rise. Last year, he tweeted that Bitcoin and these precious metals are key to financial success in the long run. Kiyosaki stresses that investing in Bitcoin, gold, and silver could be the answer to building future wealth. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

40584015,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131431,1740052794,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Unlocking Bitcoin’s Potential: Lightning Network Boosts Investment Value, Report Reveals",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/lightning-network-bitcoin-investment-value/,"Bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency, continues to evolve, seeking ways to enhance its utility and solidify its position as a leading digital asset. Recent research sheds light on a transformative development: the Lightning Network. A joint report by Fidelity Digital Assets and Lightning payments provider Voltage suggests that the Lightning Network is not just a technological upgrade, but a catalyst for increasing Bitcoin’s investment value . Let’s delve into the key findings and understand how this innovation could reshape the future of Bitcoin. Why is the Lightning Network Crucial for Bitcoin’s Investment Value? The core of the report emphasizes that the Lightning Network directly bolsters the investment value of Bitcoin by addressing some of its inherent limitations. Bitcoin, while revolutionary, has faced challenges in terms of transaction speed and cost-effectiveness, particularly for everyday transactions. The Lightning Network steps in as a layer-2 scaling solution designed to tackle these issues head-on. Here’s a breakdown of how the Lightning Network enhances Bitcoin’s appeal as an investment: Enhanced Usability: The Lightning Network makes Bitcoin transactions faster and cheaper, broadening its applicability for daily commerce and microtransactions. This increased usability makes Bitcoin more practical and attractive to a wider user base. Expanded Transaction Capacity: By processing transactions off-chain, the Lightning Network significantly increases the number of transactions Bitcoin can handle, overcoming scalability concerns that have been a point of contention. Accelerated Adoption: Improved usability and scalability pave the way for wider cryptocurrency adoption across various sectors, from retail to online services. As more businesses and individuals embrace Bitcoin through the Lightning Network, its network effect strengthens, driving demand and value. The report explicitly states that Lightning is an “innovative technology that supports the investment case for Bitcoin by increasing usability, expanding the use of network transactions and expanding adoption in various sectors.” This endorsement from established financial players like Fidelity Digital Assets lends significant credibility to the Lightning Network’s impact. 2024: A Pivotal Year for Lightning Network Adoption According to the research, 2024 has been a landmark year for the Lightning Network. The report highlights significant advancements in scalability, reliability, and cost reduction throughout the year. But perhaps the most compelling indicator of the Lightning Network’s growing influence is the adoption by major cryptocurrency exchanges. Consider these key developments in 2024: Major Exchange Integrations: Industry giants like Coinbase, Bitfinex, OKX, Kraken, and Binance have integrated the Lightning Network. This integration is a game-changer, providing millions of users with direct access to faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions within these platforms. Business Scalability: Businesses are increasingly leveraging the Lightning Network to scale their operations, especially those dealing with high volumes of small transactions. This practical application in real-world business scenarios further validates the network’s efficacy. Improved Payment Reliability: The report suggests marked improvements in payment reliability within the Lightning Network in 2024, addressing previous concerns about transaction success rates and stability. Decreased Transaction Costs: One of the most attractive features of the Lightning Network is its ability to drastically reduce transaction fees, making Bitcoin more competitive for everyday payments compared to traditional financial systems and even other cryptocurrencies on the main chain. The collective effect of these developments positions 2024 as a true turning point for the Lightning Network, signaling its transition from a promising technology to a vital component of the Bitcoin ecosystem. What are the Benefits of Investing in Bitcoin Enhanced by the Lightning Network? For investors, the rise of the Lightning Network presents a compelling narrative for Bitcoin. By addressing key limitations and expanding Bitcoin’s utility, the Lightning Network strengthens the fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin as an asset. Let’s explore the potential benefits for investors: Benefit Description Increased Utility Lightning Network expands Bitcoin’s use cases beyond just store of value, making it a more practical medium of exchange for everyday transactions. Enhanced Scalability By solving scalability issues, the Lightning Network reduces bottlenecks and allows Bitcoin to handle a larger volume of transactions, potentially supporting wider mainstream cryptocurrency adoption . Lower Transaction Fees Reduced fees make Bitcoin more attractive for smaller transactions, opening up new markets and use cases previously impractical due to high on-chain costs. Faster Transactions Near-instant transactions improve user experience and make Bitcoin more competitive with traditional payment systems in terms of speed. Positive Market Sentiment The integration of Lightning Network by major exchanges and positive reports from institutions like Fidelity can boost market confidence and attract further Bitcoin investment . These benefits collectively contribute to a stronger and more versatile Bitcoin, potentially driving long-term appreciation in its investment value . Are There Challenges to Consider? While the report paints a promising picture, it’s important to acknowledge that the Lightning Network, like any evolving technology, is not without its challenges. Understanding these challenges is crucial for a balanced perspective on its impact on Bitcoin investment . Some key challenges include: Complexity: Setting up and managing Lightning Network channels can be more complex than basic Bitcoin transactions, potentially creating a barrier to entry for less technically savvy users. Liquidity Management: Effective use of the Lightning Network requires users to manage channel liquidity, which can be a nuanced aspect requiring understanding and proactive management. Network Maturity: While 2024 is a pivotal year, the Lightning Network is still a relatively young technology. Continued development and refinement are necessary to address potential vulnerabilities and improve overall user experience. Adoption Hurdles: Despite increasing adoption, widespread mainstream adoption of the Lightning Network is not guaranteed. User education and seamless integration into wallets and services are crucial for overcoming adoption hurdles. However, the momentum behind the Lightning Network and the resources being invested in its development suggest that these challenges are being actively addressed by the community and developers. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? The Fidelity and Voltage report provides valuable insights for anyone interested in Bitcoin and the future of cryptocurrency. Here are some actionable takeaways: For Investors: Consider the Lightning Network as a significant positive catalyst for Bitcoin. Its advancements strengthen the long-term investment thesis for Bitcoin by enhancing its utility and scalability. For Businesses: Explore integrating the Lightning Network to facilitate faster and cheaper Bitcoin payments. This can be particularly beneficial for businesses dealing with frequent or microtransactions. For Bitcoin Users: Familiarize yourself with the Lightning Network and consider using Lightning-enabled wallets and services to experience faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions firsthand. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in the Lightning Network and the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. Continued innovation and adoption will shape the future trajectory of Bitcoin. Conclusion: A Brighter Future for Bitcoin Investment?

By tackling scalability and usability challenges, it unlocks new potential for Bitcoin as a practical, everyday currency and a robust investment value proposition. As cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow, and the Lightning Network matures, the future for Bitcoin appears brighter than ever. The integration by major exchanges and the positive assessment from financial institutions are strong indicators that the Lightning Network is not just a fleeting trend but a fundamental evolution that could redefine Bitcoin’s role in the global financial landscape. This is a powerful signal for the continued growth and relevance of Bitcoin in the years to come.

With the blockchain live, the project integrates Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) unspent transaction output (UTXO) security model with Ethereum ( ETH ) Virtual Machine (EVM) programmability, which helps create a more stable and intricate staking framework. AP3X will be listed on LBANK starting February 20, 2025, with initial yields estimated at around 10% per year. And we are live! AP3X is listed on @LBank_Exchange and @CoinstoreExc 🔥 pic.twitter.com/ftArYuuxXh — Apex Fusion (@ApexFusion) February 20, 2025 Apex Fusion’s PRIME Chain At the heart of the launch is PRIME, the network’s first operational chain, designed to establish a decentralized staking model. Over 130 stake pool operators (SPOs) have already been employed to secure the network, and AP3X token holders can participate in liquid native staking to earn annual rewards and promote network security . Looking ahead, Apex Fusion plans to expand its ecosystem with two additional layers: NEXUS, an EVM-compatible Layer-2 ( L2 ) chain for smart contracts, and VECTOR, a high-speed UTXO-based L2 for cost-efficient transactions. The upcoming Reactor Bridge will also further enhance interoperability and enable faster cross-chain transfers. Promoting transparency and regulatory compliance Governance and regulatory compliance are at the heart of Apex Fusion Foundation’s long-term strategy. The AP3X token has been classified as a utility token, which provides clear regulatory guidance for network participants, including PRIME Chain stakers. As Apex Fusion continues to improve its infrastructure, its multi-chain vision will come into focus more and more. In addition to Reactor Bridge, NEXUS, and VECTOR integration, an on-chain reputation tier system will also be introduced to reward verified contributions and foster trust among users.The launch of AP3X and PRIME is thus helping Apex Fusion take a major step forward in its plan to bridge blockchain ecosystems and promote Web3 adoption.

Still, the yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped and the dollar weakened. Cryptocurrencies are higher, with the CoinDesk 20 Index up 1.4% and bitcoin 1.2% over 24 hours. The gains follow remarks by Czech National Bank Governor Ales Michl, who reiterated the case for bitcoin as a reserve asset , and President Donald Trump saying he'd ended “Joe Biden’s war on Bitcoin and crypto.” Bitcoin traders are taking a wait-and-see approach as waning demand, a lack of blockchain activity and faltering liquidity inflows point to potential pullback to $86,000 . It's currently over $97,000. Their stance is visible not only in declining volatility, but also a significant drop in open interest. Open interest on bitcoin futures contracts has fallen below $60 billion from nearly $70 billion in late January, Coinglass data shows. The decline comes amid what appears to be an unraveling of the memecoin craze as recent struggles, such as Argentina's Libra debacle, dampened enthusiasm. “Right now, the market is in a bit of a cooldown phase,” David Gogel, VP of strategy and operations at the dYdX Foundation, told CoinDesk. “Bitcoin’s been holding up, but after failing to break past $105k in January, we’ve seen capital inflows slow down and speculative assets like Solana and memecoins take a hit.” That hit is visible in the aggregate open interest for futures contracts for SOL, the Solana blockchain's native token. OI dropped from around $6 billion late last month to around $4.3 billion now, according to data from TheTie. Solana is one of the leading networks for memecoins. “The market should stay attuned to broader macro-drivers and geopolitical developments that could trigger moves,” Wintermute OTC trader Jake O told CoinDesk. These geopolitical developments include rising tensions between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that led to a not-so-subtle public exchange. Declining leverage and a shift away from riskier plays suggest the market may be entering a new phase. What that actually entails remains to be seen. Stay alert!

The network claims to have 60 million users. There are fewer than 1 million active wallets. Based on a self-reported circulating supply figure of 6.3 billion, PI currently has a market cap of $7.8 billion. The premise behind Pi Network is a blockchain that allows users to mine tokens on their smartphones. It captured a considerable amount of attention from retail traders and has drawn comparison to viral tokens from previous cycles like SafeMoon. Token holders face the risk of a lack of liquidity. The token's most liquid exchange is OKX, but 2% market depth — the amount of capital required to move the price by 2% in either direction — is between $33K and $60K. This means an order of say $100K would shift the market considerably to present volatile trading conditions. Derivatives Positioning BTC volatility on derivatives has reached a monthly low, declining from an annualized 36.09% to 28.43%.

While this might be a false breakout, a new star has emerged in the DeFi space, attracting investors’ attention. The new project called DTX Exchange (DTX) has already gained 700,000 users due to its unique approach to trading. It combines centralized and decentralized models together to give users high liquidity, fast transactions, and low fees. Currently, in the crypto ICO phase, DTX holders have seen their portfolios grow by about 800%. Dogecoin (DOGE) Ready For Rebound As RSI Hits Oversold Region Dogecoin (DOGE), one of the top memecoins in the market, is showing upward movement in the weekly timeframe. The DOGE price has bounced off the $0.2425 support and is now targeting the $0.3 level. Reclaiming this level could spark a major surge in the DOGE price. Despite the little uptick, CoinMarketCap data reveals the DOGE price has plunged by 28.0% on the monthly chart. Nevertheless, the DOGE price could rise to new price targets soon. An analyst called Trader Tardigrade notes that Dogecoin crypto might experience another rally based on a historical pattern. The analyst said that the DOGE price might rise to $6 in the coming months. In another tweet, Trader Tardigrade notes the DOGE price is set for a rebound. The analyst argued that the cryptocurrency’s 4-hour RSI has reached the oversold zone. If a rebound occurs, the DOGE price could rise to $0.5 in the next few weeks. Ethereum (ETH) Predicted To Reach $3.1K The Ethereum price has been consolidating between $2,588.09 and $2,819.31 in the past seven days. The Ethereum crypto is among the top altcoins yet to set a new all-time high in the past year. Presently, CoinMarketCap data shows the Ethereum price has increased by 2.3% on the weekly timeframe. This Ethereum price surge shows that bulls might be finally gaining traction. Besides, Quinten Francois reveals that whales have been buying Ethereum (ETH) aggressively. Looking forward, Cas Abbe forecasts the Ethereum price might pump to $3.1k in the next few weeks. Another analyst called Trader Tardigrade posted a similar prediction. The analyst noted that the Ethereum price was trading in a symmetrical triangle. Tardigrade believes a breakout could occur anytime from now. If this happens, they expect the Ethereum price to skyrocket to $3,180 soon. Meanwhile, Ted, a crypto investor, says the Ethereum price might pump to $4k in a short time.

DOGE has long thrived on community enthusiasm, but its recent bearish trend has caused concerns among DOGE traders. Meanwhile, the DTX Exchange (DTX) is emerging as a standout performer, surging 44% even as the broader market struggles. This next-gen trading platform is revolutionizing finance by bridging centralized and decentralized markets, offering unmatched features. As the DTX presale enters a bonus round, could this be the next big thing in crypto? Continue reading this article to find out more about it. Dogecoin Price Drops: Can DOGE Survive the Bearish Trend? Dogecoin (DOGE) gained popularity in the cryptocurrency market for its enthusiastic community and meme-driven appeal. However, the landscape seems to be shifting. In today’s crypto world, investors are looking for ventures that provide genuine value rather than just hype. Given the Dogecoin price’s history of high fluctuation, investors’ enthusiasm for it is diminishing. As anticipated, declining interest in DOGE has had an impact on the Dogecoin price. Dogecoin price charts show that DOGE is on the cusp of producing a death cross, which occurs when the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) intersect. As shown on previous Dogecoin price charts, this is a typical bearish indicator indicating that sellers are gaining control. The Dogecoin price has plunged to $0.25, its lowest value since December 2024, raising fears among DOGE investors. This dip has established a break and retest pattern on the Dogecoin price charts, indicating that the bearish trend will continue. If the bears continue to be in control, DOGE might fall to $0.20. A drop below that level might push DOGE further down to $0.15, which corresponds to the 78.6% Fibonacci Retracement level. DTX Exchange Bridges Traditional and Crypto Finance – A Game Changer? DTX Exchange (DTX) is an upcoming exchange platform that is changing the traditional finance narrative by closing the gap between centralized and decentralized finance. This upcoming platform combines over 120,000 financial products like stocks, cryptos, ETFs, and forex assets under one roof. This means that users can manage all their assets on DTX without wasting their time circling between different platforms to manage different assets. This is made possible by their powerful layer-1 blockchain, VulcanX, which recently launched its testnet and gave an estimated TPS of over 200,000. This has got everyone anticipating DTX Exchange to be one of the fastest players in the industry. The platform’s innovative offerings are appealing to both experienced and novice traders and investors. DTX is offering up to 1000x leverage, massively enhancing liquidity, and giving users wide exposure to the market irrespective of the capital size. Additionally, it offers a distributed liquidity pool to ensure each trade is executed at the best pricing with minimum slippage. Another point that sets DTX apart is that it has made its presale available to all levels of investors instead of relying on venture capital companies. This democratized mode of presale launch allows retail investors to participate and enjoy all the advantages, such as profit shares, governance rights, and early access to features. DTX Tokens at $0.18: Could This Be a 100x Opportunity? The DTX Exchange is currently in its presale stage and has generated a lot of attention because of its excellent performance, raising over $14.8 million in funding. The presale just concluded its eighth presale round, which was supposed to be its final round. However, due to a massive surge in demand, they started a bonus presale round offering a last chance to investors to grab DTX tokens. Each DTX token is priced at $0.18, the lowest possible price. It is projected that this price will surge by 100x upon its tier-1 listing, which would provide all investors with a massive ROI.

This performance may soon change amid rumors that Cardano is collaborating with Binance to list its native assets. That would be a big deal as Binance has millions of customers globally. We explore some of the best Cardano coins that could explode higher. Best Cardano Coins That Could Surge Ahead of Binance Partnership Cardano, one of the biggest layer-1 blockchains , has a relatively weaker ecosystem than its top competitors like Ethereum and Solana. Some of the top Cardano coins that may explode higher ahead of the potential Binance partnership are Minswap (MIN), Indigo Protocol (INDY), and Snek (SNEK) Minswap (MIN) Minswap is one of the top Cardano coins that may bounce back and surge after the partnership. It is a notable player in the ecosystem since it is the biggest decentralized exchange (DEX). As such, it could achieve a similar growth like BSC’s PancakeSwap, Solana’s Raydium, and Ethereum’s Uniswap. Minswap has a total value locked (TVL) of $82.65 million and handled over $20.5 million in volume in the last 30 days. According to DeFi Llama , it has handled volume worth $3.37 billion since its inception. Therefore, a sudden boom of the Cardano ecosystem may push the MIN price much higher. Indigo Protocol (INDY) Indigo Protocol or INDY is another top Cardano coin to buy ahead of the Binance partnership. It is a blockchain project in one of the biggest subsectors in the crypto industry: Real World Asset tokenization. It has built a technology that lets developers to tokenize all assets. Assets created in its platform have accumulated a total value locked of over $60 million. Some of these assets include those that track cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Solana and currencies like the US dollar. INDY price may eventually surge like Mantra , another RWA asset that has soared since 2024. Snek (SNEK) Meme coins have been some of the best-performing assets in the crypto industry in the past few years. For example, Solana meme coins have helped to mint many millionaires. Snek, the biggest meme coin in the Cardano ecosystem, maybe a top beneficiary when the Binance partnership happens. The key catalyst for the Snek price is that it has formed a falling wedge and a bullish flag chart patterns. A wedge happens when there are two converging trendlines, while a flag has a vertical line and a rectangle-like formation. A strong rebound could push it to its all-time high of $0.0094, up by 105% from the current level. Snek Price The implication of Binance Deal With Cardano A partnership between Cardano and Binance would be a big deal, and would help to boost the value of ADA . It would add to other potential Cardano catalysts like a potential ADA ETF , Hoskinson VIP meeting , and BitcoinOS integration. Please note: Cardano tokens are fairly small and could experience substantial volatility. Trade with caution.

Clients of BitGo and Copper can now trade spot and derivatives on Deribit while assets are secured off-exchange in qualified custody with BitGo Trust, and automatically settled leveraging Copper ClearLoop and the Go Network, according to a press release. In a post-FTX world traders are looking to reduce the risks associated with leaving assets on exchanges where possible. BitGo and Copper announced a partnership two years ago to trade on exchanges while assets are held within a regulated custody ring-fenced environment. A simple function of the combined BitGo and Copper ClearLoop networks is delivery versus payment (DvP), so any BitGo client can instantaneously settle with any other BitGo client in an atomic swap of the assets without ever needing to bring those assets on chain, said Brett Reeves, head of BitGo’s Go Network. “We can do this DvP settlement from cold storage, and there's no fees for it,” Reeves said in an interview with CoinDesk. “So we're really looking at eliminating that settlement risk, or Herstatt risk , and moving it towards the traditional finance space.” Under the hood, assets are held with qualified or regulated custody at BitGo, and then at pre-defined intraday settlement periods, the assets that are owed to Deribit are removed from a BitGo account into the Copper ecosystem through to Deribit, Reeves explained. If these assets are owed to the client, it comes back the other way, he said. “The bulk of the client's assets remain within Bitgo custody, apart from a settlement time when they move to exchange,” Reeves said. “At settlement time, that's the P&L that they owe on the transactions, or the variation margin on their positions.” ""The synergies between our companies will unlock new opportunities for investors and will completely change the landscape of trading,"" said Luuk Strijers, CEO of Deribit in a statement.",Finance|Deribit|Copper|BitGo,EN,0,0,SPONSORED|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-20 12:00:19

An on-chain data by Nansen , a leading on-chain analytics platform, shows that a significant number of traders have suffered huge losses. Though Milei has deleted the post published in support of the meme coin, the opposition has demanded the initiation of the impeachment procedure against the president, terming the action of the leader of the country as an international embarrassment. LIBRA Meme coin’s Rapid Rise and Fall At one point, the market cap of LIBRA touched as high as $4.5 billion . Notably, it happened shortly after President Milei published an X post supporting the meme coin . Milei originally projected the project backing the meme coin as the one that would support the growth of the Argentinian economy and business landscape. It was the primary reason why the coin received unusual attention from the crypto community. Reports indicate as many as 40,000 crypto traders jumped into the market during this stage. However, the market cap of the token dropped sharply by over 90%, when insiders offloaded huge numbers of tokens, as per reports. By the time Milei realised his huge mistake and deleted his message from X, traders suffered huge losses. According to the Nansen data, at least 70% of wallets trading the LIBRA meme coin token from February 16 to 18 suffered huge losses. Reports show that on February 18 the number of token holders declined from 50,000 to 35,770. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Coin Launch Sparks Wild Price Swings – Sell or Hold? , Dark Reality of Political and Celebrity-Backed Meme Coins The LIBRA meme coin scandal serves as a cautionary tale about political and celebrity-backed meme coins.

Just last month, Metaplanet said it would accelerate its Bitcoin buys by issuing debt as part of its ambitious strategy to lead Japan’s Bitcoin renaissance. Metaplanet Now Holds 2,100 BTC Metaplanet, which trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, announced Thursday that it had bought 68.59 Bitcoin for $6.6 million as it attempts to deepen its crypto strategy. The company paid an average of $96,335 per BTC, bringing its total stash to 2,100 BTC, worth around $203 million. This means Metaplanet currently holds approximately 0.01% of the total BTC supply that will ever be mined. https://twitter.com/Metaplanet_JP/status/1892411162093900169 According to CoinGecko data, the Bitcoin price had reclaimed the $97,000 level at press time, having gained 1.4% in the past day. Notably, multinational bank Standard Chartered recently laid out its vision for how Bitcoin could rocket to as high as $500,000 before U.S. President Donald Trump leaves office. Metaplanet’s Dylan Le Clair revealed in an X post that the firm had raised $20 million in equity capital in the first two trading days of its “21 million plan”. In January, Metaplanet announced plans to raise more than 116 billion yen (around $745 million) to finance more Bitcoin buys. At the time, the little-known Japanese investment firm said its goal was to accumulate 10,000 BTC by Q4 2025, which would cost more than $1 billion. By Q4 2026, Metaplanet plans to boost its cache to 21,000 BTC, valued at roughly $2.1 billion. The company is copying the Bitcoin playbook established by American software firm MicroStrategy. In 2020, MicroStrategy started buying Bitcoin to give shareholders the best value for their money. Following its latest buy, the company now holds 478,740 BTC , which is valued above $46.5 billion. Metaplanet first purchased Bitcoin on April 8, 2024, adopting it as a core treasury asset to protect against currency depreciation. It is now Asia’s second-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin following Boyaa Interactive, which holds 3,183 Bitcoin worth $309 million. It’s worth mentioning that Strategy founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor has acknowledged Metaplanet’s latest BTC investment, defining its stash as “One Basis Point of Bitcoin.”",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Japan|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|ASIA|REGULATION|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-20 12:01:56
40584202,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131752,1740053051,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,China’s PBOC Holds Loan Prime Rate Unchanged – Impact on Crypto?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/china-lpr-rate-unchanged-crypto/,"In a move that echoes stability in the world’s second-largest economy, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has decided to maintain its Loan Prime Rate (LPR) unchanged. For those keenly watching the pulse of global finance, especially within the volatile cryptocurrency market, this decision carries significant weight. But what exactly does this mean, and how could it ripple through the crypto sphere? Let’s dive into the details of this crucial announcement. Decoding the PBOC’s Unchanged Loan Prime Rate For the fourth consecutive month, the PBOC has opted to keep the one-year LPR at 3.45% and the five-year LPR, which often influences mortgage rates, at 3.95%. This decision, announced on their official website, signals a continuation of China’s current monetary policy stance. The Loan Prime Rate (LPR) is not just another number; it’s a benchmark interest rate that significantly impacts borrowing costs for businesses and individuals across China. Think of it as the backbone of lending rates in the Chinese economy. Here’s a quick breakdown of what the LPR signifies: Benchmark Rate: The LPR serves as the primary reference rate for most new loans in China. Economic Indicator: Changes in the LPR reflect the PBOC’s monetary policy direction and its outlook on economic conditions. Market Influence: It directly impacts borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, influencing investment, spending, and overall economic activity. But why is this seemingly domestic decision so important for the global cryptocurrency market? Why China’s Interest Rates Matter to Crypto Even though cryptocurrency operates on a decentralized, global stage, macroeconomic factors, particularly from major economies like China, can exert considerable influence. China’s economic policies, especially those related to interest rates and liquidity, can indirectly affect crypto markets in several ways: Global Market Sentiment: China’s economic health is a significant indicator for global investors. A stable China LPR can be interpreted as a sign of economic stability, potentially fostering a more risk-on sentiment in global markets, including crypto. Conversely, unexpected rate hikes or economic instability in China could trigger risk aversion. Capital Flows: While China has strict capital controls, changes in interest rate differentials between China and other major economies can still influence capital flows. Stable rates might suggest a predictable economic environment, influencing investment decisions across borders. Demand for Alternative Assets: Economic uncertainty or currency fluctuations in major economies can sometimes drive investors towards alternative assets like cryptocurrencies as a hedge. While a stable PBOC rate decision suggests economic steadiness, prolonged periods of low growth or other economic anxieties could still indirectly boost crypto demand in the long run. To illustrate, consider a scenario where the PBOC unexpectedly increased the LPR. This could signal concerns about inflation or economic overheating in China. Investors might then react by: Reducing investments in riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, in the short term. Shifting focus towards more stable assets or currencies. Adjusting their global economic outlook based on perceived changes in China’s economic trajectory. Impact of Unchanged LPR: Stability or Stagnation? The decision to keep the China interest rates unchanged can be viewed from multiple angles. On one hand, it provides a sense of stability and predictability, which is generally welcomed by markets. Businesses and consumers can plan with a degree of certainty regarding borrowing costs. On the other hand, some economists might argue that maintaining rates at the current level might not be enough to stimulate robust economic growth, especially if the economy faces headwinds from global demand or domestic challenges. Let’s weigh the potential implications: Aspect Potential Positive Implications (Stability) Potential Negative Implications (Stagnation?) Business Investment Predictable borrowing costs encourage long-term investment. If rates are too high relative to economic growth, investment might still be subdued. Consumer Spending Stable mortgage rates can support the housing market and related consumer spending. If economic sentiment remains weak, unchanged rates alone might not boost consumer confidence significantly. Market Confidence Signals policy consistency and reduces uncertainty. Could be interpreted as a lack of proactive measures to stimulate growth if the economy slows down. Central Bank Policy China: A Global Balancing Act The PBOC’s monetary policy decisions are made within a complex global economic landscape. They need to balance domestic economic needs with external factors such as global inflation, exchange rate pressures, and the monetary policies of other major central banks. Keeping the central bank policy China consistent for four months suggests a cautious approach, possibly aimed at observing the effects of previous policy measures and navigating global economic uncertainties. Here are some key considerations for the PBOC: Inflation Management: Balancing the need to support growth with the risk of inflation. Exchange Rate Stability: Managing the value of the Yuan against other currencies, particularly the US dollar. Global Economic Conditions: Responding to global economic slowdowns, geopolitical risks, and supply chain disruptions. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors take away from this PBOC rate decision ? While the direct impact might not be immediate or dramatic, here are some actionable insights: Monitor Global Economic Indicators: Keep an eye on broader macroeconomic trends, including China’s economic data, alongside crypto-specific developments. Assess Risk Sentiment: Understand how global market sentiment, influenced by factors like China’s economic health, affects crypto market volatility. Diversify Your Portfolio: Macroeconomic factors highlight the importance of diversification. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially in a volatile market like crypto. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with financial news and analysis from reputable sources to make informed investment decisions. Conclusion: Navigating the Global Economic Currents The PBOC’s decision to hold the Loan Prime Rate unchanged is a significant signal of stability in the Chinese economy. While the direct link to cryptocurrency might seem indirect, the interconnectedness of global finance means that such decisions have far-reaching implications. For crypto investors, understanding these macroeconomic currents is crucial for navigating the market effectively. The steady hand of China’s central bank, for now, offers a degree of predictability in a world often characterized by volatility. However, vigilance and continuous monitoring of global economic developments remain paramount in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.

The news is yet another big step in the company’s expansion, which already includes partnerships with central banks. The crypto market has reacted positively to this development, which raised $XRP’s price in the past 48 hours . The development is also sure to increase the exposure of other ETFs in Brazil. This includes Solana ($SOL)—which has two ETFs in the country—as well as related projects like Solaxy ($SOLX). Let’s dive into the details below. $XRP Gains Added Exposure with ETF Approval Brazil’s CVM announced the approval of the $XRP spot ETF on February 18, the first of its kind worldwide. Formally known as the ‘Hashdex NASDAQ XRP Index Fund,’ the fund was established on December 10, 2024, and will be traded in B3, the country’s main stock exchange. With brokerage firm Genial Investimentos as its administrator, the $XRP ETF will allow investors to gain direct exposure to $XRP. This means they will be able to speculate on the digital currency’s price in the stock market without actually owning $XRP tokens. This will also facilitate investing in the token, as they can do this without using crypto wallets. There’s no information yet, however, regarding the ETF’s launch date. We’ll keep you posted as soon as it happens. A Major Win for $XRP and Other Cryptocurrencies The approval of the first $XRP spot ETF will certainly help with Ripple’s rapid expansion worldwide, as explained above. But on top of the ETF, the company has also partnered with 10 central banks —including Colombia, Georgia, and Montenegro—to help develop their respective Central Bank Digital Currencies. The CVM’s approval could also accelerate the confirmation of other $XRP ETFs currently under review in the US, such as Rex-Osprey $XRP ETF, Canary $XRP ETF, and 21Shares Core $XRP Trust. A more crypto-friendly US government will also increase the possibility of this approval. $XRP’s entry into the Brazilian stock exchange also reflected positively on the token’s price. As of writing, XRP is at $2.69 after bottoming out at $2.12 on February 3. $XRP Approval Bodes Well for Solana and Solaxy The $XRP spot ETF is only one of several crypto ETFs in Brazil. Solana has two such funds, one offered by Brazilian asset manager QR Asset, and the other under Hashdex, which also manages the $XRP, as well as $BTC and $ETH funds. Both $SOL ETFs were approved in August 2024. QR Asset’s spot ETF raised $2.75M during its initial public offering in the same month. The second $SOL ETF, meanwhile, is currently in its pre-operational phase. Once both Solana-based funds start trading, we can expect $SOL’s visibility and value to increase further. $SOL’s wider availability would also benefit meme coins at large, particularly Solaxy ($SOLX) . It’s a Solana Layer 2 blockchain that aims to solve common issues with Solana, including failed transactions, network congestion, and high fees. How does it aim to achieve all that? Through Roll-Up Technology, which bundles transactions together and processes them off-chain, making the entire process more efficient. And if you were wondering about a lapse in security because of this, don’t. Solaxy will finalize the transactions on Solana, which means the transactions will inherit the blockchain’s awesome security. The $SOLX token is currently on presale, which will allow you to invest in the project and hedge on Solana’s success without waiting for $SOL to trade in Brazil’s stock exchange. To date, the project has already raised $22.4M, which makes it one of the best crypto presales of 2025. To get started, you’ll need to get a crypto wallet like Best Wallet and connect it to the presale widget on Solaxy’s website. After that, you can buy $SOLX with crypto or fiat currency. You’ll receive the tokens once the presale ends. Alternatively, you can stake them. This means locking $SOLX in a staking wallet for a set amount of time, giving you the opportunity to earn passive income (the APY is currently 181%). $SOLX is still affordable at only $0.00164 each. Another price increase will happen in less than 10 hours, though, so it’s best to buy tokens as soon as you can. Research Before You Invest Crypto trading can be highly volatile. This means there’s a huge potential for you to either lose or gain from your investment. Because of this, always do your own research before you buy crypto, and never invest money you’re not ready to lose. Also, speak with a financial advisor if you’re considering buying crypto.

If/when Bitcoin finally turns that corner and heads into the next phase of its bull market, a sizable altcoin rally may not be far behind it. Total2 chart suggests it’s not over for altcoins Source: TradingView Total2 is the chart of the market capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies, excluding $BTC. The chart shows that the market cap of the altcoins is clawing its way back above the strong horizontal support band that stretches from $1.18 trillion, to $1.22 trillion. This horizontal support band coincides with the top of the 2024 bull flag, and is therefore an ideal place for a recommencement of the rally. What’s more, a very long candle wick two weeks ago went all the way down to confirm a rising trendline before being bought back up with alacrity. Finally, the Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart shows that the indicator lines are bottoming. The bull market for altcoins is not over. OTHERS chart displays higher highs and higher lows Source: TradingView The OTHERS chart tracks the market capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies, excluding those in the TOP 10. So this would exclude $BTC, $ETH, $XRP, $BNB, $SOL, $USDT etc. Therefore this chart is able to give the big picture for the medium to small cap cryptos. As can be seen in the chart, the market cap did fall all the way to the deepest Fibonacci level of 0.786, at $216 billion. However, this was very short-lived, and the market cap has stabilised above the 0.618 Fibonacci. With a higher high already made, and what looks to be an almost certain higher low being put in, the next rally has the potential to go higher still, and perhaps take out the $492 billion all-time high of the previous bull market.

When Bitcoin gains traction in its anticipated bull run, altcoins are expected to mirror this momentum with substantial gains. Analyzing the Total2 Chart: A Beacon of Hope for Altcoins The Total2 chart offers a snapshot of the collective market cap of cryptocurrencies, minus Bitcoin. It highlights a recovery, breaking past a critical support zone between $1.18 trillion and $1.22 trillion. Positioned at this crucial level, there's potential for the rally to reignite. Notably, a significant price action recently touched the rising trendline before rebounding, a promising sign for investors. Additionally, the Stochastic RSI at the chart's base indicates a bottoming pattern. This suggests the altcoin market could be gearing up for a bullish trend. Growth Patterns in the OTHERS Chart The OTHERS chart captures the dynamics of all cryptocurrencies except for the top 10, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, showcasing the outlook for smaller cap cryptos. The market cap had briefly dipped to a significant Fibonacci level of 0.786 at $216 billion but swiftly recovered. It now maintains above the 0.618 Fibonacci level, forming higher highs and lows.

The political landscape just took a dramatic turn, potentially signaling a seismic shift in the future of digital assets in the United States. Former President Donald Trump has boldly claimed to have ended what he terms President Joe Biden’s ‘war on cryptocurrency.’ This sensational announcement, initially reported by Tree News citing Bloomberg, has sent ripples through the crypto community and beyond. But what does this declaration really mean? Is it just political rhetoric, or does it herald a genuine change in U.S. crypto policy? Let’s dive into the details and explore the potential implications of this electrifying development. Decoding Trump’s Crypto Policy Stance: What Changed? For years, the cryptocurrency industry has navigated a complex and often uncertain regulatory environment in the U.S. While there hasn’t been a formally declared ‘war,’ many in the crypto space have perceived a lack of clarity and, at times, a hostile stance from certain regulatory bodies under the Biden administration. Concerns have revolved around: Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear guidelines on cryptocurrency classification (security vs. commodity), taxation, and operational frameworks has been a major hurdle. Businesses struggled to comply without knowing the definitive rules of the game. Enforcement Actions: Several high-profile enforcement actions against crypto firms by agencies like the SEC and CFTC have been interpreted by some as aggressive and stifling innovation. Presidential Tone: While not explicitly anti-crypto, the Biden administration’s public statements and appointments haven’t always projected strong support for the industry, leading to speculation about its overall stance. Trump’s recent statement, therefore, can be seen as a direct counterpoint to this perceived environment. By declaring an end to the ‘war on crypto,’ he is signaling a potentially more welcoming and supportive approach should he regain the presidency. This is a significant departure and could represent a major policy shift. But what exactly might this new Trump crypto policy look like? Biden’s Crypto War: Was There Really a Conflict? Before we jump to conclusions, it’s important to analyze the context. Was there actually a ‘ Biden crypto war ‘? The term itself is arguably hyperbole, but it reflects a sentiment within the crypto community. Here’s a balanced perspective: Perspective Details ‘War on Crypto’ View Increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions. Lack of clear, proactive crypto-friendly legislation. Concerns about innovation being stifled by over-regulation. Negative rhetoric (perceived or real) creating a chilling effect. Regulatory Prudence View Need to protect consumers from scams and fraud in a nascent market. Ensuring financial stability and preventing illicit activities (money laundering, terrorism financing). Gradual approach to regulation to understand the technology and its risks fully. Balancing innovation with responsible growth. It’s likely that the ‘war on crypto’ narrative is a simplification of the complex relationship between regulators and a rapidly evolving industry. However, Trump’s statement effectively taps into the anxieties and frustrations felt by many in the crypto space who desire a more favorable regulatory climate. Bitcoin Regulation: A New Era of Support? Trump specifically mentioned Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in his statement. This is noteworthy as Bitcoin regulation has been a central point of debate. What could Trump’s declared ‘end to the war’ mean for the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market? Reduced Regulatory Pressure: This could translate to less aggressive enforcement actions and a more collaborative approach between regulators and the industry. Pro-Innovation Policies: A Trump administration might prioritize policies that encourage crypto innovation and adoption in the U.S., potentially making it a more attractive hub for crypto businesses. Clearer Regulatory Framework: While seemingly contradictory to ‘less regulation,’ a truly supportive stance might involve pushing for a clear and comprehensive regulatory framework that provides certainty and allows for responsible growth. This is what the industry has been asking for. Potential for Bitcoin Adoption: A more positive regulatory environment could pave the way for increased institutional and retail adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It’s important to remember that these are potential outcomes based on a single statement. The actual implementation of policy is a complex process involving various government agencies and legislative bodies. Cryptocurrency Support: Beyond Bitcoin – Altcoins and Innovation While Bitcoin is the flagship cryptocurrency, the broader ecosystem encompasses thousands of other digital assets and innovative projects. Does Trump’s statement extend to general cryptocurrency support , or is it narrowly focused on Bitcoin? It’s reasonable to assume that ‘cryptocurrency’ in Trump’s statement is meant to be inclusive of the wider digital asset space. A pro-crypto stance would likely benefit not just Bitcoin, but also: Ethereum and Smart Contracts: Platforms enabling decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) could thrive with a more supportive regulatory environment. Stablecoins: These digital currencies pegged to fiat currencies are crucial for crypto trading and payments. Clearer regulations around stablecoins are highly anticipated. NFTs and the Metaverse: Non-fungible tokens and metaverse projects could see increased investment and development with a more innovation-friendly approach. Blockchain Innovation: The underlying blockchain technology powering cryptocurrencies has vast potential beyond finance, across supply chains, healthcare, and more. Supportive policies could unlock broader blockchain innovation. However, it’s crucial to note that ‘support’ doesn’t mean a complete lack of regulation. Responsible growth requires a balanced approach that fosters innovation while mitigating risks. The Future of Digital Assets: What Lies Ahead? Trump’s declaration has undoubtedly injected a new element of excitement and hope into the crypto market. But what does the digital asset future truly hold? Here are some key questions and considerations: Election Outcome: The most immediate factor is the upcoming US presidential election. Trump’s statement is clearly politically motivated, and its impact hinges on whether he wins the election. Policy Details: Vague statements are one thing; concrete policy proposals are another. The crypto community will be keenly watching for specific policy outlines from Trump regarding regulation, taxation, and innovation. Regulatory Response: Even if Trump wins, regulatory agencies like the SEC and CFTC have their own mandates and processes. The actual shift in regulatory approach might be gradual and nuanced. Global Impact: US crypto policy has global ramifications. A more crypto-friendly stance in the US could influence regulatory approaches in other countries and attract international crypto businesses. Market Volatility: Political statements can trigger market volatility. Crypto prices may react sharply to developments related to Trump’s crypto stance, creating both opportunities and risks for investors. In conclusion, Donald Trump’s claim to have ended Biden’s ‘war on crypto’ is a bold and potentially transformative statement. It signals a possible shift towards a more supportive regulatory environment for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in the United States. While the actual impact remains to be seen and depends on numerous factors, this development has undoubtedly energized the crypto community and sparked a crucial conversation about the future of digital assets. The coming months will be critical in determining whether this declaration translates into a genuine new era for crypto innovation and adoption.

While the company is constantly in talks with Deribit over its acquisition. At the same time, it is facing growing pressure from U.S. regulators, including the FBI and SEC, to share client data. Kraken Still Negotiating to Buy Deribit Deribit, a major crypto options exchange, is still in discussions with Kraken regarding a potential acquisition. Despite reports suggesting Kraken had backed out, sources confirm the negotiations are still ongoing. As per the sources, Deribit Exhcangs is valued between $4 billion and $5 billion, and remains a key player in the options market, making it an attractive target for expansion. If Kraken successfully acquires Deribit, it could strengthen its position in the crypto derivatives market, giving it an edge over rivals. Coinbase Joins the Acquisition Deal Kraken is not the exchange interested in Deribit. Coinbase has also shown interest in acquiring the platform, adding more competition to the deal. However, Deribit’s CEO has clarified that the company is still evaluating multiple takeover bids, keeping its options open. U.S. Regulators Demand Kraken’s User Data While Kraken is in acquisition talks, it is also dealing with pressure from U.S. regulators. The FBI and SEC are among several agencies requesting client data from Kraken in 2024. However, a transparency report revealed that Kraken received 6,826 data requests from global authorities, with 57% of them coming from U.S. regulators. The SEC, which previously sued Kraken for allegedly operating an unregistered exchange, accounted for 37% of the U.S. requests. Other agencies, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, have also demanded information from Kraken. Kraken’s Growth Despite Challenges Despite regulatory challenges, Kraken’s business remains strong. The exchange reported $1.5 billion in revenue in 2024, marking a 128% increase from the previous year. While it faces hurdles in the US, Kraken’s expansion efforts, including a potential Deribit acquisition, could shape its future in the crypto industry.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET|COMMODITY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-20 12:13:45

This isn’t just dipping a toe in the water; it’s a full-fledged dive, indicating a serious commitment to the future of finance. For crypto enthusiasts and industry observers alike, this development from one of South Korea’s major banks is a significant bellwether for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption . What is Shinhan Bank’s Crypto Task Force and Why Does it Matter? Shinhan Bank’s newly established Crypto Task Force is not a small, experimental team. It’s a robust 16-member unit specifically designed to navigate and capitalize on the burgeoning virtual asset landscape. According to MTN News, this initiative is deeply rooted in Shinhan’s strategic vision to secure a leading position in the rapidly evolving crypto market. But what exactly will this task force be doing? Strengthening Ties with Korbit: Shinhan Bank already plays a crucial role in the South Korean crypto ecosystem by providing real-name bank accounts to the cryptocurrency exchange Korbit. The task force will work to deepen this partnership, likely exploring new avenues for collaboration and integration. Boosting Marketing Efforts: A key objective is to amplify marketing initiatives related to virtual assets. This suggests Shinhan Bank is not just passively observing the market but actively seeking to engage and attract customers interested in crypto services. Enhancing Collaboration with KDAC: Korea Digital Asset Custody (KDAC) is a significant player in the crypto custody space, and Shinhan Bank was instrumental in its establishment. The task force aims to further strengthen this relationship, potentially leading to innovative custody solutions and services. South Korean Banks Embrace Virtual Assets: A Sign of Maturing Market? Shinhan Bank’s proactive approach is indicative of a broader trend among South Korean Banks . South Korea has consistently been a hotbed for cryptocurrency activity, with high adoption rates and a vibrant trading market. However, the regulatory landscape has also been evolving, demanding that traditional financial institutions engage with virtual assets in a compliant and strategic manner. Here’s why Shinhan Bank’s move is particularly noteworthy in the South Korean context: Aspect Significance Major Financial Institution Shinhan Bank is not a small player; its involvement lends credibility and legitimacy to the crypto sector in South Korea. Proactive Task Force This isn’t a reactive measure to regulatory changes but a proactive strategy to lead and innovate within the virtual asset space. Partnerships Deepening ties with Korbit and KDAC showcases a collaborative approach, leveraging existing expertise in the crypto industry. This initiative suggests that South Korean banks are moving beyond cautious observation and are now actively seeking to integrate virtual assets into their core business strategies. This could pave the way for more traditional financial institutions in South Korea and globally to follow suit. Driving Cryptocurrency Adoption: What Does This Mean for the Future? Shinhan Bank’s entry into the crypto arena has significant implications for Cryptocurrency Adoption in South Korea and potentially worldwide. When established financial institutions embrace digital currencies, it sends a powerful message to the public and other organizations. Consider these potential impacts: Increased Trust and Accessibility: Bank involvement can increase public trust in cryptocurrencies. It makes crypto services more accessible to a wider audience who are already comfortable banking with traditional institutions like Shinhan. Innovation in Financial Products: With a dedicated task force, Shinhan Bank is likely to explore and develop new financial products and services centered around cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. This could range from crypto-backed loans to innovative investment vehicles. Regulatory Influence: As a major player, Shinhan Bank’s engagement can also influence the regulatory dialogue around cryptocurrencies in South Korea, potentially leading to more pragmatic and supportive policies. Ultimately, the involvement of banks like Shinhan can act as a catalyst for broader cryptocurrency adoption , moving digital currencies further into the mainstream financial system. The Rise of Digital Finance: Shinhan Bank’s Vision Shinhan Bank’s move is not just about capitalizing on a trend; it reflects a larger shift towards Digital Finance . The lines between traditional finance and the crypto world are increasingly blurring, and institutions that recognize and adapt to this change are likely to thrive in the future. What could this mean for the future of finance? Integration of Crypto Services: We can expect to see more traditional banking services integrating crypto functionalities, such as buying, selling, and custody of digital assets directly through bank platforms. Blockchain-Based Solutions: Banks might increasingly leverage blockchain technology to enhance efficiency, security, and transparency in various financial operations, from payments to supply chain finance.

AI agents are emerging as powerful tools in the web3 space, offering the potential to automate complex tasks, analyze vast data sets in the blink of an eye, and transform how users interact with blockchain ecosystems. By enhancing efficiency and accessibility, these agents are reshaping decentralized systems and empowering individuals to engage with blockchain technology—once seen as too technical and inaccessible for many. You might also like: Agents present a Netscape moment for AI and crypto | Opinion With AI projected to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, its influence on industries like decentralized finance is impossible to ignore. But with these advancements come critical questions: How do we ensure that AI agents remain accountable? Can they truly operate autonomously, and if so, to what extent should they be allowed to? As blockchain and AI converge, striking the right balance between innovation and oversight will be the key to determining whether this evolution drives progress or creates new vulnerabilities. Simplifying blockchain adoption with AI agents Building on this convergence of AI and blockchain, AI agents are already reshaping the way decentralized ecosystems function. In decentralized finance, for instance, these agents are automating complex tasks like liquidity management and yield optimization, driving smarter decision-making and unprecedented efficiency. Platforms like Fetch.ai are taking this innovation further, using AI to streamline logistics and simplify workflows, turning blockchain’s steep learning curve into an intuitive experience. These agents don’t just enhance systems—they act as “Intuitive Guides,” helping users navigate blockchain’s complexities and making it accessible to a much wider audience. This isn’t just a technological leap; it’s an economic one, too. With AI projected to contribute a staggering $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, more than the combined output of India and China, its integration into blockchain has fundamentally changed how this technology operates. What was once a domain reserved for tech enthusiasts is now evolving into something practical, inclusive, and scalable. By lowering the barriers to entry, AI agents are transforming blockchain into a tool for everyone, setting the stage for a decentralized future that is both innovative and accessible. Potential guardians of blockchain security? AI agents are emerging as potential sentinels of blockchain security, capable of identifying fraud and anomalies with unmatched speed and precision. Valued at around $10 billion, the crypto AI agent market is rapidly growing, and these agents are proving indispensable in safeguarding decentralized ecosystems. Operating autonomously, they can monitor transactions 24/7, analyze massive datasets, and detect threats in real-time—tasks that would overwhelm even the most skilled human teams. Beyond security, their ability to assess sentiment, trading patterns, and market conditions makes them invaluable for both trading and reinforcing blockchain security on a broader scale. However, this immense potential comes with significant risks. AI agents are only as trustworthy as the data they’re trained on, and adversarial attacks where malicious data corrupts their behavior—highlight the vulnerabilities they face. Without robust safeguards, these agents could inadvertently become tools for exploitation. To harness their capabilities effectively, it’s essential to implement rigorous algorithms, continuous monitoring, and regular system updates. By combining advanced AI with human oversight, we can ensure these agents not only strengthen blockchain security but also uphold the transparency and trust that decentralized ecosystems depend on. Balancing autonomy and accountability While AI agents hold immense promise, their effectiveness hinges on striking the right balance between autonomy and accountability. Without proper oversight, even the most advanced AI agents are vulnerable to producing flawed or biased outcomes, especially if trained on poor-quality data. Research reveals that 85% of AI systems fail due to subpar data quality, underscoring the urgent need for regular audits, transparent algorithms, and robust safeguards. In decentralized ecosystems, where transparency and accountability form the bedrock, the reliability of AI agents becomes even more critical. Poor data quality doesn’t just hinder the performance of AI agents—it poses a direct threat to the trust and transparency that decentralized systems depend on. For blockchain to maintain its promise of fairness and integrity, human oversight must remain a key component of AI integration. This means ensuring that AI systems are built on solid, unbiased data and that their processes are continuously monitored to prevent misuse or unintended consequences. By maintaining this balance, we can harness the efficiency of AI agents while safeguarding the ethical foundations that make decentralized ecosystems revolutionary. The future of AI agents in blockchain AI agents hold the power to redefine blockchain’s foundations, introducing unprecedented levels of efficiency, enhanced user engagement, and strengthened security. But their transformative potential hinges on our ability to strike a delicate balance between autonomy and accountability. As we navigate this technological evolution, the focus must remain on building systems that not only push boundaries but also protect the foundational principles of transparency and trust. By doing so, we can ensure AI agents empower users while paving the way for a future where blockchain is truly accessible, secure, and inclusive.

This unexpected move has injected a dose of uncertainty into the market, leaving industry players and investors alike wondering about the future trajectory of digital asset regulation in the country. Let’s delve into the details of this decision and explore what it means for the future of korea crypto regulation . Why the Delay in Security Token Bill Korea? According to reports from MoneyToday, a South Korean parliamentary official revealed that the much-anticipated security token bill korea was notably absent from the agenda of the National Policy Committee’s Subcommittee on Legislation Review. This subcommittee plays a pivotal role in shaping the legislative landscape of the nation, and its decision to sideline the bill, for now, speaks volumes. Committee members cited concerns that it was simply “too early” to tackle this complex issue within the current parliamentary session. While this might sound like a vague reason, it underscores a cautious approach from lawmakers who are navigating the novel and often intricate world of digital assets. The official further elaborated that there is a prevailing sentiment within the committee to approach this matter with due diligence, emphasizing the need to gather a broader spectrum of perspectives from various stakeholders. This includes actively seeking input from industry experts through avenues such as public hearings. The intention is to holistically consider the security token bill korea in conjunction with other pieces of virtual asset legislation currently under consideration. Decoding Security Tokens and Why Regulation Matters Before we proceed, let’s quickly understand what security tokens are and why their regulation is so crucial in the digital asset ecosystem. What are Security Tokens? : Unlike utility tokens that grant access to a product or service, security tokens represent ownership or rights to an asset, similar to traditional securities like stocks or bonds. They are essentially digital representations of financial instruments, leveraging blockchain technology for enhanced transparency and efficiency. Why Regulate Them? : The regulatory framework for security tokens is paramount for investor protection, market integrity, and fostering innovation. Clear guidelines help prevent fraud, ensure fair trading practices, and provide legal certainty for businesses operating in this space. Without proper regulation, the growth and adoption of security tokens could be hampered, stifling potential economic benefits. The Broader Landscape of Korea Crypto Regulation South Korea has been at the forefront of cryptocurrency adoption and innovation. The nation has witnessed significant interest and investment in digital assets, making it a key market in the global crypto landscape. However, the regulatory approach has been evolving, reflecting a global trend of governments grappling with how to best manage this nascent asset class. The current move to delay the security token regulation korea discussion should be viewed within the broader context of korea crypto regulation . The government has been actively working on establishing a comprehensive legal framework for virtual assets. This includes measures to combat money laundering, protect consumers, and ensure fair market practices. The decision to postpone the security token bill could indicate a desire to synchronize its implementation with other ongoing legislative efforts in the virtual asset domain. Korean Parliament Crypto Stance: A Cautious Approach? The korean parliament crypto stance, as reflected in this recent decision, seems to lean towards a cautious and deliberative approach. While the delay might be perceived as a setback by some, it also signals a commitment to thoroughness and inclusivity. The emphasis on gathering more opinions and holding public hearings suggests that lawmakers are keen to understand the nuances of the security token market and craft legislation that is both effective and conducive to innovation. This cautious approach could be attributed to several factors: Factor Description Complexity of Digital Assets Security tokens and the underlying blockchain technology are complex subjects. Lawmakers need time to fully grasp the technical and economic implications. Global Regulatory Landscape The global regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving. South Korea might be waiting to see how other jurisdictions are approaching security token regulation to adopt best practices. Balancing Innovation and Risk The government needs to strike a balance between fostering innovation in the digital asset space and mitigating potential risks associated with it, such as fraud and market manipulation. Virtual Asset Legislation Korea: What’s on the Horizon? Despite the delay in the security token bill korea , the broader momentum towards virtual asset legislation korea remains strong. The official’s statement clearly indicates that the committee intends to revisit the security token issue in conjunction with other virtual asset legislation. This suggests that we can expect further developments in the regulatory landscape in the near future. Here’s what we can anticipate: Public Hearings and Industry Input : Expect increased engagement with industry stakeholders through public hearings and consultations. This will provide a platform for businesses, experts, and the public to voice their opinions and contribute to shaping the regulatory framework. Comprehensive Virtual Asset Law : The ultimate goal appears to be the creation of a comprehensive virtual asset law that encompasses various aspects of digital assets, including security tokens, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs. This holistic approach aims to provide clarity and legal certainty across the entire digital asset spectrum. Phased Implementation : Given the complexity, the implementation of virtual asset legislation korea might be phased. The government may choose to address the most pressing issues first and gradually expand the regulatory scope over time. Implications of the Delayed Security Token Bill The decision to delay the security token bill korea has several potential implications for the digital asset industry in South Korea and beyond: Uncertainty for Businesses : The lack of clear regulatory guidelines creates uncertainty for businesses looking to issue or trade security tokens in South Korea. This could potentially slow down investment and innovation in this area. Wait-and-See Approach : Some businesses might adopt a wait-and-see approach, delaying their entry into the security token market until greater regulatory clarity emerges. Opportunity for Refinement : On a positive note, the delay provides an opportunity to refine the bill, incorporate industry feedback, and learn from global best practices. This could ultimately lead to a more robust and effective regulatory framework. Conclusion: Navigating the Uncertainties of Korea Crypto Regulation The postponement of the security token regulation korea discussion by the South Korean parliament injects a degree of uncertainty into the nation’s digital asset landscape. While the delay might be seen as a temporary setback, it also reflects a cautious and deliberate approach by lawmakers. Their commitment to gathering diverse opinions and considering the bill within the broader context of virtual asset legislation korea suggests a long-term vision for a comprehensive and well-considered regulatory framework. For industry participants, navigating this period of uncertainty requires adaptability, proactive engagement with regulators, and a keen eye on the evolving developments in korea crypto regulation . The future of security tokens in South Korea remains in flux, but the ongoing dialogue and legislative efforts signal a continued journey towards establishing a robust and innovative digital asset ecosystem.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a credible option by blending practical applications with an accessible cost, proving it is more than just another low-priced token. With its commitment to decentralized lending and a straightforward approach, Mutuum Finance attracts both experienced and newer investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance ’s first presale phase is generating considerable enthusiasm, as it has already raised over $870,000 in just two weeks and attracted more than 1,600 holders. The token is currently priced at $0.01, and the first phase is selling out quickly. Once it concludes, the price is set to jump by 1.5x to $0.015, which underscores the urgency for those seeking an early entry. Many investors view Mutuum Finance’s quick fundraising and growing community as strong indicators of its near-term potential. A core feature that draws investors to Mutuum Finance is its decentralized lending protocol, which removes the need for intermediaries. Users can supply crypto assets to liquidity pools and, in return, receive mtTokens that appreciate in value over time. This structure provides a reliable avenue for passive income while ensuring individuals retain full control over their assets. On the borrowing side, users can access liquidity by offering collateral, benefiting from a transparent and efficient process governed by audited smart contracts. Beyond the main lending pools, Mutuum Finance also supports peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions. This direct model offers broader flexibility, enabling the supply or borrowing of various tokens that may not be available in the peer-to-contract pools. For example, meme coins such as Pepe (PEPE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), or Dogecoin (DOGE) can be included, catering to users who prefer niche markets or aim to diversify their lending and borrowing opportunities. Mutuum Finance employs a buy and distribute mechanism to maintain consistent demand for MUTM and support its value. A portion of platform fees is set aside to repurchase tokens from the market, which are then allocated to platform participants. This approach bolsters price growth potential and provides ongoing rewards to users who remain engaged with the project. When users deposit crypto assets into Mutuum’s lending pools, they receive mtTokens that represent their supplied amount plus accumulated interest. As the platform’s lending activity grows, these mtTokens steadily gain redemption value. Holders can later exchange mtTokens back for the original asset plus the earned interest, allowing them to increase their cryptocurrency holdings without active trading. Another important element in Mutuum Finance’s ecosystem is the planned overcollateralized stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar. This stablecoin will serve as a practical means of exchange within the platform, adding liquidity and stability while integrating seamlessly with the lending and borrowing services. By introducing a stable asset, Mutuum Finance aims to create a more predictable environment for users who prefer to reduce volatility when supplying or borrowing assets. The development team is committed to ensuring user protection and confidence. Mutuum Finance’s smart contracts will be audited by a well-known company, a detail that many investors consider vital when choosing new projects. This thorough review will help uphold the platform’s integrity, reinforcing trust for both lenders and borrowers. Roadmap Overview Mutuum Finance’s development is organized into four main stages. Phase 1 sets the project in motion by starting the presale, rolling out marketing efforts, conducting an external audit, and forming a dedicated legal and compliance team. Phase 2 focuses on building the core smart contract, the DApp front end, the back-end infrastructure, and introducing advanced features with ongoing quality reviews. Phase 3 addresses bug reporting, Testnet trials, finalizing the demo version, preparing for exchange listings, meeting regulatory standards, and wrapping up the presale. Phase 4 features the live platform launch, listing MUTM on exchanges, activating the claim process, initiating a bug bounty program, and broadening the platform’s reach across multiple blockchain networks. Shortly after its official launch, Mutuum Finance plans to introduce a beta version of the lending platform, granting users direct access to its core features. Many observers predict that once the platform goes live, widespread user adoption and the range of planned features will drive MUTM from its $0.01 presale price toward $0.20 in a relatively short period, offering a 20x return for early supporters. By acquiring tokens at the current $0.01 entry point, holders position themselves to benefit from the project’s forthcoming expansion. Combining a decentralized lending model, flexible P2P options, stablecoin integration, and a clear roadmap, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a prime hidden gem under $0.01.

One such considerable rally happened when OM token price skyrocketed more than 3000% in the last one year, benefiting its holders significantly. However, one crypto investor stood out, who turned $378k into $50.64M, with a 900% surge in just 9 months. Let’s discuss how this happened and what’s coming next for this Mantra token. Crypto Investor Profits $50.64M With OM Token Price Rally Around nine months ago, a crypto investor (Magnifold Trading X handle) went big on the Mantra token, investing $387K. At that time, the investor bought 9.33M OM at an average value of $0.04. However, the OM token price rose high with time, surging by 900% in this interval and turning this investor’s holding into $50.64M profits. Out of these, the crypto trader has already sold 4M tokens for $13.27M and is still holding the remaining. The Data Nerd Guy claims his profit on this overall investment would be $50.64M if he sells at the current Mantra price. The trader has held his token for nine months despite OM hitting ATH just a few days ago. This long-term holding indicates his trust in the altcoin. With the same trust, his investment returns have become 134x. If he continues to hold and the price grows, his returns may grow even higher. OM Token Price Rally: What’s Driving the Surge? Mantra is the 22nd biggest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of $7.14B. However, the token has not always maintained a high stand, as its price struggled for years before making a breakthrough in 2024. With that, the OM token price rallied 3000%, with a 105% surge in the last month. During this period, the Mantra token reached a new ATH of $7.95 four days ago and is currently trading at $7.33. This significant surge came with the token’s consistent growth, with the most recent milestone being acquiring the Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). This boosted Mantra token holders’ confidence, favoring a price rally. However, some analysts call this just the beginning before predicting a higher target. Will the Mantra token Hit $15? Most OM price predictions claim to see a further rally to the $15 target or higher after its recent milestones. Rache Crypto, a renowned crypto analyst, claims that the OM is moving per expectation, and if it continues, the next target would be $15. Another analyst anticipates $20, but some restrict it to only $8.5. However, there are also signs of a short-term pullback, so investors must be cautious about trend changes. Bottom Line The Mantra token price rally is among the most bullish things seen in the market. However, analysts believe this is just the start. Some even anticipate a further rally or its positioning in the top 10 cryptos of the market. However, depending on various factors, that may or may not happen. For now, the OM token price is $7.33 after facing short-term consolidation. However, despite that, it has made $50.64M for a crypto investor. The valuation will be higher if this investor doesn’t sell and the price increases.

With the campaign, Supra promises more MultiVM support, more advanced in-protocol oracles, native on-chain randomness, cross-chain communication, and additional automation capabilities. These advancements — auto-liquidations, automated arbitrage, and network-wide automation — aren’t incremental improvements. They're redefining DeFi in an entirely new way. This is the foundation of The DeFi Revolution, and it belongs to all of you. https://t.co/8W0Yg4sPSJ — Supra (@SUPRA_Labs) February 20, 2025 Supra’s automation framework The integration enables auto-arbitrage, auto-liquidations, and Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) protection at the chain level, which makes it impossible for external liquidators, arbitrageurs, and MEV exploiters to extract value from the ecosystem. Joshua Tobkin, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Co-Founder of Supra, summarized the primary goal of the initiative: “This so-called ‘DeFi’ landscape has deep flaws—but with Supra’s fully integrated stack, we’re giving builders the tools to take back control, increase execution quality, and create a DeFi ecosystem that works for them.” With auto-arbitrage functionalities, trades are executed at the protocol level, which means tighter spreads, better prices, and profits that remain within the ecosystem. On the other hand, auto-liquidations enable zero-block delay liquidations to prevent cascading failures and ensure protocol solvency. Meanwhile, MEV resistance randomizes transaction ordering using cryptographic threshold signatures to mitigate cybersecurity threats such as front-running and sandwich attacks. As a result, Supra’s automation framework can focus on facilitating DeFi transactions first and foremost. A new revenue model on Supra Beyond more efficient transactions, the innovations discussed above are also expected to contribute to an entirely new revenue model. Namely, all value generated by automated processes on the network will be dedicated to improving two core areas on Supra. First, a revenue-sharing model will distribute earnings across decentralized apps (dApps), node operators, and the treasury. Second, a decentralized network treasury fully managed by the community itself will ensure sustainable growth and promote constant reinvestment in the ecosystem. According to Tobkin, the new automated execution systems will thus work on ensuring “fairer transactions, better liquidity, and stronger DeFi incentives.” The post Supra launches its DeFi Revolution campaign appeared first on Finbold .",Cryptocurrency news|crypto|cryptocurrency|DeFi,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'Finbold', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",finbold,2025-02-20 12:20:44

Mansa, the 2024-founded liquidity solutions provider for global payments, also saw investment in its vision from Faculty Group, Octerra, Trive Digital. The other $7M was received in liquidity funding from institutions like corporate investors, quantitative funds, and alternative investment firms. Mansa, which is currently providing its payment services to Africa region mainly, is set to use the received funding for expansion into Latin America and Southeast Asia. The later regions have witnessed delayed processing of cross-border payments due to liquidity issues – perhaps MANSA can work as a solution there. Mansa – Real-time Liquidity Payments Solution Stablecoins now worth a $205 billion market are fast-growing as a method for cross-border payments, offering real-time settlement and hussle-free transactions. Mansa provides liquidity to the largest companies across the payments ecosystem including to B2B/remittance companies, OTC Desks & Forex, Virtual Card Processers and Stablecoin infrastructure. The company’s innovative use of stablecoins reduces settlement delays and transaction costs, providing payment providers with the resources to scale their operations efficiently. With less than a year since its launch, MANSA has processed over $27 million in transaction volume, with nearly $11 million occurring in January 2025 alone—a 574% growth since August 2024. https://x.com/MANSA_FI/status/1892497244592435538 One of the investors, Polymorphic Capital, highlighted the key features of MANSA that the investors have found innovative and futuristic, viz., Mansa focuses on real-time payments liquidity as it directly finances the underlying payment, providing a short-term revolving line of credit in stablecoins. Its innovative approach enables LPs to earn with higher APYs, and have in-house underwriting and legal claims. It uses stablecoins and DeFi to provide access to onchain funding and streamline settlements. It combines blockchain technology with a meticulous risk management approach, ensuring transparency and security to enable instant liquidity. Stablecoins driven cross-border payments The exponentially growing method making cross-border payments using stablecoins settle transactions in minutes on Blockchain networks. The lagging caused by banking hours and different timezones also gets eliminated. Since international transactions are associated with high fees, transactions by stablecoins have much lower fees. The average cost for a $200 tranfer costs 6.25% indicating $12.70 per transaction by conventional channels. However, using stablecoins for remittances significantly reduces fees, averaging between 0.5% to 3.0% of the transfer amount. This means a $200 transfer could cost as little as $1. According to a Coinbase report, in 2023, stablecoins facilitated approximately $10.8 trillion in transactions with $2.3 trillion of this volume attributed to organic activities, including payments and cross-border remittances. As of November 2024, the combined market capitalization of stablecoins reached a record $190 billion, marking a 46% increase from the previous year. Popular Stablecoins for Cross-Border Payments remain USDT (Tether), USDC (USD Coin), and DAI. Countries such as Mexico and Brazil are receiving significant amount of remittances ( $63.3 billion) processed by stablecoins, thus, benefitting Businesses, merchants, remote workers, investors, migrants, among others. With projects like Mansa aiming for further expansion and development, the cross-border payment solution can indeed ‘transform the way money moves’.

With the market heating up, investors are keen to find the top altcoins to invest in right now. This article unveils five promising options that could deliver impressive returns in this vibrant landscape. Highlighted in this investment lineup are established coins like Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and Polkadot (DOT). Also making waves is an emerging contender, Agent A.I., a memecoin with a humorous twist that aims to break barriers. The time to act is now as these picks promise to be game-changers. Agent A.I. (Undercover Pepe) - the Next Top 10 Meme Coin? In a crypto space flooded with AI buzzwords, most projects fail to deliver. Pepe Agent A.I. has come to denounce fake AI agents and bring real intelligence to the crypto realm. It plans to use AI to track trends, analyze data, and give traders useful insights. Operating under the alias Artificial Idiot, Agent A.I. navigates meme coin chaos, identifying the most relevant and promising projects. Its mascot—modeled after Pepe the Frog, a beloved crypto culture icon—gives it an instant viral appeal. Combining the explosive popularity of memes with the real power of artificial intelligence, Agent A.I. is a serious contender for the top 10 meme coin. Here are the key features of Agent A.I. that will be introduced soon: Scanning social media and on-chain data to find hottest trending projects Retrieving insider tips to find the most lucrative offers Generating AI-powered forecasts and reports to give investors an edge Giving access to exclusive analysis and early trading signals. Beyond its analytical capabilities, Agent A.I. will feature a fully automated AI-trader that will execute trades based on advanced algorithms. This would create a passive income stream, as the system will be designed to seek out profitable opportunities. $AGNT Tokens - the key to unlocking this sophisticated trading ecosystem $AGNT is the native meme coin powering Agent A.I. Holding $AGNT will unlock access to an exclusive decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)—a private club where investors can manage their portfolios, vote on strategies, and receive insider analytics. Beyond governance and staking rewards, $AGNT holders will gain access to premium AI-trading tools exclusive reports the AI-powered launchpad for launching new tokens. $AGNT tokens are currently sold for pennies. As part of the Initial Coin Offering their price is reduced greatly. Now at the sixth stage $AGNT costs $0.006666. The project is already a quarter of the way through its 28-stage presale, with the final stage price set at $1 per token. The earlier you buy, the bigger the discount. Security-wise, Agent A.I. isn’t playing around. This project has been audited by Pessimistic, a top-tier blockchain security firm. So while many meme coins crumble under the weight of their own hype, Agent A.I. stands on a rock-solid foundation (of memes and math, but mostly memes). With AI-powered insights, automated trading, and a healthy dose of absurdity, Agent A.I. claims its spot in the top 10 meme coins. Hold $AGNT and Get Ahead of the Market with Early Signals Solana's Fast Lane: Will the Speedy Blockchain Keep Climbing? Solana is a blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Anatoly Yakovenko, a former engineer at Qualcomm and Dropbox. It was created to tackle the slow transaction speeds of older networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Solana processes over 50,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchains available. The secret to Solana's speed lies in its innovative technology. It uses a unique system called proof-of-history (PoH) alongside proof-of-stake (PoS). This combination allows for quick and secure transaction verification. Developers and users are drawn to its low fees and fast processing times. Solana hosts a variety of decentralized applications and connects with other blockchains through bridges. Since its launch, Solana's native token, SOL, has experienced remarkable growth. Between mid-2021 and late 2024, SOL's price surged by over 600%, reaching an all-time high of $263.83 in November 2024. This impressive rise reflects the growing adoption and investor interest in the platform. Solana is often seen as a strong contender to Ethereum. Its speed, scalability, and innovative features make it attractive in the current market cycle. However, it faces challenges like network outages and stiff competition from other platforms. Despite these hurdles, many believe that Solana has significant potential for future growth. Looking ahead, some analysts predict that SOL could surpass $500 in the coming years. Long-term forecasts for 2030 suggest a wide range of possibilities, from substantial gains to more conservative outcomes. While predictions vary, Solana's advancements and strong fundamentals keep it at the forefront of blockchain innovation. Ripple's Ripple Effect: XRP's Past and Potential Future Ripple, often referred to by its cryptocurrency symbol XRP, is a decentralized platform designed for fast and low-cost money transfers. Unlike traditional banking systems, Ripple allows for quick transactions across borders, making it attractive to financial institutions. Its unique consensus protocol and use of node lists enable it to handle up to 1,500 transactions per second, showcasing its scalability and efficiency. Historically, XRP has experienced significant price fluctuations. In 2013, it was worth less than a cent, but by January 2018, it reached an all-time high of $3.84. This surge demonstrated XRP's potential in the cryptocurrency market. Although its price has since seen declines, many experts believe that XRP could regain and even surpass its previous peaks in the future. One of the challenges XRP has faced is regulatory scrutiny, particularly from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Legal disputes have impacted investor confidence and, consequently, XRP's market performance. Despite these hurdles, Ripple has established partnerships with numerous banks and financial institutions worldwide. These collaborations highlight XRP's growing adoption and its role in facilitating secure and swift global transactions. The underlying technology of XRP continues to be its strength. By providing a platform that enables quick and cost-effective transfers, Ripple is positioning itself as a key player in revolutionizing the financial industry. Its focus on improving money transfer speeds and security aligns with the increasing demand for efficient global payment solutions. While predicting exact future prices is challenging, the long-term outlook for XRP remains optimistic among many analysts. Its past performance, coupled with ongoing technological advancements and industry partnerships, suggests that XRP could see significant growth. Investors and enthusiasts are keeping a close eye on Ripple's developments, anticipating that XRP may once again make substantial gains in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Cardano (ADA) in 2025: A PoS Trailblazer Set for New Heights? Cardano, launched in 2017, is a decentralized blockchain platform that uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) system called Ouroboros. Unlike energy-heavy networks like Bitcoin, Cardano aims to be energy-efficient while enhancing security and scalability. Its native token, ADA, is used for transactions and staking within the network. Built on peer-reviewed research, Cardano seeks to be a prime platform for decentralized applications (dApps). It focuses on sustainability and innovation, making it attractive to developers and users alike. The platform's dedication to continuous improvement sets it apart in the crowded crypto space. Historically, ADA reached an all-time high of $3.10 in September 2021 during a major crypto bull run. Since then, it has seen ups and downs, reflecting the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. Past trends show that ADA often experiences significant growth during bullish periods. In the current market cycle of 2025, many are watching Cardano closely. With advancements in its technology and potential favorable market conditions, ADA could be poised for substantial growth. Some experts have made optimistic predictions about its long-term value based on these factors. Looking ahead, price forecasts for ADA vary. Some analysts have suggested that it could reach new heights, citing its strong fundamentals and market position. While predictions are uncertain, Cardano's commitment to innovation may play a key role in its future success. Polkadot's Journey: Bridging Blockchains and Future Growth Polkadot is a decentralized network that lets different blockchains talk to each other. Created by Gavin Wood, one of the founders of Ethereum, Polkadot aims to improve cross-chain transactions. Its native token, DOT, helps with network security and governance. Since its launch, DOT has seen significant price movements. In 2021, it reached an all-time high of $55. Over the years, the price has fluctuated, reflecting the volatile nature of the crypto market. By 2025, DOT has shown resilience, maintaining interest among investors due to its strong fundamentals. Polkadot stands out because it connects multiple blockchains. Some doubt its necessity with Ethereum's dominance and the rise of blockchain bridges. However, Polkadot's active development community believes their technology is ahead of the competition. Looking to the future, experts have made various predictions for DOT's price. DigitalCoinPrice expects an average price of $14.24 in 2025 and sees growth continuing, reaching $36.63 by 2030. Other analysts offer different views, but many agree that Polkadot has potential for growth. In the evolving cryptocurrency landscape, Polkadot remains a key player. Its focus on interoperability and a strong community make DOT an attractive option for those looking at long-term opportunities in the market. Conclusion The bull run is here, but established coins like SOL, XRP, ADA, and DOT may offer less short-term potential. Their growth is steady, but they might not deliver the rapid gains some investors seek in the current market. Agent A.I. presents an exciting alternative. This genuine meme coin is on a mission to bring both humor and substantial returns. Inspired by the success of PEPE coin, Agent A.I. offers a community-driven presale with significant early discounts.

40588125,https://invezz.com/?p=2577768,1740057789,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Why Russian no-KYC crypto exchanges keep resurfacing despite crackdowns,https://invezz.com/news/2025/02/20/why-russian-no-kyc-crypto-exchanges-keep-resurfacing-despite-crackdowns/,"Despite international efforts to clamp down on Russia’s no-KYC (Know Your Customer) crypto exchanges, new platforms continue to emerge, replacing those shut down. A report by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis highlights that while overall inflows to these platforms have declined, new Russian-language exchanges are surfacing to facilitate crypto transactions outside of traditional financial oversight. Source: Chainanalysis With over $1.5 billion worth of transactions recorded in 2024 alone, these platforms operate without formal registration, making it difficult for regulators to pinpoint their jurisdiction. The crackdown, led by US authorities and international financial watchdogs, has led to some disruptions but has not eradicated the industry. Instead, Russian users are shifting to alternative methods, reinforcing the resilience of the no-KYC market. New exchanges emerge as regulatory gaps persist The rise of unregistered exchanges in Russia signals persistent regulatory loopholes. Chainalysis found that over 100 such platforms were operating in 2024, serving a user base that prefers anonymous transactions. These platforms work closely with sanctioned Russian banks, enabling them to bypass restrictions imposed by international financial institutions. In early February, Russia’s telecom regulator, Roskomnadzor, blocked BestChange, a major over-the-counter (OTC) aggregator used for crypto transactions. The move was part of broader efforts following a new law restricting Bitcoin mining and crypto advertising. The law specifically targets ads promoting digital assets and services that facilitate crypto transfers using Russian infrastructure. BestChange’s shutdown has done little to deter traders, who quickly migrated to alternative platforms. Unlike regulated crypto exchanges, these no-KYC platforms do not require users to verify their identity, allowing them to conduct transactions without linking them to personal data. Sanctions impact inflows but fail to stop illicit transactions US and EU sanctions have successfully reduced overall inflows to Russian no-KYC exchanges, but transactions persist. The Russian crypto market has remained active due to local demand, particularly from users evading capital controls or using digital assets for cross-border payments. According to Chainalysis, the decline in inflows suggests that enforcement measures are having an effect, yet new exchanges continue to appear, often filling the gaps left by those taken offline. Many of these platforms operate as peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, allowing users to trade directly with one another, minimising the need for centralised control. A growing concern is the role of Russian financial institutions in enabling these transactions. Several no-KYC platforms reportedly collaborate with sanctioned banks, processing crypto payments despite international restrictions. This has drawn further scrutiny from regulators, who are now focusing on identifying financial institutions that support these platforms. Data collection raises security risks for Russian miners While Russian authorities claim to be tightening controls over crypto-related activities, their efforts have raised concerns among domestic Bitcoin miners. A new government registry introduced in early 2024 requires miners to submit sensitive data, including wallet addresses, to regulatory bodies. Russian lawmaker Anton Gorelkin warned that if this data were leaked, it could be a “big gift” to geopolitical rivals. Miners fear that authorities could use the collected data for crackdowns or surveillance, deterring individuals and businesses from engaging in mining operations within Russia. The data collection effort comes at a time when Russia is expanding its focus on digital assets as an alternative financial channel. With traditional banking restrictions tightening, the Russian government is exploring ways to integrate crypto into its economic strategy while maintaining control over domestic activity.

After a strong showing during its presale, some predict it could bring returns of up to $50. This surprising candidate is catching the eye of investors seeking the next big opportunity in digital currencies. DOGEN Soars 500% After DEX Listing, What’s Next with CEX on the Way? DOGEN, the meme token built for those who never settle for less, is showing strong technical and fundamental momentum. Designed for winners, DOGEN embodies the alpha mentality, and this concept has already appealed to a large community of over 30,000 followers on X. Recent Price Action & Momentum Since its listing on Raydium DEX on February 4th, DOGEN had a strong run, hitting an all-time high of $0.0066 before cooling off and stabilizing around $0.002. Even at that level, it’s still up a massive 566% from its lowest presale price of $0.0003. The presale itself raised $5.5 million showing just how much early interest this project attracted. Technical Indicators & Breakout Potential DOGEN’s current fully diluted valuation (FDV) stands at $28 million, with a projected upside toward $40 million. This rise in value suggests a potential price target of $0.004+ in the near term. Recent price action suggests DOGEN is testing key support within a descending channel. If the price breaks above $0.0032, the current downtrend would reverse and set the stage for a strong bullish move toward $0.0056, aligning with previous resistance levels. A planned major exchange listing is expected to inject fresh liquidity and increase accessibility of $DOGEN, typically a key price catalyst for meme coins. With only 1 billion tokens circulating (10% of total supply), DOGEN’s price remains highly sensitive to increased demand, setting the stage for further volatility in favor of the bulls. DOGEN Could 3x From Here – Don’t Wait for the CEX FOMO Community buzzes about DOGEN Hitting $100M+ DOGEN's remarkable post-listing performance and strong presale momentum have captured significant community attention. The eezzy’s journal channel, boasting over 50K subscribers, has recognized DOGEN's potential to become a leading memecoin on Solana, potentially reaching a market cap exceeding 100M. DOGEN has already demonstrated its ability to rally quickly, and with increasing speculation ahead of its CEX listing, the probability of retesting its $0.005 ATH—or breaking beyond—is rising. If momentum continues, DOGEN could enter a parabolic price discovery phase, with values exceeding its current FDV ceiling. DOGEN is Still Undervalued – Buy Now Before the CEX Listing Solana Eyes Breakout as Momentum Builds for a Bullish Reversal Solana is trading between $180.20 and $202.84, showing signs of a potential recovery. The price is above the 100-day simple moving average at $182.92, which is a positive sign. RSI at 49.25 suggests the coin is not overbought or oversold, meaning a big move could be coming. If SOL breaks above the $217 resistance, it could quickly climb to $240, marking a gain of over 18%. However, failure to hold support at $172.02 could push the price lower. Despite recent drops of 14.64% in a week and 32.81% in a month, the long-term trend remains positive, up 17.83% in six months. Solana could be gearing up for a strong comeback. Conclusion Coins like SOL have less short-term potential. DOGEN stands out with strong presale performance. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN is expected to grow 700% by presale end, with potential for thousand-fold returns. Following tokens like BONK and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits for early adopters.

Garnering significant presale traction, this memecoin is anticipated to potentially yield $50 returns, drawing in investors eager for the next big digital currency sensation. DOGEN's Meteoric Rise: What Lies Ahead? Within the memecoin community, DOGEN has become synonymous with ambition and success. Following its recent launch on Raydium DEX, the token witnessed a surge, skyrocketing by 500% and capturing a robust community of 30,000+ supporters on X. This rapid ascent is just the beginning for DOGEN, which embodies the ethos of excellence. Analyzing DOGEN's Growth and Market Potential Since DOGEN's debut, it has seen impressive growth. Initially listed at a modest presale price of $0.0003, it reached $0.0066, stabilizing at $0.002—a remarkable 566% increase. This initial success was underscored by a substantial $5.5 million raised during the presale phase, illustrating the strong early investor interest. Market analysts are observing DOGEN's fully diluted valuation of $28 million, anticipating a climb to $40 million. This suggests potential growth, with price projections hitting $0.004 in the short term. A forthcoming listing on a major exchange is poised to inject new capital and enhance DOGEN's accessibility. Given the limited circulation of just 1 billion tokens, this token is highly responsive to market dynamics and demand spikes, paving the way for potential upward volatility. Explore DOGEN's Potential—A Promising Crypto Future The Community's Take on DOGEN's Potential DOGEN's community buzz is centered around its extraordinary post-launch trajectory and presale success. Platforms like eezzy’s journal , which caters to over 50K enthusiasts, speculate that DOGEN could soon be a flagship Solana memecoin, possibly surpassing a market cap of $100 million. Building anticipation for its CEX debut, DOGEN is poised to revisit or even surpass its all-time high of $0.005. As the hype builds, the potential for a rapid price escalation is on the horizon. Don't Miss Out on DOGEN's CEX Debut Solana's Path: Steady Climb or Sudden Spike? Solana currently hovers between $180.20 and $202.84, positioned for a rebound. Remaining above the 100-day simple moving average at $182.92, Solana signals potential upward mobility. If SOL breaks past $217, a leap to $240 could be imminent. Conversely, not maintaining $172.02 could see a decline. Despite recent setbacks, the coin's long-term outlook remains promising. In Closing: A Bright Future for DOGEN While traditional cryptocurrencies like SOL offer consistent yet slower gains, DOGEN stands out with its presale triumph and rapid growth potential. Aiming at ambitious returns, DOGEN provides an enticing opportunity for early adopters who see its potential to replicate the success of other memecoins.

A recent Chainalysis report has brought to light a concerning trend: sanctioned entities and jurisdictions have received a staggering $15.8 billion in crypto transactions in 2024. This revelation highlights the complex intersection of digital assets and global sanctions, raising critical questions about compliance and the future of cryptocurrency regulation. Let’s dive deep into this eye-opening report and understand its implications for the crypto landscape. Why are Sanctioned Entities Turning to Crypto Transactions? Sanctions, imposed by bodies like the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), are designed to restrict access to the traditional financial system for nations, entities, or individuals deemed to be engaging in activities against international norms or U.S. interests. However, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency offers a potential loophole. Here’s why sanctioned entities are increasingly drawn to crypto transactions : Bypassing Financial Restrictions: Traditional financial institutions are heavily regulated and must comply with international sanctions. Cryptocurrency, operating outside these traditional frameworks, offers a way to circumvent these restrictions. Preserving Wealth: In regions facing economic instability or sanctions, local currencies can be volatile. Cryptocurrency, particularly stablecoins, can act as a store of value, helping individuals and entities preserve their wealth outside of traditional banking systems. Facilitating Cross-Border Transactions: Sanctions often disrupt international trade and financial flows. Cryptocurrency can enable cross-border transactions without the need for traditional intermediaries like banks, making it easier to conduct international business, even under sanctions. Anonymity and Privacy: While not entirely anonymous, cryptocurrency transactions can offer a degree of pseudonymity, making it harder to trace the origin and destination of funds compared to traditional banking. Key Findings from the Chainalysis Report on Illicit Crypto Activity The Chainalysis report paints a detailed picture of how sanctioned entities are utilizing cryptocurrency. Let’s break down the key takeaways regarding illicit crypto activity : Significant Volume: $15.8 billion in cryptocurrency was received by sanctioned entities in the past year, representing a substantial portion of the overall illicit crypto transaction volume. Dominance of Sanctioned Entities: Transactions involving sanctioned entities accounted for a massive 39% of all illicit cryptocurrency activity. This indicates a strong correlation between sanctions and the usage of crypto for illicit purposes. Regional Hotspots: Countries under heavy sanctions, like Iran, are seeing increased cryptocurrency adoption. Centralized exchanges (CEXs) in these regions are experiencing a surge in activity as residents seek refuge from financial restrictions and currency devaluation. Russia’s Evasion Tactics: Despite sanctions targeting Russia’s military funding, entities like KB Vostok OOO, a Russian UAV manufacturer, are allegedly using local crypto exchanges and platforms like Garantex to bypass these restrictions. Garantex alone processed over $100 million in transactions, highlighting the scale of potential circumvention. Mixing Services on the Rise: Crypto mixing services, like Tornado Cash, have witnessed a 108% increase in inflows. These services, often used to obfuscate the origin of funds, are being leveraged by groups like Lazarus to launder hacked cryptocurrency. Compliance Efforts Showing Impact: On a positive note, the report indicates that compliance efforts are having some effect. Offshore exchanges are showing reduced interaction with Iranian services, suggesting that regulatory pressure and compliance measures are starting to make a difference. Examples of Sanctioned Entities and Crypto Usage To further illustrate the issue, let’s look at some specific examples from the Chainalysis report : Entity/Region Activity Key Crypto Platforms Impact Iran Wealth preservation, bypassing financial restrictions Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) Surge in crypto transactions on local CEXs KB Vostok OOO (Russia) Military funding circumvention Local crypto exchanges, Garantex Allegedly bypassed sanctions using crypto Lazarus Group (North Korea) Money laundering of hacked funds Tornado Cash (crypto mixer) Utilized mixers to obfuscate illicit funds Challenges in Combating Illicit Crypto Transactions by Sanctioned Entities Addressing the use of cryptocurrency by sanctioned entities presents a unique set of challenges: Decentralization: The very nature of cryptocurrency, being decentralized and borderless, makes it difficult for traditional regulatory bodies to control and monitor transactions. Pseudonymity: While blockchain transactions are transparent, the pseudonymous nature of wallet addresses can make it challenging to identify the real-world entities behind them. Global Nature: Cryptocurrency operates globally, meaning that sanctioned entities can potentially use exchanges and services in jurisdictions with weaker regulatory frameworks. Technological Sophistication: Illicit actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their use of technology, employing mixers, privacy coins, and other tools to evade detection. Enforcement Complexity: Enforcing sanctions in the crypto space requires international cooperation and coordination, which can be complex and time-consuming. Actionable Insights and the Path Forward for Cryptocurrency Sanctions Compliance Despite the challenges, there are actionable steps that can be taken to improve compliance and mitigate the risks associated with cryptocurrency sanctions : Enhanced Regulatory Frameworks: Governments and regulatory bodies need to develop clearer and more comprehensive regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrency, specifically addressing sanctions compliance. Improved KYC/AML Procedures: Cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers must implement robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures to identify and prevent transactions involving sanctioned entities. Blockchain Analytics and Monitoring: Leveraging blockchain analytics tools, like those provided by Chainalysis, is crucial for monitoring transactions and identifying suspicious activity linked to sanctioned entities. International Collaboration: Increased international cooperation and information sharing are essential to effectively track and disrupt illicit crypto flows across borders. Public-Private Partnerships: Collaboration between government agencies, blockchain analytics firms, and cryptocurrency businesses can lead to more effective strategies for sanctions compliance. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for the Crypto Industry The Chainalysis report serves as a stark reminder of the challenges and responsibilities facing the cryptocurrency industry. While crypto offers numerous benefits, its potential for misuse by sanctioned entities and illicit actors cannot be ignored. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, proactive measures, robust compliance frameworks, and international collaboration are paramount to ensure that this innovative technology is not exploited to undermine global security and financial integrity. The $15.8 billion figure is not just a number; it’s a wake-up call for the entire crypto ecosystem to double down on efforts to combat illicit activity and ensure responsible innovation.

Strait Times, a Singaporean news outlet reports , Ho Kai Xin, a 32-year-old former outsourced payroll manager at Bybit Fintech, has been sentenced to nearly ten years in prison for stealing 5.7 million SGD ($4.2 million) in crypto. Her scheme, which spanned over a year, involved falsifying payroll records to divert funds into her own accounts. The case has highlighted significant vulnerabilities in internal security measures at crypto firms, particularly those relying on third-party contractors for payroll processing. With increasing scrutiny on digital asset companies, Bybit’s failure to detect the fraudulent transactions for months underscores the broader challenges of financial security in the sector. The sentencing also signals a growing crackdown by Singaporean authorities on financial crimes involving cryptocurrencies. Crypto payroll loophole Ho’s fraudulent activities began in May 2022, when she manipulated Microsoft Excel spreadsheets to divert payroll payments from Wechain, Bybit’s payroll processing firm, to her own accounts. She altered transaction details, ensuring that the stolen funds—initially 117,000 SGD ($87,417)—were sent directly to her bank instead of employee wallets. Encouraged by the success of her initial theft, she escalated her activities, eventually siphoning off millions in USDT. Court documents reveal that between May and August 2022, Ho directed eight major crypto transfers from Bybit to her digital wallets. She then converted the stolen Tether (USDT) into fiat currency, using six bank accounts and four electronic wallets across multiple crypto platforms to obscure the money trail. This level of sophistication in laundering stolen crypto funds highlights the regulatory gaps in monitoring insider transactions within the sector. The fraud went undetected for months until a Wechain finance director flagged unusual transactions in September 2022. Following an internal investigation, the company reported the fraud to the police in February 2023, leading to Ho’s arrest in April. Lavish spending spree exposes stolen crypto funds Rather than concealing her wealth, Ho openly indulged in luxury purchases that raised suspicions. She placed a 750,000 SGD ($560,388) down payment on a penthouse worth over 3.7 million SGD ($2.7 million), despite her modest salary. She also spent nearly 840,000 SGD ($627,633) on luxury goods, including sunglasses, bags, shoes, and jewellery from Louis Vuitton. Her reckless spending continued even after authorities froze her assets. In January 2024, Ho was sentenced to six weeks in jail for violating court orders after she continued to use stolen funds. She had been explicitly instructed not to touch the money but proceeded to spend large sums anyway. This defiance further strengthened the prosecution’s case against her. Singapore’s crackdown on crypto fraud intensifies Ho’s sentencing marks one of Singapore’s toughest rulings against crypto-related financial crime. The country has positioned itself as a regulated hub for digital assets, implementing strict licensing rules for exchanges and payment providers. This case has exposed potential weaknesses in how payroll transactions are monitored, particularly when outsourced to third-party firms. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has been ramping up regulatory oversight, particularly on anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. In the wake of Ho’s case, industry experts anticipate tighter controls on crypto firms’ payroll processes and financial reporting. Companies handling large amounts of digital assets may face stricter requirements to track transactions and conduct regular internal audits. Ho’s nearly ten-year prison sentence underscores Singapore’s firm stance against financial misconduct in the digital asset industry. As crypto adoption continues to grow, firms will need to enhance internal controls to prevent similar breaches. Meanwhile, regulators are expected to impose more stringent policies to mitigate insider fraud risks within the industry.

Montana is on the cusp of a potentially groundbreaking move in the world of cryptocurrency. The U.S. state is advancing legislation that could see it establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Imagine a state government holding Bitcoin – it’s a concept that’s gaining traction, and Montana is leading the charge. Let’s dive into what this means, why it’s significant, and what could happen next. What’s Happening in Montana with Bitcoin? As reported by the Satoshi Action Fund, a non-profit dedicated to Bitcoin advocacy, Montana’s Bitcoin reserve legislation has successfully navigated the committee stage and is now headed for a crucial House floor vote. This is a major step forward for a bill that could position Montana as a pioneer in state-level Bitcoin adoption. The implications of this legislation are far-reaching, potentially setting a precedent for other states and even national governments to consider integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategies. But what exactly does ‘strategic Bitcoin reserve legislation’ entail? It suggests that Montana is exploring the possibility of holding Bitcoin as part of its state treasury reserves, similar to how states hold gold or foreign currencies. This isn’t just about acknowledging Bitcoin; it’s about potentially incorporating it into the state’s financial framework. Why is Montana Considering Bitcoin Adoption? The question on everyone’s mind is: why Montana? Several factors could be driving this initiative towards Bitcoin adoption : Diversification: States traditionally hold reserves in assets like government bonds. Bitcoin, being a decentralized and uncorrelated asset, could offer diversification benefits, potentially reducing risk and enhancing returns over the long term. Future-Proofing Finances: With growing concerns about inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies, some see Bitcoin as a hedge against these economic uncertainties. Holding Bitcoin could be viewed as a forward-thinking approach to safeguarding state funds. Technological Innovation Hub: Montana might be aiming to position itself as a forward-thinking, tech-friendly state. Embracing Bitcoin could attract innovation, businesses, and talent in the burgeoning cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors. Economic Opportunities: Bitcoin mining and related industries are growing. By embracing Bitcoin, Montana could tap into new economic opportunities, potentially generating revenue and jobs within the state. It’s a bold move, and it speaks volumes about the evolving perception of Bitcoin as more than just a speculative asset. It’s being considered as a legitimate component of a diversified financial strategy. The Potential Benefits of a State Bitcoin Reserve Let’s explore the potential upsides if Montana successfully establishes a state Bitcoin reserve : Benefit Description Enhanced Financial Security Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and limited supply could offer a layer of protection against inflation and economic instability, potentially securing the state’s financial future. Increased Revenue Streams If Bitcoin appreciates in value, the state’s reserves could grow, generating additional revenue that could be used for public services or tax relief. Attracting Investment and Innovation A pro-Bitcoin stance could attract cryptocurrency businesses, investors, and tech talent to Montana, boosting the state’s economy. Global Recognition and Leadership Montana could become a recognized leader in digital asset adoption, setting an example for other states and countries to follow. Reduced Reliance on Traditional Financial Systems Bitcoin offers an alternative to traditional banking and financial systems, potentially reducing reliance on centralized institutions. These potential benefits are significant and underscore why Montana’s initiative is generating so much interest. Navigating the Challenges of Cryptocurrency Regulation Of course, venturing into uncharted territory like cryptocurrency regulation and state Bitcoin reserves comes with its set of challenges and considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility is a well-known factor. Managing a Bitcoin reserve would require careful risk management strategies to mitigate potential losses due to price fluctuations. Custody and Security: Securely storing and managing a state’s Bitcoin reserves is crucial. Robust security measures and custody solutions would need to be implemented to prevent theft or loss. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Montana would need to navigate potential changes in federal and state regulations. Public Perception and Education: Educating the public and addressing concerns about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is essential for gaining broader support and understanding of this initiative. Operational Complexity: Managing a Bitcoin reserve involves technical expertise and operational infrastructure that the state might need to develop or acquire. These challenges are not insurmountable, but they require careful planning, expertise, and a proactive approach to risk management and cryptocurrency regulation . What’s Next for Montana’s Bitcoin Legislation? The immediate next step is the House floor vote. If the legislation passes the House, it will likely move to the Senate for consideration and then, if successful there, to the Governor for signature. The journey of Montana Bitcoin legislation is far from over, but reaching the House floor vote is a significant milestone. The timeline for the vote and subsequent stages is still unfolding. Keep an eye on legislative updates and news from Montana to track the progress of this landmark bill. The Broader Implications of Bitcoin Reserve Legislation Montana’s initiative is more than just state-level news; it has broader implications for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem and potentially for other states and nations. If Montana succeeds in establishing a Bitcoin reserve, it could: Legitimize Bitcoin Further: State-level adoption could further legitimize Bitcoin as a viable asset class and store of value in the eyes of institutions and the public. Inspire Other States: Montana’s example could inspire other U.S. states to explore similar Bitcoin initiatives, leading to a wave of state-level cryptocurrency adoption. Global Impact: The move could resonate globally, influencing other countries to consider Bitcoin as part of their national reserves or financial strategies. Accelerate Bitcoin Adoption: Increased institutional and governmental interest could accelerate the overall adoption and mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin. This is a developing story, and the outcome of Montana’s legislative efforts will be closely watched by the cryptocurrency community and beyond. It represents a potentially **bold** and transformative step towards integrating Bitcoin into the traditional financial landscape. Conclusion: Montana’s Pioneering Bitcoin Move Montana’s progress with Bitcoin reserve legislation is a landmark development. It signifies a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s potential beyond a speculative asset and its possible role in state finances. While challenges exist, the potential benefits of diversification, financial security, and economic innovation are compelling. As Montana moves closer to a House floor vote, the world watches with anticipation, recognizing the potential for this legislation to be a catalyst for broader Bitcoin adoption and a paradigm shift in how states manage their financial reserves. This is a story of innovation, forward-thinking policy, and the evolving relationship between governments and cryptocurrency.

The digital asset landscape is rapidly evolving, and smart money is always looking for the next big opportunity. Enter Canary Capital, with their groundbreaking launch of the Canary AXL Trust. This isn’t just another crypto investment vehicle; it’s a strategically designed trust aimed at providing institutional investors with seamless access to the Axelar Network’s native token, AXL. Let’s dive into why this launch is making waves and what it means for the future of crypto investment. Why Are Institutional Investors Eyeing Crypto Trusts Like AXL? For years, institutional investors have been cautiously observing the cryptocurrency market. Volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and the complexities of direct digital asset management have been significant hurdles. However, the narrative is changing. Crypto Trusts are emerging as a sophisticated solution, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized world. Here’s why they are gaining traction: Simplified Access: Trusts streamline the investment process, eliminating the need for institutions to directly handle digital wallets, private keys, and exchange complexities. Regulatory Compliance: Structured as traditional investment vehicles, trusts often offer a more familiar and compliant framework, easing regulatory concerns for institutions. Custodial Solutions: Reputable custodians like Coinbase, in the case of the AXL Trust, provide secure storage and management of the underlying assets, a critical requirement for institutional-grade security.

The digital currency world is buzzing with news from Nigeria, where the government is demanding a jaw-dropping $81 billion penalty from Binance. Yes, you read that right – $81 billion ! This massive fine is for alleged tax violations and operating without proper registration, escalating the legal troubles for one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges. Let’s dive into the details of this developing saga and understand what it means for Binance and the broader crypto landscape, especially concerning crypto regulation . What’s Behind the Staggering Binance Nigeria Penalty? The Nigerian government is coming down hard on Binance, accusing the exchange of serious financial misconduct. The core of the issue revolves around allegations of crypto tax violations and illegal foreign exchange trading. Here’s a breakdown of the charges: Unregistered Operations: Nigerian authorities claim Binance operated within the country without the necessary registration, essentially bypassing local regulations designed to oversee financial institutions. Economic Losses: A significant portion of the penalty, a staggering $79.5 billion, is attributed to alleged economic losses suffered by Nigeria due to Binance’s operations. The specifics of how these losses were calculated are still emerging, but it points to accusations of undermining the Nigerian economy through illicit financial flows. Tax Evasion: Adding to the financial strain, Binance faces a $2 billion tax fine, directly linked to the alleged crypto tax violations . This charge suggests a failure to comply with Nigerian tax laws applicable to businesses operating within the country. Illegal Forex Trading: The charges also include engaging in illegal foreign exchange trading. This is a particularly sensitive issue in Nigeria, where the government closely manages foreign exchange to stabilize its currency. According to reports from DL News, this isn’t Binance’s first brush with Nigerian law. The exchange is already facing two other cases in the country, including serious allegations of money laundering and tax evasion. This latest development significantly amplifies the Binance legal trouble in Nigeria, raising questions about the exchange’s operational practices in the region. [img src=”image-url-binance-nigeria.jpg” alt=”Binance Nigeria Legal Issues”] Binance’s Defense: Denying All Allegations Binance, for its part, is vehemently denying all the accusations. The exchange maintains it operates within the legal frameworks of all jurisdictions where it has a presence. Their official statements emphasize a commitment to compliance and cooperation with regulatory bodies globally. However, the specifics of their defense strategy in the Nigerian case are yet to be fully disclosed. The upcoming trial, set to begin on Monday, will be a crucial platform for Binance to present its side of the story and challenge the hefty Binance Nigeria penalty . Why is Nigeria Taking Such a Hard Line on Crypto Exchanges? Nigeria’s aggressive stance against Binance reflects a broader global trend of increased regulatory scrutiny towards cryptocurrency exchanges. Several factors might be contributing to Nigeria’s tough approach: Economic Stability: Like many developing nations, Nigeria is concerned about the potential impact of unregulated cryptocurrency flows on its economic stability. Concerns about capital flight and currency destabilization are paramount. Combating Financial Crime: Cryptocurrencies, while offering innovation, are also perceived as potential tools for money laundering, terrorism financing, and other illicit activities. Governments worldwide are keen to prevent their financial systems from being exploited for criminal purposes. Protecting Investors: The volatile nature of the crypto market and the lack of robust consumer protection mechanisms are causing regulatory unease. Nigeria, like other nations, may be seeking to protect its citizens from potential financial risks associated with unregulated crypto exchange fines and operations. Revenue Generation: Taxation is a key driver for governments globally. Ensuring that cryptocurrency businesses pay their fair share of taxes is becoming a priority, and Nigeria’s pursuit of crypto tax violations against Binance could be seen in this light. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto in Nigeria? Nigeria has one of the highest rates of cryptocurrency adoption in Africa. The ongoing legal battle between Nigeria and Binance could have significant implications for the future of crypto in the country. Here’s what to consider: Increased Regulation: This case will likely accelerate the push for clearer and stricter Nigeria crypto regulation . The government may introduce new licensing requirements, compliance standards, and oversight mechanisms for cryptocurrency exchanges operating within its borders. Impact on Crypto Adoption: While stringent regulations might initially dampen enthusiasm, they could also foster a more stable and trustworthy crypto environment in the long run. Clear rules can attract legitimate businesses and investors, ultimately promoting sustainable growth. Precedent Setting: The outcome of the Binance case could set a precedent for how other African nations approach the regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges. It will be closely watched by governments and crypto businesses across the continent. Investor Confidence: The legal uncertainty surrounding crypto in Nigeria could impact investor confidence in the short term. However, a well-defined regulatory framework could eventually boost confidence by providing clarity and reducing risks. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Evolving Crypto Regulatory Landscape For crypto users and businesses operating in or considering entering the Nigerian market, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on regulatory developments in Nigeria and other jurisdictions. Regulations are evolving rapidly, and staying updated is crucial for compliance and informed decision-making. Prioritize Compliance: For crypto businesses, robust compliance programs are no longer optional – they are essential. Engage with legal experts to ensure adherence to local regulations and international standards. Advocate for Clear Regulation: Engage in constructive dialogue with regulators and policymakers. Advocating for clear, balanced, and innovation-friendly regulations can help shape a positive future for the crypto industry. Risk Assessment: Understand the regulatory risks associated with operating in different jurisdictions. Conduct thorough risk assessments and develop mitigation strategies. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Crypto Regulation The $81 billion penalty sought by Nigeria against Binance is a dramatic escalation in the ongoing global conversation about crypto regulation . This case underscores the growing pressure on cryptocurrency exchanges to comply with national laws and the increasing assertiveness of governments in overseeing the digital asset space. As the trial unfolds, the crypto world will be watching closely, as the outcome could have far-reaching implications for the industry’s future trajectory in Nigeria and beyond. The sheer size of the Binance Nigeria penalty sends a clear message: governments are serious about regulating crypto, and non-compliance comes at a steep price.

The newly acquired licenses in the two U.S. states will enable the web3 payment infrastructure provider to operate independently in Illinois and Missouri, crypto.news can exclusively confirm. A Money Transmitter License grants firms operating in the United States the ability to engage in money transmission activities in compliance with financial laws and consumer protection regulations. For Transak, obtaining these licenses allows the firm to directly facilitate fiat-to-crypto transactions for residents and businesses in Illinois and Missouri. Since Transak will no longer operate under external provider licenses in these states, it can now offer faster fiat-to-crypto transactions without intermediary delays. Additionally, the firm can provide tailored payment solutions for local businesses that were previously restricted by third-party compliance requirements. The MTL also strengthens consumer protection by ensuring that Transak’s operations are monitored under state-specific financial regulations.

A major showdown is brewing in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and US regulations. The Blockchain Association, a powerful voice in the crypto industry, is stepping up to challenge a controversial new rule from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This isn’t just another regulatory tweak; it’s a battle that could significantly reshape how DeFi operates in the United States. Let’s dive into what’s happening and why it matters to every crypto user. Why is the Blockchain Association Declaring War on the IRS DeFi Rule? The Blockchain Association isn’t just any group; it’s a formidable force representing over 75 leading crypto companies, including industry giants like Coinbase, Kraken, and Uniswap Labs. When they speak, the crypto world listens. And right now, they are speaking out LOUDLY against a new IRS rule concerning DeFi broker revenue reporting. According to a recent report by The Block, the Blockchain Association is actively urging Congressional leaders to take action. Their mission? To repeal what they see as a fundamentally flawed and overreaching IRS rule. Senator Ted Cruz has already introduced a bill aimed at doing just that, signaling that this issue is gaining serious traction in Washington. But what exactly is so problematic about this rule? Flawed from the Start: The Blockchain Association argues that the rule is based on a misunderstanding of how DeFi actually works. They believe it’s technically impractical and conceptually misguided. Regulatory Overreach: They see this as a classic example of government overreach, finalized in the waning days of the Biden administration without proper consideration for the nuances of DeFi. Chilling Innovation: Industry experts fear that such regulations, if poorly designed, can stifle innovation and push DeFi activities overseas, hurting the US’s position in the global crypto landscape. Decoding the Controversial IRS DeFi Rule: What’s the Fuss About? At the heart of this conflict is the IRS ‘s finalized rule that mandates IRS DeFi rule for brokers involved in digital asset sales. This rule, slated to take effect after January 1, 2027, requires these brokers to report gross revenue from digital asset transactions. Sounds straightforward, right? Not so fast. The problem lies in the definition of a ‘broker’ and how it applies to the decentralized nature of DeFi. In traditional finance, brokers are intermediaries who facilitate transactions. But DeFi is built on the principle of removing intermediaries. So, who exactly is a ‘broker’ in the context of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), automated market makers (AMMs), and other DeFi protocols? This ambiguity is precisely what’s causing concern. The Blockchain Association and many in the crypto community fear that the IRS’s broad definition could inadvertently capture: Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): Platforms like Uniswap or SushiSwap, which are governed by code and community, not centralized entities. Protocol Developers: Individuals or teams who create and maintain DeFi protocols, potentially holding them responsible for user tax reporting. Even Individual Users: In some interpretations, users interacting directly with DeFi protocols could be seen as ‘brokers’ in certain scenarios, creating an impossible compliance burden. The implications are vast and potentially crippling for the burgeoning DeFi sector. Imagine if every DEX had to collect and report detailed transaction data on all its users to the IRS. The technical and logistical nightmare is compounded by the privacy concerns inherent in DeFi. Why is DeFi Regulation So Critical and Complex? DeFi regulation is not just about taxes; it’s about striking a delicate balance between fostering innovation and protecting consumers and the integrity of the financial system. The challenge is that DeFi operates in a fundamentally different way from traditional finance. Here’s why regulating it is so complex: Aspect Traditional Finance Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Intermediaries Centralized brokers, banks, exchanges Decentralized protocols, smart contracts, AMMs Control Centralized control by institutions Decentralized governance, community-driven Transparency Opaque systems, limited transparency Transparent blockchains, open-source code Regulation Established regulatory frameworks Evolving regulatory landscape, jurisdictional challenges Traditional regulatory frameworks are often ill-equipped to handle the decentralized, borderless, and code-driven nature of DeFi. Applying old rules to new paradigms can lead to unintended consequences, like the Blockchain Association argues is happening with this IRS rule. A key concern is that overly broad or poorly designed regulations can: Stifle Innovation: Crushing the entrepreneurial spirit and slowing down the development of groundbreaking financial technologies. Drive Activity Offshore: Pushing DeFi innovation and economic activity to jurisdictions with more favorable regulatory environments, weakening the US’s competitive edge. Hurt Retail Users: Increasing compliance costs and complexities, potentially making DeFi less accessible and more expensive for everyday users. The Potential Impact on Crypto Tax Reporting and Users The implications of the crypto tax reporting rule are far-reaching. If the IRS rule stands as it is, it could create a compliance nightmare for the DeFi industry and its users. Imagine the complexity of a user engaging with multiple DeFi protocols across different chains. Tracking every transaction, calculating taxable events, and reporting them accurately could become an overwhelming burden. Here’s a glimpse of the potential ripple effects: Increased Compliance Costs: DeFi platforms may need to invest heavily in developing complex reporting systems to comply with the IRS rule, potentially passing these costs on to users. Data Privacy Concerns: Forcing DeFi protocols to collect and report user data could clash with the privacy-centric ethos of many crypto users and potentially expose sensitive information. Reduced DeFi Adoption: The added complexity and compliance burden could deter new users from entering the DeFi space, slowing down its growth and mainstream adoption. Innovation Slowdown: Resources and energy diverted to compliance could mean less investment in developing new and innovative DeFi products and services. For individual users, this could translate to more complicated tax filings, potential penalties for non-compliance (even if unintentional), and a less user-friendly DeFi experience overall. It’s crucial that any regulatory framework for DeFi is practical, proportionate, and takes into account the unique characteristics of this technology. What’s Next? The Fight for Digital Asset Tax Clarity The fight over this IRS rule is far from over. With Senator Ted Cruz introducing a bill to repeal it and the Blockchain Association actively lobbying Congress, the debate is heating up. This is a pivotal moment for the future of digital asset tax policy in the US. Here’s what to watch out for: Congressional Action: Keep an eye on whether Senator Cruz’s bill gains traction and support in Congress. The outcome of this legislative effort will be crucial. IRS Response: Will the IRS reconsider its approach in light of industry concerns? There’s a possibility they might issue further guidance or amend the rule. Industry Advocacy: The Blockchain Association and other crypto advocacy groups will continue to push for a more sensible and practical regulatory framework for DeFi. Global Developments: How other countries are regulating DeFi will also play a role, potentially influencing the US approach. The crypto community needs to stay informed and engaged in this process. The future of DeFi innovation and adoption in the US hinges on finding a regulatory balance that fosters growth while addressing legitimate concerns. This IRS rule, in its current form, appears to be a step in the wrong direction, and the Blockchain Association is right to challenge it. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for DeFi’s Future The Blockchain Association’s urgent call to repeal the IRS’s DeFi broker revenue reporting rule highlights a critical juncture for the future of decentralized finance. This isn’t just a technical tax issue; it’s a fundamental question of how innovation will be regulated in the digital age. A poorly conceived rule could stifle the immense potential of DeFi, pushing development and economic activity overseas and hindering the US’s leadership in this transformative technology. The fight for sensible DeFi regulation is essential. It requires collaboration between regulators, industry experts, and policymakers to create frameworks that are both effective and innovation-friendly. The outcome of this battle will not only shape the future of DeFi but also set a precedent for how emerging technologies are regulated in the years to come.

Nasdaq, a leading global exchange, is pushing the boundaries of digital asset accessibility. They’ve just proposed a rule change that could pave the way for a new era of investment opportunities in the crypto space. If you’ve been waiting for more regulated and mainstream avenues to engage with digital assets, this could be a game-changer. Let’s dive into the details of this potentially transformative development. What’s the Buzz Around Digital Asset Investments on Nasdaq? Nasdaq has formally submitted a proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to introduce Rule 5712. This isn’t just another procedural step; it’s a significant move aimed at creating a clear regulatory framework for listing and trading investment products based on digital asset investments . Think of it as Nasdaq laying down the welcome mat for a wider range of crypto-related investment vehicles. Here’s a breakdown of what this proposal entails: New Rule 5712: This rule is specifically designed to govern the listing of ‘digital asset-based investment interests.’ This broad category includes securities backed by digital assets and commodity-based products that have a crypto foundation. Expanding Investment Options: The rule is intended to open doors for investors to access digital assets through familiar investment structures, potentially reducing some of the perceived barriers to entry in the crypto market. Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index U.S. ETF in Focus: The proposal explicitly mentions moving the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index U.S. ETF under this new rule. This ETF is already invested in leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, signaling Nasdaq’s readiness to embrace established digital assets. Future-Proofing for Crypto Evolution: The ETF’s structure is designed to be adaptable. As U.S. SEC crypto regulations evolve and mature, the ETF has the flexibility to potentially include a broader spectrum of digital assets. This forward-thinking approach is crucial in the rapidly changing crypto landscape. Why is a Dedicated Crypto ETF Rule a Big Deal? The introduction of Rule 5712 isn’t just a minor adjustment; it represents a significant step forward for the integration of crypto ETFs into mainstream finance. Here’s why this proposal is garnering attention: Increased Legitimacy and Investor Confidence: Having a dedicated rule within a major exchange like Nasdaq lends significant legitimacy to the digital asset space. This can boost investor confidence, particularly for institutional investors who often require a clear regulatory framework. Simplified Access to Crypto Markets: For many investors, directly buying and managing cryptocurrencies can seem complex and risky. Crypto ETFs offered through established exchanges like Nasdaq simplify this process. Investors can gain exposure to digital assets through brokerage accounts they already use for stocks and traditional ETFs. Potential for Broader Market Participation: By making it easier and more regulated to invest in digital assets, Nasdaq’s proposal could attract a wider range of investors. This influx of capital could further mature the crypto market and reduce volatility over time. Clarity in Regulatory Landscape: The proposal signals a proactive approach from a major exchange in navigating the evolving SEC crypto regulations . This clarity is crucial for businesses looking to build and offer digital asset investment products within a compliant framework. Navigating the Challenges and Looking Ahead for Nasdaq Crypto ETFs While the proposal is undoubtedly exciting, it’s important to acknowledge the potential challenges and the road ahead for Nasdaq crypto initiatives and the broader crypto ETF market. Potential Challenges: Challenge Description SEC Approval Process: The SEC’s approval of Rule 5712 is not guaranteed. The SEC has been cautious about crypto-related investment products in the past, and the review process could be lengthy and involve requests for modifications. Regulatory Uncertainty: The broader regulatory landscape for digital assets in the U.S. is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the types of digital assets that can be included in ETFs and the operational requirements for these products. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. While ETFs can offer diversification, they are still subject to the inherent price swings of the underlying digital assets, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

40587369,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=131465,1740059019,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Truth Revealed: Vitalik Buterin Declares Ethereum a Decentralized Ecosystem, Not a Company",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-decentralized-ecosystem-truth/,"In a candid statement that has resonated throughout the crypto sphere, Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has firmly reiterated a core tenet of the project’s philosophy: Ethereum is a decentralized ecosystem , emphatically not a company. This declaration, made on WarpCast, arrives at a crucial juncture for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, as it navigates an evolving landscape of regulations, technological advancements, and ever-increasing user expectations. But what does this distinction truly mean for Ethereum, its users, and the future of blockchain technology? Let’s dive deep into Buterin’s insightful perspective and unpack the implications. Why Ethereum’s Decentralized Ecosystem Matters More Than Ever Buterin’s assertion isn’t just semantics; it’s a fundamental principle that underpins the very essence of Ethereum. He highlights the presence of numerous significant entities within the Ethereum space – giants like ConsenSys and Coinbase – yet stresses that these are participants in a broader, decentralized network, not components of a centralized corporate structure. The core message is clear: Ethereum’s strength lies in its distributed nature, fostering innovation and resilience far beyond the capabilities of a traditional company. Consider these key aspects: Resilience Against Central Points of Failure: Unlike companies that can be shut down or controlled by a single authority, a decentralized ecosystem like Ethereum distributes power across numerous nodes and participants. This inherent distribution makes it incredibly resistant to censorship, shutdowns, and single points of failure. Open Innovation and Collaboration: The decentralized nature of Ethereum encourages open-source development and collaborative innovation. Anyone can build upon and contribute to the ecosystem, leading to a diverse range of applications and solutions that wouldn’t be possible within a closed corporate environment. Community-Driven Governance: While the Ethereum Foundation plays a coordinating role, the overall direction of Ethereum is influenced by a vast and diverse community. This community-driven governance model ensures that the platform evolves in a way that benefits its users and aligns with the principles of decentralization. Global Accessibility and Inclusivity: Ethereum’s decentralized nature makes it accessible to anyone, anywhere in the world, without needing permission from a central authority. This inclusivity fosters a global community of developers, users, and innovators, driving growth and adoption. Vitalik Buterin’s Vision: Applications Over Infrastructure Buterin further elaborated on the current phase of Ethereum’s development, stating, “now is the era of applications, not infrastructure.” This statement marks a significant shift in focus. In its early years, much of Ethereum’s energy was directed towards building the foundational infrastructure – the blockchain itself, smart contract capabilities, and network security. Now, with a robust infrastructure in place, the emphasis is rightly shifting towards leveraging this foundation to create impactful and user-friendly applications. This transition is crucial for several reasons: Real-World Utility: Focusing on applications means translating the potential of blockchain technology into tangible solutions that address real-world problems. This could range from decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to supply chain management solutions, identity verification systems, and beyond. User Adoption and Engagement: Applications are the interface through which most users will interact with blockchain technology. By prioritizing user-friendly and valuable applications, Ethereum can attract a wider audience and drive mainstream adoption of decentralized technologies. Ecosystem Growth and Sustainability: A thriving application ecosystem creates a positive feedback loop. Successful applications attract more users, developers, and investment, further fueling the growth and sustainability of the entire Ethereum network. Demonstrating the Power of Decentralization: Compelling applications showcase the practical benefits of a decentralized ecosystem . They provide concrete examples of how decentralization can lead to greater transparency, security, efficiency, and user empowerment compared to traditional centralized systems. The Call for New Ecosystem Inflow: Expanding the Ethereum Universe Buterin’s comments also included a call for “more opportunities to be provided to create new ecosystem inflow.” This is a forward-looking statement that acknowledges the need for continuous growth and evolution within the Ethereum ecosystem. Ecosystem inflow refers to the influx of new users, developers, projects, and capital into the network. Sustained inflow is vital for maintaining the dynamism and competitiveness of Ethereum. How can we foster this inflow and ensure the continued vibrancy of the Ethereum decentralized ecosystem ? Improving User Experience (UX): One of the biggest barriers to entry for new users is the complexity often associated with blockchain technology. Simplifying user interfaces, streamlining onboarding processes, and providing better educational resources are crucial steps to attract a broader audience. Developer Tooling and Support: Attracting and retaining developers is essential for building a thriving application ecosystem. Investing in robust developer tooling, providing comprehensive documentation, and offering strong community support can make Ethereum a more attractive platform for developers. Interoperability and Cross-Chain Collaboration: The future of blockchain is likely to be multi-chain. Enhancing interoperability between Ethereum and other blockchains can unlock new opportunities for collaboration and innovation, expanding the reach and utility of the Ethereum ecosystem. Focus on Emerging Markets: Emerging markets represent a significant growth opportunity for the crypto space. Tailoring solutions and outreach efforts to the specific needs and contexts of these markets can unlock new user bases and drive global adoption of Ethereum. Challenges and Considerations for a Decentralized Future While the vision of a decentralized ecosystem is compelling, it’s essential to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that come with it. Decentralization is not a panacea, and it presents its own set of complexities: Challenge Description Consideration Governance Complexity Decentralized governance can be slower and more complex than centralized decision-making. Reaching consensus across a diverse community can be challenging. Developing effective and efficient decentralized governance models is an ongoing area of research and development within the Ethereum ecosystem. Scalability While Ethereum has made significant strides with upgrades like The Merge, scalability remains a key challenge for widespread adoption. Layer-2 scaling solutions and ongoing research into Layer-1 improvements are crucial for addressing scalability and ensuring Ethereum can handle increasing transaction volumes. Regulation The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Navigating this complex and often uncertain environment is a challenge for the entire crypto industry, including Ethereum. Proactive engagement with regulators and a commitment to compliance are essential for fostering a sustainable and regulated crypto ecosystem. Security While blockchain technology itself is inherently secure, vulnerabilities can still exist in smart contracts and applications built on top of it. Rigorous security audits, best practices for smart contract development, and ongoing vigilance are crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of the Ethereum ecosystem. Actionable Insights: Embracing the Decentralized Ethos For those involved in the crypto space – developers, users, investors, and enthusiasts – Buterin’s message offers valuable actionable insights: Support Decentralized Projects: Actively seek out and support projects that align with the principles of decentralization. This includes contributing to open-source initiatives, participating in decentralized governance, and using decentralized applications. Focus on User-Centric Applications: Developers should prioritize building applications that are user-friendly, solve real-world problems, and enhance the overall user experience within the Ethereum ecosystem. Educate and Advocate for Decentralization: Spread awareness about the benefits of decentralization and advocate for policies that support the growth of decentralized technologies. Education is key to driving wider adoption and understanding. Contribute to Ecosystem Growth: Actively participate in the Ethereum community, contribute to discussions, provide feedback, and support initiatives that aim to expand the ecosystem and attract new participants. Conclusion: Ethereum’s Decentralized Promise Vitalik Buterin’s reaffirmation of Ethereum as a decentralized ecosystem is more than just a statement; it’s a guiding principle that continues to shape the project’s trajectory. By emphasizing decentralization and shifting focus towards applications, Ethereum is poised to unlock its full potential and drive the next wave of innovation in the blockchain space. The challenges are real, but the promise of a more open, transparent, and user-empowered future, built on the foundation of a decentralized ecosystem, remains incredibly powerful and inspiring. As we move forward, embracing this decentralized ethos will be crucial for realizing the transformative potential of Ethereum and the broader crypto revolution.

The latest buzz in the digital currency world isn’t about Bitcoin’s next halving or Ethereum’s upgrades, but something far more… shall we say, meme-orable . A recent Kraken survey has dropped a bombshell: a staggering 85% of U.S. crypto holders have ventured into the wild world of memecoins. Yes, you read that right. Despite the rollercoaster reputation of these digital assets, a vast majority of American crypto investors are taking the plunge. Let’s dive deep into what’s fueling this fascination and what it means for the future of crypto investment. The Allure of Memecoins: Why Are US Crypto Holders Hooked? Memecoins, born from internet jokes and viral trends, has carved a significant niche in the cryptocurrency market. But what exactly is drawing 85% of US crypto holders into their orbit? The Kraken survey sheds light on some compelling reasons: High Reward Potential: A whopping 76% of respondents believe the potential rewards of memecoins justify the inherent risks. The stories of overnight millionaires from Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are hard to ignore, fueling the hope for similar exponential gains. Market Credibility (Surprisingly!): An unexpected 44% think memecoins will actually improve the credibility of the cryptocurrency market. This might seem counterintuitive, but perhaps investors see memecoins as a gateway for wider adoption, bringing in new demographics and injecting fresh capital into the crypto space. Expected Outperformance: Another 42% anticipate memecoins will outperform other cryptocurrencies this year. This bullish outlook suggests a belief in the continued virality and community-driven growth of these tokens. Short-Term Gains: For 29%, the memecoin game is about quick profits. The volatile nature of memecoins allows for rapid price swings, creating opportunities for savvy traders to capitalize on short-term pumps. Diversification Strategy: And finally, 23% are using memecoins as a diversification tool within their broader crypto investment portfolios. In the world of crypto, diversification is key, and memecoins, despite their risk profile, offer a unique asset class to spread investments across. Navigating the Cryptocurrency Risk Landscape of Memecoins While the allure of memecoins is undeniable, it’s crucial to acknowledge the elephant in the room: cryptocurrency risk . Memecoins are notorious for their extreme volatility. Prices can skyrocket based on social media hype and celebrity endorsements, but they can also plummet just as quickly, leaving investors with significant losses. This inherent volatility stems from several factors: Lack of Fundamental Value: Unlike established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which have underlying technology and real-world use cases, memecoins often lack fundamental value. Their price is primarily driven by community sentiment and speculation. Whale Manipulation: The relatively low market capitalization of many memecoins makes them susceptible to manipulation by large holders (whales). A few large sell orders can trigger massive price drops. Hype-Driven Markets: Memecoin prices are heavily influenced by social media trends and online communities. This hype can be fleeting, leading to unsustainable price bubbles. Rug Pull Potential: In the darker corners of the memecoin world, the risk of “rug pulls” is ever-present. This is where developers abandon a project after raising significant funds, leaving investors with worthless tokens. Kraken Survey Insights: Are Memecoins a Wise Crypto Investment? The Kraken survey data paints a fascinating picture. On one hand, it highlights the widespread adoption of memecoins among crypto holders and the strong belief in their potential. On the other hand, it’s crucial to approach memecoin crypto investment with caution and a clear understanding of the risks involved. Here are some actionable insights based on the survey findings: Educate Yourself: Before diving into memecoins, thoroughly research the specific tokens you’re interested in. Understand their communities, development teams (if any), and market dynamics. Risk Management is Key: Never invest more than you can afford to lose in memecoins. Given their volatility, consider them a high-risk, high-reward asset class. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in the memecoin basket. Diversify your crypto investment portfolio across different asset classes to mitigate risk. Be Aware of Hype Cycles: Recognize that memecoin prices are often driven by hype. Be wary of investing at the peak of a hype cycle, and consider taking profits when prices surge. Long-Term vs. Short-Term Strategy: Decide whether you’re investing in memecoins for short-term gains or a longer-term play. Short-term trading requires active monitoring and quick decision-making, while long-term holding in the memecoin space is exceptionally speculative. Examples of Memecoin Success and Cautionary Tales The memecoin landscape is filled with both success stories and cautionary tales. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) stand out as prime examples of memecoins that defied expectations, achieving massive market capitalizations and creating fortunes for early investors. Their success was largely fueled by strong communities and viral social media campaigns. However, for every DOGE and SHIB, there are countless memecoins that have faded into obscurity or have been outright scams. Many memecoins experience a brief period of hype followed by a dramatic crash, leaving investors holding worthless tokens. It’s essential to remember that the memecoin market is highly speculative and unpredictable. The Future of Memecoins and Crypto Investment Trends The Kraken survey unequivocally demonstrates that memecoins are not just a fleeting trend; they are a significant part of the current crypto investment landscape. Whether they will continue to thrive and evolve or eventually fade away remains to be seen. Several factors will likely shape their future: Mainstream Adoption: If memecoins gain wider acceptance and integration into mainstream financial systems, their legitimacy and longevity could increase. Technological Innovation: Memecoin projects that incorporate utility or innovative technologies beyond just being a meme might have a better chance of long-term survival. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased regulatory attention on the cryptocurrency market, including memecoins, could impact their accessibility and growth. Community Evolution: The strength and evolution of memecoin communities will continue to be a crucial factor in their success. Conclusion: Embracing the Memecoin Mania with Caution The Kraken survey’s revelation that 85% of US crypto holders are investing in memecoins is truly astonishing . It underscores the powerful appeal of these unconventional digital assets and the evolving nature of crypto investment . While the potential for explosive gains is undeniably seductive, it’s paramount to approach memecoins with a healthy dose of skepticism and a robust risk management strategy. The memecoin market is a wild ride, offering both incredible opportunities and significant dangers. For those willing to navigate its volatility with prudence and knowledge, it can be an exciting, albeit risky, frontier in the world of cryptocurrency.

The digital currency revolution is gaining serious momentum in the Emirates, and the latest data is nothing short of electrifying. Imagine this: a whopping 41% year-on-year increase in crypto app downloads in 2024! Yes, you read that right. The appetite for digital assets in the UAE is clearly exploding, and we’ve got the inside scoop on what’s fueling this incredible growth. Let’s dive deep into the numbers and explore what this surge in crypto app downloads means for the future of digital finance in the region. Unpacking the Astonishing 41% Surge in Crypto App Downloads According to a recent report by Cointelegraph, citing data from the app analytics gurus at AppsFlyer, the UAE’s crypto app scene is booming. This isn’t just a slight uptick; it’s a dramatic 41% leap in crypto app downloads compared to the previous year. Think about it – that’s a massive influx of new users stepping into the world of digital currencies right from their smartphones. What’s even more fascinating is the timing of this surge. Here’s a breakdown of the key periods: Second Half of 2023: This period marked the lion’s share of the download activity. Q4 2023 (October-December): Get ready for this – over 1 million downloads per month ! That’s a sustained period of intense interest and adoption, suggesting a fundamental shift in how people in the UAE are engaging with crypto. This data paints a vivid picture: the UAE is rapidly becoming a hotbed for crypto adoption. But what’s driving this phenomenal growth? Let’s explore the key factors. Decoding the Drivers Behind UAE’s Crypto Adoption Spree AppsFlyer points to a couple of significant catalysts behind this impressive surge in UAE crypto adoption . Let’s break them down: 1. The Trump Effect: A Pro-Crypto Presidential Stance? Yes, you read that correctly. Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s increasingly pro-crypto rhetoric is cited as a contributing factor. While it might seem surprising, global crypto markets are highly sensitive to regulatory signals and the overall sentiment from major world leaders. Trump’s shift towards a more favorable stance on cryptocurrencies could be interpreted as a positive sign for the industry’s future, potentially encouraging more people to explore and invest in digital assets. This perceived validation from a prominent political figure can indeed influence market sentiment and drive adoption, even in regions far from the US. 2. Aggressive Marketing by Crypto Apps: Getting the Word Out The crypto app industry is fiercely competitive, and companies are pulling out all the stops to attract new users. AppsFlyer highlights “aggressive marketing efforts” as another major driver. Think about it – you’re seeing more crypto ads online, on social media, and maybe even on billboards. These marketing blitzes are designed to educate, entice, and ultimately convert curious individuals into active crypto users. This combined with increased media coverage and general buzz around cryptocurrencies creates a powerful wave of interest. [img src=”image-placeholder.jpg” alt=”Crypto app downloads in UAE surge”] Why the UAE is Ripe for Crypto Growth: A Fertile Ground Beyond these specific triggers, the UAE, particularly cities like Dubai, offer a particularly fertile ground for cryptocurrency UAE adoption. Several factors contribute to this: Tech-Savvy Population: The UAE boasts a young, digitally native population that is generally quick to adopt new technologies. Smartphones are ubiquitous, and online financial services are widely used. Pro-Innovation Government: The UAE government has actively positioned itself as a hub for innovation and future technologies. They’ve shown a willingness to explore and regulate the crypto space, rather than outright banning it. This regulatory clarity (or at least a move towards it) fosters confidence and attracts investment. Financial Hub Status: Dubai, in particular, is a major international financial center. This attracts a global workforce and sophisticated investors who are already familiar with and interested in alternative investments like cryptocurrencies. High Smartphone Penetration: Access to smartphones and reliable internet is crucial for app-based crypto adoption. The UAE has extremely high smartphone penetration rates, making it easy for people to access and use crypto apps. Benefits of Increased Crypto App Adoption in the UAE This surge in crypto apps usage isn’t just about numbers; it has real-world implications and potential benefits for the UAE economy and its residents: Financial Inclusion: Crypto apps can provide access to financial services for individuals who may be underserved by traditional banking systems. Economic Diversification: Embracing the crypto industry can further diversify the UAE economy beyond oil and gas, creating new jobs and attracting foreign investment. Technological Advancement: Increased crypto adoption fosters innovation in related technologies like blockchain and fintech, positioning the UAE at the forefront of the digital economy. Remittance Efficiency: Cryptocurrencies can offer faster and cheaper ways to send and receive remittances, which is particularly relevant in a country with a large expatriate population. Navigating the Challenges: Roadblocks to Consider While the growth is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges that come with rapid UAE crypto market expansion: Regulatory Uncertainty: While the UAE is becoming more crypto-friendly, the regulatory landscape is still evolving. Clear and comprehensive regulations are needed to protect consumers and businesses while fostering innovation. Security Concerns: As more people use crypto apps, security becomes paramount. Protecting users from scams, hacks, and fraud is a critical challenge. User education and robust security measures are essential. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their price volatility. New users may be unprepared for these fluctuations, potentially leading to financial risks. Responsible education about risk management is vital. Education Gap: While adoption is growing, a significant portion of the population may still lack a deep understanding of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Bridging this education gap is crucial for sustainable and responsible growth. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what can we take away from this crypto app downloads boom in the UAE? For Individuals: If you’ve been crypto-curious, now might be the time to explore reputable crypto apps. However, always do your research, understand the risks involved, and start with small amounts. Educate yourself about crypto security best practices. For Businesses: The UAE crypto market is clearly expanding. Businesses should consider how they can leverage crypto and blockchain technologies to enhance their operations, reach new customers, or offer innovative financial solutions. For Regulators: This growth underscores the need for proactive and balanced regulation. Focus on fostering innovation while protecting consumers and ensuring market integrity. International collaboration on crypto regulation is also increasingly important. Conclusion: UAE Embraces the Crypto Future The 41% surge in crypto app downloads in the UAE is more than just a statistic; it’s a powerful signal. It indicates a growing embrace of digital currencies and a willingness to participate in the evolving global crypto landscape. Fueled by factors like pro-crypto sentiment and aggressive marketing, and supported by the UAE’s conducive environment, this trend is likely to continue. While challenges remain, the potential benefits for the UAE economy and its citizens are immense. The crypto revolution in the UAE is not just coming – it’s already here, and it’s accelerating.

""Just Two…""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/vitalik-buterin-makes-bold-statements-about-bitcoin-btc-and-ethereum-eth-just-two/,"There are many projects in the cryptocurrency market. While it is very important to determine which project is long-lasting and solid when investing, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin explained his thoughts on this subject. Only Bitcoin and Ethereum Can Survive! On WarpCast, Vitalik Buterin argued that only Bitcoin and Ethereum have the essential property needed for long-term survival. Claiming that only Bitcoin and Ethereum can survive without foundations at this point, Buterin stated that only BTC and ETH have true decentralization features. “True decentralization can be tested by whether a blockchain can survive without a foundation. And at this point, only Bitcoin and Ethereum can confidently meet that standard.” According to Buterin, while Ethereum appears to be more obviously centralized than Bitcoin, ETH has also made significant strides in decentralization. At this point, Buterin emphasized that most of Ethereum's development now occurs outside of the Ethereum Foundation. “Most of Ethereum development happens outside of the foundation, with independent client teams and researchers. The Ethereum community is a large and globally distributed community that includes developers, users, stakers, and researchers. This broad participation ensures that the network is not managed centrally by a single entity. Additionally, Ethereum’s transition to Proof of Stake further enhances decentralization by reducing reliance on energy-intensive mining and opening up network participation to a wider range of users through staking.” The Allegations About Ethereum Saddened Me! In another statement, Vitalik Buterin criticized the intolerant claims made for Ethereum. Buterin expressed his disappointment in claims that Ethereum is intolerant of gambling-related practices like other blockchains. Speaking to questions at Tako’s AMA session, Buterin stated that he has no interest in participating in a blockchain if the blockchain community embraces such distorted ethics. “Perhaps the most disappointing thing for me lately has been some people saying that Ethereum is not good and that it is intolerant.

Hold on, because a prominent crypto analyst has just dropped a bombshell prediction! CryptoQuant CEO, Ki Young Ju, believes the current Bitcoin bull cycle still has legs, but he’s watching one key indicator like a hawk: Bitcoin ETF outflows. Let’s dive into his analysis and understand what it means for the future of the crypto market. Decoding the CryptoQuant CEO’s Bitcoin Bull Cycle Prediction Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, a well-known on-chain data analytics platform, recently shared his insights on X (formerly Twitter) about the ongoing Bitcoin bull cycle. His analysis centres around the demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs and how it influences market momentum. He argues that as long as demand for these ETFs remains positive overall, the bull market is likely to persist. But what exactly does this mean? Ju’s core thesis can be summarized as: Positive ETF Demand = Bull Market Continuation: As long as investors are net buyers of Bitcoin ETFs, indicating strong demand, the upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price is likely to continue. Negative ETF Demand = Potential Bear Market: Sustained net negative demand for Bitcoin ETFs, meaning more investors are selling than buying, could signal a shift towards a bear market. In essence, he’s using ETF flows as a barometer for institutional and, to some extent, retail investor sentiment towards Bitcoin. Think of it like this: ETFs are a major gateway for traditional investors to access Bitcoin. Their buying activity reflects a significant influx of capital into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin ETF Demand: The Fuel for the Bull Run? Since the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States in January 2024, these investment vehicles have become a crucial factor in the crypto market. They provide a regulated and accessible way for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. The initial surge in demand for these ETFs was a major catalyst in pushing Bitcoin’s price to new all-time highs. But why are Bitcoin ETFs so important for the bull cycle? Increased Accessibility: ETFs open up Bitcoin investment to a much wider range of investors who may be hesitant to navigate the complexities of crypto exchanges and wallets. Institutional Adoption: Large institutional investors, such as pension funds and hedge funds, can allocate capital to Bitcoin through ETFs, which are often more compliant with regulatory requirements. Liquidity and Market Efficiency: ETFs enhance liquidity in the Bitcoin market and can contribute to more efficient price discovery. Positive Sentiment Indicator: Strong ETF inflows signal positive market sentiment and confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. The Significance of ETF Outflows: Watching for the Bear? While positive Bitcoin ETF demand is a bullish signal, the reverse – ETF outflows – is what the CryptoQuant CEO is keenly observing as a potential indicator of a market downturn. Why are ETF outflows so concerning? Reduced Demand: Outflows signify that investors are pulling capital out of Bitcoin ETFs, indicating weakening demand for Bitcoin exposure through this route. Price Pressure: Sustained outflows can exert downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price as ETF providers may need to sell Bitcoin to meet redemption requests. Sentiment Shift: Significant outflows could reflect a broader shift in market sentiment, potentially signaling growing fear or uncertainty about Bitcoin’s future price trajectory. Bear Market Signal?: As Ju suggests, prolonged net negative ETF demand could be a crucial sign that the bull cycle is losing steam and a bear market might be on the horizon. However, it’s important to remember that ETF flows are just one piece of the puzzle. Other factors also influence the crypto market , including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and overall investor sentiment across the broader financial landscape. Navigating the Crypto Market: Actionable Insights So, what can you, as a crypto enthusiast or investor, take away from the CryptoQuant CEO’s analysis? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor ETF Flows: Keep an eye on the daily and weekly net flows of Bitcoin ETFs. Several websites and crypto data providers track this data. Look for trends – are inflows consistently positive, or are outflows starting to emerge? Context is Key: Don’t solely rely on ETF flows. Consider them in conjunction with other market indicators, such as on-chain metrics, trading volume, and macroeconomic news. Stay Informed: Follow reputable crypto analysts and news sources to stay updated on market trends and potential shifts in sentiment. CryptoQuant’s insights, like those from Ki Young Ju, can be valuable, but always do your own research. Manage Risk: The crypto market is volatile. Understand your risk tolerance and invest responsibly. Diversification and proper risk management strategies are crucial, especially during periods of market uncertainty. The Road Ahead: Bull or Bear? CryptoQuant CEO’s prediction highlights the critical role of Bitcoin ETF demand in sustaining the current bull cycle. While the market remains dynamic and unpredictable, monitoring ETF flows provides a valuable tool for gauging investor sentiment and potential market direction. The coming weeks and months will be crucial in determining whether the positive ETF demand continues to fuel the bull run or if increasing outflows signal the beginning of a shift towards a bear market. Staying informed and adaptable will be key to navigating the exciting, yet volatile, world of cryptocurrency.

The flagship cryptocurrency is up nearly 1% and trading around $97,200 as buyers look to push it beyond the 20-day SMA. BTC’s recovery comes after it fell to an intraday low of $93,437 on Tuesday. The recovery can be attributed to a positive meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin and the announcement of diplomatic relations between the two countries. BTC Can Remain Bullish Even After 30% Drop According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, Bitcoin (BTC) can drop to $77,000 and maintain its bull market in 2025. Ju suggested a 30% drop would keep the current uptrend at par with historical norms. According to Ju, Bitcoin remains in a bull cycle despite a month of sideways price action and an inability to reclaim $100,000. Despite this, higher levels will persist through the remainder of the year despite its recent sluggishness. Ju stated, “I don’t think we’ll enter a bear market this year. We’re still in a bull cycle. The price would eventually go up, but the range seems broad. I personally think that the bull cycle could continue even with a -30% dip from ATH (e.g., 110K → 77K), as seen in past cycles.” A drop to $77,000 would keep BTC above its previous cycle’s all-time high. The level has become a popular target for traders who want to see the market form a solid support base. Additionally, a CryptoQuant analyst believes BTC was due more price upside during the cycle. The analyst stated that since its halving, BTC has registered a growth of just 60%. “Despite the continuing halving cycle, I’d expect to see a sell in May effect, a sideways summer, and elevated price levels by the last quarter. The positive Q4 seasonality has been repeated in 2013, 2016, 2017, 2020, 2021, 2023, and 2024. A deeper correction could be multiple months or even a year away.” Bitwise Announces Donation To Support Bitcoin’s Open Source Development Asset management firm Bitwise has announced a $150,000 donation to help support Bitcoin’s open-source development. The donation aims to help strengthen the network’s security and boost innovation. The move is part of Bitwise’s commitment to allocate 10% of its gross profits towards charitable causes. The funds will be distributed across three non-profit organizations: Open Sats, Bitcoin Brink, and the Human Rights Foundation (HRF). According to Bitwise, the entities play a crucial role in the Bitcoin ecosystem, promoting decentralized growth and technological advancements. “Today, Bitwise is donating $150,000 to support Bitcoin open-source developers, who work tirelessly to secure and maintain the network. When the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ($BITB) launched, we committed to donating 10% of its gross profits each year. We’re delighted to make good on that.” Bitcoin To Reach $200,000 In 2025: Anthony Scaramucci Anthony Scaramucci has predicted BTC will surge to $200,000 in 2025, with a potential strategic Bitcoin reserve in the pipeline. Scaramucci made the predictions in an interview, emphasizing that for BTC to establish itself as an asset class, it must reach a market cap of $15-20 trillion. He also discussed Donald Trump’s plans for a strategic Bitcoin reserve, adding that bipartisan support is needed for its approval. However, he was critical of Trump’s involvement in crypto, calling it a distraction from positive regulatory developments. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC)’s recovery is gaining strength as it inches past $97,500. If BTC can move past $97,500 and $98,000, it opens the door for a move towards $100,000. The price dipped below a key level on February 18. However, it recovered thanks to buying activity at lower levels. BTC was trading in a narrow range last week and registered a substantial recovery on Wednesday after dropping to an intraday low of $94,118, rebounding from this level to register an increase of 2.17% and settle at $97,881. Sellers were back in control on Thursday as BTC dropped 1.24% to an intraday low of $95,315 before settling at $96,663. Buyers attempted a move past the 50-day SMA on Friday as BTC reached an intraday high of $98,929. However, it could not stay at this level and ultimately settled at $97,566 after an increase of almost 1%. Buyers retained control on Saturday, and BTC registered a marginal increase to settle at $97,705. Source: TradingView Sentiment changed on Sunday as BTC dropped 1.51% and settled at $96,225. Sellers retained control on Monday as the price fell 0.48% to $95,767. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $93,430 on Tuesday as selling pressure intensified. However, BTC recovered from this level to reclaim $95,000 and settle at $95,634, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday, and BTC rose 0.79% to $96,386. The current session sees BTC up over 1% and trading above $97,500 as it looks to push above $98,000. BTC bulls had not ceded much ground to the bears prior to this week's jump. While indicators were heavily bearish, the recent recovery has seen the RSI move to the verge of moving past the neutral zone. If it is rejected at this level, it would indicate bears still have the upper hand. BTC must reclaim $98,000 and $100,000 for bullish sentiment to return. A break above these levels could set the flagship currency up for a move to $105,000. On the other hand, if sellers retake control, BTC could plunge to $90,000. Buyers are expected to defend this level because a break below it will complete a double-top pattern, leading to a deeper correction.

Stuedlein opined that ETFs still carry numerous negatives presented by traditional finance tools. Swiss digital asset bank, Sygnum challenged the hype around crypto ETFs. Max Stuedlein, head of strategic digital asset solutions at Sygnum Bank, commented that ETFs carried limitations that are already staples of traditional financial assets. Sygnum Bank challenges ETF mainstream hype Swiss-regulated Sygnum Bank Sygnum argued that exchange-traded funds weakened crypto’s benefits, such as decentralization. In an interview at Consensus in Hong Kong on Wednesday, Max Stuedlein said the regular market hours that crypto ETFs operated on hinder crypto’s potential. He noted that ETFs are subject to reduced liquidity, restricted trading hours, and limited accessibility. The Sygnum Bank official said that these crypto features attracted users to decentralized finance and cryptocurrencies in the first place. The Sygnum Bank head revealed the company anticipates a divide between specialized crypto-native and traditional finance institutions. He expressed concerns that traditional finance players introduced ETF products and frustrated their efforts. Stuedlein added that investment tools like these threatened to eliminate cryptocurrencies’ distinctive features. He explained that Sygnum Bank intends to develop its products and services based on digital assets that generate value. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan expressed his views on the growing market interest in cryptocurrency ETFs. He said the ETF trend could lead to an influx of capital in the market. Hougan projected the US SEC could approve spot ETFs for over five digital assets in 2025. According to Hougan, all commodity-based exchange-traded products had regulated future markets. The CIO added that crypto ETFs have no regulated future markets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs record significant inflows CoinGlass data revealed that US spot Bitcoin ETFs accumulated $110 billion a year after their launch. The data highlighted that this amounted to 5.89% of Bitcoin’s market cap. The analytics firm also pointed out that Ethereum ETFs accumulated $10.37B, which amounted to 3.15% of Ethereum’s market cap. According to SosoValue data, Bitcoin ETFs recorded $71.07 million in outflows on February 19. The data revealed Fidelity FBTC experienced the highest outflows of approximately $48.39 million. Other US spot ETFs such as ARK 21Shares’ ARKB and VanEck’s HODL also recorded outflows. Abu Dhabi’s Sovereign Fund, Mubadala Investment Company announced it had invested over $436 million in Blackrock IBIT shares. Barclays also revealed that it owned 2.47 million shares of IBIT in a recent SEC filing. Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan were among other institutions that acknowledged Bitcoin ETF investments. JP Morgan analysts projected in January that XRP and Solana ETFs could record inflows between $3 and $6 billion upon approval. According to Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, the JP Morgan forecasts considered Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF’s market cap and total outflows. Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart predicted that Trump’s administration would favor more approval from the SEC. The analysts added that Bitcoin-Ethereum combination products would likely take the lead followed by Litecoin (LTC) and Hedera Hashgraph. Seyffart opined that Litecoin and HBAR had higher odds of approval than Solana and XRP. He noted it is unclear whether investor demand was present in the market.

With Stage 1 already sold out in just 16 days, early investors are positioning themselves for what could be one of 2025’s most explosive gains. Is BitLemons changing the future of online gaming? BitLemons is transforming the $450b traditional casino market with its smart GambleFi protocol.

Unlike conventional platforms, BitLemons operates 24/7, generating continuous revenue streams for token holders.

The document states: “Several participants suggest halting or slowing balance sheet reduction pending debt ceiling resolution.” These remarks have fueled optimism among Bitcoin experts who view the potential end of QT as a bullish signal. Many see it as a precursor to greater liquidity entering financial markets, a condition that has historically benefited risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The newly published minutes confirm that certain Fed officials are worried about the interaction between ongoing balance sheet reduction and the looming debt ceiling debate. The possibility of large-scale US Treasury issuance once the debt ceiling is resolved appears to be a key driver behind calls to pause or halt QT. Related Reading: Bears In Trouble? Bitcoin Liquidity Signals A Brutal Squeeze To $111,000 No explicit shift to quantitative easing (QE) was announced, but the acknowledgment that balance sheet reduction might be curtailed has been enough to stoke speculation in digital asset circles. The minutes must be unanimously approved by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), further suggesting an intentional message from policymakers. Implications For Bitcoin Renowned market commentator and host of the On the Margin podcast, Felix Jauvin, took to X to emphasize the significance of the Fed’s signaling, writing: “There it is, QT coming to an end this spring. Reminder that every FOMC member has to unanimously approve these minutes, this is intentional.” While Jauvin underscores the unanimity behind these minutes, he stops short of predicting an immediate shift toward QE. Instead, he points to a specific chain of events that the Fed seems to be navigating. The Fed has already reduced the pace of balance sheet runoff by half compared to its initial rate. Jauvin also notes that as the reverse repo facility (RRP) nears zero and the Fed reaches its target reserve level of roughly 3% of GDP, an end to QT becomes more likely.

Therefore, rather than pivot to QE, Jauvin believes the Fed could pursue a temporary Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption, allowing commercial banks to absorb additional government debt. “They are very very very very far from any sort of formal QE. Instead, it’s more likely they pursue an SLR exemption allowing commercial banks to be the marginal buyer of debt,” Jauvin predicts. A formal return to QE, Jauvin concludes, would only materialize if financial and economic conditions deteriorate significantly, including a major collapse in risk assets and a drop in rates to near zero. In response to an X user asking if ending QT is bullish without necessarily indicating an immediate move to QE, Jauvin offered a succinct explanation: “Therefore think for the current liquidity backdrop it is marginally improving in that we will have the possible sequence of TGA drawdown into QT ending into potentially SLR exemption, and that’ll be it for now. QE shouldn’t even be in the current vocabulary of discourse as it stands.” Renowned crypto analyst Pentoshi agrees, highlighting a previously published forecast: “QT coming to an end… My guess, QT ends by start of Q3. With all that’s taking place currently Trump will likely end up forcing it. Was correct on QT guess in Nov 21. Let’s see.” He cited how the conclusion of quantitative easing in late 2021 coincided with the end of the crypto bull run. Now, market watchers are keenly observing whether the inverse—a potential termination of QT—could spark renewed momentum for Bitcoin and other digital assets. At press time, BTC traded at $97,208.

It enjoyed its first significant rally on February 13 and February 14, when it rose from about $2.40 to above $2.80. Additionally, while it subsequently entered into a correction that took it below $2.50 on February 18, it again surged and reached $2.70. XRP 7-day price chart. Source: FInbold Though many investors have been hoping that the latest rally heralds the long-awaited soaring to new highs,on-chain expert Ali Martinez shared an X post explaining that the token may instead be facing another correction. Specifically, the analyst stated that the TD Sequential technical analysis ( TA ) indicator is hinting that XRP may have already hit a temporary top and that it may soon fall once again. $XRP could be gearing up for a pullback, as the TD Sequential indicator flashes a sell signal on the 3-hour chart after the recent 11% rebound! pic.twitter.com/k8SetFIQ8F — Ali (@ali_charts) February 20, 2025 Martinez provided no insights into how low the token might go in its likely imminent correction, but the current support and resistance levels indicate it will likely find a footing near $2.60 and that it is almost certain to stay above $2.38. The TD Sequential is a tool developed by the famous market analyst Tom DeMark that utilizes an asset’s historical performance to identify a likely reversal point. Notably, when it last flashed for XRP on February 18, it correctly warned of a short-lived but dramatic drop from $2.62 to $2.51. XRP fails to meet investor hopes for 2025 Despite the long-standing bullishness, XRP’s 2025 performance has been somewhat disappointing. Indeed, the token recorded a massive rally from its long-held levels near $0.50 after Donald Trump’s re-election sparked the hopes the U.S. will become significantly more crypto-friendly. The positive momentum was only reinforced when Gary Gensler, the former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair known for pursuing an aggressive policy toward the digital assets industry, confirmed he would be stepping down on January 20, 2025 – the day of Trump’s inauguration. While the original rally took XRP to new highs above $3.30, trading since hasn’t been as kind and the token remained in the rough range between $2.12 and $3 since February 1. It is noteworthy that XRP is not the only cryptocurrency whose performance has been lackluster in recent weeks. Bitcoin ( BTC ) – also expected to soar to new highs both due to the existing positive momentum and Trump’s promises of a strategic BTC reserve – has failed to stay close to its recent all-time highs (ATH) above $107,000 and has mostly been changing hands below $95,000. Why the cryptocurrency market is stagnating in 2025 The cryptocurrency market has, so far, been beaten down by broad economic and political uncertainty as the ceasefire in Palestine remains frail , Ukraine’s future remains unclear , and as many are fearful of how much Trump’s trade wars could escalate. The many coins and tokens have also suffered from spillover effects of shocks affecting stocks, such as the technology sector selloff that followed the release of China’s novel DeepSeek artificial intelligence ( AI ) model and the wider unease that emerged from the latest inflation data . For XRP itself, the still unresolved matter of SEC’s case against Ripple Labs – a severe headwind for many years – should also not be underestimated.

Crypto trading term explained,https://crypto.news/what-is-fud-in-crypto/,"Crypto FUDs are the Fear-Uncertain and Doubtful claims circulated to fight crypto assets. They are a marketing strategy used to make something seem worse than it is. Cryptocurrencies are not the first victims of FUDs but are among the most affected ones at the moment. Table of Contents What is the meaning of FUD in crypto? FUD in crypto: who uses it and why? Examples of common crypto FUDs How to tell the difference between FUDs and the reality FUD and the Media Conclusion While it is true that cryptocurrencies are a risky investment, some of the claims that are circulating about their nature are not accurate, which is why it is important to learn what is FUD in crypto, exactly. You see, FUDs can be instigated by anybody and circulated by almost any communication means, including large organizations like corporations, media houses, and governmental bodies. The FU D s in the crypto sector aims to dissuade people from adopting crypto assets. For instance, significant people like Warren Buffet have continuously claimed that crypto assets are a bubble that will burst. This is one of the largest crypto FUDs in play at the moment. However, this investor is going against his ‘advice’ as he is investing in companies that are eyeing crypto products like the metaverse and NFTs rather than going at the cryptos directly. Whom do FUDs benefit, and how can you tell the difference between a FUD and reality? In this article, we’ll explain the meaning of Crypto FUD, give examples of FUD, and discuss whether FUD is real in the world of crypto or just a speculation. You might also like: BTC ETFs recorded second-largest outflows amid market-wide FUD What is the meaning of FUD in crypto? FUD, which stands for “Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt”, is a term widely used in the crypto industry. Essentially, it refers to spreading false or exaggerated news, which can damage a digital asset’s value. The term is highly prevalent on social media platforms such as Reddit, Twitter, and Discord, where crypto enthusiasts congregate. FUD can create unnecessary panic and cause an asset’s price to plummet, making it a common tactic malicious actors use to manipulate markets. Crypto enthusiasts and influencers use FUD to describe statements of non-crypto believers, called FUDDERs or FUDsters. These individuals or parties criticize crypto projects without solid evidence, needlessly sowing unfounded fear, doubt, and uncertainty. FUDDERS are the opposite of laser-focused Bitcoin and cryptocurrency optimists who believe the future will be more transparent, communal, and driven by the underlying blockchain technology. A notable example of such crypto pessimists is Warren Buffet. Below are five classic points and statements from crypto non-believers who spread FUD. Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other cryptocurrencies are valueless Cryptocurrencies enable crime and cyber attacks Cryptocurrency mining is harming the environment Governments will soon ban BTC and crypto BTC is the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time. Crypto enthusiasts readily debunk such statements. In their assessment, they discover that their claims are bogus and don’t hold water. Now that you understand what is FUD in crypto, let’s discuss who uses it and why? FUD in crypto: who uses it and why? FUD can be used by several entities or individuals to serve their goals. Over time, observations have been made showing FUD as a tool used by the media, who disseminate certain information to drive fear, uncertainty, and doubts to the general public. Some influential public figures also use it. Critics like Warren Buffett often cause FUD when they conclude that BTC is an unworthy investment that’s nothing more than “rat poison squared”. Often, the goal of FUD is to draw capital away from cryptocurrencies. This way, the asset’s value is impacted, forcing prices down. Now that we have explained the meaning and motivation behind FUDs let’s discuss some common examples of FUDs in the crypto world. Examples of common crypto FUDs There are many crypto FUDS out there. Here are some of the common ones and the accurate information behind them: Crypto is a bubble that will burst Claim Some of the most influential people who have pushed this claim are Warren Buffet and Bill Gates. The two Billionaires believe that cryptos have no actual use and it is a fool’s gold, meaning that it will end one day and affect everyone. They believe that since there are no actual ‘products’ or backing for the digital money, a collapse is imminent, and once it starts, it will be unstoppable. Reality Cryptocurrencies have been around for over a decade now; while not all projects succeed in the crypto space, it is wrong to generalize them as a bubble that is set to burst in the future. These assets have caused a revolution in the world and birthed a new generation of digital awareness, forcing some governments to adopt CBDCs and BTC. They are also gaining support from institutional investors since they show growth and development by cropping up innovations. Such growth shows that the assets are bound to achieve greater heights rather than fail. Cryptos have no real value Claim This FUD is one of the main ones government officials use to fight cryptocurrencies. Like Bank of England Chief Andrew Bailey, some believe that cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value and could make investors lose all their money. This argument is based on the fact that cryptocurrencies are not backed by other assets meaning that they could collapse at any time. Reality While it is true that crypto assets are not backed by physical assets, it is also true that most fiat assets are only functional because people believe in them. Rogue central banks and governments can sabotage Fiat through overprinting, making them highly volatile. They are also not backed by anything, including the US Dollar. Crypto gets the upper hand against fiat money because it keeps appreciating while fiat money depreciates. For instance, most crypto assets, including BTC, have a capped supply at a certain amount. That supply ensures that the coin stays safe from inflation through printing, unlike Fiat money. Others are also capped and have burning mechanisms that lower their supply. In the long run, the asset demand increases, and so does their price. For Example, BTC began selling at under a dollar and now is at $30K 11 years later, while the USD has barely increased its value within the same timeline. Crypto assets are used for illegal businesses Claim This claim is hard to pinpoint several people who drive it as it is one of the classic ones. It has been there since BTC first began operations in the early 2010s. Many skeptics claim that the currency is shadowy since it is anonymous and thus the best fit for those who operate shady businesses. It is still in play, though it is losing power as more people are becoming blockchain literate. Reality While BTC has been used to facilitate illegal businesses before, everyone has used it, including major institutions and governments. Governments have worked closely with DASPs to control financial foul play proving that the asset is not an ark for illegal business organizations. You might also like: BOME falls 14% as investors overselling amid market-wide FUD Cryptos will be dwarfed by Quantum Computing Claim Mark Webber, one of the scholars at the University of Sussex, is among the people who push this FUD. Earlier this year, he published an article detailing that quantum computing will break cryptocurrencies, making their blockchain technology inefficient and easily hackable. Reality Webber and his team claimed that quantum computers would break the technology behind cryptos, making them easily hackable. Currently, there is no available computer that has the power to break the algorithms behind the blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies. Also, no quantum computer is either in development or in the designing stage that has the power to break those algorithms. Webber and his team failed to investigate and say what amount of computing power would be required to break the blockchain and how the computers would realize such power. While this possibility cannot be thrown out of the window completely, cryptos remain safe from quantum computing at the moment. Also, it is feasible to say that if developers from the last decade could design algorithms that will be safe even in the next hundred years, then the upcoming advancements will keep protecting Crypto from such attacks. How to tell the difference between FUDs and the reality The most important thing to do as a crypto enthusiast and investor is to learn how to spot crypto FUDs by evaluating them and then avoiding making decisions based on their influence. Some of the common characteristics of crypto FUDs include: They instigate the fear of total collapse. They are biased and based only on what could go wrong, excluding efforts and possibilities to avert the situations. They are strictly disapproving. They have no actual facts to back them as they originate from ‘professional points of view.’ They have inconsistent backing Here are the tips to follow while evaluating crypto FUDs and devising ways to get over them. Use reliable sources of information like live coin trackers alongside other sources like media houses. For instance, the New York Times once claimed that a single BTC transaction spends over 2000kWh of electricity. While this is a reputable media house, it is wrong on this claim. Always have an explorative mind while dealing with cryptocurrencies. Collect your facts and do quick facts checking across different sources. Avoid relying on ‘facts’ from individuals known to be against blockchain technology. Do not believe the hearsays surrounding cryptocurrencies in social media and other untrusted sources. Never follow opinionated facts about cryptocurrencies. Most of them are surrounded by misunderstanding, thus qualifying as FUDs. Examine the scientific logic of the technical FUDs before going into a panic. For instance, a FUD circulated on Reddit that the maximum height of BTC Blocks is 81.659 years. However, it was incorrect as the instigator had gone wrong on the calculation (2^32-1), which should have given 81,659 years rather than 81.659 years. You might also like: Justin Sun pledges to create $1b fund to ‘combat FUD’ after facing $280m in losses FUD and the Media The media exploits cryptocurrency daily by publishing news for their sole benefit and profits. Most FUD-causing headlines are click baits. Examples are when BTC is referred to as a “bubble” or “a money-laundering tool for criminals”. In essence, BTC has not been in a bubble, and solid statistics reveal that the coin has been consistently outperforming traditional markets by several magnitudes. BTC rose one million percent in the last decade alone and topped the performance chart. Most other crypto projects also followed the same trajectory. Meanwhile, using select cryptocurrencies like BTC for money laundering can’t be the best, even if these networks are pseudonymous. All transactions can be tracked online, and their IDs can be decrypted depending on how disciplined the sender or receiver is. The situation worsens because platforms demand the submission of revealing information as part of account registration and compliance with regulators’ requirements. Frequently, when FUD articles are dissected for facts, they turn out to be baseless and purely click-bait, meant to drive traffic. The same can be seen in cable TV and other media where FUD aims to whip up culpable people’s emotions for traffic. Conclusion Cryptocurrency FUDs should not deter you from investing if that is your choice. In the initial years of BTC’s operations, not so many believed in it. However, it has fought against all odds and has sustained its performance. Most of the people who criticized it back then have clarified that they were wrong about it then. That makes it probable for the current ones to claim the same in the future. Several FUDs filed the air that the coin is a Ponzi scheme, it will be banned, it is used in illegal trades, and has no real value. All these FUDs have been disapproved as the coin counts years of operation. It has gained value significantly over time, and some governments and institutional investors have also adopted it. The coin has also been banned by China and received no effect. Those developments prove that the bias against the coin and its alternatives are mostly misplaced and not a real reason to avoid them. They are being driven by people who do not believe in the real change brought by technology or are being scared of the change. The best way to avoid falling into the traps of such ‘advisors’ is to conduct your research on the assets and determine whether the FUDs are feasible.

In an announcement this week, KuCoin exchange , a leading platform for trading crypto, filed an application for a MiCAR license in Austria, as it plans to open its European wing, Kucoin EU Exchange GmbH. The application, if received, will allow the new entity to offer regulated crypto services to European citizens in the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA). According to the team statement, the latest application “underscores KuCoin’s commitment to meeting the highest standards of regulatory compliance”, as the exchange aims to grow its market share in the EU/EEA region. Speaking on the application of KuCoin EU in Austria, KuCoin’s CEO BC Wong, explained the exchange’s commitment and mission to be compliant and improve user experience around the EU region. In addition, Wong believes the choice to move to Vienna, Austria binds well with KuCoin’s strategic goals to enter Europe and the steps the country is taking to become a bedrock of crypto in Europe. “This marks a significant milestone in our steadfast commitment to executing a global, compliant strategy. Upon receiving a MiCAR license, we will enter the EEA market, which we deem strategically important,” BC Wong shared. “By advancing our compliance efforts, we are poised to better serve local users with more convenient, secure, and seamlessly localized products and experiences.” Introduced in 2020 by the European Commission, the MiCAR regulation aims to create a harmonised European regulatory framework for public offering and provision of services in relation to crypto-assets in the European Union. KuCoin EU receiving this license will allow the exchange to offer crypto services to customers across all EU and EEA member countries. This will ensure consistent access to crypto products and services while following a robust regulatory framework. The registration of KuCoin EU will follow the parent company’s ethos of fostering transparency, trust, and accountability in administering best-in-class digital asset services, offering users a secure and compliant trading platform. “We remain dedicated to fostering a transparent, responsible, and sustainable global digital asset ecosystem,” Wong added. Crypto Veterans Join KuCoin EU as Executives To ensure a smooth transition into the European market, KuCoin EU will be headed by two former exchange executives – Oliver Stauber, former General Counsel and Managing Director at Bitpanda and Christian Niedermueller, former CEO of Blocktrade SA, a digital assets exchange based in Luxembourg. The two will lead KuCoin EU as Managing Directors, with Oliver being CEO and Christian as the COO. Both are seasoned veterans in leading digital exchanges and will bring their wide expertise in financial market regulation and crypto exchange management, to streamline the launch of KuCoin EU. Speaking on the appointment, Oliver Stauber, CEO of KuCoin EU, believes his expertise will strengthen the exchange’s position in the European market and ensure a successful and regulatory-compliant business operation. “At KuCoin EU, our mission is clear: to create Europe’s premier, regulatory-compliant crypto asset service provider,” Oliver Stauber stated. “Upon receiving the MiCAR license we are committed to delivering secure, compliant, and cutting-edge crypto solutions that will redefine trust and innovation in the EU’s fintech arena.” Christian believes the team assembled to lead the new exchange is up to the task, as they aim to grow Kucoin’s brand and market share in Europe. Speaking on his appointment, Christian stated: “After having scaled up another European exchange and having my toes in the digital asset industry now for more than 9 years, I am very happy to help bring KuCoin to the next level in Europe. We aim to build a fantastic local team, have a sophisticated localized operational & product setup and also strengthen brand awareness massively in the years to come.” KuCoin EU Set To Be Headquartered In Austria Austria is quickly becoming a hotbed for crypto exchanges and platforms looking for registration in the EU/EEA market with Bitpanda receiving its license in the country. KuCoin EU becomes the latest crypto firm to move its operations to Vienna, Austria, citing the city as “a strategic hub for all European activities”. According to the team, Austria presents a fresh market for crypto following the recent implementation of the MiCAR accompanying laws, the stable and foreseeable regulatory environment as well as the huge talent pool. The move to Austria will allow KuCoin EU to challenge for market share in the European market while offering access to a wide range of digital assets while ensuring compliance with EU regulations.

Further insights into KuCoin's goals and operational philosophy can be explored through the KuCoin platform . The Role of Leadership in KuCoin EU's Success KuCoin has appointed two industry veterans to spearhead the European initiative: Oliver Stauber and Christian Niedermueller. These seasoned experts will serve as the CEO and COO, respectively, bringing extensive experience in financial market regulation and digital exchange management to the table. Their leadership is expected to be instrumental in fostering KuCoin EU's growth and ensuring compliance with European standards. Stauber expressed his enthusiasm for the project, stating, ""At KuCoin EU, our mission is clear: to create Europe’s premier, regulatory-compliant crypto asset service provider."" His vision highlights the exchange's commitment to security and innovation. Why Austria? With its stable regulatory environment and burgeoning talent pool, Austria has emerged as a prime location for crypto enterprises. KuCoin's decision to establish its European headquarters in Vienna reflects its strategic interest in tapping into Austria's potential as a European crypto hub. This choice is not just about geographical advantages; it signals KuCoin's ambition to revolutionize crypto trading across the continent by capitalizing on Austria's conducive business environment. The strategic position in Vienna allows KuCoin EU to effectively challenge for market dominance, providing a wide array of digital asset offerings while maintaining compliance with EU regulations.

DOGE fell around 30% after peaking at $0.4 in mid-January, failing to maintain crucial support levels at $0.23. Technical signals point to possible further losses, particularly a very oversold RSI. Likewise, XRP has failed to maintain momentum even though it first jumped from below $2.4 to a high of $3.3 in January. Retraced to $2.12, the cryptocurrency now boasts a vital liquidity zone between $2.10 and $2.50. Should XRP fall short of $2.10, historical price disparities point to a decline to as low as $1.63. Investors expecting a 5,000% return on DOGE or XRP in 2025 could be following a pipe dream. Two new cryptocurrencies, Mantra (OM) and Rexas Finance (RXS), can achieve this ambitious growth aim.

Over the past seven days, the token has gained 25.51%, showing great momentum in a positive market. Rexas Finance (RXS), which is transforming the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization market, is the one project that might provide unprecedented benefits. XRP Daily Price Chart, Feb. 5, 2025, | Source: Tradingview Rexas Finance (RXS): The Future of Real-World Asset Tokenization Leading blockchain innovator Rexas Finance lets consumers tokenize and invest in actual assets, including real estate, commodities, and collectables. Rexas Finance opens enormous development potential by bridging the gap between conventional finance and blockchain, accessing trillion-dollar markets. The RXS token's presale went live in early September 2024 at just $0.030 per token in stage 1. In stage 12, it is now priced at $0.20 per token, and in the last stage, the presale has surged by 580%. Rexas Finance has sold 446,884,216 RXS tokens thus far, raising more than $45,377,301. The presale, which will allow 500 million RXS tokens, seeks to raise $56 million. Set to launch on June 19, 2025, RXS will first tick at $0.25, preparing for a significant market arrival. Given the growing need for RWA tokenisation, a 5,000% increase path is not unrealistic.

Final Thoughts: Don't Fall for the DOGE & XRP Trap Although XRP and Dogecoin have been the main participants in the past, their odds of providing a 5,000% ROI in 2025 are low. Their price action suggests a fight to gain momentum, and the market mood is still weak. Rather, wise investors are looking to two highly promising initiatives for exponential expansion: Rexas Finance and Mantra. Early adopters stand to win noticeably, with RXS at $0.20 and launching at $0.25 on June 19, 2025. If you expect 5,000% ROI in 2025, your go-to tokens are Rexas Finance and Mantra.

Meanwhile, XRP, another former high-flyer, faced its own challenges, fluctuating between $2.10 and $2.50.

The oracle will be built in partnership with EigenLayer and Polymarket, utilizing the liquidity of the re-staking protocol and the EIGEN token. Polymarket is partnering with UMA Protocol and EigenLayer to build a new oracle for marking undeniable proof of real-world events. With that move, Polymarket will solve the issue of bets resolution, where some markets do not close, despite either the ‘yes’ or ‘no’ tokens going to 100%. UMA Protocol will track natural events and opinion markets, by analyzing natural language to gauge events. The oracle-building process will be transparent and engage the community. While some events are straightforward and resolve to one of the two possible logical positions, UMA Protocol aims to deal with edge cases, which revolve around natural language and have a degree of subjectivity. To that end, the protocol may train AI agents, testing their ability to yield verifiable data. Polymarket value grows in the past week UMA Protocol already secures Polymarket pairs with different methods, though it wants to expand and include community voting to protect a wider array of markets. In total, UMA Protocol secures $109.55M on Polymarket, with a peak above $455M during the 2024 election season. UMA Protocol secures up to $1B for different projects, based on its own reporting. DeFiLlama aggregates $281.77M across multiple other oracle users. Polymarket mostly relies on sports events for the bulk of its volumes. However, parts of its markets are linked to popular culture and social media, creating demand for a more complex oracle with a decision process utilizing the technology of Shelling Coin to resolve disputes based on coordinated community voting. Currently, the UMA token is used to incentivize users to resolve issues. The protocol wants to build other oracles that can use any token as an incentive. UMA tokens support 1,000 betting markets of varying complexity. As the prediction markets scale, UMA Protocol sees a problem with scaling a complex system of proposers, voters, and handling disputes. To avoid bribery attacks, UMA Protocol considers utilizing EigenLayer and its EIGEN token as a way to discourage attackers. EigenLayer has built an infrastructure to ensure skin in the game via a mix of staking and slashing in the case of flawed voting or bribery attacks. The next generation of oracles will tap the new technology of EigenLayer to build verifiable, accountable AI agents with real on-chain value. Polymarket switches to smaller bets Polymarket starts work on its new oracle as it switches to smaller bets from a higher number of users. The bulk of volumes still come from big sports games and several clear-cut political issues. Polymarket retained a lower baseline level, with spikes in activity tied mostly to large-scale sports events. | Source: Dune Analytics New types of bets rely on a natural language resolution and observing more varied data. One recent bet was set to check if Kanye West would launch a token by the end of February. The market gives a 33% chance for this event. Other markets with a complex answer include the launch of a Bitcoin reserve by the end of the first 100 days of Donald Trump’s presidency. The smaller markets still build up volumes of up to $10M. Those markets rely on the activity of over 70K daily users, with over 337K new accounts created in January. Overall Polymarket volumes ranged between $75M during the busiest days in January, and down to $31M as a baseline level . In January, Polymarket saw over 347K traders, down from 445K for December. The market is now down to a lower baseline level, with the top bet made for the NBA championship with over $1B in trading volumes.

40591291,https://crypto.news/?p=14338881,1740065876,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/40591291.jpeg,"Exclusive: Pi Network co-founders discuss mainnet launch, future, and tokenomics",https://crypto.news/exclusive-pi-network-co-founders-discuss-mainnet-launch-future-and-tokenomics/,"Ahead of the Pi Network mainnet launch which took place on Feb. 20, crypto.news had the opportunity to conduct a Q&A with Pi Network’s co-founders, Dr Nicolas Kokkalis, who is head of technology and Chengdiao Fan who is head of product. Pi Network now has 100 apps ready for mainnet. What is the strategy to ensure mass adoption of these apps? The Pi ( PI ) ecosystem, currently with over 100 Mainnet or Mainnet-ready apps, is fully functional and designed to be accessible and offer a seamless user experience through the Pi Browser, the interface to the ecosystem, and its utilities. The Pi Browser allows for easy navigation, facilitating a single sign-in for Pioneers that works across all integrated Pi Apps. It also enables intuitive and secure in-app payments through the official Pi Wallet app, which is directly integrated into the user experience. Moreover, PiNet allows for Web3 Pi apps to be visible and shareable via Web2 browsers, creating a kind of “loop” where Pi’s millions of users can share apps and support the network’s utility at the same time. Overall, these features make it as easy as possible for developers to build, and users to use and engage with the ecosystem, which thus promotes developers to further build and improve Pi apps. While developer tools are essential, the ultimate mass adoption of these apps relies on developers and businesses continuing to establish real utilities, and providing genuine use cases to the Pioneer community. With millions of Pi tokens, how do you plan to prevent hyperinflation and create a long-term model? Pi Network ( PI ) is designed with a carefully structured tokenomics model that seeks to balance accessibility, supply, and long-term utility. Our goal is to ensure that Pi remains stable by having a fair and wide distribution of tokens, and facilitating real-world use cases of Pi. Here’s how this was achieved: Pi promotes growth and accessibility while addressing potential stability concerns by having a declining token issuance model and enforcing identity verification as a requirement to obtain Pi. Alongside tokenomics is Pi’s mining mechanism, which balances the network’s need for growth, accessibility, longevity, and supply while right-sizing users’ rewards for contributions (including actions like security circles, using utility-based Pi apps, running Nodes, etc.) to the network. The model does this in part using a systemwide base mining rate that is (1) multiplied into each individual’s overall mining rate calculation and (2) adjusted dynamically based on a monthly supply limit (which is calculated based on the remaining total supply). The overall mining rate possible for each user may therefore increase or decrease monthly based on such supply and other factors—declining exponentially as Pi gets closer to supply limits rather than allowing endless, inflationary growth. Read the Mainnet Whitepaper chapters for detailed information on how the formula exactly works. Additionally, Pi Network as a whole is built around developing and providing long-term utility and use cases for its millions of users. By focusing on apps that solve real needs, merchant adoption in local commerce, and accessibility, Pi continues to function as an intrinsically motivated project with real utility backing its token. You have claimed that you expect Pi to be widely adopted by merchants. How will you ensure this happens on a global scale? Pi Network has enabled global merchant adoption by providing a complete ecosystem experience on Pi through apps and utilities in the Pi Browser, an active user base, and overall accessibility. For example, PiFest 2024, a one-week event, facilitated the transaction of Pi for goods and services between Pi merchants and Pioneer shoppers on a local level, attracting over 27,000 active sellers and 28,000 test merchants across 160 countries, and participation of over 950,000 Pioneers within just a few days. PiFest showcased Pi’s complete ecosystem for local commerce integration, connecting store discovery through Map of Pi, payments via Pi Wallet, transactions on the Pi Mainnet blockchain, and social sharing on Fireside Forum—all seamlessly working across different existing Pi applications Pi’s robust infrastructure, global user base, and real-world utility make it a scalable solution for merchants. With adoption already in place, Pi is positioned to become a widely accepted global token for local and online commerce. You might also like: Will Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, Upbit list Pi Network coin? Why has it taken so long to launch the Open Network? The unique and innovative design of Pi’s Enclosed Network period was a strategic choice designed to build a network of true substance and utilities with the best interest of the network, the community and individual Pioneers in mind. Historically, any meaningful creation in the world takes time, be it a scientific discovery, a technological innovation, or an impactful company. While people can fixate on short, optimistic timeframes of crypto projects, such a time frame is actually not the norm for true utility creation. Growth to such a large social network itself takes time, but this is a necessary environment and condition that can give rise to real-world utilities more focused on solving human needs in everyday life. The current Mainnet Phase 3 began in December 2021 with the launch of the Enclosed Network period, which meant Mainnet was live but with a firewall that prevented any external connectivity. This period set the stage for Open Network, allowing time for: Pioneers to complete KYC; Developers to build real apps and utilities for the Pi ecosystem; and Merchants to integrate. For example, the achievement of the local commerce integration with Pi mentioned before was made possible during this Enclosed Network. Now, as a result of the hard work and commitment from the entire Pi community over the last six years, Pi Network is taking the enormous next step in achieving the vision to build the world’s most inclusive peer-to-peer ecosystem and online experience, fueled by Pi, which the Pi community hopes will be the world’s most widely used cryptocurrency. Pi is ready to open our flourishing utilities-driven ecosystem where our now over 19 million identity-verified Pioneers can use Pi—a cryptocurrency with real-world functions and applications backing it.

With explosive presales, major upgrades, and strong bullish trends, the market is alive with potential gains. Among the top cryptos to join for short term, three projects stand out for their unique strengths and rapid growth. Bitcoin Cash has been making waves with its latest network developments, while Near Protocol is pushing forward with new partnerships. But the real excitement is centered around Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) , a meme coin that has ignited investor interest with its innovative presale structure and high return potential. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins—Arctic Pablo Coin, Bitcoin Cash, and Near Protocol. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale Ignites Investor Frenzy with Token Burns Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a high-potential investment packed with value-driving mechanisms. One of its standout features is its aggressive token burn strategy, designed to make APC scarcer and more valuable over time. Every week during the presale, unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation, reducing supply and enhancing investor holdings. After the presale ends, any remaining tokens will also be burned, solidifying APC’s deflationary model. This isn’t just a gimmick—it’s a strategy backed by the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring transparency and security. Investors looking for a high-upside project with smart tokenomics are keeping a close eye on APC as it continues its presale journey. Blizzard Bay: Arctic Pablo’s Presale Surges Past $1.42 Million! The Arctic Pablo Coin meme coin presale has now reached Blizzard Bay, the 11th stage in its journey, marking a key milestone. With each completed location, the token price climbs, making every stage an opportunity for early investors to secure their share at a lower price. Right now, 1 APC is available for just $0.000063, and with a launch price set at $0.008, early investors are looking at an astonishing 12,618.77% ROI potential. In under a month, APC has completed expeditions across nine locations, attracting a flood of interest from the crypto community. With over $1.42 million already raised, this presale isn’t slowing down anytime soon. Investors are rushing to grab APC tokens before the next price jump, recognizing this as one of the top cryptos to join for short term . As Arctic Pablo continues its journey, each new location brings increased momentum—don’t miss your chance to get in at the best possible price! Bitcoin Cash Gains Traction with Major Network Upgrade Bitcoin Cash has been making headlines with its latest upgrade, focusing on enhanced security and faster transactions. The recent implementation of CashTokens has expanded its use cases, allowing for smart contracts and token issuance directly on the BCH blockchain. This move positions Bitcoin Cash as a strong competitor in the race for blockchain adoption. As institutional interest grows and BCH’s ecosystem strengthens, many traders see it as a solid short-term investment opportunity. Near Protocol Secures Game-Changing Partnerships Near Protocol is surging in popularity following new strategic partnerships that aim to revolutionize Web3 development. The blockchain’s integration with major industry players has fueled speculation of a significant price rally. Near’s low-cost, high-speed transactions continue to attract developers looking for scalable solutions. With the latest partnerships driving adoption, Near Protocol is cementing itself as a serious contender in the blockchain space. Which Crypto Stands Out? Each of these cryptocurrencies offers unique opportunities, but one stands out for sheer explosive potential— Arctic Pablo Coin . While Bitcoin Cash strengthens its infrastructure and Near Protocol secures its foothold in Web3, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale momentum and strategic burns make it a top contender for high returns. With Blizzard Bay nearing its final phases, now is the time to seize the opportunity before the next price increase. Join the Arctic Pablo Coin presale now and ride the wave of the next big crypto success story!

Unsold tokens are burned weekly during the presale, and all remaining tokens post-presale will also be removed, ensuring a deflationary model that benefits investors.

Analyst Breaks Down Key Support and Resistance Levels,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/02/20/is-another-dogecoin-dip-coming-analyst-breaks-down-key-support-and-resistance-levels/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=is-another-dogecoin-dip-coming-analyst-breaks-down-key-support-and-resistance-levels,"An analyst from the More Crypto Online YouTube channel recently discussed Dogecoin's recent price action and warned of the possibility of another dip. He pointed out that Dogecoin has been stuck in a sideways consolidation phase over the last ten days. After the major February 3 selloff, the price briefly recovered but failed to break above the key $0.34 resistance level.According to the analyst, this action has trapped the price in a stagnant range, with no significant upward movement yet.Amid the ongoing sideways movement, the analyst suggested a potential for a new low. He explained that the current price action indicates Dogecoin could still be following an ABC structure.If this structure holds, the C-wave would typically end below the A-wave low, meaning a dip below the recent low of $0.238 could be likely. At press time, Dogecoin is trading at $0.256, showing a modest 0.83% gain on the day.Key Levels to Watch for Dogecoin Bullish ThesisThe analyst emphasized that the bullish outlook remains intact as long as Dogecoin holds above the $0.22 level. This price point aligns with the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement, and staying above it would support the ongoing bullish thesis.However, a break below $0.22 could invalidate the current bullish scenario, with the next significant invalidation level around $0.204.What Comes Next for DOGEMeanwhile, if Dogecoin remains above this critical support level, the market could recover and begin the third wave of a bullish move. Specifically, the analyst noted that for Dogecoin to confirm a reversal and start an upward trend, it would need to break above the first key signal line at $0.293. A more significant signal of a trend change will come if the price breaks above the upper signal line at $0.342.Overall, the analyst mentioned that the broader market, including Dogecoin, has been moving sideways recently, with more bearish days. While some coins like Solana have seen sharp corrections , Dogecoin has held its ground relatively well. However, with the potential for another dip, investors are advised to monitor the $0.22 support to maintain a bullish outlook.Moreover, Dogecoin's bull comeback would hinge on Bitcoin maintaining its price level around $97K or reclaiming the $100K mark. Over the past day, Bitcoin has posted a 1.45% gain.",Market|Doge|Dogecoin Price Prediction|Latest Dogecoin (DOGE) News Today,EN,0,0,TRADING|DOGE|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-02-20 15:45:45

On February 14, 2025, Milei publicly endorsed LIBRA, framing it as a means to support small businesses in Argentina. Following his endorsement, the token quickly surged in value, reaching a peak valuation of $4.5 billion.Nansen highlights that the token was minted at 21:38 UTC, and by 22:01 UTC, Milei’s tweet had sparked widespread interest. Early buyers, including algorithmic traders and high-frequency snipers, entered the market, accelerating the token’s rapid price increase. By 22:44 UTC, LIBRA had reached a high of $4.55 before experiencing an immediate decline. Later, Hayden Davis, who was involved in the project, dismissed LIBRA as a meme coin, contradicting the earlier narrative. Subsequently, Milei deleted his endorsement tweet after the token price had dropped by 80%. His later statement distanced himself from the project, claiming he had no prior knowledge of its details.Insider Trading EvidenceOnchain data revealed significant financial losses for many traders. By February 18, the number of unique holders had dropped from 50,700 to 35,770. Among the wallets that experienced a gain or loss exceeding $1,000, approximately 86.07% recorded losses totaling $251 million. Meanwhile, only 2,101 wallets secured profits, accumulating approximately $180 million.Several high-frequency trading wallets showed signs of insider trading. Two wallets that purchased LIBRA at 22:01 UTC and exited by 22:44 UTC realized gains of $5.4 million, with one wallet profiting $5.1 million alone. Another wallet, HyzGo2, was among the most successful, indicating strategic early buying and selling behavior. Conversely, some wallets, including XRfKhaCA, lost significant sums, with XRfKhaCA losing $407,000 from an initial investment of $6.5 million.Other wallets displayed links to prominent traders and possible insider knowledge. The address dysphoria.sol gained $341,000 from LIBRA and had prior profits from tokens such as TRUMP and MELANIA . Additionally, blockchain interactions indicated that traders associated with the same Bybit hot wallet executed transactions in a coordinated manner. This further raised concerns about insider involvement.Continued Trading Despite ControversyDespite the token’s initial collapse, some wallets continued trading LIBRA beyond February 15. A notable price movement occurred on February 17, when Milei reshared a tweet stating that LIBRA was not easily accessible to retail investors. The price briefly surged by 125% before retracing within 24 hours. However, between February 16 and 18, around 70% of active wallets still recorded losses.Further analysis indicated significant unrealized losses. Around 1,001 wallets held the token with unrealized losses amounting to $11 million, while only 71 wallets maintained unrealized gains of $0.54 million. Specifically, a crypto whale suffered losses totaling $2.78 million across two separate trades. Three days prior, the trader spent 17,450 SOL ($3.25 million) to acquire LIBRA but later sold for just 3,200 $SOL ($595,000), incurring a $2.65 million loss. In a previous attempt, the same trader lost $1.76 million on LIBRA. Meanwhile, another trader saw a net profit of $7.32 million from TRUMP but took losses of $617,000 due to MELANIA and an additional $1.76 million from LIBRA. In response to the turmoil surrounding LIBRA, Binance founder CZ donated 150 BNB ($100,000) to assist affected users. Shortly after, an entity behind the newly created token ""Broccoli"" liquidated its holdings and transferred the same amount—150 BNB ($100,000)—to CZ’s wallet.https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1891829911981261060 Profitable SnipersPer Nansen, one sniper profited $6.5 million, with blockchain data linking the wallet’s funding source to Bybit and multiple trading bots. Another significant player, 8bZsrR, appeared to generate $25 million in profits. Still, additional transaction analysis showed that this figure included token transfers to seven separate wallets, some of which exited at a loss.The situation also impacted the broader crypto market. The LIBRA collapse coincided with a decline in Solana’s total value locked (TVL), dropping from $12.1 billion to $8.29 billion, as traders reassessed the risk of speculative tokens.",Market,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BNB|EXCHANGE|SOL,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-02-20 15:48:16

Still in its presale stage, but the price has already rocketed over 450%, and analysts are purring over its potential for being the top crypto. Many believe it will outperform legacy cryptos Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP), which one should expect it to, as its new and new cryptos generally outperform older altcoins. But this is no ordinary cycle as both Solana and XRP projects are heavily connected with the Trump administration. Analysts tip Rollblock to be the top crypto this cycle As the crypto bull market pauses, Rollblock is continuing to capture the attention of investors and analysts, with many tipping it as the top crypto for the Altcoin Season. Already surged by an impressive 466.67% and a raise of over $10.5m, Rollblock's trajectory has taken even the most bullish of analysts by surprise. By blending the best of DeFi and online gambling, Rollblock positions it uniquely within the crypto space and as a disrupter to a $540 billion industry. The platform caters to users’ demand for a transparent and fair gaming experience, something the legacy gambling industry has long avoided. However, it’s not the gaming side that’s making Rollblock so attractive to investors. Rollblock’s unique innovation allows it to offer a revenue-sharing model, which distributes a portion of the platform's profits to all token holders. This incentivizes long-term holding, and with investors making more income based on the success of the platform, it also incentivizes a strong community spirit. Analysts have been particularly bullish on Rollblock since it first launched, but most wouldn’t have expected the presale to be so successful. That said, the bull market isn’t expected to top until Q4 of this year, and many analysts are now predicting this little-known Ethereum altcoin to be the top crypto this year. Solana has been the top altcoin this cycle, can it continue? Solana has been the top altcoin since the cycle bottomed in June 2022, with returns of over 20X before this recent correction. And with Donald Trump using the Solana network for his TRUMP Coin, it injected further bullish sentiment and validation of this Ethereum competitor. However, while Solana’s momentum appears strong, its market cap is so big that it limits the potential ROI compared to newer, smaller altcoin projects. That said, Solana should be a part of every diversified portfolio. XRP teaming up with Trump Administration as crypto goes mainstream XRP has been one of the most bullish investments since Donald Trump won in November. Loved and despised at the same time, there can be no doubt that XRP‘s future is confirmed as CEO Brad Garlinghouse has become a crypto regular in the White House. With Ripple actively participating in discussions on the regulation front and a stablecoin launch alongside XRP, it’s a bullish time for investors. Which altcoin will be the top crypto for the 2025 bull market? There can be no doubting the potential of Solana and XRP anymore, especially as both are being validated by the US government. However, for the big gains that only crypto can bring, it’s best to look at new altcoin projects, and Rollblock has the potential to be the next ten-bagger.

This new player on the Ethereum blockchain is in its presale stage, yet it has already soared over 450%, captivating analysts and foretelling a promising future. There is growing speculation that this altcoin could surpass established giants like Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP). In comparison, newcomers often overshadow older cryptocurrencies, although the links of Solana and XRP to the Trump administration add an intriguing layer to this narrative. Rollblock's Unanticipated Dominance in a Competitive Market Amidst the bustling crypto space, Rollblock stands out by capturing significant attention from investors and analysts alike. Despite the overall bull market's ebb, Rollblock has seen a remarkable 466.67% surge, amassing over $10.5 million in funding and surprising even the most seasoned market observers. Combining the best aspects of DeFi and online gambling, Rollblock uniquely positions itself to disrupt a colossal $540 billion industry. Its value proposition lies in offering a fair and transparent gaming experience, diverging sharply from the opaque practices of traditional gambling operations. Yet, Rollblock's appeal extends beyond gaming; its revenue-sharing model is a notable innovation, distributing platform profits to token holders, thus incentivizing engagement and community strength. The enthusiasm surrounding Rollblock isn't unfounded. With predictions for the crypto bull market extending to the final quarter, this little-known Ethereum altcoin is predicted to seize the top spot in the crypto space this year. The Remarkable Journey of Solana: Will Its Momentum Sustain? Since bottoming out in June 2022, Solana has been on a phenomenal ascent, achieving over 20X returns even before experiencing a recent correction. The introduction of the TRUMP Coin on the Solana network further fueled its bullish momentum, drawing interest as a viable alternative to Ethereum. Despite its upward trajectory, Solana's large market capitalization could restrict potential returns compared to smaller, emerging projects. Nevertheless, it remains a valuable asset for diversified portfolios. XRP's Strategic Alliances and Market Positioning XRP has garnered significant interest, especially following the political rise of Donald Trump. CEO Brad Garlinghouse has become a familiar face within the corridors of power, solidifying XRP's standing as a key player in the financial landscape. Ripple's proactive engagement in regulatory dialogues and the strategic launch of a stablecoin alongside XRP signal an auspicious period for investors.

Ho Kai Xin, 32, misappropriated about $4.2 million while overseeing payroll operations and attempted to cover up her actions by falsifying records and lying to authorities. As reported by local news outlet The Straits Times, Between October 2021 and October 2022, Ho exploited her position as an outsourced payroll manager at WeChain Fintech, a company handling salary payments for Bybit employees. Ho Kai Xin deceptively caused Bybit to send her USDT Court documents revealed that Bybit unknowingly sent a total of 4.2 million USDT to Ho’s wallets over eight transactions from May to August 2022. To execute her plan, Ho added rows to payroll spreadsheets and inserted her personal crypto wallet addresses next to the names of actual Bybit employees, deceiving the company’s finance department into believing the payments were legitimately being sent to employees. She then submitted the altered spreadsheets to her supervisor for approval, but the latter seemingly had a lot of trust in Ho, typically giving the go-ahead without verifying any data. Once authorized, Ho forwarded the files to WeChain’s finance department, which then saw through the payments. For cryptocurrency transactions, Ho went a step further by redacting identifying details from the spreadsheets before sending them to Bybit. This prevented the company from noticing discrepancies, which allowed unauthorized crypto payments to be sent to her personal wallets. Instead of hiding the stolen funds, the former Bybit payroll manager reportedly used the money to finance a lavish lifestyle, purchasing a $3.7 million freehold penthouse, a Mercedes-Benz AMG A45, and luxury items from Louis Vuitton. She moved the funds across six bank accounts and four cryptocurrency wallets to obscure their origin. Legal consequences: Court starts recovery efforts and probe Ho’s fraudulent activities were finally discovered on September 7, 2022, when a finance director at WeChain noticed unusually large cryptocurrency transactions. As an internal investigation began, she attempted to cover her tracks by slightly altering the wallet addresses involved in the fraudulent payments. On October 3, 2022, she was questioned about the discrepancies, in which she blamed the transactions on a fictitious cousin, whom she named “Jason Teo”, and falsely claimed that he owned the wallets receiving the stolen funds. The following day, she cut all communication with both Bybit and WeChain. Shortly after, she canceled her application for a Build-To-Order HDB flat and instead placed a deposit on the luxury penthouse. After Bybit started looking into Ho’s financial records in October 2022, the Singapore High Court ordered that all of her assets be frozen so she could not use the money. She continued to spend anyway, even though the court told her not to, and over the next two months she made nearly $840,000 in deals. Bybit filed a police report and authorities launched a formal investigation. During questioning, Ho stuck to her false claims about “Jason Teo,” leading to further scrutiny. Police spent 140 hours attempting to verify the cousin’s existence before finally judging that Teo simply did not exist. In July 2023, the High Court ruled in Bybit’s favor. Authorities recovered 1.17M USDT from Ho’s crypto wallets and $141,787 from her bank accounts. Still, a significant amount of the stolen funds remains unaccounted for. Ho hasn’t made any offer to repay the remaining sum. Sentencing and contempt of court charges Prosecutors charged Ho with 44 crimes in February 2024. They include cheating, money laundering, and giving police fake information. The court found her guilty of contempt on January 27, 2025. Her sentence to that end stands at six weeks in jail. Lastly, she admitted to 14 of the charges against her. Attorney Gerard Quek of PDLegal asked for nine months in jail during the contempt hearing for Bybit. He said that she should get a different and harsh punishment for not following the court’s orders. Ho asked for a sentence of no more than three months to be served along with her criminal punishment. She was representing herself. Justice Philip Jeyaretnam ruled that the contempt charge was distinct from the original criminal case. However, there was significant overlap in her actions.

And the frog meme did it in seven fewer months, too. It was Pepecoin madness at the time, but all that hype has fizzled out now. All that's left is some spike every now and again and a lot of old glory. That's not enough to get anyone anywhere, and that's why Panshibi is stealing the show in the memeverse with its stacked project. It's not like memes to have extensive use cases, but SHIBI is one of a kind. Hang on for more on the crypto. Pepe Hits New Lows Amid Bearish Influence The momentum on Pepe is bearish, and it has been so for a while now. With most of the crypto coins dipping at the start of the year and new meme coins surging in the past month, Pepecoin has not had a lot going for it. Consequently, the PEPE price is showing very mixed signals on its charts, too. The Open Interest in the token has dipped significantly, dropping from about $556 million in January to $258 million in February . Pepecoin crypto has also formed a death cross on its charts, as the token has been trading below its 50-day and 200-day Moving Averages. The bears are almost fully in charge of the Pepe charts, and the current PEPE value at $0.000009508 might fall even deeper in the future. Can Panshibi Beat Pepecoin Crypto Run? First off, no one is going to forget Pepe's run in 2023 in a hurry. It's the closest we've seen to the exciting Shiba Inu launch experience in 2021, even if it lasted two months for PEPE. Such launches offer ROI that make millionaires out of regular crypto traders, and Pepe's launch was no exception. However, just like Shiba Inu, there was a huge dip to follow the massive spike. Now that Panshibi has been tipped for similar gains, the trading community is immediately excited about the fortunes of the new crypto. Pepecoin crypto has been a sore topic for a lot of users since its launch, and Panshibi (SHIBI ) won't be going down that path. Here's a little of what to expect from the SHIBI tokens. Why Panshibi's SHIBI Tokens Are Drawing PepecoinComparisons When meme coins play the profits game, it's massive returns on the way. Panshibi's ROI from the presale was tipped to be about 14x, but even more than that is what users are to expect when the tokens list. The listing won't occur on decentralized exchanges at first, unlike how it goes for most tokens. Panshibi's developers have decided to let institutional traders have the first bite of the SHIBI cherry post-launch. What's the effect? Establishing a huge presence on the centralized exchanges is key to maintaining a strong capital base for Panshibi. If the price reaches a maximum level because of its launch on the CEXs, the token will be off to a flying start indeed. After that, SHIBI tokens will be available on DEXs where everyone will be able to trade the token. From launching on the centralized exchanges, analysts are tipping SHIBI for 140,000% ROI. You see why SHIBI tokens are getting the Pepecoin crypto comparisons? We also noted that institutional traders will be getting the first set of SHIBI tokens, but not until after the Panshibi community has had their fill. Get into the Panshibi ecosystem now! The presale is your chance to accumulate the SHIBI tokens before launch day. The launch price is set at $0.026, and the SHIBI tokens currently sell for $0.005. That's some 400% in ROI before launch and a bucket load afterward. Don't sleep on SHIBI; it's the new Pepecoin crypto and it's loads better!

However, such astronomical hype was short-lived, with its prominence fading into history. Enter Panshibi , which is catching attention with its promising features. The Bear Market's Grip on Pepecoin For some time, Pepecoin has struggled against a bearish market trend. Since the start of the year, its value has been in decline, unlike newer meme coins that have experienced upward movements. Data indicates a drastic drop in Pepecoin's Open Interest, plummeting from a staggering $556 million in January to $258 million in February. The coin continues to trade below its critical 50-day and 200-day moving averages, painting a bleak picture for its future. Why Panshibi Might Eclipse Pepecoin While Pepecoin made waves in 2023, comparable to Shiba Inu's historic rise, the excitement was fleeting. Panshibi is anticipated to replicate and possibly surpass such success. Its presale offers substantial ROI, and analysts predict remarkable growth post-launch, a promise reminiscent of the heyday of meme coins. Panshibi distinguishes itself by strategically targeting institutional traders initially, setting the stage for a strong market entry and promising potential returns of up to 140,000%. Understanding the Buzz Around SHIBI Tokens The anticipated listing strategy for Panshibi's SHIBI tokens involves a phased rollout, prioritizing centralized exchanges (CEXs) to ensure a solid market foundation. As Panshibi secures its position in major exchanges, the groundwork is set for remarkable performance. After the initial launch phase, tokens will be made available on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), expanding accessibility and liquidity. This strategic approach positions SHIBI as a strong contender for impressive market gains, drawing comparisons to Pepecoin's early days. Join the Panshibi Movement With a presale pricing SHIBI tokens at $0.005, set against an anticipated launch price of $0.026, the potential for early investors is substantial. The buzz around Panshibi suggests a golden opportunity for those looking to ride the wave of the next big meme coin.

In today’s issue, Beth Haddock from Warburton Advisers takes us through the first 30 days of Trump’s term and analyzes the far-reaching impact his administration could have on the crypto industry. Then, DJ Windle from Windle Wealth answers questions you may have from the article in Ask and Expert. – Sarah Morton 30 Days of Trump: What’s Changed for Crypto? A year ago, skepticism and stalled policy progress stunted crypto’s growth. Trump’s election win has shifted the Overton window (referring to the change in political policies that people are willing to accept) on crypto’s acceptance, but will that lead to sustainable growth and regulatory clarity? His January 23 Executive Order (EO) addressing crypto prioritizes ""responsible growth,"" a shift from President Biden’s 2022 EO focused on ""responsible development."" Early actions — rescinding SAB 121 , ending Operation Chokepoint 2.0 , pardoning Ross Ulbricht and appointing new leaders — signal change. One month in, progress is clear, but obstacles remain. A divided Congress, slow legislation and market speculation — seen in memecoins like $TRUMP and $MELANIA — complicate the path forward. The key question: Are we just moving past FTX, or will crypto be recognized as critical to Web3 innovation? Three Key Trends to Watch 1. Acceleration of Product Innovation The chart above clearly illustrates the Trump administration’s early focus on leadership changes and rollbacks of enforcement-driven policies. With regulatory enforcement easing, U.S. crypto development no longer needs to wait — or move offshore. The SEC’s Crypto 2.0 initiative, led by Commissioner Peirce, shifts from enforcement-first policies to a new Crypto Taskforce. Meanwhile, the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, chaired by crypto advocate David Sacks, signals a more supportive stance. These shifts create space for innovation, allowing blockchain to prove its value before regulations catch up. Key areas for progress include stablecoin regulation, clearer digital asset custody requirements, hybrid TradFi-crypto products (such as expected Solana and ETH ETFs) and global payments advancements through partnerships like those with X Money and Visa. Resolving complex policy priorities will take time, as reflected in a16z’s 11 priorities and the Crypto Bar ’s open letter , highlighting the breadth of influential voices. As adoption grows, the network effect of successful crypto products will push for consensus-driven regulation. But without meaningful legislative action, the industry risks a return to uncertainty when Washington’s leadership inevitably shifts again. 2. Speculation vs. Sustainable Growth Amid all this optimism, crypto still struggles to establish credibility and prove itself as a force for responsible innovation. The opportunity to revolutionize finance is here — but is market speculation part of the growth or is it hindering sustainable growth? Memecoins like $TRUMP and $MELANIA surged just before the inauguration, reflecting demand for high-risk, culturally driven assets, while also raising regulatory concerns about volatility and integrity. The class action lawsuit against pump.fun underscores skepticism of growth untethered to sustainable utility. To maintain credibility, crypto must distinguish real-world and potential wealth creation applications from speculative assets. Fraud and misrepresentation remain illegal, whether in memecoins, penny stocks or collectibles. As the market evolves, businesses and investors must prioritize due diligence to separate hype from lasting potential. 3. The Urgent Need for Regulatory Clarity Despite leadership changes, there remains an urgent need for clear, enforceable crypto regulation. Key unresolved issues include: Addressing fraud and consumer protections without stifling innovation and decentralized finance Defining digital asset regulatory authority among agencies Establishing fit-for-purpose AML frameworks for stablecoins and other innovations With crypto-friendly leaders now at the SEC and CFTC , regulatory progress is likely, but legislative action will take time. While Congress is considering proposals like the GENIUS Act, the STABLE Act, and new rules for market structure, pragmatic change isn’t guaranteed this year. For now, the industry must keep shifting the Overton window toward recognizing crypto’s role in U.S. tech leadership, public policy and economic security. Until comprehensive laws emerge, regulatory leadership — seen with the CFTC pilot program and recent Federal Reserve speech — must guide a stable path for growth. The Path Forward This year is pivotal — not just because toxic policies are fading and leadership has shifted, but because momentum is driving Web3 and blockchain forward. The goal isn’t just ""responsible growth"" but sustainable growth anchored in regulatory clarity. If the industry balances innovation with strong protections against fraud and theft, crypto’s resilience and credibility will be strengthened. With tech-neutral regulations, the U.S. won’t just lead in crypto and AI policy — we’ll also be ready for whatever else is next, from quantum computing to future breakthroughs. Sustainable innovation matters because technological progress is inevitable. - Beth Haddock, managing partner and founder, Warburton Advisers Ask an Expert Q: Who is Ross Ulbricht? A: Ross Ulbricht created Silk Road, an early bitcoin-powered marketplace that demonstrated crypto’s potential for decentralized commerce — both legally and illegally. His life sentence became a rallying cry in the crypto community, with many arguing it was excessive and highlighting broader debates on financial privacy and government control. His recent pardon has reignited discussions on justice reform and crypto’s role in the future of digital trade. Q: What are the risks of memecoins? A: Memecoins like $TRUMP and $MELANIA are highly speculative, with prices driven more by social media hype than real utility. While they can generate quick profits, they also carry extreme volatility and risks of manipulation. Many lack long-term viability, so investors should approach them with caution and avoid putting more in them than they can afford to lose. Q: How could state bitcoin investments impact adoption? A: If states allocate reserves to bitcoin, it could legitimize crypto as a store of value, encouraging institutional investors and policymakers to take it more seriously. This could accelerate regulatory clarity, enhance calls for clearer tax guidelines and integrate bitcoin into broader financial infrastructure, helping solidify its role in the economy. - DJ Windle, founder and portfolio manager, Windle Wealth Keep Reading Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, has invested approximately $437 million into BlackRock's bitcoin ETF. Google looks to simplify bitcoin adoption with wallet integration alongside existing authentication protocols.

While meme coins remain popular, investors are realizing that hype alone isn’t enough for long-term gains. That’s why many are shifting to Mutuum Finance, an emerging DeFi-focused altcoin. Priced at $0.01 in its first phase of presale, Mutuum Finance is grabbing attention with its potential for life-changing gains and revolutionary technology. This opening phase is now more than 75% sold out, raising over $835,000 in just a few days. Unlike Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, Mutuum Finance offers real utility in decentralized lending and borrowing, making it more than just a speculative play. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A High-Growth Opportunity in DeFi The Mutuum Finance presale is rapidly gaining traction, offering investors an early opportunity to secure significant returns. With the token currently priced at $0.01, its value will progressively increase to $0.06 by the end of the presale, giving early buyers a 600% gain before launch. Market analysts anticipate that once trading begins, Mutuum Finance could surge past $1, presenting an impressive 100x growth opportunity. This means that even $100 invested right now will hit $10,000 before the end of 2025. Investor participation continues to rise, with over $835,000 raised and more than 1,511 investors already involved. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with a Dual-Lending Model Mutuum Finance is reshaping decentralized lending by introducing a flexible dual-lending system designed to accommodate diverse financial needs. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model allows users to deposit stablecoins such as USDT into liquidity pools governed by smart contracts, generating passive income. Borrowers can then secure loans using crypto assets like ETH. In addition, the project features a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model, that removes intermediaries, enabling direct negotiations between lenders and borrowers. This approach provides greater flexibility in setting interest rates and collateral terms, making lending more adaptable and user-driven. By combining these two models, Mutuum Finance offers a lending ecosystem that balances efficiency, decentralization, and control. Strengthening Stability with a Fully Collateralized Stablecoin To enhance security and reliability, Mutuum Finance is launching a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum Mainnet. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins that are prone to volatility, this fully collateralized asset ensures greater stability by requiring borrowers to deposit more than they borrow. For instance, securing $10,000 worth of crypto allows a user to borrow $8,000, maintaining a healthy overcollateralization ratio. This mechanism reinforces trust while improving lending efficiency. Mutuum Finance has implemented a structured economic model to drive long-term value and maintain investor confidence. Discounted presale prices offer early investors a unique opportunity for strong potential gains. Allocations for liquidity pools, security reserves, and strategic partnerships ensure continuous growth and development. A controlled presale approach mitigates inflation risks, preserving long-term token stability and market strength. Exclusive Incentives to Reward Early Participation To encourage early adoption, Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway, with 10 winners each set to receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. A referral program further incentivizes investors by offering additional rewards for bringing new participants into the community. These initiatives aim to foster engagement and accelerate the platform’s growth. A cutting-edge lending framework, a robust token economy, and strong early investor interest is positioning Mutuum Finance as a dominant force in DeFi. As phase two approaches and token prices rise, now is the ideal time to secure a position before the next price increase. Mutuum Finance offers more than just a 10x return. At launch alone, phase one investors will reap a 600% gain. If the $1 mark is hit after launch, that’s a 100x gain for early birds. Join the presale now, the chance to purchase at the lowest possible price is quickly diminishing with phase one nearing completion.

The SEC has been in reset mode on its courtroom entanglements with crypto issues as the leadership elevated by President Donald Trump has been reversing years of the agency's adversarial stance. The latest move was to formally drop the appeal in a case in which the Blockchain Association and Crypto Freedom Alliance of Texas sued the SEC and a Texas federal judge agreed that the regulator ""exceeded its statutory authority."" ""With new leadership at the agency leading to today’s final dismissal, we’re looking forward to productive conversations between industry and the SEC moving forward – and a brighter future for digital assets in the United States,” said Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith, in a statement. The rewritten dealer rule was one of the agency's major efforts at crypto rulemaking under the tenure of former chairman Gary Gensler, and it was crafted with the agency's longtime stance in mind that existing laws were sufficient to handle the oversight of the digital assets space. The industry's position was that the rule made untenable demands on decentralized finance (DeFi) and also roped in crypto traders who didn't offer dealer services. The agency didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the legal withdrawal. Since being installed as the SEC's acting chairman, Mark Uyeda, has begun to aggressively overhaul the agency's senior staff and its legal approach to the crypto sector. He's set to be replaced whenever Trump's permanent pick, Paul Atkins, can be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, though Atkins is expected to continue in the same path. Earlier this month, the SEC also sought to pause its enforcement fight with Binance over the agency's accusations of securities violations so the matter could be resolved in another way.

Amid a wave of crypto exchange-traded fund filings, the Securities and Exchange Commission has acknowledged another bid to reintroduce staking as a component of spot Ethereum ( ETH ) exchange-traded funds. “The ether staked by the Sponsor on behalf of the Trust will consist exclusively of ether owned by the Trust,” said a filing submitted by Cboe BZX Exchange on behalf of 21Shares for the firm’s 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF. You might also like: Experts: Spot Ether ETFs not the boon industry thinks The inclusion of staking in exchange-traded funds was widely discussed last year when issuers submitted applications to list and trade Ethereum funds on U.S. national exchanges. Expectations that Ethereum staking would be allowed in exchange-traded funds diminished after the Securities and Exchange Commission, under former chair Gary Gensler, opposed the idea. Agency staff instructed all prospective spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund issuers to remove staking-related language from their applications. The directive aligned with Gensler’s stance that proof-of-stake tokens should be classified as securities and that staking services must register with the agency to operate legally. Gensler’s departure and President Trump’s return to Washington marked a shift in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approach. The agency’s Crypto Task Force, established by acting chair Mark Uyeda, recently met with Jito Labs and Multicoin Capital to discuss staking in Ethereum ETFs. The outcome of these discussions remains unclear. However, the agency has acknowledged at least two filings for public comment on whether to permit Ethereum staking in Wall Street ETFs. Last week, NYSE Arca proposed greenlighting staking in Grayscale’s Ethereum exchange-traded fund suite, signaling a renewed push for staking inclusion in regulated investment products.

In response to the development, XRP lawyer John Deaton reflected on Ripple and XRP’s evolution over the past four years. Notably, the XRP ecosystem has undergone significant transformations since the SEC lawsuit in 2020. Though Ripple faced unprecedented challenges over the period, recent developments including major court wins and Donald Trump’s re-election have marked a turning point. Let’s unveil XRP’s major developments over the period, leading to the SEC’s positive approach to XRP ETFs. SEC Acknowledges XRP ETFs: John Deaton Weighs In The SEC’s acknowledgment of XRP ETFs has sent shockwaves of optimism through the Ripple community. In a series of surprising events, the SEC recognized multiple asset manager’s XRP ETFs, fueling excitement. Commenting on this bullish development, pro-XRP attorney John Deaton stated, “What a difference four years of litigation and an election can bring.” Via his latest X post , Deaton offered the community a unique perspective on XRP’s transformation over the past few years. According to his remarks, the SEC’s recent move is largely attributed to Ripple’s court wins and Donald Trump’s presidential win in the 2024 election. XRP ETF Acknowledgement: Broader Implications Major investment firms are vying to launch an exchange-traded fund tracking XRP. The frenzy began when Grayscale proposed converting its XRP Trust into an ETF, prompting CBOE and Nasdaq to file 19b-4 applications. The SEC’s subsequent acknowledgment of applications from Grayscale, 21Shares, and Bitwise sparked widespread optimism. Most recently, the SEC has also recognized XRP ETF applications from CoinShares, WisdomTree, and Canary Capital, further fueling excitement. Key Factors Influencing XRP’s Journey Notably, the SEC’s recent XRP ETF acknowledgment has been influenced mainly by two major events: Ripple’s court wins and Donald Trump’s election win. This development boosts optimism, even if it doesn’t confirm a potential green light for the ETF launch . The crypto regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the platform violated the federal securities law and raised $1.3 billion by offering unregistered securities. After a long battle, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP in its digital token form is not a security. In a subsequent judgment in August 2024, Judge Torres drew a clear line between Ripple’s retail and institutional sales, declaring the retail sales to be legitimate. Significantly, this regulatory status has contributed to the SEC’s recognition of the XRP ETFs. As per Deaton’s comments, in addition to this development, Trump’s re-election is another major event that impacted Ripple’s journey. Specifically, Trump’s pro-crypto stance and the SEC’s regulatory shifts have potentially paved the way for a more favorable environment for XRP. Ripple’s Evolution Since 2020 SEC Lawsuit Ripple, founded in 2012, had established itself as a leading global payments platform by 2020. But its momentum was halted by the SEC lawsuit. Prior to the lawsuit, XRP remained a major player alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. The token hit an all-time high of $3.317 in the 2017-2018 bull run, marking a staggering hike of 19,000%. However, the lawsuit severely affected XRP’s trajectory. Major exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken suspended XRP from trading following the lawsuit. Soon, the token’s price and market cap plummeted with XRP losing its ground. Notably, XRP experienced a remarkable resurgence, fueled by Ripple’s courtroom victories and Trump’s election win. The cryptocurrency reclaimed its third spot on CoinMarketCap, soaring to a high of $3.2 as it eyed its all-time high. This upward trajectory was further reinforced by the SEC’s recognition of XRP ETFs. It was highlighted by John Deaton, underscoring Ripple’s continued growth and momentum.

We finally have a pro-crypto US government, and we're set for several altcoin ETFs later this year, which will likely inject a flood of money into the space. But what is the best crypto to buy now? This article will take a look at the top 3 altcoin projects that we believe will make significant gains for investors: Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL), but starting with the exciting new GambleFi project, Rollblock . Is Rollblock The Best Crypto to Buy Now? Rollblock (RBLK) has taken the market by storm as its presale continues to break new ground. Analysts have been aware of this exciting new altcoin project since day one, but with over $10.5m raised and a token appreciation of 450%, they're now adjusting their early bullish predictions. So, what is it about RBLK that makes it potentially the best crypto to buy? Rollblock boasts an innovative approach to the online gambling market, thanks to its DeFi features that allow its users to earn a passive income. Its main appeal is its revenue-sharing model, which offers RBLK token holders a share of the casino's profits. Moreover, with a 30% APY available for staking, Rollblock is the DeFi platform for anyone looking to build a passive income. It's an exciting time for Rollblock investors. The presale success has surprised many, but with the $540 billion gambling sector ripe for disruption, the potential for this token is second to none. Remember, the one thing that secured the gambling industry's moat was its control, but with Rollblock offering transparency on all transactions, its potential is huge. Is Rollblock the best crypto to buy now? With a staggering 450% increase in price since launch, Rollblock's performance is impressive. Best of all, however, the biggest returns are expected after its mainnet launch, which should be when the bull market is in full flow. Cardano Price Looking More Stable Cardano has recently shown increased price stability after a poor 2024. This is attributed to ongoing network upgrades and a growing adoption of Cardano smart contracts. With its strong academic backing, Cardano's steady approach could lead to sustained growth, especially as the Cardano team continues to roll out improvements. It's been a tough couple of years for ADA investors, but now, as the platform finally looks like a sustainable blockchain solution, there's potential for it to be a competitor to Ethereum after all. Solana to Continue Impressive Rise in Altcoin Space Solana has been making significant strides in the layer-1 space, proving to be the only true competitor to Ethereum so far. Known for its blazing-fast speeds and cheap transactions, Solana has attracted more developers than any other project of late. This is clear in the memecoin space, where BONK and dogwifhat have been the two leaders since 2023. The fact that President Trump launched his memecoin on Solana is a signal that its rise should continue. Top 3 Altcoin Projects To Buy in 2025 There are too many altcoins to study the entire market, but three that we believe will make significant gains this year are Cardano, Solana, and Rollblock. They offer brand recognition, price stability, and an exciting chance at getting those huge gains that are only possible in a crypto bull market.

The launch ended investors’ wait and mining for the past six years. The long-anticipated transition from an enclosed mainnet, which had been operational since 2021, will now allow “pioneers” to trade their Pi coins freely and integrate with external networks. Pi coin surged over 40% within the first hour of the mainnet launch. Open mainnet wait is over: Pi network’s journey to launch As explained by the Pi Network core development team, the project has undergone four stages: the beta phase, testnet, enclosed mainnet, and open mainnet. The first phase, launched on March 14, 2019, focuses on user acquisition and testing the mobile mining application. Users had their first experience with Pi’s mining model, where they could mine Pi coins by tapping a button once every 24 hours on their smartphones. The Pi network team reportedly asked node operators to help make sure the blockchain was stable enough to handle transactions for a large user base when it moved to the testnet phase on March 14, 2020. In December 2021, Pi entered the enclosed mainnet phase. The blockchain was fully operational, but a firewall was mounted to restrict any external transactions and block activity outside of the ecosystem. The period allowed pioneers to complete Know Your Customer (KYC) verification and migrate their Pi coins to the live blockchain. The final transition to the open mainnet on Thursday removed these restrictions, allowing Pi to connect with external networks and function as a fully open blockchain. With the open mainnet, developers on the Pi blockchain can launch their decentralized applications (DApps) and make them available to the broader crypto industry. However, the developers have yet to release this feature, and the dates are yet to be announced. According to Pi Network’s blog , over 100 applications have already been built within the Pi ecosystem, covering sectors like decentralized finance, gaming, and online marketplaces. Pioneers can now move their tokens to external wallets of crypto trading platforms, as it is now trading on several centralized exchanges, including OKX, Bitget, and MEXC. Pi coin price volatility post-exchange listings Following the open mainnet launch, PI’s price experienced significant volatility. Within the first hour of trading, the token surged 41%, reaching a high of $2.10, according to CoinGecko data . The slight price surge preceded market fluctuations, which began due to market speculations on social media and FUD, causing the coin to drop to $1.3. At press time, Pi Coin was trading at $0.90 on OKX and most exchanges, a huge contrast from speculative IOU prices of $55 to $70 that market trackers had cited in the build-up to the launch. Pi network enthusiasts predict the token will reach $300 by next August, and a notable rally will begin when the project’s developers launch the functionality of DApps.

On Thursday, February 20, Metaplanet disclosed that it now held 2,100 BTC or about 0.01% of the total Bitcoin supply. The feat follows the firm's latest purchase of 68.59 BTC for approximately $6.6 million at an average price of $96,335 per Bitcoin.With the milestone, the firm is now closer to reclaiming a spot among the top 15 corporate holders of Bitcoin, only 42 BTC behind Cipher Mining, according to BitBO data .Interestingly, Metaplanet's share price jumped 2.78% to ¥6,290 or about $42 on the news.Recall that at the end of January 2025, Metaplanet stated that it intended to accumulate 10,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2025 and 21,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2026.To achieve this, the firm announced a ""21 Million Plan,"" which will see it issue 21 million shares of 0% discount moving warrants to raise approximately $745 million. At the time, the firm asserted that the plan would constitute the largest-ever capital raise to purchase Bitcoin in Asian equity markets.On Thursday, Metaplanet Director of Bitcoin Strategy Dylan LeClair disclosed that the firm had already raised approximately $20 million in the first two days of launching this 21 Million Plan.https://twitter.com/DylanLeClair_/status/1892415809856696381Since kicking off its Bitcoin strategy in April 2024, Metaplanet's stock price has surged over 3,000%, the best-performing stock in Japan within the period.The growth comes as the firm's Bitcoin strategy appears to be yielding results for shareholders, further driving up demand. In Q1 2024, it posted a BTC yield of 309.8% and is already posting a yield of 18% year-to-date (YTD).The BTC yield is a concept coined by Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy used to gauge the effectiveness of a Bitcoin treasury strategy. It refers to the percentage change in Bitcoin held by the firm relative to its total number of shares. “Our mission is to maximize Bitcoin per share for our shareholders. Bitcoin is not just an asset; it’s the exit strategy. We’re here to accumulate and lead, not sell,” Metaplanet's Dylan LeClair asserted in January 2025.",Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-02-20 16:06:01

While PEPE has been in existence for quite some time and has many dedicated followers, CHOW is equally growing popular and has endless possibilities for development. The crypto community has been attracted to these meme coins, but the question is, which one of them is better for establishing long-term value? ChowWow is on its way to becoming the best cryptocurrency in the market by making transactions cheaper and more efficient. This project is still in the presale stage and is available for a very low price of $0.008. One advantage of the ChowWow presale is that it gives both old and new investors a chance to join without facing any issues. This article examines whether ChowWow has the potential to outperform PEPE in building long-term value. Pepe Coin (PEPE): Struggling with Key Loss, but Long-Term Potential Remains Pepe Coin is one of the leading altcoins, and its source of inspiration comes from the famous PEPE Frog internet meme. The project is currently down 44% this month and has fallen below the $5 billion market cap level for the first time since November. The most critical issue for Pepe at the moment is the loss of $0.0001, which is a psychological and technical key level. Not only did Pepe lose this level, but it also decreased further. Crypto Knight, a famous trader, thinks that Pepe might be ready for a short-term dip and could test the lower boundary of the range before it continues its rally. Though Pepe's short-term prospects are rather unclear, analysts are more optimistic about its long-term potential. ChowWow ($CHOW): A Fast, Cost-Effective Crypto with Gaming Rewards ChowWow is a new crypto that offers real utility and long-term growth. Founded on the Solana blockchain network, it enjoys higher transactions and lower costs than meme coins developed on the Ethereum Blockchain. This makes ChowWow one of the most suitable top meme coins for investors who want efficiency and scalability. The ChowWow gaming kingdom also has several incentives associated with possessing the $CHOW token, making it rewarding. Users can earn play-to-earn rewards and enjoy using $CHOW tokens to buy some in-app purchases, such as boosts for pets. A portion of the in-game sales returns to the rewards pool, ensuring continuous engagement and value. ChowWow ($CHOW): Staking Rewards and Community Growth ChowWow enhances its ecosystem with a stake-to-earn model, encouraging users to hold and contribute positively to the platform's development. Staking $CHOW gives an 8% to 15% percentage yield annually, and the rewards are paid monthly. This also increases liquidity while offering long-term value to investors. In addition to its staking and gaming features, this new crypto is invested in building community and partnerships. This project will attain a wider market reach and attract more users through partnerships with influencers, global brands and blockchain projects. Having active social media accounts, meme competitions, and efficient governance tools strengthens its position as one of the top meme coins in the crypto space. Conclusion While PEPE might have positioned itself as a leading meme coin, ChowWow has much better tools for creating long-term value with its stake-to-earn system and other key functions. ChowWow has prioritized the concept of utility, incentives, and partnerships, which lays great ground for development. If you are searching for the best cryptocurrency with lasting impact, you should consider ChowWow.

Graham Darby, 50, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for contempt of court but was released after serving 146 days and apologizing, according to Wales Online. The case stemmed from a failed cryptocurrency transaction between Darby and Zi Wang, a 22-year-old Australian trader. The two had agreed to swap 30 Bitcoin ( BTC ) for 400,000 Tezos ( XTZ ), with plans to reverse the trade after two years. However, Wang claimed Darby failed to return the Tezos as agreed, resulting in losses of between £900,000 ($1.14 million) and £1.3 million. Wang alleged that after Tezos’s value increased, Darby blocked him on Telegram and refused to uphold the agreement. Darby denied wrongdoing, saying Wang had simply “done less well out of the transaction.” When the case reached the High Court, Darby failed to disclose that he still controlled 100 Bitcoin—worth around £8 million. Cybercrime investigator Richard Sanders provided expert testimony, uncovering Darby’s extensive network of digital wallets. Darby denied ownership, claiming he had forgotten his wallet passwords. However, Sanders’ findings convinced the court otherwise. Darby missed a key hearing, leading Judge Keyser KC to rule against him. He later attended another hearing, stating he had struggled to secure legal representation. The judge found that Darby had “put his head in the sand” and sentenced him to 18 months, with the possibility of early release if he apologized.

His daughter helped him secure legal aid, and he ultimately admitted contempt, apologized, and settled with Wang. Lord Justice James Dingemans, who reviewed the appeal, acknowledged Darby’s mental health struggles and legal difficulties. He ruled that Darby had complied with court orders and reduced his sentence to time served. Following his release, Darby compared his experience to the UK’s Post Office scandal, saying, “The system is broken.” His case highlights the legal complexities surrounding cryptocurrency disputes and the importance of full financial disclosure in court.

He answered “of course,” especially when others question why Ethereum has not been more open to applications with blockchain gambling, seemingly taking a jab at its competitor, Solana, and how their ecosystem has embraced a lot of memecoin activity over the past year. Buterin’s comment comes as the Ethereum community has faced backlash from members raising the alarm that the chain will lose its competitive advantage to rivals if it doesn’t address some core issues, while Solana has attracted more new developers than Ethereum and has poached top talent . Buterin also said that if the community continues on with this “moral reversal,” he would no longer participate in the Ethereum ecosystem. “But I found an interesting point: on the internet, many people will say those things, but when I chat with the community in person, everyone’s values are the same as before, so I feel like I have a responsibility to this community and can’t abandon them,” Buterin added.

The stagnancy that has suppressed XRP throughout February has erupted into action, with the price surging 9.16% over the past 7 days. While the early week saw this momentum falter, sending XRP below $2.50, a second wave has since recovered much of the dip. With today’s 5.11% gain, backed by an 11% uptick in trading volume to $5.5 billion, XRP could be poised for a major breakout ahead. Analyst’s Projection Plays Out: Here’s What Happens Next This price action aligns with analyst TehThomas’ projection shared on the TradingView platform. XRP / USDT 4H chart, descending resistance trendline. Source: TehThomas / TradingView. They initially identified $2.50 as a key Fair Value Gap (FVG)—a significant liquidity zone where XRP could establish support before continuing its uptrend. Throughout this cycle, the FVG has served as an imbalance area, often sparking reactions as traders step in to fill the gap. Following a decisive rebound from this level, TehThomas believes XRP’s next critical step is to break above a descending resistance trendline. XRP Price Analysis: How High Can XRP Go? While TehThomas sets a breakout target of $3, the resistance trendline is part of a symmetrical triangle pattern forming since the new year. XRP / USDT 4H chart, symmetrical triangle pattern. Source: TradingView. While an initial attempt to break the trendline was rejected, the XRP price remains on strong footing for a reattempt. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) holds steady at 57, while the MACD recently confirmed a golden cross, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line. Such moves often precede significant price upticks, with the bulls firmly in control of the asset’s next move. If a decisive breakout occurs, the triangle pattern sets a target of $4, marking a potential 50% gain from current levels. However, the analyst notes that retesting the upper barrier as support post-breakout will be key to confirming sustained upward momentum. This ICO Allows You to Make the Best of This Bull Cycle Any trader hedging their risk likely features Bitcoin (BTC) as a major part of their portfolio. While the leading cryptocurrency provides stable gains, it often sacrifices upside potential—that’s where Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL) comes in, offering a fresh way to capitalize on BTC tailwinds. True to its name, Bitcoin Bull ties its tokenomics to Bitcoin’s price growth in a deflationary model. The project burns tokens and distributes BTC airdrops whenever Bitcoin reaches key milestones—starting at $125,000 and triggering new rewards for every $25,000 climb thereafter. With some analysts forecasting BTC highs of $250,000 this cycle, BTCBULL could become a Bitcoin Maxi’s best friend. With almost $2.5 million raised in its initial two weeks, the project is already gaining strong momentum—potentially credited to its 175% APY on staking that rewards early investors.

Moscow framed Washington as an imperialist force trying to dominate the global order, and Washington, in turn, took every opportunity to paint Russia as a collapsing power. US sanctions crippled Russia’s economy, cutting off trade, blocking financial access, and punishing key sectors. But suddenly, everything is changing. With President Donald Trump back in the White House and the first real Russia-US talks since early 2022, the Kremlin is making a complete U-turn. After years of hostility, Vladimir Putin is dropping the adversarial stance and engaging in negotiations. This, of course, comes as Trump publicly clashed with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, calling him a “dictator” on Wednesday. Just hours later, Putin broke his silence, confirming that Moscow is now seriously engaging with Washington. Russia reopens negotiations as Trump and Zelenskyy clash Russia and the US met in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday, the first formal sit-down between officials since the start of the Ukraine war. The meeting, which took place without Ukraine’s involvement, was framed as a step toward ending the conflict. Kremlin officials immediately responded positively, and Putin told the media on Wednesday that: “I rate [the negotiations in Saudi Arabia] highly, there is a result. In general, as I was told, it [the mood] was very friendly. On the American side, there were entirely different people who were open to the negotiation process without any bias, without any prejudice to what was done in the past.” Putin then praised Trump’s “restraint”, accusing European leaders of hysteria over being excluded from the discussions. Just yesterday, Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the talks were not just about Ukraine but about reviving US-Russia relations as a whole. While Ukraine was left out, China was paying close attention. A peace deal in Ukraine would move America’s military focus entirely to Beijing—something that President Xi Jinping is trying so hard to avoid. China braces for impact as US changes focus Beijing has kept its distance from the Trump administration, avoiding direct confrontation while dealing with a crippling property crisis, weak economic growth, and US trade tariffs. The last thing China wants is full-scale American military attention. While China publicly welcomed the US-Russia talks, Beijing is preparing for what comes next. Trump’s team has made it clear that once Ukraine is out of the way, Washington will turn its focus to countering China. Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth and Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., have both made it clear that China is the next target. Unlike during Trump’s first term, Xi is playing it safe. Beijing avoided an aggressive response to Trump’s 10% tariffs, taking a more cautious approach. Xi even met with Alibaba’s Jack Ma this week, signaling an end to China’s tech crackdown as Beijing tries to stabilize the economy. Trump himself has also toned down his rhetoric on China, saying on Wednesday that a trade deal was “possible” and reaffirming his “very good relationship” with Xi. However, his administration is stacked with China hawks, including Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, both of whom have pledged to confront Beijing’s influence in the South China Sea. For China, the worst-case scenario is a NATO-style coalition in the Pacific. Under Biden, the US strengthened military ties with Japan and South Korea. Russia’s economy looks to recover as sanctions ease For Moscow, the biggest incentive for peace talks isn’t just diplomacy—it’s the economy. Russia has spent the last three years pouring money into war production, shifting workers to military factories, and dealing with rising inflation. The Kremlin has publicly downplayed sanctions, but the numbers tell a different story. Russia’s GDP grew by 3.8% in 2024, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But that number is set to plummet to 1.4% in 2025 as private consumption and investment decline. Even Putin himself admitted the economy was “overheating,” predicting a 2-2.5% growth rate next year. A peace deal could open the door for a partial lifting of sanctions, giving Russia access to Western financial systems and international markets again. Moscow has relied on China and India to keep its economy afloat, but the ability to export to the US and Europe again would be a massive boost. According to Liam Peach, a senior economist at Capital Economics, the talks could bring a major shift in global energy markets. “The decision by the US and Russia to ‘lay the groundwork’ to end the war in Ukraine marks a potentially significant turning point after three years of conflict,” Peach said in a note on Tuesday. He added that a peace deal could result in higher Russian natural gas exports and lower global energy prices. However, he also noted that any economic benefit to Europe—outside of Russia and Ukraine—would likely be limited. Even if sanctions aren’t lifted entirely, the potential for a partial rollback is already changing Russia’s economic outlook. Moscow could regain access to the US financial system and increase energy exports to Europe, easing economic pressure.

Our top picks—Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Ripple (XRP)—are all seeing major developments in their ecosystems. A Layer-2 Project That Could Make Bitcoin Faster and Cheaper PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is another project that might be worth watching. It’s designed to potentially speed up Bitcoin transactions, cut fees, and make BTC more practical for everyday use. Let’s take a closer look! PlutoChain ($PLUTO): The Hybrid Layer-2 Solution That Could Unlock Bitcoin’s Full Potential for Everyday Use Bitcoin is the most recognized cryptocurrency, but it’s far from perfect. Slow transactions and high fees make it inconvenient for everyday payments. With block confirmations taking around 10 minutes, Bitcoin struggles to compete with modern payment systems. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is a hybrid Layer-2 solution that runs on its own high-speed network and brings block times of just two seconds. This means instant BTC payments without long wait times, which could make Bitcoin more practical for daily use. Another big benefit is lower fees. Bitcoin’s transaction costs can be high, especially for small transfers, which makes microtransactions almost impossible. PlutoChain could slash fees and allow users to send BTC without the worry of excessive costs. But, PlutoChain isn’t just about payments. With Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility , it might support DeFi applications, NFTs, and AI-powered blockchain tools. This could expand Bitcoin’s use beyond just a store of value and make way for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on its network. PlutoChain’s testnet has already proven its scalability by handling over 43,200 transactions in a single day. To ensure security, it has undergone audits from SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi . With decentralized governance, users can propose and vote on upgrades, which keeps the network community-driven and adaptable. By making Bitcoin faster, cheaper, and more functional, PlutoChain could be a key driver to bringing Bitcoin into mainstream adoption. Cardano (ADA): Advancing Smart Contracts and Strengthening Blockchain Scalability ADA’s price recently surged and a major reason for this is growing institutional interest and speculation about a potential Cardano Spot ETF. Analysts estimate a 60% chance of SEC approval by March 2025, which would be a game-changer for ADA. Despite the excitement, ADA has struggled to stay above $0.80. Its RSI sits at 44, suggesting it’s nearing oversold territory. Crypto analyst Tyler Burke remains bullish and says ADA could follow past bull cycles and hit $5–$7 by spring. Meanwhile, the Plomin hard fork was rolled out to improve governance and decentralization. While this upgrade strengthens Cardano’s ecosystem, it hasn’t yet led to a price surge. Ethereum (ETH): Scaling Innovations and Rising Institutional Adoption Ethereum has been advancing in both adoption and network improvements. Recently, a major whale withdrew 7,347 ETH (around $19.95 million) from Binance. On the development front, Ethereum’s ecosystem is evolving with a strong focus on scalability and user experience. Developers are working on improvements that will make transactions smoother and more cost-effective. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined a long-term vision focusing on decentralization and better support for light clients in a rollup-heavy ecosystem. Crypto analyst Ted believes Ethereum is set for a short-term rally to $3.1K–$3.3K as traders shift focus from meme coins back to utility tokens, followed by potential consolidation before another upward move. Solana (SOL): Fast Transactions and Steady DeFi Growth Solana has been getting attention but with a share of controversy. Some analysts believe its ecosystem has been tainted by scams, which led to a shift in sentiment. Meanwhile, an upcoming token unlock in March has some traders worried about potential selling pressure. But despite these hurdles, institutional investors are betting big on Solana. Major financial players like Bitwise, VanEck, and 21Shares are filing for Solana-based ETFs. Despite the negative market sentiment The Cryptomist , an analyst on X, is optimistic and says that SOL is forming an ascending triangle pattern and could break out to $250. Ripple (XRP): Expanding Global Payments and Strengthening Institutional Adoption Ripple (XRP) is at the center of major developments. The SEC recently acknowledged Grayscale’s application for an XRP-based ETF and while this isn’t an approval, it’s a step in the right direction for XRP’s legitimacy in traditional finance. Meanwhile, the SEC is set to hold a closed meeting on February 20, which could influence ongoing cases, including Ripple’s legal battle. XRP is currently trading at around $2.68, up 2.6% in the last 24 hours. Its market cap sits at approximately $154.98 billion. Armando Pantoja says XRP’s price could reach between $8 and $25 by 2025–2026. The Verdict While Solana, Ethereum, Cardano, and Ripple keep evolving, it might be a good idea to pay attention to them. However, PlutoChain could generate substantial buzz with a hybrid Layer-2 solution that could tackle Bitcoin’s biggest issues—slow transactions and high fees—while adding smart contract capabilities. —- Please keep in mind that this article is not financial advice.

Although marginal (only 3% over the last 24 hours), this increase has been the result of constant updates, as well as the recent bi-weekly digest from the Cardano community. Hey Cardano Community, The bi-weekly Community Digest has just been released. This edition covers: @buidler_fest #2 confirmed for Da Nang, Vietnam @amw7 breaks down the treasury tax rate proposal @IntersectMBO draft budget proposals now open for community feedback… pic.twitter.com/0fg1VCLVa9 — Cardano Community (@Cardano) February 17, 2025 Since the market is still gasping under the grips of volatility, investors are better off picking other altcoins that could provide even higher gains. Cardano Price Jumps 3% Since Yesterday Latest chart shows that Cardano price has surged by a minor 3% since the last 24 hours. Currently trading around the $0.78 level, the altcoin’s current market cap is higher than $27 billion. However, there has been a double-digit decline in the crypto’s trading volume, which could indicate significant hope for ADA to jump higher. Source: TradingView This may not come to pass, however, as the ADA price ‘s recent two green candles are not long. And to retest 2024’s highs, Cardano has to move up by at least 75%. Considering Cardano is a high-cap token, expecting this level of parabolic price action is unwise. 3 Cryptos To Capitalize On Cardano Price’s Latest Surge Snek (SNEK) While Cardano price surges, Snek is the OG meme coin on the Cardano blockchain. Known for its unique snake-based themes, it is the largest token on the Cardano ecosystem in trading volume due to its status as a meme coin. Source: CoinMarketCap While it presents a meme-centric project, Snek has created a large ecosystem with multiple products. There is Snek.fun, which is a token launchpad; with SNEKx, users get a token minter; SNEKbot gives users a telegram trading bot; SNEKalerts is an alert bot on X; and Kaa is a Snek-based AI infrastructure platform. Due to the virtual appeal of its mascot, Snek has also ventured into the energy-drink industry through the Snek Energy drink. Although this bouquet of use cases is big, Snek has made more of an impression on people through its memes. Since its launch in early 2023, it has moved up by more than 60,000%. The token’s recent price action, however, has been less than optimal, considering it has dipped by more than 17% since last month. That being said, Snek has a habit of bouncing back and doing it in a big way, which means the current intraday lows present a good “buying the dip” opportunity for SNEK. BTC BULL (BTCBULL) Cathie Wood of ARK Invest and Samson Mow of JAN3 are a few of the experts that firmly believe that the day will come when Bitcoin will become a million dollar asset. BTC Bull is a meme coin project that has formed an entire community around it. Source: BTC BULL The meme coin not only follows sort-of similar tokenomics as Bitcoin, with its total supply of 21 billion mirroring Bitcoin’s supply of 21 million, it has set milestones that will allow investors to capitalize on the upcoming bull cycle. This comes from BTC Bull’s milestones, which revolve around burning the tokens and organizing BTC giveaways every time the world’s biggest crypto jumps by $25K. And when Bitcoin reaches the $250K mark, BTC Bull will organize a BTCBULL token giveaway. While Cardano price remains bullish, BTC Bull can gain from the current positive sentiment around Bitcoin, and the way milestones have been designed will incentivize winners of the BTC airdrop to keep hold of their Bitcoins to capitalize on the bull market. Available on presale and raising over $2.4 million to date, the BTC Bull token can be bought at a discount price of just $0.00237. If the project goes live during the bull market, a 10x, or even a 100x jump is a possibility for this token. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink is a utility crypto and the second-biggest Cardano ecosystem token. Currently trading around the $18 level, Chainlink has a market cap of over $11.55 billion. This crypto has also seen a reduction in trading volume by 31%, indicating investors’ interest in keeping hold of their assets. Source: CoinMarketCap Following the tracks of Cardano price, in the last 24 hours, there has been an uptick in the LINK price of a minor 1%. This pump could have been the result of SiloFinance and MONAD adopting Chainlink’s standard, and the addition of a multi-model AI strategy to remove AI hallucinations and make the usage of artificial intelligence more optimal for the finance sector. As the Cardano price increases, Chainlink may be the first swept up by that bullish momentum to move up in value. However, because the ecosystem is focused so much on utility, the gain won’t be parabolic. Conclusion Cardano price surged 3% to $0.78, sparking interest in altcoins like Snek, BTC Bull, and Chainlink. While Cardano faces resistance, these altcoins present unique opportunities. With innovative ecosystems and bullish sentiment, they could deliver significant returns if the market momentum continues, offering investors new ways to capitalize on crypto gains.

But many traders believe its best days may be over. With SOL already near its peak, investors are now looking for the next big opportunity. One Solana rival, DTX Exchange, is gaining massive attention as it prepares for launch. After selling out its presale, DTX Exchange has entered the bonus stage, giving buyers a final chance to grab tokens at $0.18 before listing. With huge demand and limited supply, early buyers could see massive gains in March. Solana’s Meme Hype Won’t Make You Rich—Here’s What Will Solana's price has seen impressive gains, surging over 1,200% in the last year. With SOL becoming a popular choice for speculative traders, much of the recent rally has been fueled by a surge in hype-driven projects. However, Solana's price is now facing some serious challenges. Despite the excitement, SOL has struggled to get back to its ATH of $259.96 that it achieved in November 2021, leaving many traders wondering whether it can continue its upward momentum. The market seems to be asking whether Solana's price has already reached its peak or if it’s time to explore new opportunities. Source: CoinMarketCap The rise of Solana prices over the past year has largely been driven by speculative trading, with many jumping in on the meme coin trend. But now, with SOL facing network congestion and slower transaction speeds, the hype surrounding Solana's price may not be enough to push it higher. As more traders become frustrated with the delays and high gas fees, many are starting to rethink their positions. Solana's price has proven its potential, but it’s unclear whether it can continue to rise in the face of these growing pains. That’s where DTX Exchange comes in. As a Solana rival, DTX Exchange offers a next-level trading platform built for serious investors, not just meme-driven hype. Unlike Solana price, which is facing congestion and network delays, DTX Exchange has a high-performance infrastructure designed to handle massive trade volumes without slowing down. This advanced technology is attracting serious traders who value speed and reliability. DTX Exchange is in its final presale stage at just $0.18, and experts are predicting it could surge by 10,000% in March as interest in DTX grows. The platform has features that could make it a top competitor to Solana, with an advanced trading system and plenty of liquidity. DTX Exchange Could See a 10,000% Gain in March DTX Exchange is not just another crypto platform, it's designed to change the game. It's already been audited by SolidProof, ensuring your investment is safe from hacks and fraud. In an industry with plenty of security issues, DTX offers strong protection, using multi-signature wallets and encrypted transactions to keep traders secure. The platform is made with traders in mind. Unlike some Solana-based exchanges that struggle with liquidity during busy trading times, DTX is preparing to have one of the largest liquidity pools. This means fast transactions with no delays, which is critical for traders who need quick execution. While SOL faces slowdowns, DTX is positioning itself as the platform for smooth, high-volume trading. What sets DTX apart even further is its fair launch model. Unlike many projects that are dominated by venture capitalists, DTX ensures equal opportunities for every investor during its presale. Early adopters have already seen incredible rewards, with tokens priced at just $0.18 before the listing. This offers a huge upside potential for those who get in early, DTX could see a 10,000% gain by March as demand for its innovative features continues to soar. When comparing DTX Exchange to Solana (SOL), the differences are clear. While Solana's price has struggled to maintain momentum despite its previous surge, DTX Exchange is gaining real traction with a strong roadmap for growth. SOL’s past successes have been overshadowed by recent challenges, but DTX has already raised over $14 million, creating massive momentum in the lead-up to its public launch. DTX Exchange could be the next big thing, rivaling Solana and delivering significant returns in March, an opportunity you won’t want to miss.

With key developments surrounding ETH and its ecosystem, many analysts foresee a move to unprecedented levels in the upcoming months. Current Cycle’s Target For Ethereum Above $10,000 Ethereum may have been demonstrating weak performances in the ongoing cycle as it failed to initiate a major rally. However, market expert and investor Ted Pillows has expressed his confidence in ETH’s long-term prospects, predicting a new all-time high target for the altcoin. Pillows predicted that ETH will reach $10,000, stating it is a conservative target this cycle. Addressing the reasons why the $10,000 target and beyond is conservative, the expert highlighted that Ethereum is currently the optimal layer for organizations like central banks, credit unions, insurers, and government-affiliated companies. Also, adoption is increasing worldwide, and the United States pro-crypto position acts as a major driving force for Ethereum. “With plans to bring the US Treasury on-chain, ETH is positioned for a strong comeback and widespread use,” Pillows added. Following a comparison with past trends, Ted Pillows claims that “Ethereum is destined to go above $10,000 this current cycle.” The analyst cites a similar trend between the 2016 cycle and this cycle, whereby ETH witnessed a breakout to new all-time highs. Should the development repeat itself, Pillows foresees a substantial move in the coming months, reaching between the $10,000 and $11,000 price range. His prediction indicates that ETH’s fundamentals continue to remain strong in light of recent market fluctuations, marking the $10,000 not just possible, but predestined. Several bullish factors around Ethereum back pillows’ bold forecast. For example, ETH has the highest Total Value Locked (TVL) and stablecoin liquidity. Furthermore, the altcoin is experiencing heightened adoption and accumulation by institutional investors . Ethereum’s inflation is presently lower than that of Bitcoin and 99% of all altcoins. As a result of these advancements, the expert urges investors and traders to focus on a rally for ETH to $10,000 rather than a rally to $5,000 this market cycle. ETH Set For A Notable Price Recovery? Following a significant underperformance in 2024 in comparison to other large caps, there has been some expectation of a recovery for ETH. On-chain platform Santiment reported that the altcoin recently displayed mild signs of a rebound as its price moved to $2,745, outperforming most altcoins to begin the week. According to Santiment, ETH keeps leaving exchanges and entering cold wallets at a remarkable pace from a long-term perspective. Currently, the percentage of available ETH in exchanges is at 6.38%, marking its lowest level ever. This persistent withdrawal reflects investors’ confidence in Ethereum’s long-term performance, which might trigger a rebound.",Ethereum|altcoins|bitcoin|Central Banks|Credit Unions|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum ecosystem|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Government-Affliated Companies|Santiment|Stablecoin Liquidity|Ted Pillows|Total Value Locked|TVL|US Treasury,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-20 17:30:59

Meet DTX Exchange,https://bitzo.com/2025/02/can-a-new-player-in-crypto-overshadow-solana-meet-dtx-exchange,"In the competitive world of cryptocurrencies, Solana has etched its mark by skyrocketing over 1,200% in a year. However, as its ascent appears to approach a plateau, investors with a nose for potential are scouting for fresher opportunities. Enter DTX Exchange, a budding rival preparing to redefine trading experiences. After a successful presale, where tokens were snapped up rapidly, DTX is now in a crucial bonus phase. Here, tokens are available for $0.18, positioning early backers to possibly realize substantial returns as March unfolds. Solana’s Hype and the Quest for Authentic Value While Solana's impressive climb to over 1,200% showcases its allure for speculative enthusiasts, there's speculation on whether its zenith has been reached. The once-glorious $259.96 mark from November 2021 seems elusive, prompting questions about its future growth potential. Although Solana thrived on meme-driven excitement, recent challenges such as network congestion and escalating transaction fees are causing some traders to reconsider their loyalties. Source: CoinMarketCap With the charm of meme coins showing signs of waning, Solana's allure faces scrutiny. The price, once propelled by speculative trading, now grapples with the real-world issues of network slowdowns and costly gas fees. Amidst this backdrop, the conversation shifts to alternatives that combine promise with performance. Why DTX Exchange Might Be the Game Changer DTX Exchange is emerging as more than just another cryptocurrency platform; it's a harbinger of innovation. With a nod from SolidProof, this venture underscores its commitment to security through multi-signature wallets and encrypted transactions, mitigating common industry risks. DTX Exchange’s infrastructure sets it apart with a capability to manage immense trade volumes efficiently, crucial for investors prioritizing speed and dependability. With plans for a vast liquidity pool, it sidesteps issues seen in other exchanges during peak trading periods. DTX’s fair launch model ensures an equitable playing field, offering investors a slice of a potentially prosperous future. Differentiating itself further from Solana, DTX has managed to garner significant investor interest, amassing over $14 million. This positions DTX Exchange as a rising star, eager to take advantage of Solana's recent setbacks. For those looking for the next big opportunity, DTX could be the promising candidate, setting the stage for a remarkable rise in March.

On one side, Ethereum's price movements captivate stakeholders with its technical improvements and increasing institutional embrace. Across the aisle, Ripple's XRP navigates through a labyrinth of regulatory scrutiny, steadily gaining traction. Amidst these powerhouses, an emerging AI-based altcoin is forging a new path, grabbing investor attention for its potential disruptive impact. The Road Ahead for Ethereum: Institutional Allies and Network Evolution As Ethereum marches towards groundbreaking upgrades, its relevance in the financial sector grows. Recently priced at $2,690, Ethereum navigates a challenging landscape defined by a descending price trend, braced by support levels around $2,600. Furthermore, Ethereum's influence could expand through its anticipated Pectra mainnet launch, expected to redefine its operational capabilities. Acknowledging this, the financial giants like Goldman Sachs are strategically positioning themselves, eyeing Ethereum's potential with a $1.5 billion stake. Source: CoinMarketCap Coupled with the possibility of incorporating Ethereum staking into ETFs, this digital currency's forward momentum could see its price test the waters beyond the $2,800 barrier, aiming higher at $3,000 in the coming years. Ripple's Ripple Effect: Navigating Through Regulatory Waters Ripple's XRP is gathering momentum, driven by favorable regulatory discussions and technological upgrades on its ledger. The recent NFTokenmintOffer upgrade enhances its NFT capabilities, while potential XRP-ETFs buoy investor sentiments. Market observers have noted XRP's current trading fluctuations, with predictions suggesting robust growth. A keen eye is on the formation of bullish signals like the golden cross, which could propel XRP to new highs by mid-2025. Source: CoinMarketCap With Ripple fortifying its standing in decentralized finance and cross-border payment solutions, XRP is poised for potential breakthroughs, possibly reaching prices as high as $5.80, securing its influence further in the financial ecosystem.

However, one growing AI altcoin is gaining traction as a possible market disruptor. With advanced AI-driven trading tools and cross-chain capabilities, this innovative project has already raised over $10.5 million in its ongoing ICO. As competition intensifies, analysts debate which of these three assets will hit new highs first in 2025. Ethereum Price Faces Crucial Resistance as Institutional Adoption Grows The Ethereum price trends positively as the network moves towards significant upgrades and growing institutional adoption. With a price tag of $2,690, the Ethereum price has been on a bearish channel since December, with $2,600 offering support. Source: CoinMarketCap Ethereum staking is gaining momentum as the NYSE considers integrating it into Grayscale's ETF. Cboe BZX is seeking SEC approval for a similar ETF offering staking rewards. Goldman Sachs' $1.5 billion ETH position further solidifies the Ethereum price growth potential. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s Pectra mainnet launch, scheduled for April 8, could bring significant enhancements, extending Fusaka EIP proposals and influencing future scalability. As institutional confidence builds and network upgrades take shape, the Ethereum price could see a breakout that defines its 2025 trajectory. Analysts believe that if the Ethereum price breaks past the $2,800 resistance, the next key level to watch will be $3,000. XRP Price Gains Momentum Amid Ripple’s Regulatory Optimism XRP Ledger's NFTokenmintOffer upgrade enables the minting and selling of NFTs in one trade. Meanwhile, talks at the SEC about possible XRP-ETFs are giving Ripple more momentum. This has prompted speculation that XRP could soon become recognized as a commodity, placing Ripple on the crypto map even more firmly. Source: CoinMarketCap XRP dropped to $2.60 during the last twenty-four hours, and trading volume grew to $4.12 billion. However, analysts remain upbeat about the fact that Ripple will survive. Some forecasts say the XRP could hit an all-time high before July 2025. A golden cross pattern forming when the 50-day SMA crosses the 200-day SMA has historically been a bullish signal for XRP's momentum. Ripple's rising adoption and favorable regulatory moves put XRP in a position to break out. If the current trajectory holds, some analysts see XRP reaching $5.80, up from its $3.84 ATH. The continued growth of Ripple in DeFi and cross-border payments also fuels speculation that the crypto giant will expand its reach in the financial world, further fueling XRP's upcoming rally.

40595792,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=678960,1740073237,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40595792.jpeg,Zelenskyy blocks Trump’s Truth Social network across Ukraine,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/zelensky-blocks-trumps-truth-social-ukraine/,"Multiple reports on social media say US President Donald Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, has been shut down in Ukraine. The app’s countrywide block comes on the backdrop of Trump calling Ukrainian President Zelenskyy a “dictator without elections.” Through a Truth Social post on Wednesday, Donald Trump took a few digs at Zelenskyy, accusing him of “mismanaging” the war with Russia. The latter then fired back at Trump in a news interview with reporters, saying he was falling for Russian “disinformation.” This made the White House more frustrated, and the POTUS did not hold back during his speech at a Saudi-backed investment event in Florida, where he criticized Ukraine for using billions of dollars from American aid programs to fight in a “war that couldn’t be won.” In what seems to be a retaliation, Zelenskyy and his officials have reportedly blocked access to Trump’s Truth Social platform within Ukraine. Trump and Zelenskyy: A word for word battle Speaking at the Florida event, Trump claimed Zelenskyy had manipulated US President Joe Biden to help him fight in an unnecessary war for years. “The only thing Zelenskyy was really good at was playing Joe Biden like a fiddle,” the US CIC told the audience. He accused the Ukrainian leader of failing to hold elections after prematurely imposing martial law despite his term officially ending in May 2024. Under martial law, Ukraine suspended elections due to Russia’s ongoing invasion, which the Trump administration insists is an undemocratic move. “ He refuses to have elections. He’s low in the real Ukrainian polls. How can you be high when every city is being demolished? ” During his interview yesterday, Zelenskyy dismissed Trump’s accusations, saying the US leader was operating in a “disinformation space” shaped by Moscow. “We are seeing a lot of disinformation, especially the 4% opinion poll, and it’s coming from Russia,” Zelenskyy said in Kyiv on Wednesday. “With all due respect to President Donald Trump as a leader… he is living in this disinformation space.” Zelenskyy argued that US-Russia negotiations, from which Ukraine and the EU are supposedly excluded, are somewhat legitimizing Russia’s invasion of his country. He also accused America of helping Russian President Vladimir Putin “break out of years of isolation.” President Trump unbothered by critics Some European leaders are of the opinion that Trump went too far by calling Zelenskyy a dictator. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called his statements “absurd,” saying Trump was distorting the reality of dictatorship. “ If you look at the real world instead of just firing off a tweet, then you know who in Europe has to live in the conditions of a dictatorship: people in Russia, people in Belarus, ” she told German broadcaster ZDF. Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk also denounced the US President’s sentiments, telling the BBC that Russia was “popping champagne” in celebration because he supports their cause. “Volodymyr Zelenskyy is a completely legitimate president,” Yatsenyuk said. “We cannot hold elections under martial law.” At a news conference in Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, he blamed Ukraine for the war, implying that Kyiv could have avoided conflict by negotiating earlier. “You should have never started it. You could have made a deal,” he said. “ I hear that they’re upset about not having a seat. Well, they’ve had a seat for three years and a long time before that. This could have been settled very easily. “ Trump and his allies vehemently believe that securing a settlement to end the war is long overdue after years of prolonged conflict. However, the president has yet to provide a deeper scope about the terms of such a deal. “ I don’t care so much about anything other than I want to stop having millions of people killed .” GOP leaders, like Trump’s second in command JD Vance, suggested Zelensky miscalculated his prowess by publicly criticizing Trump. “ The idea that Zelensky is going to change the president’s mind by badmouthing him in public media… Everyone who knows the president will tell you that is an atrocious way to deal with this administration ,” Vance told The Daily Mail.

According to inside information shared by Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, the SEC is showing keen interest in staking mechanisms, even requesting industry memos detailing different staking models and their benefits. “According to a source who recently spoke with the SEC, the agency is ‘very, very interested’ in staking, even asking the industry for a memo detailing the different types of staking and their benefits,” Terrett said. “The source expects to see some sort of guidance on staking from the agency in the near future, as it is something they are enthusiastically working on.” Related News: JUST IN: Coinbase Announces It Will List A New Altcoin - Binance Listed It Recently, It's Falling Despite Listing This development follows recent interactions between the SEC’s Division of Commerce and Markets and crypto industry stakeholders, including participation in a staking webinar last week, suggesting a potential shift in the regulator’s stance on staking and its role in investment products. In a notable move, the SEC has formally considered Cboe’s 19b-4 filing seeking approval for staking in the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF. If approved, this would allow the ETF to generate additional returns on Ethereum (ETH) assets via staking, with the potential for those returns to be passed on to investors. *This is not investment advice.

Now, crypto analyst Gem Hunter has provided a bullish outlook for the coin, suggesting that it could even surpass the XRP price after it gets listed on Binance. Pi Coin Could Surpass XRP Price After Binance Listing Gem Hunter recently suggested that the Pi coin price could surpass the XRP price after a potential Binance listing. In an X post , the analyst noted that Pi network’s chart doesn’t look bad at all and hinted that the current price was the bottom. The analyst further remarked that the Pi coin had recorded almost $1 billion trading volume in eight hours despite listing on only a few centralized exchanges (CEXs). Gem Hunter stated that the real fun will start when Binance and other top crypto exchanges list Pi. As such, he urged market participants to buy the dip and hold. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Pi coin price could rally to as high as $2.8 when Binance and these top exchanges potentially list the coin. A rally to this price level could put Pi above the XRP price, which is currently trading at around $2.6. It is worth mentioning that Binance is currently running a community poll on whether it should list Pi. Most community members have voted for the top crypto exchange to list the coin. As such, there is the possibility that Binance could list the crypto at some point, which would provide some bullish momentum for its price. The Pi network mainnet officially launched today. Consequently, the Pi coin also went live on several exchanges, including OKX, and reached an all-time high (ATH) of $2.2 before witnessing a price correction. XRP Price Could Surge Before Then Crypto analyst Dark Defender recently predicted that the XRP price could surge to $3 soon enough, a move which would see the crypto surpass the projected $2.8 level for Pi coin. According to the analyst, XRP will see a break towards $2.77 first and then towards $3 “within hours.” Meanwhile, in his analysis of XRP in the 12-hour time frame, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto noted that the coin has bounced off the low edge of the ascending triangle, showing bullish momentum. The analyst stated that targeting $2.83 is the next bullish milestone for XRP. Egrag Crypto further remarked that a bullish signal will occur when XRP closes above the $2.90 and $3.10 range with confirmation. He claimed this would turn this range into strong support for a bullish continuation and a major milestone from a structural perspective. The XRP price is already up today thanks to bullish fundamentals such as the SEC’s acknowledgment of the XRP ETFs and Hashdex’s XRP ETF, which is set to launch in Brazil.

This prolonged bearish pressure on the Ethereum price has made investors anxious, with some seeking a potential alternative that can easily recover losses. One standout project ETH whales are focusing on is the new trending altcoin called DTX Exchange (DTX). These whales predict that DTX could be among the top 20 altcoins in 2025. Therefore, investors and traders are massively interested, grabbing slots rapidly as the DTX presale is about to end. The presale's tremendous success indicates that this project has the potential to experience extraordinary growth in the cryptocurrency market. Ethereum Price Consolidation Extends As it Fails Breakout Ethereum (ETH) has faced continuous selling pressure over the past two months and is struggling to regain bullish momentum. Macroeconomic uncertainty and broader market weakness have impacted investor sentiment, and Ethereum price action reflects the same. From the peak of December, the Ethereum price has dropped approximately 35% and is currently trading at $2,665. Courtesy: TradingView After the sharp drop in early February, the Ethereum price reached a low of $2,160. After recovering to $2,800, it has been moving sideways between $2,570 and $2,800. On Monday, ETH faced rejection at the $2,850 resistance level, which coincided with the 20-period moving average. Daily timeframe analysis shows that the Ethereum price could reach a new high if it breaks the range. One factor dragging down the Ethereum price is the weak performance of its ETFs. Ethereum ETFs saw a net outflow of 1,151 ETH, amounting to a loss of $3.21 million. Grayscale's ETHE was the biggest contributor, with an outflow of 1,510 ETH ($4.22 million), bringing its total holdings down to 1,303,257 ETH. At press time, the Ethereum price is trading at $2,660, with little movement in the last 24 hours. The market capitalization is $321 billion, and the 24-hour trading volume is $25 billion. DTX Exchange Surges Amid Market Chaos While Ethereum price is struggling to regain previous levels, the demand in the DTX Exchange is continuously increasing. After commencing the 8th round successfully, the DTX presale has entered the bonus round, and over 375 million tokens have been sold. Experts believe this success signals the project’s potential to become the next big thing in the crypto market. The platform has been hailed as a one-stop solution for traders, meeting the needs of both beginners and experienced traders. It is the first crypto-native platform to offer 120,000+ assets in a single platform. Users can access currency pairs, forex, stocks, CFDs and ETFs, and a wide range of digital assets like crypto and NFTs. This approach helps traders manage multiple assets and eliminates the need for multiple platforms. Other notable features of the platform include 1,000x leverage, distributed liquidity pools, a non-custodial wallet, advanced chain analytics, and algorithmic and copy trading. All these facilities in one place provide traders with higher efficiency and speed. SolidProof has conducted a strict KYC check on DTX Exchange to ensure its safety. Additionally, to increase financial inclusion, DTX adopts a no-KYC policy that allows users from any background or region to join. Moreover, as an emerging player, it has plenty of room to run, making the current price of $0.18 in the bonus round a highly undervalued price. According to the expert projection of $12, DTX could increase by 6,566% from the current level. $100 invested could become $6,666 after the token lists on Binance. Due to the last round, tokens are selling out rapidly, and investors interested must act now to grab slots.

Last Monday, Ethereum made an effort to push past the $3,000 mark. However, it found itself unable to hold its ground, eventually slipping below the $2,800 threshold. This has left many investors on edge, eagerly looking for promising alternatives to recover their losses. Enter DTX Exchange (DTX), the new sensation attracting significant interest from Ethereum whales. Potential of DTX Exchange in a Fluctuating Market As Ethereum wrestles with its bearish trends, the spotlight has turned toward DTX Exchange. Recent investments from major Ethereum holders suggest DTX could be positioned among the top-tier altcoins by 2025. This has spurred a rush among investors and traders eager to secure their piece of this burgeoning opportunity before the presale concludes. Why Investors are Pivoting Towards DTX Faced with Ethereum's ongoing price consolidations and macroeconomic uncertainties, the DTX Exchange offers a refreshing promise of stability and growth. With its presale nearing completion, the project has managed to sell over 375 million tokens, signaling strong potential to dominate the cryptocurrency market.

The platform promises a comprehensive trading experience, offering access to over 120,000 assets including forex, stocks, and digital assets like NFTs.

The network’s difficulty saw its first decline since September, indicating that even though publicly listed companies have kept increasing their hash power, their growth isn't enough to compensate for the capitulation of other, probably smaller operators. The total revenue made from bitcoin (BTC) mining remained stable at $1.4 billion for the month. Publicly traded mining companies, which collectively hold 99,000 bitcoin (worth roughly $9.7 billion), accounted for about 30% of the hashrate market share in January. Competition between the biggest publicly traded companies has also increased. The leading mining firm, Marathon Digital (MARA), retained its top spot with a realized hashrate of 41.65 EH/s, followed by CleanSpark at 34.77 EH/s. Riot Platforms, which has been expanding aggressively, is closing in with 31.27 EH/s. “Notably, the competition within the 30 EH/s group is heating up like never before, while the gap between the 30 EH/s tier and the 10 EH/s group — comprising Core Scientific, Cipher Mining, and Bitfarms — continues to widen,” the report said. The top miners taking more market share is hardly a surprise as the recent halving event has cut bitcoin mining rewards by half and squeezed the industry's profit margin, even with the BTC price near $100,000. In such an environment, it's tough for smaller players to compete with big operations which were already positioned to dominate the market. In fact, a lot of miners are already looking for other revenue sources, such as hosting machines for AI and HPC firms. Read more: Bitcoin Halving Is a 'Show Me the Money' Moment for Miners The report also said that mining hardware imports to the U.S. also slowed in January, a factor contributing to the stabilization of hashrate growth. However, some firms, including Blockchain Power Corp and AcroHash, have imported a significant amount of cooling infrastructure from Bitmain. Looking ahead, TheMinerMag predicts another difficulty adjustment decline in February as some smaller mining operators exit the market due to lower profitability.

XRP leads in cross-border transactions, but emerging tokens like BeerBear offer community-driven rewards and engagement. Table of Contents XRP’s unique value proposition BeerBear: A community-driven alternative Regulatory developments and market influence Comparing XRP and BeerBear’s market position Potential growth factors and adoption Conclusion As the cryptocurrency market continues to expand and adapt to regulatory shifts, XRP remains a key player in the evolving digital asset landscape. Known for its use in cross-border transactions and blockchain-based financial solutions, XRP has positioned itself as a utility-driven asset with real-world applications. However, while XRP focuses on financial institutions and payment providers, newer tokens like BeerBear are emerging as community-driven alternatives that offer additional layers of engagement and reward-based incentives. With ongoing developments in the regulatory space and increasing institutional adoption, many are assessing how XRP compares to advanced projects such as BeerBear. You might also like: Crypto investors bet on BeerBear as it exceeds expectations XRP’s unique value proposition Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that function primarily as stores of value or decentralized finance (DeFi) assets, XRP was designed for facilitating fast and low-cost cross-border transactions. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) operates as a decentralized blockchain, allowing financial institutions and payment providers to settle transactions more efficiently compared to traditional banking systems. This functionality has enabled XRP to establish partnerships with banks and remittance companies looking to streamline international payments. The efficiency of the XRPL is one of its standout features, offering settlement times of just a few seconds and significantly lower fees compared to traditional banking intermediaries. These advantages have positioned XRP as a strong alternative to legacy financial systems that still rely on outdated and expensive money transfer mechanisms. BeerBear: A community-driven alternative While XRP caters primarily to institutional adoption and financial services, BeerBear takes a different approach by integrating play-to-earn gaming and decentralized incentives into its ecosystem. Unlike XRP, which is largely driven by partnerships with banks, BeerBear is designed to engage users through an interactive gaming experience that allows them to earn rewards. BeerBear’s ecosystem includes a structured presale model, starting at $0.0004 and increasing incrementally to $0.0020. This progressive pricing strategy provides early participants with an opportunity to engage with the project while promoting sustainable market growth, making it a more predictable alternative compared to tokens with volatile early-stage pricing. The “Bar Brawl” arcade-style game further enhances user engagement by rewarding players with tokens and NFTs, making it a more interactive alternative for those who prefer active participation over passive holding. Regulatory developments and market influence XRP has been at the center of regulatory discussions, particularly with its legal battle involving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Meanwhile, BeerBear benefits from a decentralized and community-driven governance model, which allows it to operate in a more flexible environment with fewer regulatory hurdles. The outcome of this case has had a significant impact on XRP’s market sentiment, influencing investor confidence and institutional participation. With recent court rulings providing more clarity on its classification, XRP has seen renewed interest from financial institutions exploring blockchain-based solutions. BeerBear, on the other hand, benefits from a decentralized and community-driven governance model that reduces reliance on regulatory frameworks tied to financial institutions. Unlike XRP, which operates in a heavily scrutinized industry, BeerBear’s focus on gaming and entertainment allows it to grow within a more flexible environment, making it an attractive option for retail participants looking for an alternative to institutionally dominated tokens. Comparing XRP and BeerBear’s market position As the crypto space continues to evolve, competition among blockchain payment solutions and play-to-earn tokens is increasing. While XRP has maintained its position as a leader in cross-border payments, BeerBear differentiates itself by targeting a growing sector of blockchain-based gaming and interactive rewards. XRP’s efficiency in financial transactions is undeniable, but its reliance on institutional partnerships means that market fluctuations and regulatory developments could impact its trajectory. In contrast, BeerBear’s decentralized and user-driven approach offers a unique growth opportunity that doesn’t depend on traditional banking integrations. With its strong security framework — supported by three independent audits — BeerBear is positioning itself as a promising alternative for those looking to engage in a more interactive crypto ecosystem. Potential growth factors and adoption Several factors could contribute to XRP’s continued adoption and BeerBear’s growing popularity. The expansion of blockchain-based financial services may boost XRP’s relevance, while the rapid rise of play-to-earn gaming could drive BeerBear’s adoption. As more users seek engaging and reward-based blockchain experiences, BeerBear’s emphasis on gaming incentives and decentralized governance could make it a strong competitor in the evolving market. Moreover, developments within the BeerBear ecosystem, including NFT integrations and governance mechanisms, could expand its functionality beyond gaming. If these innovations gain traction, BeerBear may emerge as a leading player in the next wave of blockchain adoption.

Conclusion XRP continues to play a significant role in the evolving cryptocurrency market, particularly in the area of cross-border payments and blockchain financial solutions. At the same time, BeerBear is emerging as a competitive alternative, leveraging play-to-earn gaming and decentralized incentives to create an engaged and interactive community-driven ecosystem. However, as the crypto landscape expands, alternative projects like BeerBear are gaining attention for their unique approaches to blockchain engagement. While XRP remains a dominant force in financial settlements, BeerBear’s focus on community-driven rewards and play-to-earn gaming positions it as a compelling alternative. With the continued rise of gaming-focused blockchain ecosystems, BeerBear offers a new perspective on user participation in the crypto space.

Which projects to invest in?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/political-memecoins-the-new-gem-in-2025-which-projects-to-invest-in,"If you've been following the cryptocurrency market at all, you've probably heard about the rise of Donald Trump's official $TRUMP memecoin and other political memecoins. The crypto community has shown unprecedented interest in the industry over the past few months. Earning with a competent approach has become quite realistic. In this article, we will tell you how political memecoins have taken over the crypto market, how much you can earn with them and analyse a few promising tokens that you can take a closer look at right now. How did the trend for political memecoins come about? Political meme coins themselves are not a new trend. It began to emerge a year ago, during the campaign between the Republican and Democratic parties in the US elections. This was the first time that cryptocurrencies were used en masse as a means of attracting attention and expressing a point of view. Even then, the first crypto coins representing presidential candidates appeared on the market in the form of MAGA and BODEN tokens. At the peak of their popularity, the coins reached a market capitalization of $750 million and $600 million respectively. Their success was followed by new memecoins that were in some way related to politics. By the end of 2024, tokens such as PATRIOT, AMC, MAGA AGAIN and dozens of other large tokens had already appeared, and CoinMarketCap had a separate tab dedicated to political memecoins. In January 2025, the day before Trump's inauguration, a new star appeared in the political memecoin industry - the TRUMP coin, which grew to $14 billion in a matter of hours, quickly becoming one of the top 100 coins by capitalisation. Following the success of TRUMP , the market was swept by a veritable boom of political memecoins. Hundreds of tokens related to Trump and other political figures and events appeared every day. The lifespan of most of these coins was 1-2 days, after which the coin creators staged ragpools. Nevertheless, it was still possible to find a promising coin among the large number of junk coins that could make its early investors a profit. How much could be made from $TRUMP, MELANIA and other political memecoins? And so we come to the present day. The trend of political memecoins is still developing. This means that it is possible to make money with the right analysis. To understand the scale of this, let's take a look at the profits that could be made by investing in the political Memecoins that shot up earlier. The TRUMP coin ended up making the most money for those who bought the coin in the first few minutes after the announcement tweet was published. Many lucky people who managed to jump on the bandwagon made 100-200 times their money. Thus, after buying a token for $200, they earned $20000-40000. A similar yield was given by the coin of Donald Trump's wife - MELANIA. You could make 170 times in a few hours. For an investment of $200 you would get $34000. However, it was a real challenge to buy tokens at a good price. What's even better is that it doesn't happen very often. It is much easier to ride and earn on the coin that grows gradually. For example, the FPIBANK project token could be bought at a good price for several days, after which the token showed 80x growth. Anyone who could see a future rocket in the token could get in. And there was plenty of time to do so. So an investment of $200 could make you $16000! Which promising projects can be highlighted now? So what's happening on the market at the moment? Is it possible to find new rockets and how difficult is it? This question is asked by many people, so you can find terabytes of content on this topic. However, finding such coins and making a profit turns out not to be for everyone. Our editors would like to share with you the results of our own research. However, we would like to mention that we are only giving you one project to analyse. Do your own research and do not rely on other people's opinions when buying. We think GOHOME and BABY TRUMP tokens are promising. Why is that? Let's have a quick analysis of each of them. GOHOME is an interesting iteration of political memecoins. The name suggests that the token is related to the issue of illegal immigration in the United States, which Trump is now actively addressing. The ticker itself is somewhat reminiscent of the GME (GameStop) ticker. There is an interesting story behind the creation of the token. The day after Trump's inauguration, the first laws restricting illegal immigration began to appear. In this wave, the Spanish-language version of the White House website was removed. In its place was a splash page with a 404 error and a very bold 'GO HOME' notice. The page did not last long, however. It was soon changed to 'Go to home page'. But the internet remembered the page with this crude and straightforward caption. The story quickly went viral and the GOHOME project was born, which the team says is a symbol of justice and the protection of civil rights. The token quickly gained popularity as it played on a growing narrative and appealed to a large number of people. The capitalization of the project has now reached $283 million. However, it is important to understand that this is the capitalization of all coins, including those that have not yet been released. The thing is, there are only 500k GOHOME coins available at the moment. And the remaining 9.5 million coins will be released over the next 4 years. The next major unlocks are not scheduled until autumn 2025 - 90% of the tokens will be unlocked in 4 years when Trump's term is over. 250,000 tokens will be unlocked in 2 years and the remaining 250,000 in the next 2 years, so the token capitalisation at the current coin count is only $14.1 million. (500,000 tokens times the current price of $28.1). This is far from a large memecoin, and with limited issuance and no airdrop, 10-30 times the current price of $28 is realistic. The token was launched on 22 January and is currently trading on Jupiter. However, the active growth phase only began on 6 February . The project has launched an active marketing campaign, so the audience has grown very rapidly in recent weeks. The team is somewhat reminiscent of Michael Saylor and his company Strategy. They are using similar methods to promote their project. In the roadmap, the team has indicated a preliminary token price that they expect to see in the near future. The token should cross the $100 mark in February and reach $1,000 in the second quarter. The team has no plans to ever sell their tokens. Instead, they are taking out loans secured against their own token and using them to buy back GOHOME coins from the market, to stake and invest in other projects. If you are planning to buy the token, we would advise you to do so before it reaches $60. A price higher than that will be potentially dangerous to enter due to increased risks. The first profit from the token can be seen 2-3 months after the purchase. Then there is a high probability that the trend of political memecoins will continue and the price of the token will increase significantly. The second fixation can be made before the big splits at the end of October. The token has great prospects - this is a project where you can earn not x5 in 5 hours, but x50 in 5 months . Thus, the GOHOME project looks like a worthy investment in the political memecoin space. It can bring good profits through active development, involvement in narratives and balanced tokenomics. BABY TRUMP is another political memecoin that was created long before the memecoinboom - in 2023 - and trades on PancakeSwap and Raydium. The visual component of BABY TRUMP looks stylish. The project is still in development, but has not been as active as it used to be. Now the price of the token has dropped significantly, which means that it can be bought for a small amount for a future pump. The project periodically releases limited edition clothing and NFTs, as well as parodies based on real-life political events. It is likely that one of these activities could see the token shoot up. The upside could be limited to 3-5 times. However, this is more risky than GOHOME, so we strongly advise you to do your own research and enter the project with considerable experience. For beginners, this is an over-risk story. The project has been off the radar so far, so now is a good time to buy. BABY TRUMP has potential and a long history. It is only a matter of time before a new round of growth begins. Editorial Opinion Political memecoins for February 2025 are at the peak of their popularity. And it is possible to make a lot of money with them. The main thing is to be able to find a future meme among the huge number of weak and skimpy projects. Study memes, immerse yourself in the current news agenda and learn to analyse new projects yourself. As for the projects we have reviewed, GOHOME may be influenced by Trump's policy decisions regarding undocumented migrants, in addition to natural development. This will further increase interest in a difficult issue. In addition, any high-profile statements by Trump that stir up emotions will definitely be reflected in the price of BABY TRUMP, GOHOME and most other political memecoins. Stay tuned! Trump's presidential term has just begun, which means there are many interesting events ahead that will affect memecoins and the entire crypto market. Have fun investing and see you soon!

In a statement, the Økokrim says the modus swindled NOK 900 million ($80.80 million) from thousands of people who joined a multi-level marketing network that recruited members in different places around the world. The indictment says the members were deceived into believing they would get a share in the investments and profits of a highly profitable business with purported stakes in a gas field, mining and real estate if they purchase product packages of the business’ own cryptocurrencies and shares. The Økokrim says that in reality, the business did not make significant investments and had no earnings other than from the deposits of the members. The network laundered the money it received and then distributed it as returns to the top networkers, backers and existing members. Says Økokrim State Prosecutor Joakim Ziesler Berge, “We believe this is a large and extensive fraud. We are talking about a great many victims in many countries who have lost their money and significant sums that have ended up with the defendants.” The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) says the four men are in their 50s, 60s and 70s.

Headed by Laura D’Allaird, CETU replaces the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit and includes a team of roughly 30 fraud specialists and attorneys working across multiple SEC divisions. CETU Takes Charge According to the official press release , CETU will leverage its staff’s fintech and cybersecurity expertise to address misconduct in securities transactions. The newly established enforcement unit’s priorities include combating fraud involving artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain technology, as well as preventing crypto-related scams. The focus will also be on cyber threats like hacking for material nonpublic information, retail brokerage account takeovers, and fraudulent schemes using social media, the dark web, or fake websites. Additionally, CETU will ensure regulated entities comply with cybersecurity rules and scrutinize public issuers for misleading cybersecurity disclosures for investor protection and market integrity. In an official statement, Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda stated, “Under Laura’s leadership, this new unit will complement the work of the Crypto Task Force led by Commissioner Hester Peirce. Importantly, the new unit will also allow the SEC to deploy enforcement resources judiciously. The unit will not only protect investors but will also facilitate capital formation and market efficiency by clearing the way for innovation to grow. It will root out those seeking to misuse innovation to harm investors and diminish confidence in new technologies.” SEC’s Legal Shifts The SEC’s creation of the CETU comes amid a series of positive developments from the agency. Under Uyeda, the SEC recently voluntarily dismissed its appeal of a lawsuit challenging its dealer rule expansion, a move welcomed by industry participants who viewed the rule as an indirect attempt to regulate crypto trading firms. Additionally, the SEC’s recent court filings in enforcement cases against Binance , Coinbase , and Lejilex requested stays, citing the agency’s efforts to develop a crypto regulatory framework, which is expected to pave the way for more constructive resolutions. These developments have further fueled speculation about a possible withdrawal of the Ripple case.

One project gaining traction offers a hybrid trading platform with futures and over 120,000 assets—all while bypassing the congestion plaguing larger networks. Another altcoin, DTX Exchange, is currently in a bonus presale stage after surging 800% from its initial price, this low-cap altcoin combines blockchain transparency with institutional-grade security. With Q2 approaching, market watchers suggest it could mirror Solana’s early growth while offering a more stable entry point for retail traders. Solana Falls to $165 as Market Shifts Ahead of Q2 The Solana price has dipped to $165, reflecting broader uncertainty as traders adjust portfolios before Q2. Over the past week, SOL dropped nearly 17%, while monthly losses exceeded 38%. This downturn is despite previous bullish outlooks, such as Grok's estimation that Solana might hit $1,000 before the end of 2025. Source: Solana Price, CoinMarketCap Current network congestion and delays in transactions, especially during high-traffic meme coin launches such as TRUMP, have caused alarm. While the Solana price processed over $28.8 billion in daily transactions in January, its current instability contrasts sharply with its reputation for speed. Analysts note that the Solana price faces increasing competition from newer platforms offering smoother user experiences. For example, one project gaining traction allows retail investors early access to presale tokens—a feature often reserved for institutional players in other ecosystems. This shift highlights a growing preference for democratized opportunities, which could further impact Solana’s market position if congestion issues persist. Cardano Slips 4% Weekly, Losing Momentum Cardano has seen a 4% weekly decline, with ADA hovering near $0.76. Monthly performance shows a 25% drop, underscoring its struggle to regain momentum after peaking at $3.10 in late 2024. Despite this, Cardano continues advancing its governance framework, with self-governance milestones and a privacy-focused chain Midnight slated for 2025. These developments aim to expand ADA’s utility, but regulatory ambiguity under the current U.S. administration has slowed adoption. Source: Cardano Price, CoinMarketCap Investors remain cautious as Cardano’s treasury prepares to allocate funds for ecosystem growth in 2025. While long-term believers highlight its research-driven upgrades, short-term volatility persists. Comparatively, emerging platforms with hybrid trading models and lower entry points are attracting attention. For instance, a presale project offering tokens at $0.18 has already surged 800% since its initial phase, outpacing ADA’s recent performance. DTX Exchange Rises to $0.18, Poised for a Breakout During the turbulence for Solana and Cardano, DTX Exchange has emerged as a standout. Priced at $0.18 during its bonus presale stage, the token has surged 800% from its first-stage price of $0.02. With $14.7 million raised and demand forcing an extension of the presale, analysts highlight DTX’s potential as the next big thing in decentralized finance. The platform’s hybrid model supports over 120,000 assets—from crypto to stocks—while leveraging blockchain for transparency. Security audits by firms like SolidProof and a capped supply of 475 million tokens add to its appeal. Unlike Solana’s recent struggles with transaction delays, DTX emphasizes seamless trading experiences. Its presale success—accessible to all investors, not just institutions—contrasts with ADA’s slower retail adoption. Market observers suggest DTX could mirror Solana’s early growth trajectory but with greater stability, making it a top crypto to invest in ahead of its Q2 launch. Source: ADA and Solana Price, Comparison, CoinMarketCap As major alts like Solana and Cardano navigate corrections, the DTX Exchange 's rapid rise underscores a shift toward projects blending innovation with accessibility. With Q2 approaching, its presale window offers a limited opportunity before potential parabolic moves post-launch. Final Conclusion While the Solana price correction and Cardano’s sluggish momentum reflect broader market uncertainty, a new hybrid platform is capturing attention with its presale surge. Priced at $0.18 after an 800% rally, the project merges institutional-grade trading tools with blockchain transparency—addressing issues like network congestion that have weighed on ADA and SOL. Analysts speculate its Q2 launch could mirror early rallies seen in top altcoins, making the current presale stage a rare opportunity.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Shiba Inu dips to $0.00001514, but traders target $0.000078 by summer, while Panshibi sparks meme coin speculation. Table of Contents Shiba Inu price trends and Dubai’s VARA alert The emergence of Panshibi Conclusion The Shiba Inu price sits around $0.00001514, down about 3% in the last 24 hours, yet traders eye a bold target of $0.000078 by summer. Amid this speculation, the meme coin sector’s market cap soared from $20 billion to $120 billion in 2024, leading authorities like Dubai’s VARA to warn about exaggerated claims and risks. Meanwhile, a new panda-themed entrant named Panshibi is also drawing speculators eager for the next meme coin surge. Panshibi appears to ride a wave of renewed curiosity. You might also like: Why XRP price could drop under $2 soon, and what Panshibi is all about Shiba Inu price trends and Dubai’s VARA alert Shiba Inu (SHIB) commands a market cap of nearly $8.8 billion but remains subject to sharp swings. Many observers connect its future moves to Ethereum’s momentum, believing a bullish ETH could lift Shiba out of its slump. However, regulatory bodies such as Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) caution about meme coins’ reliance on social media hype. VARA highlights that some tokens lack intrinsic value and call for better investor vigilance. Under these guidelines, memecoins created within Dubai must follow strict rulebooks to avoid misleading promotions or oversized claims. Analysts note that Shiba Inu’s price rose 65% over the past year despite short-term drops, reflecting its resilience. Still, for Shiba Inu to reach the lofty $0.000078 target, it must break above current downtrend levels. If it fails, a revisit to lower support zones near $0.000010 could occur. The Ministry of Energy’s recent partnership with Shiba Inu hints at more practical use cases, potentially offsetting negative sentiment. Should global markets steady, SHIB may see renewed optimism, fueling the coin’s next rally. The emergence of Panshibi While Shiba Inu grapples with staying above $0.000015, a new comedic token named Panshibi is drawing interest. Priced at $0.005, the project has raised over $1 million in its early presale. Unlike many meme coins relying purely on hype, Panshibi integrates security measures such as a 10-year liquidity lock and a two-year team token lock. An AI-driven “social-fi” system further distinguishes Panshibi. Through staking, quests, and interactive features, holders engage beyond a simple buy-and-hold approach. Such unique features resonate with investors seeking more substance than the usual wave of ephemeral dog tokens. If Shiba Inu struggles to break its current price barriers, Panshibi could see capital rotating into its presale, especially among traders chasing novelty and higher upside. Panshibi also captures attention for its panda theme, offering a fresh spin in a meme coin world mostly centered on dogs or frogs. Supporters argue that combining comedic branding with tangible protections allows Panshibi to stand out from typical short-lived projects. Though it lacks Shiba Inu’s established name recognition, early momentum suggests SHIBI could capitalize on any wave of renewed meme coin enthusiasm in 2025. Conclusion As the Shiba Inu price flirts with key resistance, Dubai’s VARA warns the public about inflated meme coin promotions. Meanwhile, Shiba’s recent partnership with the UAE Ministry of Energy underscores a push toward real-world relevance. The coin’s 65% yearly climb indicates resilience, yet reaching $0.000078 may hinge on breaking out of its downtrend and benefiting from Ethereum’s strength. During this uncertainty, Panshibi emerges as a playful alternative, integrating comedic visuals with serious security steps. It’s selling at $0.005 during presale, and over $1 million in raised funds shows genuine traction. An AI-focused “social-fi” approach aims to maintain engagement and stability, contrasting the quick-burn model often seen in meme coins. Whether Shiba Inu surges or stalls, Panshibi offers a distinct blend of humor and robustness that could capture the next wave of meme-oriented speculators.

Yet, as these titans show signs of faltering, new challengers are entering the fray, promising innovative solutions to longstanding issues. One such contender is DTX Exchange, an altcoin capturing attention due to its rapid presale success. While established coins struggle, DTX Exchange offers a refreshing alternative with a comprehensive trading platform that seamlessly integrates futures and a wide array of assets, bypassing current network bottlenecks seen in larger coins. Solana's Decline: Challenges in the Midst of Expansion Solana, once heralded for its blazing transaction speeds, now finds itself grappling with network issues that have led to a price drop to $165. This decline, representing a substantial percentage loss over the past month, challenges previous forecasts that positioned Solana for stellar growth by 2025. Despite processing billions in transactions, recent events have highlighted critical vulnerabilities. Source: Solana Price, CoinMarketCap The popularity of meme coins has inadvertently stressed Solana’s infrastructure, causing delays and sparking investor concerns about future reliability. As a result, emerging platforms are offering solutions that appeal to traders seeking stability and fluid transaction capabilities. Cardano's Struggles and the Search for New Opportunities Cardano, another notable cryptocurrency, finds itself in a similar predicament. With ADA's value decreasing by 4% over the last week and more than 20% over the past month, the project is in a phase of introspection and adaptation, particularly with upcoming initiatives like its self-governance features. Source: Cardano Price, CoinMarketCap Regulatory ambiguity in key markets has tempered some of the excitement around Cardano's innovations, placing a greater spotlight on startups like DTX, which promise quicker returns on investments with fewer barriers to entry. The DTX Exchange Phenomenon: A New Frontier Amidst these larger market shifts, DTX Exchange emerges not only as a beacon of growth but as a representative of what future trading platforms may look like. Priced initially at $0.02, DTX has witnessed an extraordinary surge, with its current value sitting at $0.18—a phenomenal 800% increase. With its presale gaining momentum and a model that supports over 120,000 assets, the platform attracts both novice and seasoned investors. Analysts underscore its hybrid model's potential, which uniquely combines cutting-edge blockchain transparency with unmatched trading versatility. Security assessments by SolidProof and a limited token supply enhance DTX’s appeal, presenting it as a formidable competitor to Solana’s previous reputation for speed, while sidestepping the congestion challenges. Source: ADA and Solana Price, Comparison, CoinMarketCap The rush toward DTX marks a pivotal shift in investor interest, demonstrating a preference for projects that prioritize democratization in access and innovation. With its launch on the horizon, this burgeoning platform represents a tantalizing prospect for investors eyeing substantial returns. Looking Ahead While industry giants like Solana and Cardano attempt to overcome recent setbacks, the market landscape is subtly adjusting to accommodate platforms like DTX Exchange. As a top contender for investment in anticipation of Q2, it encapsulates a blend of technological innovation and accessibility. Now is an opportune moment for potential investors to explore its offerings before the platform potentially parallels the early successes of its predecessors.

The YLDS stablecoin, launched by Figure Markets, will be pegged to the US dollar and offer users a 0.5% yield, which puts it in direct competition with Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). YLDS is reportedly fully compliant with the SEC’s regulations, a detail that CEO Mike Cagney says gives it a clear legal advantage over USDC and USDT. “We think this is a hugely transformative play. If I can hold this, if I can self-custody this, if it pays me interest, and I can actually use it to transact, what do I need a bank for?” Figure’s SEC win comes after a year Figure filed its application over a year ago, betting that a yield-generating, regulator-approved stablecoin could change the industry. The timing is pretty important, too, as the total market cap of stablecoins has surged past $225 billion, according to DefiLlama, more than doubling since the last crypto bear market. But while demand is high, most stablecoins exist in a legal gray zone. Tether leads the pack, with a market cap of over $140 billion, and USDC follows at $56 billion. Both rely on US Treasury reserves to generate billions in interest, yet neither pays holders a single cent. Figure’s stablecoin is the first of its kind to be structured as a security. That means it will be regulated like stocks and bonds, requiring full SEC oversight. Users who want to earn the 0.5% yield must complete a Know-Your-Customer (KYC) process. If YLDS is transferred to someone who hasn’t completed KYC, they can hold the stablecoin but won’t receive the interest. While Figure has not disclosed how many users have signed up, Cagney said he expects strong demand. The company plans to launch YLDS later today, making it available first to users who pass the identity verification process. Cagney also pointed out the risks tied to unregulated stablecoins. “There’s a lot of skepticism about the ability for them to support withdrawals,” he said, referring to offshore stablecoins that have faced liquidity concerns. SEC launches a new fraud unit On the same day YLDS got approved, the SEC announced a new enforcement division focused on cyber and emerging technologies. The Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit (CETU) will replace the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, following through with its promised change in how the agency plans to regulate fintech. Laura D’Allaird, the new unit’s chief, will oversee a team of 30 attorneys and fraud specialists spread across multiple SEC offices. Their focus is tracking and prosecuting fraud in blockchain, AI, and social media-driven scams. “Under Laura’s leadership, this new unit will complement the work of the Crypto Task Force led by Commissioner Hester Peirce,” said SEC Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda. In its official statement , the SEC outlined key priorities for CETU, which are Cracking down on fraud tied to AI and machine learning, investigating crypto scams that use social media and fake websites, going after hackers who leak insider financial data, as well as protecting retail investors from fraudulent tokens and Ponzi schemes.

Table of Contents XRP holds strong amid market fluctuations ChowWow: The rising star in the Solana ecosystem Why are investors turning to ChowWow? XRP vs. ChowWow : Which one offers more potential? Is it too late to invest in ChowWow? Conclusion The crypto bull run is in full swing, and while XRP holds strong, a new SOL token is quickly gaining momentum. ChowWow (CHOW) is attracting investor interest. With early buyers looking for the next high-growth cryptocurrency, many are wondering if this meme coin could become the next bull run favorite. XRP holds strong amid market fluctuations Despite ongoing market shifts, XRP still attracts institutional and retail investors. The token is well known for being the most resilient type of asset in the crypto space, especially for its utility in cross-border transactions. But with investors thirsty for high reward tokens, new tokens like ChowWow are turning out to be attractive alternatives. ChowWow: The rising star in the Solana ecosystem ChowWow is rapidly growing as a new SOL token . The meme coin’s presale has seen significant demand, as investors recognize the potential for massive returns. Unlike the majority of tokens, ChowWow doesn’t rely entirely on speculation; it has play-to-earn, stake-to-earn mechanics, and real utility within the ecosystem. The Solana network has seen a surge in popularity due to its high-speed transactions and lower fees. As more developers and investors migrate to Solana, ChowWow is well-positioned to benefit from the network’s growth. This makes it an appealing option for those looking to capitalize on the crypto bull run. Why are investors turning to ChowWow? CHOW has the early-stage potential, which is one major advantage. Investors who bought into successful meme coins early, such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, saw exponential gains. While the ChowWow presale is still open, there is a unique opportunity to buy in before exchange listings move prices higher. The strong and engaged community of the token is also helping it gain traction. As a meme coin, ChowWow thrives on engagement on social media, and it has already gathered a large base of followers. Community-driven growth has been a key factor in the success of past bull run favorites, and this token is following a similar trajectory. XRP vs. ChowWow : Which one offers more potential ? XRP and CHOW are both attractive to different kinds of investors and have different strengths. Stability makes XRP a good choice for people who are looking for less risky, long-term holding options. It is already being used in global finance and has institutional backing. On the other hand, ChowWow is a high-growth cryptocurrency with a huge upside potential. XRP is one of the strongest cryptocurrencies, but its price movements are usually slower than those of meme coins, which are still coming up. For investors seeking rapid gains, ChowWow presents an exciting opportunity in the current crypto bull run. Is it too late to invest in ChowWow? Luckily, the ChowWow presale is open, and investors can still buy at lower prices before the token gains widespread exposure. Historically, early investments in meme coins have led to large profits, and ChowWow is showing signs of following this trend. With its community-driven momentum and real utility through play-to-earn and stake-to-earn mechanics, the token is quickly becoming a bull run favorite. The combination of strong fundamentals and early adoption makes it an appealing choice for investors looking to capitalize on the crypto bull run. Conclusion Investors are looking for new ways to make money, and there are new opportunities while XRP holds strong. ChowWow is gaining momentum as a new SOL token, with a community continuing to grow and strong presale demand. For those seeking a high-growth cryptocurrency, CHOW offers an exciting alternative to traditional blue-chip assets. With its unique features and potential for massive returns, it’s no surprise that this bull run favourite is generating serious investor interest.

This marks the first protocol to allow flexible, high-level programmable workflows for smart contracts that AI agents can autonomously execute under strict, immutable guardrails. Traditional smart contracts are slow, expensive, and rigid. They require months of audits and updates to support new features. Halliday’s protocol removes these constraints, enabling developers to build blockchain applications without writing new smart contracts for every use case. By providing a unified programming model, the Agentic Workflow Protocol streamlines development, significantly reducing backend infrastructure development. As blockchain adoption scales, developers must integrate decentralized applications across a growing number of protocols, chains, and services. The complexity of blockchain ecosystems burdens developers, who dedicate years to integrations and infrastructure work rather than core product innovation. Halliday’s Agentic Workflow Protocol addresses inefficiencies by allowing developers to define on-chain workflows in a high-level programming model, significantly reducing development cycles and operational overhead. Halliday’s approach introduces agentic workflows—tasks with immutable guardrails that allow AI autonomous systems, agents and software, to execute actions on behalf of users while ensuring safety and compliance. This enables developers to automate on-chain actions across smart contracts seamlessly. Zero-trust AI delegation means AI agents safely perform blockchain transactions within predefined constraints, ensuring compliance and security. A unified programming model lets developers define workflows in familiar high-level languages instead of low-level contract code. On top of this, pre-built integrations remove the need for custom infrastructure and Halliday handles execution logic across multiple services and chains. ""In shifting the paradigm from smart contract development to agentic workflows, we are bring blockchain in the agentic era,"" said Griffin Dunaif, CEO of Halliday. ""This is a major step forward for businesses looking to integrate AI and blockchain, allowing developers to build applications in hours not years."" Halliday’s protocol was built to be future-proof and forward-composable, meaning workflows adapt automatically to new protocols and virtual machines without requiring costly updates, making development faster, safer, and more scalable. The agentic workflow protocol is currently in early access and is being rolled out over the course of Q2. Developers interested in leveraging agentic workflows are invited to join the Q2 early access program . About Halliday Halliday is the first Agentic Workflow protocol that lets developers assign tasks to autonomous systems, such as agents or software. Halliday enables you to create breakthrough applications in minutes not years. Halliday Payments, the first-party application built on top of the protocol, offers an all-in-one payments experience, enabling users to go from fiat-to-crypto, crypto-to-crypto, and crypto-to-fiat – the full cycle of money on a new network..

The report also indicated that pig butchering scams scammed investors in 200,000 identified cases last year. A report by Chainalysis also revealed that pig butchering, a type of romance and investment scam, received 33.2% of the most crypto among scam sub-classes. Pig butchering scams also recorded an increase of 40% year over year of scam revenue. The number of deposits to pig butchering scams also grew nearly 210% over the same period. Pig butchering scams steal nearly $5.5B in 2024 Pig butchering scams stole $5.5B from crypto investors in 2024. These scams manipulate victims for weeks or months, tricking them into sending funds to fake platforms. 200,000 cases identified on Ethereum alone. pic.twitter.com/0KCuIl6ufE — 🚨 Cyvers Alerts 🚨 (@CyversAlerts) February 20, 2025 Cyvers reported that pig butchering scams had received over $5.5 billion in 1.15 million fraudulent transactions. Pig butchering scams are manipulative tactics that deceive victims into transferring billions to fake investment platforms. The report indicated that the schemes on the Ethereum network cost the industry over $5.5B across 200,000 identified cases in 2024. It also identified pig butchering scams that affected three of the five largest centralized exchanges (CEXs), a crypto-friendly bank, and an institutional trading platform. Michael Pearl, vice president of GMT strategy at Cyvers, believes that pig butchering schemes are “by far the biggest threat,” even compared to crypto hacks. In 2024, cryptocurrency hackers stole over $2.3 billion worth of digital assets across 165 incidents. There was also a 40% increase in crypto hackers in 2024 compared to 2023 when losses totaled $1.69 billion. Cyvers maintained that pig butchering scams were a type of phishing scheme different from hacks, where attackers trick users into willingly sending their assets. The firm reported that the average grooming period for victims lasted between one and two weeks in 35% of cases. Ten percent of pig butchering scams also involved grooming periods of up to three months. The data showed that 75% of pig butchering scam victims lost over half of their net worth to the scams. According to the company, pig butchering scams mostly affected men aged 30 to 49. Cyvers also found that generative artificial intelligence and AI-based social media chatbots were helping scammers scale their attacks. Deddy Lavid, co-founder and CEO of Cyvers, said that central exchanges were the most affected by pig butchering scams. Lavid added that CEXs were hemorrhaging millions, grappling with a reputational crisis, struggling to maintain banking relationships, and facing increased regulatory scrutiny. He also acknowledged that efforts to combat the scams were underway and would range from industry-led initiatives to government-driven regulatory actions and enforcement efforts. Cyvers also revealed that December 2024 was the biggest month for pig butchering schemes. The scams cost the industry over $468 million from $424M in November 2024. Pig butchering scams increased in 2024 The Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia had filed a lawsuit in July 2024 to recover digital assets seized by the FBI from pig butchering scams abroad. The Attorney’s Office wanted to forfeit 2.5M USDT seized from two accounts controlled by a pig butchering perpetrator in Thailand. “The rate at which bad actors are using elaborate pig-butchering scams to defraud innocent people is despicable. The FBI and our law enforcement partners continue to evolve investigative techniques to thwart the progression of this threat and use all available resources to ensure we disrupt and dismantle organizations responsible for contributing to these crimes.” – Special Agent Stacey Moy of the FBI’s San Diego Field Office. Chainalysis reported that pig butchering scammers had evolved to diversify their business model beyond the “long con” of pig butchering scams. Pig butchering scams could take months and even years to first develop a relationship, but scammers now prefer employment or work-from-home scams that typically yield smaller victim deposits. The research noted that cybersecurity company Proofpoint found a fraudulent job site impersonating a record label offering work-from-home jobs. The job site had sent crypto to consolidation wallets, and a pig butchering scam also sent funds. Proofpoint had shared consolidation addresses, and Chainalysis was able to connect the scam domains on-chain. The research firm also noted that Nigeria’s anti-graft agency had arrested almost 800 people in a raid on a building in December last year. The suspects were alleged to be running romance scams that targeted people mostly from Europe and the U.S. Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",News|Cyvers|FBI,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|RESEARCH|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-20 18:00:13

Source: TradingView At current levels, Aptos is trading in a downward channel. The William Alligator trendlines signal waning volatility, while the relative strength index is in neutral territory. The MACD histograms indicate rising positive market momentum. Aptos 4-hour chart price analysis Aptos 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart, unlike the daily chart, shows rising volatility while registering positive price momentum on the MACD histograms. The price trend on the chart is neutral. Watch the $5.67 level on the chart at the channel’s lower trendline if the drop continues. The cryptocurrency could find support near a range of narrow consolidation. Investors should monitor the $7.82 level upon a price reversal. A rally into this area would likely face resistance from an earlier low at the flattening 100-day SMA.

Ripple, once a leader in the crypto space, now finds its XRP token struggling, with prices dropping below the crucial $2.70 threshold. Unveiling Opportunities: IntelMarkets Gains Traction Despite the regulatory hurdles Ripple faces, some market participants remain optimistic about a favorable outcome in the ongoing Ripple versus SEC litigation, which could potentially uplift XRP prices above the $4 mark. However, impatient investors are exploring alternative opportunities, such as the IntelMarkets (INTL) presale. Amid the prevailing bear market pressures on established cryptocurrencies, IntelMarkets stands out with its potential to revolutionize the $3 trillion global crypto trading market. The presale of IntelMarkets tokens is currently in its ninth stage, boasting a price point of $0.08 and having amassed $9.6 million. XRP's Battle Against Market Dynamics Ripple's decision to release an extensive 400 million tokens has led to significant market fluctuations. Despite efforts to manage token supply, XRP faced a sharp price decline—from over $3 on February 1 to $2.1 by February 3—following the token unlock announcement. Although XRP briefly rebounded to $2.8, it remains subdued around $2.6, notwithstanding some promising news regarding international adoption and technical advancements. The broader market sentiment leans bearish, causing a dip in investor confidence. Still, there is a notable increase in market volume, up by 15%, suggesting the potential for a bullish reversal. Nevertheless, investors seeking higher returns are flocking to the IntelMarkets (INTL) presale, which is generating considerable buzz with its innovative AI-powered trading platform. IntelMarkets: A Game Changer in Crypto Trading In contrast to Ripple's uncertain future, IntelMarkets is carving out a strong reputation in the crypto space.

Top performers like BTC and ETH are also under pressure. It is, therefore not surprising that last year’s top-performing Ripple network is also facing bear pressure as its XRP price dropped under the key support price range of $2.70. Meanwhile, crypto experts still strongly believe that the resolution of the Ripple vs. SEC regulatory case still under litigation will create strong momentum for the XRP price to move over the long-awaited $4 range. However, many Ripple investors are tired of waiting and are moving their holdings to the IntelMarkets (INTL) presale.

The IntelMarkets (INTL) presale is in stage 9 right now with a token price of $0.08, and it has raised $9.6 million so far. Ripple’s XRP Price Unable To Recover From Token Unlock Ripple unlocked a mind-boggling 400 million tokens, and despite reserving the majority of these to control their supply, the XRP price dropped significantly. On February 1, the XRP price was over the $3 price range, and it plunged to $2.1 on February 3 as news of the token unlock was released. Since then, the XRP price has remained under bear pressure and has only managed to reach $2.8 for a brief time before dropping. The current XRP price ranges around $2.6 despite positive news emerging from the SEC side. There is positive news from Ripple’s technical aspects as there is rising international adoption. With the overall market sentiment tending towards the bear side, there is an overall drop in investor confidence and a market decline. The market volume is on the rise right now, up by around 15%, and there are expectations of a bull surge soon.

According to the Federal Reserve President, the central bank may reduce interest rates twice in 2025. However, he expresses considerable uncertainty about the impact of President Donald Trump’s trade and migration policies. Atlanta Federal Reserve President Comments on Interest Rate Cuts According to a recent Reuters report , Raphael Bostic, the President of the Atlanta Federal Reserve, stated that the Fed will lower interest rates twice this year. However, adding uncertainty surrounding the expectations, he highlighted other major factors that could influence the Fed’s decision. “While that’s my baseline expectation, there’s a lot that is going to happen that could influence that really in both directions,” posited Bostic. Further, citing potential changes in trade, immigration, energy, and fiscal policies, he added, “Right now, there is a lot of uncertainty about where some important factors are going to land.” Concluding his view, he added that his current outlook may likely change after six months. Fed President’s View on Strong US Economy Moreover, in an essay today, the Atlanta Federal Reserve President wrote about the central bank’s solid monetary policy and the country’s strong economy. According to Bostic, the current monetary policy is well-positioned. Though he believes the US economy is strong, he doesn’t see the factors as a reason to relax. His statement highlights the uncertainty surrounding the new Trump administration’s policies and moves. His concerns suggest that heightened policy uncertainty could impact the labor market and inflation. Federal Reserve’s Rate Cut and Jerome Powell’s Hawkish Stance Following the Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting at the end of January 2025, Chair Jerome Powell announced the bank’s decision to hold the interest rate unchanged at the 4.25%-4.5% level. The development initially sent the crypto market into a slump, but it has since staged a gradual recovery. Later, on February 12, at his semi-annual monetary report, Powell shared a hawkish approach to interest cuts. He stated that the Fed sees no urgency in altering its policy as the economy remains strong. He added that the policy stance is “less restrictive” than before. Inflation Deemed the Biggest Risk The Atlanta Federal Reserve President considers inflation the biggest risk, despite its recent decline. With the risks to the Fed’s dual mandate now more balanced, he is increasingly focused on achieving 2% inflation without compromising labor market gains. Bostic stated, I still think the biggest risk is inflation. As inflation has come way down, the risks to the mandates have come more into balance and so I’m more sensitive now to the possibility that we could get inflation at 2% without seeing a lot of damage in labor markets. Nonetheless, the Federal Reserve’s next move remains unclear. At the same time, it remains uncertain how it will impact the crypto market. However, if the Fed maintains its hawkish stance , it could potentially trigger a bearish sentiment.

In this evolving landscape, DTX Exchange could stand out as a strong contender. With $14.8 million raised in its bonus presale round and a low entry price of $0.18, DTX is generating massive demand. Many experts believe this could be the top crypto presale of 2025, attracting DOGE whales seeking high-growth potential. Let’s explore more. DTX Exchange Attracts Global Investor Attention As DTX Exchange gears up for expansion into 41 countries, it is rapidly gaining traction as a major force in the crypto market. With a rapidly growing holder base, DTX is positioning itself as a top altcoin for early adopters who are eyeing substantial returns. Speculation is growing around DTX securing a tier-1 exchange listing, a move that could trigger widespread adoption and a sharp rise in trading activity. If confirmed, this milestone would further cement DTX’s status as a top altcoin, with increased demand driving its value upward. With its presale selling out rapidly and excitement building, analysts predict a significant price surge before DTX's exchange debut. Dogecoin whales are betting big on this dual-chain token, further fueling anticipation. As institutional and retail investors take notice, DTX is shaping up to be one of the most promising altcoin investments in the market. DOGE Whales Shift Focus: Is Dogecoin Losing Ground to Utility-Driven Altcoins? The DOGE price recently took a significant hit, prompting investors to question the reasons behind its decline. As of February 18, 2025, the DOGE price is trading above the $0.25 support level, reflecting a drop of over 32% on the 30-day chart. This downturn appears to be driven by shifting market sentiment and the ongoing debate over Dogecoin’s long-term utility. Source: CoinMarketCap Once a top-performing altcoin during its explosive 2021 rally, the DOGE price now faces challenges as investors pivot toward projects with stronger real-world applications. The DOGE price could remain highly sensitive to speculation, and without major developments, it could continue to struggle. In response to the declining DOGE price, many large-scale Dogecoin investors are reallocating their holdings to more stable opportunities. One standout choice among them is the DTX Exchange presale, which is rapidly gaining traction as a promising contender in 2025. This shift highlights how the crypto landscape is evolving, with utility-driven platforms like DTX Exchange providing a strong alternative. DTX Exchange Features That Position It as a Leading Altcoin As the DOGE price declines, DTX, a dual-chain token, is aiming to revolutionize crypto trading with its hybrid model, combining decentralized and centralized elements for superior security and speed. This innovation could make DTX an appealing choice for traders seeking reliability and efficiency in the competitive crypto market. Built on the VulcanX blockchain, DTX Exchange could promise lightning-fast transaction speeds, handling over 200,000 transactions per second. This could ensure seamless trade execution even in high-traffic market conditions. DTX will equip traders with advanced tools such as real-time market analysis, price alerts, and sophisticated charting features. The platform will also offer an automated investment manager, helping long-term investors implement recurring buys and dollar cost averaging (DCA) strategies to better navigate market fluctuations. Additionally, for beginners, DTX will offer a copy trading feature to follow successful strategies and earn profits quickly. With access to 120,000 assets, including crypto, forex, and ETFs, DTX could become a diversified platform for all investors. Source: DTX Exchange With over $14.8 million raised in its bonus presale round, investor interest is surging. With Dogecoin whales betting big on DTX, it could emerge as one of the best crypto presales, potentially outpacing Dogecoin to position itself as a leading altcoin in 2025. Final Thoughts With the DOGE price declining, Dogecoin whales are seeking stable alternatives. DTX Exchange, featuring an innovative dual-chain model, is gaining momentum. Its successful presale attracts both new and seasoned investors, offering a compelling blend of security and speed. Currently, due to high demand, the DTX presale rounds are sold out and now have reached the bonus stage.

Last month, crypto.news reported the foundation sold 200 ETH (worth $672,000) in early 2025, sparking outrage among users like @WazzCrypto on X, who argued the sales erode trust and should fund developers or staking instead. The backlash has reinforced perceptions that the Ethereum Foundation is out of touch, a sentiment the new role aims to address by improving engagement and transparency. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder, defended the sales on X the same day, per crypto.news, citing regulatory pressures and risks of contentious hard forks. He acknowledged community frustration but emphasized the foundation’s focus on long-term sustainability, urging better engagement. These controversies highlight the need for improved communication, which the social media manager’s role targets.

This 15% decrease over the past few days has raised concerns among investors, particularly as Bitcoin also experienced volatility, initially falling to $93,300 after fluctuating near $98,000. Despite these short-term price movements, market analyst Edoardo Farina advises investors to focus on long-term growth rather than reacting to temporary downturns. Price Decline Amid Market Volatility The recent drop in XRP’s value follows an overall downturn in the cryptocurrency market. Recently, the asset surged to $2.83, its highest point in weeks, but has since retreated sharply. This coincided with Bitcoin’s decline, reflecting broader market instability. However, Farina, the founder of Alpha Lions Academy, and a well-known XRP advocate argues that these fluctuations are insignificant when viewed in a long-term investment strategy. Long-Term Perspective Farina urges XRP investors not to be discouraged by short-term price movements, emphasizing that small differences in entry price may not matter in the future. He compared the situation to Bitcoin’s historical performance, noting that those who purchased Bitcoin at $100 or even $300 years ago are seeing substantial returns. He further questions whether purchasing Bitcoin at either of those prices would have made a meaningful difference, given its current value. His argument suggests that whether investors acquire XRP at $1, $2, or even $3, the long-term price potential could make these variations negligible. Farina advises that investors who are confident in the token’s long-term potential should not be discouraged by short-term market declines. Bitcoin’s Past Growth as a Reference Point Bitcoin’s historical performance demonstrates the impact of long-term investment. In 2013, Bitcoin traded at around $100, and today, it has risen to approximately $97,000, delivering an extraordinary 97,000% return. In comparison, XRP has been in the market throughout Bitcoin’s growth and has still provided notable gains for early investors. Currently trading around $2.71, the asset has increased approximately 44 times in value since its early years. While this return is significantly smaller than Bitcoin’s, analysts like Farina remain optimistic about the token’s future price trajectory. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Experts have expressed strong bullish expectations for XRP, with projections that its price could rise substantially in the coming years. Some analysts predict the token could soar to $10,000 per coin, but these projections are extremely speculative and should be treated cautiously. Additionally, some experts have compared its potential to Bitcoin’s historical impact, referring to the token as “ the internet of value. ” Ultimately, Farina’s message to investors is to avoid fixating on short-term price changes. He advises looking beyond temporary market declines and considering the potential for long-term appreciation. If the token follows a path similar to Bitcoin’s, today’s prices may seem insignificant in hindsight. Taking a long-term view can help investors weather cryptocurrency market volatility, avoiding emotional decisions based on short-term price swings or unrealistic expectations.

XRP is generating hype over potential ETF developments, and Cardano is pushing for broader DeFi adoption. Investors watch these three contenders closely as the market prepares for a possible utility-focused surge in Q2 2025. XRP: Will ETF Speculation Drive a Surge? XRP has regained significant attention following news that regulators may approve an exchange-traded fund to its performance. This possibility has fueled speculation that the Ripple price could climb beyond the $5 mark in Q2 2025. Though the coin has been struggling with price in recent days, Source: CoinMarketCap Though the coin has been struggling with price in recent days, analysts believe that if the ETF application moves forward and institutional funds are invested into XRP, the Ripple price may experience one of its most incredible runs in years. However, uncertainty surrounding ongoing regulatory matters can affect XRP. So, some traders will have to step cautiously despite the hype around a possible Ripple price explosion. Cardano: Network Upgrades and DeFi Expansion Meanwhile, Cardano continues to pursue its vision of providing a secure platform for DeFI Apps. After gradually climbing back to $0.80, it must break critical resistance levels to achieve broader price gains. Some experts forecast that the coin may rise to $6 by mid-2025 if network upgrades stimulate DeFi activity. Source: CoinMarketCap Cardano remains well-known for its methodical development approach. However, its slower pace of innovation sometimes creates concerns about whether it can keep pace with more aggressive market leaders. Despite these, Cardano’s community stays optimistic about the platform’s long-term potential. IntelMarkets (INTL): The AI-Powered Contender For Utility Growth IntelMarkets has gained interest by focusing on AI-driven market analysis, quantum-proof security, and a multi-chain infrastructure. Currently, its presale is at $0.09, and it aims to integrate with Ethereum and Solana. Early participants have responded positively, with a significant presale raise already surpassing $10.5 million. Enthusiasts argue that IntelMarkets will surpass the gains seen in the Ripple price if XRP’s potential ETF approval faces delays. The presale will continue until it reaches the next stage, where the token price rises to $0.10. It will offer a window for investors who see more significant potential. The IntelMarkets network will incorporate advanced AI trading bots capable of analyzing thousands of data points in real time and increasing profitability for retail traders. The platform also plans to launch the Quantum X Wallet, which will protect digital assets from threats posed by quantum computing. Which One Will Dominate The Utility Rally In Q2 2025? XRP supporters maintain that a successful XRP ETF launch will trigger a dramatic Ripple price surge, potentially pushing beyond $7. Cardano’s supporters are equally convinced that steady development, new DeFi partnerships, and increased on-chain activity will place ADA on a sustainable path toward $6. IntelMarkets, on the other hand, has the advantage where early entry can produce massive gains. The Presale tokens are still available at a relatively low price, and the platform has enormous room to grow. It will outperform both the Ripple price and Cardano in the coming months. As Q2 2025 approaches, many traders may diversify across all three, yet those willing to bet on the newest technology often see higher returns. Conclusion XRP aims to capitalize on potential ETF approval to create a Ripple price rally. Cardano continues to work to increase DeFi adoption, and IntelMarkets focuses on AI-driven tools that could reshape users' approaches to trading. The utility rally in Q2 2025 will likely depend on each project’s ability to deliver network enhancements and gain real-world use cases. By combining quantum-proof innovation with dual-chain flexibility, IntelMarkets can be the game-changer.

Meanwhile, the longstanding giants, XRP and Cardano, are strategizing to enhance their roles in decentralized finance (DeFi) and other financial arenas. How these endeavors will unfold in Q2 2025 remains a subject of eager speculation. The Ripple Effect: Exploring XRP's Future Potential Ripple's XRP has captivated the attention of investors, fueled by conjectures regarding a potential ETF approval. The implications of such an endorsement could potentially elevate the Ripple price to unprecedented levels, possibly exceeding $7 if successful. However, ongoing regulatory ambiguities continue to hover as a substantial concern for investors. XRP enthusiasts believe that an influx of institutional investments spurred by ETF confirmation could catalyze a significant rally, reminiscent of previous crypto booms. Yet, the unresolved legal skirmishes underscore the need for a cautious approach to trading and investment in Ripple. Cardano's Journey: Slow and Steady Wins the Race? Cardano is charting its course with calculated precision, focusing on scalability and DeFi expansion to fortify its market position. Having recently reached near $0.80, it aims to shatter pivotal price thresholds, potentially climbing to $6 by 2025 if technological upgrades support increased DeFi utilization. While some critique its slow-moving innovation cycle, Cardano's supporters maintain faith in the platform's systematic and thorough development ethos. The community's optimism is rooted in the anticipation of strategic partnerships and enhanced on-chain interactions. IntelMarkets: A New Challenger with AI Advantages As a burgeoning entity, IntelMarkets offers a compelling proposition with its AI-enhanced analytical tools and robust security features. With its presale priced at an enticing $0.09, the platform draws substantial attention from early adopters, boasting a notable presale amount exceeding $10.5 million thus far. The integration of AI trading bots, capable of processing extensive data sets to optimize trade outcomes, positions IntelMarkets as an intriguing competitor. Additionally, the introduction of the Quantum X Wallet intends to safeguard digital assets against potential quantum computing threats, adding a layer of future-proofing to its offerings. Forecasting the Crypto Landscape of Q2 2025 The coming months may witness XRP gaining momentum from regulatory successes or Cardano achieving breakthroughs with network enhancements. However, IntelMarkets' ongoing presale offers a unique entry point for those seeking innovative blockchain applications. Amidst the intense market dynamics, the trajectory of each project towards Q2 2025 will hinge on their ability to translate technological advancements into practical, real-world applications. In this rapidly progressing digital era, adaptability and forward-thinking strategies will be paramount. Wrapping Up Whether it's XRP banking on regulatory green lights, Cardano investing in DeFi longevity, or IntelMarkets leveraging cutting-edge AI solutions, the stage is set for a thrilling phase in cryptocurrency evolution. The ability of these projects to not only innovate but also effectively implement their strategies will determine who leads the market charge in 2025. As always, investors are advised to remain informed and ready to adapt as the crypto landscape continues to transform.

Ver was arrested in Spain following a U.S. Department of Justice indictment alleging the early Bitcoin (BTC) investor committed various tax violations worth $50 million. Federal prosecutors claim Ver underreported his Bitcoin gains and failed to file the correct tax returns. Ver, who renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2014, denied the charges and accused the U.S. of government overreach.

Now Roger needs our support,” Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht tweeted via X.com on Feb. 20. Ulbricht is familiar with America’s justice system, having spent over 11 years in a maximum security prison for his role in the online black market. He was recently freed by a pardon issued by President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, tax allegations against Ver could send the so-called “Bitcoin Jesus” behind bars for up to 20 years. The DOJ slammed Ver with three counts of mail fraud, two counts of tax evasion, and three counts of false tax returns. The mail fraud charges alone each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. “No one should spend the rest of their life in prison over taxes. Let him pay the tax (if any) and be done with it,” said Ulbricht. Crypto lawyer James Murphy, better known as MetaLawMan, agreed with Ulbricht on the matter. Murphy also expected the Justice Department to drop the case. It is unusual for prosecutors to pursue someone for miscalculating their ""exit tax"" 10 yrs after they renounced their citizenship. The prosecution of @rogerkver appears to be part of the Biden admin's coordinated attack on crypto.

Rumors are swirling about a potential gain of 50,000%, capturing the interest of the crypto community. What is this emerging asset, and why are the biggest players so eager to get involved? Discover the details in the following article. DOGEN Soars 500% After DEX Listing, What’s Next with CEX on the Way? DOGEN, the meme token built for those who never settle for less, is showing strong technical and fundamental momentum. Designed for winners, DOGEN embodies the alpha mentality , and this concept has already appealed to a large community of over 30,000 followers on X. Recent Price Action & Momentum Since its listing on Raydium DEX on February 4th, DOGEN had a strong run, hitting an all-time high of $0.0066 before cooling off and stabilizing around $0.002. Even at that level, it’s still up a massive 566% from its lowest presale price of $0.0003. The presale itself raised $5.5 million showing just how much early interest this project attracted. Technical Indicators & Breakout Potential DOGEN’s current fully diluted valuation (FDV) stands at $28 million, with a projected upside toward $40 million. This rise in value suggests a potential price target of $0.004+ in the near term. Recent price action suggests DOGEN is testing key support within a descending channel. If the price breaks above $0.0032, the current downtrend would reverse and set the stage for a strong bullish move toward $0.0056, aligning with previous resistance levels. A planned major exchange listing is expected to inject fresh liquidity and increase accessibility of $DOGEN, typically a key price catalyst for meme coins. With only 1 billion tokens circulating (10% of total supply), DOGEN’s price remains highly sensitive to increased demand , setting the stage for further volatility in favor of the bulls. DOGEN Could 3x From Here – Don’t Wait for the CEX FOMO Community buzzes about DOGEN Hitting $100M+ DOGEN’s remarkable post-listing performance and strong presale momentum have captured significant community attention. The eezzy’s journal channel, boasting over 50K subscribers, has recognized DOGEN’s potential to become a leading memecoin on Solana, potentially reaching a market cap exceeding 100M. DOGEN has already demonstrated its ability to rally quickly, and with increasing speculation ahead of its CEX listing, the probability of retesting its $0.005 ATH—or breaking beyond—is rising. If momentum continues, DOGEN could enter a parabolic price discovery phase, with values exceeding its current FDV ceiling. DOGEN is Still Undervalued – Buy Now Before the CEX Listing Ethereum: Proof-of-Stake Blockchain with Smart Contracts and DeFi Applications Ethereum is a blockchain platform founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015. It introduced smart contracts and a decentralized application ecosystem, including decentralized finance services. Ethereum uses a Proof-of-Stake system, where Ether (ETH) is used for transactions and rewards. In 2022, Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge upgrade. It plans to implement sharding to improve scalability and reduce costs. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon enhance transaction efficiency. Ethereum’s potential lies in its ongoing development and central role in DeFi. Based on historical price movements and BTC halving cycles, Ethereum looks attractive in the current market cycle. Solana’s SOL Coin: Scalability and Potential in Cryptocurrency Solana is a blockchain platform built for speed and scalability. It supports decentralized applications and competes with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano. Solana’s unique design allows for faster transactions without using sharding or second-layer solutions. Developers can build on it using various programming languages. SOL is the native cryptocurrency of Solana. It is used for transactions, running programs, and rewarding network supporters. The coin holds value by powering the Solana ecosystem and giving users access to its projects. In the current market cycle, SOL may be attractive due to its high-capacity network and potential to host high-activity products and services. Conclusion While ETH and SOL may offer limited short-term gains, DOGEN presents a unique opportunity. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN expects 700% growth by presale’s end, with potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. Following tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN is building a community of market leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

Experts predict that this overlooked digital currency might soon outshine well-known favorites like PEPE and SHIB. Discover why this could be the next big thing in the crypto space. DOGEN Explodes 500% – Is This the Next $100M+ Solana Meme Coin? DOGEN is on fire , and if you’re not paying attention, you might be missing out on one of the hottest meme coin runs of 2025. After a 500% surge post-DEX listing , DOGEN is showing serious momentum, and with a CEX listing on the horizon, the bulls are already sharpening their horns. This Solana-based meme token claims to be the go-to choice for alpha investors , and the hype is only getting bigger. DOGEN’s Price Keeps Climbing to Its Peak Since launching on Raydium DEX on February 4th, DOGEN skyrocketed to $0.0066 before cooling off and consolidating around $0.002. Even at this level, it’s still up 566% from its lowest presale price of $0.0003. That’s an insane return for early backers. DOGEN’s presale raised $5.5 million , proving strong early demand. Unlike random meme coins popping up every day, DOGEN has already built a 30,000+ strong community on X , which is a huge sign of long-term engagement. DOGEN’s Next Surge is Coming – Get in Before the Breakout! CEX Listing = FOMO Incoming? Meme coins thrive on hype and accessibility, and a centralized exchange (CEX) listing could be the fuel DOGEN needs for its next leg up. Historically, CEX listings have been massive catalysts for tokens, attracting fresh liquidity and new buyers who missed the presale. The eezzy’s journal channel (50K+ subscribers) has already signaled DOGEN as a potential Solana meme coin leader with a shot at a $100M+ market cap. If that happens, we’re looking at a potential 5x from here. Should You Ape In? DOGEN is showing all the signs of a meme coin that’s about to explode again. Strong fundamentals, a tight supply, an engaged community, and a pending CEX listing make it a high-risk, high-reward play. If you missed the early 500% run, there might still be room to ride the next wave. But once the CEX listing FOMO kicks in, opportunities could dry up fast. DYOR, but don’t say you weren’t warned. Would you go all-in on DOGEN?

Meme coins are known for their strong communities and viral appeal. Dog-themed tokens are especially popular in the cryptocurrency world. WIF focuses on building a fun and engaging community. Built on Solana, it may benefit from Solana’s fast and low-cost transactions. In the current market cycle, WIF could be attractive to those interested in meme coins and community-driven projects. Its unique theme and growing popularity may draw attention. As with all meme coins, its value depends on community interest and adoption. BONK: Solana’s Community-Driven Memecoin with Shiba Inu Mascot BONK is a memecoin built on the Solana blockchain, featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It aims to empower the Solana community by redistributing power from venture capital tokens. BONK surged over 100% after a Coinbase listing and serves as a “community coin,” airdropping 50% of its supply to participants in Solana’s NFT and DeFi sectors. As of mid-December 2023, it became the third-largest memecoin by market cap and one of the top gainers, with a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. BONK’s integration into Solana’s growing ecosystem of decentralized applications, including the launch of BonkSwap, positions it as a notable player in the cryptocurrency space. Its potential lies in community engagement and expanding utility within Solana’s network, making it attractive in the current market cycle. Floki: From Meme Coin to Multifaceted Cryptocurrency Floki is a cryptocurrency that originated from Elon Musk’s 2021 tweet about naming his Shiba Inu “Floki”. Initially a meme coin, it has evolved to focus on utility and charity. Floki aims to offer real-world applications through projects like the NFT metaverse game Valhalla and the DeFi service FlokiFi. Its partnerships, such as with NOWPayments, enable FLOKI tokens to be used in transactions. Floki also contributes to building schools in countries like Laos and Nigeria. The coin’s expanding ecosystem and diversification into NFTs and DeFi make it stand out among meme coins. In the current market cycle, Floki’s ongoing developments and potential utility might interest those looking into emerging cryptocurrencies. AI16Z: Combining AI and Blockchain for Venture Capital Innovation AI16Z is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) launched in October 2024. It integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to improve venture capital investment strategies. An AI agent named “Marc AIndreessen” manages the project, aiming to reduce human biases and inefficiencies found in traditional models. The AI16Z token has governance and utility functions, allowing holders to participate in decision-making and facilitating platform transactions. With a market capitalization exceeding $2 billion, AI16Z reflects strong investor interest. Its alignment with industry trends toward AI automation suggests potential for growth. In the current market cycle, the project’s innovative approach may make it an attractive option for those interested in AI and blockchain integration. Conclusion While WIF, BONK, FLOKI, and AI16Z show less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success. With expected 700% growth by the end of presale and potential for thousand-fold returns, DOGEN is building a community of leaders and offers real benefits to early adopters.

Amidst all this uncertainty, IntelMarkets (INTL) has emerged as a potential rival. This AI altcoin has already raised more than $10.6 million in its presale, with innovative features such as support for dual chains and self-improving trading robots. With a strong foundation and growing investor confidence, IntelMarkets is setting the stage to redefine crypto. Could it outpace the SOL token’s 2021 rally? Let’s understand INTL’s potential. Solana Price Swings: From 2021 Rally to Investor Doubts As of February 17th, the Solana price is around $183, down approximately 20% over the last month. In 2021, the Solana price experienced a remarkable spike, increasing from just $1.50 in January to as much as nearly $260 by September. This surprising surge of the SOL token was fueled by institutional investment, the boom of Solana-based NFTs and DeFi platforms, and its fast, low-cost transactions. These events made the Solana price a compelling option in the crypto market. Source: CoinMarketCap However, the momentum for the SOL token did not persist. Towards the end of 2021, the whole crypto market suffered due to inflation fears, increased interest rates, and regulatory worries. The Solana price was affected by constant network failures, which questioned its stability. The FTX meltdown in late 2022, one of Solana's key supporters, made its fall even more severe, and the SOL token fell below $50 temporarily. Because of such hurdles, investors become increasingly unsure if the network will sustain over time. The fluctuations of the SOL token and heightened rivalry in the crypto market have led some investors to concentrate on other platforms like IntelMarkets which just recently surpassed the $10.6M mark. IntelMarkets: Displaying Immense Potential with a $10.6M Presale IntelMarkets is a cryptocurrency trading platform that employs AI to enhance the trading experience for both new and experienced investors. By February 2025, the presale for the platform surpassed $10.6 million, with the INTL token priced at $0.09 and expected to reach $0.10 in the upcoming phase. IntelMarkets provides Dual-Chain Functionality, with support for Ethereum and Solana blockchains, which could allow users to select their preferred network according to transaction speed and fees. The Intelli-M™ Self-Learning Bots would learn from changing market conditions to make trades based on data analysis and optimize strategies without the need for constant manual intervention. The platform is also launching a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Crypto Trading Module, which may facilitate direct person-to-person transactions among users with support for more than 30 cryptocurrencies. Additionally, IntelMarkets aims to launch a Coin-Margin Derivatives Contracts mechanism for margin trading, with embedded pricing oracles and optimized funding rate computation. It aims to provide fair prices, smooth trading, and efficient risk management. These include characteristics aimed at delivering traders a secure, seamless, and effective trading experience. Could INTL Outpace Solana’s 2021 Rally? While the Solana price’s remarkable rise in 2021 has mostly abated, IntelMarkets seems to be on a strong path to replicate or even surpass that momentum. The token supply of IntelMarkets is limited to 2,000,000,000 tokens only. If it hits even 1% of Solana’s market capitalization, the new token price would be $0.44, and early investors could gain a massive 450% return on initial investment. The staggering presale numbers of more than $10.6 million and initial investors already enjoying returns hint that INTL may be ready for exponential growth. With continued momentum, the INTL coin may enjoy a rally similar to the SOL token’s 2021 run. Conclusion The Solana price's downfall following its 2021 surge is an indication of the danger of investing in platforms that lack long-term stability. Although the future of the SOL token is uncertain, IntelMarkets is making huge waves, having garnered more than $10.6 million in presale. With impressive early returns and a highly innovative platform, IntelMarkets offers a rare opportunity for investors to enter early before token prices rise further. Priced at $0.09, now is the perfect time to secure INTL tokens at a competitive rate, potentially capitalizing on a rally that could outpace the SOL token’s 2021 surge.

However, with notable setbacks like network failures and the collapse of FTX, Solana faced significant challenges. During this turmoil, IntelMarkets (INTL) has surfaced, drawing attention with its innovative AI-driven platform and impressive presale performance, raising more than $10.6 million. A New Contender in the Crypto World: IntelMarkets In a market shadowed by volatility, IntelMarkets aims to differentiate itself through advanced technologies and strategic blockchain integration. Offering dual-chain compatibility with Ethereum and Solana, this AI-centric platform seeks to enhance trading efficiency with self-improving algorithms and a broad spectrum of trading options. One of the standout features includes the Intelli-M™ Self-Learning Bots, designed to continuously adapt to market trends and optimize trading strategies without requiring constant human oversight. Coupled with a P2P trading module, it promises an expansive, user-friendly experience across over 30 cryptocurrencies. The Rollercoaster of Solana The year 2021 saw Solana soaring from its humble beginnings to dizzying heights, reaching a value peak that caught the attention of investors worldwide. Its appeal lay in its speed and cost-effectiveness, bolstered by a surge in DeFi and NFT applications built on its blockchain. But with success came scrutiny, and network instability alongside external market pressures soon tested Solana's resilience. Amid inflationary concerns and regulatory challenges, Solana's value saw a sharp decline, exacerbated by the demise of FTX, a crucial supporter. Investors were left questioning its long-term viability, sparking a search for alternative investment opportunities like IntelMarkets. IntelMarkets: Positioned for Growth? With a capped token supply of 2 billion and a presale that has already demonstrated considerable traction, IntelMarkets offers an enticing proposition. Should it capture even a fraction of Solana's market capitalization, the potential returns are substantial. Investors eyeing the current price of $0.09 see a window of opportunity that promises significant gains. Conclusion: Navigating the Future While Solana's past performance provides a cautionary tale about the risks inherent in crypto investments, IntelMarkets presents a vision of what could be possible with strategic innovation and robust early investment. As IntelMarkets continues to gain momentum, it stands ready to challenge the status quo, offering potential for substantial returns and a fresh narrative in the crypto landscape.

The Truth Hurts—Meanwhile, Dogen Is Gearing Up for a 15,000% Surge!",https://nulltx.com/shiba-inu-to-1-the-truth-hurts-meanwhile-dogen-is-gearing-up-for-a-15000-surge/,"The crypto world is buzzing with debates about Shiba Inu’s chances of hitting the $1 mark, but the prospects might not be as bright as hoped. Meanwhile, Dogen is emerging from the shadows, poised for a potential 15,000% surge. This unexpected contender could be the next big player to shake up the market. DOGEN Soars 500% After DEX Listing, What’s Next with CEX on the Way? DOGEN, the meme token built for those who never settle for less, is showing strong technical and fundamental momentum. Designed for winners, DOGEN embodies the alpha mentality , and this concept has already appealed to a large community of over 30,000 followers on X. Recent Price Action & Momentum Since its listing on Raydium DEX on February 4th, DOGEN had a strong run, hitting an all-time high of $0.0066 before cooling off and stabilizing around $0.002. Even at that level, it’s still up a massive 566% from its lowest presale price of $0.0003. The presale itself raised $5.5 million showing just how much early interest this project attracted. Technical Indicators & Breakout Potential DOGEN’s current fully diluted valuation (FDV) stands at $28 million, with a projected upside toward $40 million. This rise in value suggests a potential price target of $0.004+ in the near term. Recent price action suggests DOGEN is testing key support within a descending channel. If the price breaks above $0.0032, the current downtrend would reverse and set the stage for a strong bullish move toward $0.0056, aligning with previous resistance levels. A planned major exchange listing is expected to inject fresh liquidity and increase accessibility of $DOGEN, typically a key price catalyst for meme coins. With only 1 billion tokens circulating (10% of total supply), DOGEN’s price remains highly sensitive to increased demand , setting the stage for further volatility in favor of the bulls. DOGEN Could 3x From Here – Don’t Wait for the CEX FOMO Community buzzes about DOGEN Hitting $100M+ DOGEN’s remarkable post-listing performance and strong presale momentum have captured significant community attention. The eezzy’s journal channel, boasting over 50K subscribers, has recognized DOGEN’s potential to become a leading memecoin on Solana, potentially reaching a market cap exceeding 100M. DOGEN has already demonstrated its ability to rally quickly, and with increasing speculation ahead of its CEX listing, the probability of retesting its $0.005 ATH—or breaking beyond—is rising. If momentum continues, DOGEN could enter a parabolic price discovery phase, with values exceeding its current FDV ceiling. DOGEN is Still Undervalued – Buy Now Before the CEX Listing Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Its Role in the Crypto Market Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. It was created in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi. SHIB originally had a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, with half sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. He later donated and burned a large portion, reducing the circulating supply. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB is compatible with Ethereum-based projects. It supports applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and has plans for an NFT platform and DAO governance. Its integration with Ethereum gives it more potential for development. SHIB’s popularity and community support make it an interesting option in the crypto market, though its long-term value depends on adoption and ecosystem growth. Conclusion While SHIB and others may have limited short-term growth, DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success. With an expected 700% growth by the end of its presale and potential thousand-fold returns this altcoin season, DOGEN follows in the footsteps of BONK, WIF, and Popcat, aiming for record-breaking success and building a community of market leaders.

With the potential for significant returns, investors are keen to pinpoint digital assets that could lead the charge. This article uncovers five cryptocurrencies poised for remarkable growth. Discover which coins might offer exceptional opportunities in the forthcoming market surge. DOGEN Explodes 500% – Is This the Next $100M+ Solana Meme Coin? DOGEN is on fire , and if you’re not paying attention, you might be missing out on one of the hottest meme coin runs of 2025. After a 500% surge post-DEX listing , DOGEN is showing serious momentum, and with a CEX listing on the horizon, the bulls are already sharpening their horns. This Solana-based meme token claims to be the go-to choice for alpha investors , and the hype is only getting bigger. DOGEN’s Price Keeps Climbing to Its Peak Since launching on Raydium DEX on February 4th, DOGEN skyrocketed to $0.0066 before cooling off and consolidating around $0.002. Even at this level, it’s still up 566% from its lowest presale price of $0.0003. That’s an insane return for early backers. DOGEN’s presale raised $5.5 million , proving strong early demand. Unlike random meme coins popping up every day, DOGEN has already built a 30,000+ strong community on X , which is a huge sign of long-term engagement. DOGEN’s Next Surge is Coming – Get in Before the Breakout! CEX Listing = FOMO Incoming? Meme coins thrive on hype and accessibility, and a centralized exchange (CEX) listing could be the fuel DOGEN needs for its next leg up. Historically, CEX listings have been massive catalysts for tokens, attracting fresh liquidity and new buyers who missed the presale. The eezzy’s journal channel (50K+ subscribers) has already signaled DOGEN as a potential Solana meme coin leader with a shot at a $100M+ market cap. If that happens, we’re looking at a potential 5x from here. Should You Ape In? DOGEN is showing all the signs of a meme coin that’s about to explode again. Strong fundamentals, a tight supply, an engaged community, and a pending CEX listing make it a high-risk, high-reward play. If you missed the early 500% run, there might still be room to ride the next wave. But once the CEX listing FOMO kicks in, opportunities could dry up fast. DYOR, but don’t say you weren’t warned. Would you go all-in on DOGEN? Kaspa: A Fast Proof-of-Work Cryptocurrency Kaspa is a digital currency that uses proof-of-work for security. It operates on a blockDAG instead of a single chain. The GHOSTDAG protocol allows multiple blocks to exist together instead of discarding them. This design helps Kaspa process transactions quickly. The network currently produces 1 block per second, with plans to increase speed. Kaspa includes features like efficient data storage, quick transaction validation, and support for future improvements. Its fast processing and secure structure could make it appealing. The market attractiveness depends on adoption and competition. TRX: Blockchain Platform for Digital Content and dApps TRX is the native cryptocurrency of the TRON network, a blockchain platform launched in 2017. It was originally based on Ethereum but later moved to its own blockchain. TRON aims to give content creators full control over their work, reducing reliance on intermediaries like YouTube and Facebook. Users can directly reward creators through the network. TRON supports smart contracts and decentralized applications. It uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin, allowing transparent tracking of operations. The platform offers low fees and fast transactions, making it a competitive alternative to Ethereum. TRX remains relevant in the market due to its focus on a decentralized Internet and digital content monetization. Fetch.AI: AI-Powered Decentralized Network with Crypto Economy Fetch.AI was founded in 2017 and launched on Binance in 2019. It develops a decentralized network that integrates artificial intelligence and blockchain. The platform allows users to access secure data and automate tasks through AI. Fetch.AI’s technology supports various applications, including DeFi trading, transportation, and energy management. The price of FET is projected to range between $0.808541 and $1.024293 in 2025. By 2030, estimates suggest it could fluctuate between $0.601469 and $1.190916. If the price reaches the upper target, this could represent a 39.51% increase from today’s value. Fetch.AI’s focus on AI and automation makes it an interesting option in the current market cycle. JasmyCoin and Its Role in a Decentralized Data Economy JasmyCoin (JASMY) is a digital asset of Jasmy Corporation, a Japanese IoT company. The project combines blockchain and IoT technology to allow individuals to control and monetize their data. Jasmy aims to create a secure environment for data exchange among IoT devices, reducing reliance on centralized data servers. It uses edge computing and IPFS for decentralized data storage. The project promotes a model where users own their information while businesses can access data transparently. The demand for data security and ownership continues to grow, which may impact JASMY’s adoption. The coin’s potential depends on how well it integrates with real-world businesses and the broader acceptance of decentralized data solutions. Conclusion While KAS, TRX, FET, and JASMY may offer limited short-term gains, DOGEN stands out for those seeking excellence. With an expected 700% growth before the presale ends and potential for massive returns, DOGEN follows the path of successful tokens like BONK and Popcat. It builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early supporters.

DOGEN is Still Undervalued – Buy Now Before the CEX Listing Solana and the Role of SOL in Blockchain Development Solana is a blockchain platform designed for high-speed transactions and scalability. It supports decentralized applications and competes with networks like Ethereum and Cardano. Solana uses a unique architecture to increase transaction capacity without sharding or second-layer solutions. SOL is the native cryptocurrency, used for transaction fees, running smart contracts, and rewarding network participants. The platform aims to attract developers with its speed and flexibility. SOL is integral to the ecosystem, providing access to various projects. Its potential depends on adoption and market conditions.

40599706,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=678167,1740079800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40599706.jpeg,3 Must-Have Cryptos for the Next Bull Run,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/3-must-have-cryptos-for-the-next-bull-run/,"The cryptocurrency market is heating up, and investors are racing to identify tokens poised for explosive growth. Among thousands of options, three stand out: XRP, Solana (SOL), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Each offers unique value, but one is already making headlines for its presale performance and unmatched profit potential. With Mutuum Finance’s first presale phase 75% sold and $831,568.80 raised, early backers are positioning themselves for a 600% return at launch, and experts predict a 100x surge to $1 in 2025. Here’s why these three cryptocurrencies deserve immediate attention. XRP’s Bullish Chart Pattern Sparks Optimism XRP is capturing attention as a technical analysis favorite. A classic Cup and Handle pattern has formed on its price chart, a signal often preceding major breakouts. The pattern’s rounded “cup” reflects a period of consolidation, while the smaller “handle” suggests a final dip before upward momentum. Analysts like Ali Martinez highlight $2.80 as the critical resistance level. Breaking this barrier could propel XRP to $3.35, a 28.8% jump from its current price. Recent performance supports this optimism. Despite a 14% monthly drop, XRP has rebounded with a 9.6% weekly gain, signaling renewed buyer interest. While regulatory hurdles remain, the token’s utility in cross-border payments and its loyal investor base keep it in contention for the next bull run. Solana ETFs Fuel Institutional Interest Solana is emerging as a regulatory breakthrough story. The SEC has begun reviewing applications for Solana-based ETFs from major firms like VanEck and Grayscale, a move unthinkable just months ago. This shift follows political changes, including the appointment of crypto-friendly SEC Chair Paul Atkins, and hints at accelerated approvals. JPMorgan estimates these ETFs could attract $3 billion to $6 billion within their first year, driving SOL’s price to $550 by late 2025. Currently trading at $163, Solana faces technical challenges. Its 50-day and 200-day moving averages hover near $215, and a recent “death cross” signals short-term bearish pressure. However, the ETF news has overshadowed these concerns. A successful breakout above $220 could reignite bullish momentum, making SOL a high-risk, high-reward play for patient investors. Mutuum Finance Presale Dominates Market Conversations While XRP and Solana attract speculative interest, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is where actionable opportunity lies. The decentralized lending platform has ignited a presale frenzy, raising over $831,568.80 from 1,500 holders in Phase 1 alone. Priced at $0.01, MUTM offers a guaranteed 600% return at its $0.06 launch price, a mathematical certainty, not a projection. But the real story is its post-launch potential: analysts unanimously forecast a climb to $1 in 2025, turning a $1,000 investment into $100,000. Mutuum Finance isn’t relying on hype. Its ecosystem combines peer-to-peer lending, overcollateralized stablecoins, and a token-burning mechanism designed to create permanent price growth. The platform’s beta launch will coincide with its exchange debut, ensuring immediate utility and user adoption. Additionally, a $100,000 giveaway is fueling community growth, with participants rushing to secure their stake before Phase 1 sells out. Why Mutuum Finance Outshines the Competition Unlike XRP and Solana, Mutuum Finance eliminates guesswork. Its presale structure guarantees early investors a 6x return, while its tokenomics ensure long-term demand. Every loan transaction on the platform triggers a buyback of MUTM tokens, redistributing them to stakers and steadily reducing supply. This built-in scarcity, paired with real-world DeFi utility, creates a perfect storm for price appreciation.

Javier’s visit—scheduled weeks in advance—was originally about securing an International Monetary Fund (IMF) deal and strengthening ties with Donald Trump’s administration. But now, Javier is walking into a different battle: explaining his involvement in a memecoin collapse that erased $4.6 billion in market value overnight. Javier’s US itinerary is stacked. He’s set to meet Elon Musk, one of his most vocal supporters and a close friend, before delivering a speech at CPAC—the Trump-friendly Conservative Political Action Conference. His team has been scrambling to turn the conversation away from the $LIBRA debacle and back to his economic agenda. But back in Argentina, the scandal isn’t going away. $LIBRA token collapses after Javier’s promotion The controversy exploded last Friday when Javier personally endorsed $LIBRA, a newly launched cryptocurrency, in a post on X (formerly Twitter). The token immediately surged, attracting speculators who saw the Argentine president’s backing as a signal to buy in. But just hours later, the price crashed, wiping out billions. Javier deleted the post, and his office distanced itself from the project, but it was already too late. Then came Hayden Davis, a key figure behind the token. Hayden told investors that Javier was more involved than he let on, claiming in leaked text messages —published by CoinDesk—that he paid Karina Javier, the president’s sister and closest advisor, to “control” Javier. Davis denied that he had made any payments to the president or his sister, or sent the messages. Milei denied any wrongdoing in a television interview on Monday. But the damage was done. The opposition pounced, accusing Javier of either incompetence or outright corruption. Javier responded on Monday night in an interview on Argentinian television, saying he never received money for the promotion and calling the accusations an attempt to smear his presidency. He didn’t clarify why he initially backed the token or why he deleted the post, leaving more questions than answers. Market reaction and the IMF talks in Washington The fallout hit Argentina’s markets hard. The Buenos Aires stock index dropped 6% on Monday before recovering slightly. The country’s already fragile peso took another hit, adding pressure on Javier’s economic team. Javier’s biggest priority in Washington is securing an IMF deal. His government has been in negotiations for months, trying to unlock new funding and ease Argentina’s currency controls. Economy Minister Luis Caputo said on Monday that the agreement was “almost done”, but sources close to the talks suggest the IMF still has concerns—particularly about Javier’s handling of the peso’s exchange rate. The IMF has pushed for a more flexible currency policy, but Javier’s team insists on controlling the rate to prevent inflation from spiraling further. While Javier has been one of Trump’s strongest allies on the global stage, the US president’s new tariff plan could put Argentina in a difficult position. Trump is pushing for reciprocal levies on countries that impose heavy duties on US goods, and Argentina’s protectionist trade policies could make it a target. Javier is expected to raise concerns about the tariffs when he meets with top US officials this week. His government has been trying to align more closely with Washington, but trade policy could strain the relationship—even as Javier cultivates personal ties with Trump’s inner circle. Despite the scandal back home, Javier is set to receive a warm welcome at CPAC. The conservative crowd embraces his free-market stance and aggressive anti-establishment rhetoric. Last year, Javier’s speech at the same event went viral among right-wing circles, and his team is betting on another strong reception to help drown out the crypto controversy. Before CPAC, Javier is scheduled to meet Elon Musk. Musk has been one of his biggest defenders, calling him a “true reformer” and backing his aggressive economic policies. Their meeting is expected to focus on energy, trade, and digital assets. Crypto will almost certainly come up—but whether Musk addresses the $LIBRA debacle remains to be seen. The crypto community, meanwhile, has been divided over the scandal. One Argentinian X user posted: “ The main thing I can say after $LIBRA incident is that I believe even more in Bitcoin and Ethereum than even before and I’m sure Argentineans will play a crucial role in global crypto adoption. We’re resilient as fuck. ” Ethereum created Vitalik Buterin reacted , saying: “Argentina’s Ethereum community is full of amazing builders, who have already contributed some of the most important software in the Ethereum ecosystem.” He suggested that Argentina should host Devconnect, a major Ethereum developer conference, citing the country’s strong crypto talent. Javier responded publicly: “THANK YOU VERY MUCH, Vitalik Buterin FOR YOUR WORDS ABOUT ARGENTINE TALENT!!! It would be an honor for Argentina to host Devconnect.

Analytics Company Shares Its Special Metric,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-the-current-bitcoin-price-cheap-or-expensive-analytics-company-shares-its-special-metric/,"Cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal has examined the current valuation of Bitcoin using the Short-Term Flow Fair Value metric and clarified whether BTC is cheap or expensive in the current market conditions. The Short-Term Flow Fair Value metric measures the relationship between new Bitcoin issuance and its absorption by the market. It takes into account the following: BTC inflows and outflows on exchanges affecting trading liquidity. Miner supply as miners frequently sell BTC to cover operational expenses. Transaction fees play a role in supply and demand dynamics. A high Short-Term Flow Fair Value indicates that more BTC is being absorbed by the market, reducing selling pressure and potentially supporting the price. Conversely, a drop in this metric indicates that more coins are entering the market via exchanges and miner sales, increasing selling pressure. Related News: Another Cryptocurrency-Friendly Decision from the New SEC - Erasing the Traces of the Old One by One Alphractal notes that the metric reached an all-time high in February but has recently started to fall. However, it remains high, indicating that Bitcoin’s absorption levels are still strong despite the recent pullback. In addition to Short-Term Flow Fair Value, Alphractal also notes the Aggregate Funding Rate across exchanges. It is currently approaching negative territory but remains positive overall. Negative funding rates across major exchanges have historically been associated with local bottoms, suggesting a shift in market sentiment may be on the horizon. *This is not investment advice.

By the end of that year, its price had climbed from an opening value of $0.000000000073 to $0.000034. At its peak, SHIB reached an all-time high of $0.00008616, reflecting an even more remarkable 118,000,000% increase. Since then, the market has undergone a significant downturn. As of report time, the asset trades at $0.00001536, approximately 82% below its record high. Given its sharp decline , many investors are eager to know when the token could reclaim its previous peak. OpenAI’s ChatGPT has provided three potential scenarios based on market trends, historical price cycles, and ongoing developments within the ecosystem. Conservative Projection: 2028–2030 Under a scenario where the token’s recovery is driven by organic adoption rather than speculative hype, ChatGPT estimates that the memecoin may not reach its all-time high again until between 2028 and 2030. This outlook assumes that SHIB’s growth will primarily depend on continued development within its ecosystem, particularly the adoption of Shibarium, its Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution. A steady increase in real-world usage and utility within the ecosystem would serve as the key drivers for long-term value appreciation. Moderate Projection: 2025–2026 If the cryptocurrency market experiences a strong bullish cycle, the asset could potentially recover more quickly. ChatGPT predicts that in a scenario where Bitcoin surges to a price range of $150,000 to $200,000, SHIB could return to its all-time high between 2025 and 2026. In this case, the token’s growth would likely be influenced by broader market momentum, with altcoins following Bitcoin’s lead . Additional contributing factors would include increased token burns, which reduce supply, and greater adoption of Shibarium, further strengthening the ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Optimistic Projection: Early 2025 ChatGPT’s most aggressive estimate suggests that the asset could reach its all-time high as early as the beginning of 2025. This scenario would require a combination of factors, including a strong bull market, heightened speculative interest, large-scale token burns, and substantial buy volume. However, given current market conditions as of February 20, 2025, this outlook appears increasingly unlikely as the token approaches a death cross. While SHIB has yet to reclaim its 2021 peak, its future trajectory will depend on market cycles, adoption trends, and ecosystem developments. If a strong bull market materializes and key catalysts such as Shibarium adoption and token burns accelerate, SHIB may reach its all-time high sooner rather than later. However, if growth continues at a slow pace, a longer recovery period should be expected. Ultimately, predicting the exact timeline remains speculative, but market participants will be closely monitoring the token’s progress to determine whether it can achieve another historic rally.

S&P noted that a regulatory framework could increase stablecoin adoption in the U.S. and help close the gap with Europe, where the markets in crypto-assets regulation came into force in mid-2024. The S&P report highlighted the details of three proposals that were currently under consideration as the debate on stablecoin regulation in the U.S. raged on. According to the report, each of the three proposals sets strict requirements for stablecoin issuers, including maintaining sufficient stablecoin reserves backed by cash and treasuries with maturity that is less than three months. The stablecoin reserves should also be backed by insured deposits and repurchase agreements (repos) with less than seven days’ maturity that are also backed by reverse repos, treasury bills with less than three months’ maturity, and central bank reserves. Stablecoin issuers were also required to ‘segregate between the underlying assets of the stablecoin and their assets’, disclose the redemption policy, and publish monthly compositions of the reserves, which are to be examined by a registered public accounting firm. Other requirements include maintaining a certain capital level that will ensure sufficient liquidity and meeting certain standards when managing risks related to interest rates, operations, compliance, and information technology. Report suggests regulation proposals differ on the State and Federal level S&P reports steady growth of $USDT and $USDC in the crypto market but asserts U.S. stablecoin adoption is slowed by lack of regulation. A clear guidance is urgently needed for full potential unleashing. — Alfa AI (@AlfaTerminal) February 20, 2025 The S&P Global report mentioned that the three proposals differed on whether and when an issuer was regulated at the federal level or the state level. As per the report, one proposal stipulated that the office of the comptroller of the currency should supervise stablecoins with underlying assets of at least $10 billion if the issuer was not a bank. However, smaller stablecoin issuers could opt for state regulations if they were closely similar to the proposed federal regulation. The report clarified that this would be subject to approval by the treasury secretary. S&P also disclosed that the other proposals required the treasury secretary and other regulators to conduct a study on endogenously collateralized stablecoins (ECS) and demand a ‘two-year moratorium’ for the issuance of ECS. The S&P team believes that stablecoins will play an increasingly important role in on-chain transactions to protect savings from local monetary instability in emerging markets or to receive remittances. The report claimed that USD-pegged coins continued to dominate the stablecoin industry, although tokenized money market funds with stablecoin subscription and redemption mechanisms had recently emerged. The market capitalization of stablecoins increased to $230 billion as of February 15th, up from about $160 billion six months ago. S&P expects increased stablecoins adoption among institutions According to the S&P report, the lack of regulation and supervision in the U.S. has prevented a broader institutional adoption of stablecoins, especially for financial transactions and digital bond issuances. S&P forecasts that some users are likely to transition progressively from unregulated to regulated stablecoins, thus changing the current industry landscape. The study on ECS could also tighten regulations on the use of ECS once it is complete. The report stated that the role of stablecoins will continue to evolve and could eventually lead to more integration between traditional finance and decentralized finance. The lack of an agreement about the tools that should be used to bring money natively on-chain was among the main factors that hindered the development of digital bonds and RWA tokenization. S&P pointed out that jurisdictions like the EU, Hong Kong, and Singapore were leading with comprehensive approaches for their regions while the U.S. continued to deliberate on federal legislation. Important matters such as reserve transparency, issuer solvency, and the ability to redeem stablecoins for their pegged value were critical to safeguarding consumers.

The SEC says the new Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit (CETU) will replace the old Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. CETU says it will “combat misconduct” relating to securities in the areas of emerging technologies fraud, social media and dark web fraud, hacking, brokerage account takeovers, crypto fraud, cybersecurity compliance, and cybersecurity fraud. D’Allaird is an attorney who has served as Senior Counsel in the SEC’s Cyber Unit Enforcement Division. Said Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda of the new unit, “Importantly, the new unit will also allow the SEC to deploy enforcement resources judiciously. The unit will not only protect investors but will also facilitate capital formation and market efficiency by clearing the way for innovation to grow. It will root out those seeking to misuse innovation to harm investors and diminish confidence in new technologies.” One of CETU’s aims will be to combat crypto fraud by complementing the work of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Hester Pierce. Earlier this week, Pierce sent out a warning to memecoin traders – if things go wrong, the SEC might not bail them out. “Just because something is out there and it’s popular does not mean that it will fit within the SEC jurisdiction.

In a statement, the DOJ says that Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turõgin sold contracts that entitled their customers to a share of the cryptocurrency mined by their purported crypto mining service, HashFlare. Court documents show that from 2015 to 2019, HashFlare made over $577 million in sales despite not having the computing capacity needed for most of the mining that the defendants claimed it performed. HashFlare’s web-based platform, which was supposed to show customers their mining profits, also reflected falsified data. The DOJ says Potapenko and Turõgin used the proceeds of the scheme to buy luxury cars and real estate, as well as maintain investment and cryptocurrency accounts. On February 12th, both men pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which is punishable by up to 20 years in prison. As part of their guilty plea, the duo agreed to forfeit assets valued at over $400 million, which will be available for a remission process to compensate victims of their fraud scheme. A federal district court judge will issue the sentence on May 8th.

Clarifying that Bybit has no plans to list the PI token, the Bybit CEO questioned the project’s legitimacy. Meanwhile, the PI token’s value plummeted by over 55% in a single day, causing alarm among investors. Despite its initial popularity, the token’s downward spiral has raised concerns about its long-term viability. Pi Network Is a Scam, Says Bybit CEO Bybit CEO Ben Zhou has publicly voiced his skepticism about the Pi Network’s legitimacy, calling it a scam. In a recent X post , Zhou explicitly stated that Bybit will not list the PI token, reaffirming his doubts about its authenticity. He stated, “I still think you are a scam, and no , Bybit will not list scam.” Referring to a 2021 warning from the People’s Government of Hengyang, Zhou pointed out that the Chinese Police deemed Pi Network as a scam targeting elderly folks. According to reports, the government has issued a warning against Pi Network’s alleged plans to misuse the public’s personal data to accumulate pension funds. The Bybit CEO added, “There are multiple other reports out there questioning the project legitimacy.” Bybit Has No Plans to List PI Token Reiterating his previous stance, Ben Zhou stated that Bybit is not listing the Pi token, due to scam concerns. In a previous post, he dismissed rumors of Bybit listing the Pi token, with a message in Chinese. The post is translated as, A bunch of people asked me today if I wanted to list Pi. I said, ‘Stop being ridiculous.’ Back when I was trading forex, I was constantly confronted by middle-aged people demanding their hard-earned money back. I really don’t want to deal with that in the crypto space—so I’m keeping my distance. Thanks In the recent thread, Zhou confirmed that Bybit hasn’t submitted a listing request for the PI token. He reiterated that allegations of PI turning down Bybit’s listing or failing the exchange’s KYB verification process are unfounded. Further questioning the project’s legitimacy, Zhou stated, “If the project is legitimate and straight up, then you should come forth and address these report so everyone can understand , but instead you choose to make up shit and do these childish attack with no ground.” Notably, Binance is currently conducting a community poll to gauge interest in listing Pi. So far, the majority of voters are in favor of adding the coin to the platform. PI Plummets: What’s Next? Despite the initial hype, Pi Network’s PI token has plummeted by a massive 59.58% over the last 24 hours. However, traders remain optimistic about the token which is evident from the staggering 2833% surge in its trading volume. At press time, the PI token is trading in the red zone, at a price of $0.7806, significantly down from the high of $1.99. However, driven by the initial parabolic uptrend, analysts remain bullish. As per Pi price prediction , the token is poised to hit $300 driven by potential listings by major exchanges.

Here’s how the trend has compared for Shiba Inu and other memecoins. Dogecoin Has Witnessed A Decline In Open Interest Recently In a new post on X, the analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the latest trend in the Open Interest for the various memecoins in the cryptocurrency sector. The “Open Interest” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of positions related to a given asset currently open on all derivatives exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin RHODL Momentum Slowing Down—Analyst Warns Pattern ‘Not Ideal’ First, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day moving average (MA) of the metric for Dogecoin, the original meme-based token: As is visible in the above graph, the 7-day MA of the Dogecoin Open Interest had a value of $3.5 billion in December, but since then, speculative interest around the asset has plummeted as it has come down to just $1.49 billion today. This represents a decrease of around 58.4%. DOGE isn’t the only memecoin that has gone through a futures flush in this period, however, as the second chart shared by the analytics firm shows. From the graph, it’s apparent that Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), and dogwifhat (WIF) have all seen a cooldown in Open Interest during the last couple of months. The decline has even been more pronounced than DOGE’s for all of these, as the metric has fallen by more than 69% for them. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Floki (FLOKI) have likewise followed suit, with the indicator declining by 74% and 69%, respectively. While speculative activity on the futures market has taken the deep dive across the memecoins, it appears the trend has been different for other parts of the cryptocurrency sector. Related Reading: Ethereum Fees Back To Lowest Since August: Is This Bullish? Here is a chart that the analytics firm has shared in another X post, which shows how the percentage change in the Open Interest has compared between meme-based assets and three of the top coins (Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL)): As displayed in the above graph, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana have registered a drop of 11%, 23%, and 6% on the metric, respectively. Clearly, this is significantly less than the 52% crash that the memecoin market combined has observed. DOGE Price Dogecoin has been locked in sideways movement during the last couple of weeks as its price is still trading around $0.25.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $4.66 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $14.78. Tezos started out really strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Following the November 5 U.S. elections and the emergence of ex-president Donald Trump, crypto markets have responded positively, with Bitcoin prices moving above the $100k mark. Tezos also responded similarly, hitting a high of $1.85. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.88 Market cap $916,020,841.7 Trading volume $24,815,327.21 Circulating supply 1,031,075,043.67 XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour low $0.8647 24-hour high $0.8902 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 12.94% 50-day SMA $1.122 14-Day RSI 36.71 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-day SMA $0.958 Tezos price analysis: Will XTZ surge past $0.9 soon?

XTZ’s value is currently around $0.888, making attempts to break past the 20-day SMA, suggesting growing buyer interest. XTZ to surge past its 20-day SMA? The MACD indicator, with a bullish crossover, also confirms the growing buying pressure observed on the chart. The RSI (36.05) reflects a market approaching oversold conditions. With the slight bullish signal from other indicators, the RSI’s position suggests buyer opportunities at a discount. If buyer interest persists, XTZ could surge past $0.950. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: Buying pressure is present for XTZ The 4-hour chart shows recovery for XTZ, with the coin trading above the middle Bollinger Band. The Bollinger Bands are broadening, suggesting potential volatility in the short term and possible price swings. Buying pressure is present for XTZ The CMF indicator shows some capital inflow, meaning buyers are stepping in. On the other hand, the MFI suggests a balance between sellers and buyers, indicating room for more upside before an overbought condition is reached. If XTZ fails to stay above $0.869, it might move toward lower support levels. To confirm a recovery, XTZ must break above $0.901. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $1.006 SELL SMA 5 $0.965 SELL SMA 10 $0.959 SELL SMA 21 $0.935 SELL SMA 50 $1.122 SELL SMA 100 $1.211 SELL SMA 200 $0.958 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.975 SELL EMA 5 $1.048 SELL EMA 10 $1.153 SELL EMA 21 $1.247 SELL EMA 50 $1.264 SELL EMA 100 $1.152 SELL EMA 200 $1.028 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? XTZ has seen some gain in the recent trading hours, closing in on its 20-day SMA, which it needs to clear to strengthen the upside. With the capital inflow observed in the short term, the price could trend higher and may even break past $0.901 and higher levels. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs – so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your own research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos up? Tezos (XTZ) is up today after rebounding around the $0.8646 support level, a move spurred by slight buyer interest. XTZ price history Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin made some recovery in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024 despite the partnership milestones achieved. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ reached a maximum price of $1.49, but in February, it’s in the red zone, trading between $0.8647 and $0.8852.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|XTZ|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-20 19:51:42

The price has struggled to establish a clear trend, with bulls attempting to push higher while bears hold firm at key resistance levels. This prolonged phase of sideways movement suggests that ETH is gearing up for its next big move—but the direction remains uncertain. Periods of consolidation often act as a springboard for significant price swings, making it crucial to watch the key support and resistance zones closely. A breakout above resistance could ignite bullish momentum, while a drop below support might trigger a fresh wave of selling pressure. With market sentiment shifting and external factors influencing price action, Ethereum’s next move could be just around the corner. Current Price Action And Technical Indicators Ethereum’s price action remains in a consolidation phase, with neither bulls nor bears establishing a clear trend. The market is showing signs of reduced volatility, indicating a breakout may be on the horizon. ETH is trading within a defined range, testing key support and resistance levels that will determine its next move. Related Reading: Ethereum Fees Back To Lowest Since August: Is This Bullish? Technical indicators provide mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers near a neutral zone, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. Meanwhile, moving averages highlight key levels as ETH struggles to gain momentum above crucial resistance zones. Volume remains relatively low, signaling a lack of strong buying or selling pressure. With these indicators in focus, Ethereum’s next major move will likely depend on whether bulls can break resistance or if bears succeed in driving prices lower. Traders should keep a close watch on crucial levels to anticipate the direction of the next big price swing. Potential Scenarios For Ethereum: Bullish Surge vs. Bearish Breakdown As Ethereum continues its extended consolidation, the market braces for two possible outcomes: a bullish surge or a bearish breakdown. Both scenarios carry significant implications for traders and investors, making this a critical juncture for ETH’s price action. Related Reading: Altseason At Risk? Expert Believes Ethereum Must Hold $2,600 To Sustain Momentum If buyers regain control and push ETH above the key $2,862 resistance level, a strong breakout is likely to occur. A surge in buying pressure alongside increasing volume, may trigger a rally toward the next major resistance zone at $3,051. More investors are expected to be drawn following a successful move past this level, reinforcing upward momentum. On the other hand, if selling pressure intensifies and Ethereum loses critical $2,518 support, a bearish breakdown could occur. This would open the door for a deeper retracement, testing lower demand zones. A decline in volume on recovery attempts would indicate weak bullish interest, increasing the likelihood of further downside. In this case, Ethereum eyes lower support zones such as $2,160 before finding stability.

The OSFI announced the final guidelines in the regulator’s quarterly report on Thursday, on cryptocurrency assets, together with consultation on capital requirements amid a major shift in the regulatory approach in the US where requirements are expected to ease. The initiative marks a significant step in digital assets and financial stability. According to the Globe and Mail , the OSFI has been reviewing how Canada’s banks manage risks associated with crypto-assets. These include platforms and currencies such as Bitcoin – in their client portfolios. According to the regulation, banks should consider crypto that sits directly on their balance sheets, as well as asset exposures among their customers, at a time adoption of digital assets is improving. The Globe and Mail has reported that Canadians who own Bitcoin jumped to 13% in 2021 from 5% in 2018, largely among men, as per figures released by the Bank of Canada in December. While the OSFI is of the view that the current risk is relatively low, activity is picking up quickly, which calls for more oversight, according to Assistant Superintendent and Chief Strategy and Risk Officer Angie Radiskovic. “We’re in a market where crypto is starting to pick up dramatically,” Ms. Radiskovic said during a conference call with reporters.

40600997,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=679141,1740081626,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40600997.jpeg,SEC unveils cyber and emerging technologies unit to tackle crypto and AI fraud,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sec-unveils-a-unit-to-tackle-crypto-fraud/,"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced the creation of the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit (CETU), a specialized task force aimed at cracking down on cyber-related misconduct and safeguarding retail investors from evolving digital threats. According to Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda, the unit will safeguard investors and support capital formation and market efficiency by paving the way for innovation to thrive. He also noted that it would eliminate those attempting to misuse innovation to harm investors and erode confidence in new technologies. Laura D’Allaird takes charge of the new SEC unit The new division will be headed by Laura D’Allaird and replace the former Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. D’Allaird has been at the SEC for several years in various enforcement roles. The CETU comprises approximately 30 fraud specialists and attorneys across SEC offices. The Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit’s mission includes identifying and eliminating cyber threats that exploit emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain. According to Uyeda, the unit will play a critical role in enforcing regulations while fostering market confidence. CETU’s focus encompasses hacking attempts against nonpublic financial information, unauthorized takeovers of retail brokerage accounts, fraud in blockchain technology and crypto assets, cybersecurity compliance deficiencies among regulated entities, and misleading disclosures concerning cybersecurity risks by public companies. Uyeda noted that the new unit would also parallel Commissioner Hester Peirce ‘s work within the newly formed Crypto Task Force. As recently as last month, Peirce laid out her priorities for that task force, including classifying certain tokens as “non-securities.” Following the new Trump administration’s taking office, the SEC has embarked upon a regulatory change distinct from that of former Chair Gary Gensler. The agency had previously expressed skepticism about crypto and argued that many cryptocurrencies are actually securities. In forming Peirce’s task force, the agency said its goal was to put the SEC on a “sensible regulatory path that respects the limits of the law.” LIBRA collapse ignites debate over insider trading and regulatory failures While insider trading allegations regarding crypto have been discussed for years, the debate has intensified since Feb. 14, when the LIBRA meme coin crashed. The meme coin, championed by Javier Milei, the president of Argentina, became synonymous with a space stacked against retail investors who suffer from not having the advantages of inside information. The rug pull, which made more than $100 million for the team behind the token, resulted in losses of more than $251 million to investors after the token was artificially inflated and then dumped. The rug pull took place on Jupiter, a decentralized exchange on Solana, which claimed that the launch of a Milei-backed meme coin was widely known among meme coin circles. In the meantime, Jupiter has started an investigation, and one Meteora co-founder has stepped back amid the fallout. SEC strengthens cybersecurity oversight in the digital age Emerging financial technologies have created a complex regulatory ecosystem. With increasing digital fraud, federal and state government agencies are ramping up efforts to strengthen identity verification and fraud prevention systems. Modern solutions integrating third-party consumer data and device intelligence are becoming essential to combat synthetic identities and safeguard public services. The SEC’s new unit wants to stay ahead of the trend, drawing on the team’s deep knowledge of fintech and cybersecurity.

There are so many different coins, trading methods, and prices that change frequently. This can be overwhelming, especially for those who are new to it. Crypto trading platforms were created to soften these barriers, making it easier for users to invest, trade, and, simply put – navigate the market. These platforms provide easy-to-understand strategies and, in some cases, offer automated trading using bots that follow potentially successful strategies. However, since there are so many trading platforms available, it can be challenging to decide which one to choose. This article will look at some of 2025’s best crypto trading platforms for people with different levels of experience and investment goals. We will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each platform and highlight their unique features, and explain which one is currently the best choice for both beginners and those who've been trading for a while. Choosing the Right Crypto Trading Platform Whether you're a long-term investor looking for structured diversification or a high-stakes trader chasing volatility, understanding the key differences between platforms is crucial. This review examines some of the top crypto trading platforms, highlighting how they cater to different types of users. The key factors that impact their attractiveness include: Entry barriers – How accessible the platform is for different types of users, from complete beginners to seasoned traders. Centralization vs. decentralization – Whether the platform is governed by a central entity or operates through decentralized governance, giving users a say in key decisions. Passive income opportunities – Whether users can earn through staking, fee-sharing, or holding assets, or if profitability is solely dependent on active trading. Risk exposure & mitigation – Whether the platform offers tools to minimize risk, such as diversified investments, or encourages high-risk strategies like leverage trading. Customization & trading flexibility – The ability to create personalized investment strategies, such as custom indexes or algorithmic trading setups. Innovation & Web3 integration – Whether the platform is building next-gen DeFi solutions like decentralized index trading or simply offering traditional finance tools repackaged for crypto. Platform Entry Barriers Centralization Passive Income Risk Exposure Customization Innovation CryptoIndex Low Decentralized Yes Low High High Iconomi Medium Centralized Yes Medium Medium Medium Mudrex Low Centralized No Medium Low Medium BitMEX High Centralized No High High Low Delta Exchange High Centralized No High High Low 1. CryptoIndex: The All-in-One Web3 Index Trading Platform Indexes are the most popular financial instruments globally, generating over $224 trillion annually in traditional finance (TradFi). CryptoIndex is the first Web3 protocol to introduce index trading to crypto, unlocking a projected $500 billion market in the industry. This platform brands itself as the ""Nasdaq of crypto"" and does it for a reason. For those who don't know, crypto indexes are collections of different cryptocurrencies hand-picked and put together by experts, based on their market potential, growth prospects, and alignment with current trends. These indexes can then be invested into and traded like traditional financial instruments, allowing investors to gain exposure to a well-constructed portfolio without having to buy each cryptocurrency individually. By investing in a crypto index, individuals can reduce their risk through diversification, as the performance isn't solely reliant on a single asset. This makes them an appealing option for both new and experienced investors looking to get into the volatile market with more confidence. CryptoIndex enables both index creation and index purchasing. While investing in pre-made indexes offers a more efficient way to generate profits, experienced traders can monetize their market insights by providing paid access to their custom indexes. Each index creator sets entry and exit fees, with a portion going to the creator and the rest distributed to index token holders. As a holder, you earn a share of these fees every time someone joins or leaves the index, meaning the longer you hold, the more passive income you generate. All the fees on the CryptoIndex platform are paid in $INDX tokens, and with each transaction, demand increases, strengthening the tokenomics. Benefits of holding the $INDX tokens include up to 35% fee discounts, special perks, and rewards for those who stake them, all of which can help increase profits when trading on the platform. Unlike TradFi, where users only have access to periodic reports with limited information, the CryptoIndex platform allows tracking all transactions 24/7. Moreover, few platforms offer real opportunities for crypto index trading, and those that do come with major limitations – restricted index availability, small token selections, and access to only a few dozen assets. CryptoIndex changes that with over 30,000 coins on DEX, extensive customization, and more than 1,000 expert-created indexes. This democratizes crypto investing, letting creators monetize their communities while users find indexes that match their risk and strategy. Pros and Cons of CryptoIndex As great as it may seem, it’s important to look at the advantages and disadvantages of CryptoIndex. Pros: Wide range of indexes: CryptoIndex offers over 1,000 indexes that cover many areas of the cryptocurrency market. Whether you’re interested in meme coins, DeFi projects, protocols, Layer 2 blockchains – you’re likely to find something that suits your interests. Some of the most popular indexes offered by the platform include GLOB, DELE, and L2S, allowing users to invest smartly in global blockchain, decentralized ledger, and Layer 2 coins. Easy to use: The platform is designed to be user-friendly. It’s simple to connect your crypto wallet and start trading indexes in just one click. ""Hold to Earn"" feature: This feature allows you to earn money just by holding $INDX tokens. You receive a share of the trading fees generated within the index, which gives you an additional reason to keep your tokens beyond hoping their price will go up. Community control: Each index is managed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization ( DAO ). This means that token holders can vote on important matters, such as rebalancing the index or changing fees. This structure promotes transparency and gives the community a voice in how things are run. Create your own index: CryptoIndex allows users to create their own custom indexes by choosing from over 30,000 tokens across different blockchains. This feature lets you implement your own investment ideas and strategies and earn a share of the fees every time someone trades or invests in your index. Qualified team and high-profile partnerships: CryptoIndex benefits from a world-class team of experts from Binance, Visa, and Deutsche Börse, along with strategic partnerships with Nasdaq and BNB Chain, bringing the expertise and connections needed to drive success. Cons: New platform: CryptoIndex is relatively new, having launched in December 2024. While this brings exciting opportunities, it also means that the platform is still developing, and some features may change or improve over time. Intricacies of index trading: Even though the platform is easy to use, the concept of index trading can be slightly complicated for complete beginners. It’s essential to understand how markets work and how to manage risks properly. CryptoIndex stands out because it offers a complete approach to crypto index trading. The easy-to-use platform, a wide selection of indexes, and the opportunity to earn passive income just by holding index tokens make it attractive to all levels of traders. The community-led governance adds to its appeal, making it transparent and community-focused. 2. Iconomi: A Social Trading Platform Iconomi is a social trading platform that allows users to follow and copy the trading strategies of experienced traders. This means you can learn from others who have more knowledge and experience in cryptocurrency trading. On Iconomi, you can browse profiles of various experienced traders, check their past performance, and see the strategies they use. If you find a trader whose approach you like, you can choose to automatically copy their trades. When you do this, any trades they make will automatically be mirrored in your own account. So, if they make a successful trade, you can benefit from their expertise without having to do all the research yourself, but if they lose money, you lose too. In addition to the potential to earn money, Iconomi offers a valuable learning experience. Watching how skilled traders operate, can help you gain insights into different trading techniques and how to analyze the market. Pros and Cons of Iconomi Copying trades from experts might seem like a good idea but it comes with its own advantages and disadvantages. Let’s look at the pros and cons of using Iconomi: Pros: Learn from experts: Apart from just copy-trading, Iconomi lets you learn from experienced traders. You can see their strategies and understand how they approach trading, which can help you improve your own skills. Diversify your investments: The platform allows you to follow multiple traders with different styles. This means you can spread out your investments across various strategies, which can help reduce risk. Potential for passive income: By copying successful traders, you have the chance to earn money without needing to manage your portfolio actively. This makes it appealing to those who prefer a more hands-off approach to investing. Cons: Dependence on others: Your success on Iconomi relies on the traders you choose to follow. If they don't perform well, your results might suffer, which can be unpredictable. Limited control: Since you are essentially copying other traders, you have little control over the specific trades they make. This can be frustrating if you want to make your own decisions. Risk of scams: Social trading platforms like Iconomi can have risks, such as copy-trading scams or unreliable trading patterns. This means there’s a chance you could lose money if you follow the wrong traders. In summary, Iconomi offers opportunities to learn and potentially earn through social trading . However, your success depends heavily on the actions of others, which may not be ideal for people who are already experts or already have their own strategies. 3. Mudrex: Simplifying Crypto Investing with Bots Mudrex is a platform that aims to make cryptocurrency trading and investing easier by using automated bots. These bots are designed to help users manage their investments without needing to constantly monitor the market. On Mudrex, you'll find a marketplace where you can choose from a variety of pre-made trading bots. Each bot is built with a specific strategy and comes with different levels of risk, allowing you to select one that fits your investment style and comfort level. This means you can find a bot that matches your goals, whether you're looking for something more aggressive or a more conservative approach. By using these automated bots, you can save time and reduce the stress of trading. Instead of having to analyze the market and make trades manually, the bots do the work for you, following their programmed strategies. Pros and Cons of Mundrex While the idea of automating trades with bots seems interesting, let’s look at the pros and cons of using Mudrex for automated trading. Pros: Beginner-friendly: Mudrex is designed to be easy for new traders and investors. It provides a straightforward way to automate trading strategies, making it accessible for those who may not have much experience in trading. Diverse bot selection: The platform offers a wide variety of trading bots. This allows users to choose strategies that match their individual risk tolerance and investment goals, giving them flexibility in their trading approach. Backtesting capabilities: Mudrex enables users to test their bots using historical data. This feature allows traders to see how a bot would have performed in the past, helping them make more informed decisions before committing to using real funds. Cons: Reliance on bots: Since Mudrex primarily offers pre-built bots, users have limited control over customizing their own trading strategies. This can be restrictive for those who want to tailor their approach to specific market conditions. Potential for losses: While automated trading can save time, it’s important to remember that bots are not foolproof. They can still incur losses, especially in volatile market conditions, which can lead to financial setbacks for users. Fees: Mudrex charges fees for using its platform and accessing certain trading bots. These fees can reduce overall profits, making it important for users to consider the costs involved. Overall, Mudrex simplifies automated trading, making it a good option for those looking for an easy way to trade without extensive knowledge. However, it lacks some of the advanced features and community governance found in platforms like CryptoIndex. Additionally, the reliance on pre-made bots limits users' control and flexibility, so it may not suit everyone’s trading style. 4. BitMEX: High-Leverage Trading (For Experienced Traders Only) BitMEX is a trading platform for cryptocurrency derivatives. A key feature of BitMEX is that it offers high leverage which means you can borrow a large amount of money to increase the size of your trades. For example, if you have $1,000 and you use 100x leverage, you could trade as if you had $100,000. While this can lead to massive profits if the market goes your way, it also comes with a high risk of big losses. If the market moves against you, you could lose your entire investment very quickly. Because of these risks, BitMEX is mainly intended for experienced traders who are comfortable taking on high-risk strategies. It's not a good choice for beginners or those who prefer to avoid risky investments, as the potential for losing money is quite high. Pros and Cons of BitMEX While BitMEX presents many opportunities for experienced traders, it also carries risks and can be quite complex. Here are the main pros and cons of using BitMEX. Pros: High leverage: BitMEX allows you to borrow a large amount of money to trade, which can greatly increase your potential profits. However, this also means that your losses can be just as large if the market moves against you. Advanced tools: The platform provides sophisticated trading tools that are helpful for experienced traders. These tools can assist in executing complex trading strategies and managing risk. High trading activity: BitMEX has a lot of trading activity, meaning there are many buyers and sellers. This high liquidity makes it easier for you to buy and sell assets without causing major changes in their prices. Cons: Very risky: Trading with high leverage is risky and new traders might find it hard to manage these risks effectively. Compared to some other platforms, BitMEX exposes users to extreme volatility, where a single market movement can wipe out an entire position. While experienced traders may thrive in this high-risk environment, those seeking a more structured, strategic, and sustainable investment approach may find CryptoIndex a safer and more accessible alternative. Complex features: BitMEX requires advanced trading knowledge, risk management skills, and an understanding of leverage, making it inaccessible to most casual investors. High level of centralization: BitMEX operates as a centralized exchange, meaning all decisions, from trading policies to risk management, are controlled by the company. In summary, BitMEX is best suited for experienced traders who understand the risks involved in high-leverage trading. It may not be the right choice for the average cryptocurrency investor due to its high-risk nature and complex features. 5. Delta Exchange: Crypto Derivatives Trading Delta Exchange is a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange that offers a variety of trading options, such as crypto options, futures, and other advanced financial products. This platform is designed for experienced traders who are looking for more advanced trading tools and strategies. On Delta Exchange, you can engage in different types of derivatives trading, which allows you to speculate on the future price movements of cryptocurrencies. For example, you can trade options that give you the right to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at a specific price within a certain timeframe. Futures contracts allow you to agree to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at a set price on a future date. Because of its focus on advanced trading products, Delta Exchange is similar to BitMEX, another popular exchange in the crypto space. However, it may not be the best choice for beginners, as the complexity of these products requires a good understanding of trading concepts and risk management. Pros and Cons of Delta Exchange While Delta Exchange has several advantages, like a wide selection of derivatives and a user-friendly design, it also has some challenges, especially for newcomers. Here are the main strengths and weaknesses of using Delta Exchange. Pros: Variety of derivatives: Delta Exchange provides a wider range of derivative products than many other exchanges. This gives traders more choices when it comes to selecting the best products for their strategies. Advanced tools: The platform offers sophisticated trading tools that are helpful for experienced users. These tools allow traders to use more advanced strategies and better manage their trades. Good interface: Delta Exchange features an easy-to-use interface, making it simpler for traders to navigate the platform compared to some of its competitors. Cons: Very risky: Trading derivatives is inherently risky and can lead to huge losses, particularly for those who are not familiar with how these products work. Complex: The various products and features available on Delta Exchange can be confusing for beginners, which may make it hard for them to use the platform effectively. Lower liquidity: Delta Exchange may have lower liquidity compared to larger exchanges like BitMEX. This means that it can be more difficult to buy and sell assets quickly without impacting their prices. Like BitMEX, Delta Exchange is not right for most crypto investors because it's too risky and complex. Only those with experience are advised to use this platform. Conclusion: Opt for the Platform That Covers Your Needs When it comes to selecting the best crypto trading platform in 2025, it really depends on your personal experience, how much risk you are willing to take, and your investment goals. Different platforms like Mudrex, Iconomi, BitMEX, and Delta Exchange each offer their own unique features and advantages. However, CryptoIndex stands out as a strong option for many users. It provides a wide range of indexes, has an easy-to-use interface, and includes an innovative ""Hold to Earn"" feature. Additionally, its community-led governance makes it a popular choice among traders. Always remember to do your own research and think carefully about the risks involved before investing in any cryptocurrency or choosing a trading platform.
