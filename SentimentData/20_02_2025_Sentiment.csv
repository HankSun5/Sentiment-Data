The Securities and Exchange Commission acknowledged WisdomTree’s bid to list and trade exchange-traded fund shares for an ( XRP ) trust. This acknowledgment initiates a 21-day public comment period, allowing the public to provide feedback on how the agency should approach WisdomTree’s application. Comment periods officially open after the SEC adds a filing to the Federal Register. Over the last few days, several prospective XRP ETF filings joined the Federal Register.

Bitcoin Demand Weakens, Increasing Price Correction Risks Bitcoin demand growth has weakened substantially. After a surge in November-December 2024, partly fueled by U.S. election results, demand has sharply declined from 279,000 on December 4, 2024 to just 70,000 today. This decline in demand is further reflected in ETF activity. Bitcoin ETF net inflows, which peaked at 18,000 BTC, have reversed to a net outflow of 1,000 BTC, signaling a pullback in investor confidence. Demand for Bitcoin from Spot ETFs is less than half of what it was at this point last year. Net inflows 2025: 41K Bitcoin 2024: 100K Bitcoin ETFs are simply not buying as much so far this year. pic.twitter.com/IjDGSRrvn9 — Julio Moreno (@jjcmoreno) February 19, 2025 CryptoQuant’s Inter-exchange Flow Pulse highlights declining spot Bitcoin demand in the U.S., as fewer BTC are moving from other exchanges to Coinbase. The metric recently fell below its 90-day moving average , suggesting reduced buying interest among both institutional and retail investors. This trend raises the likelihood of an extended price correction. CryptoQuant Data Shows Weak Liquidity Inflows from Stablecoins Despite stablecoins reaching a record $200 billion in total market capitalization, their expansion rate has decelerated sharply. The 60-day change in USDT’s market cap has dropped 92%, declining from $20.4 billion on December 16 to just $1.5 billion today. A recovery in stablecoin liquidity could play a key role in supporting Bitcoin’s price stability. Without a sustained influx of liquidity, Bitcoin may struggle to regain upward momentum. In addition to weak demand and slowing liquidity, Bitcoin network activity has fallen to its lowest level in a year, declining 17% since peaking in November 2024. CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin Network Activity Index has slipped below its 365-day moving average for the first time since July 2021, when China banned Bitcoin mining. This trend suggests reduced on-chain demand, reinforcing bearish conditions. With demand weakening, liquidity inflows slowing, and network activity declining, Bitcoin remains vulnerable to further price corrections unless a shift in market conditions reverses these trends. Investing in Uncertain Times As Bitcoin faces pressure on multiple fronts, the discussion invites readers to embrace reflective decision-making. The combination of subdued demand, tepid liquidity, and quiet network activity offers an opportunity to rethink one’s approach to digital investments . It raises a critical question: how should one manage exposure in a market characterized by continuous flux? Rather than chasing temporary optimism, this period calls for a disciplined appraisal of risk and potential. Each piece of market data contributes to a broader narrative, urging investors to craft strategies that are both measured and informed.

CryptoQuant data shows that $450M in USDT flowed into centralized exchanges, the highest level since February 3. Liquidity is flowing back to exchanges, with $450M deposited in the past 24 hours. The inflows are the highest since February 3. The net inflows show more stablecoins were moved to markets than were taken out. The recent spike in net inflows suggests a bigger market move may follow. The positive net flows follow a recent liquidity injection , where briefly as much as $2.7B in stablecoins entered the markets. This time, USDT was the more active stablecoin. Inflows of USDT and USDC may signal both bullish attitudes or the need to cover leveraged positions. Exchange inflows and outflows shift their direction more rapidly in the past few months, immediately responding to shifts in sentiment. The increased inflows followed a turbulent day for the crypto markets, where Bitcoin (BTC) hovered between the $95,000 and $97,000 range, while Solana (SOL) returned to levels from the end of 2024. The recent stablecoin inflows follow ongoing ‘buying the dip’ as more BTC is making its way into accumulation addresses . Stablecoins increase overall supply, remain top gas burners The exchange flows are reflecting the increased supply of top stablecoins. UDSC added 8.7B tokens in the past month, while USDT expanded its supply by 5.1B tokens. Stablecoins are already showing liquidity is waiting on the sidelines, with $226.8B available through leading dollar-denominated assets. The supply of all stablecoins increased by 7.79% in the past month, but the tokens stayed less active. Up to 30.3M addresses spent stablecoins, though the activity is down by 26.7% in the past month. The increased inflows suggest stablecoin holders may be reawakening. Tether’s smart contract remains the biggest gas burner for Ethereum. The recent supply injection follows increased gas usage in the past couple of days. USDT remains highly active on Ethereum, making use of the currently favorable transaction fees. Tether still burns over 5.1% of all gas on Ethereum. Circle’s USDC token has a less busy contract, with 2.53% of gas burns in a 24-hour period. Both USDT and USDC had some of their most active days on January 20 and February 3, showing stablecoins reacted immediately to market shifts and opportunities. Exchanges hold $42B in dry powder While exchange reserves for BTC and Ethereum (ETH) are near all-time lows, stablecoins have accumulated on most markets. The overall liquidity on exchanges increased in the past weeks, rising to $42.4B . The liquidity is not yet deployed, as trader behavior signaled ‘fear’ , based on the Bitcoin fear and greed index. Exchanges hold peak USDT reserves, though the biggest inflows went to derivative exchanges, most prominently Binance. | Source: Cryptoquant One of the curious changes for stablecoin usage is that spot exchanges have seen almost constant outflows. The big shift in dry powder is on derivative exchanges. Binance’s inflows were the steepest, as over $28B of the available liquidity is locked on the exchange. Bybit also saw a steep rise in stablecoin inflows, so far accumulating $3.1B. Smaller markets like Crypto.com have accrued $410M in available liquidity. Not all exchanges see the same available stablecoins for trading, and Binance may still lead during the next part of the cycle. Open interest is shifting downward for riskier stablecoins, while still remaining relatively low for blue chips like BTC and ETH. However, the available dry powder reveals a preparation for a shift in sentiment and for rebuilding leveraged positions. For now, not all of the liquidity is deployed, as traders are more cautious. However, the accumulation of stablecoins may not mean direct buying, but even more speculative trading in derivatives. The collection of simple spot exchanges holds a fraction of the available USDT liquidity.

Bitcoin, the flagship digital currency, is trading at $95,695, reflecting a slight uptick of 0.26% from its previous close. In tandem with these market movements, Hong Kong is actively bolstering its status as a regional digital assets hub. The Securities and Futures Commission has granted nine digital asset trading platform licenses, with eight more applications under review. This regulatory momentum is complemented by media expansion efforts, such as Elon Musk’s platform, X, launching its inaugural business news show, “From the Desk of Anthony Pompliano,” hosted by the renowned Bitcoin commentator. Amidst these developments, Qubetics ($TICS) emerges as a groundbreaking player, addressing real-world challenges that its predecessors have yet to tackle. By introducing a Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, Qubetics is poised to revolutionize how businesses, professionals, and individuals engage with blockchain and digital finance, offering solutions that are both innovative, practical and one of the top cryptos to hold for short term. Qubetics: Pioneering Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics isn’t just another name in the crypto space—it’s a game-changer. At its core lies the Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace , designed to bring traditional assets into the digital age, making ownership and investment more accessible than ever before. For businesses, this marketplace offers a novel way to raise capital. By tokenizing assets, companies can attract a global pool of investors, bypassing traditional financial intermediaries. This method streamlines fundraising, reduces costs, and accelerates project timelines. Individuals, regardless of their financial standing, gain the opportunity to diversify their investment portfolios. By owning tokens representing a share in various assets, they can hedge against market volatility and explore sectors previously inaccessible to them. As of now, Qubetics is in its 22nd presale stage, with the $TICS token priced at $0.08073. The presale has garnered significant attention, raising over $13.3 million from more than 20,500 token holders, with over 480 million $TICS tokens sold. Early investors are eyeing substantial returns, with potential ROI projections of up to 20,338% as the platform matures and gains traction in the market and becomes the Top Cryptos to Hold for Short Term. Bitcoin: The Digital Gold Standard Bitcoin (BTC) continues to dominate the cryptocurrency space. Currently trading at $95,695, it has seen a minor increase of 0.26% from the previous close. Despite a 14% decline since its all-time high in January, Bitcoin remains the ultimate digital asset for both new and seasoned investors. Bitcoin’s unwavering dominance in the cryptocurrency market is driven by several key factors. Market confidence remains a significant force, with Bitcoin’s market capitalization far exceeding that of any other cryptocurrency, solidifying its position as digital gold. Institutional adoption continues to grow, as major financial institutions integrate Bitcoin into their portfolios, reinforcing its stability and long-term potential. Additionally, regulatory developments in key financial hubs like Hong Kong are fostering broader cryptocurrency integration, potentially accelerating institutional adoption on a larger scale. These factors collectively ensure Bitcoin’s continued leadership in the digital asset space. Analysts remain bullish about Bitcoin’s future. Anthony Scaramucci, head of a leading crypto ETF, projects Bitcoin could reach $200,000 in 2025, citing U.S. reserves for Bitcoin as a driving force. His ETF reported a 74% return in 2024, driven by investments in key industry players like MicroStrategy and Coinbase. This performance follows its all-time high of $109,071 in January 2025, marking a 14% decline since that peak. Meanwhile, Monero, a prominent privacy-focused cryptocurrency, is priced at $236.09, showing a modest increase of 0.46% from its last close. Moreover, Bitcoin continues to gain mainstream attention. Elon Musk’s platform, X, recently launched a business news show featuring Anthony Pompliano, solidifying Bitcoin’s role in financial discourse reinforcing its position as one of the top cryptos to hold for short term. Monero: The Privacy Powerhouse Monero (XMR) is the go-to cryptocurrency for those who prioritize privacy. Currently priced at $236.09, it has recorded a modest 0.46% increase from its previous close. Monero’s unique attributes make it an invaluable asset in a world where financial privacy is under constant scrutiny. Key reasons why Monero remains a strong contender Unlike Bitcoin, Monero transactions are completely anonymous, making it impossible to trace sender and receiver details. Every XMR coin is identical to another, preventing blacklisting and censorship of specific coins. The Monero Research Lab continuously enhances the blockchain’s privacy features, ensuring it stays ahead of surveillance tactics and one of the top cryptos to hold for short term. Despite its advantages, Monero has faced regulatory challenges. In late 2024, Kraken delisted Monero in Europe due to increasing scrutiny on privacy coins. However, the project’s community remains steadfast, working on solutions to ensure Monero remains accessible worldwide. Conclusion: The Best Cryptos to Hold for Short-Term Gains Whether it’s Bitcoin’s unwavering dominance, Monero’s privacy-centric approach, or Qubetics’ groundbreaking asset tokenization, each of these cryptocurrencies offers unique advantages. While Bitcoin provides a solid store of value and Monero ensures financial privacy, Qubetics is reshaping the landscape with its real-world asset tokenization. The opportunity to invest early in Qubetics’ presale is rapidly closing. With over $13.3 million raised and massive projected ROIs, $TICS stands as the most promising crypto for short-term gains. Those who recognize the potential now are setting themselves up for massive financial growth in the evolving digital economy. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics different from Bitcoin and Monero? Qubetics introduces real-world asset tokenization, allowing users to invest in tangible assets like real estate, fine art, and luxury goods, unlike Bitcoin and Monero, which primarily function as digital currencies. Why is Bitcoin considered the best store of value in crypto? Bitcoin’s limited supply, institutional adoption, and market dominance make it the most trusted cryptocurrency for storing value over time. How does Monero ensure privacy in digital transactions? Monero uses advanced cryptographic techniques like ring signatures and stealth addresses to conceal transaction details, ensuring complete financial privacy. What is real-world asset tokenization, and how does Qubetics implement it? Real-world asset tokenization involves converting tangible assets into digital tokens for fractional ownership. Qubetics enables this process through its blockchain-powered marketplace. Is Qubetics’ presale a good opportunity for short-term investors? Yes, with over $13.3 million raised and significant projected ROI, Qubetics offers a lucrative short-term investment opportunity before its presale ends.

Here’s what experts say,https://crypto.news/crypto-casino-meme-coins-hype/,"The crypto market is thriving, but meme coins dominate trading volumes. Are they fueling mass adoption or steering the industry toward a short-term, casino-like mentality? Experts weigh in. Table of Contents Hype, politics, and billions Are meme coins a liquidity drain or gateway to crypto? The role of platforms like Pump.fun Who’s responsible for the meme coins hype? Why do traders keep coming back? The LIBRE scandal and what comes next Hype, politics, and billions Meme coins are no longer a fringe element of the crypto market — they’ve become its driving force, fueling an era of speculation, volatility, and cultural transformation. Platforms like Pump.fun , a Solana ( SOL ) based launchpad, have made it easier than ever for anyone to create and trade meme tokens instantly, establishing themselves as the epicenter of viral token launches. Since its debut in January 2024, Pump.fun has facilitated the creation of over six million meme coins, the vast majority serving no purpose beyond speculation. The craze has even spilled into political circles, intertwining finance, hype, and governance. In Argentina, President Javier Milei faced backlash over his alleged endorsement of the LIBRA meme coin, a token that soared and then collapsed within hours, leaving retail investors nursing heavy losses. The fallout sparked a political firestorm, with opposition leaders demanding his impeachment. Meanwhile, in the U.S., just days before his inauguration, Donald Trump’s own meme coin — named Official Trump ( TRUMP ) — experienced a meteoric rise , reaching a $15 billion market cap before retreating to $3.35 billion as of Feb. 19. Adding to the spectacle, Melania Trump also launched her own token, Melania Meme ( MELANIA ), which also attracted billions in trading volume. With retail traders pouring billions into assets often devoid of fundamental utility, crypto.news reached out to industry experts to assess whether meme coins are draining liquidity and stifling innovation, or are they onboarding a new wave of investors into digital assets? Let’s dive into the debate. Are meme coins a liquidity drain or gateway to crypto? A key argument in favor of meme coins is their ability to attract fresh capital and onboard users who might not have engaged with crypto otherwise. Unlike technical blockchain projects, meme coins don’t require an understanding of staking mechanisms, interoperability, or smart contract security. Instead, their appeal lies in simplicity — catchy branding, viral marketing, and a low barrier to entry. Daria Morgen, Head of Research at Changelly, rejects the idea that meme coins are starving serious projects of liquidity. She argues that the traders flocking to these tokens wouldn’t necessarily be investing in blockchain protocols in the first place. “Many start with meme coins but eventually explore more serious projects. I don’t think meme coins necessarily divert liquidity. While some people might leave crypto altogether, most meme coin traders wouldn’t have invested in blockchain projects anyway — or they already hold assets like BTC or SOL. It’s a free market, and it’s up to utility-driven projects to attract liquidity and build their audience.” However, others argue that meme coins aren’t just absorbing retail cash but also altering broader market dynamics, making it harder for legitimate projects to gain traction. Tobin Kuo, CEO of Seraph Studios, has experienced this shift firsthand. His company develops AAA blockchain-based role-playing games, where players can own in-game assets as NFTs and earn rewards through gameplay. But with traders chasing quick profits in meme coins, long-term projects like his are struggling to maintain engagement. “For those of us building in GameFi, this is a challenging time. Players are spending less time engaging with in-game economies, and the kind of success seen during the Axie Infinity era isn’t easily replicable in today’s ‘fast in, fast out’ trading environment. My team and I are constantly adapting, looking for ways to reintroduce deeper engagement and sustainable incentives for players.” His point reflects a growing trend in crypto. In previous cycles, speculation often centred on emerging sectors like DeFi or play-to-earn gaming. Now, much of that speculative liquidity is flowing into meme coins, leaving projects that rely on sustained participation struggling to build engaged communities. Jessica Zheng, CEO of Cycle Network, sees both sides of the debate. While she acknowledges that meme coins bring retail engagement, she also notes a growing short-term mindset that has made the industry feel increasingly hype-driven rather than focused on real development. “The meme coin boom initially started as a pushback against big capital controlling the market — a way for grassroots communities to express their frustration and take a stand. Early on, successful meme coins actually had positive external effects, drawing in Web2 users and sparking interest in Web3. But as the market has matured, meme coins have also revealed major issues. The short-term gains have attracted a lot of people who see crypto as a quick cash grab, making the industry feel more short-sighted and less focused on sustainable growth.” This shift toward short-termism is precisely what concerns Georgii Verbitskii, Founder of TYMIO. He argues that meme coins have delayed the broader market’s transition into a true altcoin bull run. “The meme coin mania has drained market liquidity. We’re seeing thousands of new meme coins launch daily, siphoning capital away from more mature tokens, DeFi protocols, and altcoins with real utility. Many investors now prefer meme coins over sound investments, which is why fundamentally strong altcoins and protocols are getting less attention.” The role of platforms like Pump.fun Meme coins wouldn’t have reached their current scale without the rise of frictionless token launchpads. Platforms like Pump.fun have fundamentally changed the game, allowing anyone—regardless of technical expertise — to create and launch a token in seconds. At first glance, this kind of innovation aligns with the ethos of decentralization — open access, low barriers to entry, and a financial system free from traditional gatekeepers. But in practice, it has also fueled an unprecedented flood of speculative tokens. The question is whether these platforms are expanding financial opportunity or enabling unsustainable, Ponzi-like cycles that erode trust in crypto. Morgen sees both sides of the argument. While she acknowledges that platforms like Pump.fun lower entry barriers, she warns that their ease of use has also made it easier for bad actors to exploit retail traders. “While platforms like this foster creativity and make token launches more accessible, they also contribute to an oversaturation of low-quality assets. This environment enables pump-and-dump schemes, making them easier to execute. Such practices can erode trust in the crypto market and push away legitimate investors.” That erosion of trust is already playing out. Retail traders, lured by the promise of quick gains, often find themselves on the losing end of highly manipulated cycles. Some meme coins launched through platforms like Pump.fun see their entire liquidity drained within hours — early adopters walk away with profits, while most buyers are left holding tokens that collapse to near-zero value. Kuo takes an even harsher stance, arguing that these platforms have shifted the core narrative of crypto from innovation to gambling. “Honestly, trust in crypto isn’t exactly at an all-time high, and with the way things are going, even industry veterans joke about the space turning into the world’s largest casino. New entrants aren’t here for decentralization or blockchain innovation — they’re just chasing money, nothing else.” Zheng acknowledges the role of open-access launch platforms but warns that an influx of low-quality tokens isn’t sustainable. “It depends on how you look at it. Zero-barrier launchpads can act as catalysts, speeding up token creation and helping promising ideas gain exposure. In that sense, they create opportunities. But a catalyst only accelerates things — it doesn’t change fundamentals. If a project lacks real value from the start, launching it faster doesn’t make it sustainable. It’s still just empty hype.” Hence, the issue isn’t the existence of these platforms—it’s how they’re being used. The problem arises when these tokens are marketed purely as speculative bets, often promoted by influencers who pump them to their followers before cashing out. Who’s responsible for the meme coins hype? From social media figures hyping new tokens to exchanges listing them for a quick volume boost, multiple industry players profit from the speculation surrounding these assets. But when retail traders lose money — often on manipulated or rug-pulled tokens — who bears the responsibility? Morgen acknowledges the free-market nature of crypto but believes platforms and influencers must act responsibly. “The crypto market has always been about DYOR. It’s a free market — meme coins will come and go, and banning them isn’t realistic. Education is key to helping traders spot scams and rug pulls. However, platforms and influencers do share some responsibility. Promoting shady projects for quick gains may drive short-term profits, but it kills trust and drives users away over time.” Kuo, however, argues that the market isn’t truly free when those with the loudest voices manipulate it. “Everyone plays a role in this, and yes, this is how the market works. But calling it a ‘free market’ is a stretch when so much of the content is driven by paid promotions and, in many cases, outright manipulation.” His point highlights a growing concern — many meme coin traders don’t base decisions on independent research but on what’s trending on X, YouTube, or Telegram. The overwhelming influence of promoters, particularly influencers shilling projects for personal gain, makes it difficult for retail traders to assess real risks. Zheng takes a more neutral stance, acknowledging the influence of platforms and influencers while pointing to their responsibility. “Exchanges and influencers shape market sentiment, and while the market is technically free, many retail traders — especially newcomers — can be swayed by their narratives without fully understanding the risks. That can lead to losses. Influential figures and platforms have a responsibility to stay neutral and objective when sharing their views. They shouldn’t just chase engagement at the expense of retail investors.” Mori Xu, co-founder of Tabi Chain, sees the issue as one of balance. While many traders take reckless bets, he believes self-regulation within the industry could help curb the worst excesses. “Influencers and platforms should take some responsibility for the content they promote. They should provide clear risk disclosures and avoid misleading investors.” Verbitskii, meanwhile, sees the cycle of hype and loss as self-correcting. He argues that painful lessons will eventually shift market behavior. “The only thing that will slow it down is painful losses. When enough people get burned, fewer will jump in blindly. That’s the nature of market cycles.” Why do traders keep coming back? Meme coins have crashed countless times. Every cycle, a handful skyrocket, creating overnight millionaires, only to collapse just as quickly, leaving a trail of losses behind. Despite this predictable boom-and-bust pattern, traders keep diving back in, pouring billions into tokens that often have no real underlying value. At first glance, this behavior seems irrational. Why would investors willingly return to a market that has repeatedly burned them? Kuo compares meme coin speculation to the emotional trading patterns that have existed in traditional markets for centuries. “This is classic Bandwagon Effect psychology — something that has played out in stock markets for centuries. Investors buy assets simply because others are making money, often without fully understanding the fundamentals. This cycle has repeated itself in both stocks and crypto, and meme coins are no exception.” For example, stocks like GameStop (GME) and AMC experienced similar hype cycles during the retail trading frenzy of 2021. The difference is that in crypto, these cycles unfold much faster — sometimes within hours or days rather than months. Xu believes meme coins are driving a deeper shift in crypto, moving the market away from fundamentals-based investing and toward narrative-driven speculation. “Despite multiple crashes, traders keep chasing meme coins because of their high return potential, social media hype, and strong community influence. The excitement and FOMO around these tokens make them impossible to ignore.” Morgen offers a different perspective, arguing that crypto traders have always been split into two distinct camps — those seeking long-term stability and those embracing high-risk speculation. “It’s almost human nature to chase quick profits. There will always be risk-averse and risk-seeking investors: the former will hodl Bitcoin (or avoid crypto altogether), and the latter will gamble on meme coins. I don’t think there’s any real shift — crypto markets have always been like this.” The LIBRE scandal and what comes next The LIBRE scandal was a turning point in the debate over meme coin regulation. When the Argentine President was linked to the token, its price surged — only to collapse within hours, wiping out millions in investor funds. With meme coins now influencing global politics and financial markets, the question is no longer whether governments should intervene but how much regulation is too much. Kuo is sceptical that regulation will have any real impact. In his view, crypto is too decentralized for government restrictions to work effectively. “This is an interesting discussion, especially with the growing calls for KYC on meme coin launchpads. Some suggest that Pump.fun should require developers to verify their identities before launching tokens. But let’s be realistic. If you regulate Pump.fun, another platform will emerge to take its place. This cycle will repeat itself — just like how CEXs gave way to DEXs when regulations tightened.” Zheng takes a more measured stance. While she agrees that decentralization should be protected, she acknowledges that certain safeguards could help prevent market manipulation and retail losses. “The LIBRE scandal showed how easily meme coins — especially those with no real substance — can be manipulated by a small group of people, which isn’t good for the market. If nothing is done, a lot of retail investors could end up getting hurt.” Xu believes the solution lies in smart regulation — rules that protect investors without imposing excessive restrictions. “The LIBRE scandal highlighted how easily meme coins can be manipulated. I think governments should step in carefully. They have a role in protecting investors and maintaining market integrity, but overregulation could stifle the decentralized spirit of crypto.” The “smart regulation” approach aligns with what some countries are already exploring. Instead of outright banning meme coins, regulators could require disclosure rules, mandate influencers to reveal paid promotions, or enforce security audits for high-risk tokens. Meanwhile, Hedi Navazan, Chief Compliance Officer at 1inch Labs, argues that the lack of oversight makes meme coins particularly vulnerable to fraud, pump-and-dump cycles, and political misuse. “There are multiple risks in issuing meme coins, including market manipulation and the use of public figures to influence price movements in favor of their inner circle. Governance and structure are key. At the World Economic Forum in Davos 2025, meme coins became a major topic of discussion, with most experts expressing concerns over high-profile launches like Melania and Trump Coins. These moves could send the wrong message to the market, potentially leading to disappointment and raising doubts instead of showcasing blockchain’s real potential.” Verbitskii, meanwhile, believes the speculative frenzy is nearing its peak. While meme coins have absorbed much of the market’s liquidity, he argues their dominance may be short-lived. “I believe the peak of this meme coin mania is behind us. The release of the TRUMP token was likely the tipping point, so now it’s time for a cooling period. Many high-profile meme coins left buyers with heavy losses, which has created a negative perception of the market and could deter future investors.” However, history suggests this cooling-off period will be temporary. New narratives — whether political meme coins, celebrity-backed tokens, or AI-generated projects — will likely emerge, reviving speculation all over again. For now, crypto remains a wild west — where high risks, high rewards, and minimal oversight define the meme coin market. Whether governments step in or not, the next phase of crypto regulation will likely be shaped by how the industry responds to scandals like LIBRE and the political meme coin boom.",Feature|Exclusive|Crypto traders|gambling|Meme Coin|politics|rug pull,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-02-19 23:26:00

Despite billions in institutional inflows, the cryptocurrency has failed to break out significantly. A brief exception occurred on January 20, coinciding with U.S. President Donald Trump’s inauguration, when Bitcoin surged to an all-time high of $109,000 before swiftly retreating into its established range. Market Manipulation Suspicions Some industry leaders believe Bitcoin’s price stagnation may not be entirely organic. Samson Mow, CEO of Jan3 and founder of Pixelmatic, suspects deliberate price suppression. Speaking at Consensus Hong Kong 2025, Mow noted: “If you look at the price movement, we peak, and then we stay steady and chop sideways. It just looks very manufactured.” Mow further emphasized the unnatural nature of Bitcoin’s restricted price fluctuations, raising concerns about external forces shaping the market. ETF Inflows and Institutional Buying Fail to Move Price Despite steady accumulation by institutions and retail investors, Bitcoin’s price remains stagnant. Companies like Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy continue to buy Bitcoin in large quantities, yet the price refuses to budge. According to Mow, this suggests that substantial selling pressure is counteracting these inflows. “If Bitcoin’s price isn’t moving despite accumulation, then someone must be selling,” he explained. FTX Repayments and Potential Sell-Off Pressure Adding to market dynamics, FTX has begun repaying creditors, distributing over $1.2 billion based on Bitcoin’s November 2022 price of around $20,000. This could lead to increased selling pressure as recipients cash in on their gains. Mow pointed out that Bitcoin sales at mid-$20K levels are likely impacting market movements, preventing upward momentum. Despite these concerns, analysts remain optimistic, with 2025 price targets ranging between $160,000 and $180,000. However, for now, Bitcoin remains firmly within its controlled price range.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-19 23:31:00

The company, which until recently operated under the name MicroStrategy, targeted a 40%-50% conversion premium for the zero-coupon convertible notes maturing in 2030 at first, but the lowered stock volatility has forced a recalibration. Hedge funds and institutional investors, who often do complex trades involving bonds and short-selling Strategy shares, have been closely watching the deal. Bloomberg data shows that Strategy’s 30-day stock volatility has dropped to less than half of its December peak, reducing the opportunity for aggressive trading strategies tied to the company’s fluctuations. Strategy’s stock sheds value, but Bitcoin holdings surge Strategy’s stock has taken a 30% hit since November, pulling back from its record highs. Despite the dip, the stock remains up more than 700% over the past three years, driven by the company’s unstoppable Bitcoin acquisition strategy. As of press time, Strategy holds 478,740 Bitcoin, representing over 2.5% of the total Bitcoin supply, worth more than $45 billion at today’s prices. The company’s decision to focus on fixed-income securities and at-the-market stock sales is part of a plan to raise $42 billion by 2027 to continue accumulating Bitcoin. The convertible debt offering is Strategy’s first since raising over $560 million through a preferred stock sale at a big discount. Meanwhile, last Wednesday, Strategy reported its fourth consecutive quarterly loss, booking a $1.01 billion impairment charge tied to its Bitcoin holdings. This compares to just $39.2 million in impairment losses in the same period last year. The company’s net loss for the quarter hit $670.8 million, or $3.03 per share, a striking contrast to the $89.1 million profit recorded a year earlier. The massive write-down comes as Strategy prepares to adopt a new accounting rule in Q1, which will allow it to measure Bitcoin at fair market value instead of recognizing impairment losses when prices drop. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Kang said the fourth quarter will be the last when it recognizes an impairment charge on its bitcoin holdings. Despite its losses, Strategy purchased 218,887 Bitcoin in the last quarter alone, spending $20.5 billion in what is the largest Bitcoin acquisition in any quarter in its history. This brings Strategy’s total holdings to 471,107 Bitcoin as of February 2, with a market value of $46 billion. CEO Phong Le confirmed on the company’s post-earnings call that fixed-income issuance, including convertible bonds and preferred stock, will be a priority in 2025 as part of its plan to continue stacking Bitcoin.

Will LTC bulls hold out for a $250 breakout? Litecoin (LTC) Continues to Gain Momentum on ETF Hype Litecoin (LTC) has experienced considerable upside in February 2025, defying downward pressure from macroeconomic headwinds. Speculation surrounding altcoin ETF approvals has been a key factor in driving up LTC prices. Litecoin (LTC) Price Action This optimism was further reinforced after the SEC’s recent acknowledgment of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) ETF filings. As seen in the chart above, LTC price has reached a 40-day peak $136 on Feb. 19, rising by another 4% within the daily timeframe. The ETF narrative continues to fuel Litecoin’s rally, as investors anticipate increased liquidity and accessibility through regulated investment vehicles. Institutional Investors Enter $512M Buying Spree Ahead of ETF Launch Positive sentiment surrounding Litecoin ETF approvals has drawn significant institutional attention in recent days, propelling LTC to a new 40-day peak on Feb. 19. A closer look at on-chain data indicates that institutional investors have been aggressively accumulating LTC behind the scenes in anticipation of the ETF launch On-chain analytics from IntoTheBlock ’s Large Holder Netflow metric highlights a sustained accumulation trend among Litecoin’s largest whale addresses since the broader crypto market downturn began on Feb. 3, following Trump’s tariff announcement. This metric tracks net balance changes in wallets holding at least 0.1% of Litecoin’s total circulating supply, offering insight into whale activity during critical market phases. Litecoin Large Holder Netflow vs. LTC Price | Source: IntoTheBlock According to the data, Litecoin’s largest holders have maintained positive net inflows since Feb. 3. Over the past two weeks, these whale wallets have acquired a cumulative 4.68 million LTC, valued at approximately $512 million. Notably, Litecoin’s price has surged 42.3% since the buying spree began, climbing from lows of $98.42 on Feb. 4 to a 40-day peak of $136 on Feb. 19. Why Is Litecoin Price Going Up? Institutional accumulation suggests that major stakeholders are positioning ahead of a potential ETF approval. This level of sustained buying activity, despite broader market uncertainties, underscores the strategic interest in Litecoin among institutional players. The persistent buying spree among whales suggests that institutional and high-net-worth investors continue to build LTC positions as the probability of an ETF approval increases. A few factors could drive further institutional accumulation as the launch date approaches, including fulfilling reserve requirements, regulatory compliance, and portfolio diversification strategies. Institutional holders accumulating Litecoin may be looking to hold until the ETF is officially launched, capitalizing on the upside from euphoria. Likewise, OTC desks, aiming to provide operational services for brokers and exchanges listing Litecoin ETFs, could also extend their holding periods, reducing short-term circulating supply. Evidently, this narrative has played a crucial role in Litecoin’s 42% price surge over the past 14 days. If this accumulation trend continues, Litecoin’s price could extend its rally toward the highly anticipated $250 breakout level in the days ahead. LTC Price Forecast: $150 Breakout Could Trigger Further Upside Litecoin price forecast remains cautiously bullish as LTC approaches a critical resistance zone, bolstered by strong technical indicators. The recent rally has seen Litecoin climb 42.25% over the past 15 days, now trading at $135.90. This surge follows a bullish breakout from a consolidation phase, marked by a double-bottom reversal pattern. The upward trajectory has been accompanied by increasing trading volume, signaling strong market participation. Litecoin (LTC) Price Forecast The Bollinger Bands show widening volatility, with LTC now testing the upper resistance at $139.58. A decisive breakout above this level could open the door to the psychological $150 target. Parabolic SAR dots beneath the price further validate the bullish trend, suggesting sustained upward momentum. Meanwhile, the RSI at 62.46 remains below the overbought threshold, indicating room for further gains without immediate correction pressure. However, the bullish outlook faces risks. A failure to breach the $139.58 resistance could trigger a pullback toward the $117.19 mid-Bollinger level. If bearish pressure intensifies, Litecoin could revisit the Parabolic SAR support at $105.27. For now, maintaining price action above $130 keeps bulls in control, with $150 remaining a key upside target.

With the SEC’s acknowledgment , a three-week comment period has begun. This enables interested parties — investors, industry experts, and the general public — to submit comments on how the agency should assess WisdomTree’s proposal. The SEC will review these comments before determining whether to approve, reject, or postpone the application. Official comments will not start until a filing is posted in the Federal Register. Institutional interest in the XRP has recently increased significantly, as several XRP ETF applications have appeared in the Federal Register in recent weeks.

His tenure has marked a notable shift in regulatory approach, including the suspension of enforcement actions against major crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase. Uyeda has also led the creation of a new Crypto Task Force to produce a proposed framework for how the SEC will oversee digital assets. In addition, the political environment has enhanced institutional faith in crypto ETFs.

While regulatory clarity remains a concern, financial giants are positioning themselves for the next market cycle. The increasing demand for Ethereum signals confidence in its role within global finance. Meanwhile, an AI coin, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , currently priced at just $0.0420, is catching investors’ attention, promising innovation in its blockchain-powered artificial intelligence . As institutional players move strategically, these assets could define the next phase of crypto adoption. Big Banks Are Bullish On Ethereum And AI Coin Promising Exponential Gains In a significant shift within the financial sector, big banks increasingly embrace digital assets, with Ethereum and WallitIQ (WLTQ) emerging as focal points of interest. Recent data indicates that big banks’ investments in cryptocurrencies reached $17 billion in the first quarter of 2024, up from $13 billion during the same period in 2023. This surge underscores the growing confidence among big banks in the potential of blockchain technologies. Another notable development is Visa’s announcement of the Visa Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP), built on Ethereum. This platform enables Visa to issue and manage fiat-backed tokens, signaling a significant move toward crypto adoption. The initiative is set to pilot with Spanish multinational bank BBVA in 2025, highlighting the strategic interest of big banks in Ethereum’s capabilities. The convergence of big banks’ interest in Ethereum and the rise of AI coins reflects a broader trend of integrating advanced technologies into financial services. WallitIQ (WLTQ), a high-value AI coin, is leading the charge, with its presale boasting over $7 million in investments. This AI coin is attracting attention for its innovative applications, blending AI with blockchain to create decentralized solutions. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Feature-Rich Platform Gains Market Dominance Amid Institutional Adoption Reimagining crypto management, WallitIQ (WLTQ) ushers in a new era of control by introducing its feature-rich platform . This platform is a sophisticated yet intuitive wallet management system that allows users to organize their holdings. Supporting Ethereum and Tether (USDT), the recently announced app will enable users to view, track, and interact with their digital assets without the usual complexity. Sending and receiving crypto has never been easier. With WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) QR code generation for wallet addresses, the platform eliminates the hassle of manually copying and pasting long alphanumeric strings. This makes transactions quick, error-free, and secure. Investors can quickly transfer funds without worrying about losing their assets due to manual errors. WallitIQ (WLTQ) also introduces simulated transactions of ETH and USDT to external addresses, a feature that allows users to practice transactions without financial risk. Whether testing out wallet interactions or training for real-world usage, this feature provides an invaluable way to refine digital payment methods in a safe environment. Meanwhile, a key challenge for any investor is keeping up with price movements, and WallitIQ (WLTQ) confirms that users are always equipped with the latest data. Through CoinGecko API integration, real-time market tracking brings live pricing directly into the app, removing the need to switch between multiple platforms to check market trends. For a crypto platform like WallitIQ (WLTQ) , security is paramount, and this project has taken extensive measures to earn user trust. With a smart contract audit conducted by SolidProof , the platform has undergone rigorous security assessments to validate its integrity and reliability. This means investors can engage with the platform confidently, knowing that its infrastructure has been verified by one of the industry’s most respected auditing firms. Institutional Shift Strengthens Investor Confidence In WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Ongoing Presale Ethereum’s growing presence among institutional investors highlights its strengthening position in global finance. As big banks discreetly expand their ETH holdings, the market anticipates a shift that could drive long-term value. With blockchain technology reshaping industries, Ethereum, alongside an AI coin, remains at the forefront of decentralized applications and smart contract innovation. Meanwhile, the rising interest in AI-driven crypto projects , particularly an AI coin, underscores the sector’s evolving landscape. As institutional confidence in Ethereum solidifies, strategic investors closely watch Ethereum and this emerging AI coin.

While giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate, the real gains are often found in emerging projects that offer unique utility and high-growth potential. In 2025, a handful of standout cryptos are gaining traction, capturing the attention of both retail and institutional investors. Web3Bay is one such project, revolutionizing decentralized commerce with a marketplace free from middlemen, offering lower fees and seamless transactions. Alongside Web3Bay, XRP, Binance Coin (BNB), Near Protocol, and Tron are poised for significant gains, making them some of the most promising tokens to buy this year. Let’s break down why these five cryptos are set to skyrocket in 2025 and why Web3Bay is becoming a must-buy before its presale ends. 1. Web3Bay (3BAY) – The Future of Decentralized Commerce While most presales focus on speculation, Web3Bay delivers real-world utility, disrupting the trillion-dollar e-commerce sector. Unlike centralized platforms like Amazon and eBay, Web3Bay allows buyers and sellers to transact directly, reducing fees and eliminating third-party control. The project’s presale has already raised over $1.50 million, with 370 million tokens sold. Investors are flocking to 3BAY tokens, as the presale price of $0.00456 is expected to soar to $0.1959 upon launch, offering a massive 4,200% ROI for early adopters. Why Web3Bay is the Best Token to Buy in February: Decentralized Marketplace – No middlemen, lower fees, and full user control over transactions. Smart Contract Escrow – Secure, trustless transactions prevent fraud and disputes. Multi-Payment Support – Accepts both crypto and fiat payments (including PayPal). Staking Rewards – Earn passive income by holding 3BAY tokens. DAO Governance – Token holders have voting power, ensuring a community-driven ecosystem. With blockchain adoption growing, Web3Bay is set to be one of the most transformative investments of 2025. As the presale closes soon, this could be the last chance to get in before prices surge. 2. XRP (XRP) – The Cross-Border Payments Giant XRP has solidified its place as one of the most widely used digital assets in global finance, powering cross-border transactions through RippleNet. Designed to replace traditional banking systems, XRP offers faster, cheaper, and more efficient transactions than SWIFT. Recent legal victories against the SEC have reignited investor confidence, with analysts now predicting that XRP could hit $10 in this bull cycle. With ETF applications under review and institutional adoption rising, XRP’s trajectory is looking bullish. As more financial institutions adopt XRP for real-world payments, its demand is expected to surge, making it a top crypto to buy for long-term gains. 3. Binance Coin (BNB) – The Utility Powerhouse of the Binance Ecosystem Binance remains the largest cryptocurrency exchange globally, and BNB is the backbone of its ecosystem. Used for trading fee discounts, DeFi applications, and NFT transactions, BNB has immense utility and continuous demand. Binance Smart Chain (BSC) has also become a hub for DeFi and gaming projects, with billions in total value locked (TVL). As Binance expands regulatory compliance and institutional partnerships, BNB is set to be a major beneficiary. With staking rewards, DeFi integrations, and growing institutional use cases, BNB remains a top investment for long-term holders looking for stability and upside potential. 4. Near Protocol (NEAR) – The Ethereum Alternative for Fast, Low-Cost Transactions Near Protocol is emerging as a scalable alternative to Ethereum, offering high-speed transactions with minimal fees. Built for DeFi applications, NFT marketplaces, and smart contracts, NEAR’s ecosystem is rapidly expanding. With the introduction of Aurora, a Layer-2 scaling solution, NEAR now offers full Ethereum compatibility, allowing developers to migrate seamlessly. The protocol’s sharding technology ensures ultra-fast transaction processing, making it an attractive choice for developers and businesses. As blockchain adoption grows, NEAR’s efficiency and cost-effectiveness make it one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025, with potential for exponential growth. 5. Tron (TRX) – The Leader in Decentralized Finance and Digital Content Tron has positioned itself as a dominant force in DeFi, gaming, and digital content. With billions in total value locked (TVL), Tron’s ecosystem has attracted millions of users worldwide. From stablecoin transactions to DeFi lending platforms, Tron is a high-speed blockchain designed for scalability. Its low transaction fees and high throughput have made it a go-to network for developers and content creators. With more partnerships in gaming, NFTs, and Web3 applications, Tron’s ecosystem is only growing stronger. TRX remains a top investment for those looking to capitalize on DeFi and blockchain-based entertainment. Final Thoughts While established tokens like XRP, BNB, NEAR, and TRX offer strong investment potential, Web3Bay stands out as the most exciting opportunity of 2025. By reinventing e-commerce with blockchain technology, Web3Bay is tackling real-world inefficiencies, making it a high-utility token with massive upside potential. With over $1.50 million raised and presale prices set to surge, now is the best time to secure 3BAY tokens before launch. Investors looking for the next 100x opportunity in crypto should act fast—once Web3Bay hits major exchanges, early adopters could see life-changing returns. Will you wait for Web3Bay’s market debut or seize the opportunity before prices skyrocket? The choice is yours.

Chainlink price key levels are being monitored for critical support, BNB is surging, and BlockDAG’s presale is attracting attention with over $196 million raised and 18.5 billion BDAG coins distributed. Its FINALCALL700 bonus offers a 350% multiplier for early participants, a significant opportunity before BDAG’s launch. This combination of Chainlink price key levels, BNB’s surge, and BlockDAG’s presale success highlights the current market’s diverse opportunities. Let’s examine each development. Chainlink Price Key Levels in Focus Chainlink price key levels currently place $18 as a significant support area for LINK. The digital asset is currently trading around $18.53. A sustained presence above this level could propel LINK toward the $22-$25 range, a zone where it has previously seen gains. Conversely, if Chainlink price key levels break below $18, it could trigger caution among those watching the market, potentially leading to a decline towards $14. Historically, Chainlink’s upward movement has been hampered by periods of low trading volume. Chainlink price key levels also highlight the importance of technical indicators such as the MACD, which has recently signaled potential short-term strength. These Chainlink price key levels could be decisive factors in determining whether the asset experiences a steady rise or a potential downturn. BNB’s Bullish Trajectory: Riding the Wave of On-Chain Activity The recent BNB surge has drawn the attention of analysts monitoring its on-chain metrics and positive indicators. Data reveals that active addresses on the BNB Chain have reached record highs, indicating a growing level of engagement with the network. This BNB surge is further supported by the movement of tokens off exchanges by spot traders, a move often interpreted as a sign of long-term holding intentions. Market observers also note that a favorable long-to-short ratio suggests the possibility of continued gains, although the overall crypto market remains subject to volatility. The BNB surge could potentially target $793.86 if it maintains support above $605.90. Traders exercising caution point out that any shift in market sentiment could impact short-term prospects. In general, the BNB surge reflects a sense of optimism, tempered by the inherent unpredictability of the market. BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700: A 350% Bonus Bonanza BlockDAG’s presale has generated significant interest, having raised over $196 million and distributed more than 18.5 billion BDAG coins. The current price of $0.0248 represents a remarkable 2,380% increase for early participants, a return that rivals some of the most successful projects in recent memory. The FINALCALL700 bonus, offering a 350% multiplier, is viewed by many as an exceptional opportunity for those seeking substantial holdings before BDAG’s official launch. Large-volume purchases by whales indicate growing confidence in BlockDAG, as these buyers accumulate BDAG in anticipation of gains once the coin is listed on major exchanges. Analysts suggest that exceeding $200 million in presale funding is a near-term possibility, with projections of $600 million or more if current levels of interest persist. BlockDAG’s potential as a leading cryptocurrency is being discussed, with many pointing out that the highest returns often originate from presale stages. BDAG appears to fit this description for many who missed out on previous market opportunities. Those eager to avoid another missed chance are capitalizing on the 350% bonus, recognizing that such a substantial multiplier might not be available again. The combination of whale accumulation, robust presale participation, and expectations of a significant price increase upon launch has created considerable excitement around BDAG, fueling speculation that this opportunity could provide substantial returns in a short time! Market Overview The cryptocurrency market is exhibiting activity across various assets. Chainlink price key levels are holding near the $18 support, with traders assessing whether LINK can advance towards the $22-$25 range or if a drop to $14 is possible. The BNB surge continues, supported by record-high network activity and strong long-term holding. If support above $605.90 remains, BNB could see further growth. Within the realm of crypto presales, BlockDAG has garnered considerable attention, offering a 350% bonus that has the potential to deliver significant returns. With over $196 million raised and 18.5 billion coins sold, BDAG is rapidly becoming a cryptocurrency of interest for traders seeking high returns. Chainlink price key levels, BNB’s surge, and BlockDAG’s presale success all point to a market filled with opportunities and potential, but also one that requires careful observation and analysis.

However, recent technical and on-chain metrics are raising red flags, prompting savvy investors to explore more promising opportunities, such as an emerging AI-powered altcoin currently in its final presale stages . Dogecoin Price: The Bullish Market Sentiment and Looming Risks Currently trading at around $0.26, Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced a modest decline of 2% in the past 24 hours, with trading volume dropping by 45%. However, despite this short-term dip, the cryptocurrency has shown remarkable resilience, boasting a year-to-date gain of over 213%. The Dogecoin price has been buoyed by strong bullish sentiment, with 76% of top traders on Binance holding long positions and a long-to-short ratio of 3.15. This optimism is further supported by significant exchange outflows, with $18 million worth of DOGE leaving exchange wallets in the past 24 hours, signaling potential accumulation by long-term holders. From a technical perspective, Dogecoin is trading within the golden Fibonacci zone, between the 50% and 61.8% retracement levels, often considered an optimal entry point for bullish traders. The cryptocurrency also remains above the 200 Exponential Moving Average on both daily and weekly charts, reinforcing the uptrend. However, not all indicators are positive. Dogecoin’s MVRV ratio recently crossed below its 200-day moving average, forming a “Death Cross” that has historically preceded significant price declines. In late 2023, a similar event led to a 26% drop, while mid-2024 saw an even steeper 44% crash. Adding to the concerns, whale activity on the Dogecoin network has plummeted by nearly 88% since mid-November, suggesting that major investors may be losing confidence in its short-term prospects. The Dogecoin price is testing critical resistance at $0.28. Failure to break through could lead to a test of lower support levels at $0.25 or even $0.22, highlighting the inherent risks in this volatile market. This Emerging Altcoin is Attracting Smart Money Amid the uncertainty surrounding the Dogecoin price, smart money is increasingly flowing into RCO Finance (RCOF) , an emerging altcoin currently in its presale phase. RCO Finance is positioning itself as a game-changer in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, offering innovative features that promise substantial returns for early investors. Its presale, now in its fifth stage, has already seen the RCOF token price surge by 684% from its initial price of $0.01275 to its current price of $0.10. The next presale stage will see the price rise to $0.13, with further increases expected as it approaches the final presale stage at $0.2142. Upon listing on crypto exchanges, the token is projected to debut at a price range of $0.4 to $0.6, with analysts forecasting an explosive rally above $1 post-listing, driven by the platform’s unique value proposition and growing community support. The allure of RCO Finance lies in its potential for massive gains, with early investors from stage one poised to achieve returns of up to 3,000% by the time the token reaches its expected listing price. This remarkable growth trajectory, combined with the project’s deflationary tokenomics — where unsold tokens are burned to enhance scarcity — makes RCOF an attractive option for investors seeking to diversify away from the volatility of the Dogecoin price. Why RCO Finance Is the Smart Choice Besides the value proposition, smart money is flowing into RCO Finance due to its cutting-edge features and robust ecosystem, which set it apart from traditional and decentralized financial platforms. At the heart of the platform is an AI-powered Robo Advisor, a machine learning-driven tool that provides personalized investment strategies tailored to users’ financial goals, risk tolerance, and market preferences. This no-code solution democratizes access to sophisticated trading strategies, enabling both novice and seasoned investors to optimize their portfolios without intermediaries, all at a low subscription cost. Users can catch early alerts 24/7, all year, on tokens with 100x potential, like the currently trending ‘ Polkadex (PDEX) ’ coin that has taken the crypto space by storm with a 132% weekly surge. Another standout feature is RCO Finance’s KYC-free ecosystem, which prioritizes user privacy and anonymity, making it particularly appealing to privacy-conscious investors. The platform also offers access to an expansive range of over 120,000 tradable assets across 12,500 asset classes, including stocks, bonds, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate and commodities. This diversity allows users to build well-balanced portfolios that mitigate risk while maximizing returns. Adding to investor confidence, RCO Finance’s smart contract has already been audited by SolidProof , ensuring security and transparency. As the team work on finalizing the platform’s development, the recently launched beta platform has attracted over 10,000 users, providing a glimpse into its seamless automation and user-friendly interface. Currently in internal testing, the highly anticipated alpha platform launch will introduce advanced monitoring facilities, further enhancing the Robo Advisor’s capabilities. Analysts predict that post-alpha launch, the price of RCOF could explode by more than 10,000%, making it a prime target for smart money seeking exponential gains as the Dogecoin price navigates through the volatile phase.

BTC remains up ~1% year to date, but is now ~10% below its record high. Ether's closing price ticked higher this week, but ETH remains down ~20% year to date and ~45% below its all-time high. XRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and the during the first month of 2025. However, it pulled back in February and is now up only ~10% year to date. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know. We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient . Bitcoin's closing price edged lower, settling just above $95,500 - its lowest level in over five weeks. BTC remains up ~1% year to date, but is now ~10% below its record high. Ether Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second-largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article. Ether's closing price ticked higher this week, but ETH remains down ~20% year to date and ~45% below its all-time high. XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. XRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and the during the first month of 2025. However, it pulled back in February and is now up only ~10% year to date. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead. On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

An announcement will come as soon as 2nd April. The president’s recent comments at his Mar-a-Lago club specified various sectors for possible tariffs, including chips, pharma, and automotive. When reporters asked him about upcoming levies on semiconductor chips, Trump said, “It’ll be 25% and higher, and it’ll go very substantially higher over a course of a year.” However, before announcing these new tariffs, he wants companies to have ample “time to come in.” He said, “When they come into the United States and they have their plant or factory here there is no tariff, so we want to give them a little bit of a chance.” Due to increasing concerns of investors, stocks in NY declined when markets opened on Wednesday, with General Motors Co. sliding 1%. As of yet, Trump did not mention whether these tariffs will be applied to specific countries. Malaysia and Singapore are highly exposed to tariffs on chips In the case of semiconductor chips, Malaysia and Singapore are probably the most exposed right now. In 2024, Malaysia exported $136 billion worth of semiconductors, becoming the sixth largest exporter. Recently, Lawrence Wong, Singapore’s Prime Minister announced that the nation will invest $744.8 million for a new semiconductor Research and Development facility. Trump hinted at the levies on semiconductor chips just a few hours after this announcement. Executives, lobby groups, and industry experts have warned that such tariffs can cause broad ripple effects in the industry, resulting in new costs and higher consumer prices. Some countries have also promised to retaliate after the tariffs take effect. How will these tariffs impact the AI industry? After taking office, Republican lawmakers suggested ending the CHIPS and Science Act. Now, we’re looking at 25% tariffs or higher, on semiconductor chip imports. Economists warn that such dual-pronged approach would potentially harm and slow down AI research in the US, and take away the nation’s competitive edge. This is because chip production and shortage of semiconductors is the biggest bottleneck for AI’s advancement. The administration promised to support the construction of US chip foundries to reduce reliance on Asia. Washington considers it a security weakness. The Commerce Department pledged to give up to $6.6 billion to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to expand its facilities in Arizona. However, Trump says that TSMC does not need money to prioritize chip production in the United States. He said, “They needed an incentive. And the incentive is going to be they’re not going to want to pay at 25, 50 or even 100% tax.” These tariffs could prove to be painful for both the consumers and manufacturers. Even giants like Nvidia could face higher costs despite having margins to absorb them for the time being.

The company says BBRL will help people and businesses make transactions more easily and safely. The Braza Group Plans for BBRL Stablecoin It is worth mentioning that Braza Group has been in the banking sector for over 15 years. Now, with the launch of BBRL, the company is moving into digital finance. According to the announcement , Braza Group said this stablecoin will give Brazilians and businesses a secure and stable way to trade and invest without the risk of sudden price changes. Similarly, Marcelo Sacomori, chief executive officer of Braza Group, said the project will help businesses manage money more efficiently and create more business opportunities. “With BBRL, we are giving people and companies a safer way to handle digital transactions. This is about more than just a new currency—it’s about shaping the future of finance in Brazil,” he explained. In addition, the firm’s CEO confirmed that BBRL will first be available to institutional clients in early 2025. After that, individuals can access it through the Braza On app. Reasons Behind Choosing the XRP Ledger Meanwhile, the statement published by Ripple Labs’ disclosed that Braza Group chose XRPL for BBRL because it is fast, secure, and can handle large transactions. Similarly, many digital asset investors have praised XRPL for making transfers quick and affordable. To complement this, Markus Infanger, Senior Vice President of RippleX, added that the XRP Ledger is a great fit for stablecoins like BBRL. Furthermore, the firm is partnering with the Brazilian Central Bank on the DREX project. The goal is to link traditional banks with blockchain technology, allowing the Central Bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) to interact more easily through a secure system. But for now, the entity is testing different ways to use blockchain technology, including digital asset management and secure bank transactions. The XRP Ledger is known to welcome amendments regularly, so it believes the chain is the best fit. A recent XRPL amendment is the NFTokenMintOffer , which went live on the mainnet last Sunday. The XRP Ledger Innovations: RLUSD Spotlight It is worth mentioning that BBRL is not the first stablecoin on XRPL. Several other digital currencies, such as Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin, have already been released on the network. This token is gaining traction and it hit a new supply milestone earlier this week. Regarding the future growth of BBRL stablecoin on the XRPL ledger, Sacomori Estimated that by 2025, Brazil will implement more regulations to support digital assets. This would eventually make the market safer to trade, ushered in by more development. He also shared that stablecoins will soon play a pertinent role in global finance. “We expect BBRL to capture about 30% of the market by the end of next year. Stablecoins are the future of digital transactions,” he said.

A crypto analyst who identified this bearish trend in the Solana price action has projected a drastic crash to new lows at $22. Solana Price Action Mirrors LUNA’s Catastrophic Collapse A pseudonymous crypto analyst on TradingView named PizzaDriver has released a recent technical analysis of the Solana price action. The market expert predicts that Solana, the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, could soon decline to drastic lows. Related Reading: Solana Price Will Complete 1,800% Surge To $4,000 With This Formation: Analyst The analyst drew parallels between Solana’s current chart structure and the LUNA meltdown of 2022. The weekly chart highlights that Solana has formed a Double Top pattern, a classic bearish reversal signal from an uptrend to a downtrend. This pattern appears like the letter “M”, creating two peaks and a dip in between. This pattern also signifies deteriorating momentum in the Solana price, as the cryptocurrency has been facing severe volatility. In addition to the Double Top pattern, Solana’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has exhibited a bearish divergence. This means that while its price attempted to reach new highs, it was unable to due to underlying weakness. This same RSI bearish divergence was observed in LUNA before its infamous market crash, which triggered a decline to a zero level. According to the TradingView analyst, if Solana fails to hold key support levels and breaks below them, it could trigger a widespread liquidity crisis that would send its price plummeting to $22, a significant historical support level last seen in 2022. Adding to the already concerning price outlook, major institutional investors appear to have already sold their holdings and taken profits at price highs. Ahead of the bull run, these investors have reportedly reallocated funds into other somewhat safer coins like Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB), which have been seeing steady growth in on-chain activities and have risen in value over the week. This redistribution increases the risk of a rapid sell-off, further weakening Solana’s fundamentals. Rug Pulls And High Fees Weigh On Solana Beyond bearish technical indicators and price forecasts, the Solana ecosystem is currently experiencing a rise in investor dissatisfaction. PizzaDriver revealed that the Solana blockchain has become a primary space for meme coins and speculative trading. Additionally, there are allegations of rug pulls and project abandonment in the ecosystem, leaving investors with a sour experience. Related Reading: Solana Forms Ascending Triangle For Possible Breakout, Analyst Sets $565 Target Many developers have allegedly created and launched projects, stolen investors’ funds, and disappeared, thus eroding trust in the network. Moreover, Solana’s transaction fees have skyrocketed, hitting record highs and contradicting its original appeal as a low-cost transaction alternative to Ethereum. As a result, investors have begun shifting focus to long-term projects with transparent roadmaps, security audits, and strong partnerships. Due to its numerous ecosystem dilemmas, the TradingView analyst disclosed that Solana risks losing its dominant position unless it addresses these fundamental challenges.

This significant event has captured the attention of the crypto community, especially with major exchanges revealing plans to list Pi Coin. The launch will mark Pi’s transition from a closed ecosystem to a fully decentralized network. The achievement of external wallet transfers together with exchange listings and decentralized applications (dApps) develops intense interest around Pi Coin price expectations. However, there are critical risks that could impact its price post-launch. 3 Major Risks That Could Tank Pi Network’s Price After Mainnet Launch The cryptocurrency world talks intensely about Pi Network as speculations rise about its upcoming mainnet launch date. The approaching launch on February 20th has triggered rising investor and expert apprehension regarding the future path of Pi Network along with its default token, Pi. From technical issues to the potential for mass selling, there are key risks that investors should be aware of. Here, we highlight three major factors that could affect Pi’s price after its mainnet launch. Binance, the largest exchange in the world, which recently launched a vote for $Pi listing, will definitely list it. The vote was just a pretext to create a lot of hype and for the OG #crypto whales to take notice and have time to prepare. Agree? #PiNetwork #Binance #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/B4k2V9zZhO — Pi Network News Global 𝛑 (@PiNewsGlobal) February 19, 2025 Technical Indicators Show Weakness Pi price charts are currently showing signs of vulnerability, with the token slipping below key support levels. In the past 24 hours, Pi Network’s IOU token has already seen a sharp 40% decline, prompting questions about its future price movement. The price has recently fallen below the $50 support level, which was previously considered a solid support level. This technical weakness could signal a further downturn in Pi’s price, especially if the trend continues after the mainnet launch. Early Miners Could Flood the Market Pi Network has a large base of early miners who have been accumulating tokens for years. The active miners operating on mainnet will probably cash out their holdings when the mainnet launches. A substantial market downturn would likely happen if the increased supply exceeds market demand during this period. The market entry of numerous coins would intensify the existing price reduction thus deepening the downward trend. Airdrop-Based Tokens Often Drop After Launch A substantial decline in value typically happens to cryptocurrencies that make their initial releases via airdrops or similar distribution methods. When Pi Network starts trading while widening its user base it may result in market flooding through airdropped tokens that trigger immediate token dumping. The history of airdrop projects shows this pattern has become standard so Pi Network may encounter the same outcome when supply exceeds market demand. The mainnet launch of Pi Network requires investors to analyze these significant risks. Investors need to approach the market with caution while tracking Pi Network project developments along with market information.

The CoinDesk Memecoin Index will track the largest fifty memecoins by market capitalization — a list that includes dogecoin (DOGE), shiba inu (SHIB), floki (FLOKI), among others — while the CoinDesk 100 serves as a single benchmark for the top hundred tokens by market cap. “CoinDesk Memecoin Index responds to traders' need for liquidity and volatility while the CoinDesk 100 provides one-stop access to the most liquid tokens,” said Chris Tyrer, VP, head of institutional at Bullish. “We are thrilled to continue providing our clients access to the broader digital asset landscape, complementing these indices with our robust regulatory framework,"" he added. The memecoin index is equal-weighted and will be rebalanced monthly, ensuring the representation of emerging and established tokens. Similarly, the CoinDesk 100 Index is market cap-weighted and provides a single reference point for structured products, ETFs, and risk management strategies. Crypto exchange Bullish has listed perpetual futures on both indices, allowing traders to gain exposure to these benchmarks with deep liquidity and around-the-clock trading.

SecondSwap uses a liquidity routing algorithm that optimizes trade execution and minimizes price slippage to ensure secure and scalable trading experiences for buyers and sellers. “By introducing a decentralized order book-style exchange, we are bringing transparency to token secondary markets,” said Kanny Lee, founder of SecondSwap, in an email to CoinDesk. “Our platform provides visibility into buy and sell orders, leveraging price discovery mechanisms such as market depth and liquidity profiling. Through seamless wallet integration, we ensure proof of control for sellers and proof of funds for buyers, enhancing security and trust.” Secondary markets for locked tokens refer to platforms or mechanisms where tokens that are under some form of lock-up or vesting schedule can be traded before they are fully released or unlocked. These markets provide a way for holders of locked tokens to gain liquidity, meaning they can convert their holdings into cash or other assets before the tokens are fully unlocked — giving early liquidity to sellers and the chance of gaining assets at a discount for buyers. SecondSwap has introduced a bid campaign to facilitate price discovery and enhance liquidity in early weeks, allowing traders to set their own prices and support matching between buyers and sellers once the buy/sell flow feature is enabled. Traders link their wallets, accessing a list of locked tokens that they can express an interest in buying by setting their preferred price target. Participants will be notified when inventory is available at prevailing prices, ensuring early adopters can engage with new opportunities as they emerge. The platform plans to expand to the Solana network in the coming months, a feat Lee says could unlock over $500 million in volume. “Locked token liquidity represents billions of dollars of untapped value. The impact of unlocking this liquidity cannot be understated. On Solana alone, even activating just 10% of dormant liquidity, could inject over $500 million in actionable volume,” Lee said. “It’s definitely one of the drivers for partnering with Solana at the outset. When coupled with the impact that SecondSwap’s vesting mechanism can offer memecoins - to reduce circulating supply - the Solana partnership will continue to flourish and benefit the wider market.”",Markets|Ethereum,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|ETH|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-20 01:00:00

The pseudonymous analyst known as Altcoin Sherpa tells his 242,900 followers on the social media platform X that he is leaning bullish on the utility token of the decentralized open financial system Hyperliquid ( HYPE ). “Best positions right now in order of best to worst: Cash. Majors. HYPE. Utility or older coins like AAVE, LINK, XRP, OM. Everything else is pretty mehhh.” HYPE is trading for $23.27, at time of writing, down 8.8% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the trader suggests that Ethereum ( ETH ) may have an explosive move this cycle, but is uncertain when. “Everyone talking about ETH and it makes a lot of sense: Top Trump projects are on ETH ( LINK, AAVE, others). SOL is pretty screwed from a mindshare perspective (rugs/etc.). No real ETH pump (yet). ETH/BTC has been f**ed. I do believe it’ll happen, just don’t know when/how.” However, he warns that in the near term, ETH may be forming a bull trap. “ETH: I’m not going to get trapped on this one.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X ETH is trading for $2,662 at time of writing, down 2.9% in the last 24 hours. Lastly, the analyst suggests that artificial intelligence (AI)-focused altcoin Artificial Superintelligence Alliance ( FET ) and AI-related memecoin Act I: The AI Prophecy ( ACT ) may have reached their market bottoms and may be poised for breakouts “I think we’re anywhere from one month to two weeks into the consolidation period for most of these shitcoins. This is the chop period where nothing much really happens, but I still feel that most of the good ones are fairly bottomed at this point. FET, ACT are two examples.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X FET is trading for $0.72 at time of writing, down 4% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, ACT is trading for $0.18 at time of writing, up 1.3% on the day.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) is riding strong technical momentum, up 22% this month, fueled by a Golden Cross pattern and growing institutional interest. Polkadot (DOT) is holding firm above $4.8, signaling resilience in a volatile market. But while these established tokens are drawing attention, Web3Bay (3BAY) is quietly emerging as the best opportunity in 2025. Its presale has already raised $1.50 million, selling 360 million tokens in record time. Unlike speculative pumps, Web3Bay is backed by real-world utility, offering a decentralized marketplace with peer-to-peer transactions, staking rewards, and DAO governance. With early investors securing tokens at $0.00456 and an expected launch price of $0.1959, Web3Bay’s upside potential is unmatched. The race to get in early is on. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Surges 22%—Can It Break Past $30? Hyperliquid (HYPE) has gained 22% this month, positioning itself as one of the best-performing altcoins. The token saw a 7.12% jump in the past 24 hours, bringing its price closer to the $30 resistance level. With a market cap of $9.08 billion and $157.7 million in daily trading volume, investor interest is rising. Technical indicators suggest further upside. The Golden Cross formation between the 50-day and 200-day EMAs signals strong buying pressure, while the MACD remains bullish, indicating sustained momentum. If HYPE breaks above $29.90, it could rally toward $35.50. However, failure to hold current levels may lead to a pullback to $24.30 or lower support at $18.25. Polkadot (DOT) Holds Firm at $4.8—Is a Breakout to $6.2 Next? Polkadot (DOT) is showing resilience amid market volatility, holding steady above the $4.8 support level. While other altcoins struggle with uncertainty, DOT’s stability suggests strong buying interest, preventing a deeper price drop. Despite trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), DOT is attempting to push toward $6.2 resistance. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering near the 50% mark, indicating a potential shift in momentum. If RSI moves above this level, buying pressure could increase, leading to further gains. If DOT breaks $6.2, it could target $7.7 and $9.8, with a potential move toward $11.9 if bullish momentum strengthens. However, losing $4.8 support could see DOT retreat to $3.5 or even $1.9. Web3Bay: The Hottest Crypto Presale of February—Don’t Miss Out! Web3Bay is taking the crypto market by storm, rapidly advancing through its presale batches as demand surges. In just a few weeks, the project has raised over $1.50 million, with more than 360 million tokens sold. This lightning-fast progression signals strong investor confidence, and with each new batch, prices continue to rise—meaning early adopters are already locking in massive gains before the token even hits exchanges. What makes Web3Bay stand out? Unlike speculative tokens, Web3Bay is built for real-world utility, revolutionizing e-commerce with a decentralized marketplace that cuts out middlemen, lowers fees, and allows for direct peer-to-peer transactions. The project supports crypto and fiat payments, including PayPal, ensuring broad accessibility. Plus, staking rewards and DAO governance give holders long-term incentives beyond just trading. With batch prices increasing steadily, Web3Bay is shaping up to be one of the most lucrative presales of 2025. Early investors buying at $0.00456 per token are eyeing an expected launch price of $0.1959, positioning them for over 4,000% gains. The window to get in early is closing fast, and once Web3Bay hits the market, demand is expected to skyrocket. Next 100x Crypto Opportunities While Hyperliquid (HYPE) and Polkadot (DOT) offer traders potential gains, their paths remain tied to market fluctuations and resistance levels. HYPE needs to clear $30, and DOT must reclaim $6.2 for continued upside. Meanwhile, Web3Bay’s momentum isn’t tied to speculation—it’s being driven by real adoption and demand. As it disrupts the $5.7 trillion e-commerce market, Web3Bay is set to become more than just a token—it’s an entire ecosystem. With its rapidly increasing presale prices and limited token supply, early adopters have a once-in-a-cycle opportunity for 4,000%+ returns. The clock is ticking, and when Web3Bay hits exchanges, the opportunity to buy at these prices will be gone. HYPE and DOT might rise, but 3BAY is leading the next wave of crypto adoption—don’t miss it.

40564351,https://timestabloid.com/?p=57871,1740013238,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"PropiChain is the Best Altcoin to Buy Along with Dogecoin in 2025, Experts Claims",https://timestabloid.com/propichain-is-the-best-altcoin-to-buy-along-with-dogecoin-in-2025/,"In a shocking twist of events, PropiChain (PCHAIN) has topped the shortlist of the best altcoin to buy alongside Dogecoin (DOGE). This comes after most cryptos failed to meet their market predictions for Q1 2025, prompting investors to think more strategically. Thankfully, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to blaze ahead, boosting its perception as a serious investment rather than a speculative one. However, alongside Dogecoin, experts point to PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a new token they believe will rake in massive profits in 2025. Dogecoin: Why DOGE is Up and Finding The Next Best Altcoin to Buy Dogecoin (DOGE) has faced bearish trends in recent weeks but has climbed over 5.97% over the past week. Currently trading at $0.2727 , Dogecoin is at its highest mark since February 3, when the coin recovered from a drastic dip to $0.224. This spike followed the SEC’s announcement that it has received an application to create a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) from Greyscale, a leading crypto asset manager. Greyscale’s intention to create Dogecoin ETF isn’t new, but the SEC’s formal approval will get the ball rolling on the review process. Much like the Bitcoin ETF approval helped push the coin to new heights, analysts predict that the Dogecoin price will respond favorably if the SEC grants approval, even potentially making DOGE the best altcoin to buy in 2025. But even more interesting is PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a new altcoin that’s set to surge alongside Dogecoin, even mirroring the iconic 2021 DOGE rally. Aside from PropiChain’s near-identical growth pattern to Dogecoin, investors are calling PCHAIN the best altcoin to buy now due to transformative blockchain solutions for the $634 trillion real estate industry. Why PropiChain is the Best Altcoin to Buy in 2025? PropiChain (PCHAIN) is positioning itself as the next wave of innovation in a real estate market valued at roughly $634 trillion. Powered by its native PCHAIN AI altcoin, the platform merges artificial intelligence, RWA tokenization, metaverse integration, and smart contracts to streamline every aspect of property transactions. The surge in global AI investments has brought increased attention to PropiChain, which offers a suite of AI-driven features for PCHAIN holders . Personalized property searches, precise appraisals, advanced market analytics, automated trading, and round-the-clock virtual support are all part of its robust toolset. AI capabilities within the metaverse marketplace allow users to pinpoint promising properties quickly, aided by sophisticated filters that assess factors like investment potential, neighborhood trends, and historical performance. This level of detail provides an advantage in a competitive landscape, reinforced by Automated Valuation Models (AVMs) that deliver unbiased, data-backed assessments. By mapping future market fluctuations, these models help investors optimize decision-making without second-guessing. The platform’s automatic trading functionality further refines the investment experience by letting users set buy or sell targets in advance. Once those thresholds are met, trades execute instantly, capturing opportunities even when investors are away from their screens. Beyond AI, the broader PropiChain ecosystem opens the door to fractional ownership through tokenized real estate, making premium properties accessible to a wider audience. An immersive metaverse marketplace brings a global dimension to property transactions, while smart contracts simplify renting processes by automating leasing, rent collection, and renewals. This fusion of AI, tokenization, and smart contracts positions PropiChain at the leading edge of digital real estate. With projections that place PCHAIN’s growth on par with high-profile crypto rallies, analysts are notably bullish, calling PropiChain the best altcoin to buy now ahead of the coming bull run. PropiChain BlockAudit and Exchange Listings Security remains one of the top priorities in the cryptocurrency world, and PropiChain has made it clear that protecting users is a central goal. By securing a certified audit from BlockAudit (a trusted name in blockchain security), the project demonstrates a strong commitment to safeguarding its smart contracts against potential exploits or weaknesses. This verification boosts investor confidence, showing that PCHAIN’s infrastructure is robust and prepared for real-world use. Beyond its security achievements, PropiChain also benefits from being listed on CoinMarketCap . This inclusion places the project in front of a global audience of crypto enthusiasts and potential investors. Although PropiChain hasn’t yet reached major CEXs, industry observers believe such a listing could trigger a rapid and significant price increase, offering further incentive for those watching the project’s development. PCHAIN Presale Selling the Best Altcoin to Buy in 2025 for $0.011 PropiChain is currently in Stage 2 of the PCHAIN presale at just $0.011 per token, and the upcoming Stage 3 price of $0.023 suggests an easy doubling of value, even before the token appears on major exchanges. Yet the real excitement lies in a projected $3.56 target, implying a remarkable 32,400% climb from today’s price. The math is compelling: an initial $700 could grow to $226,800 if the token reaches $3.56, making PCHAIN potentially the best altcoin to buy in early 2025. Although Dogecoin (DOGE) still attracts attention and may advance toward the $1 mark, such a move would rely on a widespread crypto market rally. PropiChain (PCHAIN) , on the other hand, demonstrates tangible utility, AI-driven technology, and a clear advantage as an emerging project. Furthermore, PCHAIN operates in a massive real-estate sector, aiming to provide solutions with genuine value. Dogecoin remains well-known, but its growth prospects are constrained by limited innovation. Even if it does hit $1, the increase from its current levels would be around 400%, which is incomparable to PropiChain. With its Stage 2 presale pricing still at $0.011 and Stage 3 set to jump to $0.023, the 324x profit potential will be cut by more than half, making now the ideal time to acquire what could be the best altcoin to buy in 2025.

President Donald Trump His comments came as Bitcoin traded just shy of $96,700 on Wednesday evening, having hit an all-time high of more than $108,000 earlier this year. Trump positions the US as a global crypto leader In his presidential campaign and since his election to office, Trump has portrayed himself as a pro-digital assets sort of guy. Before being elected last year, he vowed to make the US “the crypto capital of the planet.” Since his inauguration, he’s made strides to support the industry, like appointing former regulator Paul Atkins, whom the crypto industry celebrated as a crypto-friendly agency head, to lead the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Trump also touted Miami’s position in the cryptocurrency space, calling it the “center of the action” and hinting that it could stay the heartbeat of digital asset activity. Trump noted that his administration is committed to leading America at the forefront of everything, and one of those is crypto. Trump has signed executive orders while in office to encourage the development of digital assets. In January, he signed an order that he called “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology” that formed a working group to create a federal regulatory framework for crypto. The order also aimed to prohibit a central bank digital currency (CBDC), a move supported broadly by the crypto community. Trump has criticized the SEC’s regulatory stance under former Chair Gary Gensler. The agency, which took numerous enforcement actions against crypto firms during Gensler’s tenure, had long been viewed as an antagonist to the industry. Trump claimed Wednesday that he had “totally ended that war.” Trump noted that the regulatory watchdog was really hostile to Bitcoin and crypto up until the very end. However, he noted that just before the end, they suddenly realized there were so many people on Bitcoin and crypto that they started being very nice. Trump champions crypto boom as Washington gears up for pro-digital asset legislation Trump’s comments arrived at a moment when Washington is expected to welcome its most pro-crypto Congress yet. Key lawmakers, including Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott and House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill, are leading efforts to draft regulatory frameworks for the industry. Alongside policy-oriented moves, Trump has also taken personal ownership of the crypto movement. In fact, before he even took office, he launched the TRUMP meme coin, which ballooned to billions of dollars in market capitalization. His wife, Melania Trump, soon joined him with her own cryptocurrency venture. Trump’s leadership, in particular, could further strengthen the US’s position as a dominant player in the world’s crypto economy, especially with a growing political push for adopting digital assets and a favorable regulatory environment.

Take Binance Coin (BNB), for example. When it first launched in 2017, its initial price was just $0.10 per token. Fast forward to today, and BNB has surged to over $500, making early investors millions. Those who hesitated in Binance Coin’s early days now look back with regret.

Enter Arctic Pablo Coin, the top crypto coin that’s making waves in the market with an innovative presale model and a unique growth strategy.

While some skeptics doubted its potential, early adopters saw the vision behind Binance’s ecosystem. As the Binance exchange expanded, so did the utility of BNB, driving its price up. By 2021, Binance Coin reached an all-time high of $690. Imagine investing $1,000 in BNB’s ICO—you’d now have millions. Unfortunately, many missed this golden opportunity, dismissing it as just another token. The key takeaway? Spotting potential early and seizing the moment can be life-changing in the crypto space.

The Blockchain Association also pointed out in a letter to the leaders of both houses and parties that the IRS rule extends the definition of a “broker” to mean software through which users interact with DeFi protocols. The group also noted that the current change could put too much pressure on developers working on DeFi systems. That rule affects software companies that do not have possession of personal property by requiring them to gather and disclose personal identifying data and transaction details. The Blockchain Association explained that compliance would change the DeFi software dramatically and even necessitate some middlemen for reports. According to Kristin Smith, the CEO of the Blockchain Association, the group has already embarked on a legal battle regarding the rule. However, she said that getting Congress to repeal it would take a shorter time compared to any other course of action. Impact on U.S. DeFi innovation The Blockchain Association also argued that allowing the rule to proceed would be detrimental to the United States’ dominance in DeFi and financial technology. The letter clarified that the regulation solely targets domestic DeFi firms, while international companies providing the same services to U.S. consumers are not affected. The group explained that this imbalance may slow down domestic innovation, though it may push some projects offshore. “Second, the rule raises privacy and surveillance concerns. It requires DeFi industry participants to collect and store users’ personal identifying information, and to report transaction details to the IRS. This is a dramatic infringement that disincentivizes innovation.” The Blockchain Association Ron Hammond, the senior director of government relations of the association was optimistic that the rule would be repealed across the parties. He cited similar sentiments in 2021 when issues to do with regulation of decentralized finance, DeFi, held up the infrastructure bill. Hammond criticized what he described as overregulation by the Biden administration and asserted the industry is not in the phase of learning anymore. He underscored the need for policy and regulation that promote innovation but effectively shield consumers. He also noted that DeFi is gaining support from the finance and banking authorities, explaining that sentiments are changing as Trump has vowed to make America the leader in cryptocurrency. Other crypto organizations have also expressed a lot of concern about the IRS rule. The DeFi Education Fund hailed the growing trend as a response to what it termed as unworkable and unconstitutional regulation.

This marks a key step in the bloc’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation. However, the absence of Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, has raised concerns about regulatory priorities and the potential consequences for the digital asset market. Tether Misses Out as EU Grants MiCA Approval to 10 Stablecoin Providers The largest stablecoin issuer, Tether, was noticeably absent from the list of ten firms authorized under MiCA regulations to issue stablecoins in the EU. The approved entities include Banking Circle, Circle, Crypto.Com, Fiat Republic, Membrane Finance, Quantoz Payments, Schuman Financial, Societe Generale, StabIR, and Stable Mint. These firms have issued ten euro-pegged stablecoins and five US dollar-pegged stablecoins. Despite Tether’s $141 billion market capitalization, the company did not receive approval, which means crypto platforms have begun delisting USDT for EU-based users. Alongside stablecoin issuers, 11 MiCA-authorized Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) were approved across Germany, the Netherlands, and Malta. These providers offer services in trading, exchange, execution, custody, and transfers within the EU regulatory framework. Expanding Operations Beyond the EU With growing regulatory restrictions in the EU, Tether has continued to expand its operations in other regions. The stablecoin issuer recently proposed to acquire a 51% stake in a South African energy company, signaling a shift in focus toward investments outside of digital assets. Tether’s exclusion from MiCA-approved stablecoin issuers raises questions about the EU’s regulatory approach. The company expressed disappointment over the decision, stating that the delistings were “hasty and unwarranted.” However, MiCA’s rules require stablecoin issuers to meet specific compliance standards. Similarly, Tether has expanded into the sports industry, recently investing in Juventus to strengthen its presence in mainstream sectors. This move aligns with its broader strategy of integrating digital assets, AI, and biotech into traditional industries. MiCA Rules To Isolate the EU Crypto? Industry experts caution that the strict regulations under MiCA could isolate the EU’s digital asset market. Natalia Łątka, Director of Public Policy and Regulatory Affairs at Merkle Science, suggested that the EU’s regulatory stance may discourage foreign firms from operating in the region. She also noted that local crypto companies could consider relocating outside the EU to avoid restrictions associated with MiCA compliance. Additionally, some analysts argue that the EU’s regulatory focus on compliance over innovation could reduce market competitiveness. While MiCA aims to provide clarity and stability, critics believe it may lead to fewer options for European crypto users. This pushes firms toward jurisdictions with more flexible regulations.

Meet Mutuum Finance (MUTM),https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-this-cheap-altcoin-be-the-next-cardano-ada-meet-mutuum-finance-mutm/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently racing through the opening phase of its presale, raising over $774,320 and attracting 1,320 holders in a matter of days. With more than 70% of Phase 1 tokens already sold at $0.01 each, investors are scrambling to secure their stakes in a project analysts are calling a potential rival to Cardano (ADA). Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines decentralized lending solutions, an overcollateralized stablecoin, and a price-stabilizing buyback system, features positioning it for a 600% surge to $0.06 at launch. Experts further predict a staggering 100x climb to $1 in 2025, making this presale a rare chance to enter a high-growth DeFi ecosystem at ground level. Mutuum Finance Redefining Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another token; it’s a functional platform addressing real gaps in decentralized finance. The protocol enables users to lend or borrow digital assets through two models: peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P). Lenders deposit assets like USDT into liquidity pools, earning adjustable interest rates tied to borrowing demand. Borrowers, meanwhile, leverage crypto collateral to access liquidity while retaining ownership, a feature appealing to long-term investors avoiding forced asset sales. The P2C model relies on audited smart contracts for security, while P2P transactions let users negotiate terms directly. Both systems prioritize flexibility, transparency, and reduced risk, setting Mutuum Finance apart in a crowded market. By Phase 4, the platform plans a full launch, integrating an overcollateralized stablecoin backed by on-chain reserves. This addition will streamline borrowing processes and enhance price stability, further boosting MUTM’s utility-driven demand. Presale Momentum Builds Ahead of Beta Launch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capitalizing on its early momentum, with Phase 1 selling out rapidly and subsequent stages set to incrementally raise the token price to $0.06. Investors buying now could lock in a 6x return by launch day, a figure grounded in the project’s structured presale model, not speculative hype. The team has also announced a $100,000 giveaway for early participants, incentivizing community growth ahead of its exchange debut. Adding to the urgency, Mutuum Finance plans to release a beta version of its lending platform alongside the token launch. This operational product will immediately drive user adoption, transaction volume, and liquidity, critical factors for sustaining MUTM’s post-launch growth. Unlike projects reliant on vague roadmaps, Mutuum Finance delivers tangible utility from day one, a key reason analysts are bullish on its $1 target in 2025. Why MUTM Outshines Cardano (ADA) in Utility While Cardano (ADA) has cemented itself as a blockchain pioneer, its focus on scalability and smart contracts lacks the immediate financial incentives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers. MUTM’s lending protocols and stablecoin integration create direct revenue streams for users, blending passive income with capital appreciation. Additionally, the buy-and-distribute mechanism allocates a portion of platform fees to purchase MUTM from the market, redistributing tokens to stakers. This built-in demand driver ensures continuous buying pressure, a feature absent in most Layer 1 tokens like ADA. The presale’s tiered pricing structure further advantages early adopters. With Phase 1 nearly exhausted, entry prices will rise in subsequent stages, rewarding those who act swiftly. A $1,500 investment today could balloon to $10,500 at launch and potentially $150,000 if MUTM hits $1 in 2025, a trajectory supported by its deflationary tokenomics and expanding user base. As the crypto market develops, projects offering real-world utility and structured growth are dominating. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) checks every box: a low presale price, explosive short-term gains, and a long-term vision anchored in DeFi’s expanding role. With Phase 1 slots dwindling, the window for securing tokens at $0.01 is closing fast. The question isn’t whether Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could follow Cardano’s (ADA) success, it’s whether investors will recognize this opportunity before the presale concludes. Those who act now position themselves for a 600% return at launch and a potential 100x surge in 2025.

Earlier this year, ADA surged past $1.15, but by February, it tumbled to $0.68; a 40% drop. The recent 15% rebound has helped recover some losses, but technical indicators suggest that growth may be stalling. A closer look at Cardano price charts reveals a descending triangle formation, often signaling a potential breakdown rather than a bullish recovery. If Cardano price remains trapped under key resistance, it could dip back to $0.72, with further selling potentially pushing it to $0.66. However, if buying pressure strengthens, ADA could reclaim $0.90 and eventually challenge the $1 mark again. While ADA stabilizes, investors are looking elsewhere for high-growth opportunities, and one project catching attention is RCO Finance . Unlike ADA, which has already established itself and slowed down, RCOF is in its early stages; meaning its upside potential is massive. This AI Crypto Is Built for Smarter Investing and Bigger Profit Crypto investors are always on the lookout for ways to maximize profits, and RCO Finance delivers exactly that with its game-changing AI-powered Robo Advisor. Unlike traditional investments where you need to constantly analyze charts, follow news, and time your trades, RCOF does all the heavy lifting for you. The Robo Advisor scans the market in real time, gathering data from sources like Bloomberg and Reuters to pinpoint optimal entry and exit points. This means you no longer need to guess when to buy or sell. For example, the PEPE token surged over 10,000% just a few days after it launched but most people got in after that surge. The Robo Advisor would have identified patterns and alerted you to it before that surge. But it’s not just about spotting winners; it also detects downturns, helping you exit before prices crash. And the Robo Advisor continuously adapts to market trends and your personal investment style, optimizing your portfolio for better performance. Whether you’re a conservative investor looking for steady growth or an aggressive trader chasing big gains, the AI fixes strategies to fit your goals. Beyond AI, RCO Finance offers features that traditional crypto platforms simply don’t. Investors can diversify into over 120,000 assets, including bonds, ETFs, and tokenized real estate, all within a single ecosystem. Also, RCOF’s debit card lets you spend your crypto holdings seamlessly. And best of all, the platform is completely KYC-free, meaning you can trade, invest, and spend without invasive verification processes. Presale Gains and Future Growth Make RCOF the Top Bet for 2025 RCO Finance is already proving its value with a fully operational Beta Platform . Unlike most crypto projects that launch without a working product, RCOF has over 10,000 active users testing its features. The team is now refining its Alpha version, which will introduce even more powerful AI enhancements. The presale is currently in its 5th stage, with tokens selling at $0.10. But time is running out; once the next stage kicks in, the price jumps to $0.13, an instant 30% gain. With over $13 million raised so far, momentum is building fast, and early buyers are locking in their positions before RCOF gets listed on major exchanges. Let’s put this into perspective. A $1,000 investment at this stage grows to $1,300 when the next stage launches. But that’s just the beginning. Once RCOF hits major listings and demand skyrockets, we’re looking at potential 10,000x gains. That same $1,000 could turn into $100,000 if RCOF follows the trajectory of past crypto success stories. SolidProof, a top blockchain auditing firm, has verified that RCOF is fully secure with no vulnerabilities, so you can invest without worries. ADA’s Slow Growth vs. RCOF’s Rapid Momentum, Which One Wins? While ADA remains a solid choice for long-term holders, its growth has slowed dramatically. Even if the Cardano price reaches $1.50, that’s only a 2x return. Compare that to RCOF , a brand-new project with faster adoption, stronger real-world utility, and a rapidly expanding presale. Investors who got in early have already seen gains, and those who wait risk missing out. The next presale stage alone increases the price by 30%, and by the time it lists, early adopters could be sitting on life-changing returns. The window of opportunity is closing fast, and delaying just a few weeks could mean watching RCOF skyrocket from the sidelines instead of profiting from its rise. If Cardano price is moving at a slow pace, RCOF is speeding toward massive success; making now the best time to jump in.

Web3Bay is rewriting the rules of decentralized commerce, rapidly advancing through its presale while offering real utility and 6,000% return potential. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) is positioned for a breakout to $260, with bullish technical indicators pointing to a strong rally. Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, is at a crossroads, struggling to hold $2,500 as market sentiment wavers. ‘ For investors, this isn’t just another price cycle—it’s a chance to position early before the biggest gains materialize. Web3Bay’s record-breaking presale momentum proves that smart money is already moving. Will you act before the window closes, or will you be left watching from the sidelines? Solana (SOL) Gears Up for a Potential Surge to $260—Can It Hold Key Support? Solana (SOL) is showing signs of strength as it trades within a well-defined parallel channel. Analysts suggest a possible breakout, with price targets between $225 and $260, provided it maintains key support at $190. Technical indicators favor an upward move. The MACD has turned bullish, hinting at growing momentum, while Fibonacci retracement points to $225 as a critical pivot for further gains. If SOL stays above support, it could rally toward these targets. Market sentiment leans bullish, with long positions outweighing shorts and open interest rising, signaling investor confidence. A surge in futures activity suggests traders are positioning for a breakout. Ethereum (ETH) Teeters Near $2,500—Can It Avoid a Bigger Drop? Ethereum’s price has struggled to regain momentum after repeated rejections at $4,000 in December. Currently trading below the 200-day moving average at $3,000, ETH is testing resistance near $2,700. A successful breakout could signal a bullish reversal, but failure may push ETH toward $2,350 or even $2,000. On the 4-hour chart, Ethereum is consolidating, with RSI nearing 50%, hinting at weakening momentum. A drop below this threshold could trigger further selling pressure. Investors should watch $2,700 closely—a decisive move above it could change the trend, while rejection may lead to deeper losses. Can Ethereum hold firm, or is a bigger drop inevitable? Web3Bay: The Next Amazon of Crypto—A Rare 6,000% Opportunity Imagine investing in Amazon in its early days—before it became the e-commerce giant it is today. Those who saw its potential and got in early made life-changing returns. Web3Bay is following a similar trajectory, bringing decentralized commerce to the blockchain while eliminating high fees and middlemen. As a Web3-powered marketplace, it allows users to buy and sell goods seamlessly using crypto and fiat, including PayPal, making it one of the most practical and scalable blockchain projects today. The presale is moving at lightning speed—$1.50 million raised and 360 million tokens sold in just weeks. Each batch sells out fast, with prices increasing at every stage. Investors buying now at $0.00456 per token are looking at a projected launch price of $0.1959, meaning 6,000% potential gains post-listing. Opportunities like this don’t come often—early movers are locking in exponential profits before Web3Bay goes mainstream. Will you? One Clear Winner—The Time to Move Is Now While Solana’s bullish momentum and Ethereum’s uncertain future keep traders guessing, Web3Bay is delivering real, measurable success. Its presale has already raised $1.50 million, with 360 million tokens sold in weeks, and prices rising at every batch. Early investors at $0.00456 are securing 6,000% returns post-listing, a rare opportunity before the token hits major exchanges. Solana may reach $260, and Ethereum could recover, but Web3Bay isn’t just another speculative asset—it’s a true disruptor in blockchain commerce. The presale is selling out fast, and history shows that early movers in high-utility projects see the biggest returns. The choice is clear—position now or risk missing one of the biggest crypto investment opportunities of 2025. Will you seize it or sit back and watch?

Although still shy of the coveted $100,000 mark, the leading cryptocurrency shows signs of resilience. This recovery is unfolding against the backdrop of mixed market signals, prompting analysts to weigh the potential for continued bullish momentum versus the risk of a near-term pullback. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Persistent Resistance at $100K, Analyst Eyes Next Step Bitcoin’s Market Momentum at a Crossroads One recent analysis from Onchain Edge, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, highlights Bitcoin’s current “critical decision zone.” Using two key indicators—the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio and the MVRV Ratio—Onchain Edge’s findings suggest a market that is not yet overvalued, though caution flags remain. While the overall on-chain data leans more positive, the contrasting signals highlight the precarious position of Bitcoin’s current rally. From a bullish perspective, the MVRV Ratio—an indicator that compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value—stands at 2.21, well below the levels that typically signal market tops (3.5–4.0). This suggests that Bitcoin’s current valuation is not overstretched, leaving room for further upside. Moreover, other indicators such as the Puell Multiple reinforce the notion that Bitcoin has not yet reached overbought conditions. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, if these macro indicators hold steady and buyers return in force, Bitcoin could continue its upward trajectory, potentially reclaiming six-figure territory before any substantial correction sets in. Possible Bearish Signals on the Horizon Despite these promising signs, the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, which gauges market sentiment by comparing aggressive buy and sell orders, stands at 0.96—below the 0.98 threshold often associated with bullish strength. Onchain Edge reveals that historically, levels around this range have preceded market corrections, as was the case during peaks in March and November of 2021. Should Bitcoin fail to break above resistance, this ratio could hint at a short-term top. A sustained failure to climb past current levels may trigger a temporary pullback, providing a cooling-off period before any subsequent rally. As Bitcoin hovers near this pivotal price point, the market remains finely balanced between cautious optimism and potential downside risk. Onchain Edge concludes that maintaining a level above $95,000, combined with a resurgence in buying activity, could pave the way for a move to new highs.

While the bull cycle appears intact, the coming days may determine whether Bitcoin’s current rally has enough fuel to continue, or if a pause is on the horizon.

33767162,[object Object],1740018617,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Bitcoin 9-Month Cycle Says It’s Not Over, Analyst Shows Where We Are In The Bull Run",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-9-month-cycle/,"The Bitcoin price action is currently following a pattern seen in previous bull runs, suggesting that its 9-month cycle may not be over yet. According to a crypto analyst, historical data from past Bitcoin cycles shows precisely where the market is in the current bull run . These past trends reveal that the market may be caught in a bear trap. What Bitcoin Past Cycles Say About The Market’s Current Position Crypto analyst Cyclop on X (formerly Twitter) shared historical data of past Bitcoin bull run cycles to determine the exact position of the current market. The analyst revealed that during the bull rally in 2011, 2013, 2017, and 2021, Bitcoin experienced a recurring nine-month bull market, with a bear trap phase occurring around month 5 or 6. A bear trap is a temporary price decline that misleads traders and investors into believing that the bull market is over , triggering a massive sell-off and spreading fear. Unlike the normal bear market, which involves prolonged periods of decline and volatility, a bear trap swiftly recovers and continues on its former bullish momentum. According to the Cyclops chart, the Bitcoin market has likely entered its bear trap phase, aligning with patterns from previous bull run cycles . In 2011, Bitcoin saw a nine-month bull run, with a bear trap occurring in the sixth month. The only exception to this six-month trend was in 2013 when the bear trap emerged in the fifth month instead. If Bitcoin’s market were to follow this historical data, as the analyst suggests, then it would mean that the cryptocurrency has possibly entered the 6-month bear trap. This trend is typically followed by stages of renewed optimism, Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO), and Euphoria at the peak before the next market correction. Currently, the Bitcoin price has declined significantly below the $100,000 threshold and is now trading at $95,767. Based on CoinMarketCap’s reports, the pioneer cryptocurrency declined by over 11% in the past month and has failed to recover enough gains to push it back to previous highs. Factors like US President Donald Trump’s tariffs , ongoing market volatility and changes in sentiment have had a severe impact on the Bitcoin market and broader cryptocurrencies. Crypto Community Reacts With Mixed Views While Cyclop believes that the current market has possibly entered a bear trap, crypto community members argue that it is still in a bull run. One member, B. Rich disclosed that rather than a bear trap, the market was likely experiencing a shakeout. He predicts that the bear trap would come into play when the Bitcoin price hits or pulls back around the $200,000 level due to various psychological reasons. He also believes that a long-term super cycle may be in the books super cycle may be in the books for BTC, with current bearish sentiment quickly transforming into FOMO.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Coinmarketcap|Cyclop|Donald Trump|fomo,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-20 02:30:17

BTC is rising within a range and might revisit the $98,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin started a decent recovery wave above the $95,500 zone. The price is trading above $96,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $96,700 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $96,000 zone. Bitcoin Price Recover Losses Bitcoin price formed a base above the $93,500 level and started a recovery wave . BTC was able to surpass the $94,000 and $94,200 resistance levels. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $98,825 swing high to the $93,288 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $96,700 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair even surpassed the $96,500 level and now faces hurdles near the $96,800 zone. Bitcoin price is now trading above $96,200 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $96,800 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $98,825 swing high to the $93,288 low. The first key resistance is near the $97,200 level. The next key resistance could be $98,000. A close above the $98,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $98,800 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $99,500 level or even $100,000. Another Decline In BTC?
