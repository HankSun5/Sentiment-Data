52119572,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/rwa-sector-boom-blockchain-meets-real-estate/,1758582000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52119572.jpeg,RWA Sector Boom: Blockchain Meets Real Estate,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/rwa-sector-boom-blockchain-meets-real-estate/,"The convergence of blockchain technology and real estate is quickly being recognized as one of the most lucrative areas of impact in digital finance. Real-world assets (RWA) – especially tokenized property – are opening up new opportunities in ownership and investment in a manner never before imagined. Although the crypto market at large has experienced highs and lows, the RWA market is gradually picking up as analysts identify real estate tokenization as a trillion-dollar market that is yet to emerge. The future of emerging projects is also taking this trend. Actually, initial projects, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, have already begun to draw the attention of investors due to their potential for exponential growth in the future, indicating that the next crypto breakout will be a token associated with practical use, rather than just speculation. Tokenization Gains Momentum The idea of tokenization is not complicated but radical: by turning physical assets into tokens stored in blockchains, markets, which were historically accessible only to wealthy individuals, can be opened to an entirely greater number of participants. The real estate industry is spearheading the wave. Million-dollar properties can now be fractionalized into digital tokens, and an investor can own a fraction of a property without having to buy the full property. Market analysts feel that this innovation has the potential to transform the property market in terms of liquidity, transparency, and inclusivity. Blockchain-based platforms simplify the process, unlike conventional real estate deals, which involve paperwork and legal barriers that also require a lot of capital. In theory, a property in New York, London, or Dubai can be tokenized and sold to all investors all over the world, exposing them to high-value assets. ESX and the Emerging RWA Market ESX is one of the projects that is leading such a change. Analysts indicate that the token just reached a major support level, and traders are paying attention to it because they anticipate that the price will move within the current range. Although short-term technical analysis indicates that ESX can experience volatility, it is in the watchlist of most investors due to its presence in the thriving RWA industry. More to the point, ESX puts into focus the bigger picture: tokenization of real estate is not a passing trend. Demand for blockchain-based property investments could skyrocket as retail investors re-enter the market. According to the analysts, capital flows between traditional and digital markets in the future will be defined by the infrastructure currently being laid by projects such as ESX. A New Opportunity Steps Into the Spotlight As ESX and other players in RWA are establishing their stakes, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a project with an entirely different perspective, though it has an equally promising potential. Already, investors are acknowledging that it is comparable to the SHIBA INU early days and DOGECOIN , where a tiny presale can quickly become a megabrand in the market. The only difference between MAGACOIN FINANCE and the others is its trajectory, which at an early stage is likely to yield gains that traditional markets can hardly provide. The project is building a market where demand is always outpacing supply due to limited access seen in the first wave and sellouts at a very fast rate in each round of funding. Analysts propose that this imbalance would precondition potential exponential returns as soon as MAGACOIN FINANCE gets listed on big exchanges. The narrative here is on timing. Since the RWA industry proves the importance of blockchain as an asset that allows connecting classic goods with online networks, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the opposite end of the spectrum: a presale initiative with an unbelievable growth potential supported by community, scarcity, and milestones of strategic development. To prospective investors, the two accounts emphasize the fact that crypto is no longer limited to speculation – it is opening the door to completely new value creation. Why Real Estate Matters for Crypto The largest asset class in the world is real estate, which is worth more than $300 trillion. It has been restricted over the decades by entry barriers, geographical constraints, and bulky management systems. Blockchain provides an opportunity to realize this value through dynamic and tradable assets of real estate. Proponents claim that tokenized properties would act similarly to stocks, where they can be sold and bought instantly, but they will have the advantage of immutability that blockchain provides. This, in its turn, would bring on board institutional players that have been reluctant to join crypto but would be willing to invest in property. Giving real estate an online portfolio might allow crypto markets to be more resilient and attract new liquidity. Early Stages, Long-Term Potential In spite of the enthusiasm, most of the experts believe that the RWA movement has not left its early stage yet. Regulatory transparency, legal frameworks, and infrastructure development are obstacles. Nevertheless, the improvement that is being achieved is undisputed. Already, countries with progressive regulators are piloting tokenized property programs, and blockchain companies are competing to establish themselves as leaders in the field. It is thought by industry observers that the next wave of the market might speed up adoption. The partnership between blockchain and real estate may become a powerful trend as investors seek other assets to invest in. The concept of tokenization is more than a fractionalization of ownership; rather, it is the redefinition of access, new liquidity, and the bridging of two markets that amount to trillions of dollars. Conclusion The RWA industry has been booming, which demonstrates that blockchain is already starting to integrate with more traditional finance in significant ways, with real estate tokenization in the spotlight. The use of tokenized assets such as ESX is a trend that is becoming popular, whereas MAGACOIN FINANCE is a type of opportunity that is equally large in potential growth and is, in fact, reminiscent of the history of major breakout coins . With the current development of the crypto market, investors are on high alert to find the next source of adoption and returns. It could be tokenized property’s new financial avenues or new tokens constructing communities that are going to blow up, the tide is definite: blockchain is spreading into new areas previously considered untouched.

TD Sequential Has Just Given A Buy Signal For Bitcoin In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential has just formed a signal for Bitcoin on its 4-hour price chart. The TD Sequential is an indicator from technical analysis (TA) that’s used for locating potential points of reversal in an asset’s price. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready To Bark Again? Analyst Sees Path To $0.45 The indicator involves two phases. In the first of these, known as the setup, it counts candles of the same color up to nine. Once the ninth candle is in, it gives a turnaround signal for the asset. Naturally, the signal is a buy one if the preceding candles were red and a sell one if they were green. As soon as the setup is over, the second phase, called the countdown, kicks off. The countdown works much like the setup, with the key difference being that the indicator counts up thirteen candles here, not nine. Following these thirteen candles, the price trend is considered to have reached exhaustion once more. In other words, the asset may have reached another top or bottom. Bitcoin has completed a TD Sequential phase of the first type recently. Below is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the signal forming in BTC’s 4-hour price. From the graph, it’s visible that the TD Sequential has completed this setup with nine red candles, which implies Bitcoin may have arrived at some sort of bottom. The signal has come as the cryptocurrency’s price has plummeted and retraced its recent recovery. It now remains to be seen whether the buy setup will hold, or if there is more decline coming for the asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Plunges 6.7% As Social Media Shows Overhype In another X post, the analyst has talked about a potential pattern forming for Bitcoin that could also point to a bullish outcome. As displayed in the above chart, Bitcoin’s 4-hour price has potentially been following an inverse head-and-shoulders. This pattern appears whenever an asset’s price registers a low (called the head) between two higher lows (the shoulders). BTC has formed the left shoulder and head so far, with the right shoulder possibly brewing with the price crash. In the scenario that the right shoulder does get confirmed, a bullish breakout may follow for the cryptocurrency, since an inverse head-and-shoulders is generally considered to be a bullish reversal pattern. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $112,300, down over 2.5% in the last 24 hours.

Market sentiment has been building around October 2025 , with a crypto pundit pointing to a lineup of events that could reshape XRP’s future trajectory. At the center of this buzz are multiple deadlines tied to spot XRP ETF applications . These pending decisions have fueled both optimism and caution, as market observers weigh the potential impact on price action and institutional adoption. Why October Could Be A Gamechanger For XRP Market analyst CryptoSensei has put October firmly on the radar of XRP investors. Declaring the upcoming month a “game-changer,” the analyst shared a timeline of pending XRP ETF decision dates scheduled through mid-October. In the span of just one week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are expected to deliver rulings on seven applications from some of the biggest names in finance, including Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, Canary Capital, WisdomTree, Franklin Templeton, and CoinShares. The timeline kicks off with Grayscale’s CoinDesk Crypto 5 ETF (GDLC) on October 16, followed by 21Shares Core XRP ETF Trust on October 20. The pace picks up the next week with Canary Capital’s ETF on October 23 and the WisdomTree XRP Fund on October 24, leading into a major double decision day on October 25, when Franklin Templeton and CoinShares’ XRP ETF are set to receive rulings. The sheer concentration of these deadlines is already fueling optimism in XRP’s future price action as well as speculation that the cryptocurrency could finally achieve the regulatory breakthrough it has been chasing for years. Approval of even one spot ETF would open the floodgates for institutional money , but multiple green lights could create a domino effect unlike anything the XRP market has experienced. How The XRP ETF Could Drive Growth Crypto analyst and XRP advocate, identified as “589CTO” on X social media, has added more depth to the ETF discussions, explaining why October’s rulings carry significant weight and how they could affect price action . He pointed out that once the US SEC grants approvals, trading could begin almost immediately—just as it did for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs earlier in 2024. Notably, the analyst highlighted that the US SEC typically has up to 240 days to review a 19b-4 filing , which is required for exchanges to list a new ETF. Additionally, the regulator will have to approve the S-1 form filed by the ETF issuer before official trading can commence. While Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs saw dips shortly after their approvals, despite months of anticipation, they eventually brought billions in inflows into the market. If XRP follows the same path, the crypto market expert predicts that the market could first see volatility before structural growth and demand, which could eventually fuel an increase in value.",XRP|19b-4 Filing|21Shares|589CTO|Bitwise|Canary Capital|CoinShares|CoinShares’ XRP ETF|CryptoSensei|Franklin Templeton|gdlc|Grayscale|Grayscale’s CoinDesk Crypto 5 ETF|ripple|S-1 form|Spot Bitcoin ETFs|spot Ethereum ETFs|Spot XRP ETFs|US SEC|wisdomtree|WisdomTree XRP Fund|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-22 23:00:44

Despite the dip, the narrative around institutional adoption remains strong. Ethereum briefly stole the spotlight after BitMine Immersion, led by Tom Lee, purchased $1.1 billion worth of ETH, making it the largest public Ethereum holder. That move triggered a 10% dip in BitMine’s shares, as market participents digested both the buying and a new equity raise.

Metaplanet Expanded Bitcoin Treasury With 5,419 BTC On the other hand, Japan’s Metaplanet also expanded its Bitcoin treasury with 5,419 BTC worth $633 million. It has raised total to 25,555 BTC valued at nearly $3 billion. That makes it the fifth-largest corporate holder worldwide, even as its stock faces short-term selling pressure.

Despite short-term stock pullbacks, the firm’s Bitcoin (BTC) yield has already reached 10.3% in under three months, reinforcing market confidence in crypto treasuries. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook On the technical front, the BTC/USD price chart displays a head-and-shoulders reversal after the $115,000 support level was breached and the price slipped from its rising channel. Price is testing the 200-EMA at $113,450, a critical pivot level. Failure to recover it could drag BTC toward $110,850, with deeper support at $108,750 and $107,250. Momentum indicators lean bearish. The RSI at 31 signals oversold conditions, but without bullish confirmation—such as a hammer or engulfing candle—buyers remain cautious. A clean rebound above $114,750–$116,150 would shift sentiment, opening the path back to $118,000. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview For now, aggressive traders may short below $115,000, while patient investors might wait for confirmation near $110,800. The longer-term structure of higher lows since summer remains intact, suggesting the current dip may be an accumulation zone. With corporate buyers active and regulatory clarity improving, Bitcoin could recover lost ground and position for a renewed rally toward $120,000 and beyond as 2026 approaches. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining BTC’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $17.5 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012955—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses.

Ethereum (ETH) continues to be a bedrock of the market because of smart contracts and existing infrastructure. Nevertheless, for individuals seeking further growth opportunities, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing increasing attention. Still priced at $0.035 presale, MUTM is building a lending-and-borrowing protocol framework designed for real DeFi utility, which positions it as a much more scalable project than large-cap tokens like ETH. As altcoin season ramps up, there are many individuals who believe that Mutuum Finance is the better play for outsize return. Ethereum Sustains Above $4,400 Ethereum (ETH) is priced at $4,460.96 at the moment, holding its ground as buyers roll into altcoins amidst a strong cycle for the market. On-chain activity, institutional buying through spot ETFs, and declining balances on exchanges are all driving demand, though the asset still continues to face resistance in the $4,600–$4,700 range as well as changes in staking dynamics. While Ethereum still finds itself at the center of the overall ecosystem, MUTM is being seen to have comparatively more room to expand. Mutuum Finance to Reshape DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently under way. Stage 6 presale token buyers can purchase MUTM for $0.035. Over 16,470 investors have bought tokens already, and the project has seen over $16.15 million worth of investments, a sign of high market demand and global launch anticipation. MUTM dynamically hedges volatility and liquidity in a manner that makes it possible for it to short illiquid positions on good terms. There is no risk exposure with very low liquidation points. It is paired with ETH and stablecoins and other risk levels of LTV backed by less risky assets. It has a proportionally distributed reserve factor by asset class and one which optimizes the protocol reserve safety. Mutuum Finance employs Chainlink oracles to provide collateral to lend, exchange and settle trades in USD-denominated value of assets and token value of assets like ETH, MATIC and AVAX. Fallback oracle modes, composite data feeds and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages are employed as fail-safes. Price of supply data may be as accurate as possible even in hard-hitting market conditions in multi-layered form. Mutuum Finance also offers an early adopter token giveaway with $100,000 giveaway and 10 lucky individuals getting rewarded with $10,000 MUTM. Volatility in the market is the greatest source of collateral management for protocols. Asset stability is used in LTV and liquidation depeg. Both a minimum and a maximum are used in whether tokens are risky or not. Reserved proportional multiplication is used from 10% less risk to 35% riskier in a non-diversification-killing way. Mutuum Finance is developing a passive lending and borrowing protocol that will leverage active capital management with the aim of allowing users to borrow against securitised assets. It operates the platform on a stability algorithm and an interest rate optimisation algorithm on drivers of efficiency and long-term capital use resilience. The Best Altseason Pick Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting solid interest as the Altcoin Season Index increases, offering growth potential better than large-cap tokens like Ethereum (ETH). At Stage 6 of its presale at $0.035, MUTM has already captured $16.15M+ from 16,470+ investors, indicating high demand. Its DeFi protocol combines lending, borrowing, and risk-managed liquidity instruments with Chainlink oracles to obtain precise collateral valuation. Ethereum is solid at $4,460 with ETF inflows and strong on-chain demand supporting it, but the early-stage position in MUTM has much greater upside.

The South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that city authorities say the residents all failed to pay their local taxes. The city also announced that it has opened a trading account on an unnamed domestic crypto exchange , becoming one of the first government bodies to do so. Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province, South Korea. (Source: Minseong Kim [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Seized Crypto: We Will Sell Coins Directly, Says City Cheongju’s move follows a recent ruling from the regulatory Financial Services Commission (FSC). The FSC is gradually opening the door to corporate crypto investment, beginning by allowing government organs and charitable organizations to buy and sell coins. The city says that if residents fail to pay their outstanding tax bills, it will use its powers to oblige crypto exchanges to hand over data pertaining to these residents’ crypto wallets . Local tax bodies have the power to freeze coins belonging to tax evaders. But the new wallet will let tax officials forcibly transfer crypto to the city’s wallet. From there, city officials said, it will be “sold directly.” The city will then transfer the fiat to its treasury. The city says that its latest crackdown on tax evaders has seen tax officials seize coins from 161 individuals who collectively owe the city around 1.5 billion won ($1.1 million).

But the success of the crackdowns was “limited due to Cheongju’s lack of a means to convert them into cash,” Yonhap wrote. The city said it will advise tax evaders to sell their cryptoassets so they can pay their outstanding bills. But, if necessary, the city said, it will “take steps to liquidate the funds.” A Cheongju city official said: “We will do our utmost to collect the money owed to the city. We will ensure that the crypto sector no longer provides a tax haven for delinquents.” Last month, the district of Gangnam, in Seoul, announced it was stepping up its own crypto confiscation program for tax evaders. The district, which is home to most of the country’s biggest crypto companies, has seized 340 million won ($244,480) since the end of last year .

These reports, circulating through local media, painted a picture of halted activities and unpaid bills. However, Tether has swiftly moved to refute these claims, assuring the community that its significant investment in the country remains firmly on track. What Were the Sensational Claims Against Tether Crypto Mining in Uruguay? The core of the controversy stemmed from a report by Uruguayan news outlet Telemundo. They alleged that UTE, Uruguay’s state-owned power company, had cut off electricity to Tether’s mining facility. The reason cited was an outstanding $2 million bill for May. Furthermore, the report suggested that this power cut would force Tether to abandon its entire mining business and future expansion plans in the region. Telemundo also mentioned a separate $2.8 million debt linked to another local project, adding to the narrative of financial distress for the Tether crypto mining venture. These allegations quickly gained traction, raising questions about the stability of large-scale crypto investments in Latin America. The reports created a ripple of concern among investors and industry observers, prompting Tether to issue an immediate and clear response. How Did Tether Respond to These Reports About Its Crypto Mining Operations? Tether did not hesitate to address the speculation head-on. The company categorically dismissed the claims as “speculative reporting.” Their official statement clarified that the situation was not a cut-off due to non-payment, but rather a matter of ongoing discussions. Tether emphasized that it is actively engaged with the Uruguayan government to resolve any outstanding issues. This proactive denial aims to quell any concerns about the stability and future of its Tether crypto mining efforts in the nation, reassuring investors and stakeholders. It highlights the company’s commitment to transparent communication, especially when facing potentially damaging rumors. Why is Uruguay a Key Location for Tether Crypto Mining? Tether launched its ambitious mining operations in Uruguay in November 2023, backed by a substantial $500 million investment. The choice of Uruguay was strategic, likely due to its favorable energy policies and significant reliance on renewable energy sources. Such large-scale investments in Tether crypto mining highlight the company’s commitment to diversifying its portfolio and securing sustainable energy for its operations. This move also signifies Uruguay’s growing appeal as a hub for energy-intensive industries like cryptocurrency mining, driven by its stable political and economic environment. The country’s infrastructure and regulatory landscape offer a promising foundation for long-term projects, making it an attractive destination for major crypto players. What’s Next for Tether’s Crypto Mining Endeavor in Uruguay? Despite the recent media storm, Tether’s commitment to its Uruguayan venture appears steadfast. The company’s focus remains on constructive dialogue with local authorities to ensure a smooth operational environment. This incident underscores the challenges and scrutiny that large-scale cryptocurrency operations often face, especially concerning infrastructure and local regulations. The resolution of these discussions will be crucial in shaping the perception and future trajectory of Tether crypto mining , not just in Uruguay but potentially across other regions considering similar investments. It reinforces the need for clear communication channels between companies, governments, and the public to avoid misinformation. In conclusion, Tether has strongly denied reports of halting its significant $500 million Tether crypto mining operation in Uruguay. While local media fueled speculation about power cuts and unpaid bills, Tether clarified that it is engaged in active discussions with the Uruguayan government to resolve any issues. This situation highlights the importance of accurate reporting and direct communication in the fast-paced crypto world. Tether’s commitment to its investment and operations in Uruguay remains clear, underscoring its long-term vision for sustainable crypto mining.

The company has successfully secured a CleanSpark credit line worth $100 million from Coinbase Prime, utilizing its own Bitcoin holdings as collateral. This strategic maneuver highlights a growing trend in the digital asset space, offering a robust solution for companies seeking flexible financing without diluting their equity. What Does This CleanSpark Credit Line Deal Entail? The core of this financial arrangement involves CleanSpark leveraging its existing Bitcoin assets to obtain a substantial credit facility. Coinbase Prime, a leading institutional platform, provided the $100 million credit line. This type of financing allows CleanSpark to access capital for its operational needs and expansion plans while retaining ownership of its valuable Bitcoin. Non-Dilutive Financing: Unlike issuing new shares, this credit line does not dilute existing shareholder value. Asset Leverage: CleanSpark effectively puts its Bitcoin holdings to work, generating capital without selling them. Operational Flexibility: The funds can support various initiatives, from purchasing new mining equipment to covering day-to-day expenses. Such deals are becoming increasingly popular as the crypto market matures. Companies with significant digital asset holdings are exploring innovative ways to utilize these assets beyond simple HODLing. Why Use Bitcoin as Collateral? Unpacking the Benefits Utilizing Bitcoin as collateral offers several compelling advantages, particularly for a company deeply embedded in the crypto ecosystem like CleanSpark. Firstly, it demonstrates confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. By holding onto their BTC, companies like CleanSpark signal their belief in its future appreciation, even as they secure immediate capital. Moreover, Bitcoin-backed loans provide a relatively quick and efficient way to access liquidity. Traditional financing can often be slow and bureaucratic, whereas crypto-backed options, especially through platforms like Coinbase Prime, streamline the process. This speed is crucial in the fast-paced world of Bitcoin mining, where opportunities for expansion can arise rapidly. The ability to secure a CleanSpark credit line without selling off valuable Bitcoin holdings is a game-changer. It means CleanSpark can continue to benefit from any potential price increases in Bitcoin while still funding its growth. This dual benefit makes such financing highly attractive. Are There Risks to a Bitcoin-Backed Credit Line? While the benefits are clear, it is important to acknowledge the inherent risks associated with using a volatile asset like Bitcoin as collateral. The primary concern is market volatility. If the price of Bitcoin drops significantly, the value of the collateral could fall below a certain threshold, potentially triggering a margin call or liquidation event. CleanSpark, however, is likely to have robust risk management strategies in place. These might include: Maintaining a conservative loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Holding additional unencumbered Bitcoin or other assets as a buffer. Actively monitoring market conditions and having a plan for potential price dips. Understanding these risks is vital for any company considering similar financing. Responsible management ensures that the benefits outweigh the potential downsides. The Bigger Picture: What This Means for Bitcoin Miners The successful securing of this CleanSpark credit line sends a strong signal to the broader market. It indicates increasing institutional comfort and sophistication in dealing with Bitcoin and other digital assets. For Bitcoin miners specifically, it opens up new avenues for growth and stability. Access to flexible capital is paramount for miners, who often face high operational costs related to energy and equipment. This type of financing allows them to scale operations, upgrade their infrastructure, and remain competitive without being forced to sell their mined Bitcoin during unfavorable market conditions. It underscores a shift towards more mature financial strategies within the crypto industry. A Strategic Leap for CleanSpark’s Future CleanSpark’s $100 million CleanSpark credit line is more than just a financial transaction; it represents a strategic leap forward. By intelligently leveraging its Bitcoin holdings, the company has secured vital capital for expansion and operational flexibility. This move not only strengthens CleanSpark’s position in the competitive Bitcoin mining landscape but also sets a precedent for how other crypto-native businesses can harness their digital assets for sustainable growth. It reflects a maturing industry where innovative financial solutions are becoming key to long-term success. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Bitcoin-backed credit line? A1: A Bitcoin-backed credit line allows a borrower to use their Bitcoin holdings as collateral to secure a loan or line of credit, similar to how traditional assets like real estate or stocks are used. Q2: Who provided CleanSpark with this credit line? A2: Coinbase Prime, Coinbase’s institutional platform, provided the $100 million credit line to CleanSpark. Q3: What are the main benefits for CleanSpark from this deal? A3: The primary benefits include accessing $100 million in capital without diluting equity, leveraging existing Bitcoin assets, and gaining operational flexibility for expansion and general corporate purposes. Q4: What are the risks of using Bitcoin as collateral? A4: The main risk is Bitcoin’s price volatility. A significant drop in Bitcoin’s value could lead to margin calls or liquidation of the collateral if the loan-to-value ratio is breached. Q5: How does this deal impact the broader Bitcoin mining industry? A5: It signals increasing institutional confidence in Bitcoin and provides a new model for miners to access capital for growth and operational needs without selling their mined Bitcoin, fostering greater financial stability in the sector.

Ethereum is still dominating discussions, especially with its importance to DeFi and NFTs, but analysts are starting to suggest the most explosive gains in 2025 are likely not from ETH. One ‘hidden coin’ getting a lot of attention for its security, scarcity and cultural relevance is MAGACOIN FINANCE . According to top predictions, this altcoin is set for 800% gains in the near future. Ethereum’s Market Context Ethereum has long been regarded as the standard for smart contract platforms. Thousands of decentralized applications run on it, with billions of dollars’ worth of total value locked, and it is the platform of choice for developers building on Web3. The sector’s undisputed leader, but faced with scaling hurdles, regulatory questions, and Layer-2 competition, growth rates are slowing down the ecosystem. As Ethereum is part of almost every crypto portfolio, it is normally not capable of achieving 10x or higher returns, given its market cap size. Investors looking for exponential growth are now focusing on low-cap tokens as they can grow faster from a low base. Here’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE comes into play as a favorite amongst analysts. Analyst Make Case for Fast Rising Altcoin MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly established itself as a hidden gem by granting the kind of fundamentals the investors now require after years of speculative projects. Its unique ecosystem and double audited smart contracts means investors can trust that the token is genuine and has long-term viability. Furthermore MAGACOIN FINANCE is unique in its ownership structure. MAGACOIN FINANCE is not controlled by a VC, unlike other projects that are VC-dominated. This puts the community at the heart of the development process, leading to a more organic growth path. According to analysts, the model reflects the initial days of Ethereum and Bitcoin and MAGACOIN FINANCE is set for a similar trajectory. Why Analysts Are Forecasting 800% Gains The projection of 800% gains is not pulled from thin air. The models referenced incorporate liquidity, limited volume supply and rotation of capital during altcoin cycles. If Ethereum grows steadily by 50–100% in 2025, analysts say that MAGACOIN FINANCE could yield multiples much higher, as it is a smaller but structurally strong project. The project’s upcoming exchange listings would act as the expected catalyst to boost liquidity and access drastically. When tokens get priced in on a centralised exchange, quick repricing happens as new capital flows in. MAGACOIN FINANCE has a strong community and solid fundamentals to convert buzz into actual adoption. Conclusion The crypto market is heating up, and Ethereum remains a pillar of the ecosystem. Yet the search for exponential returns is pushing analysts and investors to look beyond established giants. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as the hidden coin tipped to outperform Ethereum in 2025, with projections pointing to 800% gains . With exchange listings on the horizon, rising investor buzz, and fundamentals that blend scarcity with security, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out its space in the altcoin conversation. Ethereum may continue to provide stability, but for those seeking transformative upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the coin to watch.

A recent and particularly disheartening incident from South Korea highlights the severe risks involved, especially concerning the growing threat of a cryptocurrency scam .

This tragic event serves as a stark reminder for everyone, from individuals to institutions, about the importance of vigilance in the digital asset space. What Exactly Happened: A Tragic Cryptocurrency Scam Unfolds According to reports from Financial News, the administrator at a Catholic church was entrusted with 480 million won (about $348,000 USD) collected from church members. These funds were specifically earmarked for purchasing land and funding construction projects essential for the parish’s growth. However, instead of fulfilling this sacred trust, the administrator reportedly diverted these funds into cryptocurrency investments. The situation took a devastating turn when the entire amount was lost to a sophisticated fraudulent investment scheme, effectively a cryptocurrency scam . The Betrayal of Trust: Funds intended for community development were redirected. The Lure of Quick Gains: The administrator was allegedly drawn into a deceptive crypto investment. The Ultimate Loss: All $348,000 vanished, leaving the church and its members in despair. Understanding the Mechanics of a Cryptocurrency Scam: How Do They Work? The unfortunate incident in Mokpo is not isolated. Cryptocurrency scams are a pervasive and evolving threat in the digital economy. These schemes often prey on individuals’ desire for high returns, leveraging the complexity and novelty of the crypto market. Scammers employ various tactics, from fake investment platforms and phishing attacks to elaborate Ponzi schemes disguised as legitimate crypto projects. They typically promise unrealistic profits, often through aggressive marketing and pressure tactics. Victims are encouraged to invest quickly, without sufficient due diligence, only to find their funds disappear or become inaccessible. This particular case involved a “fraudulent investment scheme,” suggesting a well-orchestrated deception designed to steal assets under the guise of investment. Protecting Your Investments: Essential Steps Against Cryptocurrency Scams Given the increasing sophistication of these threats, safeguarding your assets against a cryptocurrency scam is more crucial than ever. Both individuals and organizations must adopt robust preventative measures. Education is your first line of defense. Understanding common scam tactics can help you identify red flags before it’s too late. Verify Legitimacy: Always research any investment platform or project thoroughly. Check official websites, whitepapers, and reputable news sources. Be Wary of Unrealistic Promises: If an investment promises guaranteed high returns with little to no risk, it’s almost certainly a scam. Secure Your Accounts: Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets. Consult Experts: Before making significant investments, seek advice from trusted financial advisors who understand the crypto market. Report Suspicious Activity: If you encounter a suspected scam, report it to the relevant authorities and inform your community. The Broader Impact: Rebuilding Trust After a Cryptocurrency Scam The fallout from a cryptocurrency scam extends far beyond financial loss. For the Catholic church in Mokpo, this incident undoubtedly erodes trust within the community and casts a shadow over the administration. Such events highlight the need for greater financial literacy and stringent oversight, especially when managing communal funds. Institutions handling public or donated funds have an ethical and legal obligation to ensure their security. Implementing clear financial protocols, conducting regular audits, and providing training on digital asset risks are vital steps. This unfortunate event serves as a powerful cautionary tale, urging all custodians of funds to exercise extreme caution and diligence in the volatile world of cryptocurrency investments. Summary: Learning from a Devastating Loss The case of the South Korean church administrator is a poignant reminder of the devastating consequences that a cryptocurrency scam can inflict. It underscores the critical need for vigilance, education, and robust security measures in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. While cryptocurrencies offer innovative financial possibilities, they also come with significant risks, especially from malicious actors. Let this incident be a call to action for greater awareness and proactive protection of our hard-earned assets and sacred trusts. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a cryptocurrency scam?

Q2: How can I identify a potential cryptocurrency scam? A: Look for red flags such as guaranteed high returns, pressure to invest quickly, anonymous teams, vague whitepapers, requests for private keys, or unsolicited investment offers from unknown sources. Q3: What should I do if I suspect I’ve fallen victim to a crypto scam? A: Immediately cease all communication with the scammers, gather all evidence (transaction IDs, communication logs), report the incident to local law enforcement and relevant financial regulatory bodies, and consider seeking legal advice. Q4: Are all cryptocurrency investments risky? A: All investments carry some level of risk, and cryptocurrencies are known for their high volatility. However, legitimate crypto projects differ significantly from outright scams. It’s essential to distinguish between market risk and fraudulent activity through thorough research and due diligence.

In a video analysis published today, analyst CryptoInsightUK urged restraint and argued that the move looks like a leverage flush rather than a structural break, pointing to liquidity maps, momentum gauges, and market-cap composites that, in his view, still skew constructive once the dust settles. Do not rush and panic this morning,” he said at the outset. “The only rush and panic thing that you should be doing at this time is if you just want to buy spot… nothing has really changed at all.” He framed the sell-off against near-all-time-high closes last week across market-cap aggregates: Total2 (ex-BTC) “closed at about $1.66–$1.67 trillion,” Total3 (ex-BTC, ex-ETH) at “$1.13 trillion,” and total crypto market cap just shy of $4 trillion at “$3.96.” The message, he said, is to “zoom out,” assess structure, and watch for a familiar bottoming sequence that often follows abrupt long liquidations. Related Reading: Crypto Leverage Whipeout: $600M+ In BTC & ETH Longs Liquidated The analyst’s short-term roadmap hinges on a classic liquidity sweep plus momentum divergence. After a vertical wick clears resting bids and tripping stops, he looks for price to “chop,” revisit—and marginally undercut—the intraday low, while the RSI sets a higher low. “What we’re looking for structurally… is a higher low on the RSI, perfect if it’s in the oversold area… when we have a higher low on the RSI and a lower low in price action… the momentum of the selling is waning,” he said, calling this setup a reliable reversal tell “the higher the timeframe, the better.” Crypto Watch: ETH, XRP, DOGE, ADA He cited fresh examples across majors. For ETH, a drawdown from “about $4,400 down to $4,000” knifed through a “dense” cluster of below-price liquidity that had accumulated for weeks. “This is the first time we’ve seen more liquidity above us than we have below since” the prior five-wave advance, he argued, consistent with an ABC correction that may be maturing. XRP, he said, “pinpointed” its only notable pocket of sub-price liquidity, wicking to $2.66, a level he mapped against $2.8–$2.69. He now sees the “main liquidity… above us for XRP at $3.40, while allowing that a brief wick-fill toward today’s low could complete the divergence pattern he’s watching. Bitcoin’s dominance spike during the flush also fits his playbook. He described the dominance RSI as “massively overbought… probably like on the hourly as overbought as I’ve seen it,” noting that prior forays into this zone have coincided with local peaks in BTC relative strength before rotation back into large caps and selective alts. That context—together with his “zoomed-out” view—underpins his claim that “bullish sentiment gets rewarded over time,” even if the path includes unnerving resets. Dogecoin, he cautioned, can still probe the $0.19–$0.20 zone after reclaiming the $0.22 support region, but he flagged that the 4-hour RSI is as depressed as at prior cyclical lows. He disclosed a “2x” DOGE long around $0.225, acknowledging no hard stop given his conviction in the higher-timeframe trend and accepting the risk of further chop. Related Reading: The Fed Just Changed Everything For Crypto, Says Top Trader Cardano “wicked into” a mapped liquidity shelf near $0.77, with “main liquidity… up at $1.00 and $1.20” on the daily, a configuration he views as asymmetrically favorable once the market stabilizes. What To Watch Now Throughout, he emphasized that today’s damage was amplified by leverage, not fundamentals. “We’ve had a liquidity flush,” he said, referencing a social post he saw that “a billion dollars of leverage got flushed out in 30 minutes.” For him, that is “positive; we want to see this leverage reset.” He cautioned that near-term direction is hostage to US cash-market flows—“The US might wake up and… sell, or… buy the [dip]”—but insisted the larger structures are intact: “Weekly… we’re still sitting at all-time highs… Whether the top’s in or not, I don’t think so. I really, really, really, really, really don’t think so.” His near-term checklist is straightforward: let volatility run its course, look for the RSI higher-low against a marginal price lower-low, and respect predefined support/target zones. “Take your emotion away and look for structures that you know are bottoming structures,” he said. The trader psychology, in his telling, is as critical as the levels. “These things happen and it feels like a culmination of sentiment… anger, frustration, and now probably despair… If it’s too much… go for a run,” he advised, adding that “the market doesn’t care” about anyone’s mood and will “do what it’s going to do anyway.” If the “real storm” is still to come, he implies it’s the post-flush move that matters—whether a final liquidity sweep completes the divergence or a swift rotation lifts majors into the overhead liquidity he’s mapped. Either way, he argues, the decisive phase is ahead, not behind: “Let’s see how things play out… It’s not a time to panic… If you want to be buying things… when we’re oversold like this, it’s a decent time to buy,” he said. At press time, ETH traded at $4,185.

Bitcoin Has Erased Its Recent Recovery With A Drop Under $113,000 Last week, things looked to be on the up for Bitcoin as its price approached the $118,000 level, but the end of the week brought a setback for the coin. The new week appears to have only accelerated the decline, as the cryptocurrency has opened Monday with a sharp plummet to the low $112,000 levels. The below chart shows how Bitcoin’s recent performance has looked. The bearish momentum hasn’t been limited to Bitcoin. Ethereum (ETH) and the altcoins have also plummeted during the past day, with most of them observing larger losses than BTC. Among the top coins, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Chainlink (LINK) have suffered the largest drops at 10.5% and 9%, respectively. Like is usually the case, the market-wide volatility has meant that chaos has ensued over on the derivatives exchanges . Crypto Market Liquidations Have Neared $1.7 Billion According to data from CoinGlass , the cryptocurrency derivatives market has witnessed an extraordinary amount of liquidations during the past day. “ Liquidation ” here refers to the forceful closure that any open contract undergoes after it has amassed losses of a certain degree (as set by the platform). Since the price action has been majorly to the downside during the past day, the positions incurring losses would be the bullish bets . And indeed, as the below table shows, the latest liquidations have been extremely lopsided toward long contracts. In total, the cryptocurrency market has seen a flush of $1.67 billion inside this window, out of which $1.59 billion of the liquidations involved long positions. Only about 5% of the liquidations ($83 million) affected shorts. In terms of the individual symbols, Ethereum seems to have contributed the most to the squeeze with $496 million in liquidations. Bitcoin generally tops this chart, but the asset has seen a flush of just $285 million, more than $200 million less than ETH’s figure. The latter’s dominance may be a result of its sharper price decline of 7%, as well as the fact that the cryptocurrency has been getting more speculative attention lately. Solana (SOL) has been the third largest asset in terms of the metric, with a figure of about $95 million. XRP (XRP), which has a larger market cap than SOL, is behind at $78 million. Dogecoin rounds out the top five with liquidations of $61 million. Mass liquidation events aren’t exactly a rare sight in the cryptocurrency sector, owing to the fact that coins can be volatile, and leverage can be easily accessible. Even for the standards of the market, however, this latest squeeze has been an outlier in its scale.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin liquidations|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto liquidations|Cryptocurrency,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-23 00:00:34

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Korean Air has signed a research agreement with Stockholm-based Wingbits to supply real-time ADS-B data for the airline’s ACROSS air traffic coordination system. The deal gives the carrier’s R&D division access to coverage across Korea’s Incheon FIR, North America and Europe as it tests how drones, cargo aircraft and eventually eVTOL taxis will share crowded skies. Wingbits runs a decentralized network of cryptographically secured ADS-B (real-time data for flight information) receivers, rewarding contributors in tokens for placing hardware in optimal locations. The DePIN startup previously closed a $5.6 million round in January , led by Bullish Capital. Bullish is the parent company of CoinDesk. “All of aviation relies on this data to some extent, and it’s a really big and profitable market,” co-founder Robin Wingårdh told CoinDesk in an interview during Korea Blockchain Week. “It was just kind of weird that all these people do it for free, while three out of four networks were acquired for hundreds of millions and nothing went back to the community.” Incentives, Wingårdh said, are what separate Wingbits from rivals. “If you properly incentivize, you actually get people to put receivers where they matter, on a roof, at a business, or even renting space in a high-demand area,"" he continued. ""And on average, we see more than twice the coverage per antenna versus the competition, simply because the incentive is there.” For Korean Air, the collaboration is as much about the future as the present. Its R&D division is experimenting with advanced air mobility, and Wingårdh said the demand for low-latency, secure data will only grow. “Our view on the advanced air mobility segment is really it’s coming, flying taxis, flying cargo, and you’re going to have a lot more objects in the sky,"" he said. ""We don’t believe that there’s currently any infrastructure that can actually function as proper tracking infrastructure for that combination of aviation, advanced mobility, and drones."" The Korean Air partnership marks Wingbits’ first airline collaboration and signals that legacy carriers see value in decentralized infrastructure. For Wingbits, it’s a test case in moving from crypto-native hype to mainstream aviation, with the long-term bet that blockchain-backed data networks can underpin the next era of urban air mobility. Market Movements BTC : Bitcoin is trading at $112,730. Despite back-to-back ETF inflows totaling over $385M on September 18–19, Bitcoin’s price has struggled to gain momentum, reflecting broader profit-taking and cautious market sentiment. ETH: Ethereum is trading near $4,200 and has fallen more sharply than Bitcoin in the short term, even as spot ETH ETFs attracted over $260M in net inflows across September 18–19. The pullback highlights how ETH remains more sensitive to shifts in risk sentiment and waning speculative demand, though its long-term fundamentals tied to DeFi, staking, and institutional adoption remain intact. Gold: Gold continues to trade record highs, supported by expectations of further rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve, central bank demand, inflation concerns, and geopolitical risk. S&P 500: U.S. stock futures were flat Monday night, with Dow and S&P 500 contracts each slipping 0.04% as investors eyed risks at record highs.

The addition of Centrifuge (CFG) and TROLL (TROLL) signals new avenues for investors and a potential shift in market dynamics. This development is crucial for anyone following digital asset trends and looking for fresh opportunities. What Does the Latest Coinbase Listing Mean for You? A Coinbase listing is often a significant event in the crypto market. It typically brings increased visibility, liquidity, and perceived legitimacy to the listed assets. For many projects, being added to Coinbase’s roadmap is a stamp of approval that can lead to broader adoption and price appreciation. Increased Accessibility: More investors can easily buy, sell, and trade these tokens. Enhanced Liquidity: Higher trading volumes generally lead to better price discovery. Market Validation: A Coinbase listing often implies a project has met stringent security and compliance standards. This strategic move by Coinbase underscores its commitment to expanding its diverse offering of digital assets, providing users with more investment choices. Deep Dive into CFG: Centrifuge and Real-World Assets Centrifuge (CFG) is a decentralized asset financing protocol that aims to bridge the gap between decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world assets (RWAs). It allows businesses to tokenize assets like invoices, real estate, and supply chain payments, bringing them onto the blockchain. Tokenizing Illiquid Assets: CFG enables the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing real-world assets. Access to Liquidity: These tokenized assets can then be used as collateral to access liquidity pools on DeFi platforms. Empowering Small Businesses: Centrifuge provides a new way for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to get financing without traditional intermediaries. The inclusion of CFG in the Coinbase listing roadmap highlights a growing trend towards integrating traditional finance with blockchain technology, opening up new possibilities for institutional and retail investors alike. Understanding TROLL: A Community-Driven Phenomenon TROLL, often categorized as a meme coin, represents a different facet of the crypto landscape. These tokens are typically driven by strong community engagement and viral social media trends rather than fundamental utility or complex technology. Community Power: TROLL’s value is heavily influenced by its online community and collective sentiment. Volatile Nature: Meme coins are known for their rapid price fluctuations, presenting both high reward and high risk. Cultural Significance: They often tap into internet culture, creating a unique appeal among certain demographics. While the exact utility of TROLL might be less defined compared to CFG, its addition to the Coinbase listing roadmap reflects the exchange’s recognition of the diverse interests within the crypto community. Investors should approach such assets with caution and a clear understanding of their speculative nature. Navigating New Opportunities: What Should Investors Consider? The expansion of the Coinbase listing roadmap with CFG and TROLL presents both exciting opportunities and potential challenges. Before diving in, it’s crucial for investors to conduct thorough due diligence. Research Both Projects: Understand the technology, team, and community behind CFG and TROLL. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: CFG deals with real-world assets, while TROLL is a meme coin; their risk profiles differ significantly. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid over-allocating to any single asset, especially speculative ones. Stay Informed: Keep up with news and market sentiment surrounding these tokens. This move by Coinbase offers its users a broader spectrum of investment options, from innovative DeFi protocols to popular community-driven tokens. Coinbase’s decision to add CFG and TROLL to its listing roadmap is a testament to the ever-evolving and dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. Whether you’re interested in the tangible utility of real-world asset tokenization or the vibrant energy of community-driven tokens, these additions expand the horizons for all crypto enthusiasts. As always, informed decisions are key to navigating this exciting landscape successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does it mean for a cryptocurrency to be on Coinbase’s listing roadmap?

When this index dips, it often signals a significant shift in investor sentiment, moving from optimism towards caution. Currently, the market finds itself firmly planted in the ‘fear’ zone, prompting many to wonder what lies ahead for their investments. What Does the Current Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reading Tell Us? According to data from provider Alternative, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index recently slipped two points, landing at 43. This value keeps us squarely in the ‘fear’ category, a state where investors tend to be more hesitant and risk-averse. For context, an index value of zero represents ‘extreme fear,’ while 100 signifies ‘extreme greed.’ This numerical barometer helps us gauge the overall mood of the market, offering a glimpse into the collective psyche of crypto investors. A reading of 43 suggests that while extreme panic might not be widespread, a significant portion of the market is feeling cautious, possibly due to recent price movements or broader economic concerns. It’s a signal that the market’s confidence is wavering. Unpacking the Components: How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? It’s not just a random figure. This index is a sophisticated blend of several key market indicators, each contributing to its final score. Understanding these components helps demystify how this crucial sentiment gauge is formed and why its movements matter so much to your investment decisions. The index is a carefully weighted average of six distinct factors: Market Volatility (25%) : This measures how much Bitcoin’s price fluctuates. High volatility often indicates a nervous market, pushing the index towards fear. Trading Volume (25%) : Strong buying volume usually correlates with greed, while low volume can signal fear or indifference. Social Media Mentions (15%) : Analyzing keywords and sentiment across various social platforms provides a real-time snapshot of public perception. A surge in negative sentiment can drive the index down. Surveys (15%) : While currently paused, these polls directly ask investors about their market outlook, offering direct insights into sentiment. Bitcoin’s Market Dominance (10%) : An increasing dominance often points to investors seeking safer havens in Bitcoin, suggesting fear in the altcoin market. Conversely, decreasing dominance can signal greed for altcoin opportunities. Google Search Volume (10%) : Tracking searches for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘Bitcoin crash’ can reveal underlying anxieties, contributing to the fear score. Navigating the ‘Fear Zone’: Actionable Insights for Investors When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is Low When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index resides in the fear zone, it often presents a dual-edged sword for investors. On one hand, widespread fear can lead to panic selling, driving prices lower and creating potential opportunities for those with a long-term perspective. As the old adage goes, ""Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful."" However, it also signals a period of heightened uncertainty and potential downside risk. It’s a time for careful consideration, not impulsive reactions. Here are some actionable insights to consider when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is low: Stay Informed : Don’t let emotion dictate your moves. Understand the underlying reasons for the market’s fear, whether it’s macroeconomic news, regulatory changes, or specific project developments. Re-evaluate Your Portfolio : This might be a good time to assess your risk tolerance and ensure your investments align with your financial goals. Consider if your asset allocation is still appropriate for current market conditions. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) : Consider consistently investing a fixed amount over time, regardless of market fluctuations. This strategy can mitigate risk during volatile periods and average out your purchase price. Avoid Impulse Decisions : Panic selling can lock in losses. Instead, take a step back, conduct thorough research, and make informed choices based on your investment strategy. Beyond the Number: Why Market Sentiment, as Reflected by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, Truly Matters Market sentiment, as reflected by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , plays a significant role in price movements. When fear grips the market, investors often sell off assets, leading to price declines. Conversely, excessive greed can inflate asset prices beyond their intrinsic value, potentially setting the stage for corrections. Understanding this psychological aspect of the market is crucial for any investor. It’s important to remember that the index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct buy or sell signal. It provides a valuable context for market conditions, helping you understand the prevailing emotional state. Savvy investors use this information to inform their broader strategy, rather than blindly following its every dip or surge. It’s a tool for better decision-making, not a crystal ball. The recent dip in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 43 serves as a timely reminder of the ever-present emotional swings in the crypto market. While fear can feel unsettling, it also offers a chance for rational evaluation and strategic planning. By understanding how the index works and what its current reading signifies, investors can navigate these turbulent waters with greater confidence and make decisions that align with their long-term objectives. Stay informed, stay calm, and make calculated moves. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the prevailing emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It ranges from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed), helping investors gauge market sentiment. What does a low score (like 43) on the index mean? A low score, such as 43, indicates that the market is in a ‘fear’ zone. This means investors are generally cautious, hesitant, and may be selling assets, which can lead to lower prices. How should investors react to the index being in the ‘fear’ zone? In the ‘fear’ zone, investors are advised to stay informed, re-evaluate their portfolios, consider dollar-cost averaging, and avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on emotion. It can present opportunities for long-term investors. Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a buy/sell signal? No, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not a direct buy or sell signal. It is a sentiment indicator that provides context about the market’s emotional state. Investors should use it as one tool among many to inform their broader investment strategy. What factors influence the index’s score? The index is calculated based on market volatility, trading volume, social media mentions, surveys (when active), Bitcoin’s market dominance, and Google search volume.

The nation’s ruling Democratic Party has officially launched a dedicated Digital Asset Task Force. This pivotal group aims to accelerate the development of comprehensive stablecoin legislation , signaling a significant move in regulating the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency market. Why South Korea is Prioritizing Stablecoin Legislation? South Korea consistently leads in technological adoption. As digital assets, particularly stablecoins, gain global traction, robust regulatory frameworks become paramount. Stablecoins, pegged to traditional assets for stability, play a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem.

Each type presents unique characteristics, risk profiles, and operational considerations. Regulatory Complexity: Crafting comprehensive yet flexible laws to adapt to rapid technological advancements is a substantial hurdle. Systemic Risks: Addressing potential systemic risks stablecoins might pose to traditional financial markets requires careful and proactive consideration. International Cooperation: Cross-border collaboration is essential to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure a globally harmonized approach to stablecoin legislation . The DATF will need to expertly navigate these multifaceted complexities.

He acknowledged that he championed last week’s 25-bps rate cut to take out insurance against a weakening labor market. The American economist maintained that interest rates are currently between modestly restrictive and neutral. He revealed that he would support further rate cuts if the labor market continues to worsen. Musalem also believes that it’s important to keep long-term interest rates stable. Musalem expects more cuts if the labor market worsens During the boom, many used a simple strategy: borrowing money at one interest rate and re-lending at a higher rate. But when rates exploded, the trade broke. This can become economically contagious across the entire housing market. #CanadianRealEstate #CarryTrade pic.twitter.com/6T6k1Sdidh — Daniel Foch (@daniel_foch) September 22, 2025 The banker stated that he supported the FOMC’s quarter-point rate cut last week as a precautionary move intended to support the labor market at full employment and against further weakening. He added that the little room left for further easing will ensure policy won’t become overly accommodative. The president of St. Louis Bank argued that recent economic data shows that the adverse risk to employment was surging. He added that he still expects risk inflation to remain above the central bank’s 2% target. According to Fed’s Musalem, booming stock markets and low credit spreads continue to support the economy. He urged policymakers to tread carefully because rates are close to neutral after adjusting for inflation, which is a level that neither boosts nor slows growth. “Should further signs of labor market weakness emerge, I would support additional reductions in the policy rate, provided the risk of above-target inflation persistence has not increased and long-term inflation expectations remain anchored.” -Alberto Musalem, President at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The economist noted that the impact of tariffs on prices has so far been less than expected. He also warned that other factors seem to be contributing to above-target inflation. Musalem believes that monetary policy is continuing to lean against persistence in above-target inflation, regardless of whether it gains from the impact of levies, lower supply growth, or other reasons. The St. Louis bank president also maintained that he expects the effects of tariffs on prices to fade in the next two to three quarters. He also urged policymakers to stay on guard against second-round effects and the threat of persistent inflation. The banker added that he was approaching policy moves on a meeting-by-meeting basis as he votes on rate decisions this year. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic also mentioned that he was comfortable with last week’s rate cut but sees little need for further cuts this year. The banker revealed that he expected only one rate cut in 2025 in his economic projections, which were in line with what he predicted in June. Bostic said he’s concerned about inflation, which has remained high for a long time. The banker will not be voting on policy until 2027, but highlighted that he would not be moving or in favor of it. The FOMC indicated in its closely watched dot plot that one official wanted no cuts this year, including last week’s. According to the data, eight policymakers were content with just one more cut this year. The FOMC also revealed that a few officials expect two more cuts, suggesting one cut each at the two remaining meetings this year. Rate cuts cause a decline in bond prices After the Fed cut rates last Wednesday, longer-term Treasury yields surged last week, a sign that bond investors didn’t get the assurances they sought. The rate cut also saw investors sending stocks to record highs as they championed the first rate cut of the year. Chief investment officer at One Point BFG Wealth Partners, Peter Boockvar, noted a selloff in the bond market. He acknowledged that long-term bond traders didn’t want the Fed to cut interest rates. He also explained that prices and yields for bonds move in an inverse direction; that’s why long-term bond sales drove down the price and drove up the yield.

This will boost ties between the partners when U.S. President Donald Trump’s protectionist policies reshape global commerce. EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic confirmed that the agreement, finalized after nearly a decade of negotiations, will save European exporters about €600 million ($700 million) in tariffs annually. It also removes restrictions on transactions involving key raw materials. “We are really opening a new chapter of huge, huge proportions,” Sefcovic told Bloomberg News , stressing that Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, bigger than Vietnam, the Philippines, and Thailand combined, has long been trading below its potential with the EU. Tariff cuts set to boost cars, machinery, and agriculture The deal reduces tariffs to zero on 96% of goods within five years, a move expected to increase EU exports to Indonesia by at least 30%, or around €3 billion. Duties on EU cars will drop from 50% to zero over the same period, while levies on machinery and appliances will fall from 30% to zero more quickly. Agricultural and food products will also benefit from liberalized trade. Licensing and other restrictions will be scrapped for materials such as EU-exported chemicals. Meanwhile, Indonesia’s processed materials will receive preferential tariff treatment in Europe. However, Jakarta’s nickel export ban, a flashpoint in a World Trade Organization dispute with the EU, will remain intact. With a population of 300 million, Indonesia is a crucial partner for the EU’s supply-chain diversification strategy as it navigates U.S. tariffs of up to 15% on most exports. The deal followed intensified EU talks with major economies, including India, and completed negotiations with Mercosur, which included Brazil and Argentina. Still, the pact doesn’t resolve frictions over the EU’s deforestation rules, which Jakarta has fiercely opposed due to their impact on palm oil and coffee exports. Instead, Sefcovic said the agreement will provide a platform to help Indonesian companies, especially small exporters, meet EU requirements. The deal must still be ratified by EU member states, the European Parliament, and Indonesia’s legislature before it can take effect. Calling it a “very clear framework,” Sefcovic said the agreement would strengthen trade and create opportunities for both sides. Jakarta and Brussels clash over palm oil, deforestation, and biodiesel duties Meanwhile, frictions over biodiesel remain unresolved. Last month, Indonesia urged the European Union to scrap countervailing duties on biodiesel imports immediately, after the World Trade Organization backed several of Jakarta’s main claims in a complaint to the trade body. The world’s biggest palm oil exporter had contended in its 2023 complaint that the duties levied by the European Union, the third-largest destination for its palm oil products, broke the trade body’s rules. “We urge the EU to revoke these countervailing import duties that are not WTO-compliant immediately,” Trade Minister Budi Santoso said in a statement. The case joins a string of disputes over biodiesel tariffs and palm oil’s link to deforestation. The EU has imposed the duties, ranging from 8% to 18%, since 2019, saying that Southeast Asian nations’ biodiesel producers benefit from grants, tax benefits, and access to raw materials below market prices Indonesia’s economy has been under intense pressure as violent protests, a falling currency, and political tension hammer confidence in what Wall Street considers Southeast Asia’s most stable market. Recently, the Jakarta Composite Index reduced as much as 3.6%, while the rupiah sank to 16,500 per U.S. dollar , its weakest point since August 1, according to data from LSEG. The protests were triggered by frustration over soaring living costs, legislators’ fat paychecks, and recent reports of police violence, creating one of the worst crises the country has faced since President Prabowo Subianto took office last year.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed excitement that the administration is making significant decisions around immigration to acquire the brightest minds in the state. Huang noted: “We represent the American Dream. And so I think immigration is really important to our company and is really important to our nation’s future, and I’m glad to see President Trump making the moves he’s making.” Trump announced plans to increase the H-1B visa fee to $100,000, prompting companies to scramble and reassess their hiring strategies. Under the new rules, employers must provide proof of payment before filing an H-1B petition on behalf of a worker. Additionally, the White House highlighted that applicants will be exposed to several restrictions on their appeal for 12 months until the payment is completed. Huang and Altman express their delight with President Trump’s new decision During an interview, Huang and Altman shared their views on Trump’s recent decision to raise the cost of hiring foreign workers on visas. While commenting on the topic of discussion, they mentioned that Nvidia intends to make a $100 billion investment in OpenAI as the AI lab aims to use Nvidia’s AI processors in constructing data centers worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Following these investment plans, Huang stated that they required all the brightest minds existing to come to the US, urging that immigration is a key aspect of the American Dream. “We embody the American Dream,” he added. Like Nvidia’s CEO, Sam Altman was also pleased with President Trump’s new decision. To support this claim, the CEO shared an optimistic view about these changes, stating that they now need to attract the smartest individuals in the country and simplify this process while offering financial rewards. When comparing the new $100,000 H-1B visa fee to the previous one, the previous one ranged between $2,000 and $5,000 for each application based on how huge a firm was, according to reports from the Immigration Law Group. India and China play a significant role in the US’s visa holders Concerning these changes, analysts have projected that the new $100,000 fee will greatly affect the tech sector and finance industries located in the US. This is because they highly depend on the H-1B program for qualified personnel, especially those from India and China. These two countries contributed 71% and 11.7% of visa holders in 2024, respectively. In the meantime, reports from reliable sources have highlighted that individuals who already possess H-1B visas and are currently in foreign lands will not be required to pay this fee to return. The sources also revealed that many firms prefer to hire H-1B workers to occupy important technical jobs that they feel are hard to locate among American employees. Still, the UK is taking advantage of the situation and may stop charging visa fees for in-demand workers to attract overseas talent and boost its economy. In-demand professionals often apply for the UK’s Global Talent visa, which costs £766 ($1,034) per applicant. Each partner or dependent child must also pay the same fee, meaning the total expense for a family can easily run into several thousand pounds. On top of that, every applicant is required to pay an annual health surcharge of £1,035 to access healthcare services. Introduced in 2020, the Global Talent visa is designed to attract elite workers in fields such as digital technology, engineering, medicine, and science. By contrast, most other foreign employees apply for the Skilled Worker visa, which ranges in cost from £625 to £1,423, depending on the role and salary level. The Prime Minister now believes the time may be right to waive all fees for Global Talent visas. The move comes just days after US President Donald Trump imposed a hefty $100,000 fee for America’s H-1B visas, a change expected to deter elite recruits considering jobs at US tech companies. “Trump’s decision had put wind in the sails of those wanting to reform Britain’s high-end visa system to boost growth ahead of the Nov 26 budget,” the source said.

If so, you’ve probably heard about the buzz surrounding the Altcoin Season Index . This key indicator, which helps gauge the market’s sentiment towards altcoins versus Bitcoin, has recently experienced a notable drop. Understanding this movement is crucial for any investor looking to navigate the volatile world of digital assets. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: What Does 64 Mean? The Altcoin Season Index , provided by CoinMarketCap, is a widely referenced metric that offers insights into market trends. It measures whether we are currently in an ‘altcoin season’ or a ‘Bitcoin season’. The index operates on a simple premise: An altcoin season is considered underway if 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. A reading closer to 100 suggests a strong altcoin season, indicating that a broad range of altcoins are seeing significant gains relative to Bitcoin. Conversely, a lower reading, especially below 50, points towards a ‘Bitcoin season,’ where Bitcoin’s performance is generally superior. Recently, the Altcoin Season Index decreased to 64, a six-point drop from the previous day. While still above the ‘Bitcoin season’ threshold, this decline suggests a weakening momentum for altcoins compared to Bitcoin. It signals that fewer altcoins are currently outperforming Bitcoin, prompting investors to re-evaluate their strategies. Why This Altcoin Season Index Shift is Crucial for Investors A downward movement in the Altcoin Season Index carries significant implications for your investment portfolio. When the index drops, it often means that Bitcoin is beginning to reclaim market dominance or that the capital flowing into altcoins is slowing down. This shift can present both challenges and opportunities: Challenges for Altcoin Holders: If your portfolio is heavily weighted towards altcoins, you might see underperformance compared to Bitcoin. This could lead to a re-evaluation of your holdings. Opportunities for Bitcoin Holders: A stronger Bitcoin season often translates to significant gains for BTC, potentially solidifying its position as the market leader. Market Rebalancing: Investors might consider rebalancing their portfolios, perhaps by taking profits from altcoins that have performed well or by increasing their Bitcoin exposure. Understanding these shifts is key to making informed decisions. Historically, periods of a declining Altcoin Season Index have often preceded periods of Bitcoin outperformance, acting as a crucial indicator for savvy traders. Navigating the Market: Strategies During an Altcoin Season Index Decline Given the recent drop in the Altcoin Season Index , how should investors approach the market? It’s important not to panic, but rather to assess the situation strategically. Here are some actionable insights: Review Your Portfolio: Take a look at your current asset allocation. Are you comfortable with your altcoin exposure given the current trend? Research Strong Projects: Even during a ‘Bitcoin season,’ certain altcoins with strong fundamentals, innovative technology, or significant partnerships can still perform well. Deep research is always beneficial. Consider Bitcoin Exposure: If the trend continues, increasing your Bitcoin holdings could be a prudent move to capitalize on its potential strength. Practice Risk Management: Set stop-loss orders or take partial profits to protect your capital. Market conditions can change rapidly. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on other market indicators, news, and expert analyses to get a comprehensive view of the market. The market is dynamic, and the Altcoin Season Index is just one piece of the puzzle. Combining this information with other analysis tools can help you build a more resilient investment strategy. The Road Ahead: What Influences the Altcoin Season Index? The movement of the Altcoin Season Index is not isolated; it is influenced by a multitude of factors within the broader crypto ecosystem and global economy. Key elements that can sway the index include: Bitcoin’s Performance: As the dominant cryptocurrency, Bitcoin’s price action often dictates the overall market sentiment. Strong Bitcoin rallies can pull capital away from altcoins. Macroeconomic Trends: Global economic conditions, inflation rates, interest rate decisions, and geopolitical events can all impact investor appetite for riskier assets like altcoins. New Narratives and Innovations: Breakthroughs in specific sectors like DeFi, NFTs, or GameFi can temporarily ignite altcoin interest, but broader market trends often prevail. Institutional Adoption: Increased institutional investment often targets Bitcoin first, potentially strengthening its dominance. While the recent drop suggests a shift, the crypto market is known for its rapid reversals. The Altcoin Season Index could recover if new catalysts emerge to fuel altcoin growth. However, for now, the signal points towards a period where Bitcoin might take the lead. The recent drop in the Altcoin Season Index to 64 is a significant development that demands attention from cryptocurrency investors. It signals a potential shift in market dynamics, moving away from broad altcoin outperformance towards a stronger Bitcoin presence. While this doesn’t mean the end for altcoins, it does highlight the importance of adaptability and informed decision-making. By understanding what the index signifies and adjusting your strategy accordingly, you can better navigate the evolving crypto landscape and position your portfolio for success. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? A1: The Altcoin Season Index is a metric that indicates whether a majority of altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin over a 90-day period. A reading above 75 suggests an ‘altcoin season,’ while a lower reading implies a ‘Bitcoin season.’ Q2: What does a reading of 64 signify for the Altcoin Season Index? A2: A reading of 64, especially after a drop, indicates that fewer than 75% of the top altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. While not yet a full ‘Bitcoin season,’ it suggests weakening altcoin momentum relative to Bitcoin. Q3: Should I sell all my altcoins if the Altcoin Season Index drops? A3: Not necessarily. A drop in the Altcoin Season Index is a market indicator, not a definitive sell signal. It encourages investors to review their portfolios, research strong projects, and consider risk management strategies rather than making hasty decisions. Q4: How often does the Altcoin Season Index change? A4: The Altcoin Season Index is updated daily, reflecting the continuous performance comparison between altcoins and Bitcoin over the rolling 90-day period. Q5: What is considered a ‘Bitcoin season’? A5: A ‘Bitcoin season’ typically occurs when Bitcoin significantly outperforms most altcoins. While there isn’t a universally agreed-upon index number, a reading well below 50 on the Altcoin Season Index often points to such a period. Q6: Are there any benefits to a Bitcoin season for altcoin investors? A6: Yes, a Bitcoin season can present opportunities. It might allow investors to accumulate Bitcoin, which could then fuel a subsequent altcoin rally. It also allows for a re-evaluation of altcoin holdings, focusing on projects with stronger long-term potential. Did you find this analysis helpful?

By bridging BTC into SOL’s DeFi ecosystem, BTC gains instant settlement, programmable use cases, and access to lending, borrowing, and yield opportunities. The best form of Bitcoin is literally on Solana, citing the network’s ability to transform BTC from a static store of value into a dynamic, productive asset. Solana Sensei, the Founder of Sensei holdings and Namaste group, has highlighted on X that 66% of all wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) traders are on the Solana network. He supports this claim with the reasons why people are choosing to hold and use their BTC on SOL. Why Solana’s Speed And Low Fees Change The Game Solana is extremely cheap in transactions, a stark contrast to the $5 to $50+ fees often seen on the Bitcoin or Ethereum networks for the same move. With transaction finality in approximately 400 milliseconds, BTC transfers on SOL become nearly instant, compared to the minutes or hours of waiting on other chains. SOL’s capacity to process 65,000 TPS allows it to handle BTC at an internet-scale without network congestion.

Also, BTC becomes programmable in SOL DeFi, NFT, and RWAs, without the need for bridges across multiple chains. This integration transforms BTC into a dynamic, productive asset that can be used for lending, staking, and liquidity provision or structural products in ways that are not possible on the native BTC chain. BTC custody solutions, such as tBTC, sBTC, or the Wormhole BTC, combined with SOL’s high validator count and Jito MEV protection, are making it secure to use BTC on the network. Bitcoin on SOL pairs with USDC and USD1, which are the stablecoins that dominate settlement volume across all chains. With products like the SOL Mobile Saga and Seeker, there are instant BTC swaps and BTC payments on mobile. As the focus on SOL increases, the network is becoming a hub for ETFs and RWAs, with institutional flows ramping up. Meanwhile, Wrapped BTC on SOL will be directly plugged into that liquidity. Earning Native Bitcoin on Solana Through mSOL Analyst CPrinz, the on-chain Researcher, has revealed a new partnership between Marinade, SOL’s leading staking platform with 10 million and $1.7 billion in total value locked, and Zeus Network.

Though XRP is still among the most popular altcoins in circulation, investors also have eyes on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a $0.035 DeFi token that has become a much-discussed token during its presale period. Unlike hype plays, MUTM lending and borrowing procedures render it feasible in the real world, so it gets interest from retail traders as well as institutional investors on the hunt for the next crypto giant. As whale transactions continue to rise throughout the industry, XRP and MUTM are both shaping up to become significant cryptos to watch in 2025. XRP Price Analysis Amid Whale Action XRP is currently trading at $3.00. Whale addresses have risen recently: on-chain activity shows a steep drop of 90% of XRP reserves on Coinbase, suggesting accumulation by whale holders and reduced available supply. Resistance is building at $3.18, with support evident at the $2.95-$3.05 level, so that zone is most critical for direction of the next move. Compared with new XRP, some investors are looking to MUTM as having greater upside when the bull run takes off. Breaking Records at an Early Stage Stage 6 of MUTM presale is undervalued at $0.035. More than 16,470 customers have bought tokens and the project itself has gained more than 16.15 million. This is a clear signal that market demand is increasing and also hype on launch is increasing as well. Mutuum Finance is using the Chainlink oracles on ETH, MATIC and AVAX token lending, borrowing and liquidity insurance premia. Fallback oracle parameters, composite data feeds and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages are utilized with redundant security. For that, the multi-step approach will ensure that price data is normalized irrespective of the scale of market conditions. Collateral management protocol is directly affected by the deviation of the market. Liquidation values and LTV values are divided on the basis of stability in assets. Risk token ratio can be lower and risk-free token ratio can be higher. Its reserve’s multiplier is used proportionally 10% in low risk and 35% in highest risk as buffer which does not damage the diversification. The protocol works accordingly in risk management as well as liquidity management in its attempts to work optimally in the illiquid position flipping. Risk exposures are strongly correlated with one another, as well as the liquidation level being fixed. ETH and stablecoins are used as security assets to enable the increase of the ancillary LTV levels to collateralize risk assets using lower-risk assets. The reserve factors opportunity and reserve safety risk are optimized by proportional assets class. Mutuum Finance seeks to revolutionize DeFi. There is a giveaway of early adopter tokens where 10 individuals receive $10,000 MUTM and $100,000 giveaway is offered. Where to Put Your Money The whale-driven XRP momentum and Mutuum Finance presale success also reflect two distinct investment opportunities for crypto investors during 2025. XRP price action remains closely tied to large holder action, with resistance at $3.18, whereas MUTM’s presale has garnered over 16,470 contributors and raised over $16.15 million. With this combined momentum of strong investor interest and growing adoption, MUTM emerges as the token to keep an eye on. Long-time investors looking for access to winning market players and innovative DeFi protocols may want to get in early.

His recent endorsement of Coinbase’s Base Layer 2 network has sparked considerable interest, signaling a significant vote of confidence. Buterin views Base not just as another scaling solution, but as a Layer 2 built “in the right way,” perfectly aligning with Ethereum’s core philosophy. This perspective offers crucial insights into the future of decentralized applications and how they can achieve mainstream adoption while maintaining foundational security. Why is Base Layer 2 ‘Built the Right Way’? Vitalik Buterin’s praise for Base stems from its unique design philosophy. He highlighted that while Base incorporates centralized features to enhance user experience, its fundamental security architecture remains firmly rooted in Ethereum’s robust, decentralized base layer. This distinction is vital for understanding why Base stands out. Buterin emphasized that Base does not directly hold user funds. This non-custodial approach means that, unlike some centralized platforms, Base cannot unilaterally seize assets or block withdrawals. Such a design choice significantly bolsters trust and security, reassuring users that their digital assets remain under their control, even when interacting with a faster, more user-friendly Layer 2 solution. Balancing User Experience with Decentralized Security One of the persistent challenges in blockchain technology has been the trade-off between scalability, user experience, and decentralization. Many solutions often sacrifice one for the others. However, Buterin sees Base Layer 2 as a compelling example of finding a harmonious balance. Enhanced User Experience: Base leverages certain centralized aspects to deliver a smoother, faster, and more intuitive experience for users and developers. This can include faster transaction finality and lower fees, which are critical for mass adoption. Ethereum’s Security Backbone: Crucially, these centralized elements do not compromise the underlying security. Base’s security guarantees are inherited directly from Ethereum. This means that even if parts of Base were to face issues, the integrity of user funds and transactions is ultimately protected by Ethereum’s battle-tested blockchain. Non-Custodial Design: As Buterin pointed out, the inability of Base to seize funds or block withdrawals is a cornerstone of its “right way” design. This principle is fundamental to the ethos of decentralization, ensuring users retain sovereignty over their assets. Understanding Ethereum’s Layer 2 Philosophy Ethereum’s long-term vision for scalability heavily relies on Layer 2 solutions. These networks process transactions off the main Ethereum chain, bundling them together and then submitting a compressed proof or summary back to the mainnet. This approach dramatically increases transaction throughput and reduces costs without burdening the core blockchain. Buterin’s endorsement of Base Layer 2 reinforces the idea that L2s should complement, not compete with, Ethereum. They extend its capabilities, allowing it to handle a global scale of users and applications. Base’s commitment to relying on Ethereum for security and finality perfectly embodies this collaborative philosophy, making it a valuable addition to the ecosystem. The Crucial Role of Non-Custodial Design Why is the non-custodial nature of Base so significant? In the world of finance, custodianship implies control over assets. For a Layer 2 network, being non-custodial means that even if the L2 operator experiences technical difficulties or malicious intent, they cannot prevent users from accessing their funds on the underlying Ethereum network. This is a critical trust factor for any scaling solution. This design choice for Base Layer 2 provides a strong guarantee of user autonomy. It distinguishes it from centralized exchanges or platforms that do hold user funds, making it a more resilient and censorship-resistant option for decentralized applications and users alike. This commitment to user sovereignty is what makes Base a truly Ethereum-aligned scaling solution. What Does Base Layer 2 Mean for Ethereum’s Future? The success and design principles of Base have significant implications for the broader Ethereum ecosystem. As more users and developers flock to Layer 2 solutions, networks like Base demonstrate that it is possible to achieve high performance and user-friendliness without sacrificing the core tenets of decentralization and security that define Ethereum. This positive validation from Vitalik Buterin encourages other Layer 2 developers to adopt similar best practices. It fosters a healthier, more secure, and ultimately more scalable environment for decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and other Web3 applications. The continued growth of robust Layer 2s like Base is essential for Ethereum to realize its full potential as the world’s leading programmable blockchain. In conclusion, Vitalik Buterin’s praise for Coinbase’s Base Layer 2 is a powerful affirmation of its design and alignment with Ethereum’s foundational principles. By prioritizing security through Ethereum’s base layer and adopting a non-custodial approach, Base offers a compelling model for future scaling solutions. It shows that we can achieve a superior user experience while upholding the core values of decentralization and user sovereignty, paving the way for a more accessible and robust Web3 future.

This sudden Bitcoin price drop has naturally sparked concerns and questions among investors and enthusiasts alike. What exactly caused this swift downturn? An in-depth analysis by XWIN Research Japan, a respected CryptoQuant contributor, points to a confluence of four critical factors that collectively pushed Bitcoin lower. Macroeconomic Headwinds: The Fed’s Stance and the Bitcoin Price Drop One primary driver of the recent Bitcoin price drop stems from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s hawkish monetary policy. While the Fed did implement a 0.25 percentage point interest rate cut in September, Chair Jerome Powell’s subsequent signals indicated a reluctance towards further monetary easing. This stance has significant implications for risk assets like Bitcoin. The Fed’s position led to an increase in U.S. Treasury yields. It also strengthened the dollar’s value against other currencies. Historically, a stronger dollar and higher yields tend to make riskier investments less attractive. In stark contrast, gold, often seen as a safe-haven asset, surged to an all-time high of $3,745 per ounce during this period. Regulatory Roadblocks and Investor Sentiment: Impact on Bitcoin Price Drop Adding to the market’s woes, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced delays on decisions for several cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These postponements naturally dampened short-term investor sentiment. Such regulatory uncertainty often creates a hesitant environment for potential buyers. Furthermore, spot BTC ETFs, which had previously seen significant inflows, recorded net outflows during this period. Although large-scale investors were observed “buying the dip,” their purchasing activity was not enough to counteract the immediate supply-demand imbalance. This imbalance further contributed to the downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Miner Sell-Offs: A Key Contributor to the Bitcoin Price Drop On-chain data provides another crucial piece of the puzzle regarding the Bitcoin price drop . It revealed a notable trend: miner holdings have decreased by approximately 9% in recent months. Miners are often forced to sell their newly minted or held Bitcoin on exchanges. This selling activity is typically driven by the need to cover rising operational costs. These costs include electricity, hardware maintenance, and other infrastructure expenses. When a significant portion of miners sell their assets, it increases the available supply in the market, pushing prices lower. Futures Market Volatility: Accelerating the Bitcoin Price Drop The futures market played a dramatic role in accelerating the recent Bitcoin price drop . Roughly $1.7 billion in liquidations occurred over a 24-hour period, with the vast majority consisting of long positions. A liquidation happens when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses. When long positions are liquidated, it involves forced selling, which can rapidly amplify downward price movements. The analysis also highlighted the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), an on-chain indicator that gauges the overall profitability of Bitcoin holders. The SOPR approached a value of one, suggesting that many investors were selling at break-even or even at a loss, indicating widespread capitulation. In summary, the recent Bitcoin price drop was not a singular event but rather the culmination of multiple interconnected factors. From the macroeconomic pressures exerted by the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance and regulatory delays from the SEC, to significant selling pressure from miners and a cascade of liquidations in the futures market, each element played a role. Understanding these drivers is essential for investors navigating the volatile cryptocurrency landscape and preparing for future market movements. Frequently Asked Questions About the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop What were the main factors contributing to the recent Bitcoin price drop? The primary factors included the U.S. Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance, SEC delays on crypto ETF decisions, significant miner sell-offs, and large liquidations in the futures market. How did the Federal Reserve’s actions impact Bitcoin? The Fed’s reluctance towards further monetary easing led to higher U.S. Treasury yields and a stronger dollar, making risk assets like Bitcoin less attractive to investors. Why did Bitcoin miners sell off their holdings? Miners sold off approximately 9% of their holdings to cover rising operational costs, such as electricity and hardware maintenance, increasing the supply of Bitcoin on exchanges. What role did the futures market play in the price decline? The futures market saw about $1.7 billion in liquidations, predominantly of long positions. These forced sales rapidly accelerated the downward price movement of Bitcoin. What is the SOPR indicator, and what did it suggest during the price drop? The Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) is an on-chain indicator showing holder profitability. During the drop, it neared a value of one, indicating that many investors were selling at break-even or even at a loss.

For many, the idea of turning crypto’s unpredictable swings into a steady stream of returns seems like a distant dream. However, an innovative product named Pendle Boros is making this a reality, as highlighted in a recent report from Tiger Research, a respected Asia-focused Web3 firm. This new offering from Pendle Finance is skillfully converting the often-erratic funding fees from cryptocurrency futures into something truly groundbreaking: fixed, predictable returns. What Exactly is Pendle Boros and How Does It Work? Traditionally, institutional investors have used “delta-neutral” strategies to capitalize on funding fees in the futures market. This involves simultaneously holding long and short positions to neutralize price risk, hoping to collect the periodic funding payments. However, this approach isn’t without its challenges. The direction of these payments can shift unexpectedly with market sentiment, turning what was intended as a low-risk strategy into a volatile gamble. This is where Pendle Boros steps in with a clever solution. It uses a specialized derivative to completely separate the funding fee component from the underlying crypto asset. Think of it like this: You no longer need to hold the actual BTC or ETH to gain exposure to its funding fees. Boros allows you to trade the funding fee itself as a distinct financial product. By doing this, Pendle Boros effectively transforms exposure to the inherent volatility of funding fees into a stable, fixed-income stream. This innovative mechanism creates a much more predictable return structure for participants, a significant advancement for DeFi. The Genius Behind Pendle Boros: Turning Risk into Reward The core innovation of Pendle Boros lies in its ability to isolate and tokenize the funding fee. This means users can now access these fees without taking on the typical price risk associated with holding the underlying assets. Tiger Research specifically noted the immense potential of minimizing risk in what were previously considered delta-neutral strategies. This move democratizes access to a sophisticated financial maneuver, making it available to a broader range of investors looking for stability.

Speaking at the London School of Economics, Bailey said watchdogs across the financial sector needed to invest “heavily in data and data science” to make sense of the vast quantities of information they already collect from banks, insurers and other firms. “We’ve all got to invest heavily in data and data science, and techniques,” he said. “None of us, I think, can put our hand on our heart to say that we’re sort of optimally using it all.” Bailey added that regulators may not make the most out of the data they collect due to a lack of usage. He said, “It also creates the danger for the authorities that you’ve got the evidence in the building and you haven’t been able to use it and it subsequently comes out that somewhere in your system was the smoking gun.” Bailey spots a data challenge for supervisors The BoE, along with other regulatory bodies such as the Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ), gathers millions of data points annually from the firms it supervises. Bailey’s comments highlight a recurring challenge among supervisors, which is the fact that actionable insights may be missed when using manual analysis and reporting techniques. Adding AI to the fray may open the door for more insights to the data. Last year, the Bank of England ’s own survey found that 75% of UK financial services firms already use some form of artificial intelligence, with another 10% planning adoption in the next three years. The most common applications include fraud detection, anti-money laundering checks, and cybersecurity monitoring. Yet the report also flagged growing risks associated with the use of AI, one of which is data quality and data bias among others. Resisting deregulation pressures Bailey’s remarks also come amid political debate over the UK’s regulatory stance . In July, finance minister Rachel Reeves described financial rules as a “boot on the neck of businesses,” prompting Bailey to push back. He argued that efforts to boost the economy should not lead to a tone down of regulation as it can lead to risky behavior in the banking sector that could imperil the wider economy. “We can’t compromise on basic financial stability,” Bailey said. Analysts note that regulators face a delicate balancing act, on the one hand, fostering innovation and competitiveness in the UK’s financial hub; on the other, safeguarding consumers and financial stability. Opportunities for increased AI adoption While Bailey framed AI as an opportunity, experts caution that the technology is not a one-size-fits-all solution for the industry. AI systems can produce false positives, miss subtle anomalies, or embed biases that reflect flaws in underlying data. For regulators, it can be risky despite its merits, as they could either rely too heavily on opaque algorithms or fail to explain enforcement actions that stem from machine-driven insights. A recent report showed that no UK bank ranks in the global top 10 for AI talent, underlining the skills gap regulators and industry alike must bridge. This gives credence to Bailey’s statement, and increased adoption may have to accelerate both in the public sector and in the private sector. However, it is also worthy to note that a recent survey by the Tony Blair Institute found that more Britons view AI as an economic risk than an opportunity, reflecting concerns over job losses, privacy, and fairness.

Bitcoin was last down about 1.8% near $112,561, while Ethereum fell 3.3% to $41,197, BNB dropped 4% to $991.3, and Solana slid 6.2% to $219.03. In the past 24 hours, about $1.7b of mostly long positions were wiped out, the largest long liquidation event this year, Coinglass said . Macro Boost Meets Micro Headwinds, FTX Cash Returns And Sentiment Sours Flows into crypto funds remained a bright spot last week. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $556m in net inflows, lifting total net assets to $29.6b, according to SoSoValue. Over the same period, spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $886.6m, taking total net assets to $152.31b. GM! The biggest long liquidation so far this year. 24h long liquidation:$1.62B Total liquidation in the past 24 hours: $1.70B. https://t.co/C47AgBCcTk pic.twitter.com/IeIiCgz0zL — CoinGlass (@coinglass_com) September 22, 2025 Macro signals set the stage. The Federal Reserve cut rates by 25 basis points last week to a target range of 4.00% to 4.25%, and signaled two more possible cuts this year. That first move initially buoyed altcoins, which rallied into the weekend. Momentum faded on Monday. Sentiment cooled shortly after the defunct crypto exchange FTX said it will begin its third distribution on Sept. 30, returning about $1.6b to holders of allowed claims as part of its Chapter 11 process. Social gauges turned more cautious. Analysts at Santiment noted on Sunday that more traders are now “betting that the price of Bitcoin will go down, as opposed to betting that Bitcoin’s price will go up,” and said they were seeing a “much more negative narrative forming across social media.” Liquidation Spike Signals Possible Local Low As Funding Turns Negative Positioning also shifted. 10X Research said that sharp liquidation spikes often mark local lows and can raise the odds of a rebound, a view supported by negative funding rates that show faster traders are net short. The note urged traders to weigh positioning, technical signals and how the market is priced into October before buying dips. Industry executives framed the sell-off as a leverage flush rather than a fundamental break. Maja Vujinovic, CEO and co-founder of Digital Assets at FG Nexus, said, “Roughly $1.7B in liquidations reflects excess leverage, not failing fundamentals. Overheated funding post-Fed left traders exposed; once Bitcoin rolled over, forced unwinds hit ETH and alt-books hard.” “But history shows that these ‘leverage washes’ often mark a healthier base. With spot demand, ETF flows, and stablecoin rails intact, we’re more likely heading into consolidation than capitulation and that typically precedes the next sustained leg higher,” she added. Liquidations Drive ‘Margin Call Avalanche,’ Traders See Healthy Reset Traders echoed that view on market structure. Doug Colkitt, initial contributor to Fogo, said, “This is crypto’s version of a margin call avalanche. When Bitcoin sneezes, the entire market catches leverage flu. $1.7B in liquidations isn’t fundamentals breaking—it’s over-levered traders getting rinsed. Leverage is always highest at the top, and when prices roll over, the cascade feeds on itself.” “These flushes are brutal, but they’re also healthy. They reset leverage, shake out weak hands, and clear the runway for the next leg. If you’ve been around crypto long enough, then you already know the cold hard truth: liquidations are the feature, not the bug,” he said. Others pointed to Bitcoin’s relative resilience. Mike Maloney, CEO at Incyt, said, “The $1B+ liquidation wave was driven by long liquidations. The exuberance following an ATH, the anemic Fed cut, and a mismatch of reporting and risk creates a breakdown. The real capture here is that BTC is still the king of crypto markets: despite weathering the worst liquidation, BTC decline and volatility are a fraction of other assets. This suggests to me that the market will bounce up strongly on the back of BTC’s liquidity.” As September draws to a close, traders are watching funding, ETF flows, and the pace of redemptions from bankruptcy estates. For now, the market has reset leverage and attention turns to whether dip buyers step in ahead of October.

Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s price is rising again, leaving investors with the question of whether another big surge is on the way. Grayscale Revises Filing To Launch Dogecoin ETF Under Ticker GDOG Grayscale has updated its filing with the SEC to turn its current Dogecoin Trust into a full ETF. If the SEC approves, the fund will trade on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol GDOG. Regular investors will be able to purchase shares of the ETF and gain exposure to Dogecoin in a regulated manner. Related Reading: XRP Fractal Suggests Price Could Rise Over 100% To $7 In November The updated filing names Coinbase for two roles. The exchange will act as the custodian, responsible for safely holding the fund’s Dogecoin, and it will also operate as the prime broker, managing the primary trading activities associated with the exchange-traded fund. Wall Street has already shown signs of demand for exchange-traded fund products. Rival Osprey’s Dogecoin ETF, which trades under ticker DOJE, pulled in $17 million in its first trading session. Grayscale could be aiming to match or even surpass that success with its own Dogecoin ETF, as the race to bring meme-coin ETFs to the market intensifies. SEC Fast-Track Rules Boost Dogecoin ETF Momentum As Crypto Products Surge Recent rule changes at the SEC are making the approval process for ETFs much quicker. A good example came earlier this year with Grayscale’s CoinDesk Crypto 5 ETF, also known as GDLC. That fund, which tracks the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap, drew $22 million in inflows on its first day. Analysts, such as Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas, said this debut was significantly stronger than the average ETF launch, indicating that investors are ready for regulated crypto baskets. Related Reading: Pundit Shares ‘XRP Endgame’: What To Watch Out For With Ripple With the SEC moving more quickly, dozens of new ETF filings surface. The quicker timeline is creating buzz in the market and also pushing asset managers to bring their products forward sooner than planned. For Grayscale, the timing of its Dogecoin ETF filing appears well-planned. Meanwhile, Dogecoin itself is already moving higher. Between September 15 and 18, the token climbed from $0.26 to above $0.28, an 8% gain in just three days. Large investors, often referred to as whales, have been purchasing hundreds of millions of tokens, which in turn encouraged smaller traders to follow suit. Right now, the key for Dogecoin is holding above the $0.28 level. If it can stay there while the ETF approval process moves forward, traders believe there could be room for another surge. With Grayscale pushing for its ETF and investors already active in the market, Dogecoin is again in the spotlight as one of the most-watched tokens in crypto.

In the video, Willie claims that the current XRP price is not natural and powerful players are artificially holding it down. According to Willie, the goal of this move is to acquire more XRP at low prices due to its expected role in the future of global finance. Jim Willie Accuses Institutions Of Stalling The XRP Price Dr. Jim Willie explains that large banks and financial institutions are not letting the XRP price rise in value at this stage. He says this is not by accident but by design. In his words, what appears to be a flat market is, in reality, a stall created by influential players. According to Willie, these institutions believe XRP will be a key part of the financial system in the future. That is why they are working to build their holdings while the asset remains cheap. Instead of letting the market decide its fair price , they are making sure the cost stays low long enough for them to collect more. Banks And Institutions Push For XRP Below $3 Willie goes further by naming some of the groups he believes are involved. He points to BlackRock as one of the major players working to keep XRP under pressure. He even calls BlackRock “a disgustingly corrupt private equity firm” instead of a bank, making clear how negative his view of them is. Willie also says big players may ask Ripple to go along with this plan. He claims the big players are asking Ripple to help keep XRP under $3 so they can buy massive amounts. According to him, they do not want to buy XRP at $7 or $8, which is where he believes the market already values the asset. Instead, they want Ripple’s help to hold it down, giving them time to buy what he calls “a boatload” of tokens at bargain prices. These statements, shared by Aljarrah, suggest that the current market price of XRP may not be a natural one. If Willie’s claims are valid, then what people see is not simply a matter of supply and demand but a coordinated effort by strong financial groups to control the XRP price and reap the most significant benefits. Many traders and investors have long worried that digital assets do not move freely, but rather, powerful hands behind the scenes actively shape them. Within the digital asset ecosystem, where trust and transparency are already constant issues, such claims strike at the heart of ongoing debates about whether ordinary investors are getting a fair market or one designed to benefit only the most prominent institutions.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-23 02:00:47

Recently, the crypto community watched closely as UXLink faced a significant exploit. However, UXLink has now announced a pivotal development: the majority of the UXLink frozen assets have been successfully secured. This swift action offers a glimmer of hope and demonstrates a proactive approach to managing security breaches within the blockchain ecosystem. What Happened During the UXLink Exploit and What Was the Immediate Response? The incident began with a suspicious transaction valued at $11.3 million, which quickly sent ripples through the market. This led to a sharp decline in the UXLINK token’s value, naturally causing concern among its users and the wider crypto community. Understanding the gravity of the situation, UXLink acted with remarkable speed. UXLink officially confirmed the exploit and the associated transaction. They immediately initiated measures to freeze the majority of the stolen assets. This rapid response was crucial in preventing further dissipation of the funds. This quick freezing of the UXLink frozen assets highlights the importance of robust incident response protocols in the blockchain space. It shows that even in the face of sophisticated attacks, swift action can mitigate potential damage. Securing User Funds: Are Individual Wallets Safe? One of the most pressing questions following any crypto exploit is the safety of individual user funds. UXLink has provided a reassuring update on this front. The project explicitly stated that there is currently no evidence suggesting individual user wallets were compromised during the attack. This distinction is vital. It implies the exploit targeted a different aspect of the protocol, rather than directly breaching personal user accounts. UXLink’s focus remains on protecting its community. To bolster their investigation and recovery efforts, UXLink has teamed up with a renowned blockchain security firm, PeckShield. This collaboration brings significant expertise to the table, ensuring a thorough and professional approach to securing the remaining UXLink frozen assets and understanding the attack vector. The Path to Recovery: UXLink’s Compensation Plans Beyond freezing the stolen funds, UXLink is committed to a comprehensive recovery strategy. The project is not just stopping at asset recovery; it is also actively developing concrete recovery and compensation plans for any affected accounts. This commitment underscores their dedication to user trust and platform integrity. The ongoing investigation with PeckShield is a critical step in this process. Their expertise will help trace the flow of funds and identify the perpetrators, paving the way for potential asset recovery. Moreover, transparent communication about these plans is essential for maintaining community confidence. This proactive stance on compensation and recovery demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility, aiming to restore normalcy and trust for those impacted by the exploit. The swift action to identify and secure UXLink frozen assets is a testament to their commitment. What Does This Mean for the UXLINK Token and Community? While the initial exploit caused a significant dip in the UXLINK token’s value, the announcement regarding the UXLink frozen assets offers a positive counter-narrative. The ability to secure most of the stolen funds can help stabilize investor sentiment and potentially aid in the token’s recovery. For the community, this news is a powerful message: UXLink is serious about security and user protection. It reinforces the idea that even when challenges arise, effective measures can be implemented to safeguard assets and rebuild trust. The project’s dedication to working with security experts and planning for user compensation reflects a mature approach to blockchain security. In conclusion, UXLink’s decisive action to freeze the majority of stolen assets following a recent exploit is a significant development. By collaborating with PeckShield and committing to recovery and compensation plans, UXLink is demonstrating a strong dedication to security and its user base. While the incident was a setback, the rapid response regarding the UXLink frozen assets offers a clear path forward towards recovery and enhanced trust in the platform’s future.

52125493,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=207899,1758593713,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/52125493.jpeg,WisdomTree CoinDesk 20 Fund: Crucial Delaware Registration Signals Big Crypto Move,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/wisdomtree-coindesk-20-fund-delaware/,"BitcoinWorld WisdomTree CoinDesk 20 Fund: Crucial Delaware Registration Signals Big Crypto Move Are you ready for the next wave of institutional cryptocurrency adoption? WisdomTree, a renowned asset manager, has taken a significant step forward by registering a corporate entity for its WisdomTree CoinDesk 20 Fund in the U.S. state of Delaware. This move, while not an official ETF filing just yet, is widely seen as a crucial preliminary action before submitting formal application documents to financial regulators. It signals a growing institutional interest in bringing diversified crypto exposure to a broader investment audience. What Does This WisdomTree CoinDesk 20 Fund Registration Mean? Understanding the distinction between a corporate entity registration and an ETF filing is key. When WisdomTree registered the WisdomTree CoinDesk 20 Fund in Delaware, it established the legal framework for a potential future investment vehicle. Think of it as laying the foundation for a house before submitting the blueprints for construction approval. Preliminary Step: This registration creates a legal shell, an operating entity, for the fund. It’s a necessary precursor to more complex filings. Intent Signifier: It clearly indicates WisdomTree’s serious intent to launch a product tied to the CoinDesk 20 Index. Not an ETF (Yet): It’s important to remember this isn’t an immediate green light for an Exchange Traded Fund. ETF applications involve rigorous regulatory scrutiny from bodies like the SEC. This strategic move allows WisdomTree to prepare the necessary legal and operational structures, streamlining the process once they are ready to pursue an official fund offering, potentially a spot crypto ETF. Why Did WisdomTree Choose Delaware for its CoinDesk 20 Fund? Delaware’s appeal as a jurisdiction for incorporation among U.S. financial and investment funds is undeniable, and it’s no surprise that WisdomTree opted for it when establishing the WisdomTree CoinDesk 20 Fund entity. The state offers a compelling package of advantages that make it a go-to choice for sophisticated financial structures. Business-Friendly Environment: Delaware boasts a legal system renowned for its predictability and responsiveness to corporate needs. Tax Benefits: The state offers various tax advantages for corporations incorporated there, which can be beneficial for fund structures. Flexible Corporate Structures: Its corporate laws provide significant flexibility in structuring entities, allowing for innovative fund designs. Established Precedent: Many leading financial institutions and investment vehicles are incorporated in Delaware, creating a familiar and trusted environment. This choice underscores WisdomTree’s careful planning and adherence to best practices in fund management, aiming for an efficient and robust operational foundation. Exploring the CoinDesk 20 Index: What Assets Will the Fund Track? The name “CoinDesk 20 Fund” itself points directly to the underlying assets it intends to track: the CoinDesk 20 Index. This index is a carefully curated benchmark designed to represent the broader digital asset market, focusing on liquidity and market capitalization. The CoinDesk 20 Index tracks 20 major cryptocurrencies, offering a diversified exposure rather than focusing on a single digital asset. These typically include: Bitcoin (BTC): The pioneer and largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Ethereum (ETH): The leading smart contract platform. XRP (XRP): A prominent payment-focused cryptocurrency. Solana (SOL): A high-performance blockchain platform. Cardano (ADA): A blockchain platform known for its research-driven approach. By tracking such a diversified index, the potential WisdomTree CoinDesk 20 Fund aims to provide investors with broad exposure to the crypto market’s top performers, mitigating some of the volatility associated with single-asset investments. What Are the Potential Benefits for Investors with a WisdomTree CoinDesk 20 Fund? Should the WisdomTree CoinDesk 20 Fund eventually launch as a regulated investment product, it could unlock several compelling benefits for both retail and institutional investors looking to enter the digital asset space. Diversified Exposure: Instead of picking individual cryptocurrencies, investors would gain exposure to a basket of 20 major digital assets. This diversification can help spread risk. Ease of Access: A regulated fund would simplify the process of investing in crypto, removing the complexities of direct ownership, private keys, and secure storage.

The Road Ahead: Challenges for the WisdomTree CoinDesk 20 Fund While the Delaware registration is a positive indicator, the journey from corporate entity to a fully operational, regulated fund, especially a spot crypto ETF, is often fraught with challenges. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. remains complex and evolving.

An address, strongly suspected of belonging to Ethena infrastructure firm StablecoinX, has recently made waves by pulling a massive 73.56 million ENA tokens, valued at approximately $43.88 million, from various exchanges over the past seven days. This substantial move, initially reported by AmberCN, has sparked considerable discussion among market observers. Such large-scale withdrawals are not just random transactions; they often signal a strategic decision to hold assets rather than actively trade them on exchanges. What Does This ENA Withdrawal Signify? When a major entity like StablecoinX executes such a substantial ENA withdrawal , it usually points towards a long-term holding strategy. Instead of keeping tokens readily available for sale on an exchange, moving them to an external wallet suggests a commitment to holding these assets for an extended period. This could be interpreted in several ways: Confidence in ENA’s Future: The firm might have strong conviction in the future value and utility of the ENA token. Strategic Accumulation: It could be part of a broader plan to accumulate a significant stake in ENA, potentially for governance participation or to support future ecosystem developments. Reduced Selling Pressure: By removing tokens from exchanges, the immediate selling pressure on ENA could be lessened, which might be a positive signal for the token’s price stability. Understanding these movements is crucial for anyone tracking the Ethena ecosystem and the broader stablecoin landscape. StablecoinX’s Role and the ENA Token Explained StablecoinX is an infrastructure firm closely associated with Ethena, a synthetic dollar protocol. Ethena’s USDe, a synthetic dollar, aims to provide a censorship-resistant, stable, and scalable digital currency solution. The ENA token is central to the Ethena ecosystem, often serving governance functions or playing a role in the protocol’s stability mechanisms. Therefore, any major action by a firm linked to Ethena, especially concerning a significant ENA withdrawal , draws immediate attention. This particular movement highlights the interconnectedness of infrastructure firms and their associated tokens. Their actions can often provide insights into the perceived health and future direction of a project. Is this a sign of bullish sentiment, or is there more to uncover about StablecoinX’s intentions behind this substantial move? How Do Large Withdrawals Impact the Crypto Market? Large token withdrawals, like this recent ENA withdrawal , can have several implications for the market: Market Perception: They can create a perception of scarcity or strong demand, potentially influencing investor sentiment positively. Price Dynamics: While not a direct buy order, removing tokens from liquid exchange pools can reduce the available supply for sale, which theoretically could support price appreciation if demand remains constant or increases. Transparency and Trust: In the crypto space, on-chain movements offer a degree of transparency. When a known entity makes such a move, it adds another layer to market analysis, allowing the community to speculate on motivations and potential outcomes. However, it is important to remember that market reactions are complex and influenced by numerous factors beyond a single withdrawal event. While the immediate interpretation leans towards holding, the long-term impact will depend on StablecoinX’s subsequent actions and broader market conditions. What Are the Potential Challenges and Future Outlook for ENA? While a large ENA withdrawal might seem positive, there are always challenges to consider. The concentration of significant token holdings in a few addresses can sometimes raise questions about decentralization and potential market manipulation, although there’s no indication of such here. For Ethena and ENA, the long-term success hinges on continued adoption of USDe, robust protocol stability, and transparent governance. Looking ahead, market participants will be keenly watching for further on-chain movements from StablecoinX and other key Ethena stakeholders. Will these ENA tokens remain dormant, or will they be deployed in new ways within the ecosystem? The answers to these questions will shape the narrative around ENA’s future trajectory. The Intriguing Case of the StablecoinX ENA Withdrawal The recent ENA withdrawal by the suspected StablecoinX address is a fascinating case study in on-chain analytics and market interpretation. It underscores how significant movements by key players can provide valuable clues about their strategies and outlooks. While typically seen as a bullish signal for holding, the true impact will unfold over time as Ethena continues to develop and the broader crypto market evolves. Staying informed about such developments is key to navigating the dynamic world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is ENA? A1: ENA is the governance token for Ethena, a synthetic dollar protocol that offers USDe, a stablecoin solution. ENA holders often have a say in the protocol’s future development and parameters. Q2: Who is StablecoinX? A2: StablecoinX is an infrastructure firm suspected of being closely related to the Ethena protocol, playing a role in its underlying operations or support. Q3: Why is a large ENA withdrawal considered significant? A3: A substantial ENA withdrawal from exchanges typically indicates that the holder intends to keep the tokens for the long term rather than selling them immediately. This can signal confidence in the asset’s future and potentially reduce immediate selling pressure. Q4: Does this withdrawal guarantee ENA’s price will go up? A4: No, a single withdrawal does not guarantee price appreciation. While it can be a positive signal by reducing immediate supply, ENA’s price is influenced by many factors, including overall market sentiment, Ethena’s adoption, and broader economic conditions. Q5: How can I track such crypto movements? A5: You can track large crypto movements using blockchain explorers and on-chain analytics platforms, which provide transparent data on transactions, wallet balances, and token flows.

Analysts reviewing crypto charts in 2025 are now nominating Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the project designed to repeat that historic playbook, projecting a similar 60x path by the end of 2026. With its presale in progress and an ecosystem that blends lending, stablecoin demand, and staking rewards, MUTM is drawing attention as the token where outsized gains are expected to emerge. Dual lending system sets a wider adoption base While most platforms launch with narrow features, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will arrive with a two-sided lending model that addresses both institutional-grade assets and retail’s appetite for higher-risk tokens. On one side, the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system will let users lend and borrow stablecoins and leading cryptocurrencies such as ETH and BTC, while earning interest that dynamically adjusts with pool utilization. On the other hand, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) arm will support trading pairs for riskier tokens, including meme coins, giving traders more choice without exposing the main liquidity pools to volatility. This dual structure is designed to appeal to both conservative investors seeking steady yield and adventurous traders searching for higher rates. It ensures the broadest adoption base from day one, creating activity that fuels protocol revenues. Borrowing will always remain overcollateralized, and stability will be maintained through liquidation rules and incentives for liquidators to execute at a discount. The design reflects lessons learned from past lending platforms while introducing flexibility that aligns with today’s crypto predictions for diversified ecosystems. By combining these mechanics with the upcoming stablecoin pegged at $1, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is expected to create a natural anchor of demand. Every loan that mints or repays the stablecoin will lock users into the ecosystem, generating ongoing flows that ultimately cycle back into token value. Presale FOMO and long-term ROI justification Looking at crypto prices today, the presale momentum is already validating interest. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 at a price of $0.035, having raised $16.20M with 47% of the phase allocation sold. Over 16,500 holders are already on board, with the next Phase 7 price climbing to $0.040, a 15% increase. Security confidence is reinforced with a CertiK audit that recorded a 90.00 Token Score and a 79.00 Skynet Score. To further expand trust, the team is running a $50,000 bug bounty program as well as a $100,000 giveaway that will reward ten winners with $10,000 each. Future demand drivers extend beyond presale numbers. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will allow mtToken users to stake their positions to earn MUTM rewards, with treasury revenues allocated to buybacks that will be redistributed to stakers. Layer-2 integration ensures transactions remain fast and low-cost, granting a competitive moat over higher-fee alternatives. Furthermore, a beta launch on testnet is scheduled upon listing, guaranteeing that the platform will be functional on day one. Exchange visibility will then amplify adoption by attracting liquidity and additional users. The investment logic is straightforward. At today’s $0.035 presale price, analysts forecast a rise to approximately $2.10 by the end of 2026. That equals a 60x gain, mirroring the journey Solana (SOL) took in 2020 and 2021 when its utility and listings pushed prices into the mainstream. For an investor allocating $10,000 at current levels, this trajectory points toward $600,000 in less than two years, a multiple that Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) themselves once provided to their earliest supporters. As traders look back on what they learned from the past cycle, it’s evident that projects that provide value, incentives for adoption, and excellent tokenomics are the most successful. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a $1-anchored stablecoin, lending, staking incentives, and a roadmap that supports quick adoption. It seems like it will be the cryptocurrency that follows the 2021 model. In conclusion, Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have already shown that they can change portfolios. Now, new entrants are in the spotlight. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has the structure, mechanisms, and presale traction to take that title. Analysts think that anyone who looks at crypto charts in the next cycle will see MUTM climb by the same amount, 60 times, by the end of 2026. This makes it one of the best solutions when looking at crypto prices today.

Volatility often drives attention, but it also exposes weaknesses in tokens that lack real mechanics. Analysts now argue that projects with built-in stabilizing features stand to dominate the next cycle. That is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the spotlight, presenting itself as a presale token with a structure built to absorb volatility and thrive as the market moves toward the 2026 season. Why stability amid volatility matters Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not simply another presale project riding hype; it is designed with mechanisms that will directly counteract volatility. At the core of its system lies a decentralized stablecoin pegged to $1, minted only when users post collateral such as ETH or BTC. Every loan will be overcollateralized, and issuer limits will prevent excessive exposure by any single participant. Governance will adjust interest rates dynamically to preserve the peg—when the stablecoin price dips below $1, borrowing will become more expensive, and when it rises above $1, borrowing costs will ease. This system will be reinforced by arbitrage opportunities that naturally bring the price back in line. The accuracy of price discovery is another advantage. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will rely on Chainlink feeds as its main oracle provider, but will also maintain fallback oracles and aggregated data from decentralized exchanges. This triple-layer design will ensure that collateral valuations and liquidation thresholds are based on precise data rather than sudden swings. In a market where investors often ask why crypto is going up or down in extreme ways, having a lending system anchored in transparent and accurate data sets MUTM apart. Investors already recognize the value in this approach. The presale has entered Phase 6 with $16.20 million raised and 47% of the 170 million tokens in this stage already sold. The current price is $0.035, but once Phase 7 begins, that price will climb to $0.040, representing a 15% uplift. More than 16,500 holders are already participating, signaling growing conviction that MUTM represents a hedge against the volatility cycles of the market. For those focused on crypto investing during uncertain periods, this urgency becomes a natural incentive to act before the presale moves forward. Liquidity and borrowing rates are also structured with resilience in mind. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s model will automatically raise borrowing costs when liquidity is scarce, encouraging deposits into the system. When liquidity is abundant, rates will decrease, driving demand for loans. This self-regulating cycle ensures that both lenders and borrowers remain incentivized regardless of wider market turbulence, keeping the system stable even when other tokens falter. Future staking mechanics further strengthen this foundation. Users will be able to stake their mtTokens, receive MUTM rewards, and also benefit from open-market MUTM buybacks funded by platform revenue. These buybacks will then be redistributed to stakers, creating a reinforcing cycle of participation and rewards that operates independently of daily market swings. For investors wondering what is going on with crypto today, it often comes down to which tokens can generate sustainable returns regardless of market mood—and MUTM is positioning itself as one of them. Building a roadmap that reduces exposure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has laid out a detailed roadmap designed to lower exposure to volatility as the project matures. Phase 1 focused on presale launch and audit processes. Phase 2 will involve building out smart contracts and the DApp front end. Phase 3 will finalize systems on testnet with bug reporting, while Phase 4 will take the platform live with exchange listings, compliance alignment, and multi-chain expansion. Each stage will add structural strength and credibility, making the system less exposed to external shocks as adoption grows. Security and community initiatives reinforce this reliability. The CertiK audit awarded MUTM a TokenScan score of 90 and a Skynet score of 79, confirming strong security standards. On top of that, a $50,000 bug bounty program is in place, with rewards ranging from $200 for low-severity issues to $2,000 for critical findings. To energize participation, the project is also running a $100,000 giveaway where ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens.

After a brief period of inflows, these prominent investment vehicles experienced a significant reversal, recording notable Spot Crypto ETF Outflows on September 22. This shift has sparked discussions among investors and analysts alike, prompting a closer look at what drove these movements and their potential implications for the broader digital asset landscape. What Triggered These Dramatic Spot Crypto ETF Outflows? On September 22, both US spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs collectively observed net outflows, effectively ending a two-day streak of positive inflows. This sudden reversal indicates a potential shift in investor sentiment or market dynamics. Understanding the specifics of these Spot Crypto ETF Outflows is crucial for anyone tracking the pulse of the crypto market. Data from Trader T revealed that spot Bitcoin ETFs alone registered total net outflows amounting to $363.17 million . This substantial figure highlights a notable selling pressure across several key funds. Fidelity’s FBTC led the pack with $276.68 million in outflows. Ark Invest’s ARKB followed, seeing $52.30 million depart. Grayscale’s GBTC, a long-standing player, recorded $24.65 million in outflows. VanEck’s HODL also contributed with $9.54 million . Interestingly, BlackRock’s IBIT and several other funds reported zero flows on this particular day, indicating a concentrated selling activity in specific products rather than a market-wide exodus. How Did Ethereum ETFs Respond to the Spot Crypto ETF Outflows? The trend of net outflows wasn’t limited to Bitcoin. Spot Ethereum ETFs also faced considerable pressure, collectively experiencing $76.06 million in net outflows during the same period. This indicates a broader market sentiment affecting both major cryptocurrencies. Fidelity’s FETH accounted for $33.12 million of the outflows. Bitwise’s ETHW saw $22.30 million withdrawn. BlackRock’s ETHA registered $15.19 million in outflows. Grayscale’s Mini ETH contributed $5.45 million to the total. These figures underscore that while Bitcoin ETFs saw larger absolute outflows, Ethereum ETFs also experienced a significant cooling of investor interest. Such synchronized movements often suggest overarching market factors rather than isolated fund-specific issues. What Are the Broader Implications of These Spot Crypto ETF Outflows? The reversal from inflows to substantial Spot Crypto ETF Outflows could signal a few things. It might reflect profit-taking by investors after recent market rallies, or it could indicate a cautious stance due to macroeconomic uncertainties. Moreover, such movements can influence market sentiment, potentially leading to increased volatility in the short term. For investors, monitoring these ETF flows provides valuable insights into institutional and retail sentiment. Significant outflows can sometimes precede price corrections, offering an opportunity for strategic re-evaluation. Conversely, sustained inflows often suggest growing confidence in digital assets. It is important to remember that ETF flows are just one metric among many. A holistic view, considering on-chain data, macroeconomic indicators, and regulatory news, is essential for making informed decisions in the dynamic crypto space. These Spot Crypto ETF Outflows serve as a reminder of the market’s inherent volatility and the need for continuous vigilance. In summary, the recent dramatic Spot Crypto ETF Outflows from US Bitcoin and Ethereum funds mark a notable shift in the investment landscape. While a two-day inflow streak was broken, these movements are a natural part of a maturing market. They highlight the ebb and flow of investor confidence and the dynamic nature of digital asset investments. As the market continues to evolve, keeping a close eye on these ETF trends will remain crucial for understanding broader sentiment and potential future directions.

The breakout above that line was followed by a pullback into a $0.24–$0.25 zone where support showed up. If the memecoin holds above that base, momentum could push toward $0.30, with further upside possible to $0.32–$0.35 — levels the token traded at earlier this year.

Market cap sits near $36 billion while 24-hour volume surged to about $4.7 billion — up 180%. Circulating supply is steady at 151.04 billion DOGE, and the volume-to-market-cap ratio sits at 13.04%, a sign of unusually aggressive activity from both large holders and retail traders.

A suspected address linked to Railgun (RAIL), a prominent zero-knowledge (zk) privacy protocol, recently executed a substantial Railgun ETH deposit . This transaction saw 2,992 ETH, valued at an impressive $12.49 million, transferred to the Kraken exchange just an hour ago, as reported by Onchain Lens. This event isn’t just a large transfer; it brings critical discussions about privacy, transparency, and the evolving landscape of decentralized finance to the forefront. What Exactly Was This Railgun ETH Deposit Unpacked? For those closely watching the blockchain, the movement of such a large sum from a privacy-focused protocol to a centralized exchange is noteworthy. The address in question is believed to be associated with Railgun, a protocol designed to enhance transactional privacy on Ethereum and other chains. When we talk about a Railgun ETH deposit , we’re referring to funds that have potentially passed through or originated from a privacy-preserving mechanism before landing on a major exchange. The Amount: A staggering 2,992 ETH, equating to nearly $12.5 million. The Destination: Kraken, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges. The Source: A suspected address linked to Railgun, a zero-knowledge privacy protocol. The Implication: This raises questions about the use cases and regulatory scrutiny of privacy-enhancing tools. This particular Railgun ETH deposit highlights the constant tension between the desire for financial privacy, a core tenet of crypto, and the increasing demands for transparency from regulators and centralized entities. Why Does a Railgun ETH Deposit Spark Concern for Privacy? Railgun is built on zero-knowledge proof technology, which allows users to make transactions without revealing their wallet addresses or transaction history to outsiders. This technology is a powerful tool for individuals seeking to protect their financial privacy in a public ledger environment. However, the anonymity provided by such protocols can also be exploited for illicit activities, leading to increased scrutiny from authorities globally. The movement of a large Railgun ETH deposit to an exchange like Kraken immediately triggers discussions around several key areas: Privacy vs. Compliance: How do privacy protocols coexist with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations that exchanges like Kraken must adhere to? Source of Funds: While Railgun offers privacy, the origin of funds entering the protocol remains a point of interest for compliance teams. Market Impact: Large deposits to exchanges can sometimes signal an intent to sell, potentially impacting market dynamics, although this is not always the case. Understanding the balance between user privacy and regulatory obligations is crucial for the sustainable growth of the crypto ecosystem. This recent Railgun ETH deposit serves as a stark reminder of these ongoing challenges. Navigating the Future of Privacy Protocols After This Railgun ETH Deposit The crypto community often champions privacy as a fundamental right, viewing protocols like Railgun as essential infrastructure. However, the broader financial world and governmental bodies frequently express concerns about the potential for such tools to facilitate untraceable transactions, leading to illicit finance. This creates a complex environment for developers and users alike. The recent Railgun ETH deposit underscores a broader trend: the increasing pressure on privacy protocols to demonstrate their commitment to combating illicit use, even while upholding user anonymity. This might involve: Enhanced Audits: More rigorous security and compliance audits for privacy solutions. Community Dialogue: Open discussions within the crypto community about responsible use of privacy tools. Technological Innovation: Development of “transparent privacy” solutions that offer anonymity while allowing for selective disclosure when legally required. The path forward for privacy protocols is likely to involve a delicate dance between innovation and regulation, seeking solutions that satisfy both user needs and broader societal concerns. What Does This Railgun ETH Deposit Mean for the Average Crypto Holder? For the everyday crypto user, events like the suspected Railgun ETH deposit to Kraken serve as important reminders. Firstly, it highlights the ongoing debate about privacy in a transparent blockchain world. Secondly, it reinforces the need for users to understand the protocols they interact with and the implications of using privacy-enhancing services. It is important to remember that not all transactions involving privacy protocols are illicit. Many users simply value their financial anonymity, similar to how traditional banking offers private transactions. However, the “suspected” nature of this specific address places it under a spotlight, prompting further investigation and discussion within the industry. Key Takeaways: On-chain monitoring tools are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Privacy protocols are under continuous scrutiny. The intersection of decentralized finance and centralized exchanges remains a critical point of interest. Ultimately, the crypto space continues to evolve rapidly, with new challenges and innovations emerging constantly. The discussion around this Railgun ETH deposit is just one piece of the larger puzzle. The suspected Railgun ETH deposit to Kraken represents more than just a large sum of money changing hands. It symbolizes the ongoing tension between privacy and transparency in the digital asset space. As privacy protocols like Railgun continue to innovate, they will undoubtedly face persistent questions regarding their role in the broader financial ecosystem. This event serves as a crucial point of discussion, prompting the community to consider how to best balance the fundamental right to privacy with the imperative for regulatory compliance and security. The future of decentralized privacy hinges on finding this equilibrium. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Railgun? A1: Railgun is a zero-knowledge (zk) privacy protocol designed to allow users to make transactions on blockchains like Ethereum without revealing their wallet addresses or transaction history. It uses zk-SNARKs to provide anonymity. Q2: Why is a “suspected address” linked to Railgun depositing ETH to Kraken significant? A2: This event is significant because it highlights the ongoing debate between financial privacy and regulatory compliance. While Railgun offers anonymity, large deposits from such protocols to centralized exchanges like Kraken often draw scrutiny due to potential concerns about the source of funds and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. Q3: Does this mean Railgun is used for illicit activities? A3: Not necessarily. Many legitimate users value privacy for various reasons, similar to traditional banking. However, the anonymity offered by protocols like Railgun can be exploited. The term “suspected address” indicates that the transaction is under review or has raised flags, but it doesn’t automatically confirm illicit activity. Q4: How do centralized exchanges like Kraken handle deposits from privacy protocols? A4: Centralized exchanges like Kraken are subject to strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. They typically have sophisticated monitoring systems to flag suspicious transactions, including large deposits from privacy protocols, and may freeze funds or accounts if they cannot verify the source or legitimacy of the assets. Q5: What is a “zero-knowledge (zk) privacy protocol”? A5: A zero-knowledge (zk) privacy protocol uses cryptographic methods to allow one party to prove to another that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. In the context of crypto, it means you can prove you own funds or made a transaction without revealing your identity or specific transaction details. The conversation around privacy and transparency in crypto is more vital than ever. What are your thoughts on this significant Railgun ETH deposit ?

That figure comes alongside a broader tally of 48 violent incidents recorded globally, a level that exceeds last year’s totals. Around 35 of those incidents were reported since late February, signaling a rapid uptick in a short time. The spike has left law enforcement and the crypto community watching closely. Attacks Spike In Six Months Investigators and security analysts say the rise is linked to more people holding larger sums of crypto and the growing visibility of holders’ wealth. France alone reported 14 incidents this year, making it one of the harder-hit countries. Many of the episodes involved coercion: victims were forced to move funds or surrender access to wallets. In some cases, attackers used threats or physical violence to get what they wanted. Each incident, while different, points to a common pattern — criminals targeting self-custody holders because they can be forced to transfer funds on the spot. What Types Of Violence Were Seen? The range of attacks is broad. Kidnapping attempts and robberies have been documented. There are also so-called “wrench attacks,” where someone is hurt or threatened until they reveal a password or sign a transfer. Some victims were pushed to make immediate transactions under duress while others lost access after being forced to disclose private keys. Based on reports, forced transfers make up a large share of the newer incidents. This kind of crime sidesteps many of the digital protections that wallets provide. How The Community Is Responding Security firms and advocacy groups are urging better personal safety practices. Advice being circulated includes reducing public displays of wealth, using multisig setups that require multiple people to sign transactions, and keeping cold storage physically secure. Some experts say privacy measures should be strengthened so that ownership and balances are harder to trace. Reports have suggested that law enforcement capacity varies by country, leaving some victims with fewer options for quick help. What Security Experts Recommend Law enforcement officials have been asked to coordinate more closely with crypto firms and security teams. Some jurisdictions are starting to track these crimes more carefully and to issue alerts. Still, experts warn that storing large sums in single, easily accessible places raises risk. Users are being told to plan for worst-case scenarios and to treat physical safety as part of their crypto risk management.

The price is trading below $4,280 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $4,360 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it settles above $4,250 and $4,320. Ethereum Price Dips Sharply Ethereum price failed to continue higher above the $4,550 zone and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH price declined below the $4,450 and $4,350 support levels. The bears even pushed the price below $4,120. A low was formed at $4,000 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor recovery wave above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $4,636 swing high to the $4,000 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $4,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,220 level.

An upside break above the $4,360 region might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,450 resistance zone or even $4,550 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,220 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,120 level. The first major support sits near the $4,050 zone. A clear move below the $4,050 support might push the price toward the $4,000 support.

This unauthorized issuance, which occurred just an hour before the official announcement, has sent ripples of concern through the community. It’s a critical reminder of the ever-present risks in the decentralized finance space, urging immediate attention from all users. What Exactly Happened with the UXLINK Tokens? In a swift and alarming development, UXLink publicly announced on X that a malicious actor had successfully minted 1 billion UXLINK tokens . This wasn’t a legitimate issuance; the project quickly clarified that these tokens were created without authorization and do not adhere to their official white paper. Consequently, UXLink has declared these newly minted tokens invalid. The immediate implication for users is stark. UXLink has strongly advised against trading these UXLINK tokens on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Engaging with these unauthorized assets could lead to significant financial losses for unsuspecting traders. Why is This UXLINK Tokens Incident Critical for Users? This recent incident isn’t isolated. It follows closely on the heels of a suspicious $11.3 million transaction linked to the project, which previously caused a notable plummet in the UXLINK price. Such events severely test investor confidence and highlight the vulnerabilities that even established projects can face. For anyone holding or considering trading UXLINK, the current situation demands extreme caution. The project’s explicit warning to avoid DEX trading is paramount.

The facility is backed by CleanSpark’s Bitcoin holdings and aims to fund “accretive growth using non-dilutive financing,” Gary A. Vecchiarelli, CFO at CleanSpark, wrote in a statement. The company said the proceeds will support energy buildouts, mining capacity and new high-performance computing projects. “We see tremendous opportunity to accelerate mining growth while simultaneously optimizing our assets, particularly those near major metro centers and in our immediate pipeline,” CleanSpark CEO Matt Schultz said. https://t.co/L1JUpVeoZr — CleanSpark Inc. (@CleanSpark_Inc) September 22, 2025 With BTC Holdings At $1.43b, CleanSpark Leans On Credit Rather Than Selling Coins The deal builds on earlier steps. CleanSpark expanded its facility with Coinbase Prime by up to $200m in April, part of a broader shift among miners toward revolving credit secured by Bitcoin rather than equity issuance or coin sales. Peers have moved in the same direction. Hut 8 doubled its line to $130m in June, while Riot Platforms tapped Coinbase for a $100m arrangement in April. These lines give miners flexibility to post BTC as collateral, preserve treasury balances and time market sales more carefully. CleanSpark holds 12,703 BTC, worth about $1.43b at current prices, and ranks among the largest public company holders, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data . The company said the added credit will help match capital needs with a network that keeps getting tougher. Record Hashrate And Lower Fees Squeeze Miner Margins, Costs Keep Rising Bitcoin’s hashrate and difficulty have reached records this year, while transaction fees fell below 1% of block rewards in August, reducing a variable revenue buffer. As a result, miners lean more on fixed subsidies and balance sheet tools to manage rising energy and equipment costs. Costs have also climbed due to hardware and logistics. As early as March, tariffs on imported rigs from Asia added to the burden, creating potential liabilities for past shipments and complicating procurement timelines for US operators. Even so, CleanSpark posted its strongest quarter last month , reporting revenue of $198.6m for its fiscal third quarter, up 91% from $104m a year earlier and ahead of analyst forecasts of about $195m. Net income rose to $257.4m, reversing a loss of $236.2m in the prior year period. BTC-backed financing now functions as a bridge between volatile cash flows and steady infrastructure needs. When prices are firm, collateral capacity rises and lines can be upsized. When prices soften, the structure can still reduce forced selling, especially when treasuries are significant. For miners, that mix of credit access, treasury management and network efficiency has become central to strategy.

This development sends a clear signal across the market, highlighting stringent measures to protect user interests and maintain market integrity. For investors, understanding the implications of such a review is crucial. Why is UXLINK Facing This Critical Review? South Korea’s leading crypto platforms, Upbit, Bithumb, and Coinone, have officially placed UXLINK on their watchlist for potential delisting. This isn’t a decision taken lightly; it stems from a thorough evaluation process designed to identify and mitigate risks within the digital asset ecosystem. Upbit, a primary exchange involved, detailed key reasons behind their decision to initiate the UXLINK delisting review: Inadequate Disclosure Post-Security Incidents: Following events like a hack, the project reportedly failed to provide timely and sufficient information to the exchanges and users. Transparency is paramount in crypto, especially when user funds might be at risk. Potential Risks to Users: Beyond disclosure issues, broader risks were identified that could negatively impact UXLINK token holders. This could encompass project stability or technical vulnerabilities. These findings underscore the importance of robust security protocols and open communication from project developers in the volatile cryptocurrency market. What Sparked These Alarming Concerns Around UXLINK? The current UXLINK delisting review is also fueled by recent, unsettling reports that have raised red flags across the industry. These reports suggest potential irregularities that could further jeopardize user trust and market stability. Suspicious $11.3 Million Transaction: A questionable transaction involving a substantial sum of $11.3 million has come to light. The nature and purpose of this transaction remain unclear, prompting concerns about financial transparency. Circulation of Unauthorized Tokens: Allegations of billions of unauthorized UXLINK tokens circulating in the market add to the complexity. Such an influx could dilute the token’s value, create market instability, and raise serious questions about the project’s tokenomics. These developments paint a picture of a project struggling with accountability and potentially engaging in practices that deviate from standard industry norms. The cumulative effect of these issues has undoubtedly contributed to the stringent UXLINK delisting consideration by South Korean exchanges. What Does This Urgent UXLINK Delisting Review Mean for Investors? For individuals holding UXLINK tokens, this delisting review serves as a critical warning. When major exchanges like Upbit, Bithumb, and Coinone flag a project, it often signals significant underlying problems that could impact the token’s future viability and liquidity. Investors should: Monitor Developments Closely: Stay updated on official announcements from exchanges and the UXLINK project team. The review’s outcome will directly affect the token’s status. Assess Risk Exposure: Evaluate current holdings and consider the potential loss of access to trading pairs if the token is ultimately delisted. Delisting can severely impact a token’s price and trading access. Diversify Portfolios: This situation reinforces the importance of diversification. It helps mitigate risks associated with individual project failures or regulatory actions. This move reflects increased regulatory scrutiny and a commitment to safeguarding investors. It’s a stark reminder that due diligence is absolutely essential. The decision by Upbit, Bithumb, and Coinone to place UXLINK under an urgent UXLINK delisting review is a significant event in the South Korean crypto market. It underscores the critical importance of transparency, robust security, and timely communication from project teams. As the review unfolds, the cryptocurrency community will be watching closely, understanding that such actions are vital for fostering a more secure and trustworthy environment for all participants. This situation serves as a powerful reminder for both projects and investors about the non-negotiable standards required for sustainable growth in the crypto space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does “delisting review” mean for UXLINK? It means exchanges are evaluating if UXLINK meets their listing standards. Failure could lead to removal from trading platforms, impacting liquidity and value. Which South Korean exchanges are involved in the UXLINK delisting review? Upbit, Bithumb, and Coinone are the major South Korean crypto exchanges involved. What are the main reasons cited for the UXLINK delisting review? Reasons include inadequate disclosures after security incidents, potential risks to users, a suspicious $11.3 million transaction, and alleged circulation of billions of unauthorized tokens. How might a delisting impact UXLINK token holders? Delisting could make it difficult to trade tokens on major exchanges, potentially causing a significant price drop and reduced liquidity. Holders might need to transfer tokens to other platforms. Is the UXLINK delisting guaranteed? No, a review is not a guaranteed delisting. It’s an evaluation period. However, it signals serious concerns the project must address to avoid removal. Found this article insightful? Share it with your network!

XRP Army Responds,https://timestabloid.com/can-xrp-reach-5-by-the-end-of-september-xrp-army-responds/,"Pumpius (@pumpius), a well-known crypto pundit, has raised a simple but striking possibility, predicting that XRP could reach $5 before September ends. The comment drew many responses from the XRP community, revealing a wide mix of optimism, skepticism, and caution. $5 XRP by the end of September is a real possibility. — Pumpius (@pumpius) September 20, 2025 XRP Army Reacts Pumpius described this move as a “real possibility,” and many supporters agreed, expressing confidence that an upward move is just around the corner. Some commenters predicted a slightly longer timeline, with one user stating that he expects October to be a decisive month. Another said she is prepared to celebrate if it happens, even though she sees it as a surprise. On the more cautious side, some community members pointed out that similar predictions have been made throughout the year, yet the anticipated breakout has not yet arrived. Not everyone dismissed the idea, though. One participant said that once the price begins to move, it will take off quickly. Another suggested that while the asset might achieve this feat, it would likely be suppressed by market manipulation . This wide range of perspectives captures the uncertainty within the community. Optimists remain hopeful for sudden price acceleration, while skeptics point to the absence of consistent follow-through in past rallies. Market Factors Driving Speculation The discussion comes at a time when macroeconomic shifts are giving digital assets new momentum. The Federal Reserve recently enacted highly anticipated rate cuts , creating conditions that many traders interpret as supportive for risk assets. Lower interest rates often reduce the appeal of traditional safe havens, redirecting capital toward higher-yielding opportunities such as cryptocurrencies. XRP is already one of the most closely followed tokens by institutional investors , and the community is anticipating rapid growth before the end of the month. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The prospect of XRP advancing toward $5 is tied to this broader environment of improving confidence and the perception that the market’s reaction to rate cuts could bring in fresh institutional participation. Anticipation for ETF Approvals The community is also closely watching October decisions on XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Similar products have already launched in markets such as Brazil and Canada, performing well since their introduction earlier this year. Approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would mark a significant step for XRP, opening the door for new categories of investors to gain exposure through regulated financial vehicles. The excitement for these products could help XRP reach this target before they are approved. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

While these top three coins remain strong, their sheer size means growth is steady but slower. Penny coins in early presale stages, however, can offer a sharper return profile. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , now live in its presale, is being highlighted by experts as the project with the potential to outperform the market by as much as 10x, making it one of the most talked-about names among investors looking at crypto prices today. Why analysts see MUTM as more than a penny coin What makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) more compelling than most presale projects is its concrete design. At its heart is a decentralized stablecoin pegged to $1, minted only when users lock approved collateral such as ETH or BTC. Loans will always be overcollateralized, ensuring the system maintains solvency even in sharp downturns. Governance will manage borrowing rates to keep the stablecoin in line with its peg: raising interest when the token trades under $1 and lowering it when above $1. Arbitrage will further tighten the peg, making the stablecoin both functional and reliable. Liquidation rules will protect lenders and borrowers alike. When collateral dips below defined thresholds, automatic liquidations will occur, and liquidators will step in at a discount to repay system debt. On top of this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will apply a reserve factor that varies based on risk—lower for stablecoins and majors like ETH, higher for volatile assets. That design shows an institutional-grade approach similar to what underpins the stability of a crypto ETF, but here applied directly within a decentralized lending ecosystem. The presale data confirms that investors are paying attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its token sale, with more than $16.2 million already raised and 47% of the 170 million tokens in this stage sold. The current price is $0.035, with the next stage set at $0.040, a 15% increase. More than 16,500 holders are already on board. Early participants from Phase 1, when tokens were priced at $0.01, are already sitting on a 3.5x value gain. This shows how quickly value has grown, even before exchange listings. Roadmap, security, and investment upside Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is aligning its development path with clear milestones. Phase 1 focused on presale initiation, audits, and early marketing. Phase 2 will deliver the smart contracts and DApp interface. Phase 3 will prepare for testnet and external reviews, while Phase 4 will bring the live launch, exchange listings, compliance, and multi-chain integration. Each step is structured to reduce uncertainty and demonstrate continued progress, building confidence among retail and institutional investors alike. Security anchors are also firmly in place. The MUTM smart contract has undergone a CertiK audit, earning a TokenScan score of 90 and a Skynet score of 79. Beyond external audits, the project has committed to a $50,000 bug bounty program, offering tiered rewards to white-hat testers from $200 up to $2,000 depending on severity. Alongside this, a $100,000 giveaway is running, distributing ten $10,000 in MUTMs to broaden community participation. With over 12,000 followers already engaged on Twitter, the social traction is expanding quickly. The numbers around investment math are what make analysts so bullish. A $1,000 purchase in Phase 1 at $0.01 is already worth $3,500 on paper. At a conservative post listing target of $0.50, that same $1,000 would equal $50,000—a 50x return. Even investors entering now at $0.035 are looking at $14,000 on the same $1,000 if the price reaches $0.50. Compared to Bitcoin (BTC)’s projected gains or Ethereum (ETH)’s trajectory, which analysts expect to move in the hundreds of percent range rather than thousands, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a presale coin with multiplier potential that directly challenges the return profiles of the top three coins. It’s not just a guess that the appeal is there. MUTM is building a system that will keep its value over time by using overcollateralized lending, liquidation safety nets, Chainlink, and fallback oracles to find the right price, dynamic interest rates, staking rewards, and future buybacks paid for by platform income. Many analysts think this depth makes it more than just a speculative cent coin. For investors who want to make money in a turbulent market, it’s important to find the right mix between upside and stability. Analysts agree that although top cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL will keep going up consistently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides the type of exponential return profile that is hard to see outside of early presales. Phase 6 is over half sold out, and the next price increase is coming up soon. Investors are not wondering whether MUTM has potential; they are asking if they will put themselves in a good position before this presale advantage ends.

This dramatic shift sent ripples through the trading community, leaving many to ponder the immediate future of their investments. If you’ve ever wondered what triggers such significant market movements and what they mean for your holdings, you’re in the right place. Understanding a Crypto Liquidation Event: What Happens When the Market Plunges? So, what exactly is a crypto liquidation event ? In simple terms, it’s the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange. This occurs when the market moves against a trader’s bet to a point where their margin (the collateral they put up) can no longer cover potential losses. Imagine you’re betting on a coin’s price to go up using borrowed money (leverage). If the price drops too much, the exchange automatically sells your holdings to cover the loan. This prevents further losses for both the trader and the exchange. These events are a common, albeit often painful, part of trading in volatile markets. They are particularly prevalent in perpetual futures contracts, which allow traders to speculate on price movements without an expiry date. When a cascade of these forced closures happens simultaneously, it can amplify price movements, leading to even more liquidations in a phenomenon often referred to as a ‘liquidation cascade.’ The Staggering Impact: ETH Leads This Massive Crypto Liquidation Event The recent figures are quite eye-opening, revealing the scale of this particular crypto liquidation event . Ethereum (ETH) bore the brunt of the impact, with a colossal $370 million in positions wiped out. What’s particularly striking is that 91.5% of these were ‘long’ positions, meaning traders were betting on ETH’s price to rise. ETH: $370 million liquidated, with long positions accounting for 91.5%. BTC: $250 million liquidated, with long positions accounting for 94.45%. SOL: $87.54 million liquidated, with long positions accounting for 96.09%. The overwhelming dominance of long liquidations across all major assets, especially Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL), indicates a widespread bullish sentiment that was abruptly challenged. Traders expecting prices to continue climbing were caught off guard by a swift market reversal, leading to significant losses for those utilizing high leverage. What Fueled This Dramatic Crypto Liquidation Event? Such significant crypto liquidation events are rarely isolated incidents. They often stem from a confluence of factors, primarily sudden and sharp price movements. These could be triggered by: Macroeconomic News: Unexpected economic data or geopolitical events can send traditional markets reeling, with crypto often following suit. Whale Movements: Large holders (whales) selling significant portions of their assets can trigger a downward spiral. Technical Factors: Breaking key support levels can lead to algorithmic trading and panic selling. Over-Leverage: When a market is saturated with highly leveraged long positions, even a small price dip can trigger a chain reaction of liquidations. While the exact catalyst for this particular event is subject to ongoing analysis, the sheer volume of long liquidations suggests that many traders were perhaps too optimistic, failing to account for potential downside risks in their leveraged strategies. Navigating Volatility: Key Takeaways for Crypto Traders This recent crypto liquidation event serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks in highly leveraged trading and the importance of robust risk management. For both seasoned traders and newcomers, understanding these dynamics is crucial for long-term success. Here are some actionable insights: Manage Your Leverage Wisely: Avoid excessive leverage, as it amplifies both gains and losses. Lower leverage means more room for error. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: These automatically close your position if the price drops to a predetermined level, limiting potential losses. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spreading investments across different assets can mitigate risk. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, sentiment, and technical analysis to make informed decisions. Understand Market Cycles: Crypto markets are cyclical. Volatility is a constant, and preparing for both uptrends and downtrends is key. By adopting a disciplined approach and prioritizing risk management, traders can better navigate the turbulent waters of the cryptocurrency market, even during dramatic events like the one we just witnessed. Summary: Lessons from a Turbulent 24 Hours The recent $707.5 million crypto liquidation event underscores the dynamic and often unforgiving nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such events can be daunting, they also offer invaluable lessons about risk, leverage, and market psychology. By understanding the mechanisms behind liquidations and implementing sound trading strategies, investors can better protect their capital and even identify potential opportunities amidst the volatility. Always remember, the crypto market rewards those who are prepared and disciplined. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a crypto liquidation? A crypto liquidation is the automatic closure of a leveraged trading position by an exchange when a trader’s margin falls below a required level, usually due to adverse price movements. It prevents the trader from incurring further losses beyond their collateral. 2. Why were long positions more affected in this particular crypto liquidation event? Long positions are bets that an asset’s price will increase. When the market experiences a sudden downward price movement, these long positions are the first to be liquidated as they move into negative territory, especially if they are highly leveraged. 3. How can traders protect themselves from a crypto liquidation event? Traders can protect themselves by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders to automatically close positions at a predetermined loss limit, maintaining sufficient margin, and diversifying their portfolios to spread risk. 4. Does a crypto liquidation event always mean the market is crashing? Not necessarily. While large liquidation events often accompany significant price drops, they can also occur during periods of high volatility without indicating a long-term market crash. However, they do signify substantial market pressure and a shift in sentiment. 5. What impact does high leverage have during market volatility? High leverage amplifies both potential gains and losses. During periods of high market volatility, high leverage significantly increases the risk of liquidation, as even small price movements against a position can quickly deplete a trader’s margin. 6. Is it possible to profit from a crypto liquidation event? While liquidations are detrimental to those being liquidated, experienced traders might identify opportunities to enter short positions before a cascade or buy assets at a discount after prices have dropped significantly. However, this strategy carries its own high risks. Did this article help you understand the recent market movements?

This isn’t just a technical fix; it’s a bold move to safeguard its entire ecosystem and protect its community from a relentless hacker. What Exactly Happened to UXLINK’s Token Supply? Imagine waking up to find your project’s token supply multiplied by a rogue actor. That’s the challenge UXLINK is currently facing. A hacker has been continuously minting unauthorized UXLINK tokens, creating an astronomical supply far beyond the official one billion limit. This unauthorized minting has already reportedly surpassed 10 trillion tokens, significantly dwarfing the legitimate supply. Such an imbalance threatens the very foundation of the project’s tokenomics. The immediate fallout has been significant. CoinMarketCap data showed a sharp 71.2% decrease in UXLINK’s value, trading at $0.09454. This drastic drop underscores the severity of the situation and the urgent need for intervention. In response, the project swiftly requested exchanges to halt UXLINK trading to prevent further damage and protect investors. Why is a UXLINK Token Swap the Best Solution? In times of crisis, swift and decisive action is paramount. UXLINK’s decision to conduct a UXLINK token swap is a direct and necessary response to this unprecedented attack on its tokenomics. But why is a swap the chosen strategy, and what does it entail? Protecting Tokenomics: The unauthorized minting directly threatens the scarcity and intrinsic value of legitimate UXLINK tokens. A swap allows the project to effectively reset the token supply, invalidating the hacker’s minted tokens and re-establishing a controlled, secure supply. Community Security: This measure is primarily designed to protect existing token holders. By exchanging old, potentially compromised tokens for new, secure ones, UXLINK aims to ensure that the value held by its loyal community is preserved and not diluted by the fraudulent supply. Regaining Trust: A successful and transparently executed swap can significantly help restore investor confidence. It demonstrates UXLINK’s commitment to robust security and its ability to respond effectively to major threats, fostering a sense of reliability. Essentially, the swap involves replacing the compromised UXLINK tokens with a brand-new, secure version. This action effectively cuts off the hacker’s ability to profit from their unauthorized minting. It’s a complex operation that demands careful coordination with exchanges and crystal-clear communication with all token holders. What Should UXLINK Holders Do Now? For anyone holding UXLINK tokens, this situation undoubtedly raises concerns and questions. Here are some actionable insights and crucial recommendations to help navigate this period: Stay Informed: Make it a priority to regularly check UXLINK’s official communication channels, such as their website and official social media accounts. This is where you’ll find the most up-to-date information regarding the token swap process, timelines, and specific instructions. Avoid Trading: It is imperative to adhere to the project’s request for exchanges to suspend trading. Attempting to trade compromised tokens during this sensitive period could lead to irreversible losses or significant complications. Prepare for the Swap: When the time comes, meticulously follow all official guidelines for exchanging your tokens. This will likely involve holding your tokens in a designated, secure wallet or on a participating, trusted exchange. While the short-term impact on price and trading can certainly be unsettling, remember that the long-term goal of the UXLINK token swap is to ensure the project’s stability and sustainable growth. This is a critical period that requires both patience and strict adherence to official instructions. Beyond the Swap: Lessons for Crypto Security The UXLINK incident serves as a stark reminder of the persistent and evolving security challenges within the cryptocurrency space. Even well-intentioned and innovative projects can unfortunately fall victim to sophisticated attacks. This event powerfully highlights the paramount importance of several key areas: Robust Audits: Regular, comprehensive security audits of smart contracts and underlying infrastructure are absolutely crucial. These audits help identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors. Real-time Monitoring: Implementing advanced systems that can detect and alert to unusual activity, such as massive unauthorized minting or suspicious transactions, is vital for a rapid and effective response. Emergency Protocols: Having clear, well-rehearsed emergency response plans, including transparent communication strategies and technical fixes like a UXLINK token swap , can mitigate damage significantly and protect the community. The resilience of the UXLINK community and the project’s proactive steps to implement this token swap will be instrumental in overcoming this hurdle and emerging stronger and more secure in the long run. A Crucial Step Towards Recovery and Trust The announcement of the UXLINK token swap marks a pivotal moment for the social infrastructure project. While the unauthorized minting by a hacker presented a formidable challenge, UXLINK’s rapid and decisive response demonstrates an unwavering commitment to its community and the integrity of its tokenomics. This isn’t merely a technical maneuver; it’s a strategic move to restore stability, rebuild trust, and ensure the long-term viability of the UXLINK ecosystem. By taking such decisive action, UXLINK aims to transform a crisis into an opportunity for enhanced security and renewed confidence, paving the way for a more secure and resilient future for its users and investors. This incident underscores the dynamic nature of the crypto world and the importance of adaptable security measures. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a UXLINK token swap? A UXLINK token swap is a process where existing UXLINK tokens (which may be compromised or diluted due to unauthorized minting) are exchanged for a new, secure version of the token. This effectively resets the token supply and removes any fraudulently minted tokens from circulation. 2. Why is UXLINK conducting a token swap? UXLINK is conducting a token swap in response to a security breach where a hacker continuously minted unauthorized tokens, far exceeding the official supply. The swap is a critical emergency measure to protect the project’s tokenomics, preserve the value for legitimate holders, and restore market integrity. 3. What should I do if I hold UXLINK tokens? If you hold UXLINK tokens, you should closely monitor UXLINK’s official communication channels for specific instructions regarding the token swap. Avoid trading your tokens until the official swap process is announced and completed. Be prepared to follow the guidelines for exchanging your old tokens for new ones. 4. How long will the UXLINK token swap process take? The exact timeline for a token swap can vary depending on the complexity and coordination required with exchanges and the community. UXLINK will provide detailed timelines through its official announcements. It is important to remain patient and follow their updates. 5. What are the long-term implications for UXLINK after the swap? In the long term, a successful and transparent UXLINK token swap aims to restore trust and stability to the project. By addressing the security breach decisively, UXLINK can demonstrate its resilience and commitment to its community, potentially strengthening its position in the social infrastructure space once the new, secure tokenomics are established.

The surge followed the US Federal Reserve’s long-anticipated interest rate cut last week. Investors were initially hesitant and treated the move as a “hawkish cut,” but sentiment improved as the week progressed. By Thursday and Friday, inflows accelerated, adding $746 million as markets reassessed the rate decision’s impact on crypto. Solana and XRP See Inflows According to the latest edition of ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report,’ by CoinShares, total assets under management climbed to a new year-to-date peak of $40.4 billion and now appear on track to meet or slightly surpass last year’s record inflows of $48.6 billion. Bitcoin attracted the biggest inflows last week, after securing $977 million. Short-Bitcoin products, on the other hand, continued to falter, recording $3.5 million in outflows and lowering total assets under management to a multi-year low of $83 million. Ethereum also gained momentum, receiving $772 million. Cumulative inflows for the year now stand at a record $12.6 billion. This has pushed total crypto assets under management to a staggering $40.3 billion. Solana brought in $127.3 million, XRP secured $69.4 million, and smaller inflows were seen in Sui with $2.1 million, Chainlink with $1.9 million, and Cardano with $1.1 million. Meanwhile, multi-asset investment products saw outflows of $38 million. The United States captured the largest inflows at $1.8 billion, followed by Germany with $51.6 million, and Switzerland with $47.3 million. Canada also raked in $21 million in inflows during the same period. Next up were Brazil with $9.3 million and Australia with $7.8 million. Market sentiment remained generally optimistic, although Sweden and Hong Kong posted modest outflows of $13.6 million and $3.1 million, indicating limited regional pullbacks. Market Meltdown Leading crypto assets slid into a fresh downturn on Monday as the market lost the bullish momentum it displayed last week. Bitcoin retreated more than 3% in the past day, briefly dipping below $112,300. Ethereum suffered an even sharper 6% decline and is trading near $4,202. Other major tokens also faltered as XRP dropped nearly 5%, Solana slid about 7%, and Dogecoin plunged close to 10%. The market-wide pullback instilled renewed selling pressure after days of optimism, which triggered a cascade of liquidations.

A significant development is on the horizon that could reshape how many interact with the Solana ecosystem. OKX, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, has officially announced the listing of SOL perpetual futures on its platform. This highly anticipated move is set to go live on September 26 at 10:00 a.m. UTC, offering an exciting new avenue for both seasoned traders and those looking to diversify their portfolios. What Are SOL Perpetual Futures and Why Are They Important? You might be wondering what exactly SOL perpetual futures are and why their arrival on OKX is such a big deal. In simple terms, perpetual futures contracts are a type of derivative product that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset, in this case, Solana (SOL), without ever owning the underlying asset itself. Unlike traditional futures, perpetual contracts have no expiry date, meaning traders can hold their positions indefinitely, as long as they meet margin requirements. Leverage Opportunities: These contracts enable traders to use leverage, amplifying potential gains (and losses) from price movements. Go Long or Short: Traders can profit from both rising (going long) and falling (going short) prices of SOL. Enhanced Liquidity: The introduction of SOL perpetual futures typically brings increased liquidity to the asset, making it easier to enter and exit positions. Why OKX’s Listing of SOL Perpetual Futures Matters for Traders OKX is renowned for its robust trading infrastructure and wide array of financial products. The decision to add SOL perpetual futures reflects Solana’s growing prominence in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT sectors. For traders, this listing translates into several key benefits: First, it expands the trading options available for Solana, allowing for more sophisticated strategies beyond simple spot trading. Second, it provides a regulated and secure environment for engaging in derivative trading, which is crucial for risk management. Moreover, OKX’s global reach means a larger pool of participants, potentially leading to tighter spreads and more efficient price discovery for SOL. This development is a clear indicator of Solana’s increasing institutional acceptance and its maturation as a blockchain platform. It signals confidence in SOL’s long-term viability and its role in the broader crypto market. Navigating the World of Perpetual Futures: Risks and Rewards While the opportunities presented by SOL perpetual futures are significant, it’s vital to approach them with a clear understanding of the associated risks. Leverage, while powerful, can magnify losses just as quickly as it can amplify gains. Therefore, a well-defined risk management strategy is not just recommended, but essential. Consider starting with smaller position sizes, especially if you are new to futures trading. Educate yourself on concepts like margin calls, funding rates, and stop-loss orders. OKX typically provides extensive educational resources to help users understand these complex instruments. Always remember that the crypto market can be volatile, and thorough research is your best ally. Successful trading often involves a combination of technical analysis, fundamental understanding of the asset (Solana in this case), and disciplined emotional control. Don’t chase pumps, and always trade with capital you can afford to lose. What’s Next for Solana and OKX Traders? The launch of SOL perpetual futures on OKX on September 26 marks an exciting milestone. This isn’t just about a new trading pair; it’s about the continued evolution of the crypto market and the increasing sophistication of trading tools available to participants. For those invested in Solana, this could mean greater market depth and potentially more stable price action as advanced trading strategies come into play. As the market gears up for this launch, traders should prepare by familiarizing themselves with OKX’s futures trading interface and understanding the specific contract details. The ability to effectively trade SOL perpetual futures can be a game-changer for portfolio management, offering new ways to hedge existing spot positions or capitalize on anticipated market movements.

Adam, a respected macro researcher at Greeks.live, a prominent crypto options analytics firm, highlighted this potential vulnerability. While Bitcoin also experienced a dip, its volatility was noticeably lower, drawing specific concern to ETH’s position. Why is the $4,000 Ethereum Price Level So Critical? The $4,000 level for Ethereum price isn’t merely a round number; it acts as a strong psychological support. Traders and investors often view such thresholds as significant barriers. When these barriers break, it can lead to accelerated selling pressure. Adam’s analysis underscores this point, indicating that a breach could signal a shift in market sentiment from cautious optimism to outright fear. This scenario might prompt a cascade of sell orders, pushing the Ethereum price further down. Understanding the Surge in Downside Risk for Ethereum Price In the intricate world of crypto options, the concern over a declining Ethereum price has grown considerably. This is evident in the intensifying ‘skew’ observed in the market. Essentially, the price of put options (which profit when the asset’s price falls) has significantly outpaced that of call options (which profit when the asset’s price rises). This imbalance reveals a strong market demand for protection against further drops in the Ethereum price . Investors are actively seeking to hedge their positions, suggesting a collective anticipation of potential bearish movement. What Does This Mean for Traders and Investors? Adam clarified that despite a generally optimistic outlook for the broader crypto market in the fourth quarter, many participants are prioritizing short-term risk management. This proactive approach is crucial, especially when assets like Ethereum are teetering on critical support levels. Increased Caution: Traders are less inclined to take aggressive long positions. Hedging Strategies: There’s a noticeable uptick in strategies designed to mitigate losses. Focus on Fundamentals: While technical levels are important, smart investors also re-evaluate Ethereum’s underlying strength. This period demands a careful balance between capitalizing on potential future gains and safeguarding existing capital against immediate threats to the Ethereum price . Navigating Volatility: Actionable Steps for Ethereum Holders Given the current market sentiment and the potential for a significant shift in Ethereum price , what steps can holders take? Set Stop-Loss Orders: This helps limit potential losses if the price falls below your acceptable threshold. Consider Portfolio Diversification: Spreading investments across different assets can reduce overall risk. Stay Informed: Continuously monitor market news, technical indicators, and expert analyses. Re-evaluate Risk Tolerance: Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your personal risk appetite. Explore Hedging Tools: For experienced traders, options contracts can offer a way to protect against downside movements. Beyond Short-Term Fears: The Long-Term Potential of Ethereum While short-term risks for Ethereum price demand attention, it’s equally important to consider Ethereum’s long-term potential. The network continues to be a cornerstone of the decentralized economy, powering countless DApps, DeFi protocols, and NFTs. Ongoing developments, such as scaling solutions and future upgrades, aim to enhance its efficiency and reduce transaction costs. This underlying strength provides a compelling argument for its long-term viability, even amidst temporary market downturns. Investors with a long-term horizon might view current dips as potential buying opportunities, provided they manage their risks effectively. The potential fall of Ethereum price below $4,000 represents a critical moment for the crypto market. While the broader outlook for Q4 remains hopeful, the immediate focus is clearly on risk management. The intensifying skew in the options market signals a collective caution among investors. Understanding these dynamics and implementing sound strategies is paramount for navigating the current volatility. Whether you’re a short-term trader or a long-term holder, staying informed and prepared is key to thriving in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why is the $4,000 level significant for Ethereum price? A1: The $4,000 level is considered a strong psychological support. A break below it could trigger increased selling pressure and a wider market decline as it signals a shift in investor sentiment. Q2: What is “skew” in the options market and what does it indicate for ETH? A2: In the options market, “skew” refers to the difference in implied volatility between out-of-the-money put options and call options. When the price of put options significantly exceeds call options, it indicates a strong demand for hedging against potential price drops, suggesting market participants anticipate downside risk for the Ethereum price . Q3: Is the overall outlook for the crypto market still optimistic for Q4? A3: According to the analysis, the prevailing outlook for the crypto market in the fourth quarter remains optimistic. However, many participants are currently prioritizing short-term risk management due to immediate market vulnerabilities, particularly concerning the Ethereum price . Q4: What are some actionable steps for Ethereum holders to manage risk? A4: Ethereum holders can consider setting stop-loss orders, diversifying their portfolios, staying informed about market trends, re-evaluating their risk tolerance, and for experienced traders, exploring hedging tools like options contracts to protect against potential declines in Ethereum price . Q5: Does this short-term warning negate Ethereum’s long-term potential? A5: Not necessarily. While short-term risks for the Ethereum price require attention, Ethereum’s fundamental strengths as a leading blockchain for DApps, DeFi, and NFTs, coupled with ongoing developmental upgrades, continue to support its strong long-term potential. Long-term investors often view such dips as potential buying opportunities. If you found this analysis insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

Institutions are no longer just observing; they are actively strategizing. Hyundai Card, a leading South Korean financial services provider, offers a fascinating glimpse into this transformation, signaling an inevitable future where digital assets seamlessly integrate with traditional financial systems. The Shifting Landscape: Why Cryptocurrency in Finance is Gaining Traction Hyundai Card is proactively adapting to the rapid evolution of digital assets. Their internal innovation strategy, built around a robust private cloud infrastructure, is a direct response to the growing influence of stablecoins and the accelerated adoption of artificial intelligence. This strategic pivot highlights a crucial understanding: the future of finance is inherently digital. Vice Chairman Chung Tae-young, a prominent figure at Hyundai Card, unequivocally states that cryptocurrency in finance , including stablecoins, will eventually secure a definitive place within the traditional financial sector. This isn’t just speculation; it’s a vision rooted in anticipating market shifts. Stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to stable assets like fiat money (e.g., USD) or commodities. They aim to minimize price volatility, making them attractive for transactions and a bridge between traditional and decentralized finance. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is enhancing capabilities across all financial operations, from fraud detection to personalized services, and its integration with blockchain systems promises even greater efficiencies. Navigating the ‘Uneasy Exploratory Phase’ for Cryptocurrency in Finance While the long-term vision for cryptocurrency in finance is clear, Chung acknowledges the current market reality. He describes it as an “uneasy exploratory phase,” where many participants are still operating without a well-defined strategy. This phase is characterized by: Uncertainty: Regulatory frameworks are still developing globally, leading to hesitation among traditional players. Complexity: The underlying technology, while powerful, can be intimidating without proper understanding. Volatility: While stablecoins address this for transactional purposes, the broader crypto market remains volatile, impacting investment decisions. Chung emphasizes that what truly matters is not grand, speculative gestures, but a fundamental understanding and hands-on experience with cryptocurrency and blockchain systems. This insight is critical for any institution looking to navigate the digital asset space effectively. Actionable Insights: Preparing for Cryptocurrency in Finance Integration For financial institutions, embracing cryptocurrency in finance requires a strategic, two-pronged approach: 1. Cultivating Fundamental Understanding This goes beyond surface-level knowledge. It involves delving into: Blockchain Technology: Understanding how distributed ledgers work, their security features, and various consensus mechanisms. Tokenomics: Grasping the economic models behind different cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. Use Cases: Identifying practical applications for digital assets within existing financial services, such as cross-border payments, asset tokenization, or lending. 2. Gaining Hands-On Experience Theoretical knowledge must be complemented by practical engagement.

R&D Investments: Dedicating resources to research and develop proprietary crypto-related technologies. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborating with established blockchain firms or fintech innovators to leverage their expertise. By taking these steps, traditional finance can proactively shape its role in the emerging digital economy, turning potential challenges into significant opportunities for growth and innovation. The Future of Cryptocurrency in Finance: An Inevitable Convergence? Chung Tae-young’s conviction underscores a growing sentiment among forward-thinking financial leaders. The integration of cryptocurrency in finance isn’t a question of “if,” but “when” and “how.” This convergence promises several benefits: Enhanced Efficiency: Blockchain can streamline operations, reduce settlement times, and lower transaction costs. New Revenue Streams: Digital asset services, custody solutions, and tokenized securities can open up novel business models. Global Accessibility: Cryptocurrencies can facilitate broader financial inclusion and seamless international transactions. Institutions like Hyundai Card, by focusing on robust infrastructure and deep practical knowledge, are positioning themselves at the forefront of this financial revolution. Their proactive stance demonstrates a commitment to not just survive, but thrive, in a world increasingly shaped by digital assets. In conclusion, the journey of cryptocurrency in finance is progressing from an uncertain exploration to an inevitable integration. Hyundai Card’s strategic foresight and emphasis on fundamental understanding coupled with hands-on experience offer a compelling blueprint for how traditional financial institutions can successfully adapt and innovate. The future is digital, and those who prepare now will undoubtedly lead the way. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Hyundai Card’s main strategy concerning digital assets? Hyundai Card is focusing on an internal innovation strategy centered on its private cloud infrastructure to adapt to the spread of stablecoins and the accelerated adoption of artificial intelligence. Why does Vice Chairman Chung Tae-young believe cryptocurrency will find its place in finance? Chung Tae-young believes that cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins, will eventually integrate into the traditional financial sector because of their inherent value proposition and the ongoing digital transformation of finance. What does Chung mean by the “uneasy exploratory phase” for the crypto market? This phase refers to the current state where many participants are operating without a clear, long-term strategy, navigating uncertainties like evolving regulations, market volatility, and the complexity of the underlying technology. How can financial institutions effectively prepare for cryptocurrency integration? Institutions should focus on cultivating a fundamental understanding of blockchain technology and tokenomics, and gain hands-on experience through pilot programs, R&D investments, or strategic partnerships.

Elevated exchange inflows threaten to crash Bitcoin (BTC) further below the important support level at $112,000. Bitcoin Tumbles, Will It Lose $112,000? Bitcoin fell from around $116,000 to as low as $111,800 earlier today, as the broader cryptocurrency market experienced volatility amid concerns about the US government shutdown. Prediction markets on Kalshi are currently giving a 70% chance of a shutdown in 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Supply Ratio Declines After Fed Cut, Setting Stage For $120,000 Test Commenting on today’s BTC price action, CryptoQuant contributor PelinayPA remarked that at the end of August and early September, almost 65,000 BTC were withdrawn from exchanges, which coincided with a price recovery in the digital asset. The analyst shared the following chart, which shows BTC withdrawals from exchanges. Typically, large outflows from trading platforms indicate that investors are moving their holdings to personal wallets – reducing immediate selling pressure and signaling a bullish trend. That said, recent trends suggest that such outflows have weakened. Specifically, since September 20, exchange data shows that more investors are choosing to keep their coins on exchanges. PelinayPA shared another chart which shows BTC deposits to exchanges. Notably, between September 17 and 19, Bitcoin inflows to exchanges surged to nearly 40,000, while the price tumbled to $117,000. For the uninitiated, high BTC inflows to exchanges usually imply that investors are moving their coins from private wallets to platforms where they can be sold, signaling increased selling intent. This creates short-term bearish pressure on price, as higher supply on exchanges can outweigh demand. The CryptoQuant analyst added that during the rally between September 7 and 15, BTC outflows from exchanges exceeded inflows, supporting bullish momentum. However, inflows surpassed outflows after September 17, triggering strong selling pressure and pushing BTC down to $112,700. She concluded: Inflows remain high while outflows are relatively weak, indicating short-term downside pressure. If outflows increase again, signaling accumulation, BTC could rebound strongly from the $112K zone. Otherwise, further downside risk remains. Should BTC Holders Be Worried? Bitcoin’s fall to $112,000 should not come as a surprise. Recent on-chain data had already hinted that BTC could be in trouble due to a lack of whale participation in the recent rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Faces Supply Squeeze As Scarcity Index Turns Positive Again It is worth highlighting that BTC’s latest fall in price came shortly after the US Federal Reserve (Fed) cut interest rates by 25 basis points. Although the flagship cryptocurrency fell, experts believe that it is still far from a real capitulation. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju recently predicted that BTC could top out at $208,000 during the ongoing market cycle. At press time, BTC trades at $113,175, down 2.1% in the past 24 hours.

Recently, a UXLink hacker executed a massive token swap, converting billions of UXLINK tokens into Ethereum. This incident has sent ripples through the market, highlighting the ever-present risks in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. What Did the UXLink Hacker Do? On-chain analytics firm Lookonchain brought to light a substantial transaction that has captured the attention of the crypto community. Six addresses, strongly suspected of belonging to the UXLink hacker , were observed swapping approximately 2.49 billion UXLINK tokens. These tokens were converted into 6,732 ETH, valued at an estimated $28.1 million, across various decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This move suggests a deliberate and coordinated effort to liquidate a significant holding of UXLINK. Lookonchain also noted that the hacker sold additional substantial volumes of UXLINK tokens on other exchanges. This multi-platform approach likely aimed to minimize market impact on any single exchange, although the sheer volume still had a profound effect. Understanding the Immediate Market Impact of the UXLink Hacker ‘s Actions The immediate aftermath of the UXLink hacker ‘s actions was stark. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the UXLINK token experienced a dramatic price reduction. It was reported to be trading at $0.1109, representing a staggering decrease of 80.09%. Such a steep drop underscores the volatility inherent in the crypto market, especially when large volumes of tokens are unexpectedly sold off. This event undoubtedly created significant concern and losses for many UXLINK holders. The sudden influx of tokens onto the market, coupled with the nature of a suspected hack, often triggers panic selling. This reaction can exacerbate price declines, leading to a cascade effect across trading platforms. The Broader Implications: How the UXLink Hacker Incident Affects Trust Beyond the immediate financial losses, incidents like the UXLink hacker ‘s token swap carry broader implications for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. They erode investor trust, particularly in newer or less established projects. When security vulnerabilities are exploited, it raises questions about the robustness of a project’s infrastructure and its ability to protect user assets. Decentralized exchanges, while offering freedom and anonymity, also present unique challenges. Their open nature can sometimes make them attractive targets for malicious actors seeking to quickly liquidate stolen assets without extensive KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures. This event serves as a crucial reminder that while DeFi promises innovation, it also demands constant vigilance and robust security measures from both project developers and individual users. The collective confidence in the market relies heavily on the perceived safety of digital assets. Navigating Crypto Security in the Wake of the UXLink Hacker For individuals involved in cryptocurrency, incidents like the UXLink hacker ‘s activities highlight the critical importance of security. While no system is entirely immune to threats, several practices can help mitigate risks: Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all your funds into a single asset, especially those with smaller market caps or newer projects. Stay Informed: Regularly monitor news and updates from projects you invest in. Be aware of any security advisories or suspicious activities. Use Strong Security Practices: Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all your exchange accounts. Consider hardware wallets for storing significant amounts of cryptocurrency offline. Be Skeptical of Unsolicited Offers: Phishing scams and fraudulent links are common. Always double-check URLs and sender identities before clicking. Understand the Risks: Acknowledge that the crypto market is inherently volatile and carries risks, including potential hacks and exploits. These steps are not foolproof but can significantly enhance your personal security posture in the dynamic world of digital assets. Conclusion The incident involving the UXLink hacker and the subsequent sale of 2.5 billion tokens for $28.1 million in ETH is a sobering reminder of the challenges within the crypto space. It underscores the ongoing battle between innovation and security, and the need for continuous improvement in safeguarding digital assets. While the market has shown resilience over time, each such event serves as a crucial lesson, urging both projects and investors to prioritize robust security measures and informed decision-making. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly happened with the UXLink tokens? A: A suspected UXLink hacker sold approximately 2.49 billion UXLINK tokens, converting them into 6,732 ETH (worth $28.1 million) across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs), as reported by Lookonchain. Q2: How did this affect the UXLINK token price? A: The UXLINK token experienced a sharp decline, dropping by 80.09% and trading at $0.1109 following the hacker’s sell-off, according to CoinMarketCap data. Q3: What are decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and why were they used? A: DEXs are cryptocurrency exchanges that operate without a central authority, allowing users to trade directly peer-to-peer. They were likely used by the UXLink hacker for their speed, liquidity, and often less stringent identity verification processes, which can facilitate quick liquidation of assets. Q4: How can investors protect themselves from similar incidents? A: Investors can protect themselves by diversifying portfolios, staying informed about project security, using strong passwords and two-factor authentication, considering hardware wallets for cold storage, and being wary of phishing attempts and suspicious links. Q5: Does this incident mean all cryptocurrencies are unsafe? A: No, this incident highlights specific vulnerabilities that can exist within projects or platforms. While no investment is without risk, established cryptocurrencies and platforms often have more robust security measures. It emphasizes the importance of due diligence and understanding the risks associated with individual projects. If you found this article insightful, please consider sharing it with your network!

MACD and RSI show weakening momentum, with bears still controlling the daily trend. Open interest on XLM futures has decreased after a sharp spike last month. XLM Holds Near Key $0.35 Level Stellar (XLM) is trading at $0.36 after falling 7% in the past 24 hours. Over the last week, the asset has declined by 5%. The current price sits just above a key support zone at $0.35, a level that has previously shown strong buying interest. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the recent dip was not unexpected. He stated , “Stellar $XLM dipped to $0.35 as expected. If this level holds, consolidation toward the triangle’s apex could set up a breakout to $0.50.” The $0.35 area remains an important zone for traders watching for a shift in trend. Notably, the 12-hour chart shows a descending triangle formation, which has been developing over the last several weeks. XLM is now near the lower support boundary of this pattern. The price has respected this range before, making the current level a key point to watch. Source: Ali Martinez/X If the support holds, the pattern suggests that the price could begin to coil within the triangle. This setup may lead to a breakout above the descending trendline. Based on Fibonacci retracement levels, the next resistance areas are near $0.4, $0.42, and $0.44. If the breakout plays out fully, XLM could reach $0.50. A break below $0.35, however, may push the asset lower to the $0.34–$0.33 range. Indicators Show Weak Momentum On the daily chart, the MACD shows bearish signs. The MACD line is below the signal line, and both remain in negative territory. The histogram bars are red and widening, which reflects growing selling pressure. The RSI is now at 39, below the mid-point of 50. This reading confirms that current momentum favors sellers. While not in oversold territory yet, the RSI is approaching levels where buyers have stepped in before. Source: TradingView Data from Coinglass shows that XLM futures open interest surged in late October and early November, peaking above $500 million during a strong price move toward $0.60. Since then, open interest has declined along with price, returning to more moderate levels. Source: Coinglass Meanwhile, the drop in open interest may reflect reduced activity from leveraged positions. This type of cooling off often follows periods of heightened speculation and can be a sign that traders are waiting for a clearer direction.

A significant development on the horizon involves the WLFI DeFi project , a venture associated with the Trump family, which is preparing to introduce a groundbreaking debit card and a consumer application. This move could redefine how users interact with their digital funds, making crypto-adjacent payments more accessible than ever before. What is the WLFI DeFi Project Bringing to the Table? The core of this exciting announcement centers around the planned launch of a debit card by World Liberty Financial (WLFI). This isn’t just any debit card; it’s designed to integrate seamlessly into everyday financial transactions. The Block recently reported on these plans, highlighting the potential impact of such a product. Here are the key features expected from the WLFI DeFi project ‘s debit card: USD1 Payment Support: The card will facilitate payments in USD1, simplifying transactions for users who prefer stable, fiat-pegged digital currencies. This removes the volatility often associated with other cryptocurrencies. Apple Pay Compatibility: A major step towards mainstream adoption, the debit card is slated to be compatible with Apple Pay. This integration means users can make payments conveniently using their Apple devices, just like with traditional bank cards. This initiative from the WLFI DeFi project aims to make digital asset usage feel as intuitive and widespread as conventional payment methods.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Suggests Investors Now Fearful The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Falls Below $113,000, But This Indicator Says It’s Time To Buy The index uses the data of the following five factors to determine the investor mentality: volatility, trading volume, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. It then represents the calculated sentiment as a score lying between zero and hundred. All values above 53 correspond to a net sentiment of greed, while those under 47 imply the presence of fear in the market. A value between these two thresholds naturally corresponds to a neutral mentality. Now, here is how the sentiment among Bitcoin traders is currently like, according to the Fear & Greed Index: As is visible above, the index has a value of 45 at the moment, indicating that the investors are fearful, although only to a slight degree. The fear value is a new shift for the market, with this being the first time since September 7th that the metric has dipped into the zone. The worsening of sentiment is a result of the bearish price action that Bitcoin and other digital assets have faced recently, with prices across the sector observing a particularly sharp drop during the last 24 hours. The turn to fear, however, may actually not be a bad sign for the market, if the past is anything to go by. Historically, BTC and company have tended to move in the direction that goes contrary to the expectations of the crowd. The probability of such an opposite move occurring generally only goes up the more sure the traders become of a direction. On the Fear & Greed Index, there are two regions where this likelihood becomes the strongest: extreme fear (below 25) and extreme greed (above 75). The former is where major bottoms have occurred in the past, while the latter has facilitated top formations. While the investor sentiment is currently far from turning into extreme fear, the fact that investors are no longer greedy could still be a positive for the bull run’s hopes. It only remains to be seen, though, how things would play out for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready To Bark Again?

52131008,586796,1758603606,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52131008.jpeg,US And UK Announce Partnership For New Crypto Regulatory Framework,https://bitcoinist.com/us-and-uk-announce-partnership-new-crypto-framework/,"The United States and the United Kingdom have announced the formation of a “task force for markets of the future,” aimed to enhance cooperation on capital markets and crypto regulation. UK And US Unite To Tackle Crypto Market Challenges The agreement was reached during talks in Downing Street between UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, just ahead of President Donald Trump’s state visit to Britain. While the announcement came with limited specifics regarding the focus areas of the task force, it underscores a mutual interest in fostering collaboration in the growing digital asset market. The backdrop for this initiative is particularly relevant, as the UK has been grappling with a prolonged downturn in its capital markets. Many companies have opted to relocate their listings from London to New York, attracted by the promise of higher valuations and a more favorable regulatory environment. Meanwhile, the US has actively embraced the cryptocurrency industry under the current Trump administration, appointing crypto-friendly regulators, dismissing lawsuits against major players, and enacting landmark legislation governing stablecoins . In contrast, the UK has faced criticism from crypto executives for its slow regulatory response, which has left it trailing behind the US and other competitive financial hubs. The UK Treasury has indicated that the new task force will explore options for both short- and medium-term collaboration on digital assets while regulatory frameworks are still being developed. Additionally, the group will aim to streamline the process for UK and US firms seeking to raise capital across borders. Collaboration For Change Chaired by officials from both the UK and US Treasury departments, the task force is expected to include regulators responsible for overseeing capital markets and crypto assets on both sides of the Atlantic. It is tasked with reporting back within 180 days with recommendations on how best to proceed. Former Conservative Chancellor George Osborne has been vocal about the challenges facing the UK in the crypto space, warning that the country risks becoming irrelevant amid a financial revolution reminiscent of the “Big Bang” era of the 1980s. Osborne, who currently serves on the global advisory council of US-based crypto exchange Coinbase , has criticized the current government’s approach, suggesting that it is leaving the UK lagging behind. The UK Crypto asset Business Council, a trade organization, welcomed the announcement of the task force, viewing it as a strong endorsement from the US of the UK economy. They emphasized that if executed correctly, this initiative has the potential to invigorate the City of London and strengthen the transatlantic economy.

The country has signed off on 10 new chip projects, hoping to build everything from scratch (chip design, fabrication, testing, and packaging) even though it currently has no real chip industry. The investment is part of India’s “Semiconductor Mission,” for building a local supply chain and cutting dependence on foreign chips, which began after the U.S. blocked exports of high-end AI chips to China in 2022, starting a global race to control semiconductor production. India is one of the world’s biggest electronics buyers, but it’s barely on the map when it comes to making chips. Now, with $18.2 billion committed and two fabrication plants already approved, the government wants to change that. It also greenlit several testing and packaging plants. The idea is to create an end-to-end chip ecosystem right at home. Stephen Ezell, who serves as vice president for global innovation policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said chipmakers don’t just show up for incentives. “India needs more than a few fabs or ATP facilities – more than a few shiny objects,” he said. He also pointed out that manufacturers weigh up to 500 different things before spending billions (tax policy, labor rules, tech infrastructure, customs regulations) and India still has gaps to fix. Government launches electronic component support In May, the Indian government rolled out a new plan to support companies that make electronic parts. Until now, there wasn’t much local demand for chips because India barely made parts like camera modules or screens. This new policy offers cash support to companies making both active and passive components. That creates local customers who can actually use the chips India wants to make. Back in 2022, India tried focusing only on advanced chip nodes, 28 nanometers and below, hoping to lure fabs that could serve next-gen markets like AI and quantum computing. But that didn’t help much. So now, the government funds 50% of the costs for any chip project, no matter the node size, and also supports packaging and testing. Companies from Taiwan, the U.K., South Korea, and the U.S. are showing interest. “The Indian government has doled out generous incentives to attract semiconductor manufacturers to India,” said Stephen, though he made it clear those handouts can’t last forever. Right now, India’s biggest chip project is being built in Gujarat by Tata Electronics in partnership with Powerchip Semiconductor from Taiwan. It’s worth 910 billion rupees ($11 billion). Tata says the facility will make chips used in AI, cars, computers, and data storage, things like power management ICs, display drivers, and microcontrollers. In Odisha, U.K.-based Clas-SiC Wafer Fab is teaming up with SiCSem to set up India’s first commercial compound semiconductor plant. The chips made there will be used in solar inverters, electric cars, defense systems, and home appliances, according to the Indian government. India focuses on fabrication and packaging expansion Sujay Shetty, managing director of semiconductors at PwC India, said the next 3–4 years are critical. He believes India’s real milestone will be getting fabrication plants operational and overcoming logistical barriers. Sujay said fabs need specific sites, places without earthquakes, floods, or road access problems. They also need ultra-pure chemicals, which India doesn’t yet supply. Meanwhile, local interest in chip testing and packaging is growing. These segments are cheaper to enter than fabs and offer better profit margins. Mid-sized companies in India are jumping in. So are domestic firms. But India’s still nowhere close to producing cutting-edge chips like the 2nm ones. Taiwan Semiconductor will begin mass-producing 2nm chips later this year. Meanwhile, India’s involvement is limited. Last week, Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw opened ARM’s new office in Bengaluru. ARM plans to design 2nm AI chips there for drones, phones, and servers. But the real chip architecture will still be done in places like the U.S. or Singapore, where intellectual property is better protected. Jayanth BR, a semiconductor recruiter with over 15 years of experience in India, said the country has had chip design talent since the 1990s. But companies only give India “block-level” design validation. The core design work stays overseas. Sajai Singh, a partner at JSA Advocates & Solicitors in Mumbai, said India’s intellectual property laws need work. He said the country must improve enforcement and update laws for software and digital content. “Our competition is with countries like the U.S., Europe, and Taiwan, which not only have strong IP laws, but also a more established ecosystem for chip design,” he said.

Whale wallets sold 160 million ADA in four days, as the price slipped by 5% weekly to under $0.82. Cardano’s eUTXO model could attract long-term attention for its structured transaction execution. ADA Nears Key Resistance in Ascending Triangle Cardano (ADA) is trading at around $0.82 after a 7% drop since Monday. The past week shows a decline of just over 5%. On the daily chart, the price continues to form an ascending triangle, a structure often watched for trend continuation. Notably, the triangle’s upper boundary sits near $0.95, a level that has held as resistance since mid-July. At the same time, a series of higher lows suggests increasing buying interest. Market tracker TapTools noted : “A breakout above $0.95 could open the path toward $1.20.” Bollinger Bands on the daily chart are narrowing, pointing to a period of low volatility. The Supertrend indicator remains below the price at $0.8089, showing no reversal at the time of writing. These conditions often come before price expansion, but confirmation is still needed. Source: TapTools/X If ADA closes above $0.95, the next area to monitor would be around $1.05 to $1.20. However, a failure to break resistance may lead to a drop toward the trendline near $0.80. A breakdown below that area could open the way toward $0.72 to $0.75, a previous support zone. Whale Selling Adds Pressure Around Current Levels According to Ali Martinez, large holders moved approximately 160 million ADA over the past four days. These addresses hold between 1 million and 10 million ADA each. Their total balance fell from 5.6 billion to 5.44 billion. 160 million Cardano $ADA sold by whales in the last 96 hours! pic.twitter.com/gpmdXLT65k — Ali (@ali_charts) September 21, 2025 Despite the size of the move, the price has mostly held steady, suggesting that buying interest has so far met the supply. Recently, similar selling activity saw another 530 million ADA moved over 2 days. Separately, Cardano supporter and content creator David shared a post pointing to the blockchain’s eUTXO ledger model as a reason it may gain more attention over time. He suggested that this structure allows for more predictable execution compared to account-based systems and could help ADA stand out in the future.

Leading financial institutions are making significant moves into the digital asset space, particularly focusing on stablecoins and asset tokenization. This strategic pivot signals a new era for finance, blending traditional banking with cutting-edge blockchain technology. For anyone watching the cryptocurrency market, this development is a clear indicator of mainstream adoption gaining serious momentum. What Are South Korean Giants Planning with Stablecoins? During the recent Korea Blockchain Week 2025, top officials from South Korea’s most prominent financial groups, including Shinhan Bank, KB Financial Group, Woori Bank, and Hana Financial Group, made groundbreaking announcements. They revealed their active preparations to launch businesses centered around won-denominated stablecoins and the tokenization of various assets. This isn’t just a casual interest; it represents a deep dive into how digital assets can reshape their core operations. These financial behemoths are not merely observing; they are actively reviewing digital assets as a pivotal new business line. The consensus among the panelists was clear: the cryptocurrency industry is no longer a niche market. As regulatory frameworks mature and policies become clearer, it presents a significant and undeniable opportunity for the established financial sector. Unlocking New Opportunities: Why Stablecoins Matter Now The push for won-denominated stablecoins by such influential players highlights several potential benefits. Firstly, these digital currencies can facilitate faster, cheaper, and more efficient transactions, both domestically and internationally. Imagine seamless cross-border payments without the traditional delays and fees. Secondly, they offer a bridge between the traditional financial system and the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, opening up new avenues for investment and liquidity. Moreover, asset tokenization allows for the fractional ownership of high-value assets like real estate, art, or commodities. This process democratizes access to investments previously exclusive to a wealthy few. It creates new markets and enhances liquidity for illiquid assets, potentially revolutionizing how value is exchanged and managed within the economy. Enhanced Efficiency: Streamlined transactions and reduced costs. Broader Access: Democratizing investment opportunities through fractional ownership. Market Expansion: Creating new liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets. Regulatory Clarity: Growing confidence due to evolving policies. Navigating the Hurdles: Challenges for Won-Denominated Stablecoins While the enthusiasm is palpable, the journey isn’t without its obstacles. The financial leaders openly acknowledged the challenges ahead. A primary concern revolves around the lack of clear accounting standards specifically for won-denominated stablecoins . Establishing these standards is crucial for transparency, regulatory compliance, and investor confidence. Without well-defined accounting rules, integrating these digital assets into existing financial reporting systems becomes complex. This uncertainty can hinder widespread adoption and create regulatory ambiguities. Addressing this will require close collaboration between financial institutions, regulators, and accounting bodies to forge a robust and adaptable framework. The path forward demands careful consideration of: Regulatory Harmonization: Aligning national and international digital asset regulations. Technological Infrastructure: Ensuring secure and scalable blockchain solutions. Consumer Protection: Safeguarding users in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. Interoperability: Ensuring different stablecoin projects can communicate effectively. The Future is Digital: South Korea’s Vision for Stablecoins and Tokenization The commitment from South Korea’s financial giants to explore stablecoins and asset tokenization is a strong signal of the financial sector’s evolving perspective on digital assets. It moves beyond speculative trading to embrace the underlying technology for practical, transformative business applications. As regulations continue to mature, the groundwork is being laid for a financial system that is more integrated, efficient, and accessible than ever before. This strategic shift could position South Korea as a global leader in digital finance innovation. The lessons learned and frameworks developed here could very well set precedents for other nations grappling with how to integrate blockchain technology into their traditional financial systems. It’s an exciting time to witness this convergence of established finance and disruptive technology. In conclusion, South Korean financial giants are not just dabbling in digital assets; they are strategically positioning themselves at the forefront of a financial revolution. Their focus on won-denominated stablecoins and asset tokenization, while facing challenges like accounting standards, underscores a profound belief in the future of digital finance. This proactive approach promises to redefine banking and investment, offering unprecedented opportunities for growth and innovation in the global economy.

The block revealed that WLFI’s co-founder, Zak Folkman, shared the news during a fireside conversation during Tuesday’s Korea Blockchain Week in Seoul.

Commenting on the soon-to-debut card, Folkman said: This allows users to be able to attach their USD1 and their World Liberty Financial app right into their Apple Pay. Not today, but it’s coming very soon. Individuals can use the debit card to spend World Liberty’s stablecoin, USD1, at all joints that accept Apple Pay. The move is part of the growing Web3 trend to make digital tokens spendable in day-to-day dealings. WLFI’s retail app: “Venmo meets Robinhood” Folkman confirmed plans to launch an innovative retail application, which he describes as Venmo meets Robinhood. The app will adopt user-friendliness, allowing individuals to complete P2P payments with an interactive interface for streamlined asset buying and selling. With trading and payment offerings, World Liberty signals plans to expand beyond a crypto project into a complete financial lifestyle powerhouse. These two features could help bridge cryptocurrency and traditional finance. Also, it is crucial in promoting digital asset adoption through daily spending. Folkman also clarified that the DeFi project has no plans to launch a chain, emphasizing: We believe that our job is not to roll out chains or exchanges or anything like that, but to be completely agnostic when it comes to chains, technology, distribution platforms. WLFI price outlook World Liberty’s native token has underperformed since its official debut on September 1. It plunged from above $0.30 to $0.2039 at press time. Chart by Coinmarketcap WLFI has lost more than 12% in the past 24 hours due to the ongoing market bloodbath . Meanwhile, the team has adopted various strategies to enhance WLFi’s tokenomics, including plans to burn all liquidity fees . Folkman acknowledged that broader market conditions will continue to influence WLFI performance. Nonetheless, the co-founder emphasized focus on long-term value and not short-term price movements. We’re not in this to run a sprint, this truly is a marathon. World Liberty Financial is not thinking in terms of months or even years. We’re thinking in terms of decades and how we can build products that have staying power. Indeed, WLFI is poised for significant use cases that will drive its growth in the years to come. A combined trading-payments app and spending USD1 through Apple Pay could attract more individuals to hold and use the altcoin. Increased use cases often boost demand, which supports stable price actions with soaring adoption.

A key advisor has just revealed a groundbreaking objective for the U.S. crypto committee: establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . This isn’t just another policy idea; it signals a profound shift in how the nation views digital assets, potentially positioning Bitcoin as a vital component of future economic and national security strategies. For anyone invested in the future of digital finance, this development is nothing short of fascinating. Unpacking the Vision: What is a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? At the recent KBW 2025 event, officials from the White House Crypto Advisory Committee laid out their ambitious agenda. Among the four primary policy goals, the pursuit of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the United States stood out. But what does this concept truly entail for the nation? A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve would involve the U.S. government acquiring and holding a significant amount of Bitcoin. Much like holding gold or foreign currencies, this reserve could serve as a hedge against economic instability or a tool for geopolitical influence. It reflects a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s potential as a global, decentralized asset, adding a new dimension to national treasury management and financial resilience. Executive Director Patrick Witt and Deputy Director Harry Jung, speaking at the event, highlighted this initiative as a cornerstone of their long-term vision. This move could redefine the U.S.’s stance on digital currency, moving beyond mere regulation to active strategic engagement in the crypto space. Beyond Bitcoin: The Committee’s Broader Crypto Agenda While the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve captures significant attention, it’s part of a larger, comprehensive strategy. The committee outlined several other crucial objectives aimed at fostering a robust and secure digital asset ecosystem: Accelerating Digital Asset Legislation: Pushing for clear, comprehensive laws that provide regulatory certainty for the crypto industry. This aims to move past piecemeal approaches and create a stable environment for innovation. Clarifying Cryptocurrency Tax Regulations: Simplifying and making transparent the tax rules around digital assets. This is vital for both individual investors and businesses to operate with confidence and compliance. Protecting Crypto Technology Developers’ Rights: Ensuring that the creators and innovators in the crypto space are safeguarded, encouraging continued development and breakthroughs without undue legal burdens. These goals collectively demonstrate a proactive approach to integrating digital assets into the national framework. The committee is actively coordinating with major government bodies, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Department of Commerce, and the Department of the Treasury, to advance this expansive crypto policy agenda effectively. Securing the Future: Can Crypto Policy Endure Political Shifts? A natural question arises: what about potential policy changes after an election? Witt and Jung addressed this concern directly, emphasizing the deliberate and robust nature of their current efforts. They explained that establishing a strong legislative and regulatory framework now would create a formidable foundation. This strategic approach is designed to make it exceedingly difficult for any future administration to simply reverse the established direction. By embedding digital assets into law and coordinating across multiple agencies, the committee aims to build a resilient and enduring policy structure. This commitment to long-term stability provides a degree of assurance for the crypto community, signaling that the U.S. is serious about its digital asset future, including the potential for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . The journey to realize these ambitious goals, particularly the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , will undoubtedly involve challenges. These may include navigating complex international relations, addressing concerns about energy consumption, and ensuring robust security protocols for managing such a valuable national asset. However, the potential benefits—from enhanced financial resilience to solidified technological leadership—are clearly driving this forward-thinking initiative. A Glimpse into Tomorrow: What Does This Mean for You? The White House’s focus on a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and broader crypto legislation signifies a pivotal moment. For investors, it suggests increasing institutional legitimacy and potentially greater market stability. For developers, it promises a clearer regulatory landscape, fostering innovation. For the general public, it points towards a future where digital assets play a more integrated role in the national economy. This proactive stance by the U.S. government, spearheaded by the Crypto Advisory Committee, is a powerful indicator of the growing mainstream acceptance and strategic importance of cryptocurrencies. It’s a bold step towards securing a digital future, with Bitcoin potentially at its very core.

The first key level is $112,000, identified by Swissblock Technologies. “As long as $112,000 holds and the Risk stays stable, BTC can rebuild strength,” Swissblock noted on X. The firm’s proprietary Bitcoin Risk Index aggregates on-chain valuation and cost-basis data to gauge market volatility—rising readings indicate risk aversion and potential price swings, while low or stable levels suggest bullish sentiment. On Monday, the risk index hovered near zero, signaling optimism despite BTC’s 1.7% drop to $112,600 in the past 24 hours, with prices briefly dipping as low as $111,717, according to CoinDesk data . Swissblock also highlighted $110,000 as a “lifeline support.” Historical charts reveal that in the December-January period, buyers struggled to hold BTC above this level, marking it as a significant zone to monitor. The third crucial support is the on-chain metric known as the “short-term holder cost basis,” currently at $111,400. Analytics firm Glassnode defines this as the average purchase price for wallets that have acquired bitcoin within the last 155 days. This indicator is widely regarded as a battleground between bulls and bears—prices above it generally reflect bullish conviction. In contrast, sustained trading below it could signal increased risk of sell-offs or a shift toward a bearish market structure. “Sustained trading below this level could signal a shift toward a mid- to long-term bearish market structure,” Glassnode explained on X. Together, these three levels – $110,000, $111,400, and $112,000 – form a delicate support zone that traders are closely watching as bitcoin navigates this volatile phase.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-23 05:15:31

While hype drives many alts, the real winners have utility and growth. Right now, Polkadot, Chainlink, Polygon, and a rising contender — Layer Brett — stand out as strong candidates for breakout rallies. Layer Brett: the top crypto to buy now Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is drawing major attention as a presale hit that mixes meme-coin energy with real blockchain utility. As an Ethereum Layer-2, it delivers faster, cheaper transactions while offering staking rewards, capped supply, and governance features. Its roadmap includes NFT integrations and cross-chain bridges, making it more than just hype. Momentum is building fast. The presale has already raised over $3.9 million , with tokens priced near $0.0058. Wallet sign-ups and community traction are accelerating, while social presence is expanding rapidly. Staking rewards of +660% , limited 10B supply, and a $1M community giveaway add powerful catalysts, positioning Layer Brett as a speculative yet fundamentally strong play. The capped token supply ensures long-term scarcity and price appreciation as demand rises, while staking rewards encourage holders not to dump at launch. Its meme-driven branding fuels community growth, while the Layer-2 infrastructure gives it a clear use case. This dual appeal — hype plus hard fundamentals — is why experts are calling it one of the best new cryptos to buy in 2025! Polkadot: Bullish on scarcity & upgrades Polkadot is capped at 2.1 billion , reducing future inflation and sparking accumulation. Its 2.0 upgrade introduced elastic scaling, better cross-chain messaging, and JAM protocol improvements. These updates not only make the network faster but also more attractive to developers building multichain apps. Adoption is showing in the numbers: new wallet addresses and parachain activity are climbing steadily, and institutional holders are beginning to accumulate DOT as a long-term scarcity play. With its combination of supply tightening and technical strength, Polkadot looks set to command greater investor confidence going into the next cycle. Chainlink: Oracle leader regaining momentum Chainlink (LINK) remains DeFi’s backbone, connecting smart contracts to real-world data. Recent charts show LINK bouncing from oversold zones, with liquidity sweeps pointing to renewed strength. Exchange outflows also reduce circulating supply, signaling investor confidence. What gives LINK an edge is its breadth: from DeFi lending protocols to insurance, NFTs, and even real-world asset tokenization, Chainlink’s oracles power critical infrastructure across Web3. As more institutions experiment with blockchain, LINK’s ability to deliver trusted data becomes essential. That utility, combined with improving technical signals, makes Chainlink one of the strongest infrastructure tokens to hold now. Polygon: scaling Ethereum’s vision Polygon (POL) has cemented itself as Ethereum’s top scaling ecosystem, powering faster, cheaper apps through PoS, zkEVM, and modular tools. A recent partnership with Cypher Capital expands institutional access, especially in the Middle East. Rising TVL, growing daily transactions, and upgrades like POL migration and AggLayer reinforce Polygon’s role as a core Ethereum scaling play. Crucially, Polygon isn’t just about scaling transactions — it’s building the foundation for Web3 adoption. Brands like Starbucks, Adidas, and Reddit already use Polygon for NFTs and loyalty systems. This enterprise traction, alongside developer adoption, shows that Polygon is becoming the go-to gateway for mainstream businesses entering blockchain. Conclusion A smart crypto portfolio should blend proven networks with emerging stars. Polkadot brings scarcity and fresh upgrades, Polygon drives Ethereum scaling, and Chainlink powers Web3 data. Meanwhile, Layer Brett offers a high-risk, high-reward presale with real fundamentals, spurring market pundits to hail LBRETT as the best crypto to buy now for massive gains!

For anyone holding or trading INJ, understanding this development is key to navigating the crypto landscape. What’s Behind the Injective (INJ) Suspension? The temporary Injective (INJ) suspension by Bithumb is not a cause for alarm; rather, it’s a standard procedure in the dynamic world of blockchain technology.

Mainnet upgrades are vital for any blockchain, bringing about improvements in performance, security, and the introduction of new features.

Injective is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol built on Cosmos, specializing in derivatives, margin trading, and futures. Its mainnet upgrades are not just routine; they are fundamental to its evolution. These enhancements often lead to: Increased network efficiency: Expect faster transaction processing and potentially lower fees. Enhanced security features: Protecting user funds and data more robustly against emerging threats. New functionalities: Expanding the capabilities of the Injective ecosystem, which could mean more trading options or improved user experience. Ultimately, such upgrades strengthen the underlying technology of Injective (INJ) , fostering a more robust and scalable platform for decentralized finance. This commitment to improvement benefits all users in the long run. What Does This Injective (INJ) Suspension Mean for Traders and Investors?

Starting September 25th at 5:00 a.m. UTC, you will temporarily be unable to deposit or withdraw Injective (INJ) from the exchange. However, it’s crucial to note that typically, trading of INJ on Bithumb will continue uninterrupted during these periods. This means you can still buy, sell, and trade your INJ tokens within the exchange. The suspension is purely for external transfers, not for internal market activity. Actionable Insight: If you need to deposit or withdraw INJ from Bithumb, make sure to complete these transactions well before the announced deadline. Planning ahead can save you from any inconvenience or missed opportunities. Navigating Temporary Service Pauses: Best Practices for Injective (INJ) Holders While temporary suspensions like this Injective (INJ) suspension are common, knowing how to react is vital.

Their websites and social media channels are the most reliable sources for real-time updates. Plan Your Transactions: If you anticipate needing to move your INJ, do so before the suspension begins. Set reminders if necessary to avoid last-minute rushes. Understand the Duration: While Bithumb announced a temporary suspension, keep an eye out for updates regarding the exact duration and when services will resume. Secure Your Assets: Your INJ tokens held on Bithumb remain secure during the suspension. The exchange takes these measures precisely to protect your assets during upgrades and maintenance. The temporary Injective (INJ) suspension on Bithumb for deposits and withdrawals, driven by a mainnet upgrade, is a testament to the continuous evolution of the blockchain space. While it requires a minor adjustment for users, these upgrades are ultimately beneficial, paving the way for a more efficient, secure, and feature-rich Injective protocol. Staying informed and planning ahead ensures a smooth experience for all INJ holders in this rapidly advancing ecosystem.

52132445,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=816178,1758605438,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52132445.jpeg,Nvidia and OpenAI signed a $100B deal to build data centers and buy OpenAI equity,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nvidia-openai-good-theater-for-the-algo/,"Nvidia and OpenAI signed a $100 billion agreement on Monday that sounds more like a handshake tailored for algo-driven markets than an actual business necessity. The setup is that Nvidia will sell chips to OpenAI for giant data centers. In return, it’ll spend $100 billion buying OpenAI’s unlisted stock over time, far more than the $72 billion OpenAI has raised in its ten-year history. Both companies claim this move will help accelerate AI development, but the scale of the deal and the way it was announced made it feel more like financial performance art than a genuine requirement. On paper, this arrangement locks Nvidia into supplying chips for AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-5, which are set to run on a new wave of infrastructure. But then comes the odd part; Nvidia doesn’t need to do this. The company is already the top supplier of advanced AI chips, and its closest competitors are still struggling to catch up. Even OpenAI has been trying to develop its own chips, but for now, it’s still heavily dependent on Nvidia. Nvidia invests $100B and builds 10GW data centers for OpenAI The deal includes the construction of data centers powered by Nvidia chips with a minimum capacity of 10 gigawatts. These aren’t just for testing. They’ll train and deploy real AI models. And while Nvidia will provide the hardware, it’s also going to be an investor, piling in $100 billion over time to increase its existing stake in OpenAI. This equity-based structure means OpenAI won’t owe anything back. If the value drops, or chip orders don’t follow through, Nvidia absorbs the loss. Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, isn’t betting the company. With about $100 billion in yearly free cash flow and a $4.5 trillion valuation, he can take a hit. But the real question is why do it at all? Monday’s announcement bumped Nvidia’s market cap by $180 billion. Not a bad day in the markets, but a small gain for a company that size. Sam Altman’s side of the story is clearer. OpenAI is expected to generate $12 billion in revenue this year, but it can’t cover the massive capital expenses needed to stay ahead. For a company claiming to lead the AI race, raising money in chunks should be easy. Still, the whole thing reeks of performance. OpenAI wants to look unstoppable in the race toward superintelligence. Its $500 billion valuation depends on that belief. Big data center plans create momentum. For Nvidia, being seen as the go-to AI chip supplier forces rivals to panic-buy before it’s too late. Nvidia calms partners as competitors rethink chip strategy Right after the news broke, Nvidia tried to calm the rest of its customer base. “Our investments will not change our focus or impact supply to our other customers,” the company said in a statement. “We will continue to make every customer a top priority, with or without any equity stake.” That statement was clearly aimed at companies like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet; all of whom Nvidia still heavily depends on for revenue. These firms are racing to build AI infrastructure too. Many are developing their own chips to reduce reliance on Nvidia, but they’re still buying from Jensen’s team in the meantime. Now, those same companies are watching the OpenAI–Nvidia relationship closely. If Nvidia is seen as giving OpenAI special access, competitors may push harder to go independent. The fear of falling down the priority list could push them to speed up internal chip development or look more seriously at Nvidia alternatives like AMD.

The number of monthly stablecoin senders just climbed to 25.2 million, the highest ever recorded, according to data from Token Terminal. So far in 2025, startups working on stablecoin projects have pulled in $621.81 million in funding. That’s not a typo. It’s seven times more than the $84 million raised in all of 2024. The biggest single deal came from OSL Group, a firm based in Hong Kong that locked in $300 million back in July. That capital’s going straight into expanding operations across global markets. Source: Token Terminal Trump signs GENIUS Act, firms move fast Behind this wave of funding is one thing: regulation. President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act earlier this year. The law gave the stablecoin industry the clarity it’s been begging for. Ron Tarter, CEO of MNEE, called it a “green light for corporate America, legitimizing the industry.” And Wall Street is listening. The total capitalization of all stablecoins has now passed $297 billion, a new peak. At Coinbase, analysts are betting that the market will shoot up to $1 trillion by 2028. Circle, the firm behind USDC, held its initial public offering in June and raised $1 billion in the process. Its shares are trading at $144 right now. When combined with fundraising by Figure Technologies and other centralized and RWA-focused entities, total investment in the space has crossed $2.4 billion this year. Traditional finance isn’t sitting still. Payments giant Stripe is building its own stablecoin. So are Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America. Meanwhile, Societe Generale’s crypto division, SG-FORGE, launched a token called USDCV. Over at JPMorgan, executives confirmed the release of their JPMD coin, built on the Base blockchain. Coinbase battles banks as new products roll out Not everyone is happy. Banking lobby groups are pissed. They argue the GENIUS Act puts banks at a disadvantage because stablecoin firms can offer interest-like perks. Banks can’t do that without extra restrictions. And that difference, they claim, could pull over $6 trillion out of traditional bank deposits. Coinbase isn’t having it. Faryar Shirzad, the exchange’s policy chief, said the banks just want to keep their $187 billion annual cut from transaction fees. He called their warning a “myth.” Tensions boiled over this week as Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, and other crypto execs headed to Capitol Hill. Banks want lawmakers to stop platforms like Coinbase from offering customers high-yield rewards. Brian wasn’t amused. “They should have to compete on a level playing field in crypto,” he told said on Wednesday, as Cryptopolitan reported. Right now, Coinbase gives 4.1% on USDC holdings. Kraken offers 5.5% on the same. That’s way above what banks are paying on savings. Meanwhile on Monday, the Plasma blockchain project, which is backed by Bitfinex, revealed Plasma One, a neobank built from scratch for stablecoin usage. The app includes zero-fee USDT transfers, card payments with built-in rewards, and near-instant issuance of virtual cards. Plasma says early access will launch in stages, focusing on users in regions with weak access to U.S. dollars. Plasma’s goal is to be a full-stack platform for stablecoin users. Even with all the gains, there’s a problem: the front-end experience is messy. Murat Firat, Head of Product at Plasma, says that’s not enough. “Infrastructure alone is not enough,” he said, arguing that better interfaces are needed to drive daily adoption. Over at Standard Chartered, analysts said in July that clients were more interested in stablecoins than Bitcoin. In September, JPMorgan analysts warned that the wave of new tokens could lead to a brutal zero-sum race between issuers.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-exchange-your-bitcoin-for-xrp-if-you-havent-already-heres-why/,"Crypto proponent John Squire recently issued a clear statement urging investors to reconsider their Bitcoin positions. His message was direct: “Please exchange your #Bitcoin for XRP if you haven’t already.” In the tweet, he captioned a video of European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde addressing Bitcoin’s role in central bank reserves. By pairing his statement with Lagarde’s remarks, Squire highlighted what he views as the shortcomings of Bitcoin within the institutional finance ecosystem. Please exchange your #Bitcoin for #XRP if you haven’t already. pic.twitter.com/93CdPGKCOl — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) September 20, 2025 Lagarde’s Position on Bitcoin Reserves In the video, Lagarde explained the reasoning behind the ECB’s rejection of Bitcoin . She emphasized that reserves must be liquid, secure, and safe, and free from risks tied to money laundering or criminal activity. Lagarde added that she was confident Bitcoin would not be accepted as a reserve asset by either the Governing Council or the General Council of the ECB. She noted that conversations with European colleagues, including representatives from the Czech Republic, reinforced the commitment to maintaining strict standards for reserve assets. Her stance reflected a broader consensus within the ECB to exclude Bitcoin from official reserves. Implications for Crypto Investors Squire’s call to exchange Bitcoin for XRP reflected an ongoing debate within the crypto sector. Bitcoin, while the most recognized cryptocurrency, continues to face scrutiny from regulators and financial authorities who question its suitability as a reserve. XRP, by contrast, is frequently promoted by advocates as a digital asset designed with institutional utility in mind, especially for cross-border payments and liquidity management. By drawing attention to Lagarde’s comments, Squire highlighted the challenges Bitcoin faces in gaining acceptance from central banks, while presenting XRP as an alternative more aligned with institutional requirements. His stance positioned XRP as an asset with greater long-term compatibility with regulated financial systems.

A user identified as Matty M opposed Squire’s call, arguing that Bitcoin was created to break away from central banks and what they represent. This view reflects a belief in Bitcoin as a symbol of independence rather than a means of institutional integration. Another user, Lonely Rose, expressed support for holding both Bitcoin and XRP but stated they intended to increase their XRP holdings in anticipation of future growth. Their perspective reflected a strategy of diversification while favoring XRP’s potential gains. John Squire’s post, paired with Lagarde’s rejection of Bitcoin as a reserve asset, highlighted the ongoing divide in how digital assets are perceived. Squire framed XRP as a stronger option for those considering institutional alignment, while critics defended Bitcoin’s independence. Lagarde’s remarks reinforced the ECB’s resistance to Bitcoin, leaving open the question of whether assets like XRP could one day meet the criteria for inclusion in central bank reserves.

The analyst was not worried by short-term dips, identifying multiple nested chart patterns such as an inverse head-and-shoulders within another head-and-shoulders, all contained in a larger inverse head-and-shoulders formation inside a broadening wedge. They believe these patterns will cascade together to drive a major breakout and Bitcoin to $140,000 before the end of this year. Leverage to Blame Again “Right now, everyone is second-guessing if the bull run is over,” he said before adding that this is the “perfect sentiment” because it contrasts with euphoria, which would be a top signal. “The timing of this move also makes sense within the context of lengthening cycles and the fact that we haven’t seen a blow-off top yet. No metric or indicator I’m watching suggests a top is in.” I think we’re going to see a *MASSIVE* move up by Bitcoin soon.

What was once seen as an innovative approach to corporate finance is now reportedly showing critical signs of collapse, according to a recent Financial Times report. This shift marks a pivotal moment for businesses that embraced digital assets as a core part of their balance sheets. What’s Driving the Shift Away from Corporate Crypto Treasury? Initially, the idea of a Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) gained considerable traction, promising new avenues for growth and hedging against inflation. However, the landscape has changed dramatically. The primary driver behind this apparent reversal is the significant drop in the value of these crypto holdings, often falling below the companies’ average purchase prices. Instead of continuing to accumulate digital assets, many firms are now pivoting their financial strategies. The Financial Times highlighted that at least seven companies have recently initiated share buybacks. This move is a traditional method used to boost stock prices and return value to shareholders, starkly contrasting the earlier enthusiasm for token purchases under the corporate crypto treasury model. The Perils of a Digital Asset Treasury Strategy The report suggests that companies with substantial crypto reserves are not only struggling with falling asset values but are also becoming attractive acquisition targets. This indicates a broader re-evaluation of the DAT model’s sustainability. Consider the recent acquisition of Nasdaq-listed medical technology company Semler Scientific (SMLR) by U.S. asset manager Strive. Semler Scientific famously held 5,816 BTC, valued at an impressive $675 million, making it a prime example of a company with a significant corporate crypto treasury . This trend, where firms with large crypto holdings are being acquired, further signals a potential end to the widespread adoption of the DAT model. The publication also critically described many adopters of this strategy as: Shell companies with minimal or no operating profit. Firms whose stock prices were primarily driven by the fluctuating value of their token holdings rather than fundamental business performance. Such observations raise serious questions about the long-term viability and strategic rationale behind maintaining a substantial corporate crypto treasury without robust underlying operations. Expert Insights on the Future of Corporate Crypto Treasury The rapid rise and potential fall of this strategy have not gone unnoticed by industry experts. Elliot Chun, a partner at the crypto advisory firm Architect Partners, remarked that discussions about the model’s downfall are already prevalent, despite its popularity surging just six months prior. This rapid turnaround underscores the volatile and unpredictable nature of integrating digital assets into corporate finance. Chun’s prediction is clear: very few companies will ultimately succeed with the corporate crypto treasury strategy. He points out a significant shift in corporate behavior, where many of these firms are now actively raising funds for share buybacks instead of making further token purchases. This strategic pivot directly contradicts the foundational principles of the DAT strategy, highlighting a clear departure from earlier ambitions. Rethinking the Corporate Crypto Treasury: A New Era? The implications of this shift are profound. It suggests a growing realization among corporate leaders that relying heavily on volatile digital assets for stock valuation or treasury management carries substantial risks. The market appears to be distinguishing between companies with genuine operational profits and those whose valuations are primarily speculative, tied to crypto prices. For businesses considering or currently employing a corporate crypto treasury model, this serves as a crucial wake-up call. It emphasizes the need for a balanced approach, robust risk management, and a clear alignment between digital asset holdings and core business objectives. The era of simply accumulating crypto without a sustainable operational framework may indeed be drawing to a close, paving the way for more prudent and integrated strategies. In conclusion, the journey of the corporate crypto treasury model, from a trending innovation to a strategy showing signs of collapse, offers valuable lessons. It highlights the inherent volatility of the crypto market and the importance of fundamental business strength over speculative asset holdings. As companies re-evaluate their financial blueprints, the emphasis is shifting back towards strategies that ensure long-term stability and shareholder value through proven operational success, rather than solely through digital asset accumulation. The market is evolving, and with it, corporate financial strategies must adapt to navigate these complex waters effectively. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Digital Asset Treasury (DAT)? A Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) is a corporate strategy where companies hold significant reserves of cryptocurrency on their balance sheets, often as a treasury management or investment approach. Why are companies abandoning the corporate crypto treasury model? Companies are reportedly abandoning this model due to falling cryptocurrency values, which have often dropped below their average purchase prices, making the holdings less valuable. Many are pivoting to traditional share buybacks instead. What are share buybacks and why are companies using them? Share buybacks are when a company repurchases its own shares from the open market. Companies use them to reduce the number of outstanding shares, which can boost earnings per share and increase the stock price, signaling confidence to investors. What does the Semler Scientific acquisition signify for the DAT model? The acquisition of Semler Scientific, a company known for its substantial Bitcoin holdings, suggests that firms with large crypto treasuries might become attractive targets for acquisition, further signaling a re-evaluation of the DAT model’s standalone viability. Is the corporate crypto treasury model completely dead? While showing significant signs of collapse and facing expert skepticism, the model may not be entirely dead. However, its widespread adoption is likely to diminish, with a focus shifting towards more robust, operationally-backed strategies rather than speculative crypto holdings.

The analyst points to the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) aligning near $2.77, a level that could determine whether the asset sustains its broader bullish structure or faces short-term downside pressure. EGRAG notes that if XRP fails to hold above this zone, a retest of $2.65 becomes highly likely. While this scenario may not be what bullish investors want to hear, he emphasizes that $2.65 remains the most critical level in defining XRP’s next major move. “I know you might be tired of hearing me state $2.65,” EGRAG remarked , “but this level remains the most critical zone for our upcoming bull run.” XRP faces a critical juncture as it consolidates above $2.70. With RSI signaling neutrality, traders are focused on key moving averages, especially the 50 EMA, which has become a technical battleground as it converges with current price action. Notably, XRP’s bullish outlook hinges on holding above $2.77 and fending off a slide toward $2.65. Sustained strength here could fuel another push at the stubborn $3.20 barrier. A breakout above this level would clear the path for a $3.65 retest and potentially reignite the broader uptrend. Nevertheless, failure to hold $2.65 could erode investor confidence, hand control to the bears, and trigger deeper corrections, delaying hopes of a sustained bull run. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $2.87 per CoinGecko data . XRP Ledger Recognized as a Global Payment and Settlement System, Says Market Expert Pumpius According to market expert Pumpius, a recent statement published in the Federal Register has reaffirmed the significance of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), describing it as “a global real-time payment and settlement system.” This recognition underscores the growing role of XRPL in reshaping financial infrastructure and highlights its alignment with the future of cross-border payments. The Federal Register’s description is more than a technical note, it signals acknowledgment from an authoritative source that XRP’s underlying technology is not merely a digital asset ledger, but a comprehensive global settlement mechanism. Unlike traditional financial systems that rely on intermediaries and delayed processing, XRPL is designed for near-instantaneous transfers, low costs, and seamless interoperability across borders. The XRP Ledger’s strengths lie in its scalability and sustainability. Capable of handling 1,500 transactions per second with settlement times under five seconds, it has been engineered to outperform traditional systems like SWIFT, which can take days to process cross-border payments. Moreover, its consensus mechanism is energy-efficient, addressing growing concerns about blockchain’s environmental impact. Therefore, this recognition comes at a pivotal moment for XRP. With legal clarity secured and institutional interest rising, XRP is gaining traction as a bridge currency connecting global financial systems. As remittance flows approach $800 billion annually, the XRPL’s ability to cut costs and streamline cross-border payments offers a powerful value proposition for banks, payment providers, and enterprises. Conclusion The Federal Register’s recognition of the XRP Ledger as a global real-time payment and settlement system is more than symbolic, it signals a pivotal shift in institutional perception of blockchain. For XRP, it underscores its utility-driven design and cements its position as a leading contender in reshaping global finance. Meanwhile, XRP’s near-term outlook depends on the $2.65–$2.77 zone. Holding above it preserves the bullish setup for a push at higher resistances, while a breakdown risks a deeper correction that could stall the rally.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|WALLET|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-23 05:43:19

The company acquired 760,190 SOL, paying an average of $231 per token. The Solana position is worth about $164 million according to current market prices. Helius still has more than $335 million in cash for future purchases. Helius Medical starts accumulating SOL tokens The new Solana purchase starts the company’s $500 million digital asset treasury (DAT) strategy. Helius stated SOL tokens will be the primary holding. The plan is to expand the position over 12 to 24 months. The firm also intends to explore staking and DeFi under a conservative framework. The crypto DAT strategy follows a private placement led by Pantera Capital and Summer Capital. The raise brought in $500 million and was oversubscribed. The announcement about the treasury earlier this month drove HSDT shares more than 200% higher. Cosmo Jiang, general partner at Pantera and a board observer at Helius, called the Solana accumulation plan efficient. He stated that the SOL tokens were bought below recent market prices. Jiang added that most of the capital remains unused for later crypto opportunities. He said the plan shows shareholder focus and disciplined management. The market reacted in a negative way after the SOL purchase disclosure. HSDT stock fell about 14% on Monday, trading near $20.79 mid-session. The drop left the company with a market value of roughly $800 million. Even after the slide, shares are still up more than 200% this month. Executive chairman Joseph Chee stated that the company has gained backing from the Solana ecosystem. He cited staking providers and DeFi protocols among the supporters. Chee added that Helius is committed to delivering shareholder value. He said, “We take our responsibility to maximize shareholder value seriously and are eager to execute against our plan.” The medical company believes that Solana is “financially productive by design.” That’s because the chain processes over 3,500 transactions per second. And it has 3.7 million daily wallets and has handled 23 billion transactions this year. SOL tokens offer a native staking yield, while Bitcoin and other assets provide no yield. Helius is focused on its role as a long-term SOL holder. At the same time, the company will keep running its medical device and neurotech operations. Helius is supporting tokenized networks while expanding other areas related to its healthcare business. Helius Medical clarified that it is not connected to the Solana infrastructure startup Helius, co-founded by Mert Mumtaz. Among public companies, Forward Industries holds the largest Solana treasury at about $1.6 billion. Helius now enters the field with capital in reserve to expand further.

The lifeboat fund added that this year’s levy rules were written to allow the levy to be reduced to zero, provided the necessary legal changes made sufficient progress.. Kate Jones, chair of the PPF, commented on the bill’s progress: “The legislative changes we’ve needed to further reduce the levy have made good progress, giving us the confidence to act decisively for this year’s levy.” The PPF said its decision will offer clarity for DB schemes and their sponsors The PPF’s surplus stands at around £14 billion , but under current rules, which cap levy rises at 25%, it cannot implement a zero levy without losing the ability to raise funds again. With the Pension Schemes Bill clearing its Commons committee stage earlier this month and enjoying broad support from policymakers and stakeholders, the PPF board said it was the right time to move to a zero levy. It added that the move would “provide timely clarity for DB schemes and their sponsors,” helping them make related financial decisions this year. It also said it will keep engaging with policymakers throughout the Bill’s passage and plans to consult industry stakeholders on the 2026/27 levy once there is more clarity on the legislation. In recent years, the PPF has become much better positioned to meet pension obligations , aided by higher interest rates that have raised funding levels in defined benefit schemes by reducing the present value of their liabilities. PPF data shows that nearly 5,000 DB schemes are eligible for the pensions lifeboat. Together, they had a net surplus of about £219 billion over the cost of providing PPF-level benefits as of last March, marking a sharp improvement from a £90 billion deficit four years ago. The fund currently holds £31 billion in assets, roughly about $41 billion. Around £14 billion of this sits above the amount required to meet existing obligations, serving as a buffer against potential future claims and the risk of longer-than-expected beneficiary lifespans. Jon Forsyth and Andy Bord said they were pleased with the PPF’s zero levy confirmation According to Zoe Alexander, Pensions UK’s executive director of policy and advocacy, the PPF is well-managed and well-funded, at a time when the defined-benefit sector it supports has turned a deficit into a large aggregate surplus. She said: “The reduction of the levy to zero is positive news for DB pension funds, their members and their sponsors, and is the culmination of collaborative working and constructive conversations between Pensions UK, its members and the PPF.” Jon Forsyth, chair of the Society of Pension Professionals’ DB committee, argued similarly, welcoming the PPF’s confirmation of the zero levy. He also applauded the fund for taking action before the Pension Schemes Bill became law. Brightwell CEO Morten Nilsson also described the move as a “landmark moment.” Additionally, Andy Bord, Railpen’s CEO, said the trustee welcomed the PPF’s financial self-sufficiency milestone, given the significant contributions made by railway pension scheme members and employers.

The Ascent of AI App Development in India: A New Era? India’s vibrant tech ecosystem continues to be a hotbed of innovation, producing groundbreaking solutions that resonate globally. Rocket.new, based in Surat—a city more traditionally known for diamonds and textiles than tech—stands out as a testament to this expanding geographical footprint of Indian tech prowess. The startup has successfully raised $15 million in an all-equity seed round, spearheaded by leading global venture capital firm Salesforce Ventures , with additional participation from Accel and Together Fund. What makes this funding round particularly noteworthy is its exceptional speed; it arrives only three months after Rocket.new officially launched its platform in beta in June. This swift investment underscores a strong belief from prominent investors in the company’s unique approach to AI app development , challenging established players and offering a truly transformative solution to a widespread industry need. The company’s origins trace back to a pivot from an earlier venture, DhiWise, which focused on developer workflows. This foundational experience provided the deep insights necessary to identify a critical gap in the market: the need for AI solutions that go beyond merely assisting developers to actively building comprehensive, production-ready applications. Co-founder and CEO Vishal Virani, alongside Rahul Shingala and Deepak Dhanak, recognized that while many tools address ‘day one’ problems of quick prototyping, the real challenge lies in the ‘day two’ aspects of iteration, maintenance, and deployment for enterprise scale. Rocket.new aims to be that comprehensive solution. Rocket.new: Revolutionizing Vibe Coding for Production-Ready Solutions Many contemporary platforms offer what’s commonly referred to as ‘vibe coding,’ allowing users to quickly generate prototypes or basic applications from natural language prompts. While these tools, such as Lovable, Cursor, and Bolt, excel at speed and initial concept generation, they often fall short when it comes to delivering truly functional, scalable applications. Rocket.new distinguishes itself precisely at this juncture, focusing on building complete, production-ready applications, not just fleeting prototypes. This comprehensive approach positions Rocket.new as a formidable competitor, offering a deeper, more robust user experience. Here’s how Rocket.new sets itself apart in the evolving landscape of vibe coding : Full-Stack Application Generation: Unlike platforms that primarily generate snippets or front-end components, Rocket.new enables users to build entire, production-ready applications, complete with backend integrations and essential modules. Natural Language to Production Code: Users can simply describe their desired application in natural language, and the platform generates the necessary source code, making complex development accessible to a wider audience. Integrated AI Architecture: The platform combines sophisticated large language models from industry leaders like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google’s Gemini with Rocket.new’s own deep learning systems. These proprietary systems are trained on extensive datasets derived from their previous venture, DhiWise, providing a unique edge in code quality and application logic. Focus on ‘Day Two’ Problems: While initial application generation might take around 25 minutes—longer than some competitors—the result is a more fully-featured and comprehensive application, including all essential modules. This commitment to completeness addresses the critical challenges of scaling, maintaining, and deploying applications effectively. Virani emphasizes that their underlying architecture is fundamentally different from what other platforms are doing, leading to a more comprehensive and usable output. This commitment to delivering a complete solution is a game-changer in the vibe coding landscape, especially for those looking to launch functional products quickly and efficiently. Unprecedented Growth: What’s Driving Rocket.new’s Success as an Indian AI Startup?

Ambitious targets to scale to $20–$25 million by year-end and a staggering $60–$70 million by June next year . This rapid adoption is driven by a diverse user base, including product managers, solopreneurs, and front-end developers from major global companies like Meta, PayPal, KPMG, PwC, and Times Internet. These users are leveraging the platform for a wide array of personal projects and even internal tools, validating the platform’s utility across different professional needs. Approximately 80% of users are building what Virani calls ‘serious’ applications, indicating a focus on functional, impactful projects rather than simple landing pages. The types of applications created are highly varied: Roughly 12% have created e-commerce platforms (grocery, apparel). 10% have built fintech apps. 5–6% have developed B2B tools. 4–5% have launched mental health apps. Furthermore, approximately 45% of Rocket.new’s users are building mobile apps, while 55% are focused on websites. A notable trend sees many users starting a website on platforms like Lovable or Replit, then turning to Rocket.new to generate a native mobile app by integrating with their existing Supabase backend. This highlights Rocket.new’s ability to complement existing developer workflows while offering unique capabilities. The company’s vision extends beyond mere code generation; it aims to become a comprehensive ‘agentic system’ that utilizes AI not only to build apps and websites but also to conduct competitive research and product development, potentially eliminating the need for traditional product managers. This holistic approach is a testament to the forward-thinking nature of this burgeoning Indian AI startup , aiming to revolutionize the entire product development lifecycle. Strategic Investment: Why are Salesforce Ventures and Accel Backing Rocket.new? The $15 million all-equity seed round, led by Salesforce Ventures , is a powerful endorsement of Rocket.new’s innovative platform and immense market potential. The participation of Accel and Together Fund further solidifies the confidence of leading venture capital firms in the startup’s vision and execution. Kartik Gupta, Investor at Salesforce Ventures, articulated the core reason behind their investment in an exclusive interview: “We saw a clear gap between the magic of AI code generation and the reality of making that code production-ready. Rocket.new is purpose-built to solve this problem of iteration, maintenance, and deployment at enterprise scale.” This strategic investment will be instrumental in fueling Rocket.new’s ambitious growth plans. The funding will enable the startup to: Sharpen its go-to-market playbook: Optimizing strategies to reach and acquire new users more efficiently. Deepen its presence in key markets: Expanding operations and support in high-growth regions. Accelerate work on proprietary models and R&D: Investing further in its unique AI architecture to maintain a competitive edge and develop new features.

Suspicious Activity Reports Hit Record High On Monday, Jin Sung-joon, a Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) lawmaker on the National Assembly’s Planning and Finance Committee, reportedly warned of the potential exploitation of digital assets amid the crypto industry’s increasing adoption. “As stablecoins are increasingly used as payment and settlement tools in the real economy, the potential for their misuse in foreign exchange crimes like illegal currency exchange is growing,” Jin stated. The lawmaker shared data from the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), revealing that the number of STRs received from local virtual asset service providers (VASPs) has nearly doubled this year. STRs hit a total of 36,684 cases between January and August, exceeding the combined cases from the previous two years. The number of cases from the first eight months of 2025 represents an 86% increase from 2024’s total cases. Notably, the number of cases received has surged significantly over the past five years, jumping from 199 in 2021 to 10,797 in 2022. Meanwhile, the FIU recorded 16,076 and 19,658 STR cases in 2023 and 2024, respectively. For context, domestic VASPs are required to report transactions suspected of money laundering and illicit activities to the FIU under the current Specific Financial Information Act. Additionally, exchanges must formally register as a VASP with the FIU to obtain a license and be able to conduct business in South Korea, such as storage, brokerage, and management of crypto assets. Earlier this year, the financial authority found that many well-known overseas crypto exchanges, including BitMEX, KuCoin, CoinW, Bitunix, and KCEX, were not registered as VASPs, which led to 17 crypto apps being blocked in March. According to Korea Customs Service (KCS) data highlighted by the lawmaker, the value of crypto-related crimes referred to prosecutors hit 9.5 trillion won, or $7.1 billion, between January 2021 and August 2025. 90% of these crimes involved illegal cross-border remittances facilitated by unlicensed channels. South Korea’s Crypto Oversight Authorities have also confirmed cases involving the use of stablecoins in illegal transactions. Jin affirmed that all relevant agencies must work together to take effective actions that address the rise of these new types of crimes and develop a system to prevent these illicit activities. Relevant agencies, including the Customs Service and the FIU, must implement effective crackdowns—such as tracking criminal funds and blocking disguised transfers—while also developing systematic countermeasures against these new types of foreign exchange crimes. It’s worth noting that the Financial Services Commission (FSC) has been working to develop digital assets legislation and shift its regulatory approach over the past year. The financial authority is expected to release the long-awaited framework for the issuance and distribution of won-backed stablecoins next month. As the stablecoin sector gains momentum worldwide, South Korean lawmakers have pushed to establish the necessary legislation, with multiple bills being introduced in the National Assembly this year, including two rival bills in July by Korea’s ruling and opposition parties. The banking sector has reportedly been in talks with Tether and Circle to discuss potential partnerships, as it has been exploring various legalization scenarios over the past few months. Ahead of the highly anticipated regulatory framework, digital asset custody firm BDACS officially launched the first South Korean won-backed stablecoin, KRW1, on the Avalanche blockchain. In collaboration with Woori Bank, one of the four largest domestic financial institutions in the country, the crypto custodian plans to utilize the won-pegged stablecoin as a “low-cost payment and settlement system for public-sector programs” and build the “backbone of the digital asset market.”",Crypto News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-23 06:00:04

Some analysts suggest that the leading altcoin is poised to bounce soon as crypto treasury companies continue to bet on the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck In Neutral While Markets Roar — Analyst Explains Why Ethereum Eyes Rebound Amid $4,100 Retest On Monday, Ethereum’s price dropped around 7% during the largest liquidation event of the year so far. Notably, the crypto market saw more than $1.7 billion in leveraged positions liquidated over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data. ETH led the losses with nearly $500 million in liquidations, followed by Bitcoin’s $284 million. This dragged the King of Altcoin’s price to the crucial $4,100 support for the first time since August, hitting a one-month low of $4,077. Daan Crypto Trades highlighted that today’s event was the largest nominal Ethereum liquidation since 2021, when the cryptocurrency’s price dropped around 45% in a single day. However, various market watchers noted that the price decline was relatively tame compared to previous liquidations of this scale. As the second-largest cryptocurrency dropped to the $4,100 support, some analysts suggested that Ethereum is gearing up for a rebound. Merlijn The Trader affirmed that ETH is “following the blueprint” to a five-digit target. Per the trader, the cryptocurrency rallied to its previous all-time high (ATH) of $4,800 after breaking out of a multi-year bullish pattern. Following its breakout from an Adam and Eve formation in 2021, the leading altcoin retested the level as support and consolidated around this area for three months before the next leg up. This time, Ethereum displays a new textbook setup with a multi-year descending triangle formation, which was broken out of last month and is currently being retested as support. According to the market watcher, ETH could see a 2021-like breakout toward the $10,000 barrier. Nonetheless, Ted Pillows asserted that the altcoin must hold the $4,100 area as support for a short-term bounce. “If this level is lost, Ethereum will drop towards the $3,700-$3,800 level,” the analyst warned. BitMine Holds 2% Of ETH Supply Despite the market downturn, corporations continue to bet on the second-largest cryptocurrency for their Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) strategies. BitMine, the second-largest crypto treasury, revealed that it has increased its ETH holdings to nearly 2.5 million tokens over the past week, as part of its goal to hold 5% of Ethereum’s total supply. BitMine now owns over 2% of the supply with 2,416,054 ETH, solidifying its position as the largest ETH Treasury in the world. According to the Monday announcement, the company now holds $11.4 billion in assets, including the 2.4 million ETH tokens, 192 Bitcoin (BTC), $175 million stake in Eightco Holdings for its “Moonshot” initiative, and unencumbered cash of $345 million. Additionally, the company is the 24th most traded stock in the US, with an average daily volume of $3.5 billion, according to 5-day average data from Fundstrat. Related Reading: Solana Faces Deadly Selling Pressure After 312,233 SOL Deposit Into Coinbase – Here’s The Value BitMine’s chairman, Thomas “Tom” Lee, stated that the company continues “to believe Ethereum is one of the biggest macro trades over the next 10-15 years,” adding that “Wall Street and AI moving onto the blockchain should lead to a greater transformation of today’s financial system. And the majority of this is taking place on Ethereum.” As of this writing, ETH is trading at $4,145, an 8% decline in the weekly timeframe.

Given the number of crypto networks and tokens now on the market, however, it’s okay if you don’t have all the pertinent facts about FTN and Bahamut to hand: we’re about to see to that. In short, though, FTN has been on a roll lately and is currently up 75% for the year to date with a market cap sitting at almost $2B. In tandem with this, Bahamut has also been posting some impressive numbers, with over 7 million accounts created and more than 71 million transactions to date. Something’s going on, but what exactly? Why is Bahamut’s Layer-1 network and token thriving when other chains are resembling ghost towns? Answering these questions calls for examining the key data points defining the network and native token to get a handle on what’s happened – and where Bahamut’s ecosystem is headed next. Bahamut: A Monster Blockchain If you’re wondering how Bahamut got its name, the official version goes like this: “In ancient mythology, Bahamut was a giant fish or sea monster that supported the earth, lying deep below the surface of the water. It was said to be so massive that it could swallow entire oceans, and its scales were believed to be impenetrable.” Part of the Fastex ecosystem, Bahamut is an EVM-compatible Layer 1 that employs a unique Proof of Stake and Activity ( PoSA ) consensus mechanism. This rewards validators not just for holding staked assets but for active contributions such as building smart contracts and participating in network activity. In this respect, Bahamut is at the vanguard of a blockchain-wide trend towards incentivizing user behavior that adds real value to strengthen network effects, create positive feedback loops, drive greater community participation, and fairly allocate rewards. But enough about the ethos. Let’s talk about the raw numbers behind Bahamut. Why Bahamut Is a Big Beast Monstrous name aside, Bahamut is a colossus in other ways, not least when it comes to actual onchain activity: real actions made by real users. Aside from the impressive 7M+ and 71M+ transactions that we’ve already detailed, there are other benchmarks worth reeling off, like the fact that the network has faithfully processed 6.3M blocks to date. The PoSA consensus works. As for why users have been taking to Bahamut in their numbers, there are a few reasons that spring to mind. One is the reach and reputation of the Fastex ecosystem, headed by its digital asset exchange that forms the jumping-off point for Bahamut discovery. It’s easy for users to withdraw FTN from Fastex straight to their Bahamut wallet and start exploring. And there’s a surprising amount to explore on a blockchain that only launched in May: Bahamut’s TVL is already over $124M, which is quite impressive. (For comparison, zKSync’s is o[]ly $54M.) Much of the Total Value Locked on Bahamut comes from liquid staking, but there’s also the beginnings of a DeFi ecosystem taking shape. Users who take the plunge and seek sanctuary on the big beast that is Bahamut will find lending courtesy of Percentme; bridging from Symbiosis; and DEXs from the likes of SilkSwap and Kujata. Naturally, much of the activity that takes place on these decentralized exchanges utilizes FTN as a base currency, which brings us on to our second area of analysis: Fasttoken. FTN by Numbers Fasttoken (FTN) wears a lot of hats – or rather fulfills a lot of use cases – since it serves as both the native asset of Bahamut and a broader utility token within the Fastex ecosystem. It’s been integrated into ecommerce and gaming platforms, is supported by various payment providers, and listed on 15 centralized exchanges, including Fastex, of course. It now plays a major role on Bahamut’s blockchain, however, where its adoption has been one of the catalysts driving FTN to greater heights this year. More than 40M FTN is now staked on the network across various liquid staking dapps, while its onchain daily trading volume exceeds a respectable $15M. To accelerate the growth of dapps on the Layer-1 network, the Bahamut Grants Program has been seeded with a 10M FTN fund, which is available to developers building out its infrastructure and creating dapps that expand the use cases and sectors the blockchain supports. Securing the network are over 4,400 validators, who earn rewards based on both staked FTN and their activity levels, which encourages ongoing participation. This contrasts with traditional PoS models that tend to favor large stakers. A previous token burn of 120 million FTN, reducing the total supply from 1 billion to 880 million, was a deliberate step to enhance scarcity and fund validation rewards, laying the groundwork for this expansion. With total trading volume both on Bahamut and on centralized exchanges averaging around $60M, there’s clearly organic demand for FTN. Community and Global Adoption Blockchain success hinges on more than merely having the best tech: it’s also about people and integrations. And as an examination of the Bahamut and FTN community shows, there’s a large and highly engaged user base in place here. The global FTN community exceeds 50,000 members across platforms like Telegram, X, and Discord. This base includes developers, gamers, and traders who are utilizing the FTN token for everything from staking to payments. The token is integrated with more than 10 payment providers, enabling seamless crypto transactions for real-world purchases. For instance, NOWPayments allows merchants to accept FTN with low fees and instant settlements. As of mid-September 2025, FTN is trading at approximately $4.5, with a market capitalization of $1.9 billion based on a circulating supply of about 433 million tokens. This positions FTN as a mid-cap asset, ranking in the top 200 cryptocurrencies. The token reached its peak of ~$4.60 in July 2025, driven by broader market rallies and Bahamut’s mainnet milestones. Currently, it’s trading just below that level, leaving it within touching distance of its all-time high. Unlike many mid-cap assets, FTN is a relatively stable crypto, helped by the fact that much of its supply is locked into staking contracts. This is bullish for FTN since it not only decreased sell pressure but demonstrates that the majority of the token’s holders are in it for the long haul and have no intention of going anywhere. Provided the crypto market keeps ticking over, as it looks to be the case, there’s grounds for confidence that FTN will push higher to reach $5. Beyond there, it’s uncharted territory, but if Bahamut can keep shipping and onboarding more partners and dapps, there’s every reason to believe that FTN has further to run. Fasttoken was already a solid mid-cap asset with industry-wide integration before the launch of Bahamut. The release of Bahamut, with its PoSA consensus, has put the afterburners on. It’s effectively transformed FTN from an exchange and payments token into a versatile staking asset and DeFi utility token whose use cases are still expanding. If it’s been under your radar up until now, add FTN to your watchlist. As Bahamut expands, FTN is poised to rise with it, bringing new users and use cases into its blockchain ecosystem.",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-23 06:07:50

Just a month after projecting a massive 126-fold surge for the HYPE token, Hayes revealed he had sold his entire position. This bold decision, announced during a media interview at KBW 2025, sparked immediate discussions among investors and analysts alike. So, what exactly prompted this swift pivot regarding his Arthur Hayes HYPE holdings? What Prompted the Arthur Hayes HYPE Sale? Hayes didn’t mince words about his rationale. He framed the sale as a calculated move for rational portfolio management, driven by a clear assessment of immediate challenges facing HYPE. These aren’t speculative fears; they are concrete market dynamics that demand attention from any savvy investor. Selling Pressure from Monthly Token Unlocks: A significant factor cited was the impending monthly token unlocks. These scheduled releases often flood the market with new supply, creating downward pressure as early investors or team members may choose to sell their holdings. Weakening Fee Competitiveness: Hayes also pointed to HYPE’s declining competitiveness in terms of fees. In the fast-evolving crypto landscape, projects must constantly innovate to maintain their edge. A loss in this area can directly impact a token’s utility and perceived value, affecting the overall sentiment around Arthur Hayes HYPE . Balancing Short-Term Caution with Long-Term Vision for HYPE Despite the immediate concerns that led to the Arthur Hayes HYPE sale, Hayes was quick to clarify his underlying belief. He explicitly stated that his conviction in HYPE’s long-term potential remains unshaken. This creates an interesting dichotomy: a tactical exit based on current market headwinds, yet an unwavering faith in the project’s future. Interestingly, Hayes previously shared a more personal, albeit candid, reason for part of his sale. He needed funds for a down payment on a Ferrari. While seemingly trivial, this anecdote highlights that even prominent figures make portfolio decisions influenced by personal financial goals, alongside strategic market assessments. It’s a powerful reminder that investment choices are rarely one-dimensional. Key Lessons from Arthur Hayes’ HYPE Strategy Hayes’ decision offers valuable insights for any crypto investor. It underscores the importance of a dynamic approach to portfolio management, where short-term risks are actively monitored and addressed, even for assets with strong long-term prospects. Here are some key takeaways: Risk Assessment is Crucial: Regularly evaluate both macro and micro factors affecting your holdings. Tokenomics, like unlock schedules, can significantly impact price action. Differentiate Short-Term from Long-Term: Understand that temporary headwinds do not necessarily invalidate a project’s fundamental value. Your investment horizon dictates your strategy, especially when dealing with assets like Arthur Hayes HYPE . Portfolio Rebalancing: Don’t be afraid to rebalance or exit positions tactically if new information or market conditions present significant short-term risks, even if you remain bullish long-term. Personal Financial Goals Matter: Your personal financial needs can and should influence your investment decisions. It’s not just about market charts; it’s about your life goals too. Arthur Hayes’ recent Arthur Hayes HYPE sale serves as a potent reminder that even seasoned investors like the BitMEX co-founder navigate the crypto markets with a blend of strategic foresight and tactical flexibility. His move was not a repudiation of HYPE’s long-term vision, but rather a pragmatic response to identifiable short-term risks. For investors, this story highlights the necessity of continuous risk assessment, understanding market dynamics, and maintaining a clear distinction between short-term volatility and long-term potential. It’s a powerful lesson in adapting your strategy to thrive in the ever-evolving world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Why did Arthur Hayes sell his HYPE tokens?

For enthusiasts and investors keenly observing the cryptocurrency space, understanding the broader technological shifts is crucial, as AI’s advancements frequently parallel or even drive innovation in blockchain and decentralized technologies. The latest move by OpenAI to launch its budget-friendly ChatGPT Go plan in Indonesia, following its successful debut in India, signals a strategic pivot towards democratizing AI access, a development that could profoundly influence digital economies and user engagement across Southeast Asia. ChatGPT Go ‘s Strategic Expansion: What’s Driving OpenAI’s Move? OpenAI, a trailblazer in artificial intelligence, is meticulously charting its course for global dominance by making its sophisticated AI tools accessible to a broader demographic. The launch of the ChatGPT Go plan in Indonesia, priced at an attractive Rp75,000 (approximately $4.50) per month, is not merely an expansion; it is a calculated strategic maneuver. This follows a highly successful rollout in India, where the introduction of a sub-$5 paid plan led to a remarkable doubling of paid subscribers, as noted by ChatGPT head Nick Turley on X. This aggressive expansion into key emerging markets like India and Indonesia underscores a fundamental shift in OpenAI’s business model. While premium services like ChatGPT Plus, priced at $20 per month, cater to power users and professionals in developed economies, the ChatGPT Go plan targets a vast, untapped market segment. This segment comprises users who seek more robust AI capabilities than the free version offers but find the premium plan financially prohibitive. By offering a mid-tier solution, OpenAI aims to: Broaden its user base: Tapping into millions of new potential users in populous, digitally active nations. Foster AI adoption: Accelerating the integration of AI into daily life and small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs). Gather diverse data: Learning from varied usage patterns and preferences in different cultural contexts, which is invaluable for refining AI models. Establish early market leadership: Gaining a foothold before competitors can fully entrench themselves. The features bundled with ChatGPT Go are designed to offer a significant upgrade from the free tier without overwhelming users with advanced functionalities. Subscribers benefit from 10 times higher usage limits for sending questions or prompts, generating images, and uploading files. Crucially, the plan also enhances ChatGPT’s ability to ‘remember’ previous conversations better, enabling more personalized and contextually relevant responses over time. This improved conversational memory is a game-changer for users seeking a more coherent and efficient interaction with the AI, moving beyond simple query-response to a more assistant-like experience. Unpacking the Value: How Affordable AI Transforms Access The concept of affordable AI is more than just a pricing strategy; it is a powerful catalyst for digital inclusion and economic empowerment, particularly in nations like Indonesia. By lowering the financial barrier to entry for advanced AI tools, OpenAI is not just selling a product; it is democratizing access to a technology that holds immense potential for personal and professional growth. For individuals, affordable AI means: Enhanced learning: Students can access a powerful tutor and research assistant without significant cost. Creative empowerment: Aspiring content creators, artists, and writers can leverage AI for brainstorming, drafting, and generating ideas. Productivity boost: Professionals and freelancers can automate mundane tasks, summarize information, and generate content more efficiently. For small businesses and entrepreneurs in Indonesia, the availability of affordable AI tools like ChatGPT Go can level the playing field, allowing them to compete more effectively with larger corporations. They can utilize AI for customer service, marketing content generation, data analysis, and even basic product design, all at a fraction of the cost traditionally associated with such capabilities. This directly contributes to economic development by fostering innovation and efficiency within the SME sector, which is often the backbone of emerging economies. The tiered subscription model adopted by OpenAI is a clever way to cater to a spectrum of user needs and budgets: Feature/Plan Free Version ChatGPT Go (Mid-Tier) ChatGPT Plus (Premium) Price Free ~Rp75,000 ($4.50)/month $20/month Usage Limits Standard/Limited 10x Higher than Free Highest Priority/Generous Image Generation Limited/Basic Included Advanced/Priority File Uploads Limited Included Included Conversational Memory Basic Enhanced/Personalized Highly Advanced/Contextual Access to Latest Models Delayed/Older Improved Priority/Newest This clear delineation allows users to choose a plan that best fits their usage intensity and budget, maximizing the impact of affordable AI across different segments of the population. The Battle for Southeast Asia: OpenAI vs. Google AI Plus in Indonesia AI Market OpenAI’s strategic move into Indonesia is not occurring in a vacuum. The competitive landscape for AI services, particularly in high-growth markets, is intensifying. This expansion puts OpenAI in direct competition with tech behemoth Google, which has also recognized the immense potential of the Indonesia AI market. Earlier this month, Google launched its own similarly-priced AI Plus subscription plan in Indonesia, setting the stage for a significant battle for market share. Google’s AI Plus plan is a formidable contender, offering a comprehensive suite of AI-powered tools and services. Subscribers to Google’s plan gain access to its advanced Gemini 2.5 Pro chatbot, which is lauded for its multimodal capabilities and performance. Beyond the chatbot, Google’s offering integrates a robust set of creative tools for image and video creation, including Flow, Whisk, and Veo 3 Fast. These tools empower users to generate high-quality visual content, appealing to a broad spectrum of digital creators and businesses. Furthermore, Google’s AI Plus plan includes enhanced features for its AI research assistant NotebookLM, making it an invaluable asset for academics, researchers, and anyone dealing with large volumes of information. Perhaps most compellingly, the plan seamlessly integrates AI capabilities into Google’s widely used productivity suite: Gmail, Docs, and Sheets. This integration allows for AI-powered assistance in writing emails, drafting documents, and analyzing spreadsheets, significantly boosting productivity for millions of existing Google Workspace users. To sweeten the deal, Google also bundles 200GB of cloud storage, adding practical value to its AI subscription. The direct comparison reveals a fascinating strategic divergence: OpenAI (ChatGPT Go): Focuses primarily on advanced conversational AI, image generation, and personalized interactions through improved memory and higher usage limits for its core ChatGPT product. Its strength lies in the direct interaction with a powerful large language model. Google (AI Plus): Offers a broader ecosystem play, integrating its Gemini AI across its existing popular services (Gmail, Docs, Sheets) and providing a suite of specialized creative tools. Its strength is leveraging its vast ecosystem and multimodal AI capabilities. This rivalry in the Indonesia AI market signifies that both tech giants view Southeast Asia as a critical battleground for future AI adoption and revenue. The competition is expected to drive further innovation, potentially leading to even more advanced and accessible AI solutions for users in the region. Why Indonesia AI is a Key Battleground for Tech Giants Indonesia, with its vast population of over 270 million people and a rapidly expanding digital economy, represents an irresistible market for global tech companies. The nation’s youthful demographic, increasing smartphone penetration, and growing digital literacy make it an ideal environment for the widespread adoption of AI services. The push for Indonesia AI development is also supported by government initiatives aimed at digital transformation and fostering a vibrant tech ecosystem. Several factors make Indonesia a crucial market for AI expansion: Demographic Dividend: A large, young, and tech-savvy population eager to adopt new technologies. Economic Growth: A steadily growing economy with increasing disposable income, enabling more people to afford digital subscriptions. Digital Penetration: High rates of internet and smartphone usage, providing a ready infrastructure for AI service delivery. Untapped Potential: A significant portion of the population is still relatively new to advanced digital tools, presenting a massive opportunity for first-mover advantage. Government Support: National strategies to boost digital infrastructure and AI capabilities. However, entering the Indonesia AI market also comes with its unique set of challenges. Localization is paramount; AI models need to be trained and fine-tuned to understand the nuances of the Indonesian language (Bahasa Indonesia) and local cultural contexts. Data privacy and regulatory compliance are also critical considerations, requiring careful navigation to build trust with users and adhere to local laws. Infrastructure, while improving, can still pose challenges in terms of consistent high-speed internet access across the archipelago. Both OpenAI and Google are likely investing heavily in these areas, understanding that success in Indonesia hinges not just on product features but also on cultural relevance and robust local support. The success of ChatGPT Go in Indonesia will serve as a blueprint for future expansions into other Southeast Asian nations and similar emerging markets. The Future of Affordable AI : What’s Next for Emerging Markets? The introduction of affordable AI plans in countries like India and Indonesia marks the beginning of a new era for artificial intelligence. This strategic shift towards mass-market accessibility is set to have profound implications for emerging markets globally. As AI tools become more ubiquitous and financially viable, we can anticipate a ripple effect across various sectors. The impact will be felt in: Education: Personalized learning experiences, AI tutors, and research tools will become standard, bridging educational gaps. Healthcare: AI-powered diagnostics, administrative support, and patient engagement tools can improve access and efficiency. Small Business Innovation: Entrepreneurs will have powerful tools to innovate, optimize operations, and reach new customers. Content Creation: The creative industry will see an explosion of AI-assisted content, from marketing materials to entertainment. Digital Economy Growth: AI will drive new business models, create jobs, and foster digital transformation at an accelerated pace. The competitive dynamics between OpenAI and Google AI Plus will likely lead to a continuous cycle of innovation and price adjustments, ultimately benefiting consumers. As more users adopt these services, the data generated will further refine AI models, making them even more intelligent and responsive to user needs. This feedback loop is essential for the long-term development of AI. Furthermore, the success in Indonesia could inspire other AI companies to explore similar strategies for market penetration in other emerging economies across Africa, Latin America, and other parts of Asia. The lessons learned from localization, pricing, and feature bundling in Indonesia will be invaluable for these future expansions. The future of AI is not just about cutting-edge research; it’s increasingly about making that research practical, accessible, and affordable for everyone, everywhere. A Compelling Leap Towards Global AI Accessibility OpenAI’s launch of its ChatGPT Go plan in Indonesia, following its resounding success in India, represents a monumental stride towards democratizing advanced artificial intelligence. By offering a robust yet affordable AI solution, OpenAI is not only expanding its global footprint but also fostering digital inclusion and innovation in key emerging markets. This strategic move places it in direct competition with Google’s comprehensive Google AI Plus offering in the vibrant Indonesia AI market, setting the stage for an exciting era of technological competition and user-centric advancements. As these tech giants vie for dominance, the ultimate beneficiaries will be millions of individuals and businesses who gain unprecedented access to powerful AI tools, driving forward the digital transformation of nations and shaping the future of global AI adoption.

Story will serve as the licensing infrastructure, registering and managing IP usage on its Layer-1 network. Verse8 enables users to generate multiplayer 2D and 3D games through natural language prompts without requiring coding. The platform uses proprietary technology to produce 3D assets from a single image. Despite being in beta, Verse8 reports thousands of creators and more than 800,000 monthly active users. By integrating with Story’s programmable licensing system, content created in Verse8—such as characters, quests, and environments—can be registered on-chain with attribution and revenue-sharing mechanisms for IP holders and creators. As part of the collaboration, Moonbirds and Azuki collections will be available within Verse8’s AI-driven builder. Creators will be able to customize these IPs, incorporate them into new game environments, and monetize content through in-game purchases and branded expansions. Revenue distribution will be handled via programmable royalties recorded on Story’s blockchain. The partnership will debut at Origin Summit in Seoul on September 23, 2025. In the coming months, users will be able to launch community-made games featuring Moonbirds and Azuki characters through Verse8. Verse8 was co-created by Jake Song, co-founder of Nexon and developer of Lineage, a leading MMORPG IP. The platform is supported by Planetarium Labs and industry partners. The collaboration with Story introduces licensed IP into AI-generated game environments with clear attribution and licensing rules enforced through smart contracts. To showcase the power of this model, Verse8 will provide support for two of Web3’s most iconic IPs: Moonbirds and Azuki. Both collections will be registered on Story, and their IP will be natively available inside Verse8’s AI-driven game builder. Players can remix, customize, and build with these IPs as “IP Legos,” assembling characters, quests, and game mechanics using the familiar building blocks of beloved onchain brands . Game creators can monetize their worlds through in-game purchases or branded expansions, with revenue automatically split between the creator, the original NFT holder, and the Brand / IP owners via programmable royalties. For example, a player could design an Azuki-themed cyberpunk battle arena with custom avatars and lore, then offer premium content like exclusive weapons or missions, while ensuring a share of that revenue flows back to Azuki’s creators and NFT holders. This marks the first time IP holders of these NFT collections can seamlessly bring their IP into an interactive gaming format, with all usage rights, attributions, and revenue shares enforced via smart contracts on Story in the future. The partnership will debut at Origin Summit in Seoul on September 23, 2025, in the coming months, users will be able to launch community-made games featuring Moonbirds and Azuki characters powered by Verse8’s AI engine and Story’s onchain licensing system. Building the Future of IP-Native Games Verse8 represents a breakthrough in how IP can be activated and extended across user-generated gaming experiences. With zero-code interfaces and real-time rendering, players can build expansive game worlds, storylines, and playable quests simply by describing them in natural language. By integrating with Story, all IP used in these environments becomes traceable, licensable, and governed by clear onchain rules. The platform joins a growing ecosystem of Story-powered applications—including Aria (music IP as real-world assets), Poseidon (AI training data layer), and the IP Portal—cementing Story’s role as the programmable IP layer for the AI era. Integration of AI, IP, and On-Chain Licensing The collaboration between Verse8 and Story reflects broader developments in digital entertainment and intellectual property. Intellectual property is recognized as one of the largest global asset classes but is often difficult to license and manage across platforms. Advances in artificial intelligence increase the demand for verified, rights-cleared content, while blockchain infrastructure enables automated attribution and royalty distribution. By using Story’s programmable licensing system, assets created in Verse8 can be registered, attributed, and governed on-chain, providing clarity for creators and IP holders. S.Y. Lee, Co-Founder, Story “IP isn’t meant to sit still. With programmable infrastructure, it becomes interactive, remixable, and composable and ready for a world where culture is built by communities and powered by agents. Verse8 shows what this future looks like: a platform where anyone can create multiplayer games using the IP they love, with onchain rails that respect rights, trace value, and unlock new markets.” Kevin Lee, CEO, Verse8: “Story gives us the missing layer we needed: trusted licensing infrastructure that works in real time, at scale, for user-generated content. With Story, every interaction in Verse8, whether it’s remixing characters, building quests, or sharing games, can now respect rights, share value, and evolve IP organically. It’s not just content creation, it’s IP-native worldbuilding.” Spencer Gordon-Sand, CEO of Moonbirds: “Moonbirds is such a strong IP. Our community is full of forward thinking technologists many of whom have been at the forefront of AI. We are one of the few brands who immediately and actively leaned into the AI wave we see shaping how IP grows and is utilized in the coming years. We are excited to see Verse8 expand the way that our community can engage with the IP they co-own alongside us and use the platform to further expand its growth and utilization.” Zagabond, Founder of Azuki (CEO, Chiru Labs): “Azuki has always believed in empowering our community to co-create stories. With Verse8 and Story, that vision continues to be realized. Fans can now build entire playable worlds with Azuki IP onchain, and I’m excited to see the endless possibilities created from the community.” About Story Story is a Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built to make intellectual property programmable. Backed by $136 million from a16z, Polychain, and Samsung Ventures, Story launched its mainnet in early 2025 and has quickly become a leading infrastructure for tokenized IP. The network enables creators, developers, enterprises, and AI labs to register content as on-chain assets with embedded rights, turning media, data, and AI-generated works into legally enforceable digital property. By bridging the gap between outdated legal frameworks and the realities of the AI era, Story makes it possible to track provenance, automate licensing, and unlock new markets for ideas. As the foundation for IP’s evolution into an internet-native asset class, Story powers a more open, equitable, and composable creative economy. About Verse8 Verse8 is a fully AI-powered game creation platform that allows anyone to build, publish, and share high-quality 2D and 3D multiplayer games using simple natural language prompts.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, this significant Bitcoin price surge has pushed BTC to trade at an impressive $113,050.84 on the Binance USDT market. This spectacular rally has captivated investors and analysts alike, prompting discussions about the underlying forces driving this upward momentum and what it could mean for the broader digital asset landscape. What’s Fueling This Phenomenal Bitcoin Price Surge? Several key factors appear to be converging to ignite this impressive rally. Understanding these drivers helps us grasp current market dynamics and anticipate future movements. Investors are closely watching global economic indicators and technological advancements. Market Sentiment and Investor Confidence: A wave of optimism is sweeping through the crypto community. Positive news, such as increasing institutional adoption and favorable regulatory discussions, often boosts investor confidence. This collective belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value acts as a powerful catalyst for price increases. Institutional Interest and Adoption: Major financial institutions are increasingly allocating capital to Bitcoin. Their entry brings significant liquidity and validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. This institutional influx provides substantial buying pressure, contributing directly to the Bitcoin price surge . Technical Indicators and Chart Patterns: Seasoned traders often analyze historical price data and chart patterns to predict future movements. When key resistance levels are broken, it can trigger automated buying orders, accelerating an upward trend. Many analysts had eyes on the $110,000 mark as a critical breakout point. These elements combine to create a potent environment for upward price action. Moreover, the broader macroeconomic environment, including inflation concerns and the search for alternative assets, also plays a role in Bitcoin’s appeal. Navigating the Highs: Opportunities and Risks for Investors While a significant Bitcoin price surge presents exciting opportunities, it also comes with inherent risks. Astute investors understand the importance of balancing potential gains with careful risk management. The volatile nature of cryptocurrencies demands a thoughtful approach. What are the Potential Benefits for BTC Holders? Capital Appreciation: Existing holders naturally see the value of their portfolios increase dramatically. This can lead to substantial profits if they choose to realize their gains. Increased Market Visibility: A strong rally draws new attention to Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. This increased visibility can attract new investors and further accelerate adoption. Validation of Bitcoin’s Role: Reaching new price milestones reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a leading digital store of value and a viable investment asset, strengthening its long-term narrative. However, investors must remain vigilant. Cryptocurrency markets are known for their rapid price swings. What goes up quickly can also correct sharply, emphasizing the need for a clear strategy. Understanding the Risks Investing during a rapid price increase carries specific considerations. Market corrections can occur swiftly, leading to significant losses for those who enter at the peak without a clear exit strategy. Regulatory changes or unexpected negative news could also trigger a downturn. Therefore, conducting thorough research and only investing what you can afford to lose remains paramount. Beyond $113,000: What’s Next for the Bitcoin Price Surge? As Bitcoin breaches new psychological barriers, the question on everyone’s mind is, “What comes next?” Predicting future price movements in the crypto market is challenging, yet several factors will likely influence Bitcoin’s trajectory following this remarkable Bitcoin price surge . Continued Institutional Adoption: If more major financial players enter the space, either through direct investment or by offering crypto-related products, it could provide sustained upward pressure. Regulatory Clarity: Clear and favorable regulations from governments worldwide could significantly de-risk Bitcoin for traditional investors, paving the way for even wider adoption and potentially higher valuations. Technological Developments: Ongoing advancements within the Bitcoin network, such as scalability solutions or enhanced security features, can strengthen its fundamental value proposition and appeal. The journey past $113,000 is not just about a number; it reflects growing confidence in Bitcoin’s enduring utility and its potential to reshape the global financial landscape. While volatility is a constant companion in crypto, the current momentum suggests a robust and evolving market. A Momentous Ascent for Bitcoin The recent ascent of Bitcoin above $113,000 marks a truly significant moment in its history. This extraordinary Bitcoin price surge , driven by a confluence of positive market sentiment, increasing institutional interest, and favorable technical indicators, underscores the digital asset’s growing maturity and appeal.

Sygnia’s CEO, Magda Wierzycka, has been vocal about the firm’s decision, emphasizing a commitment to shielding investors from what she describes as “foolish behavior.” The firm, which manages an impressive portfolio of approximately $20 billion in assets, firmly believes that cryptocurrency, while valuable, should only constitute a small, strategic part of a diversified portfolio. It should never be an asset on which to bet everything. This proactive intervention by Sygnia underscores a fundamental principle of responsible financial stewardship. Wierzycka’s rationale is clear: despite Bitcoin’s undeniable appeal and its potential for growth, allocating an excessive portion of one’s wealth to such a volatile asset can expose investors to undue and potentially catastrophic risk. Therefore, Sygnia’s approach is meticulously designed to foster a balanced investment strategy, ensuring clients do not place all their financial eggs into one speculative basket. Evolving Perspectives: Bitcoin’s Journey from Speculation to Viable Asset It is particularly interesting to note that Sygnia’s own perspective on Bitcoin has undergone a significant evolution. Previously, the firm held a view that Bitcoin was purely speculative. However, a deeper understanding and market maturation have led them to now consider it a viable long-term investment. This shift reflects a broader, increasing institutional acceptance of digital assets, even while maintaining a judiciously cautious stance on allocation. Despite this positive re-evaluation of Bitcoin’s long-term potential, the firm’s core investment advice remains inherently conservative. Sygnia’s official fund prospectuses explicitly recommend a strict guideline: no more than 5% of managed assets should be allocated to Bitcoin-related ETFs. This stringent guideline serves as a crucial benchmark for what Sygnia considers prudent Bitcoin ETF investments , consistently emphasizing the importance of broad diversification over highly concentrated, high-risk bets. Furthermore, the firm has reportedly been making direct warning calls to clients who attempt to exceed these recommended limits, showcasing their hands-on approach to client protection. Navigating the Landscape of Bitcoin ETF Investments: Risks and Rewards The burgeoning accessibility of Bitcoin ETF investments has undoubtedly opened new doors for many traditional investors seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency market. However, this accessibility also brings with it inherent risks that cannot be overlooked. Cryptocurrencies, by their very nature, are renowned for their significant price volatility. This characteristic can lead to impressive gains during bullish periods but also substantial losses during market downturns. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of both the potential rewards and the inherent challenges is absolutely paramount for any investor considering these products. For those venturing into this space, here are some actionable insights: Diversification is Key: It is a golden rule in investing: never concentrate all your capital into a single asset class, especially one as dynamic and volatile as cryptocurrency. Spread your investments across various sectors and asset types. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Before making any significant Bitcoin ETF investments , honestly evaluate your personal comfort level with potential financial losses. Understand that volatility is part of the game. Embrace a Long-Term Vision: Consider Bitcoin and its related ETFs as a long-term asset. Short-term market fluctuations are common and should not dictate panic selling or buying. Stay Informed and Educated: The crypto market is constantly evolving. Continuous learning about market trends, technological advancements, and regulatory changes is vital for making truly informed investment decisions. Consult a Financial Advisor: Professional guidance can provide invaluable insights tailored to your specific financial situation and goals, helping you navigate complex investment choices. What Does Sygnia’s Stance Mean for Your Personal Investment Strategy? Sygnia’s decisive actions serve as a powerful and timely reminder for all investors, from novices to seasoned professionals. While the innovation behind financial products like Bitcoin ETF investments is undoubtedly exciting and offers new avenues for growth, a disciplined, cautious, and well-researched approach remains absolutely essential. Their reported warning calls to clients attempting to make oversized investments vividly underscore the enduring importance of sound financial principles and, where appropriate, professional financial guidance. For individual investors, this means taking a moment to reflect critically on your own portfolio and long-term financial objectives. Are your current allocations truly appropriate for your risk profile? Is your portfolio genuinely diversified across different asset classes? Sygnia’s proactive measures are an invitation to delve deeper into one’s personal investment philosophy, strongly advocating for prudence, foresight, and informed decision-making over impulsive, speculative actions. It’s about building resilient wealth, not just chasing quick gains. A Prudent Path Forward for Bitcoin ETF Investments Sygnia’s intervention in client Bitcoin ETF investments represents a significant and commendable move within the financial industry. It reflects a nuanced understanding of the evolving digital asset landscape—embracing its potential while simultaneously upholding the foundational principles of investor protection and sound financial planning. This approach highlights the critical balance between adopting new investment opportunities and adhering to time-tested financial wisdom. As the cryptocurrency market continues its journey towards maturity, the importance of diversification, measured risk-taking, and informed decision-making will undoubtedly remain paramount for achieving sustained financial health and security.

All USDC/USDT were… pic.twitter.com/fkHwygOHkD — Cyvers Alerts (@CyversAlerts) September 22, 2025 The alert reported that more than $11.3 million worth of assets had been moved under unusual conditions. According to the analysis, an Ethereum address executed a delegateCall, stripped the admin role, and initiated a new command: `addOwnerWithThreshold`. This was followed by transfers of: $4M in Tether (USDT) $500K in USD Coin (USDC) 3.7 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), worth about $230K 25 Ether (ETH), valued at around $75K Funds Moved Across Chains On Ethereum, the attacker swapped all USDC and USDT into DAI. On Arbitrum, the stolen USDT was swapped into ETH and then bridged back to Ethereum. This tactic is consistent with previous on-chain laundering strategies that use decentralized exchanges to obscure transaction trails. Minutes later, another wallet received 10 million UXLINK tokens (~$3M). This address began selling but still retains ~$2.2M worth unswapped at press time, signaling the exploit remains partially active. As of writing, UXLINK (UXLINK) trades at $0.30, with a market cap of $92 million, according to CoinMarketCap. UXLINK Issues Official Response Shortly after the exploit, UXLINK confirmed the breach through an official statement. Urgent Security Notice We have identified a security breach involving our multi-signature wallet, resulting in a significant amount of cryptocurrency being illicitly transferred to both CEXs and DEXs. Our team is working around the clock with both internal and external security… — UXLINK (@UXLINKofficial) September 22, 2025 The team acknowledged that its multi-signature wallet had been compromised, leading to “a significant amount of cryptocurrency being illicitly transferred to both centralized and decentralized exchanges.” The platform said its security and engineering teams are “working around the clock with both internal and external experts” to identify the root cause and limit the attacker’s movements. Coordinating With Exchanges and Authorities UXLINK reported that it has reached out to major CEXs and DEXs to freeze suspicious deposits linked to the stolen funds. The company is coordinating with law enforcement agencies and regulators to accelerate legal recovery efforts. “The incident has been reported to the police and relevant authorities,” the team said. “We remain fully committed to transparency and will continue providing timely updates to the community as new developments arise.” Market Impact and Community Reaction The UXLINK community has voiced concerns on X, with several users calling for immediate compensation plans. Others warned that the breach could impact trust in the project’s security framework, especially as multi-signature wallets are widely used to protect protocol treasuries. While UXLINK tokens faced selling pressure, broader market activity has not shown signs of panic. The project continues to update its users in real time, urging caution against rumors until investigations conclude. Security Risks Remain High This incident underscores ongoing vulnerabilities in Web3 infrastructure. DelegateCall exploits and privilege escalations have been common attack vectors against multi-sig wallets, often allowing attackers to bypass traditional protections. Analysts say the scale of the UXLINK exploit highlights the need for stronger real-time monitoring and rapid freeze protocols between projects and exchanges. What’s Next for UXLINK The immediate priority remains fund recovery and ensuring that further assets cannot be drained. With $11.3M already at risk and $2.2M UXLINK still unswapped, efforts now depend on exchange cooperation and law enforcement actions. For the community, transparency will be key. UXLINK has promised regular updates, but the incident may reshape how investors view the security of project-managed multi-sig wallets. Coinmarketcap data shows the UXLINK token experienced a sharp decline of 50% in few minutes, declining from a high of $0.3 to a current trading price of $0.16.

52135806,https://cryptonews.com/?p=427004,1758612003,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52135806.jpeg,Changpeng Zhao Weighs External Investment For $10B Portfolio in Future: Report,https://cryptonews.com/news/changpeng-zhao-10b-investment-portfolio-considers-external-investors/,"Changpeng Zhao is weighing a future opening of his $10b investment vehicle to outside capital at a later stage, as YZi Labs, the firm spun out of Binance in January, gauges timing and builds out new teams. YZi Labs manages Zhao’s wealth along with funds from a small circle of early Binance executives, including co-founder Yi He. The firm invests primarily in crypto start-ups, while also backing biotech and AI, and previously accepted about $300m from external investors in 2022 before returning part of that money. Chief executive Ella Zhang told the Financial Times that there is steady interest from outside backers and that the firm may convert into an external fund when internal capabilities mature. According to FT, Binance founder CZ’s $10B investment firm YZi Labs is considering opening to external investors and may convert into a public fund. Head Ella Zhang said investor interest is strong but the firm remains in early stages. She noted SEC Chair Paul Atkins requested a… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 23, 2025 She described opening the doors to outside money as a “huge responsibility,” and said the near-term focus is hiring and deepening expertise in AI and biotech. Zhang added that the 12-person team takes a “super long-term” view and is not driven by annual multiple targets, reflecting the scale and horizon of Zhao’s capital. CZ’s Binance Roots Loom Large As YZi Weighs Potential US Capital If YZi Labs eventually admits US investors, the firm would face stricter regulatory scrutiny. That consideration sits alongside a shifting policy landscape, with industry figures pointing to a more accommodative stance toward digital assets in Washington. Zhao, widely known as CZ, co-founded Binance in 2017 and built it into the world’s largest crypto exchange. His majority stake has made him one of the sector’s wealthiest founders, according to public rich lists. The path has not been smooth. In 2023, Zhao pleaded guilty to a US criminal charge related to anti-money laundering controls . Binance entered guilty pleas on money-laundering and sanctions violations and agreed to pay more than $4.3b in penalties. US authorities said the exchange failed to report a large volume of suspicious transactions tied to serious crimes and terrorist groups. SEC Seeks Private Showcase As Founders Drift Back To Silicon Valley Zhao resigned from Binance and served a four-month jail term in 2023. Since completing his sentence, he has sought a presidential pardon in the US. Against that backdrop, Zhang said US regulators have shown fresh interest in portfolio companies. She noted that the SEC requested a private showcase for YZi-backed projects after its chair could not attend a recent demo day at the New York Stock Exchange. Founders who left the US in recent years are returning to Silicon Valley, Zhang said, pointing to an administration that wants to promote the country as a crypto hub. She added that some commissioners appear “open minded” to innovation. Zhao Backs Treasury Structures Using Public Companies For Token Buys Deploying such a large pool of capital is hard. Even so, Zhao has set a clear challenge, put money to work while keeping quality high. As a result, meeting YZi Labs’ criteria across crypto, AI and robotics will take time. Meanwhile, the firm has leaned into crypto treasury structures. It is backing deals that use public companies to raise cash for token purchases. For example, it is pursuing a planned $1b transaction with former Bitmain executives. In July, it also led a raise to convert a Nasdaq-listed vape maker into a BNB-focused treasury vehicle. Finally, digital assets make up about 70% of YZi’s portfolio. However, interest in AI and robotics is rising.

The company also revealed that the credit is backed by its BTC holdings. The Bitcoin miner plans to deploy the $100 million credit into strategic capital expenditures. The investments include expanding the company’s energy portfolio, scaling its Bitcoin mining operations, and investing in high-performance computing (HPC) capabilities. CleanSpark expands its capital strategy We’re proud to deepen our partnership with @CleanSpark_Inc . Through Coinbase Prime, we’re enabling the expansion of their $100M bitcoin-backed credit facility—a bold step in scaling mining operations and advancing crypto’s role in global capital markets. https://t.co/Irxy946U7S — Coinbase Institutional 🛡️ (@CoinbaseInsto) September 22, 2025 Brett Tejpaul, head of Coinbase Institutional, said the firm supports CleanSpark’s innovative approach to expanding its capital strategy. He also believes it’s a step forward for growing the crypto ecosystem through focused capital deployment. Tejpaul also acknowledged that the Coinbase Prime offering delivers robust, secure, and regulated infrastructure alongside industry-leading custody management. The initiative supports institutions as they scale their digital asset strategies. “We are proud to expand our relationship with Coinbase Prime as we continue to add megawatts to our portfolio and take steps toward alternative use cases for some of our data centers.” Matt Schultz , CEO of CleanSpark Schultz noted that there’s a huge opportunity to accelerate mining growth while simultaneously optimizing the company’s assets. He maintained that the initiative will focus on CleanSpark’s assets near major metro centers and in the firm’s immediate pipeline, via the potential development of high-performance campuses. CleanSpark’s CFO and president, Gary Vecchiarelli, wrote in a statement that the company’s core capital strategy is delivering accretive growth using non-dilutive financing. He also maintained that the BTC miner’s “Infrastructure First” strategy has been proven historically. Vecchiarelli hopes CleanSpark’s strategy will enhance shareholder value as the company expands into more diversified compute opportunities. He also mentioned in CleanSpark’s earlier earnings call for its Q2 results that the BTC miner’s balance sheet strategy has matured to an extent that it has allowed the company to pursue non-dilutive funding options that support both its operations and long-term growth. The strategy of using non-dilutive funding options helps a company raise capital without issuing new shares, so existing shareholders don’t lose ownership. Vecchiarelli believes that the strategy represents a strategic distinction from other miners, who he said rely on equity dilution to fund operating costs, while some still rely on increasing leverage to grow their BTC reserves. The company also mined roughly 657 BTC last month, up 38% from the 478 BTC mined in August 2024. CleanSpark also reported an average daily production of 21.20 BTC. At the time of publication, Bitcoin Treasuries data shows that CleanSpark has 12,703 BTC in its balance sheet, worth approximately $1.43 billion. The BTC miner also ranks 10th among corporate Bitcoin treasury companies. CleanSpark’s share price is up 0.88% for the day to $13.74, and has also surged by more than 33% in the past five days. Crypto mining sector shifts to Bitcoin-backed credit CleanSpark had previously secured a $200 million credit from Coinbase Prime in April earlier this year to expand its mining facility. Other Bitcoin miners have also shifted toward using Bitcoin-backed credit as an alternative to equity issuance or direct sales of mined coins. Riot Platforms received a $100 million credit facility from Coinbase in April. The company revealed that the BTC-backed facility is secured by a portion of its Bitcoin holdings and will be used to pursue strategic initiatives. Riot’s CEO Jason Les acknowledged that the firm had entered into its first BTC-backed facility, saying that it provides the company with non-dilutive funding at an attractive cost of financing. The Bitcoin miner revealed that any amount borrowed is subject to annual interest equal to 4.5%. Hut8 also received $50 million in Coinbase’s credit back in 2023. The company also recently announced that it restated and amended its credit facility with Coinbase in January, increasing the principal amount from $15 million to $65 million. Credit lines initiatives have surged as evolving network conditions make mining more capital-intensive. BTC’s hashrate and difficulty hit record highs, while transaction fees dropped below 1% of block rewards last month. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The increase in open interest coincided with a price rise to approximately $3.12 USD, with trading volume also increasing by more than 60%. These developments feed into more bullish XRP scenarios, even as market volatility stalls price action. At the same time, new meme-utility projects like Layer Brett are drawing attention, offering staking rewards and early presale opportunities that appeal to investors seeking the ideal hedge. Signals behind XRP price prediction Recent reports emphasize a resurgence in XRP futures activity, with open interest climbing back above $3 billion USD. Such developments may influence liquidity and market perception, factors often cited in XRP discussions. Meanwhile, latest reports indicate that XRP open interest rose by around 8.6% in just 24 hours, highlighting an increase in leveraged trading. This push followed after the XRP price surged above $3.10 USD, peaking at $3.17 USD before consolidating. These movements strengthen XRP price prediction models pointing toward resistance zones near $3.40–$3.65 USD. Still, analysts caution that if XRP fails to hold support near $3.00 USD, retracement could follow. Layer Brett: The ideal hedge to cushion any downside risks While XRP Price Prediction trends remain significant, the rise of Layer Brett (LBRETT) highlights investors’ urge to maintain a balance between speculative risks and sustainability. In just a few weeks, the Layer Brett project has raised more than $3.9 million USD in presale, with token prices at approximately $0.0058 USD. Built on Ethereum Layer 2 infrastructure, it benefits from faster speeds and lower costs compared to traditional ERC-20 tokens. Its early design includes staking opportunities with reported APYs around 660%, drawing interest from those seeking high-yield exposure. Unlike many meme tokens, Layer Brett incorporates practical features into its tokenomics, giving sustainability against market volatility. Why Layer Brett is seen as one of the best coins to buy now The second area of focus around Layer Brett is its positioning as one of the best coins to buy now. Investors looking for growth potential often see established projects like XRP as assets who have passed their peak stages. In this context, Layer Brett provides significant upside due to its early-stage entry price, capped supply, and high staking rewards. Its Layer 2 foundation also puts it ahead of the regular meme coins. This explains why Layer Brett is gaining traction alongside major assets being tracked under XRP frameworks. Comparative view: XRP vs. Layer Brett XRP offers liquidity, broad recognition, and a regulated path toward institutional adoption. Its price movements are influenced heavily by macroeconomic conditions and large futures positions. In contrast, Layer Brett presents higher and safer potential returns due to its presale phase and staking mechanics. For most investors, holding XRP delivers speculative risk due to market volatility, while allocating to Layer Brett offers a more sustainable path to explosive ROI Conclusion Rising open interest and renewed institutional demand continue to shape XRP price predictions. The near-term targets now stand at $3.40–$3.65 USD and risks centered on the $3.00 USD support level. However, beyond XRP, projects such as Layer Brett highlight where new opportunities may exist, particularly for investors who balance risk with reward. With presale traction, staking incentives, and Layer 2 infrastructure, Layer Brett positions itself as a strong hedge to XRP’s market sentiment.

Dogecoin (DOGE) is still a favorite among community members, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to get swept by retail tidal waves. But the token that is receiving maximum buzz is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently available in presale at $0.035. Unlike the meme-coin giants, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a lending-and-borrowing DeFi protocol geared around actual adoption, so it is the kind of growth play that might offer much faster profits if momentum picks up in the next bull cycle. Dogecoin Fails Against Resistance Following Recent Increase Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at approximately $0.2685, with its price action finding resistance at approximately $0.30 and support around $0.22-$0.25. Its current performance is a repetition of the trend common with memecoins, sudden rallies followed by consolidation. Traders seem cautious, waiting for clear volume and catalyst confirmation before propelling DOGE higher. Unlike DOGE’s trend of fast moves and reversals, Mutuum Finance is being eyed by market analysts as holding more potential for long-term upside under favorable market conditions. Shiba Inu Sees Mixed Signals Amid Retail Interest Shiba Inu (SHIB) is priced at $0.00001303, and recent price action shows limited room to the upside and resistance at $0.00001320, while support is at $0.00001280. Volume has seen moderate gains but has yet to decisively break through resistance, suggesting potential consolidation. Although SHIB’s popularity from its fan base keeps it in the news, its heavy reliance on hype cycles continues to leave it open to volatility. Comparatively, other investors perceive new Mutuum Finance to have greater upside potential in the event of positive adoption and utility trends. Mutuum Finance Growth in Presale Mutuum Finance has gone on a record-breaking presale streak with more than 16,500 investors purchasing coins to raise a cumulative total of more than $16.2 million raised to date. Tokens are available for purchase at $0.035 per MUTM during Phase 6. The presale is tiered, i.e., the early birds get the lower prices. Mutuum Finance’s vision is to progress the horizon of the current DeFi ecosystem. The project has an early bird token giveaway that awards $100,000 MUTM with 10 users being provided with $10,000 MUTM. Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to lend, exchange and settle USD-denominated value of assets trades and token value of assets like ETH, MATIC and AVAX. Fallback oracle modes, composite data feeds and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages are employed as a backup to prevent errors. Multi-layered format supply data price is as accurate as required even in hard-hitting market conditions. Creating a Reliable and Secure Environment Mutuum Finance will introduce a USD stablecoin onto the Ethereum network. Contrary to algorithmic stablecoins that depeg during times of economic downturn, Mutuum’s launched stablecoin will be coined non-algorithmic and overcollateralized and thus is able to sustain its peg during times of financial stress. The model takes advantage of the idle collateral reserve stability to be long-term stable with a guarantee of value preservation. This renders the stablecoin to be a secure depository, and a secure store of value. It also makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the most innovative DeFi projects in the market today. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is head and shoulders above DOGE and SHIB as investors aim for profits in 2025. In Stage 6 of its presale at $0.035, the project has amassed over $16.2M from 16,500+ investors, representing building steam. Unlike DOGE and SHIB that rely on hype cycles, MUTM is building real DeFi infrastructure using a twin lending framework, Chainlink oracle security, and an overcollateralized USD stablecoin for stability. Backed by a $100K token reward and accelerating adoption, MUTM offers utility-driven potential with estimates significantly higher than average meme-coin volatility.

This chart was widely applied to the Bitcoin price as analysts believed that it projected Bitcoin reaching new peaks. So far, the Bitcoin price has already climbed to $124,400 with the money supply chart, and now, analysts are applying the same Global M2 Money Supply chart to the Ethereum price, showing that the altcoin could land at 5-figures soon. What The Global M2 Money Supply Says About Ethereum Price Crypto and market analyst Ted Pillows has taken another route when it comes to predicting the Ethereum price action, and this time, he’s using the Global M2 Money Supply chart. In the X post, the analyst superimposes the Ethereum price chart into the Global M2 Money Supply chart to show how the altcoin has been performing in comparison. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Break Into Double-Digit Rally From This Fibonacci Level The chart shows that the Ethereum price is still lagging behind the money supply chart, but its current position shows it might be ready for another surge. Following the money supply chart would mean that the Ethereum price could see a decline below $4,000, but this is ultimately bullish for the price. This is because of the liquidity that lies at the $4,000 level, and if this liquidity is taken out, then the analyst sees the Ethereum price using this as gunpowder for its next rally. Keeping in line with the Global M2 Money Supply trend, this blowout could lead to an over 300% increase in price. Pillows suggests that the Ethereum price could reach as high as $18,000-$20,000 if this plays out, with a timeline moving into the year 2026. Even in a more conservative stance, the analyst believes that the Ethereum price could trade at half of this target, which would be around $10,000. Ultimately, Pillows believes that Ethereum is still bullish in the long term. The $10,000 Target Pillows is not the only crypto analyst who sees the Ethereum price ultimately reaching the $10,000 target. Another analyst, Titan of Crypto, had previously predicted that Ethereum would ultimately reach $10,000 this year. Titan points to the Bull Pennant formation on the chart, whose breakout would inadvertently put the Ethereum price at the $10,000 target this year if it plays out correctly.

Crypto analyst Donald Dean points out that if the altcoin were to lose support at $4,200, then the next area of major support would lie at $4,070. However, this $4,070 would serve as a launch point if it holds. Once this happens, then the analyst sees the ETH price going on a 50% retracement, and eventually climbing to the $5,766 target as the rally takes hold.

Our Jito price prediction expects the JTO price to record a maximum of $8.56 in 2025. In 2030, we expect the JTO price to achieve $57.27. In December 2023, the Jito (JTO) token airdrop garnered significant attention for the Solana blockchain , which had been facing challenging times. The event also highlighted the importance of liquid staking on Solana while empowering holders to influence platform governance. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Jito price prediction, explored the factors behind these forecasts, and provided insights into the role and utility of the JTO token.

JITO price analysis 1-day chart: JTO price faces bearish pressure toward $1.65 Analyzing the daily price chart of JTO tokens, JITO is struggling to hold momentum as it declined toward $1.65. Currently, sellers are now aiming for a hold below immediate Fib channels. The 24-hour volume declined to $5.3 million, showing a decline in interest in trading today. JITO’s price is currently trading at $1.65, which has dropped by over 1.4% in the last 24 hours. JTO/USDT Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and currently hovers around the 38-level, showing that bears control price momentum.

The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the JITO price from an immediate surge. However, if the JITO price successfully breaks above $1.888, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $2.096. JTO/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, JITO price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.599, resulting in a correction to $1.529. Is Jito a good investment? For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO down today? JTO’s price gained minor selling pressure around local highs, resulting in a downward correction. This created a drop below $1.65. Will the JTO price recover? If buyers hold above the $2 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will the JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment.

One new name that’s been turning heads lately is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) — a meme coin that a Cardano (ADA) trader believes could explode with a 7,500% return by 2025. Too good to be true? This is understandable—crypto has generated a tremendous amount of excitement. Little Pepe seems to be playing differently. Here’s a simple explanation of why investors are concerned. What exactly is Little Pepe? Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is a meme coin, which essentially means it originated as a joke or internet trend — much like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. However, meme coins are no longer just a joke. If they’re built right and attract a solid community, they can become genuine investment opportunities. Little Pepe utilizes the popular Pepe the Frog meme (not a new concept in the internet world), but adds a twist with a crypto spin: a strong community, clear token setup, Ethereum technology, and smart marketing. This isn’t just a funny frog image floating on the blockchain. It’s a coin with serious traction. Why traders are watching it closely Here’s what’s making people — including smart traders in the Cardano space — sit up and look closer: A Super Active Community Little Pepe has built a huge community. We’re talking over 41,000 organic token holders and thousands more chatting every day in their Telegram group. That’s important — because with meme coins, the community is everything. If people believe in the coin, share memes, discuss it on Twitter, and stay engaged, it creates a snowball effect. That’s what happened with Dogecoin. That’s what’s now happening here. 2. Massive Presale Numbers Little Pepe has raised $25.5 million in its presale. That’s not small change. It has sold over 15.7 billion tokens, indicating that many investors already believe it has potential. And when a presale performs well, it often means a strong launch is forthcoming. Some crypto analysts predict that it could surge 20 times at launch, potentially reaching 50 times or even 100 times by 2026, depending on how the roadmap unfolds. Built on Ethereum — Not a Random Chain Little Pepe is built on Ethereum, the second-biggest blockchain in the world. That means: It’s secure It’s scalable It can connect with dApps, DeFi, NFTs, and other Ethereum-based tools Many meme coins operate on questionable chains or lack genuine utility. Little Pepe has the tech backbone to be more than just a meme. Smart Token Design The team behind Little Pepe didn’t just throw a million tokens into the air and hope for the best. They planned the tokenomics to: Limit supply (making it scarce) Reward early holders Avoid price crashes from sudden dumps This type of setup helps the coin remain healthy over time — not just a pump and dump. Big Giveaways & Wild Marketing Ever heard of a $777,000 giveaway? Little Pepe is running one at the moment. They’re not shy about grabbing attention — meme contests, influencer shoutouts, viral tweets — they’re using every trick in the book to keep the spotlight on. That’s huge, because in crypto, attention = money. But can it really go 75x? Here’s why some people believe a 7,500% gain is possible (even if it’s not guaranteed): Meme Power Works: Remember when Dogecoin jumped thousands of percent because Elon Musk tweeted about it? Or how Shiba Inu went from nothing to billion-dollar market cap in months? It happens. Scarcity Drives Price: With limited tokens and high demand, prices typically rise. Tech + Hype = Strong Combo: Little Pepe isn’t just hype. It has the Ethereum foundation and smart planning behind it. Presale Already Proves Interest: If people are willing to invest $25.5 million before launch, chances are they’ll continue to support it. Why Cardano traders are interested You might wonder: why are Cardano (ADA) fans into a meme coin like this? Cardano traders are accustomed to identifying value early. They bought into ADA when it was under 5 cents, believing in the long-term vision. Little Pepe, even though it’s a meme coin, has some of the same early signals: Clear roadmap Smart contract use Real community Early growth signs Cardano fans are not just tech lovers — they’re also value hunters. And they know that sometimes, the biggest winners look like jokes at first. Final thoughts Little Pepe isn’t just a meme anymore. It’s becoming a real contender in the cryptocurrency world. With a huge presale, strong Ethereum technology, a clear token strategy, and a passionate community, it has a real shot at significant growth — possibly even 7,500% by 2025, as some are predicting. But here’s the bottom line: if you missed Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, and you’re hunting for what could be the next big meme coin, Little Pepe is one to watch.

Ethereum, Solana, and many altcoins have seen sharp declines of over 6%. This shift in prices has caught the attention of traders and market watchers. It raises new questions about what could happen next for the largest cryptocurrency and its smaller rivals. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.0055 Next Stage: $0.0056 Listing Price: $0.1 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Bitcoin's Halving Countdown: Will Scarcity Spark the Next Rally? Bitcoin is the first digital coin with no boss. A shared ledger sits on many computers, so no bank can shut it down. People send coins straight to each other, day or night. Miners guard the ledger by cracking math puzzles; the network pays them new coins for the work. Only 21 million can ever exist, and the payout falls in half every four years. This rule keeps the system tight and fake-proof. Many see bitcoin as online gold. It has lasted longer than any rival, proving its code and brand. Newer coins offer flash, but they also bring bugs and big shifts. Bitcoin feels slow, yet its simple plan of scarcity never changes. Past cycles show prices often climb as each payout cut nears, then swing wild afterward. With mainstream funds lining up and supply growth shrinking, the old coin still looks lively in the present market sprint. Ethereum's Next Leap: Riding the Path to 2030 Ethereum began as Vitalik Buterin’s idea in 2013 and went live in 2015. It lets people run smart contracts and build apps that cut out middlemen. The network swapped to Proof-of-Stake in 2022, trimming energy use and paying rewards to stakers. Ether fuels every action, from moving ERC-20 tokens to trading on DeFi. Busy times push fees up, so Layer 2 tools like Arbitrum and Polygon batch transactions and speed things up. Next comes sharding, which will split data into smaller parts and make the chain faster and cheaper. Prices tell a story too. Using past moves and the Bitcoin halving rhythm, watchers place next year’s floor near $2,700 and a ceiling near $6,580. They then chart a steady climb: highs of about $7,500 in 2026, $9,000 in 2027, $11,000 in 2028, $13,000 in 2029, and $15,000 in 2030, with lows staying well above today’s marks. Compared with many newer coins, ETH has the biggest builder base and the most cash locked in apps. If the wider market shifts back to growth, its mix of fresh tech and long-standing trust makes it look hard to ignore. Solana Surge: Speed Meets Crypto Growth Solana is a network built for fast moves. It gives makers of apps a roomy base without slicing data into tiny parts. That means more work can happen at once. Many languages plug in, so coders feel at home. Its coin, SOL, acts as ticket, fuel, and prize. Users pay fees with it, run special programs, and earn rewards for securing the chain. Think of Ethereum or Cardano as rivals on the same track; Solana races ahead by skipping extra layers and keeping all parts in one lane. The market now favors coins that can carry heavy traffic. Meme coins fade, yet real-world use shines. SOL fits this trend. It handled huge NFT drops and lively trading without blinking, a point some older chains still chase. Prices have climbed from last year’s lows, yet they sit below past peaks, leaving room to run if the next bull wave hits. If high speed, busy apps, and diverse tools matter, SOL looks set to draw fresh eyes in the coming cycle. Conclusion BTC stays firm, ETH and SOL remain sound despite dips. Attention shifts to XYZVerse (XYZ), the sports memecoin aiming to eclipse PEPE and MOG through community power, GameFi, and partnerships.

But turning $2,500 into $1,000,000 through these older giants may take a long time. A new project, Little Pepe , is already showing signs it could get there in half the time, with a presale that has shocked even veteran investors. At the time of writing, the presale is in Stage 13, priced at $0.0022. That leaves room for a 400x rise to $0.88, which could flip $2,500 into $1,000,000. Cardano (ADA): The visionary builder Cardano, known as “the academic blockchain,” has always been about building slow and steady. It has smart contracts, staking, and a loyal community. At the time of writing, the price of ADA is around $0.91. For ADA to turn $2,500 into $1,000,000, it must climb to roughly $360. With its current market cap already in the tens of billions, such growth would likely take many years. Cardano is reliable, but it does not move quickly. Ripple (XRP): The cross-border pioneer Ripple has long been branded as “the bridge for global payments.” At the time of writing, XRP trades at about $3.08. It has carved out a role in banking and cross-border settlements, especially after its partial regulatory win in the United States. But here is the challenge: for XRP to turn $2,500 into $1,000,000, the coin must hit over $1,200. Even with strong partnerships, that target looks very far away. Investors may enjoy steady returns, but not the explosive kind that creates instant millionaires. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The meme coin with real utility This is where Little Pepe changes the story. Tagged as “the meme coin with a backbone,” it combines cultural energy with actual blockchain use cases. At the time of writing, the presale has raised over $25,624,175, with 15,817,805,940 tokens sold out of 17,250,000,000. The current stage offers tokens at $0.0022. Early-stage buyers have already seen gains of 120%, and even at Stage 13, investors can still capture 36.36% upside by launch when the token is expected to list at $0.0030. What sets LILPEPE apart from classic meme coins is its foundation. It is audited by Certik, already listed on CoinMarketCap, and built on an efficient Layer 2 network. The project promises zero tax transactions, staking rewards, and a launchpad for future meme projects. These are the kinds of fundamentals that push a coin from hype to lasting value. Why LILPEPE could outrun ADA and XRP The real difference is scale. ADA and XRP are established giants with large market caps. That makes exponential growth much more complicated. LILPEPE, starting from a presale price of $0.0022, has far more room to expand. If it hits $0.88 in the future, that is a 400x rise, which is enough to turn $2,500 into $1,000,000. It could happen in half the time it takes ADA or XRP to reach their equivalent growth levels. Another point worth noting is cultural momentum. From June to August 2025, LILPEPE ranked higher than PEPE, Dogecoin, and SHIB in ChatGPT 5 search volumes. The team has also launched a $777k giveaway and a Mega Giveaway with over 15 ETH in prizes for top presale buyers from Stage 12 to Stage 17. Final thoughts Little Pepe offers the possibility of reaching that milestone in half the time, with a mix of cultural energy and real blockchain utility. When writing, the presale is nearing the $28 million target, the price is $0.0022, and Stage 13 is 91.70% filled. For those who believe in early entry and exponential growth, this could be the chance to catch the next breakout before it leaves the station.

However, there’s one major challenge that’s preventing its widespread use in these scenarios – the total lack of privacy it provides. For instance, blockchain can help to make medical records more secure by eliminating single points of failure, but this will never happen if it’s not possible to safeguard each patient’s sensitive data. Blockchain-based voting is also said to be superior because it’s more resistant to fraud, but this doesn’t do much good if it means that no one can vote anonymously, in-line with democratic principles. That explains why there’s a lot of buzz and excitement around the emergence of privacy-preserving blockchain projects such as COTI, Zama and Midnight. They’re the pioneers of innovative cryptographic techniques that enable blockchain transactions to be obscured, yet remain fully verifiable. If these techniques take off, they could pave the way for a new wave of private blockchain applications spanning everything from payroll to voting to investing and more. How Privacy Brings Blockchain To Life When blockchains are able to maintain transaction privacy, they suddenly become extremely useful in a wide range of applications that have traditionally relied on centralized systems. In fact, almost any kind of transaction-related process can benefit from cutting out the middleman, and if privacy can be guaranteed, there’s every reason to consider using blockchain rather than legacy systems. To prove this point, let’s look at a few examples of privacy-preserving blockchains in action. 1: Confidential Compensation Payroll systems are a sensitive thing for most companies. In almost every industry there’s a need to ensure employees’ payments and salaries are processed efficiently and securely in a system that allows every payment to be recorded and tracked. Blockchain is perfect for this, of course, but the challenge it faces is that most salaries are confidential, and workers will not accept that everyone in the world can look and see how much they’re being paid. That’s why very few companies in the world are ever likely to start paying employees’ wages in Bitcoin. But there’s no reason that they can’t use a network like COTI instead. COTI has developed a privacy-preserving payments network that utilizes Garbled Circuits, which is a cryptographic mechanism that enables two parties to compute transactions, even though each one only has access to part of the data. This ensures that transaction details remain confidential. Payroll systems do require some transparency, though, so that companies can keep track of payments and ensure salaries were paid on time. Fortunately, COTI supports this because it allows for “selective disclosure” of some data, where users can choose to share it with select parties. While COTI is far from exclusively focused on payroll, its architecture is perfectly capable of facilitating enterprise-grade payments that remain hidden from public view, yet auditable by the company itself. By using COTI’s infrastructure to process salary payments on-chain, enterprises can ensure that every employee is paid quickly and efficiently, with lower costs and full auditability. 2: Securing Medial Records Few industries have stricter privacy requirements than healthcare. Organizations have a legal obligation to ensure that medical records remain private, and this is the foundation of trust between patients and doctors. Blockchain can provide many advantages in terms of managing healthcare records. Its decentralization reduces the risk of data breaches, and supports interoperability between different healthcare systems, but the need for privacy has so far prevented its widespread adoption. One very compelling solution to this challenge is Midnight’s Layer-2 blockchain network, which is focused on the idea of “rational privacy”. Built on Cardano, Midnight utilizes a technique known as zero knowledge-proofs to protect sensitive information. With ZK-proofs, one party can show proof that they know the validity of a statement or transaction, without revealing the specific details of that statement or transaction. This means ZK-proofs can be used to demonstrate the validity of transactions without exposing the details. In the context of healthcare, Midnight’s blockchain can be used to tokenize medical records and store them securely on its public ledger. Other users will be able to see that the records exist and have been verified, but they cannot know the details of those records. Access to the tokenized records is managed by smart contracts, which means that only authorized users, such as a doctor, can view them. Alternatively, Midnight would allow for patients to verify their eligibility for a specific medical treatment, without having to reveal their full medical histories. It also opens up the possibility for hospitals to share anonymized data. That means researchers would be able to query aggregated and encrypted medical datasets and analyze them, without being able to access patient’s identities, ensuring that strict privacy regulations aren’t breached. 3: Tamper-Proof Voting Anonymous, free and fair elections are the foundation of any democracy, yet there have been concerns raised about the potential for manipulation using paper-based and electronic voting systems. A transparent, blockchain-based ledger is the perfect countermeasure to vote rigging and tampering, but only if it supports voting in secret. By combining blockchain transparency with Fully Homomorphic Encryption, it’s possible to satisfy all of these democratic requirements. Zama is a company that’s building FHE systems that can be utilized by any blockchain. With FHE, it becomes possible to perform computations directly on encrypted information, without needing to decrypt it first, and this has useful implications for voting. In blockchain-based voting systems, the electorate can cast its votes privately and encrypt them prior to submitting them, so that no one knows who they voted for. Then, the votes can be tallied while remaining fully encrypted. The system would be able to identify exactly how many votes were received by each candidate, but it wouldn’t be able to tell you which one a particular individual voted for. As such, the outcome of the election can be determined fairly, without any risk of manipulation, while every vote remains secret. The main advantage of such a system is that it eliminates the need for trusted third parties to count up the votes at polling stations. With Zama’s technology, it’s possible to create a blockchain voting system that’s encrypted at all times, with only the final vote count being revealed once all ballots have been cast. 4: Private DeFi Lending Decentralized finance built on the blockchain is a gamechanger, enabling new kinds of financial applications such as peer-to-peer lending that doesn’t rely on credit scoring. DeFi, as it’s also called, has gotten a lot of interest from businesses and financial institutions looking to diversify their investments, but many of them are highly regulated and have closely guarded secrets that they cannot afford to disclose due to competitive concerns. Privacy-preserving blockchains like COTI and Midnight provide different ways for DeFi transactions to be obscured while verifying that they are valid, creating opportunities for businesses to engage in confidential on-chain activities such as borrowing, lending and trading. For instance, COTI’s confidential payment rails can be used by businesses to engage with DeFi protocols without worrying about revealing their financial strategies. At the same time, COTI’s selective disclosure features mean those organizations can remain compliant while doing so. This makes DeFi far more accessible to big businesses, so they can deposit capital in liquidity pools to earn DeFi yield, lend funds for the interest repayments, or engage in complex leveraged trading strategies without their competitors knowing. Privacy Removes A Key Barrier To Adoption Advocates of blockchain will accept nothing less than total domination of the world’s financial ecosystem, and the emergence of privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques makes that dream much more realistic than it was just a few years ago. With private transactions, blockchain is now viable in dozens of industries that would have previously rejected it out of hand. This shows that privacy is not just something that’s nice to have. In fact, it’s an absolute necessity if the technology is to achieve the widespread adoption its proponents yearn for. Blockchain still has a long way to go before it achieves that, but the ability to transact in private removes one of the major obstacles in its path to global supremacy.",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TECHNOLOGY|WALLET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-23 07:40:00

The key safety issue is the ability of users to still move funds, even if the L2 stopped working. Vitalik Buterin spoke out on the key feature of L2 decentralization. While for some the issue is frivolous, Buterin explained L2s are not “glorified servers” sending transactions to Ethereum. Instead, the chains allow users to move their funds in a permissionless way, even if the L2 stops working. The feature is seen as key to awarding L2s decentralized status, and avoids potential losses in the case a chain decides to close. Buterin explained that L2s are non-custodial, and in the end cannot censor transactions, as it happened briefly on the Soneium chain. Base is doing things the right way: an L2 on top of Ethereum, that uses its centralized features to provide stronger UX features, while still being tied into Ethereum’s decentralized base layer for security. Base does not have custody over your funds, they cannot steal funds or… https://t.co/0EMdThg4gU — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) September 22, 2025 This level of security, however, still does not exclude financial risk, and cannot guarantee the safety of DEXs. The only achievement is that the DEX is not a custodian of funds. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, Buterin is focusing again on L2 and their interaction with Ethereum. In December, Ethereum will also increase its capacity for L2 transactions, further boosting speed and lowering costs. Are L2s capable of grabbing user funds? Armani Ferrante, founder of the Backpack wallet and DEX, mentioned that in some cases, margin trading may require a form of custody and funds that are briefly locked by a third party, to achieve trading. Ferrante, who was an early hire of Alameda Research, aims to dispel fears of custodial overstepping and harming the rights of depositors. Sunil Kavuri, FTX creditor activist, warned that not all trading was the same, as in the case of Alameda Research, which directly grabbed and used deposits to FTX. So far, there is no data of a L2 chain being able to control user funds to a high extent, repeating the model of Alameda Research. Ethereum’s infrastructure still allows censorship-free, direct movements of L2 tokens. Jesse Pollak, founder of Base, explained the chain’s sequencer. He stated the Base sequencer works as a fast lane, but users were free to order Base transactions directly on Ethereum, with no censorship. This pathway to transacting may take longer to settle in some cases, suggesting sequencers can still affect some transactions, as users will have to accept delays. L2 chains keep expanding activity L2 chains keep expanding their activity, with 35% in value growth for the past year. As of September, the chains secure $54.9B in value, moving close to the previous all-time peak in late 2024. L2 chains post near-peak value and record activity. Vitalik Buterin once again reiterated that decentralization is a safety issue, to avoid centralized transaction censorship. | Source: L2Beat . Base is also achieving new milestones, securing over $14.92B in value. The chain carries over $4B in stablecoins, through its native USDC. However, Arbitrum is once again the venue for bridged stablecoins, expanding from 4.9B to 9.33B in dollar-pegged tokens, including USDT , USDC, and other assets. Overall, the stablecoin supply on top L2 chains is near an all-time high, based on demand for lending and trading.

Each is moving with its own pace and pattern, standing out amid the downturn. Which coin is weathering the pullback best, and what trends set them apart? A closer look shows unexpected shifts in direction and strength. HBAR: The Green Speedster Racing Past Old Blockchains Hedera Hashgraph works like a busy chat room where every message is logged in order. This design, called hashgraph, skips the slow crunch of mining seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Without heavy machines, the network stays light on energy, keeps fees tiny, and can handle many trades at once. Its coin, HBAR, pays those fees and protects the system because users lock up tokens to vote on updates. The result is a fast, green, and low-cost way to run apps and smart deals. Right now, markets crave speed, low fees, and eco-friendly stories. HBAR fits that mood, and big firms on its council add weight. Still, its code is patented, so open-source fans may look elsewhere, and rival staking coins like Solana and Avalanche fight for the same space. After last year’s hard reset, many mid-cap tokens are bouncing as traders hunt fresh themes. If the wider rally holds, HBAR’s clear use case and strong brand could draw new buyers. Yet true breakout will hinge on real-world apps choosing hashgraph over classic chains in the months ahead. From Telegram Dream to DeFi Star: Why Toncoin May Steal the Spotlight Toncoin runs The Open Network, a public, open-source blockchain first built by Telegram. When regulators halted the original “Gram,” fans refused to quit. The non-profit TON Foundation took over, tuned the code, and kept the name alive. The network uses proof of stake, so holders lock coins to help run it. This design lets TON move data fast, cut fees, and stay green. Builders plan more than payments. They work on storage, web names, private links, and tools that talk to each other with ease. Money watchers say the buzz could last. Charts that follow Bitcoin’s four-year rhythm hint at wide price swings: lows of $6.45 and highs of $30.30 in 2025, then $16.06 to $26.04 by 2030. Even the lower 2030 guess beats today’s level by a lot. While giants like Ethereum fight traffic jams, TON still cruises. If fresh apps land and trading mood stays bright, Toncoin may turn from sleeper pick to headline act in the next cycle. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $15 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.0055. At the next stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.0056, meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Litecoin: Digital Silver Racing Ahead of Bitcoin's Slow Gold Litecoin was born in 2011 when former Google coder Charlie Lee wanted a quicker Bitcoin. It adds a new block every two and a half minutes, so money moves fast. Its code lets many users join mining, not only big firms, which keeps the network open. With 84 million coins on tap, four times more than Bitcoin, fans call it “digital silver.” People use it for coffee, game items, and other small buys because its fees stay low. The team keeps tuning the engine. In 2022 they added an upgrade called MWEB that hides amounts and cuts extra data, making transfers both lighter and more private. This fresh paint helps Litecoin stand out in a crowd of new tokens. Today, rising costs on Bitcoin and the buzz around speedy chains give Litecoin a tailwind. It is listed on almost every exchange, so traders hop in and out with ease. While it may not soar as high as some hot meme coins, its long record, clear goal, and active updates offer a solid bet for the next market wave. Conclusion HBAR, TON, and LTC remain solid performers ahead of the 2025 bull run; yet the standout is XYZVerse (XYZ), a sport-meme token marrying fandom and GameFi, targeting outsized early-presale gains.

Jamie Dimon, who made moderate statements about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, lastly spoke about stablecoins and FED interest rate cuts. Speaking to CNBC, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said that stablecoins are not a threat to bank deposits. Dimon stated that he is not worried about stablecoins, but that the banking sector is not ready for it yet and needs to understand stablecoin technology and prepare for commercialization. Dimon noted that there is strong demand abroad for holding US dollars in stablecoin form, adding that JPMorgan is also involved in stablecoin-related activities and is considering establishing a consortium. The JPMorgan CEO also touched on the issue of Fed interest rate cuts. Dimon stated that the Fed would have difficulty lowering interest rates. Dimon added that the Fed is unlikely to cut interest rates further, noting that high inflation remains a concern. “If inflation doesn't fall, it will be difficult for the Fed to cut interest rates further. “Inflation seems to be stuck at 3%. At this point, I think inflation will trend upwards, not downwards.” According to CME FedWatch, which is based on futures trader expectations, the probability of a 25 basis point rate cut at the October and December meetings is priced in at about 90% and 75%, respectively. *This is not investment advice.

52137140,586831,1758614438,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,Coinbase And Binance Accused Of Relying On ‘Flawed Software’ By Industry Expert,https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-and-binance-accused-of-flawed-software/,"In a provocative social media post on X (previously Twitter), market expert MartyParty has raised alarm bells, claiming that two of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (COIN) and Binance, are engaged in a fierce competition that allegedly threatens the integrity of the sector. According to the expert, the roots of this so-called “conflict” may be traced back to claimed fundamental weaknesses in their technology choices, which are said to have serious ramifications for the future of decentralized finance (DeFi). Centralization And Weak Tech MartyParty argues that Coinbase’s decision to utilize Ethereum (ETH)—a platform he characterizes as fundamentally weak—has led to further complications. He criticizes the exchange for opting for a Layer 2 solution that he believes undermines the foundational principles of Web3. This, he contends, creates a fragile ecosystem that is not equipped to support the scalability and security that decentralized finance demands. On the other hand, Binance has taken a different approach by forking Ethereum to create its own Binance Chain. However, MartyParty claims that this strategy is equally flawed, as it relies on a centralized server infrastructure that lacks a robust security model . He points out that both platforms are limited in their transaction processing capabilities, capping out at a mere 200 transactions per second. According to him, these shortcomings should have been addressed long ago, yet both companies continue to build upon what he deems a fundamentally broken software architecture. Expert Warns Of Manipulation The broader implications of these issues extend beyond mere technology. MartyParty asserts that both Coinbase and Binance are effectively controlling the market landscape, operating in a “regulatory vacuum” that allows practices like wash trading to flourish. This unregulated environment, he argues, gives them significant influence over pricing in dollar terms across the crypto spectrum, enabling them to manipulate market perceptions and mislead investors. At the heart of this situation is a critical philosophical question: Can trust be restored in a financial system that is increasingly centralized? MartyParty emphasizes that the promise of cryptocurrency lies in its ability to use cryptography and the principles of Moore’s Law to create a new era of trust and global finance. He posits that neither Coinbase nor Binance is equipped to contribute to this vision, as their operations are rooted in centralized practices that prioritize profit over the foundational ethos of permissionless finance. Coinbase-Binance Rivalry MartyParty’s critique extends to the nature of competition within the tech industry , drawing parallels to historical giants like Oracle and Microsoft, which he argues have often engaged in practices that prioritize corporate gain over genuine innovation. He warns that the current struggle between Coinbase and Binance mirrors these past conflicts, where the focus is less on technological advancement and more on leveraging narratives to gain market dominance. The path forward, according to MartyParty, hinges on a commitment to authenticity and decentralization, steering clear of the pitfalls that have historically plagued corporate giants.

Their downturn outpaced the broader market, knocking each token to multi-week lows and wiping hundreds of millions of dollars from combined valuations. Analysts attribute the retreat to thinning liquidity, a stronger dollar and profit-taking after recent rallies in higher-cap coins. Trading desks reported heavier sell-side volumes during the Asian session, while derivatives funding rates flipped negative, signaling more traders positioning for further downside. Dogecoin and (DOGE) Pressed Between Support and Hopes of Rally Dogecoin began in 2013 when software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer released a playful peer to peer coin that sports a Shiba Inu logo. The project runs on a Litecoin based code with faster blocks, Scrypt mining, and no cap on supply, which keeps new coins flowing. Fans range from online communities to high profile figures such as Elon Musk, and the token has funded causes from a bobsled team to water wells. The mix of humor, speed, and a loyal base gives the coin lasting attention in the wider crypto market. With that backdrop, the latest market data draws new attention. Source: TradingView DOGE now trades between 0.25 and 0.28 after sliding 13.84 percent in the past week, flatlining at minus 0.21 percent over a month, yet still ahead by 26.06 percent across six months. Market signals show pressure: the 10 day average sits near 0.25 while the 100 day line is higher at 0.27, the relative strength index is at 25.21, and the stochastic reading is 24.59, all pointing to an oversold mood. Sellers hold sway while the MACD remains negative at minus 0.0068. The nearest support rests at 0.24 with a deeper floor at 0.21, while buyers eye resistance at 0.30 and then 0.33. A bounce from oversold levels could lift the price by about 15 percent toward the first ceiling, yet a break under 0.24 risks a slide of roughly 10 percent to the lower band. For now the coin sits in a tight range, waiting for a spark that decides whether the next move is a rebound or a fresh dip. $ZX Token on Altcoin Rally Watch as Zexpire Adoption Accelerates Every cycle has that one token that nobody paid attention to — until it 100×, 500×, even 1000×. This time, $ZX could be it. The reason is simple: it powers Zexpire, the first platform that lets traders earn directly from volatility — crypto's biggest challenge. Zexpire strips trading down to one click: Will BTC stay in range or break out today? Make your call, click the button, and wait for the outcome. This binary format doubles the odds of being right compared to traditional trading. Besides, the risks are fixed. You can't lose more than you stake. No margin calls. No liquidations. Just a fast way to play daily volatility — the kind of simplicity that hooks users by the thousands. That's why adoption potential for Zexpire is high — and adoption directly drives demand for $ZX. So here is why Zexpire's $ZX could explode: Adoption driver: To place a bet, you need to buy a ticket with $ZX, so the higher adoption of the platform naturally drives the demand for ZX. Ground-floor pricing: starting at just $0.003 with a built-in climb to $0.025 on initial funding phase (nearly 8× upside before listing). Deflationary design: Zexpire plans 20% fee burns and buybacks that can tighten float as activity grows. Zero to Hero: Why Pocket $ZX Now? We've seen this before. Tokens go from ""unknown"" to ""unmissable"" once their stickiness draws in users. $ZX is at that very stage now. It's the token behind a brand-new trading platform that enables you to earn from wild crypto volatility with just one click. The early access window won't last. Each stage raises the price, and early birds are already securing $ZX at the lowest levels. Be among the first - get your $ZX Now Cardano and (ADA) signals new moves amid mixed market mood Cardano launched in 2017 as a proof-of-stake chain that aims for speed, security, and low energy use. Its Ouroboros system lets holders stake ADA while cutting the power draw linked to proof-of-work rivals. The network was built on peer-reviewed research and positions itself as a home for apps and smart contracts. ADA serves as the unit for fees, transfers, and staking rewards, and its design targets both everyday users and developers. These traits set the stage for a close look at today’s market action. Source: TradingView The coin now trades between $0.85 and $0.93 after sliding 7.43% in a week and 11.80% in a month, although it still sits 10.19% higher than six months ago. Short-term pressure shows in a 10-day average near $0.85 and a weak momentum reading below 20, yet the 100-day average at $0.90 and support at $0.81 have contained deeper losses. If buyers push past the first barrier at $0.98, a break toward $1.06 would add roughly 19% from current levels; failure to hold $0.81 could open a dip to $0.72, a fall of about 15%. With the price oversold but momentum still negative, ADA looks set for a near-term tug-of-war before a possible rebound toward the dollar mark. Arbitrum and (ARB) eye recovery after sharp pullback Arbitrum is built by Offchain Labs. It is a Layer-2 scaling network for Ethereum. The goal is faster transactions, more capacity, and added privacy. The system uses optimistic rollups to boost smart contract speed and cut cost. ARB is the network’s governance coin. Holders vote on upgrades and guide growth. The first supply was 10 billion coins and inflation can rise by up to 2 % a year. Tokens went to investors, DAOs, user wallets, a DAO treasury, and the team. The Arbitrum DAO can change those shares later. These design points set the scene for today’s market action. Source: TradingView ARB now trades between $0.46 and $0.52. The price sank 14.21 % in the past week and 24.86 % over a month, yet it is still 11.96 % higher than 6 months ago. The 10-day moving average of $0.46 sits below the 100-day mark of $0.50, showing near-term weakness. The relative strength index reads 18.3, which signals an oversold market. Support sits at $0.44 and deeper support at $0.38. Resistance stands at $0.55 and next at $0.61. A break above the first ceiling would mean a gain of about 10 % and could push toward $0.61 for a 20 % rise. If support fails, a slide to $0.38 would cut about 15 %. Oversold readings and steady support suggest the next move may tilt upward toward $0.55. Conclusion DOGE, ADA and ARB posted the sharpest drops in the mid- and low-cap bracket today. The pullback followed thin trading and a firm dollar. Market depth dried up, sending bids lower and widening spreads. Even so, each coin still holds active teams and steady user bases. Their tech road maps remain on track, suggesting room for recovery once sentiment turns. While these tokens work through selling pressure, Zexpire flips the very cause of that pressure into profit. The platform lets users make one click to say if Bitcoin will stay in a range or break out on the day. Losses stop at the stake, with no margin calls or forced sales. Each round runs on $ZX, the fuel that powers fees, discounts, and buybacks. Buying $ZX now means early entry into a token wired for constant demand. It represents a promising opportunity too.

A notable development involves a significant Space ID token transfer , specifically 20 million ID tokens, valued at approximately $3.064 million. This substantial movement of assets to an address linked with YZi Labs sparks important questions about strategic investments and future project directions in the Web3 space. What Does This Space ID Token Transfer Reveal About YZi Labs? According to diligent on-chain analysis by ai_9684xtpa, Space ID (ID) recently executed a considerable Space ID token transfer to YZi Labs. For those unfamiliar, YZi Labs holds a crucial position as a seed investor in Space ID. Interestingly, YZi Labs was previously known as Binance Labs, a prominent venture capital arm in the crypto ecosystem. This background adds an extra layer of significance to their actions. Since September 2024, YZi Labs has been actively accumulating ID tokens, bringing their total holdings to an impressive 100 million tokens. This consistent accumulation by a major investor, especially one with a history tied to Binance, often signals strong conviction in the project’s long-term potential. Such moves are not arbitrary; they are usually part of a carefully planned investment strategy. Why Are Space ID Token Transfers to Key Investors So Important? Any large-scale Space ID token transfer to a significant investor like YZi Labs warrants close observation. These movements can offer valuable insights into the health and future trajectory of a project. Here’s why such transfers matter: Investor Confidence: A major seed investor increasing their stake demonstrates strong belief in Space ID’s vision and development roadmap. It can reassure other investors about the project’s viability. Strategic Positioning: Accumulating a substantial amount of tokens allows YZi Labs to have a more influential voice in governance or strategic decisions, potentially guiding Space ID towards shared goals. Market Signal: Large transfers can be interpreted by the market as a bullish signal, suggesting that insiders or major backers see untapped value. Tokenomics Impact: While these tokens are held by an investor, their movement and accumulation can indirectly affect the circulating supply dynamics and overall market perception of ID tokens. Understanding these underlying motivations helps paint a clearer picture of the broader market sentiment surrounding Space ID and its ecosystem. It’s not just about the monetary value; it’s about the strategic implications. How Does This Space ID Token Transfer Impact the Broader Crypto Landscape? The implications of this Space ID token transfer extend beyond just Space ID and YZi Labs. Space ID is a decentralized identifier (DID) protocol, playing a vital role in the Web3 identity infrastructure. As Web3 continues to evolve, robust and user-friendly identity solutions become increasingly critical. An investor of YZi Labs’ caliber deepening its commitment to Space ID could catalyze further interest and investment in the broader DID sector. It validates the importance of digital identity in the decentralized future. This specific transfer, therefore, serves as a micro-event with macro potential, potentially influencing trends in blockchain identity solutions and how venture capital interacts with promising Web3 projects. What Should Space ID Holders Know About This Recent Token Transfer? For current and prospective Space ID token holders, understanding the nature of this Space ID token transfer is key. While YZi Labs’ accumulation is a positive sign of investor confidence, it’s always prudent to consider the full picture. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Continue to monitor official announcements from Space ID and keep an eye on on-chain analytics for further significant movements. Research YZi Labs: Learn more about YZi Labs’ investment thesis and their past successes to better gauge their strategy with Space ID. Evaluate Tokenomics: Understand the overall token distribution, vesting schedules, and circulating supply of ID tokens to make informed decisions. This transfer underscores the dynamic nature of the crypto market, where investor actions can provide valuable clues about a project’s perceived value and future prospects. It highlights the ongoing strategic plays by major players in shaping the decentralized future. In conclusion, the recent Space ID token transfer of $3.1 million to YZi Labs is more than just a transaction; it’s a strategic move by a significant seed investor. This action by YZi Labs, with its deep roots in the crypto investment world, reinforces confidence in Space ID’s vision and its pivotal role in the Web3 identity landscape. As Space ID continues its journey, the strategic backing from such key players will undoubtedly play a crucial role in its development and market positioning. Keeping an eye on these foundational movements helps us better understand the evolving narrative of promising crypto projects. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Space ID (ID)?

The transfer of 20 million ID tokens to YZi Labs is likely part of YZi Labs’ ongoing accumulation strategy as a seed investor. It could be related to investment agreements, strategic partnerships, or simply YZi Labs increasing its stake in Space ID due to strong conviction in the project’s future. 4. How do large token transfers affect a cryptocurrency’s market? Large token transfers, especially to known investors, can influence market sentiment. They can be seen as a vote of confidence, potentially leading to increased buying interest. Conversely, large transfers to exchanges might suggest selling pressure. In this case, accumulation by a long-term investor is generally viewed positively. 5. What is the significance of YZi Labs accumulating 100 million ID tokens? YZi Labs’ accumulation of 100 million ID tokens indicates a substantial, long-term commitment to Space ID. As a major investor, their large holdings give them a vested interest in the project’s success and potentially a stronger voice in its strategic direction, reinforcing its stability and growth prospects.

XRP is trading above $2.71; analysts expect $3.60 to $4.80 if support continues holding. Bearish signals point to $2.07 if the current triangle pattern breaks; the market remains cautious despite ETF success. Large XRP Holders Accumulate During Price Pullback Ripple wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million coins increased their holdings from 6.74 billion to 6.77 billion XRP in the last 24 hours. This reflects a net growth of roughly 30 million XRP, according to Ali Martinez. 30 million $XRP bought by whales in the past 24 hours! pic.twitter.com/DVWZyalNAC — Ali (@ali_charts) September 22, 2025 This activity came as XRP’s price moved down to $2.84. Buying during a pullback has been seen before and has often marked early stages of upward price movements. During the same session, whale wallets moved around $812 million in XRP between unidentified addresses, as reported by Whale Alert. Such movements tend to raise attention, especially during periods of low volatility or declining prices. At press time, XRP was trading at $2.87. This marks a slight drop in the last 24 hours and a 4% decline over the past week. While the price has cooled off, some traders continue to watch nearby support zones. According to Martinez, “$XRP holding above $2.71 could open the door for a move to $3.60.” The chart shows repeated bounces from this level, making it a short-term floor for buyers. Above it, resistance sits at $3.2 and $3.6. So far, the $2.71 mark has held through multiple tests. As long as it stays intact, further attempts to climb may follow. Source: Ali Martinez/X Long-Term Setup Still Active Javon Marks has pointed to a breakout above a long-term consolidation range. They note that XRP continues to trade above $2.47, which they see as a confirmation point for further gains. As long as this level holds, Marks considers a move to $4.8 as a likely next step. That would be a 66% increase from current prices. Their chart also outlines a possible stretch target near $7.14. This view is based on the strength of the breakout, along with high trading volume during the move. XRP has been moving sideways after a strong rally earlier in the year, but continues to hold above prior resistance areas. Caution Remains in the Background Not everyone agrees with the bullish outlook. Analyst Tom Tucker has flagged a warning. “XRP has slipped under $3 and is flashing warning signs, ” he wrote, pointing to a descending triangle pattern. If the current support breaks, a move toward $2.07 could follow, a 26% drop from where the price stands now. He also noted that 94% of the circulating XRP supply is currently in profit, a setup that sometimes leads to selling. Momentum indicators are starting to drop, and selling activity has picked up. Tucker added that bulls must defend key levels to prevent further downside. Meanwhile, the crypto market recorded over $1.44 billion in liquidations, with more than 356,000 trader accounts affected. Despite the mixed signals, XRP marked a new milestone with the launch of the REX-Osprey XRP ETF, which recorded $37.7 million in trading volume on its first day, the largest ETF debut of 2025 so far.

According to CNBC, S&P 500 futures dipped just 0.02% early in the day, with Dow Jones futures flat and Nasdaq 100 futures slipping 0.03%. This quiet open followed a wild Monday where all three major U.S. indexes, including the S&P 500, closed at new all-time highs after three straight winning sessions. The rally kicked in late Monday after Nvidia shares surged nearly 4%. The company announced it would be putting $100 billion into OpenAI to build out new data centers. That one line sent tech stocks flying, pushing the S&P 500 and its cousins to more intraday records. Chip stocks jump in Europe but ASMI slashes guidance European markets followed the tech hype early Tuesday. The Stoxx 600 went up 0.3% by mid-morning in London, and most sectors were in the green. Chip names like Be Semiconductor rose 0.8%. Infineon jumped 1.8%. STMicro added 2.1%. All of them got a boost from the Nvidia-OpenAI move. But not every tech stock climbed. ASMI and ASML both took hits. ASMI dropped 2.6% after cutting its forecast for the rest of 2025. ASML slid 1.4% in the same breath. Traders didn’t want anything to do with lowered chip equipment sales. In the bond market, U.S. Treasury yields edged lower ahead of Federal Reserve comments expected later in the day. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to speak, and markets are watching closely. The 10-year yield dropped a basis point to 4.133%. The 2-year held at 3.599%. The 30-year slipped to 4.75%. Over in Asia, tech optimism fueled strong gains. Taiwan’s Taiex index jumped 1.42%, closing at 26,247.37, a new record. Australia’s ASX/S&P 200 climbed 0.4% to 8,845.9. South Korea’s Kospi rose 0.51% to 3,486.19, though the Kosdaq lost 0.25%, ending at 872.21. Trump hits India’s tech visas as gold reaches new highs Hong Kong saw red. The Hang Seng dropped 0.99% as Super Typhoon Ragasa approached. The Hong Kong Observatory warned the storm would slam the Pearl River Estuary by Wednesday morning. In mainland China, the CSI 300 barely moved, finishing flat at 4,519.78. Japan’s markets stayed shut for a national holiday. Tech stocks in India are still shaky after a hit on Monday. President Donald Trump announced a $100,000 fee for each new H-1B visa. Those visas go to high-skilled workers, most of them from India. In 2024, about 400,000 were issued, and 71% went to Indian nationals. Gold didn’t slow down. Spot gold rose 0.2% to $3,753.25 an ounce as of 6:04 a.m. GMT, hitting $3,759.02 earlier in the session — another record. U.S. gold futures for December moved up 0.3% to $3,787.40. The weaker dollar helped. The U.S. dollar index extended losses, making gold cheaper for non-dollar buyers. In Europe , German 10-year bond yields erased earlier losses. They sat unchanged at 2.75% after fresh data showed business activity speeding up in September. Sweden’s crown stood still at 9.34 per dollar after the central bank cut interest rates to 1.75%. It said rates will stay where they are for a while. The euro was steady at $1.179, bouncing off a Monday low of $1.1726. The dollar slipped to 147.72 yen after reaching 148.37 earlier.

This decision highlights the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of strategic moves within the cryptocurrency industry. Understanding the Clanker Acquisition Offer and the Players Involved To grasp the full weight of this rejection, it is important to understand the entities at play. Clanker operates as a token launchpad platform built on the Base network, providing a crucial service for new projects looking to debut their tokens. Clanker: A Base-based token launchpad facilitating new crypto project launches. Rainbow Wallet: A well-known non-custodial wallet, offering users secure management of their digital assets. The proposed Clanker acquisition offer was an attempt by Rainbow to expand its footprint, potentially integrating launchpad functionalities or user bases. However, Clanker’s decision signals a strong commitment to its independent vision. The Details of Rainbow’s Proposal: What Was on the Table? Rainbow initially extended its acquisition proposal to Clanker on September 22. The offer was substantial, involving a significant portion of Rainbow’s native token supply. Proposal Date: September 22. Offer Details: Rainbow proposed to acquire Clanker by offering 4% of the total supply of its native RNBW token. This kind of token-based acquisition is common in the crypto space, aiming to align interests and create synergistic value between merging entities. However, despite the attractive nature of a stake in the RNBW token, Clanker’s leadership had other plans. Why the Clanker Acquisition Offer Was Rejected: A Deeper Look The core reason behind Clanker’s rejection stems from a breakdown in initial negotiations. Clanker founder Jack Dishman confirmed that talks with Rainbow did not progress as hoped, ultimately leading to the rejection of the Clanker acquisition offer . While specific details of the negotiation breakdown remain private, common reasons for such impasses in the tech and crypto sectors include: Valuation Discrepancies: Clanker may believe its platform holds a higher intrinsic value than what Rainbow’s offer represented. Strategic Alignment: Differences in long-term vision or operational strategy could have been a factor. Control and Independence: Clanker might prioritize maintaining full autonomy over its development roadmap and community. Tokenomics or Integration Challenges: Disagreements over how to integrate the RNBW token into Clanker’s existing structure or the broader tokenomics. This decision underscores Clanker’s confidence in its own trajectory and its belief in its standalone potential within the competitive Base ecosystem. Implications for Clanker, Rainbow, and the Base Ecosystem The rejection of this prominent Clanker acquisition offer carries significant implications for all parties involved and the wider Base network: For Clanker: It reinforces Clanker’s independence, allowing it to continue building and innovating on its own terms. This could boost community confidence in its self-sufficiency. For Rainbow: The wallet will need to reassess its expansion strategies. It might pursue other partnerships, develop similar features internally, or seek different acquisition targets. For the Base Ecosystem: This event highlights the robust activity and strategic maneuvering within the Base network, demonstrating that platforms are actively seeking growth opportunities and making bold independent decisions. Such rejections are not uncommon and often signal a strong, self-assured stance from the rejecting party. A Bold Statement of Independence Clanker’s decision to reject Rainbow’s acquisition proposal is a bold statement. It signals a strong belief in its own vision and value proposition as a leading token launchpad on the Base network. While the specifics of the negotiation breakdown are not public, the outcome clearly demonstrates Clanker’s commitment to its independent path. This event will undoubtedly be a topic of discussion in the crypto community, as observers watch to see how both Clanker and Rainbow adapt their strategies moving forward. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Clanker? Clanker is a token launchpad platform built on the Base blockchain network, designed to help new cryptocurrency projects launch their native tokens effectively and securely. Who is Rainbow Wallet? Rainbow Wallet is a well-known non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet that allows users to securely store, send, and receive various digital assets, giving them full control over their private keys. What was the acquisition offer from Rainbow to Clanker? Rainbow proposed to acquire Clanker by offering 4% of the total supply of its native RNBW token, with the offer being made on September 22. Why did Clanker reject the acquisition offer? Clanker’s founder, Jack Dishman, stated that initial negotiations between the two companies broke down, leading to the rejection of the offer. The exact reasons for the breakdown have not been publicly disclosed, but often relate to valuation, strategic differences, or control. What are the potential implications of this rejection for Clanker? The rejection means Clanker will continue to operate independently, allowing it to pursue its own roadmap and vision without external influence. It could also strengthen its brand as a self-sufficient and confident platform. How might this impact the Base ecosystem? This event showcases the active and competitive nature of the Base ecosystem, highlighting that platforms within it are making strategic decisions about their future, whether through growth, partnerships, or maintaining independence.

52139858,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=825853,1758619296,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52139858.jpeg,"Crypto Treasury Stocks Dump After New Investments, Bringing PEPENODE’s Presale Into the Spotlight",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-treasury-stocks-crash-as-traders-choose-crypto-presales-like-pepenode/,"Crypto treasuries lose stock value after announcing new crypto investments, while Bitcoin took a dive to $111,676. Helius Medical Technologies is among the first to fall after announcing its first $SOL investment yesterday. The company acquired 760,190 $SOL at an average $231 for over $175.6M. Following the press release, $HSDT took a tumble down the stairs, losing 33.61% by closing at $16.02. CEA Industries, backed by former Binance CEO Changpen Zhao, met a similar fate after announcing its $500M deal this past Sunday to start stacking $BNB. It too lost 19.5% , closing the day at $7.80. Not even Tom Lee’s BitMine Immersion Technologies could escape the purge, shedding 10% after disclosing that its Ethereum treasury now holds over 2% of $ETH tokens in circulation. Fortunately, the market holds strong and Strategy leads the way with a new Bitcoin buy, which could set the stage for a massive comeback. Until then, investors turn their eyes to best altcoins like PEPENODE’s ($PEPENODE) with its $1.39M presale. The Crypto Market Consolidates, Bitcoin Floats, Strategy Keeps Buying The string of bad news takes a more optimistic turn in light of Strategy’s new Bitcoin purchase. The company just bought another 850 $BTC at an average $117,344 price for a total $99.7M purchase. This increased Strategy’s Bitcoin reserves to 639,835 coins in a move that was fairly expected, given Michael Saylor’s habit of taking advantage of every dip. And this is one hell of a dip. Bitcoin took a massive fall following the last FOMC meeting, which took place on September 16-17, where the Fed decided to cut tax rates by 0.25%. $BTC’s price fell 5.23%, from $117,849 on the 18th to $111,676 yesterday. Fortunately, it recovered slightly since, as it now trades at just above $113k. Part of that is undoubtedly thanks to Strategy’s vote of confidence, despite the company losing 2.56% on NASDAQ and closing the day at $335.93. All these losses didn’t manage to shake the market’s confidence in the long-term value of crypto assets, though. In an interview with Cointelegraph on Saturday, HashKey Capital CEO, Deng Chao, declared his belief that crypto treasuries with long-term strategies will likely ‘survive any market.’ Michael Saylor’s Strategy is the perfect example of that. The company made its first $BTC purchase in August, 2020, and hasn’t stopped buying since. During this 5-year period, MSTR jumped from $14.61 to $335.93 for an ROI of 2,199.32%. So, the market is still optimistic, especially with the Fed announcing two more rate cuts this year. In this context, Bitcoin could aim for a new ATH this October as the next FOMC meeting draws close, while PEPENODEs $1.3M presale attracts more investors by the day. How Pepenode Makes Presales Fun and Engaging PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) turns presales fun, engaging, and rewarding through virtual memecoin mining. The project aims to address the most pressing problem with crypto presales : lacking ability to drive natural investor engagement. PEPENODE solves this problem by allowing you to buy mining nodes, upgrade them, and create your own virtual mining facility. The mining gameplay keeps you hooked and rewards you with higher staking bonuses as you climb the leaderboard. The earlier you tune in, the bigger the candies as well, as Pepenode offers higher rewards for early nodes based on their performance. Once the project goes live, investors will also receive actual meme coins like $FARTCOIN, $PEPE, and others. The roadmap consists of four phases and plans to turn Pepenode mainstream through partnerships with top crypto influencers and meme projects. Now’s the time because the earlier you join in, the higher the rewards, especially with the 953% dynamic staking APY – a $100 investment today could turn into $1,000+ in a year’s time (though the APY will drop as more people stake) Pepenode’s presale is at $1.39M so far, with a token price of $0.0010702. With enough community support, we expect the coin to go ballistic post launch. Our price prediction for $PEPENODE is $0.0031 in 2025 and up to $0.0095 by 2030. Mainstream adoption could ramp those numbers up drastically. So, read our guide on how to buy $PEPENODE and go to the presale page to kickstart your virtual mining rig today.

Following yesterday's sell-off, over $1.7 billion worth of leveraged positions were liquidated. Markets are starting to show signs of stability as investors try to digest one of the biggest liquidations of the year. At this point, BTC is holding above $112,000 and ETH is holding around 4100. While Bitcoin's future direction is being closely watched, Singapore-based analysis firm QCP Capital said that crypto markets are stabilizing after massive liquidations of over $1.7 billion, and October, known as a bullish month, is expected. QCP said the short-term trend is weak, but institutional demand is strong and positive. Accordingly, capital inflows into spot ETFs continue. Analysts also hinted at strong confidence in October, saying investors have begun positioning for October, historically the strongest month for BTC, and there is strong demand for call options in the $120,000 to $125,000 range. Analysts added that Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech and PCE data will be the focus for Bitcoin and altcoins this week. “Bitcoin is still up 4% in September, a seasonally weak month for cryptocurrencies. Traders are also preparing for October, BTC’s historically strongest month, and are taking positions for call options with active demand between 120,000-125,000. BTC has held within the 110,000-120,000 range this quarter, with volatility subdued as altcoins have taken center stage. Following yesterday's shakeup and as October approaches, the focus is likely to return to BTC. “Furthermore, Powell's comments and this week's Core PCE data could act as catalysts for a breakout in the fourth quarter.” Why Is October So Important? October holds a special place for Bitcoin. The market has nicknamed it “Uptober” because it typically produces strong gains. Bitcoin surged from $10,500 to $13,800 in October 2020, triggering the 2021 bull run and subsequently surpassing $60,000. In October 2023, it rebounded sharply from $27,000 to $35,000, kicking off the 2024 rally. With Bitcoin's strong performance in October, the market expects October 2025 to be the start of a new bullish wave. *This is not investment advice.

Its steady appreciation has kept its firm position as a top-tier crypto, but its larger market cap limits the potential for appreciation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , meanwhile, is still in presale at just $0.035 and has already picked up steam with its DeFi lending-and-borrowing protocol. As per analysts, MUTM’s upside at the presale phase provides room for returns far in excess of Solana’s rally, with projections as much as 5,000% if adoption goes as planned. Solana Trades Near Support Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $235.20, with support at the $230 level and resistance building around $250. Its network is still seeing strong developer activity, high throughput transactions, and increasing staking involvement, which are keeping investor interest intact. However, despite this momentum, upward movements above resistance levels have been succeeded by pullbacks, suggesting SOL may need further catalysts, such as major upgrades or institutional inflows, to sustain a rally. Compared to SOL’s current profile, investors believe that newer DeFi protocol Mutuum Finance, could have higher return potential when the next bull run starts in Q4 2025. Breaking Records at an Early Stage Stage 6 presale of MUTM is undervalued at $0.035. More than 16,500 customers have bought tokens and the project has generated more than 16.2 million. This is a clear sign that market demand is increasing and also launch hype is increasing as well. Mutuum Finance is using Chainlink oracles on ETH, MATIC and AVAX token lending, borrowing and liquidity insurance premiums. Fallback oracle parameters, composite data feeds and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages are utilized with redundant security. For that purpose, the multi-step process will ensure that price data is normalized irrespective of the size of market conditions. This is one of the ways the project maintains stability. Collateral management is directly affected by the market deviation. Liquidation values and LTV values are divided on the basis of stability in assets. Risk token ratio can be low and risk-free token ratio can be high. Its reserve’s multiplier is used proportionally 10% in low risk and 35% in the highest risk as buffer which doesn’t adversely affect the diversification. The protocol also functions in this way in risk management as well as liquidity management in its bid to function optimally in the illiquid position flipping. Risk exposures are significantly correlated with one another, as well as the liquidation level being determined. ETH and stablecoins are also used as security assets to allow for the rising of the ancillary LTV levels for collateralizing risk assets with lower-risk assets. Opportunity reserve and reserve safety risk are maximized by proportional assets class. Mutuum Finance is looking to revolutionize DeFi. It has an early adopter token contest where 10 users receive $10,000 MUTM in an ongoing $100,000 giveaway . Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction as a high-upside DeFi altcoin while Solana (SOL) holds firm at $235. Stage 6 tokens are priced at $0.035, with over 16,500 investors onboard and $16.2M raised, reflecting increasing demand. Gains of up to 5,000% are predicted by analysts as MUTM’s lending protocol, powered by Chainlink oracles, robust risk controls, and collateralized stable assets, positions it for adoptable scaling. With a $100K community giveaway to fuel engagement, MUTM offers a rare early-entry opportunity. Grab your tokens in Stage 6 before the price increases to $0.04 in the next stage.

52140161,586020,1758619812,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52140161.jpeg,GROK AI Predicts How High Dogecoin Price Will Be If Bitcoin Hits $10 Trillion Market Cap,https://bitcoinist.com/grok-ai-dogecoin-price/,"For many, the Bitcoin market cap hitting $10 trillion is seen as only a matter of time as the price rises, but what happens to meme coins like Dogecoin during this time? In the past, these altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in times of bullish rallies, and this is expected to continue with each bull cycle. Using past performances and the DOGE/BTC market cap ratio, Elon Musk’s GROK AI has projected how high the Dogecoin price would be if the Bitcoin market cap hits $10 trillion. Dogecoin Price To Eventually Cross $1 The AI takes into account the current ratio of the Dogecoin market cap relative to that of Bitcoin, and also the highest point that this ratio has been in the past. Currently, the ratio sits at around 1.76%, but in times of bullish momentum, this ratio has previously risen higher. An example of this is back in the 2021 bull market. Back when the Dogecoin euphoria was at its peak, with billionaire Elon Musk personally promoting the meme coin, the ratio of the DOGE market cap to Bitcoin rose as high as 3.5%. Using this and translating it to a time when the Bitcoin market cap reaches $10 trillion with its price above $500,000, the AI has been able to project how high the Dogecoin price would be. In times of extreme bullishness, where the Dogecoin to Bitcoin ratio rises as high as 3-4%, it would mean that the DOGE market cap could rise as high as $170 billion. This takes into account the inflationary nature of the Dogecoin supply , which the AI takes into account. Using a conservative estimate of 151 billion DOGE coins in circulation at a time when the Bitcoin market cap hits $100 trillion. Since a rise to $10 trillion market cap is a 4.39x from here for the Bitcoin price, it is expected that the Dogecoin price would see a similar increase . Or in some cases, the meme coin could outperform as it has done in the past. Using this, the AI comes up with both a conservative and a bullish target for the Dogecoin price. In the conservative target, the Dogecoin price is sitting at $1.16 with a market cap of $176 billion, while the Bitcoin market cap hits $10 trillion. However, in the more bullish scenario, where the DOGE price outperforms as it did back in 2021, the AI sees the price rising as high as $2.32, which would be a $350 billion market cap at a circulating supply of 151 billion DOGE tokens. This would mean an 8-10x in contrast to Bitcoin’s 4.39x. Factors that could drive this outperformance are highlighted, including social media hype, which has previously driven up the price. The prospect of rising adoption through ETF approvals and DOGE payments also factors into this. However, the AI also highlights the fact that regulatory crackdowns, a decline in meme coin interest, and/or Bitcoin maintaining its high dominance on the market above 60% could all lead to the meme coin’s price staying below $1.",Dogecoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news Dogecoin price|dogeusd,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|TRADING|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-23 09:30:12

Bitcoin (BTC) is still above $112,000, Ethereum (ETH) is hovering close to $4,100, and traders are now trying to figure out what the hell just happened. While crypto wrestled with panic, U.S. stocks kept rising after President Trump’s Fed cut interest rates by 0.25%, and gold prices hit new records. Just a few days ago, everyone was riding the altcoin wave. Tokens like ASTER, HYPE, and PUMP exploded as speculators piled in, convinced altcoin season was finally back. But the bottom fell out fast. There was no obvious reason, but the damage was clear. The Altcoin Season Index crashed from nearly 100 down to 65. Meanwhile, BTC dominance climbed to 57%, while ETH’s share of the market slid to 12%. Traders dumped riskier bets and ran straight back into Bitcoin. Institutions buy through the chaos, eye October breakout Despite the wreckage , institutions aren’t blinking. Firms like Strategy and Metaplanet are still buying Bitcoin. And last week’s spot ETF inflows prove that some are still looking to scoop up the dip. Even after the mess, Bitcoin is up 4% for the month in a month that’s usually trash for crypto. And with October coming up, which historically delivers Bitcoin’s best returns, traders are already placing serious bets. Call options between $120,000 and $125,000 are drawing real demand. For the past quarter, BTC has been stuck between $110,000 and $120,000. Volatility has been muted, mostly because altcoins have hogged the spotlight. But that flipped fast after the $1.7 billion flush. Now attention’s shifting back to BTC , and what happens next might depend on this week’s economic data. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will speak on Wednesday, and the Core PCE inflation numbers hit on Friday. If inflation looks under control, traders will likely expect more rate cuts from the Fed. More cuts means more liquidity, and more fuel for Bitcoin to run. The chaos is also playing out in the options market. Traders are placing their biggest bets on two opposite ends: either Bitcoin tanks below $95,000 or blasts through $140,000. That’s what’s on the table. There’s no middle ground right now. Everyone’s expecting drama, not calm. Short-term traders flood options market ahead of expiry There’s nearly $23 billion worth of BTC and ETH option contracts set to expire this Friday. That’s one of the biggest expiries ever, and it’s making people nervous. Short-term contracts are all the rage. These “out-of-the-money” bets are cheaper to buy and only pay off if prices move fast and far. The earlier rally this year was driven by crypto treasury firms, public companies that raised money just to buy Bitcoin and other tokens. But those firms have slowed down. Falling share prices have cut off their ability to raise fresh capital. That’s dragged down demand and added even more pressure to the recent slide. A big number that traders are watching is the short-term holder cost basis, which now sits at $111,400. That level is seen as the battleground between bulls and bears. If Bitcoin trades below it for long, it could mean the market’s sliding into bearish territory. Data from futures markets shows the hit to leverage. Open interest in BTC futures dropped from $44.8 billion to $42.8 billion as Bitcoin fell to $113,000. That tells you a lot of leveraged players got wrecked. But clearing out all that excess leverage can help reset things. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Now that this divergence has possibly played out, will Bitcoin start to return to the highs, or is this the beginning of a general roll over back down to the $108,000 horizontal support level? Bearish divergence finished? Source: TradingView The 4-hour time frame chart reveals how bearish divergence was probably the culprit for Bitcoin’s latest dump. While the price was continuing to climb before meeting the $117,500 horizontal resistance, the Stochastic RSI indicators made a lower high, and at the same time the RSI indicator also made lower highs. This is classic bearish divergence, and while this is only a short time frame, it was strong enough to bring the $BTC price down across the board. After hitting the $112,000 horizontal support level $BTC has been moving sideways, consolidating before a movement in one direction or the other. While it could be suggested that this consolidation might be forming a bear flag, the $BTC price did become very oversold, and all the shorter term Stochastic RSI momentum indicators were able to reset. Therefore, a move to the upside might be the more likely scenario. Daily chart shows the bulls coming back into contention Source: TradingView While there is quite a lot of information in the daily chart above, first one could look at the thick yellow line in the middle which signifies firm horizontal support. It can be seen that the $BTC price has bounced solidly from here so far. The price is back below the 50-day SMA and the 100-day SMA. Therefore, this next upward impulse will be used by the bulls to attempt to break back above these simple moving averages, with the main target being to also break through the major horizontal resistance levels at $115,700 and $117,500. It can be observed that the Stochastic RSI indicators at the bottom of the chart are heading down. This momentum marker on the daily accounts for some big moves, so once the indicators have reached bottom they will be reset and ready to signal upside price momentum once again. Beautiful market structure continues to form Source: TradingView Stripping the weekly time frame chart down to the bare bones, it can be seen that the $BTC price action is in a well-defined range. It should be noted that the bottom of the range coincides perfectly with the 0.618 Fibonacci, which only adds to the solidity of this horizontal support. As long as $BTC moves inside the bounds of this range, and the longer the price action stays within, the bigger the move to the upside that can result when the price does finally break out. Why assume that this move could break to the upside? The trend is still up, so it’s a case of respecting the trend until the very end. As things stand, there is nothing really bearish about this chart. A big move to $124,000 needed to be digested by the market and this has been taking place ever since that top. What can be seen now is beautiful market structure being built on top of the $108,000 horizontal support level. Only if a candle were to pierce through the bottom of this support, and another candle open below, would the uptrend start to be broken. As it is, the trend looks set to continue.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, understanding the broader macroeconomic landscape, particularly the health and direction of the dollar, is crucial. A strong dollar often signals risk aversion, potentially impacting crypto assets, while a weaker dollar can sometimes fuel demand for alternative investments. Bank of America (BofA) has recently released its insightful Q3 forecast, indicating a period of neutral USD flows , a development that demands closer examination. What does this ‘neutral’ stance truly mean for the world’s reserve currency, and how might it influence your investment decisions? Understanding USD Flows : BofA’s Q3 Insights When financial institutions like BofA talk about USD flows , they are referring to the net movement of US Dollars into or out of various assets and markets. These flows are a critical indicator of market sentiment and future currency direction. BofA’s latest report for the third quarter (Q3) of the year highlights a fascinating equilibrium: institutional clients, specifically hedge funds and corporates, are largely offsetting each other’s dollar movements, leading to an overall neutral outlook. This neutrality is not a sign of inactivity but rather a reflection of divergent strategies and market positions. On one side, we have the often speculative, agile movements of hedge funds. On the other, the more fundamental, operational demands of corporate entities. The confluence of these forces creates a delicate balance, suggesting that the dollar may not experience significant directional shifts based solely on these client segments in the near term. Key takeaways from BofA’s analysis on USD flows: Net Neutrality: Overall client flows suggest a balanced demand and supply for the US Dollar. Offsetting Forces: Hedge fund buying or selling is largely being counteracted by corporate hedging or investment activities. Implication: Reduced likelihood of strong, sustained dollar rallies or declines driven by these specific client segments. The Balancing Act: Decoding Hedge Fund Currency Strategies Hedge funds are known for their sophisticated and often aggressive trading strategies, aiming to generate high returns regardless of market direction. Their approach to hedge fund currency positioning is typically driven by macroeconomic outlooks, interest rate differentials, geopolitical events, and technical analysis. In the context of BofA’s report, the neutral impact of hedge fund activity is particularly noteworthy. Why might hedge funds be in a state of equilibrium regarding the dollar? Several factors could contribute: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: A lack of clear direction in global economic data (e.g., inflation, growth, central bank policy divergence) can lead hedge funds to adopt a more cautious, less directional stance. Interest Rate Parity: If the interest rate differentials between the US and other major economies are not offering a compelling arbitrage opportunity, speculative capital might remain on the sidelines or be spread across various currencies. Profit-Taking/Rebalancing: After periods of significant dollar strength or weakness, hedge funds might be taking profits or rebalancing their portfolios, leading to offsetting buy and sell orders. Cross-Asset Hedging: Some dollar positions might be part of broader cross-asset hedges, where currency exposure is managed in conjunction with equity, bond, or commodity positions. This current neutrality from hedge funds suggests a market grappling with mixed signals, where conviction for a strong dollar rally or a significant sell-off is not universally shared among these influential players. Corporate Currency Strategy : Hedging Against Volatility In contrast to the speculative nature of hedge funds, corporate currency strategy is primarily driven by operational necessities, risk management, and long-term investment goals. Corporations engage in foreign exchange markets for a variety of reasons: Hedging Operational Exposure: Companies with international operations need to protect against adverse currency movements impacting their revenues, costs, and profit margins. This involves hedging future receivables or payables. Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A): Cross-border M&A deals often involve significant currency conversions and associated hedging strategies. Repatriation of Earnings: Multinational corporations may convert foreign earnings back into their home currency, influencing dollar flows. Capital Expenditure: Investing in foreign markets requires converting domestic currency into the local currency. BofA’s report indicates that corporate flows are largely counteracting hedge fund flows. This could be due to several factors. For instance, if hedge funds were net sellers of the dollar, corporations might be net buyers for hedging purposes, perhaps anticipating future dollar weakness or simply managing existing exposures. Conversely, if hedge funds were buying dollars speculatively, corporations might be selling to lock in favorable rates for repatriating earnings or funding foreign investments. This intricate dance between corporate prudence and speculative positioning is what ultimately leads to the observed neutral USD flows . Navigating the US Dollar Outlook for Q3: What to Expect? A neutral forecast for US Dollar outlook in Q3, while seemingly uneventful, is actually quite telling. It implies that while there are forces pushing and pulling the dollar in different directions, none are strong enough to establish a dominant trend from the perspective of these key institutional flows. This doesn’t mean the dollar will be completely static, but rather that its movements might be more range-bound or driven by other, less predictable factors. Several external factors will continue to shape the dollar’s trajectory: Federal Reserve Policy: Future interest rate decisions by the Fed will remain a primary driver. Any shifts in rhetoric regarding rate hikes or cuts could quickly alter sentiment. Global Economic Growth: The relative economic performance of the US versus other major economies (Europe, China, Japan) will influence capital flows. Stronger US growth tends to support the dollar. Geopolitical Developments: Unforeseen global events, conflicts, or political instability can trigger safe-haven demand for the dollar, regardless of underlying flows. Inflation Trends: Persistent inflation or disinflationary pressures will guide central bank actions, which in turn impact currency valuations. For investors, this neutral outlook suggests a period where fundamental analysis and careful monitoring of macro data will be paramount. Expect the dollar to react more acutely to incoming economic reports and central bank communications. Broader Q3 Currency Trends and Market Implications Beyond the US Dollar, BofA’s report on institutional flows provides a lens through which to view broader Q3 currency trends . If the dollar is largely neutral, what does this imply for other major currencies like the Euro, Japanese Yen, or British Pound? A neutral dollar often means that other currencies might find their own drivers, or they might also exhibit range-bound behavior against the dollar if global macro uncertainty is pervasive. For instance: Euro (EUR): The Euro’s performance will likely hinge on the European Central Bank’s (ECB) policy decisions and the economic health of the Eurozone. Japanese Yen (JPY): The JPY remains highly sensitive to global risk sentiment and the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) ultra-loose monetary policy. Emerging Market Currencies: These currencies are often more volatile and can be significantly impacted by dollar strength or weakness, as well as commodity prices and local economic conditions. A neutral dollar might offer some respite, but local factors will dominate. For crypto investors, a neutral dollar might imply less pressure from a strong dollar “risk-off” environment, potentially allowing crypto assets to trade more on their own fundamentals or specific market narratives. However, it also means that clear macro tailwinds for crypto from a weakening dollar might be absent, requiring a more nuanced approach to portfolio management. Actionable Insights for Investors and Traders Given BofA’s neutral forecast for USD flows in Q3, what steps can investors and traders take? Diversify Portfolios: Do not rely solely on a strong or weak dollar narrative. Diversify across various asset classes and geographies to mitigate currency-specific risks. Monitor Macro Data Closely: Pay close attention to inflation reports, GDP figures, employment data, and central bank speeches from major economies. These will be the primary drivers of short-term currency movements. Consider Hedging Strategies: If you have significant international exposure, evaluate whether currency hedging is appropriate for your portfolio to protect against unexpected volatility. Focus on Relative Value: In a neutral dollar environment, look for opportunities in currencies that might be undervalued or overvalued relative to their economic fundamentals. Crypto & Dollar Correlation: While not always direct, remember that dollar strength can sometimes weigh on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. A neutral dollar might reduce this pressure, but individual crypto asset performance will still depend on project-specific developments and broader market sentiment. Conclusion: A Balanced Outlook Amidst Shifting Sands Bank of America’s assessment of neutral USD flows for Q3 paints a picture of a finely balanced market, where the robust and often conflicting strategies of hedge funds and corporate entities cancel each other out. This equilibrium suggests that the immediate future of the US Dollar outlook may be characterized by range-bound trading rather than aggressive directional moves driven by these institutional players. While this neutrality might seem uneventful, it underscores the complex interplay of forces shaping global finance. As we navigate the evolving Q3 currency trends , vigilance, diversification, and a keen eye on macroeconomic indicators will be paramount for both traditional and crypto investors. The market is always in motion, even when appearing still, and understanding these underlying currents is key to informed decision-making.

In an attached video, he expanded on the question by reviewing XRP’s recent price performance, its current consolidation phase, and the broader market outlook heading into the final quarter of the year. He stated clearly that his perspective was not financial advice but rather his personal opinion on market conditions. Hilton began by examining XRP’s historical price movements. He pointed to July, when XRP increased from $2.02 to more than $3.54 within 30 days, representing a 65 percent gain. He highlighted this as an example of how quickly XRP can appreciate following periods of sideways trading. According to him, XRP is currently in such a consolidation phase, trading within a range of about $2.80 to $3.39 for 65 consecutive days. He described this as a sign of stability before potential movement, noting that this type of behavior historically repeats. Is it the perfect time to buy XRP? pic.twitter.com/qilENIe5At — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) September 21, 2025 Consolidation and Timing for Entry Hilton explained that XRP’s current trading range reflects a lack of broader market activity through August and September. He noted that sideways movement often precedes stronger upward shifts and expressed the view that October could mark the beginning of the next breakout. At the time of recording, he observed XRP trading near $2.96, which he considered an attractive entry point. He emphasized that whether someone is a new buyer or already holds XRP, the present market conditions suggest there is no disadvantage to accumulating more. Hilton stated that he personally continues to buy XRP and sees its ongoing consolidation as preparation for a larger upward trend . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Outlook for the Remainder of 2025 Looking ahead, Hilton projected that October, November, and December would be pivotal months for the broader cryptocurrency market. He mentioned the possibility of Bitcoin reaching between $150,000 and $200,000 and Ethereum more than doubling in value. In line with this, he suggested XRP could reach $9 to $10 on the lower end, assuming liquidity and favorable market conditions are present. Hilton also cautioned that external global macroeconomic or geopolitical events could influence this trajectory, but under stable circumstances, he expects XRP to follow the broader bullish cycle. He noted that the final days of September would likely remain within the current consolidation range, with the early weeks of October possibly starting slowly. He believes significant upward momentum may begin by mid-October and extend through November and December. Hilton concluded that for long-term investors, the current period represents a favorable time to buy or add to existing XRP holdings . He recommended a gradual approach, suggesting that buyers could consider dollar-cost averaging into the market, purchasing some now and more as October unfolds. His final view was that XRP is well-positioned for a potential breakout, making the present moment a reasonable entry point for those with a long-term holding strategy.

52140452,587133,1758620340,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52140452.jpeg,US Lawmakers Urge SEC to Implement Crypto 401(K) Plan – Time for Best Wallet to Shine?,https://bitcoinist.com/us-lawmakers-sec-letter-401k-best-wallet/,"Nine US lawmakers addressed a letter to US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins yesterday, urging him to assist in implementing President Donald Trump’s Executive Order (EO) that gives Americans access to retirement funds that invest in crypto. Once implemented, the EO is expected to boost crypto adoption among everyday Americans. In turn, this should increase the need for a secure and user-friendly crypto wallet, like the one powered by Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . Lawmakers’ Letter Could Accelerate Crypto Adoption Among Everyday Americans In the letter, lawmakers led by Committee on Financial Services Chairman French Hill urged Atkins to provide ‘swift assistance’ to the Secretary of Labor and make necessary revisions to Trump’s EO 14330. Formally known as ‘Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(K) Investors’, the EO signed in August allows citizens to have access to retirement funds that include ‘investments in alternative assets.’ These alternative assets include companies with ‘holdings in actively managed investment vehicles that are investing in digital assets.’ In other words, workers will be able to choose funds that invest in cryptocurrencies. The move is seen to further increase the number of Americans exposed to cryptocurrencies in one way or another. A primary driver here will be the growing number of crypto ETFs being approved by the SEC , which give investors indirect exposure to digital assets. The number of Americans who choose to own crypto directly is growing too. According to Security.org, 28% of American adults directly own crypto in 2025 compared to just 15% in 2021. This then leads to an increased need for a place to securely put their assets. Best Wallet Token: Powering the Future of Crypto Wallets Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is a project that powers one of the most exciting crypto wallets in recent history. Through its token presale, it aims to accelerate the development of the wallet that shares its name and offer exclusive perks to token holders. To find out more about the project, be sure to check out our What is Best Wallet Token page. It contains everything you need to know about the token, including its tokenomics, community sentiment, and whether it is legit or not. As an app that works on both iOS and Android devices, the Best Wallet app makes it easy for anyone to use crypto wallets. Simply download it for free from the appropriate app store, set it up with a few taps, and you’re good to go. Best Wallet is a no-KYC crypto wallet . This means that you don’t need to submit any government ID or documentation to use it. Aside from that, not uploading anything with your personal information helps secure your identity too. It’s also a non-custodial crypto wallet . As such, you have sole control over your private keys, which are used to sign your transactions and prove your ownership of your digital assets. This helps ensure that those keys remain secure against hackers and scammers. $BEST’s Presale Proves A Hit With Investors To get the most out of the app, consider buying its native $BEST token. With this, you’ll be able to enjoy added benefits, such as low transaction fees, early access to the best crypto presales in the Token Launchpad, and governance rights. In fact, it’s those exclusive benefits and solid utility that have seen the $BEST presale raise $16M+ so far, and it shows no signs of slowing anytime soon. Whales are also being drawn to the presale, among them a $70.2K buy earlier this month. Currently, $BEST costs just $0.025685, making it an affordable way to invest in the project and enjoy exclusive perks. You can also stake your tokens immediately and earn rewards at 83% p.a. With $BEST potentially hitting $0.82 by 2030 – according to our Best Wallet Token price prediction – HODLing is another option if you’re a long-term investor. Whichever option you choose, our guide on how to buy Best Wallet Token will walk you through the process of getting your hands on the token. Take note, though, that the presale will regularly increase the token’s price. With less than two days until the next price increase, now’s your last chance to get $BEST at its current price.

The exchange has revised the PLUME circulation plan following a direct request from the project’s team. This move underscores the dynamic nature of digital asset management and the ongoing collaboration between exchanges and token projects to ensure healthy ecosystem growth. What Does a PLUME Circulation Plan Entail? Understanding a token’s circulation plan is essential for any investor. It essentially outlines how many tokens are in existence, how they are distributed, and at what rate new tokens will enter the market. This includes details on token unlocks, vesting schedules, and overall supply management. For PLUME, the circulation plan dictates its availability and potential scarcity. Any adjustment to this plan can have notable implications for its market dynamics and investor sentiment. Therefore, Upbit’s announcement is a key piece of information for current and prospective PLUME holders. Why Did Upbit Revise the PLUME Circulation Plan? The decision to revise the PLUME circulation plan came directly from the PLUME project team. Such requests are not uncommon in the fast-evolving crypto space. Projects often adapt their tokenomics based on market conditions, development milestones, or community feedback. Upbit, as a leading exchange, plays a crucial role in facilitating these updates transparently. Their willingness to work with project teams on such fundamental aspects highlights a commitment to supporting the ecosystem while ensuring clear communication to their user base. What are the Key Changes in the Revised PLUME Circulation Plan? While the specific details of the revisions were communicated by Upbit, they typically involve adjustments to: Release Schedule: Changes in the timing or quantity of tokens entering circulation. Allocation: Revisions to how tokens are distributed among various stakeholders, such as team, investors, or community. Vesting Periods: Modifications to the lock-up periods for early contributors or the project team. These adjustments are often designed to stabilize the token’s value, incentivize long-term holding, or provide necessary liquidity for project development. Investors should carefully review the updated plan to understand its direct impact on their holdings. How Does This Affect PLUME Holders and the Market? A revised PLUME circulation plan can have several effects. On one hand, a reduction in the immediate circulating supply might create scarcity, potentially leading to price appreciation. Conversely, an increase could introduce more supply, possibly affecting market value. Moreover, transparency from Upbit regarding these changes helps maintain trust. It allows investors to make informed decisions based on the most current information available about PLUME’s tokenomics. Staying informed is always the best strategy in crypto investments. Upbit’s Role in Ensuring Market Transparency Upbit’s proactive communication about the revised PLUME circulation plan is vital. Exchanges act as gatekeepers and facilitators in the crypto market. Their role extends beyond merely listing tokens; it includes providing crucial updates that affect market integrity and investor confidence. This commitment to transparency fosters a healthier trading environment. It reassures users that significant changes to listed assets are disclosed promptly and clearly, upholding the principles of a fair and open market. The revision of the PLUME circulation plan by Upbit, at the request of the project team, is a clear example of the adaptive nature of the cryptocurrency world. It emphasizes the continuous efforts to optimize token ecosystems and respond to evolving needs. For PLUME holders, staying updated on these changes is paramount to navigating the market effectively. This development highlights the importance of dynamic management in the journey of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a token circulation plan? A token circulation plan outlines the total supply of a cryptocurrency, how tokens are distributed, and the schedule for when new tokens enter the market. It includes details like vesting periods and unlock schedules. Q2: Why was the PLUME circulation plan revised? The PLUME circulation plan was revised at the direct request of the PLUME project team. This often occurs to optimize tokenomics based on project development, market conditions, or strategic adjustments. Q3: How can I find the specific details of the revised PLUME circulation plan? Upbit typically publishes detailed announcements on its official website or through its communication channels. PLUME holders should check Upbit’s announcements section for the complete revised plan details. Q4: Will this revision impact the price of PLUME? Changes to a token’s circulation plan can influence its price. For example, reducing the immediate circulating supply might create scarcity, while increasing it could add market pressure. The actual impact depends on the specifics of the revision and broader market sentiment. Q5: What is Upbit’s role in these revisions? Upbit facilitates the implementation and communication of such revisions. As a crypto exchange, it ensures transparency by announcing changes to the circulation plans of tokens listed on its platform, helping to keep investors informed.

52140854,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/4-ethereum-tokens-ready-to-explode-as-3-new-wallets-buy-1488m-eth,1758620611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/52140854.jpeg,4 Ethereum Tokens Ready to Explode as 3 New Wallets Buy $148.8M ETH,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/4-ethereum-tokens-ready-to-explode-as-3-new-wallets-buy-1488m-eth,"Ethereum’s network is buzzing with renewed optimism. In recent days, blockchain trackers flagged three fresh wallets scooping up a combined $148.8 million worth of ETH, sparking speculation across the market. Big wallet inflows of this kind rarely occur without deeper conviction. They often precede a sharp run in Ethereum itself while simultaneously igniting upside in Ethereum-based tokens tethered to its momentum. Here are four tokens set to surge thanks to the renewed capital inflow, with Little Pepe leading the pack. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Among Ethereum ecosystem tokens right now, Little Pepe is drawing the loudest bullish whispers. The project is more than another meme coin; it is laying down Ethereum Layer-2 infrastructure tailored for meme projects. This ambitious plan has resonated with investors, evident in its blockbuster presale performance. Currently in Stage 12 at $0.0021, the presale is already 98.8% complete. Over $25 million has been raised across stages, and a staggering 15.5 billion tokens have been sold. Those numbers place LILPEPE in a league of its own among presale phenomena. Every stage that sells out creates urgency, tightening supply while pushing investors toward higher price entries. Little Pepe’s marriage of meme appeal and infrastructure positioning makes LILPEPE a breakout candidate to deliver 25x to 50x returns once it hits open markets. In a market where whales are stockpiling Ethereum itself, a meme-centric Layer-2 solution on Ethereum looks like rocket fuel waiting for ignition. Optimism (OP) If Ethereum whales are betting on long-term scalability, it’s impossible to ignore Optimism. As one of Ethereum’s flagship Layer-2 networks, Optimism drastically reduces transaction fees and accelerates throughput without sacrificing Ethereum’s security backbone. Its Optimistic Rollup model has attracted developers, DeFi apps, and institutional-level adoption. Currently trading at a discount relative to its long-term value projections, OP offers asymmetric upside. If ETH pushes toward new all-time highs on the back of whale buying, Optimism could outperform, making it one of the clearest bets among Ethereum’s ecosystem tokens. Arbitrum (ARB) Where Optimism goes, Arbitrum is never far behind. The two networks dominate Ethereum’s Layer-2 ecosystem, and together they’ve captured billions in total value locked (TVL). Arbitrum’s governance token, ARB, has experienced volatility since launch, but this is precisely where opportunity lies. The token is undervalued compared to its ecosystem dominance. As Ethereum whale buying hints at upcoming bullish momentum, capital tends to rotate into scaling solutions first. ARB’s current levels leave ample room for explosive upside when sentiment shifts decisively bullish. Uniswap (UNI) Uniswap popularized AMM, which in turn transformed DeFi. It continues to capture the most trading volume across decentralized platforms. With the resurgence of Ethereum whale activity, DeFi platforms like Uniswap will inevitably benefit. As trading volumes surge across presales, meme coins, and blue-chip assets, UNI accrues value indirectly through fee generation and governance power. More importantly, Uniswap’s multi-chain expansion has made it a permanent fixture in DeFi. For investors looking for a mix of brand recognition and DeFi exposure tied to Ethereum’s growth, UNI is a straightforward pick. Why Whale Buying Matters Now Crypto markets thrive on signals, and nothing signals conviction like whale wallets accumulating nearly $150 million worth of Ethereum. It suggests confidence not only in ETH itself but in the ecosystem tokens set to thrive on its rails. When whales buy, liquidity follows, narratives strengthen, and retail FOMO often triggers the kind of exponential rallies that define crypto cycles. The four tokens outlined here represent different prongs of Ethereum’s growing influence. LILPEPE captures meme energy while layering in genuine utility. OP and ARB are the backbone of Ethereum’s scaling future. UNI continues to dominate DeFi infrastructure. Together, they form a powerful basket of Ethereum ecosystem exposure that looks ready to surge in the wake of whale accumulation. The Bottom Line Ethereum’s whales have spoken with their wallets. $148.8 million in accumulation is not just a headline—it’s a directional bet on the ecosystem’s explosive growth. For investors eyeing asymmetric upside, Little Pepe, Optimism, Arbitrum, and Uniswap stand as the strongest Ethereum-linked tokens to accumulate now. Among these, LILPEPE offers the rawest upside potential as its presale nears conclusion and exchange listings loom. With momentum building and whales accumulating ETH, the stage is set for a dramatic rally.

As we delve deeper into this phenomenon, we identify four Ethereum tokens that are poised for substantial growth, driven by this fresh wave of optimism and investment. The Impact of Major Wallet Purchases on Ethereum and its Tokens The recent purchase of $148.8 million in Ethereum by three newly established wallets is more than just a routine transaction—it signals a powerful endorsement of Ethereum's long-term value. Such moves are usually strategic, made by investors with in-depth market knowledge and a bullish outlook on the underlying assets. Spotlight on Potential High-Performers in Ethereum's Ecosystem Among the tokens linked to Ethereum's infrastructure, certain projects stand out due to their innovative approaches and alignment with current market trends. Here's a closer look at four such tokens: 1. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Little Pepe is not just another entrant in the meme coin sector. It is strategically creating Layer-2 solutions specifically for meme-oriented projects on the Ethereum blockchain. This unique positioning has already garnered significant attention, as evidenced by LILPEPE's impressive presale figures, which are nearing completion with substantial funds raised. A glance at Little Pepe's current standing reveals a presale in its 12th stage, priced at $0.0021 per token, with a remarkable 98.8% of its tokens already sold. The success of each presale stage adds to the scarcity of LILPEPE, potentially leading to heightened demand and increased prices as it approaches public trading phases. 2. Optimism (OP) Optimism represents a core component of Ethereum's scalability solutions. Its Optimistic Rollup technology is designed to enhance transaction speeds and reduce costs, all while maintaining Ethereum's robust security features. Given the current dynamics, Optimism's token (OP) is undervalued, presenting a lucrative opportunity for growth, especially if Ethereum's price escalates. 3. Arbitrum (ARB) Arbitrum operates alongside Optimism as a dominant force in Ethereum's Layer-2 scaling solutions.

For those accustomed to the rapid shifts in cryptocurrency prices, the traditional Forex market might seem calmer, yet it holds profound implications for global economics and investment strategies. Today, we delve into a significant projection from Bank of America (BofA) that could reshape perceptions and strategies surrounding the ‘Antipodean cross’ – the AUD/NZD currency pair. BofA’s latest AUD/NZD forecast suggests a notable shift, predicting the pair will reach 1.20 by mid-2026. This outlook signals a period of relative strength for the Australian Dollar against its Tasman neighbour, driven by a confluence of economic factors and, crucially, fading upside risks for the New Zealand Dollar. Unpacking the AUD/NZD Forecast: What Drives BofA’s Bold Prediction? Bank of America, a major player in global finance, has issued a compelling AUD/NZD forecast , projecting a move towards 1.20 over the next two and a half years. This target implies a significant appreciation of the Australian Dollar relative to the New Zealand Dollar. To put this into perspective, if the pair is currently trading around 1.08-1.10, a move to 1.20 represents a substantial shift in favor of the AUD. But what underpins such a confident prediction from a reputable institution like BofA? The core of BofA’s analysis appears to rest on a widening divergence in the economic and monetary policy trajectories of Australia and New Zealand. While both economies are closely linked and often move in tandem, subtle yet powerful differences are emerging. These differences are expected to create a more favorable environment for the Australian Dollar, while simultaneously diminishing the catalysts for a stronger New Zealand Dollar . Key considerations likely influencing BofA’s view include: Monetary Policy Divergence: The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) may adopt different approaches to interest rates, influencing currency attractiveness. Economic Growth Differentials: Variations in GDP growth, employment, and inflation rates between the two nations. Commodity Price Dynamics: Australia’s strong reliance on iron ore and other industrial commodities versus New Zealand’s agricultural exports. Global Risk Sentiment: How investors perceive the relative safety and growth prospects of each economy in a changing global landscape. Understanding these underlying currents is essential for anyone looking to navigate the complexities of the Forex market, whether you’re a seasoned trader or an investor keen on diversifying your portfolio beyond digital assets. Why is the New Zealand Dollar Losing its Shine? Analyzing Fading Upside Risks A central tenet of BofA’s prediction is the observation that upside risks for the New Zealand Dollar are gradually fading. This doesn’t necessarily mean a collapse of the NZD, but rather a reduction in the factors that would typically push it higher. Several elements contribute to this assessment: RBNZ’s Stance: The Reserve Bank of New Zealand was one of the first central banks among developed economies to aggressively hike interest rates. However, with inflation showing signs of cooling and the economy facing headwinds, the RBNZ may be approaching the end of its tightening cycle, or even contemplating rate cuts sooner than other major central banks. This shift can reduce the appeal of the NZD for carry trades. Economic Slowdown: New Zealand’s economy has shown signs of slowing, with sectors like housing experiencing a downturn. Weaker economic data, including retail sales and business confidence, can weigh on the currency. Commodity Price Sensitivity: While New Zealand benefits from strong dairy prices, a broader global slowdown or shifts in agricultural demand could impact its key exports. Unlike Australia’s diversified commodity basket, New Zealand’s economy is more concentrated in certain agricultural sectors. Global Risk Aversion: The NZD is often considered a higher-beta currency, meaning it tends to perform well during periods of global optimism and poorly during times of risk aversion. If global growth prospects dim, or geopolitical tensions rise, the NZD could face downward pressure as investors seek safer havens. Consider the recent trajectory of inflation and interest rates in New Zealand. After reaching multi-decade highs, inflation is beginning to moderate. This allows the RBNZ more flexibility, potentially leading to a less hawkish stance than markets previously priced in. Such a shift directly impacts the attractiveness of the New Zealand Dollar on the global stage, contributing to the fading upside potential BofA highlights. The Australian Dollar Outlook: Riding the Wave of Relative Strength In contrast to the fading prospects for the NZD, the Australian Dollar outlook appears more robust, according to BofA. Australia’s economy, while not immune to global challenges, possesses several structural advantages and current tailwinds that could support its currency against the NZD. What gives the AUD its relative strength? RBA’s Policy Path: The Reserve Bank of Australia has often been perceived as more cautious in its monetary policy adjustments compared to the RBNZ. However, persistent inflation and a resilient labor market in Australia might necessitate a more sustained period of higher interest rates, or at least a slower path to rate cuts, than in New Zealand. This divergence in expected policy paths can significantly benefit the AUD. Commodity Powerhouse: Australia is a major exporter of iron ore, coal, and other critical minerals. Global demand for these commodities, particularly from China, remains a key driver for the AUD. Any sustained recovery or stability in China’s economy directly translates into stronger demand for Australian exports, bolstering the currency. Strong Migration and Population Growth: Australia has seen robust population growth driven by migration, which contributes to economic activity, labor supply, and overall demand. This demographic dividend can provide a structural boost to the economy. Resilient Labor Market: Australia’s unemployment rate has remained low, indicating a tight labor market. This strength supports consumer spending and overall economic stability, providing a solid foundation for the AUD. The interplay of these factors suggests that while both economies face global headwinds, Australia’s specific economic structure and policy outlook might offer a more compelling narrative for currency appreciation. The Australian Dollar outlook is thus seen as more positive in a relative sense, driving the AUD/NZD pair higher. Navigating the Forex Market Analysis: Implications for Traders and Investors For traders and investors, BofA’s Forex market analysis presents a clear directional bias for the AUD/NZD pair. A forecast of 1.20 by mid-2026 is not merely an academic exercise; it carries tangible implications for strategic positioning. What does this mean for your trading strategy? Long AUD/NZD Positions: Traders who agree with BofA’s outlook might consider initiating or maintaining long positions on the AUD/NZD pair, aiming to profit from the expected appreciation of the Australian Dollar. This involves buying AUD and selling NZD simultaneously. Interest Rate Differentials (Carry Trade): If the interest rate differential between Australia and New Zealand is expected to widen in favor of Australia, a positive carry trade could emerge. This means earning interest on the higher-yielding AUD while paying interest on the lower-yielding NZD, potentially adding to returns. Hedging Strategies: Businesses with exposure to either the AUD or NZD might use this forecast to inform their hedging strategies. For example, a New Zealand exporter receiving AUD might consider locking in future exchange rates to capitalize on the expected strength of the AUD. Portfolio Diversification: Investors looking to diversify their portfolios beyond traditional assets or even cryptocurrencies might find the Forex market, and specifically this pair, an interesting avenue. Understanding macro trends can inform broader investment decisions. However, it is crucial to remember that forecasts are not guarantees. The Forex market analysis must always be accompanied by robust risk management. Unexpected economic data, sudden policy shifts, or unforeseen global events can quickly alter market dynamics. Therefore, stop-loss orders, position sizing, and continuous monitoring of economic indicators are paramount. Understanding Currency Exchange Rates: Beyond the Headlines The movement of currency exchange rates like AUD/NZD is a complex dance influenced by a myriad of factors, often extending far beyond the immediate headlines. While BofA’s forecast provides a clear direction, understanding the underlying mechanisms is key to informed decision-making. At its core, a currency exchange rate reflects the relative demand and supply for one currency against another. This demand and supply are driven by: Interest Rate Differentials: Higher interest rates generally attract foreign capital, increasing demand for a currency. Economic Performance: Strong economic growth, low unemployment, and stable inflation make a country’s currency more attractive. Trade Balances: A country that exports more than it imports (a trade surplus) generally sees its currency appreciate as foreign buyers demand its currency. Political Stability and Geopolitical Events: Stable political environments and a lack of major geopolitical risks tend to support a currency. Market Sentiment and Speculation: Trader expectations and large speculative positions can also significantly influence short-term movements. For the AUD/NZD pair, the relative performance of these indicators in Australia versus New Zealand dictates the direction of the currency exchange rates . For instance, if Australia’s economic growth outperforms New Zealand’s, and the RBA maintains a tighter monetary policy than the RBNZ, the AUD is likely to strengthen against the NZD. BofA’s forecast suggests a belief that such a divergence will indeed play out over the coming years. Monetary Policy Divergence: A Deep Dive into RBA vs. RBNZ The divergent paths of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) are arguably the most significant drivers behind BofA’s AUD/NZD forecast . Historically, both central banks have often moved in sync, given the close economic ties. However, recent developments suggest a potential decoupling. The RBNZ was an early and aggressive hiker of interest rates, moving quickly to combat inflation. This front-loading of rate hikes means they may now be in a position to pause or even consider cuts earlier than other central banks, as their economy feels the full effect of tighter policy. In contrast, the RBA has adopted a more gradual approach, often being described as patient. If Australian inflation proves more sticky, or the economy more resilient, the RBA might need to maintain higher rates for longer, or even implement further hikes, while the RBNZ eases its stance. This widening interest rate differential would make the AUD more attractive to yield-seeking investors, providing a strong tailwind for the currency pair. Commodity Price Influence: Iron Ore vs. Dairy Both Australia and New Zealand are commodity-dependent economies, but their primary exports differ significantly, leading to varied impacts from global commodity price fluctuations. Australia’s economy is heavily influenced by industrial commodities, particularly iron ore, coal, and natural gas. Strong global demand, especially from China’s industrial sector, directly benefits the Australian Dollar outlook . New Zealand, on the other hand, is a major exporter of agricultural products, with dairy being a dominant component. While dairy prices have been robust, global demand for agricultural goods can be subject to different cycles and external factors compared to industrial metals. A slowdown in global growth might impact industrial commodity demand less severely than agricultural, or vice-versa, creating another point of divergence for their respective currencies. China’s Economic Impact: A Key Factor for Both China is a crucial trading partner for both Australia and New Zealand. However, Australia’s economic ties to China, particularly in terms of raw material exports, are arguably more direct and impactful on the AUD. Any signs of recovery or sustained growth in China’s economy tend to provide a significant boost to the Australian Dollar outlook . While New Zealand also trades with China, the nature of its exports means it might be less sensitive to certain shifts in China’s industrial output or infrastructure spending. Global Economic Backdrop and Risk Sentiment The broader global economic environment and investor risk sentiment play a critical role in currency exchange rates . In periods of global uncertainty or risk aversion, investors tend to flock to perceived safe-haven currencies, or at least those with strong fundamentals. While neither the AUD nor the NZD are traditional safe havens, their performance is often linked to global growth prospects. The NZD, being a higher-beta currency, can be more sensitive to shifts in global risk sentiment. If the global outlook remains cautious, this could disproportionately affect the NZD compared to the AUD, which might benefit from its commodity exports even in a slower growth environment. Actionable Insights for Your Portfolio Given BofA’s AUD/NZD forecast , what steps can you consider? Monitor Economic Data: Pay close attention to inflation reports, GDP figures, employment data, and central bank statements from both Australia and New Zealand. These will provide real-time indicators of whether the forecast trajectory remains valid. Consider Long-Term Positions: For investors with a longer time horizon, a strategic long AUD/NZD position could align with BofA’s mid-2026 target. Diversify: Even if you are primarily invested in cryptocurrencies, understanding traditional markets like Forex can offer insights into broader economic trends that eventually influence all asset classes. Risk Management: Always employ robust risk management strategies, including setting clear stop-loss levels and managing position sizes appropriate for your risk tolerance. Challenges and Risks to the Forecast No forecast is without its risks. Several factors could challenge BofA’s prediction: Unexpected Policy Shifts: A sudden, aggressive shift in RBNZ or RBA policy could alter the landscape. Global Economic Shocks: A severe global recession or an unforeseen geopolitical event could impact both economies and currencies in unpredictable ways. Commodity Price Volatility: Sharp, sustained drops in commodity prices, particularly iron ore, could undermine the Australian Dollar outlook . Forecast Horizon: A forecast stretching to mid-2026 is a long one, leaving ample room for unforeseen developments. A Compelling Conclusion on the Antipodean Cross Bank of America’s projection for the AUD/NZD pair to reach 1.20 by mid-2026 offers a compelling narrative for the coming years. It underscores a belief in a growing divergence between the economic fortunes and monetary policy paths of Australia and New Zealand. The fading upside risks for the New Zealand Dollar , coupled with a more resilient Australian Dollar outlook , form the bedrock of this significant Forex market analysis . While the path to 1.20 may not be linear, the fundamental drivers outlined by BofA provide a robust framework for understanding potential movements in these crucial currency exchange rates . For traders and investors alike, staying informed about these macro trends is not just about profiting from a forecast, but about understanding the intricate dance of global economics that shapes our financial world.

The Best Crypto to Diversify Amid Turbulence,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-is-dropping-best-crypto-to-diversify/,"The crypto market has taken a nosedive this week, as evidenced by major assets like $BTC, $ETH, and $SOL dropping into the red zone. Still, this doesn’t mean you have to halt your strategy; downturns can be prime moments to reassess, stack wisely, and position for the rebound using some of the best crypto to buy . Crypto Market Cap Drops 5.5% in Just Five Days Over the past five days alone, the total crypto market cap has dropped by roughly 5.5% , from $4.13T to $3.9T. During the same time frame, $BTC has plummeted from a $117K high to a $111K low. It’s now at $113K, a far cry (9%) from its $124K ATH. And when the crypto leader drops, others typically follow. Since last week, $ETH and $SOL have also taken a tumble by around 7%. Not helping matters is the CoinMarketCap Fear and Greed Index currently in the neutral zone at 40 . It has slipped from 50 last week and 47 yesterday, which suggests that traders are becoming all the more cautious. But what’s adding even more pressure to the market right now? Major Crypto Assets Fall Amid $1.7B Liquidations Just yesterday, the crypto market experienced a significant shift following widespread liquidations worth $1.7B . Regulatory headlines have added another layer of uncertainty. Just yesterday, Reuters reported that China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) instructed specific Hong Kong brokerages to halt their real-world asset (RWA) businesses. The CSRC tightening its grip on tokenized assets poses a significant setback for the Web3 sector. The reason is that tokenized assets have been gaining considerable traction in DeFi with a $2.47B market cap . For crypto traders, it serves as a stark reminder of how regulatory pushback can directly impact sentiment, liquidity, and the integration of new blockchain use cases into mainstream markets. But there’s no need to stop trading altogether. Market dips like these often create entry points, making now a prime time to acquire high-quality crypto before the next boom. 1.

For many investors, particularly those in the cryptocurrency space who observe stablecoins pegged to major fiat currencies, understanding these dynamics is paramount. Today, we turn our attention to a significant forecast from Barclays regarding the USD/HKD pair, predicting consolidation near 7.79 amidst the unwinding of carry trades. This isn’t just a technical detail; it’s a window into the intricate dance of global interest rates, liquidity, and the resilience of the Hong Kong Dollar . Understanding the USD/HKD Peg: A Pillar of Stability? The USD/HKD exchange rate is unique due to Hong Kong’s Linked Exchange Rate System. Since 1983, the Hong Kong Dollar has been pegged to the US Dollar, operating within a narrow band of 7.75 to 7.85 HKD per USD. This system is designed to provide monetary stability for Hong Kong, a global financial hub. How does the peg work? Intervention by the HKMA: The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) actively intervenes in the market to maintain the peg. If the HKD weakens to 7.85, the HKMA buys HKD from the market, reducing its supply and strengthening its value. If it strengthens to 7.75, the HKMA sells HKD, increasing supply and weakening its value. Interest Rate Arbitrage: The system relies on interest rate differentials. When the HKD is at the strong end of the peg (7.75), interest rates in Hong Kong tend to be lower than in the US, encouraging capital outflows. Conversely, at the weak end (7.85), HKD interest rates rise, attracting capital inflows. This peg means that the fate of the Hong Kong Dollar is intrinsically tied to the US Dollar, making US monetary policy a significant driver of local financial conditions. However, market forces, especially interest rate differentials, can still create significant trading opportunities and challenges within this narrow band. Decoding the Carry Trade: What is it and Why Does it Unwind? At the heart of Barclays’ forecast lies the concept of the carry trade . But what exactly is it, and why is its unwinding so significant for the Forex market ? What is a Carry Trade? A carry trade is a popular strategy in the Forex market where an investor borrows money in a currency with a low interest rate and invests it in a currency with a higher interest rate. The goal is to profit from the interest rate differential, or ‘carry’. For example, if US interest rates are 5% and Hong Kong interest rates are 2%, a trader might borrow HKD at 2% and convert it to USD to earn 5%, pocketing the 3% difference, assuming the exchange rate remains stable or moves favorably. Why is Carry Trade Unwinding Now? The unwinding of a carry trade occurs when the conditions that made the trade profitable begin to reverse. Several factors can trigger this: Narrowing Interest Rate Differentials: For a long time, US interest rates were significantly higher than Hong Kong’s, making the USD/HKD carry trade (borrowing HKD, buying USD) highly attractive. However, as the US Federal Reserve signals a potential pause or even cuts in interest rates, and the HKMA maintains its policy stance, this differential narrows. Increased Volatility/Risk Aversion: Carry trades are sensitive to market volatility. If global economic uncertainty rises, investors tend to unwind these positions, seeking safer assets. This can lead to a rapid reversal of capital flows. Liquidity Shifts: Changes in global liquidity conditions, often driven by central bank policies, can also impact the attractiveness and feasibility of carry trades. When these trades unwind, it typically involves selling the higher-yielding currency (in this case, potentially USD) and buying back the lower-yielding currency (HKD) to repay the original loan. This movement of funds directly impacts the USD/HKD exchange rate. Barclays’ Crucial Forecast: Why 7.79 Consolidation? Barclays’ expectation for the USD/HKD pair to consolidate near 7.79 is a significant pronouncement, offering a specific currency outlook within the peg’s range. But what’s the rationale behind this precise prediction? What does ‘Consolidate Near 7.79’ Mean? Consolidation implies that the currency pair is expected to trade within a relatively tight range around the 7.79 level, rather than trending strongly towards either the 7.75 or 7.85 ends of the peg. This suggests a period of relative equilibrium between buying and selling pressures. Barclays’ Rationale: Barclays attributes this expected consolidation primarily to the ongoing unwinding of carry trade positions. Here’s a breakdown of their reasoning: Interest Rate Convergence: As discussed, the gap between US and Hong Kong interest rates is narrowing. With the Federal Reserve potentially pausing or even cutting rates, and the HKMA’s policy remaining stable (or even hiking if local conditions warrant), the incentive for the USD/HKD carry trade diminishes. This reduces demand for USD and increases demand for HKD as positions are closed. Liquidity Dynamics: The global liquidity environment is shifting. As central banks potentially pivot from aggressive tightening, this can influence capital flows. Hong Kong’s interbank liquidity has seen fluctuations, and the unwinding of carry trades can inject liquidity back into the HKD market, supporting its value. HKMA’s Role: The HKMA’s commitment to the peg is unwavering. As market forces push the HKD, the HKMA’s interventions serve as a strong anchor, preventing sustained breaches of the band. Barclays likely factors in the HKMA’s ability and willingness to maintain stability. This forecast provides a crucial currency outlook , suggesting that while the HKD might have been at the weaker end of the peg for some time due to carry trade flows, the reversal of these trades will help it find a more central, stable position. The Hong Kong Dollar’s Resilience: Navigating Global Headwinds The Hong Kong Dollar , despite its peg, is not immune to global economic forces. Its resilience in the face of significant headwinds is a testament to the strength of its linked exchange rate system and the HKMA’s proactive management. However, the current environment presents both challenges and strengths. Challenges for the Hong Kong Dollar: US Monetary Policy: The primary challenge stems from the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions. Historically, higher US rates have widened the interest rate differential, encouraging capital outflows from Hong Kong and pushing the HKD towards the weak end of its peg. Geopolitical Tensions: Broader geopolitical concerns can sometimes trigger capital flight or reduce investor confidence, putting pressure on the HKD. Economic Slowdown: A slowdown in Hong Kong’s economy or mainland China’s economy can impact trade flows and investor sentiment, indirectly affecting the currency. Strengths and Resilience: HKMA’s Strong Reserves: The HKMA possesses substantial foreign exchange reserves, giving it ample firepower to defend the peg through market interventions. This provides a strong psychological anchor for investors. Robust Financial System: Hong Kong’s well-regulated and liquid financial markets contribute to its stability. Unwavering Commitment to the Peg: The HKMA has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to the linked exchange rate system, reinforcing market confidence. Barclays’ forecast suggests that despite these challenges, the unwinding of carry trade positions will contribute to the Hong Kong Dollar’s stability, allowing it to navigate these headwinds more effectively and consolidate its position within the peg. Broader Forex Market Dynamics: What This Means for Global Currency Outlook The USD/HKD pair, while specific, offers valuable insights into broader Forex market dynamics and the overall currency outlook . Understanding these interconnected relationships is vital for any global investor. Signals for the Broader Forex Market: Interest Rate Expectations: The unwinding of carry trades in the USD/HKD pair is a direct reflection of changing expectations for US interest rates. If the market anticipates a dovish pivot from the Fed, similar carry trades involving other currencies against the USD might also see unwinding pressures. Global Liquidity Trends: Capital flows into and out of Hong Kong are part of larger global liquidity movements. A shift in the USD/HKD pair can signal broader trends in global risk appetite and liquidity distribution. Emerging Market Impact: Hong Kong serves as a gateway to mainland China and a significant financial hub for Asia. Stability or volatility in the HKD can have ripple effects on other Asian currencies and emerging markets, influencing their respective currency outlooks . Implications for the Global Currency Outlook: The consolidation of USD/HKD near 7.79, driven by carry trade unwinding, suggests a potential easing of USD strength in specific contexts. This doesn’t necessarily mean a broad USD decline, but rather a rebalancing of positions where interest rate differentials have been a key driver. For the broader Forex market , this could imply: Reduced Volatility in Some Pairs: As carry trades unwind, some of the speculative pressure might ease, leading to periods of reduced volatility in certain currency pairs. Focus on Fundamental Drivers: With carry trade mechanics less dominant, fundamental economic data, inflation figures, and growth prospects might regain prominence in driving currency movements. Diversification Considerations: Investors might increasingly look for diversification strategies beyond traditional interest rate differentials, considering geopolitical stability, trade balances, and long-term growth trajectories. The currency outlook remains complex, but specific forecasts like Barclays’ on USD/HKD provide crucial pieces to the global financial puzzle. Actionable Insights for Savvy Investors Understanding Barclays’ forecast and the dynamics of the USD/HKD pair offers several actionable insights for investors, from currency traders to those with broader portfolio interests. For Currency Traders: Monitor Interest Rate Differentials: Keep a close eye on the interbank interest rates (HIBOR and LIBOR/SOFR). A narrowing gap will continue to drive the unwinding of carry trades and support the HKD. Watch HKMA Actions: Any official statements or interventions from the HKMA are critical. Their actions will directly influence the USD/HKD within its peg. Range-Bound Strategies: If consolidation near 7.79 is expected, traders might consider range-bound strategies, buying near the lower end of the expected range and selling near the upper end. For Long-Term Investors and Portfolio Managers: Currency Risk Management: For those with exposure to Hong Kong assets or USD-denominated assets, understanding these dynamics helps in managing currency risk. While the peg limits extreme fluctuations, movements within the band can still impact returns. Macroeconomic Indicators: Pay attention to broader macroeconomic indicators in the US and Hong Kong, as these will ultimately influence interest rate policies and capital flows. Diversification: Consider how currency movements might impact diversified portfolios. While the HKD is pegged, its movements reflect underlying economic pressures that could affect other assets. Challenges and Risks to Consider: Unexpected Policy Shifts: A sudden, unanticipated shift in US or HKMA monetary policy could disrupt the expected consolidation. Global Shocks: Major geopolitical events or unforeseen global economic shocks could trigger risk-off sentiment, impacting capital flows. Data Volatility: Economic data can be volatile, leading to market overreactions that temporarily push the USD/HKD towards the edges of its peg. By staying informed and understanding the underlying drivers, investors can better position themselves to navigate the nuances of the Forex market and make informed decisions. Conclusion: Navigating the Tides of Global Finance Barclays’ forecast for the USD/HKD to consolidate near 7.79, driven by the unwinding of carry trade positions, offers a compelling glimpse into the sophisticated interplay of global finance. This prediction underscores the crucial role of interest rate differentials, liquidity, and central bank policies in shaping the currency outlook , even for a pegged currency like the Hong Kong Dollar . As investors, whether focused on traditional assets or the burgeoning crypto market, understanding these intricate dynamics is no longer optional but essential. The stability of the USD/HKD within its band, influenced by these powerful forces, reflects broader shifts in the global Forex market , signaling a period of rebalancing and careful observation. Staying abreast of these developments will empower you to make more informed decisions in an increasingly interconnected financial world.

Speaking at the KBW 2025 Blockchain Conference, Hayes said there is a strong possibility that BTC could rise to $250,000 by the end of the year as the global money supply increases. The famous name suggested that interesting market developments could emerge between the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter, and these could push BTC to new heights. Hayes attributed Bitcoin's potential rally to the Treasury's anticipated increase in money supply and the Fed's expected interest rate cuts. He said the Treasury is planning an expansionary foreign exchange policy, and the Fed is expected to implement a series of ongoing interest rate cuts. Hayes emphasized that these factors combined with inflationary pressures could drive investors towards Bitcoin, which has a limited supply of 21 million coins. Arthur Hayes recently argued that US President Donald Trump's influence on Fed policy could prolong the bullish cycle. The famous name stated that Trump would appoint people who support his policies to the Fed board in the future and would ultimately try to print more money to ensure economic expansion. Hayes ultimately argued that Trump's proposed change at the Fed could lead to more aggressive money-printing policies, further increasing liquidity and benefiting riskier assets like Bitcoin. In his previous statements, Hayes predicted that Bitcoin would reach $250,000 by the end of 2025, while Ethereum would shake up the market and reach $10,000.

The revised S-1 filing, submitted to the SEC, details Coinbase as the chosen broker and custodian. If approved, the DOGE ETF will trade under the ticker GDOG on NYSE Arca. This filing follows the SEC’s recent approval of new standards for crypto funds, which could streamline the launch of multiple exchange-traded products in the coming months. Against this backdrop, attention is turning to whether Mutuum Finance (MUTM) can outperform Dogecoin and position itself as the next crypto to hit $1. Dogecoin ETF Progress The submission of Grayscale’s updated S-1 comes amid heightened ETF activity in the crypto market. NYSE Arca has also proposed updates for Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust and its mini version to align with simplified SEC rules. These changes build on the SEC’s approval of listing standards, including the requirement that digital assets should have a futures market regulated in the United States for at least six months. Because Dogecoin already has futures and options trading on regulated exchanges, Grayscale is arguing that DOGE qualifies for this structure. Despite this progress, the firm is not yet offering in-kind creation and redemption, which could limit flexibility for institutional investors. Nevertheless, the push for a Dogecoin ETF signals broader acceptance of meme tokens in structured financial products. Yet while DOGE gains a regulated pathway, investors are considering whether its growth potential matches that of newer altcoins like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035, a 250% increase from the opening phase price of $0.01. So far, $16,200,000 has been raised, and 16,500 holders have joined. The presale is selling out fast, and once Phase 6 ends, Phase 7 will open at $0.04, marking a 14.3% rise. At launch, MUTM will list at $0.06, meaning current buyers can secure returns of 371% after listing. The project is not just relying on hype. It is building a decentralized lending and borrowing platform where users can earn yield on deposits or unlock liquidity against existing holdings. Overcollateralization, liquidation safeguards, and borrow caps ensure that the system remains stable during volatile market swings. Borrowers can choose variable or stable rates, and deposit caps further protect against outsized exposure. This risk-focused framework is helping Mutuum earn credibility in the crypto investment space. Security And Incentives Mutuum Finance has passed its CertiK audit at 90/100, indicating a high security posture of the token scan. Additionally, the team rewards managed to kickstart a Bug Bounty Program with a total reward pool of $50,000 USDT to be distributed across four levels. This ensures that, in the long term, even the smallest loopholes are fixed by building trust in the protocol. The project has also announced a giveaway for MUTM, which is worth $100,000 , which is split among 10 winners to receive $10,000 each. To be qualified, participants need to invest minimum at least $50 in the presale and perform simple tasks, and provide a wallet address. Mutuum also has a leaderboard dashboard whereby the top 50 holders will receive bonus tokens for holding their position. These efforts are building momentum for engagement within the community and providing some hard-set rewards for early adopters. Why Mutuum Is Gaining Traction Mutuum Finance is already separating itself from older tokens by focusing on practical use cases. Its borrowing and lending structure relies on Chainlink oracles for price accuracy, while fallback oracles and aggregated feeds ensure continuity. This reliability is vital for protecting liquidity during market swings. Consequently, MUTM is gaining traction as not just another new crypto coin, but a project anchored in tested DeFi mechanisms. Moreover, while Dogecoin waits on ETF approval, MUTM is giving direct exposure to a utility-driven model in active presale stages. The platform’s roadmap includes an over-collateralized stablecoin, further expanding its role in DeFi lending. These developments are encouraging crypto investing discussions around MUTM as one of the best cryptos to buy now, especially given the structured tokenomics and growing presale numbers. Looking Ahead To The Next Crypto To Hit $1 Mutuum Finance has been proving that new crypto coins with real utility can capture market interest quickly. Dogecoin’s ETF path may bring it more legitimacy, but MUTM’s presale momentum, security milestones, and lending use case are driving strong demand today. The fact that Phase 6 is nearing completion underscores how rapidly investors are moving in. Therefore, while Grayscale’s DOGE ETF submission signals another step for meme coins, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as the altcoin that could realistically emerge as the next crypto to hit $1. Those entering now are locking in a price point that could deliver substantial returns when the token officially launches.

For investors and traders, including those deeply engaged in the cryptocurrency space who understand the ripple effects of macroeconomics, understanding traditional currency movements is paramount. When major institutions like Barclays offer updated thoughts, it signals a crucial juncture for market participants. The USD RUB forecast from Barclays provides a lens through which to view the complex interplay of economics, geopolitics, and market sentiment, offering critical insights into what might lie ahead for the Russian Ruble against the mighty US Dollar. Understanding the Russian Ruble ‘s Resilience and Vulnerabilities The journey of the Russian Ruble over recent years has been nothing short of extraordinary. From periods of significant depreciation following geopolitical events and sanctions to surprising rebounds, its trajectory is a testament to both its inherent vulnerabilities and unexpected resilience. For many, the Ruble’s movements are often seen as a barometer for global geopolitical stability and the impact of commodity prices, particularly oil and gas. Historically, the Ruble’s value has been intrinsically linked to Russia’s vast natural resource exports. High oil prices often provide a strong tailwind, boosting export revenues and strengthening the currency. Conversely, dips in commodity markets can exert considerable downward pressure. However, recent years have introduced new, more complex variables into this equation: Geopolitical Tensions: Escalating international sanctions and political disputes have repeatedly tested the Ruble’s stability, often leading to sharp, sudden declines. Central Bank Intervention: The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has played a pivotal role, employing various monetary policy tools, including interest rate adjustments and capital controls, to stabilize the currency. Domestic Economic Factors: Inflation, economic growth, and government spending policies also contribute significantly to the Ruble’s fundamental valuation. Barclays’ analysis often delves deep into these factors, seeking to identify the underlying drivers that will shape the Ruble’s performance in the coming months. Their updated thoughts typically reflect a nuanced understanding of how these forces interact, providing a more comprehensive picture than a simple commodity-driven model. Barclays’ Updated USD RUB Forecast : What to Expect? When a global financial powerhouse like Barclays issues an updated USD RUB forecast , it’s not just another market prediction; it’s a meticulously crafted outlook based on extensive research and proprietary models. While specific figures are not provided here, we can infer the typical components and considerations that would go into such an analysis. Barclays would likely offer a short-term and medium-term outlook, considering various scenarios. Their forecast would typically hinge on several key assumptions and data points: Oil Price Projections: Given Russia’s reliance on oil exports, Barclays would factor in their crude oil price forecasts, assessing the potential impact on Russia’s current account balance. Global Economic Growth: A stronger global economy generally implies higher demand for commodities, which could support the Ruble. Conversely, a slowdown could weaken it. Geopolitical Developments: Any anticipated shifts in international relations, sanctions regimes, or military conflicts would be carefully weighed for their potential to trigger capital flight or bolster confidence. CBR Monetary Policy: Expectations regarding the CBR’s interest rate decisions and any potential currency interventions would be crucial. Higher rates typically attract foreign capital, strengthening the Ruble. Fiscal Policy: The Russian government’s spending and revenue plans, especially in response to economic challenges, would also be integrated into the forecast model. A hypothetical Barclays forecast might present a range for USD/RUB, perhaps suggesting a gradual appreciation or depreciation depending on the interplay of these factors. For instance, they might highlight a scenario where sustained high oil prices and a hawkish CBR could lead to Ruble strength, or conversely, a downturn in global growth coupled with increased geopolitical risk could see the pair move higher. Navigating the Forex Market : Strategies for Traders For individuals trading in the Forex market , especially those accustomed to the volatility and rapid movements in crypto, the USD/RUB pair presents unique opportunities and challenges. Understanding expert analysis like Barclays’ can significantly inform trading strategies, allowing for more calculated decisions. Here are some actionable insights for navigating this complex currency pair: Stay Informed on Geopolitics: The Ruble is highly sensitive to news related to international relations. Keeping abreast of political developments and sanctions news is critical. Monitor Commodity Prices: Pay close attention to crude oil prices (e.g., Brent and WTI). A strong correlation often exists between oil price movements and the Ruble’s value. Follow Central Bank Announcements: The Central Bank of Russia’s interest rate decisions and forward guidance are major market movers. Understand their stance on inflation and economic stability. Risk Management is Key: Due to the potential for sudden, sharp movements, robust risk management strategies, including stop-loss orders and appropriate position sizing, are essential. Consider Diversification: For those with broader portfolios, including cryptocurrencies, understanding traditional Forex pairs like USD/RUB helps in assessing overall market risk and identifying potential hedging opportunities. While the allure of quick gains is strong in any volatile market, a disciplined approach, informed by comprehensive analysis, remains the most sustainable path to success. Barclays’ insights provide a foundational layer for this disciplined approach, offering a macro perspective that individual traders might miss. The Pervasive Geopolitical Impact on Currency Dynamics It’s impossible to discuss the USD/RUB pair without extensively addressing the profound geopolitical impact . Unlike many other major currency pairs primarily driven by economic fundamentals, the Ruble’s fate is often intertwined with global power dynamics, international relations, and regional conflicts. This makes it a fascinating, albeit challenging, currency for analysis. Key geopolitical factors that exert significant influence include: Geopolitical Factor Potential Impact on Ruble Barclays’ Consideration International Sanctions Weakens Ruble, restricts capital flow, increases perceived risk. Assesses existing sanctions’ effectiveness and potential for new ones. Energy Supply Dynamics Stronger Ruble with high demand/prices; weaker with disruptions/low prices. Analyzes global energy policy, production cuts, and supply chain security. Trade Relations Improved trade ties can boost economic activity and currency. Monitors trade agreements, tariffs, and diplomatic relations. Regional Conflicts Increases uncertainty, capital flight, and risk premium for the Ruble. Evaluates stability in Eastern Europe and other areas of Russian influence. Global Power Shifts Can alter investment flows and geopolitical alliances, impacting confidence. Considers long-term shifts in global economic and political power. Barclays’ updated thoughts would meticulously dissect these factors, providing scenarios based on different geopolitical trajectories. For instance, a de-escalation of tensions could lead to a more optimistic outlook for the Ruble, while renewed friction could trigger a more cautious or bearish stance. This nuanced approach helps clients understand the full spectrum of risks and opportunities. Expert Barclays Analysis : Key Drivers and Risks The core of any reliable market outlook, particularly for a volatile pair like USD/RUB, lies in robust, expert analysis. Barclays analysis stands out due to its comprehensive approach, combining quantitative models with qualitative assessments of market sentiment and geopolitical realities. Their updated thoughts would likely focus on identifying the key drivers that are expected to dominate the currency pair’s movement, alongside a thorough examination of potential risks. Key Drivers Identified by Barclays (Hypothetical): Commodity Market Stability: A stable or rising trajectory for oil and gas prices provides a fundamental floor for the Ruble. Domestic Economic Reforms: Any credible efforts by Russia to diversify its economy and improve its investment climate could attract foreign direct investment, supporting the currency. Global Risk Appetite: In periods of high global risk appetite, investors may be more willing to take on exposure to emerging market currencies, including the Ruble. Central Bank Credibility: The CBR’s ability to manage inflation and maintain financial stability is crucial for investor confidence. Potential Risks Highlighted by Barclays (Hypothetical): Escalation of Sanctions: Further tightening of international sanctions could severely impact Russia’s economy and financial system. Sharp Decline in Oil Prices: A sustained drop in crude oil prices would directly hit Russia’s export revenues and government budget. Global Recession Fears: A significant global economic downturn would reduce demand for commodities and increase risk aversion, negatively impacting the Ruble. Domestic Political Instability: Internal political shifts or social unrest could deter investment and lead to capital outflows. Barclays’ insights are invaluable because they don’t just present a single forecast; they often provide a range of probabilities for different outcomes, equipping investors with the tools to prepare for various market conditions. This holistic view is what makes their updated thoughts so influential in the financial community. Challenges and Opportunities in the USD/RUB Landscape The USD/RUB currency pair is a landscape of both significant challenges and intriguing opportunities. For investors, understanding this duality is key to navigating its volatile waters. Challenges: Unpredictable Geopolitical Environment: The sudden shifts in international relations can make long-term forecasting extremely difficult. Political events often override economic fundamentals in the short term. High Volatility: The Ruble’s susceptibility to external shocks means it can experience rapid and substantial price swings, increasing trading risk. Limited Market Access for Some: Depending on the prevailing sanctions, certain international investors might face restrictions or higher costs when trading the Ruble. Dependence on Commodities: While a strength during commodity booms, this dependence becomes a significant vulnerability during downturns, leading to boom-bust cycles. Opportunities: High Yield Potential: Russia’s relatively high interest rates, especially during periods of inflation, can offer attractive carry trade opportunities for investors willing to take on currency risk. Commodity Price Leverage: For those with a bullish outlook on global commodity prices, the Ruble can serve as a proxy for exposure to this theme. Diversification: For sophisticated investors, the Ruble can offer a diversification play, as its drivers are somewhat distinct from major developed market currencies. Event-Driven Trading: The Ruble’s responsiveness to news and events creates opportunities for nimble traders who can react quickly to geopolitical or economic announcements. Barclays’ analysis helps dissect these challenges and opportunities, providing a framework for investors to assess their risk appetite and potential returns. Their updated thoughts often include a strategic perspective on how to position oneself given the prevailing market conditions and anticipated developments. Conclusion: The Enduring Significance of Expert Analysis The USD/RUB currency pair remains a focal point for global financial markets, a complex tapestry woven from economic data, commodity prices, and an ever-evolving geopolitical landscape. Barclays’ updated thoughts offer a vital compass in this often-turbulent environment, providing deep, informed perspectives that transcend mere speculation. For anyone involved in financial markets, from seasoned Forex traders to cryptocurrency enthusiasts seeking to understand broader market dynamics, paying attention to such expert analysis is crucial. It underscores the interconnectedness of global finance and highlights how traditional currency movements can signal broader economic health or instability, indirectly influencing everything from investment flows to risk sentiment across all asset classes, including digital assets. As the world continues to navigate complex economic and political currents, insights from institutions like Barclays will remain indispensable for making informed decisions and understanding the critical factors shaping our financial future.

Speaking at the JP Morgan India Investor Conference, Dimon expressed skepticism about the Fed’s ability to cut rates significantly while inflation remains “ stuck at 3% ” rather than the central bank’s 2% target. Source: YouTube Multiple Economic Pressures Keep Inflation Elevated Dimon’s comments came as Federal Reserve officials themselves cast doubt on additional rate cuts, with St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem stating there is “ limited room for easing further ” and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic suggesting the September cut may be the only reduction needed this year. The Fed cut rates by 25 basis points to 4.00%-4.25% in September, but internal divisions emerged over the pace of future reductions. The banking chief cited multiple inflationary pressures, including global fiscal deficits, the potential for world remilitarization, trade restructuring, and potentially reduced immigration to the United States. BREAKING: FED President Raphael Bostic expects no further rate cuts this year after the September rate cut. pic.twitter.com/SH1zT9kxuK — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) September 22, 2025 He argued that these factors could push wages higher while creating sustained price pressures that complicate the Fed’s dual mandate of maintaining stable prices and achieving full employment. Meanwhile, Dimon dismissed banking industry concerns about stablecoins threatening traditional deposit bases, calling blockchain technology “ real ” while distinguishing between legitimate applications and speculative crypto trading. His measured stance contrasts sharply with that of other major bank executives, who have warned of a deposit flight similar to the 1980s money market fund crisis. Fed Faces Inflation Reality Check as Officials Split on Cuts Federal Reserve officials are increasingly acknowledging that the central bank’s September rate cut may have been premature, given the persistent inflation pressures above the 2% target. Dimon’s inflation concerns align with statements from multiple Fed officials who now question the wisdom of additional monetary easing in the near term. New Fed Governor Stephen Miran, appointed by President Trump, advocated for aggressive rate cuts totaling 1.25 percentage points across the remaining 2025 meetings. Miran argued that the neutral interest rate has fallen due to tariffs, immigration restrictions, and tax policies, making current rates “ roughly 2 percentage points too tight ” and risking unnecessary unemployment. However, regional Fed presidents pushed back against dovish policy prescriptions. Musalem warned that further rate cuts could make policy “ overly accommodative ,” while Bostic emphasized concerns about inflation remaining “ too high for a long time ” as justification for maintaining restrictive monetary policy. St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem signals he may need to see continuing weakness in the labor market to justify additional cuts. Musalem: I supported the decision to cut last week “as a precautionary move” intended to support a full employment labor market. Policy is… — Nick Timiraos (@NickTimiraos) September 22, 2025 The internal Fed debate stemmed from uncertainty about economic conditions, with unemployment remaining low while consumer spending patterns suggested stress among lower-income households. Credit losses are increasing moderately, though Dimon characterized this as “ weakening ” rather than a “ disaster ” requiring emergency monetary intervention. Market expectations for two additional quarter-point cuts by year-end face growing skepticism from policymakers who prioritize inflation control over labor market support. The median Fed projection supports gradual easing, but seven officials now favor no additional cuts, creating potential for policy gridlock if economic data remains mixed. Stablecoin Wars Heat Up as Banks Fight Digital Dollar Competition On the other hand, Dimon’s dismissive stance on stablecoin banking threats contradicts intensive lobbying efforts by major banking associations seeking to restrict digital dollar competition. Five major U.S. banking trade organizations have urged Congress to tighten regulations under the GENIUS Act , warning that stablecoin platforms offering competitive yields could trigger a mass deposit flight. Citigroup analysts compared current dynamics to the 1980s crisis when money market funds expanded from $4 billion to $235 billion in seven years , draining traditional bank deposits as customers chased higher returns. Banking groups cite Treasury estimates suggesting yield-bearing stablecoins could trigger $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows, fundamentally altering bank funding mechanisms. Coinbase and other crypto platforms continue to offer stablecoin yields despite pressure from the banking industry, arguing that prohibitions apply only to issuers, not intermediaries. Not only that, they also face practical challenges as stablecoins offer payments up to 13 times cheaper than traditional systems with instant settlement capabilities. The stablecoin market has grown from $4 billion in 2020 to over $285 billion today, with projections reaching $1 trillion in annual payment volume by 2030. Coinbase published a defense against banking claims that stablecoins threaten financial stability, calling the ""deposit erosion"" narrative a ""myth"" protecting banks' $187 billion monopoly. #Coinbase #Stablecoin https://t.co/Kpshr7e1K2 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 16, 2025 Recent research from Coinbase found no meaningful correlation between stablecoin adoption and deposit flight for community banks over the past five years, contradicting warnings from the banking industry. The debate intensifies as major corporations, including Amazon and Walmart, reportedly consider stablecoin integration to reduce transaction costs. Average U.S. savings accounts yield 0.6%, while stablecoin platforms offer returns of up to 5%, creating competitive pressure that traditional banks struggle to match. Dimon’s pragmatic approach acknowledges that stablecoin infrastructure will develop naturally as legitimate payment technology, with JPMorgan positioned to provide custody services and Treasury management for digital dollar reserves.

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana. You’ll be able to build token programs, LP logic, oracles, games, NFT infrastructure, DAOs, and much more. All without reinventing the wheel. To engage with the L2, you’ll deposit $BTC to a designated address monitored by the Canonical Bridge. The Relay Program verifies the details, and then mints an equivalent number of wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can also withdraw your original $BTC at any time. If you’re looking for the newest insights on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper, you’re in the right place. We update this page regularly throughout the day with the latest insider insights for Bitcoin maxis and Bitcoin Hyper fans. Keep refreshing to stay ahead of the pack!

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Bitcoin is down 2% this week, but unless you’re restricting yourself to lower timeframe charts, you wouldn’t be too disappointed with its performance so far. Why? On the weekly chart, Bitcoin is now creating a picture-perfect hammer candle right on its most recent support zone, marked by the blue rectangle in the image below. As you can see, this is the same zone that previously acted as strong resistance: once in December 2024, again in January 2025, and most recently in May 2025. And then it flipped into an important support level. This zone has since fueled both Bitcoin’s August all-time high run and its latest September rally. So, all in all, if the weekly candle closes where it is right now, or even pushes a little higher/lower, Bitcoin could be excellently set up to first retest its latest swing high of $118K and then potentially push past toward new all-time highs. Even better, on the daily chart, Bitcoin is neatly bouncing from the golden Fibonacci zone. i.e., the area between the 0.5 and 0.618 level, suggesting that it has had the perfect amount of pullback and is now ready to push up.

Momentum, a prominent decentralized exchange (DEX) and liquidity hub, has just announced a monumental achievement: its cumulative Momentum trading volume has soared past an incredible $12 billion. This isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful testament to the platform’s rapid growth and its crucial role within the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape, showcasing its expertise and reliability to a global audience. What Fuels Momentum’s Phenomenal Trading Volume on Sui? Momentum isn’t just any DEX; it stands as the largest ve(3,3) decentralized exchange within the vibrant Sui ecosystem. This unique positioning has been a key driver behind its impressive success. The ve(3,3) model, at its core, is designed to create a highly efficient and sustainable liquidity environment. It achieves this by aligning incentives for liquidity providers and token holders, encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term gains. This mechanism ensures deep and stable liquidity pools, which are fundamental for any high-volume trading platform. The platform’s user-friendly interface, coupled with Sui’s high-throughput and low-latency blockchain, has attracted a significant user base. Traders on Momentum benefit from competitive fees and minimal slippage, even for substantial trades. For example, a user looking to swap a large amount of SUI for USDC can do so efficiently, thanks to the robust liquidity provided by the ve(3,3) framework. Consequently, these factors combine to consistently drive up the overall Momentum trading volume , solidifying its position as a go-to platform for crypto enthusiasts seeking reliable and efficient trading solutions. The Significance of a $12 Billion Momentum Trading Volume Surpassing $12 billion in cumulative trading volume is more than just an impressive statistic; it’s a clear indicator of trust, reliability, and widespread adoption within the competitive DeFi space. This massive figure demonstrates that users are confidently choosing Momentum for their trading needs, from simple token swaps to more complex liquidity provisions. It signifies that the platform can handle substantial activity without compromising on performance, a critical factor for institutional and retail traders alike. Furthermore, this milestone highlights the maturity and burgeoning potential of the Sui ecosystem itself. As Momentum thrives, it brings more attention and capital to Sui, fostering further innovation and development across the entire network. The sustained growth in Momentum trading volume acts as a magnet, attracting more projects, developers, and users. This creates a virtuous cycle of expansion within DeFi, establishing Sui as a serious contender in the blockchain arena. This volume also provides valuable data, enabling Momentum to continually optimize its offerings and maintain its competitive edge. Navigating the Future: Opportunities and Growth for Momentum With such a significant achievement under its belt, what lies ahead for Momentum? The platform is exceptionally well-positioned for continued innovation and expansion. We can anticipate further enhancements to its trading features, potentially including more advanced analytics tools, improved user experience interfaces, and even broader asset support to cater to a diverse range of cryptocurrencies. Community engagement will also play a crucial role, with governance initiatives likely empowering users to shape the platform’s future direction, fostering a truly decentralized ethos. Maintaining this impressive Momentum trading volume will require continuous adaptation to the evolving DeFi landscape. Challenges such as navigating complex regulatory changes and intense competition from other DEXs are ever-present. However, Momentum’s strong foundation, coupled with its commitment to the ve(3,3) model and the robust Sui blockchain, provides a solid framework for navigating these complexities. This strategic approach allows them to capitalize on new opportunities, such as integrating with other DeFi protocols or exploring new yield-generating strategies, ensuring sustained growth in the decentralized finance space. In summary, Momentum’s achievement of over $12 billion in cumulative trading volume is a landmark event. It underscores the platform’s effectiveness as a leading DEX on Sui and showcases the growing strength of the entire ecosystem. This milestone is not merely a reflection of past success but a strong indicator of Momentum’s future potential to drive innovation and adoption in the exciting world of decentralized finance, solidifying its authority and trustworthiness. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Momentum? Momentum is the largest ve(3,3) decentralized exchange (DEX) and liquidity hub operating within the Sui (SUI) blockchain ecosystem. It facilitates cryptocurrency trading and liquidity provision. What does the ve(3,3) model mean for a DEX like Momentum? The ve(3,3) model is a tokenomics design that aligns incentives for liquidity providers and token holders. It encourages long-term staking and participation by rewarding users who lock their tokens, leading to deeper and more stable liquidity pools on the exchange.

It indicates the platform’s ability to handle large transactions efficiently with minimal slippage, reinforcing its reliability and importance in the DeFi sector. What is the Sui ecosystem? Sui is a high-performance, Layer 1 blockchain designed for speed and scalability. It provides a robust and efficient infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps), including DEXs like Momentum, enabling fast and low-cost transactions. How does Momentum ensure liquidity on its platform? Momentum ensures deep liquidity primarily through its ve(3,3) tokenomics model, which incentivizes users to provide and lock liquidity.

According to TradingShot’s analysis, the maiden cryptocurrency is testing its 20-week moving average ( MA ) near $112,500, a level that has historically acted as a launchpad for the final leg of previous bull cycles. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView In the analysis shared on TradingView on September 22, the analyst noted that based on historical data, whenever Bitcoin closed below the 1W MA20, the price tended to decline further until finding support at the 50-week MA. Currently, the 1W MA50 sits just under $100,000, suggesting that a decisive weekly close beneath the 1W MA20 could trigger a correction to that level within two to three weeks. Based on prior cycles, TradingShot projects this move could materialize within that same timeframe. The broader structure highlights the parabola of the ongoing 2023–2025 bull cycle, with higher highs forming along an ascending trajectory. However, projections indicate a more complex pattern, with a significant test of the 1W MA50 likely around late January 2026. This timing aligns with cyclical tops and retracements observed in previous market phases. If Bitcoin holds above the 1W MA20, the bullish outlook remains intact, with potential upside toward $130,000 in the near term. But if the trendline breaks, downside pressure could quickly drive the asset below six figures, setting up a deeper consolidation before the next rally. Bitcoin price analysis At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $113,075, up 0.6% in the past 24 hours, though down 3.5% over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At the current price, Bitcoin is hovering just below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $114,614 but remains well above the 200-day SMA of $103,830. This positioning suggests that the market is consolidating, with short-term momentum lagging behind the medium-term average, while the long-term trend remains firmly bullish. Meanwhile, the asset’s 14-day RSI of 44.43 shows Bitcoin is neither overbought nor oversold, leaning toward the lower neutral zone, which reflects subdued buying pressure.

Here’s What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-and-xrp-often-fall-within-the-formal-payment-system-heres-what-it-means/,"Crypto researcher SMQKE emphasized a key distinction in the regulatory treatment of leading digital assets. In a recent post, SMQKE stated that Bitcoin and Ethereum fall outside of formal payment systems, while Ripple and XRP often fall within. The researcher underscored the point by adding that this status is formally documented and attached supporting material to reinforce the statement. Don’t forget: Bitcoin and Ethereum FALL OUTSIDE OF FORMAL PAYMENT SYSTEMS. Meanwhile, Ripple and XRP often FALL WITHIN THE SYSTEM. Of course it’s documented. https://t.co/erFKbZXfu1 pic.twitter.com/tXtHjmZCtn — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 20, 2025 Supporting Documentation The attached document excerpt focuses on how different jurisdictions classify and integrate cryptoassets. It explains that whether a cryptoasset is recognized as part of the formal payment system depends on how it is intended to be used within a specific jurisdiction. The highlighted section notes explicitly that Bitcoin and Ether often fall outside such systems, whereas Ripple and XRP frequently fall within them. The explanation clarifies that this is linked to the structure of formal payment systems, which are generally closed-loop networks governed by established rules, participants, and oversight mechanisms. When a cryptoasset can be incorporated into such a framework, it can serve as a settlement vehicle rather than being limited to the role of a medium of exchange. The same excerpt highlights that formal payment systems are subject to regulatory scrutiny, usually under standards set by international institutions such as the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures of the Bank for International Settlements. This indicates that recognition within such systems carries additional oversight and compliance expectations. Implications of the Distinction The statement supported by the documentation points to an important operational and legal difference. Assets that fall outside of formal payment systems, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, tend to function independently of regulated clearing and settlement frameworks, often being viewed as alternative or parallel systems. In contrast, assets such as XRP , when recognized within formal systems, can be positioned for use in settlement processes under existing regulatory structures. This integration implies a higher degree of alignment with established financial frameworks and the potential for usage in formalized institutional contexts. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Jurisdictional Considerations The document also makes clear that treatment of cryptoassets is not uniform across all jurisdictions. The decision on whether a particular asset is included in a formal payment system depends on local regulations and the specific role the asset is intended to play. Some jurisdictions have adopted more facilitative approaches, integrating certain assets within their legal frameworks, while others maintain exclusivity for sovereign currencies or apply stricter prohibitions. SMQKE’s post draws attention to an officially documented distinction in the treatment of leading crypto assets. The supporting material explicitly states that Bitcoin and Ethereum are often classified outside of formal payment systems, while Ripple and XRP are frequently recognized within them. This classification highlights the differing roles these assets occupy in regulatory and operational contexts. This illustrates how integration into formal payment systems depends on jurisdictional decisions and the intended function of the asset.

Legendary game creator Kojima, who is known for Konami’s Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding franchises, unveiled new details about his next projects during Kojima Productions’ 10th anniversary livestream in Japan, including the new Xbox title and the beginnings of a PlayStation exclusive codenamed Physint . Kojima presented OD Knock ’s first trailer, which introduced actress Sophia Lillis, known from Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves , as the protagonist. The game will also feature Euphoria star Hunter Schafer and veteran actor Udo Kier, although their roles are unknown as of now. OD Knock is powered by Unreal Engine Unlike Kojima’s previous title, Death Stranding , which used Sony’s Decima engine, OD is being built using Unreal Engine. UE has been heavily criticized for its graphical shortcomings, but Kojima said the technology will make the upcoming Xbox exclusive “one step higher than Death Stranding 2.” Xbox chief Phil Spencer was also part of the livestream, and confirmed Microsoft was technically involved in the new IP’s development, adding that it was “well underway.” “OD is bold, it’s unique, and it’s unmistakably from this studio,” Spencer said. “We’re deeply supporting the production. It’s our technical work on Unreal that we’re doing with the team, both with the flashy [elements] you see on the screen, but also a lot of the behind-the-scenes work.” Kojima gave the audience a subtitle for the project: Knock . He explained that the concept comes from his personal fear of knocking sounds. “ I am afraid of the ‘knock’ sound, so I wanted to make that very frightening, ” he said. The developer teased that filmmaker Jordan Peele is also collaborating on the OD experience. He did not clarify if Peele is directing a portion of the project or overseeing a specific episode. Kojima joked about his experimental mind, saying he wants to “win an award” for being the first to “motion-capture a ghost.” For all players and screamers The OD Knock trailer opened with an ominous red door, unlocked using a mysterious red card with a partially redacted text that stated: “Ten years since the [REDACTED] Horror [REDACTED], “[REDACTED].” The Cursed [REDACTED] Have Once Again [REDACTED] Into the Forbidden. Light the Fires to Celebrate Their [REDACTED] [REDACTED]. This Building Was [REDACTED] From a 3D Scan of an [REDACTED] Found in an [REDACTED]. And then, [REDACTED] Were [REDACTED] In a Sinister Ritual.” Gameplay showed a stormy day, with Lillis’ character entering a shrine-like room. She struck a match from a box labeled “missing” and began lighting candles. When she lit one candle shaped like a baby, it triggered the sound of crying. Another, shaped like a young person’s head, began to bleed when lit. Protagonist Lillis hears the sound of the door opening. Source: Kojima Productions OD Knock Trailer The sequence culminated in Lillis shaking and tearing up in fear as a malevolent figure approached from behind and grabbed her head, causing her to scream. Kojima described OD as a project that straddles the line between video game and cinema. New PS exclusive also announced, but with fewer details Beyond the Xbox project, Kojima Productions also shared a poster for Physint , a new PlayStation exclusive. Kojima said development had only just begun and that he was personally working on concepts, characters, and casting. “It is just the start,” he told the audience. Sony executive Herman Hulst appeared in a video message supporting Kojima. Physint Poster: Source: Kojima Productions Beyond the Strand Livestream The game developer said Physint is “the next stage tactical espionage action game,” a theme that defined his Metal Gear franchise while at Konami. The main protagonist of the game is still unknown, but three actors have been listed on the cast, including Charlee Fraser, who starred in Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga ; Don Lee, known as Gilgamesh in Marvel’s Eternals ; and Japanese actress Minami Hamabe, who appeared in Godzilla Minus One . OD is already in active development, but the studio reiterated that Physint is far from release. In May, Kojima suggested the project was “another five or six years” away, meaning he could be targeting a release on the upcoming PlayStation 6 console.

This trend, highlighted by leading analytics firm CryptoQuant, points towards a growing sense of unease and a potential shift in market dynamics. Understanding this behavior is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile world of digital assets, as it reveals key insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. Are Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Experiencing Panic Selling? Recent data from CryptoQuant reveals that Bitcoin short-term holders have indeed entered a phase of realizing losses. The Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) for this specific group, an on-chain metric that measures the profit or loss on coins sold, has dipped below one. When SOPR falls below this threshold, it typically signals that sellers are realizing losses, often indicative of panic selling in the market. This metric is a powerful tool for understanding the psychological state of recent investors. SOPR below one: This means that, on average, coins are being sold for less than their original purchase price. Market Sentiment: A SOPR below one provides a clear snapshot of negative market sentiment among recent investors. Impact on Price: Such trends can significantly influence broader market psychology and short-term price action, potentially leading to further downward pressure if panic intensifies. This widespread loss-taking among Bitcoin short-term holders reflects a growing lack of confidence in immediate price recovery, pushing many to exit their positions even at a financial detriment. Understanding the Staggering Losses Faced by Whales It’s not just the everyday Bitcoin short-term holders feeling the pinch; even the market’s largest players, known as whales, are incurring substantial losses. CryptoQuant’s analysis indicates that new whales, those who have recently acquired large amounts of Bitcoin, have collectively lost an estimated $184.6 million. Existing whales, long-term holders with significant capital, have also seen losses totaling $26.3 million. This significant outflow of capital at a loss underscores a widespread “risk-off” sentiment across the market. A “risk-off” sentiment means investors are actively reducing their exposure to perceived riskier assets, like cryptocurrencies, and moving towards safer investments such as stablecoins or traditional safe-haven assets. This behavior often emerges during periods of heightened market uncertainty, economic instability, or when investors anticipate further price declines, reflecting a cautious and defensive approach from even the most seasoned and capitalized investors. Why is the Average Purchase Price a Key Support for Bitcoin Short-Term Holders? Despite the current selling pressure and widespread losses, there’s a crucial point of interest for Bitcoin short-term holders . CryptoQuant highlights that BTC is currently trading near the average purchase price for this cohort. Historically, this specific level has proven to be a robust support zone during times of heightened volatility and market downturns. It represents a significant psychological and technical floor where many short-term investors initially bought into Bitcoin. When the price approaches this average, it can trigger several market reactions. Firstly, it might entice new buying interest from those who believe the asset is currently undervalued. Secondly, existing holders might use this level to “average down” their positions, buying more Bitcoin at a lower price to reduce their overall average cost. This dynamic can potentially stabilize the price and prevent further significant drops, offering a crucial lifeline and a potential turning point for the market. What Does This Mean for the Future of Bitcoin Short-Term Holders and the Market? The current behavior of Bitcoin short-term holders and whales suggests a period of market capitulation. While often painful for investors, such phases can frequently precede a market bottom and subsequent recovery. These periods of intense selling and loss realization tend to “flush out” weaker hands, paving the way for a more stable base from which the market can rebuild. For those holding Bitcoin, understanding these underlying on-chain dynamics is key. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective over reacting to short-term fluctuations driven by panic. The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, and periods of loss realization are a natural, albeit challenging, part of its cyclical nature. Monitoring key indicators and understanding historical patterns can help investors make more informed decisions during these turbulent times. In conclusion, the current wave of selling by Bitcoin short-term holders and whales at a loss signifies a challenging period for the cryptocurrency market. However, the proximity to historical average purchase prices offers a potential point of stabilization. While panic selling is evident, the market’s resilience has been tested before, making this a critical juncture for observation and strategic decision-making. Staying informed about these on-chain indicators is paramount for navigating the path ahead and understanding where Bitcoin might be headed next. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action. Frequently Asked Questions About Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Here are some common questions regarding the current market situation: What does it mean when Bitcoin short-term holders are selling at a loss? It means that investors who bought Bitcoin relatively recently (typically within the last 155 days) are selling their assets for a price lower than what they paid for them. This often indicates a lack of confidence in the immediate market outlook and can be a sign of panic selling. What is the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) and why is it important? SOPR is an on-chain metric that shows whether the average coin spent on a given day was sold at a profit or a loss. A SOPR value below one indicates that, on average, coins are being sold at a loss. It’s important because it provides insight into the overall market sentiment and capitulation levels. Why are whales also selling at a loss alongside Bitcoin short-term holders? Whales, or large-scale investors, selling at a loss suggests a broader “risk-off” sentiment in the market. Even these significant players are choosing to reduce their exposure to Bitcoin, often due to macroeconomic concerns, fear of further price declines, or a strategic reallocation of capital to less volatile assets. How does the average purchase price act as a support zone for Bitcoin? The average purchase price for a cohort of investors (like short-term holders) often acts as a psychological and technical support level. When the price drops to this level, it can attract new buyers or encourage existing holders to buy more, believing it to be a good entry point or an opportunity to average down their cost, thus preventing further price declines. What is “risk-off” sentiment in the crypto market? “Risk-off” sentiment refers to a market environment where investors reduce their exposure to higher-risk assets (like cryptocurrencies) and instead seek out safer, less volatile investments. This shift is typically driven by uncertainty, fear of economic downturns, or anticipated market instability. Share Your Thoughts Did you find this analysis helpful?

Cardano remains one of the most mature proof-of-stake blockchains, with a steady pace of upgrades and a passionate community that funds its long-term vision. Cardano (ADA) offers stability, but considering its size, the scale of returns may be less dramatic in the next bull cycle. Meanwhile Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a nascent DeFi token priced at $0.035 in presale and based on a lending-and-borrowing protocol. With real utility and considerably more room to grow, many investors consider MUTM the better blast-off opportunity down the pike in 2025. Cardano’s Price & Outlook Going into Q4 2025 Cardano (ADA) is trading at around $0.90. The price action has been showing slight weakness lately, day-over-day movement is small, and it’s encountering resistance around the zone of $0.90-$1.00. Support is stronger near the $0.80-$0.85 zone, so ADA appears to be consolidating rather than breaking out. While its proof-of-stake model, peer-review development, and rising developer activity are good fundamentals, its size translates to dollar-returns that are perhaps more stable than explosive. In comparison to ADA’s mature profile, Mutuum Finance, is being looked at by investors as having greater bull run potential being a newcomer in the market. Mutuum Finance Presale Impresses Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leading its sixth presale round whereby it is breaking records as investors converge. The project has already reached more than 16,500 investors and has crossed the $16.2 million capital threshold. The trend will only continue to expand. Record-breaking achievements such as these are a good sign of increasing confidence in the project. Investors who invest now can earn humongous returns in the long term as the ecosystem keeps expanding. The project is attractive to investors because it has dual lending mechanism, open-source and audited codebase, and open tokenomics. Mutuum Finance is anticipating growth in the DeFi space in the long term. The project is rewarding early adopters by operating a $100,000 giveaway campaign, where 10 users of the platform will be given $10,000 MUTM tokens. The project is set to be one of the leading ETH-based DeFi projects to watch in 2025. Building a Secure Platform Mutuum Finance has taken it to another level to provide security on its platform and collaborated with CertiK to introduce an official bug bounty program with a minimum assured reward pool of $50,000. The four levels of severity of the reward are critical, major, minor and low in a way where all types of vulnerabilities could be reported and removed. By opening up third-party audits from developers and researchers on its website, Mutuum is also opening up its latest security technology, another security and guarantee to its investor base. Mutuum Loan to Value and liquidation ratios that are contingent on the volatility of underlying collateral are the primary source of stability. Reserve multipliers ranging from a 10% safer through to 35% of risk assets are the second source of stability. The system is so finely balanced with access and safety. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is standing out as one of the best cryptos to watch heading into Q4 2025, offering explosive upside compared to larger-cap coins like Cardano (ADA). Currently in Stage 6 of its presale at $0.035, MUTM has already raised over $16.2 million and attracted 16,500+ investors, underscoring rising confidence. Backed by an audited open-source code, dual lending protocol, $50K CertiK bug bounty, and $100K community giveaway, the project has strong fundamentals with early-stage growth potential. While ADA has stability, MUTM possesses the kind of early entry opportunity that can lead to outsized returns in the next bull cycle. Lock in your tokens now before the price appreciates during Stage 7.

52144303,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=825629,1758627004,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52144303.jpeg,"Bitcoin Price Could Still Crash To $99,000 If This Happens, Warns Ostium Labs",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-price-crash-99000-if-this-happens-ostium-labs/,"Ostium Research’s latest weekly note opened with Bitcoin under pressure after a swift selloff into the new week, describing “a mass liquidation event” that pushed price as low as $111,761, after rejection near resistance in the mid-$117,000s. The team frames the drawdown as part of a previously flagged “window of weakness… into early October,” while stressing the higher-timeframe uptrend remains intact unless key weekly levels fail. The report, published September 22, 2025, sets out both the technical map and the event calendar that could govern path-dependency over the next several sessions. Bitcoin Crash To $99,000 Looms On the weekly chart, Ostium notes last week’s consolidation around the August open and a wick into “key resistance… at $117.5k,” followed by a close marginally below the open. Early-week price action then carried price beneath reclaimed support into the $111k handle, with the analysts highlighting “over $1.6bn in longs liquidated so far today.” Two structural inflection zones anchor the bearish risk: “Acceptance below $107k on a weekly close would open up more downside into $99k,” whereas on the topside “the weekly high at $115.3k… is at least revisited some time later in the week.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Signals ‘Fear’ As Price Falls To $112,000 On the daily timeframe, the August open at $115.7k is the pivot the market must reclaim to reassert momentum. As the authors put it, “that August open at $115.7k [is] a key level to flip into support to resume bullishness.” The immediate battleground is the prior all-time high at $112k, where “a reclaim of $112k as support” would tilt probabilities toward a higher low and force shorts to cover into a move back through $115.7k. Their base case, however, is for additional chop “between $112k-$115k before a second push lower below today’s low,” which will determine whether the market undercuts the June swing at $107k or marks out a bottom sooner. Tactically, Ostium lays out both long and short triggers with unusual clarity. On the long side: “a sweep of today’s low early this week and then a reclaim of $112k as support,” riding momentum “back into the weekly high.” On the short side, they float what they call “a really nice short setup… a sharp v-reversal… back above the weekly high… before… rejecting and breaking back below $115.3k,” which would then target “$112k and lower.” In other words, a squeeze-then-fade path that punishes both late longs and late shorts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck In Neutral While Markets Roar — Analyst Explains Why Positioning and derivatives breadth round out the near-term blueprint. The note shares snapshots of 3-month annualized basis, Bitcoin versus altcoin open interest, and one-week/one-month liquidation maps, underscoring how quickly liquidity pockets can flip into magnets in thin conditions. This informs their near-term expectation that “the next leg lower or second liquidation event this week [could] be a high probability low,” followed by a retest of $115.3k that will act as the tape’s verdict on whether another down-leg or a bear-trap reversal is in play into quarter-end. The house view remains probabilistic rather than doctrinaire. If $107k fails on a weekly close, the weakness window could extend into “$99k”; if it holds—and especially if the market can “flip $115.7k into support”—the higher-low narrative stays alive. In the authors’ words, for Ethereum “nothing about this higher timeframe structure or momentum is currently giga-bearish,” and, by analogy, Bitcoin’s structure is best judged by the reaction around $111.7k–$112k this week. Whether today’s flush proves to be prelude to capitulation or the trap before new highs, Ostium’s bottom line is clear: “we move much higher from early October” unless those weekly thresholds are accepted lower. At press time, BTC traded at $113,002.

The Seoul Metropolitan Police Economic Crime Investigation Division announced the arrest of 25 members of “Lungo Company,” which operated from a resort in Pattaya, Thailand. Multi-method crypto scam targets 878 Korean victims Lungo Company was a criminal group from July 2022 until July 2023 when it swindled 21 billion won ($15.1 million) with well-organized schemes of fraud. The group split into special teams, which dealt with various methods of scams unlike the usual rings, which deal with a single approach. Police officers indicated that the strategy stood out from the previously used schemes by the criminals. The romance scamming group stole photos and used them to create fictitious profiles for social media sites and disguised themselves as potential love interests. The victims were slowly persuaded into investing money into fake sites after forming attachments. Yet another expert team used a stolen database from a lottery number suggestion portal to attack chosen victims. The hackers approached victims posing as those providing refunds or compensation for the leakage of personal data from the exploited platform. The victims were thus lured into buying bogus cryptocurrency during the fake compensation transaction. The group also operated fake reservation scams and impersonated public institutions to trick victims into financial transfers. Each team maintained detailed victim profiles and communication logs to coordinate their deception efforts. The leaders maintained strict discipline for all members by taking away passports and imposing communication restriction. The members were not allowed to exit the Pattaya resort facility as telephones were also strictly monitored. Advanced money laundering techniques exploit cross-chain networks Crypto security expert analysis reveals the Lungo Company used “multi-layered laundering” techniques to hide stolen funds. The organization likely used chain-hopping tactics to quickly swap funds across different blockchains to complicate transaction tracking. Cross-chain crime has tripled globally in the past two years through decentralized exchange exploitation. The criminals exploited nested services within regulated exchanges and operated unauthorized trading platforms that hide connections to legitimate infrastructure. These “parasite exchanges” process nearly 100 times more illicit volume than their host platforms while charging premium fees between 7% and 15% for anonymity services. Shell companies opened accounts across multiple major exchanges using fraudulent credentials. Chain-swapping techniques forced investigators to spend extensive time manually tracing funds across multiple protocols and networks. The organization converted various cryptocurrencies across different blockchain networks to break audit trails. No-KYC coin swap services and cross-chain bridges facilitated rapid anonymous transfers throughout the laundering process. Money laundering operations likely included crypto-funded prepaid cards for ATM withdrawals and casino laundering to produce legitimate-appearing winnings. Micro-transactions were split into thousands of small transfers to stay below automated detection thresholds. Final cash-out procedures almost certainly involved unregulated over-the-counter brokers in Thailand and neighboring jurisdictions. These services provided high-volume cash conversion with minimal regulatory scrutiny. Coordination occurred through encrypted messaging applications like Telegram and WeChat to avoid law enforcement monitoring. International cooperation leads to arrests and extradition efforts Thailand police raided the first resort back in June and detained a few suspects prior to the joint operations with Seoul police widening the scope of investigation. The ringleader and eight central members are currently detained in Thai custody as South Korea seeks their extradition via diplomatic means. The vast majority of the suspects transferred to Korea beforehand are detained and actively investigated. Yim Jung-wan, lead of the second economic crime investigation unit, also verified investigators are looking into links between the ringleader and other fraud rings . The case illustrates increasing transnational cooperation against cross-border crypto crime as customary jurisdictional limits matter less. The Thai and Korean law enforcement agencies exchanged intelligence and coordinated arrest operations in more than one spot. The investigation comes days after a Seoul police sting last month busted a multinational cybercrime syndicate accused of robbing $28.1 million from wealthy Koreans. That racket had victimized high-profile targets including BTS sensation Jungkook and other top corporate bigwigs by stealing from financial accounts. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Bên cạnh sự tăng trưởng mạnh mẽ của Bitcoin, nhiều altcoin cũng đang ghi nhận đà tăng giá mạnh mẽ và thu hút sự chú ý của nhà đầu tư toàn cầu. Trong số đó, các altcoin và meme coin tiềm năng đang trở thành tâm điểm. Các nhà phân tích đã chỉ ra 5 dự án có khả năng đạt vốn hóa 10 tỷ USD trong làn sóng tăng trưởng năm 2025: Pepe (PEPE) Sui (SUI) Aptos (APT) Litecoin (LTC) Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Pepe (PEPE) Pepe (PEPE) là một meme coin lấy cảm hứng từ nhân vật internet “Pepe the Frog”. Tại thời điểm viết bài, PEPE đang giao dịch ở mức 0,00001829 USD với vốn hóa 7,6 tỷ USD. Bất chấp biến động thị trường, đồng coin này vẫn cho thấy sự ổn định đáng kể. Nhờ các giao dịch mua lớn từ cá voi và việc niêm yết trên những sàn giao dịch lớn như Coinbase, khối lượng giao dịch của PEPE đã đạt mức kỷ lục 5,4 tỷ USD. Các tín hiệu kỹ thuật cho thấy giá đã tăng tới 280% trong xu hướng đi lên, gợi ý khả năng tiếp tục bứt phá. Chiến lược phát triển do cộng đồng dẫn dắt và sự quan tâm mạnh mẽ trên mạng xã hội được kỳ vọng sẽ là động lực tăng trưởng trong thời gian tới. Một số chuyên gia dự đoán PEPE thậm chí có thể vượt qua Shiba Inu (SHIB) và tiến tới vốn hóa 10 tỷ USD. Sui (SUI) Sui (SUI), đồng coin gốc của mạng lưới Sui, đã ghi nhận sự tăng trưởng ấn tượng trong thời gian gần đây. Ngày 18/11, giá SUI đạt mức cao kỷ lục 3,93 USD. Tại thời điểm viết bài, đồng coin này đang giao dịch ở mức 3,31 USD với vốn hóa thị trường 9,39 tỷ USD — tức đã tăng hơn 800% so với mức giá thấp nhất trước đó. Công nghệ blockchain của dự án, cho phép giao dịch nhanh và hiệu quả, đã nhận được sự đánh giá cao từ cả người dùng lẫn nhà phát triển. Hoạt động trên mạng lưới Sui đang bùng nổ, khi số lượng ví sử dụng và khối lượng giao dịch đều đạt mức kỷ lục, cho thấy sức hút ngày càng lớn. Dù từng gặp sự cố ngừng hoạt động toàn bộ vào ngày 21/11, mạng lưới đã được khôi phục trong vòng khoảng 2 giờ và hiện vận hành bình thường. Các nhà phân tích dự đoán, nhờ nền tảng công nghệ vững chắc và hệ sinh thái ngày càng mở rộng, vốn hóa của Sui sẽ sớm vượt mốc 10 tỷ USD. Aptos (APT) Aptos (APT) là một dự án blockchain Layer-1 được phát triển bởi các cựu nhân viên của Meta (Facebook). Sau khi phục hồi về mức giá quý 1, APT hiện đang giao dịch ở mức 11,92 USD với vốn hóa thị trường 6,36 tỷ USD. Đà tăng trưởng chung của thị trường đã giúp APT bứt phá, với mức tăng 128% chỉ trong vòng một tháng qua. Cả mức cao lẫn mức thấp đều đang tăng dần, cho thấy sự ổn định và sức hút mạnh mẽ đối với nhà đầu tư. Aptos có biến động giá khá giống với Sui, và các nhà phân tích dự báo APT có thể tiến gần mốc 20 USD trong tương lai gần. Với ngưỡng hỗ trợ vững chắc quanh mức 11 USD, nhiều chuyên gia tin rằng vốn hóa của APT có thể đạt 10 tỷ USD trong đợt bull run tiếp theo. Litecoin (LTC) Litecoin (LTC), một trong những đồng tiền điện tử đời đầu, đang lấy lại vị thế trong bối cảnh thị trường tăng giá. Tại thời điểm viết bài, LTC được giao dịch ở mức 94,2 USD với vốn hóa 7,08 tỷ USD, nhờ tính ứng dụng cao và uy tín lâu năm. Các quan hệ hợp tác doanh nghiệp và hồ sơ ETF đang mở rộng phạm vi sử dụng của Litecoin, đồng thời củng cố đánh giá của giới đầu tư về nó như một tài sản ổn định. Bên cạnh đó, kỳ vọng vào sự kiện halving năm 2027 càng làm tăng triển vọng dài hạn của đồng coin này. Với nền tảng vững chắc và động lực từ thị trường sôi động, các nhà phân tích cho rằng Litecoin có thể sớm vượt qua cột mốc 10 tỷ USD vốn hóa trong giai đoạn tăng trưởng tiếp theo. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) là một altcoin mới nổi, được xem như phiên bản nâng cấp của Bitcoin với khả năng mở rộng, tốc độ giao dịch cao và sức mạnh cộng đồng. Dự án được xây dựng trên hạ tầng blockchain tiên tiến, hướng đến hệ sinh thái phi tập trung nhưng hiệu quả. Hiện tại, HYPER đang nhận được sự quan tâm lớn từ các nhà đầu tư tổ chức. Tính đến nay, cá voi đã chi khoảng 15 triệu USD để mua 2,1 triệu token HYPER thông qua nền tảng Hyperliquid, cho thấy niềm tin mạnh mẽ vào tiềm năng tăng trưởng của dự án. Giá giao dịch hiện ở mức 0,00714 USD/HYPER. Dù vẫn đang trong giai đoạn đầu, Bitcoin Hyper đã tạo được tiếng vang trên các cộng đồng crypto và mạng xã hội. Các chuyên gia dự đoán đồng coin này có thể nhanh chóng đạt vốn hóa 10 tỷ USD trong đợt bull run 2025. Đợt presale dự kiến kết thúc vào ngày 20/12, sau đó HYPER sẽ được niêm yết trên sàn giao dịch, thúc đẩy thanh khoản và tiềm năng tăng giá.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|APT|LTC|BTC|PEPE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-23 11:33:41

U.S. delegates met with Chinese leaders to discuss trade and security in the first U.S. House delegation to China since 2019. The rare earths dispute between the United States and China remains unresolved, despite a series of high-level meetings in Beijing this week. Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, confirmed that talks have not led to progress on the issue. U.S. and China fail to iron out rare earths dispute Smith is leading the first official U.S. House delegation to China since 2019. The visit included meetings with Premier Li Qiang and other senior officials. A major goal of the visit is to stabilize relations ahead of a potential meeting next month between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping in South Korea. At a press briefing on Tuesday, Smith acknowledged that no breakthrough on the dispute had been reached. “I don’t think we resolved the rare earth question. I think that still needs to be worked on,” he said. Back in June, China and the United States reached an agreement, under which Beijing committed to reviewing applications for exports of rare earth magnets. Few details of that deal have been disclosed, but Trade Representative Jamieson Greer recently said that rare earth shipments to the U.S. had “bounced back up significantly.” Meanwhile, European manufacturers have complained of shortages and have warned that supply constraints could disrupt production across several industries. Dialogue continues about trade, TikTok, and aircraft deals Beyond minerals, the delegation also discussed technology and trade. Smith was asked whether TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance Ltd., would maintain any role in the app’s U.S. algorithm under the pending arrangement. He described the matter as “not 100% resolved” and cited ongoing concerns about privacy and security, though he noted that he was not directly involved in negotiations. The Trump administration has been pushing for TikTok’s U.S. operations to be separated from ByteDance and placed under American ownership. According to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, the emerging deal would give a consortium led by Oracle Corp. majority control of the platform, though many details have yet to be finalized. Another major item on the agenda is a long-awaited Boeing Co. aircraft order . The U.S. Ambassador to China David Perdue told reporters the two governments are in the final stages of negotiating what he described as a “huge” purchase that is years in the making. Security concerns were also addressed during the discussions. Smith pressed Chinese officials on what he described as Beijing’s rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal. “When you’re getting up into the hundreds, close to 1,000 on nuclear weapons, it’s time to start having a conversation,” he said . Smith added that deeper military-to-military communication was critical and that he had delivered this message directly in meetings with Chinese leaders. The delegation raised other sensitive issues, including the flow of fentanyl precursors from China, which Washington has linked to America’s opioid crisis, and the need for fairer market access for U.S. companies operating in China. In the coming days, the group is scheduled to meet with National People’s Congress Chairman Zhao Leji and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, according to Vice Premier He Lifeng.

52145342,587473,1758627680,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52145342.jpeg,Bitcoin News: Was die Ruhe bei BTC für Michal Saylor bedeutet,https://bitcoinist.com/ruhe-bei-bitcoin-bedeutet-saylor-strategy/,"Bitcoin zeigt weniger Kursschwankungen und stabilisiert sich. Michael Saylor sieht das als Zeichen für Reife und für den Einstieg großer Investoren. Neue Finanzprodukte sollen Bitcoin in den Kreditmarkt bringen. Viele Menschen verbinden Bitcoin mit wilden Kursschwankungen. Doch Michael Saylor, Chef von Strategy, sieht die aktuelle Ruhe als Stärke. Er glaubt, dass gerade diese Entwicklung mehr große Investoren anziehen wird. Gleichzeitig arbeitet seine Firma daran, Bitcoin für den Finanzmarkt noch interessanter zu machen. Warum Bitcoin gerade stiller wird Michael Saylor sagt, dass die seit einiger Zeit recht ruhigen Kurse von BTC kein Grund zur Sorge sind. Er sieht darin ein Zeichen, dass sich der Markt beruhigt und erwachsener wird. Viele, die schon sehr früh Bitcoin gekauft haben, verkaufen nun kleine Teile, um Dinge wie ein Haus oder ein Studium zu bezahlen. Das bedeutet nicht, dass sie den Glauben an Bitcoin verlieren. Es ist vergleichbar mit Mitarbeitern in jungen Firmen, die ihre Anteile verkaufen, um Geld für ihr Leben zu nutzen. Gleichzeitig zeigt der Chart, dass BTC im letzten Jahr fast doppelt so viel wert wurde – trotz der Ruhe. Lies hier eine langfristige Bitcoin Prognose von einer Partnerseite. Von frühen Käufern zu großen Anlegern Die ersten Bitcoin-Fans, die schon für wenige Dollar gekauft haben, nutzen ihre Gewinne. Das schafft Platz für neue Käufer, erklärt Saylor. Vor allem große Investoren wie Fonds und Unternehmen warten ab, bis die Schwankungen kleiner werden. Je stabiler BTC wird, desto mehr Vertrauen entsteht. Große Anleger sehen weniger Risiko und sind bereit, mehr Geld zu investieren. Damit beginnt laut Saylor eine neue Phase, in der BTC noch stärker in die Finanzwelt hineinwächst. Warum fehlender Gewinn kein Nachteil ist Ein häufiger Vorwurf ist, dass BTC keine Gewinne wie Aktien bringt. Saylor widerspricht: Auch Gold, Land oder Kunst haben keine regelmäßigen Einnahmen, sind aber wertvoll. Der Wert von Bitcoin liege nicht in Zinsen oder Dividenden, sondern in seiner Seltenheit und Sicherheit. Für viele klassische Anleger ist das noch ungewohnt. Sie denken in alten Mustern aus Aktien und Anleihen. Doch laut Saylor werden sie sich umstellen müssen, weil BTC eine eigene Form von Wert darstellt – ohne laufenden Gewinn, aber mit wachsender Bedeutung. Neue Ideen für den Finanzmarkt Um Bitcoin für Investoren noch attraktiver zu machen, entwickelt Strategy neue Produkte. Diese nutzen BTC als Sicherheit für Kredite. Sie heißen zum Beispiel „Strike“ oder „Stride“ und sollen feste Zinsen von bis zu zwölf Prozent bieten. Strategy Preferred Product Comparison Table $STRF v $STRC v $STRK v $STRD pic.twitter.com/yqKAcnh6DB — Chris Millas (@ChrisMMillas) July 23, 2025 Das Prinzip: Anleger geben Geld, Strategy hinterlegt BTC als Sicherheit. Weil diese Sicherheit sehr hoch ist, soll das Risiko kleiner sein. So bekommt Bitcoin eine Art „Cashflow“ – also Einnahmen – und passt besser in die klassische Finanzwelt. Bitcoin als Teil der Zukunft Saylor ist überzeugt, dass BTC eine wichtige Rolle in der Finanzwelt übernehmen wird. Er vergleicht es mit den Anfängen großer Industrien, die mit vielen neuen Ideen starteten. Er glaubt, dass BTC in den kommenden Jahrzehnten jedes Jahr im Schnitt fast 30 Prozent im Wert steigt. Auch andere Experten glauben, dass BTC bis Ende des Jahres noch eine krasse Rally machen wird. Für Saylor ist es klar, dass Bitcoin nicht nur ein Finanzthema ist. Er sieht es als fairen Weg, um Werte auszutauschen. Für ihn ist es ein Werkzeug, das langfristig für mehr Frieden und Gerechtigkeit sorgen könnte. Hoffen wir, das Michael Saylor mit seiner Prognose Recht behält. Während BTC und ETH als sehr große und einflussreiche Kryptowährungen schon ihren Platz im System gefunden haben, sollten sich risikobewusste Investoren auch immer neuen, unbekannteren Projekten öffnen. Eins davon ist sicherlich der Memecoin Pepenode, der in den letzten Wochen immer mehr an Momentum aufnimmt. Revolutionäre Utility mit Pepenode Pepenode ($PEPENODE) ist der erste Mine-to-Earn Memecoin auf Ethereum und bringt Mining in ein völlig neues, virtuelles Format. Statt teurer Hardware starten Nutzer mit einem digitalen Serverraum, den sie mit Mining Nodes füllen können. Diese lassen sich kaufen, upgraden oder wiederverkaufen, was hohe Flexibilität bietet. Durch clevere Kombinationen der Nodes steigert man sein Mining-Yield und nimmt aktiv an einem dynamischen DeFi-Ökosystem teil. Leaderboards, Gamification und Belohnungen in $PEPE und anderen Memecoins schaffen Wettbewerb und Community-Hype. Schon in der Presale-Phase profitieren Investoren von attraktiven Staking-APYs, die aus einfachem Halten eine strategische Entscheidung machen. Hier kommst du zu einer detaillierten Analyse von Pepenode bei einer Partnerseite! Warum jetzt investieren lohnt Während die Kryptomärkte wieder Aufschwung erleben – vor allem durch das steigende Interesse von Unternehmen und Institutionen – profitiert auch Pepenode von diesem Momentum. Mit seiner Kombination aus Mining, Staking und Gamification bietet $PEPENODE nicht nur Spaß, sondern auch echte Utility und langfristige Nachfrage. Besonders im Umfeld sinkender Zinsen fließt mehr Kapital in Altcoins zurück – ein perfekter Nährboden für Projekte mit innovativen Mechanismen wie Pepenode. Wer früh einsteigt, sichert sich hohe Staking-Rewards und den Vorteil, mit voller Mining-Power in den Launch zu starten.

At the forefront of this transformation is Fnality, a pioneering entity that has just made headlines with a significant funding announcement. They are building a revolutionary blockchain payment system designed to bring unparalleled efficiency and security to global finance. Fnality’s Remarkable $136 Million Funding Round: A Vote of Confidence In a powerful demonstration of institutional confidence, blockchain payments startup Fnality recently secured an impressive $136 million in its Series C funding round. This substantial capital injection was spearheaded by major financial players including Bank of America, Citi, and WisdomTree, as reported by Cointelegraph. Such backing from established giants signals a strong belief in Fnality’s vision and the potential of its underlying technology to reshape the financial landscape. The company’s primary objective is clear: to construct a robust, blockchain-based payment system. This innovative infrastructure will be directly linked to central bank reserves, ensuring stability and trust within the digital realm. It represents a critical step towards integrating distributed ledger technology (DLT) into the core of traditional finance, moving beyond speculative cryptocurrencies to practical, enterprise-grade solutions. What Makes This Blockchain Payment System a Game Changer for Global Finance? Traditional payment systems often grapple with inefficiencies, high costs, and delays, particularly in cross-border transactions and wholesale markets. Fnality’s approach aims to directly address these long-standing issues. By leveraging blockchain technology, they are paving the way for a new era of financial settlements, enabling faster, cheaper, and more secure transactions. Here’s why this initiative is so significant for financial institutions: Instantaneous Settlements: Payments can settle in real-time, drastically reducing the delays common in current systems, which often take days for interbank transfers. Reduced Counterparty Risk: The atomic nature of blockchain transactions minimizes the risk between parties by ensuring that payment and asset transfer occur simultaneously. Lower Operational Costs: Automation and streamlined processes, facilitated by smart contracts on the blockchain, can lead to substantial cost savings for financial institutions by cutting out intermediaries and manual reconciliation. Enhanced Transparency and Security: Distributed ledgers provide an immutable and auditable record of transactions, boosting both transparency and security while reducing fraud. Central Bank Integration: Linking directly to central bank reserves offers a stable, reliable, and compliant foundation for digital payments, addressing concerns about volatility and regulatory oversight. This advanced blockchain payment system is not just an incremental improvement; it is a foundational shift. It seeks to create a more resilient, efficient, and interconnected global financial ecosystem, ultimately enhancing market liquidity and stability. Navigating the Future of Digital Payments with a Robust Blockchain Payment System The path to revolutionizing global payments is not without its challenges. While the potential is immense, several hurdles must be addressed. Regulatory clarity across different jurisdictions, seamless interoperability with existing legacy financial infrastructures, and broad institutional adoption are crucial. Fnality must also ensure robust cybersecurity measures and scalability to handle the vast volumes of global transactions. However, the strong support from leading global banks indicates a collective push towards embracing this future. This isn’t just about moving money; it’s about reimagining financial processes. For example, Fnality’s system could enable more efficient collateral management, accelerate securities settlement, and streamline foreign exchange transactions, thereby reducing capital requirements and operational complexities for banks. The capital raised will empower Fnality to accelerate its development, expand its talented team, and further refine its technology to meet stringent financial industry standards. This investment is a testament to the growing acceptance of blockchain as a legitimate and transformative force in the financial industry, moving beyond speculative assets to practical, enterprise-grade solutions that deliver tangible value.

The project’s latest post shows total staked STRK increased by 23% this month to over 571 million coins, worth roughly $70.9 million at market price. Starknet @Starknet · Follow total STRK staked grew +23 % this month.higher I guess. 1:30 pm · 23 Sept 2025 142 Reply Copy link Read 27 replies The amount represents approximately 14% of the altcoin’s circulating supply. That’s a crucial milestone since Starknet launched staking late last year. Moreover, the breakthrough comes days after the Ethereum-based L2 rolled out Bitcoin staking on its mainnet. Increased staking signals the community’s dedication to removing STRK coins from circulation. Strong momentum amid market volatility. The soaring staking within the Starknet ecosystem coincides with broader market headwinds. The digital assets sector has seen wild price swings this month, with bears limiting upside actions. Nevertheless, Starknet displays resilience as more individuals commit their assets to the platform. The 23% uptick in staking shows users adopting a long-term approach, likely prioritising network incentives and governance perks over short-term price action. Such trends could enrich STRK’s market dynamics and stabilise the token through reduced selling pressure. STRK price outlook Starknet’s native token mirrored broad market movements. It has lost roughly 12% on its monthly chart to trade at $0.1204. Chart by CoinMarketCap STRK’s bearish outlook coincides with broad market weakness. Digital assets started the week on a bearish foot as post-rate cut hype faded. Now, projects are repositioning for another leg up, especially ahead of “Uptober.” While staking isn’t (directly) correlated to price growth, it can enhance STRK’s tokenomics. Locking a substantial amount of supply means fewer coins available for trading. That can lead to a supply squeeze amid demand resurgence and stable price actions. Backend developer Greek Talk commented on Starknet’s surging staking: What we’re seeing right now is early believers locking in their positions and setting the stage for what could be one of the most powerful scarcity-driven cycles in crypto. The market is often slow to catch on, but numbers don’t lie. STRK remains poised for substantial recoveries amid broader rallies. Impressive staking returns might attract more participants into the Starknet ecosystem. What is next for Starknet The L2 is experiencing notable momentum amid ecosystem maturity. Recently, Starknet launched the Grinta upgrade in its pursuit of decentralisation. With increasing user activity, Starknet might consider introducing more incentives to attract more users. The community can expect upgrades like enhanced yield mechanisms to increase staking returns and governance features that offer users more control. Also, developers may accelerate to make the L2 cheaper and faster for daily transactions. Such technical upgrades would likely boost STRK demand as more applications launch and user engagement heightens within the Starknet ecosystem.

Bitcoin’s movement always makes a wave, and this recent drop comes as Ethereum and Cardano too are seeing new updates that keep investors in suspense. As investors adapt to these changes, other ventures like Remittix (RTX), which is available at $0.1130 per token, are gradually gaining momentum in 2025 as a potential gateway between traditional finance and crypto. BTC Price and Market Reactions Bitcoin remains the backbone of the crypto universe and its selling price recently hit bottom at $112,698, decreasing by 2.09%. Although declining, trading volume went ballistic with $57.01 billion, a 143.72% rise. This trading increase means that despite the fact that the BTC Price is under pressure, liquidity in centralised exchanges and decentralized exchanges remains high. With a market capitalization of $2.25 trillion, Bitcoin still maintains its dominance, but volatility remains to hinder long-term investors as well as short-term traders. Ethereum and Cardano Figures Ethereum, typically the cornerstone of decentralized finance, trading at around $4,157, down 6.02%. Its market capitalization at $506.81 billion and volume at $49.27 billion (up 160.53%) show just how active Ethereum markets are. Ethereum Fusaka updates’ interest rides on another layer of interest as Ethereum is viewed by the majority as at the epicenter of crypto staking and Layer 2 solutions for scaling. Cardano also witnessed volatility, changing hands at $0.83, lower by 6.65%. The project market cap is $29.66 billion, while the trading volume soared with $2.23 billion, a growth of 172.46%. Cardano price analysis is still a point of contention among analysts because ADA is struggling to hold on to its position as one of the top-performing crypto below $1 with minimal gas fees and real-world adoption potential. Remittix Momentum in 2025 While BTC Price, Ethereum, and Cardano take center stage, investors are now following Remittix (RTX) more closely as a new altcoin to follow. The Remittix DeFi project has already raised more than $26.3 million, selling 669 million+ tokens, with upcoming listings already lined up on BitMart and LBank. Some key milestones are: CertiK Verified: #1 ranked Pre-Launch Token on CertiK. Beta Wallet Testing: Community testing is live, providing a real-world crypto payments bridge. Presale Success: More than $26.3M raised, ranked among the best crypto presales 2025. Referral Bonuses: 15% referral scheme and $250,000 giveaway incentivize early adopters. With its gas fee minimalist design, instant worldwide payments, and cross-chain support, RTX is not just a presale hype token. Its vision to bridge crypto to bank accounts in over 30 countries makes it stand out as a project offering crypto with real utility and not speculation. The decline in BTC Price, Ethereum market fluctuations and Cardano price prediction show the speed at which the crypto space can change. While these old-guard participants keep weathering volatility, Remittix shows how new crypto initiatives are building the future. With the union of real-world usage, decentralized exchange functions and future centralized exchange listings, RTX is showing itself to be one of the leading DeFi projects 2025, a low cap crypto gem with growing market attention.

Are Avalanche (AVAX), Near Protocol (NEAR), and Sei (SEI) good possibilities for decent rallies? Not likely. Keep an eye on Bitcoin Before taking positions in any altcoins right now it is incumbent on all traders to assess in which direction Bitcoin (BTC) is likely to go over the next day or two. At present, it looks as though the $BTC price could be recovering from its recent dip. That said, it is by no means certain that there won’t be further downside in order to shake out the longs that are betting on the recovery. $AVAX about to roll over? Source: TradingView On a very uncertain trading day the $AVAX price is up around 2.4% so far. That said, it can be seen that the price has stopped short of the $36 horizontal resistance and may be about to start the next corrective impulse. To boot, the price just failed to make a higher high. Even if there is some more upside for $AVAX , taking the trade while the 1-hour and the 4-hour Stochastic RSI indicators are on their way down would be a very risky move. As it goes, a decent retracement would be back down to the $30 horizontal support level. A stronger bounce would be more likely to occur here. If the price falls through this level, a lower low below $29.40 would be a real note of concern. Another lower low for $NEAR Source: TradingView The $NEAR price appears to be falling back down after emerging above the $3 resistance level. This was turned into support for a while, but it seems that a lower low may have formed which looks as though it may repel the price back under $3 and turn it into resistance once again. There is still around an hour to go at time of writing in order for the bulls to turn this around and force the price back above the major level. Around $2.80 could be a decent level for a long if a retracement does take place. $SEI rejects from 18-month long trendline Source: TradingView The $SEI price is possibly about to be rejected from a small descending trendline. The price is also at a resistance level and so it might be expected that this will indeed end up being a rejection. The main descending trendline is enormous. It started back in March 2024 and forms the main trendline for the whole of this bull market. Therefore, dipping back below it after making two more lower lows is a very bad sign. For $SEI to have any chance in the longer time frame, the bulls will need to break the main trendline again, push up through the $31 horizontal resistance, and make a higher high. Even for the short-term, $SEI does not look tradeable at present. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While the numbers are staggering, the timing of the transfers were also noteworthy, as Bitcoin has been experiencing heightened volatility this week. BlackRock BTC outflows. Source: Arkham As a result, traders are speculating whether another wave of institutional sales is underway now that the broader crypto market is taking a hit as a result of shifting global monetary policy . At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading below $113,000, up 0.49% on the daily but still down 2.20% on the weekly chart. BTC 24 hour price. Source: Finbold While the market might be speculating about the future, BlackRock is still the biggest crypto fund, commanding over $87.5 billion worth of BTC. Moreover, outflows from its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) on Arkham do not mean BlackRock is speculating or dumping coins at will. Rather, spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT work through a creation and redemption process with authorized participants (APs). When investors sell ETF shares, APs redeem those shares, currently on a cash-settled basis, which requires the trust to sell Bitcoin and send cash back. That’s what shows up as an “outflow” on Arkham: Bitcoin leaving the custodian wallet ( Coinbase ) to meet redemptions. Likewise, when demand rises, inflows happen as new ETF shares are created and Bitcoin is purchased. Ethereum ETFs also see major outflows Spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) also saw substantial outflows, bleeding $76 million on Monday, September 22, with BlackRock alone being responsible for $15.1 million. The timing is once again notable, as the sales came just days after BlackRock’s $500 million buying spree and an overall $1.9 billion in net inflows last week following the Fed’s 25 basis-point rate cut. Bitcoin funds led with $977 million in inflows, extending their four-week tally to nearly $4 billion. Ethereum, on the other hand, added $772 million, lifting its year-to-date total to around $12.6 billion. The pressure is now also increased by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) new listing standards for NASDAQ, Cboe, and NYSE. These have slashed the approval times for spot crypto ETFs from over 200 days to as little as 75, which is likely to turn eyes toward potential new launches, including Solana ETFs.

This isn’t a dream; it’s the reality presented by the groundbreaking MMON Staking Gala hosted on the MEXC exchange, featuring the innovative GameFi project, MultiverseMonkeys (MMON). This event is a game-changer for enthusiasts looking to maximize their earnings and dive deeper into the world of decentralized finance. Unveiling the MMON Staking Gala on MEXC: Your Gateway to High Returns MultiverseMonkeys, an exciting Ethereum-based GameFi project, recently made waves with its announcement on X (formerly Twitter) about a spectacular MMON Staking Gala . This exclusive event, held in collaboration with the reputable MEXC exchange as part of its “Simple Earn” program, offers users an unparalleled chance to stake their MMON tokens. The core appeal? An impressive potential return of up to 200% APR, making it a highly attractive option for passive income generation. This initiative underscores a growing trend in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, where innovative projects partner with established exchanges to offer lucrative staking opportunities. For participants, it means: Significant Passive Income: Earn substantial returns on your idle MMON tokens, turning them into a productive asset. Ease of Access: Participate effortlessly through MEXC’s user-friendly “Simple Earn” platform, designed for simplicity.

How to Participate in the MMON Staking Gala and Boost Your Earnings Getting involved in the MMON Staking Gala is straightforward, even for those new to crypto staking. The process is designed to be accessible, allowing a broad range of users to benefit from the high APR. Here’s a simplified guide to help you get started on your staking journey: Acquire MMON Tokens: First, ensure you hold MMON tokens in your wallet. If not, you can typically purchase them directly on the MEXC exchange or other supported cryptocurrency platforms. Navigate to MEXC Simple Earn: Log in to your MEXC account and find the “Simple Earn” section. This dedicated area is where various staking opportunities, including the MultiverseMonkeys gala, are prominently listed. Select the MMON Staking Option: Locate the specific MMON staking pool for the gala. You’ll see detailed information about the available APR, the staking duration, and any other relevant terms and conditions. Stake Your MMON: Input the amount of MMON tokens you wish to stake into the designated pool. Confirm the transaction, and your tokens will immediately begin earning rewards, contributing to your passive income stream. It’s crucial to always review the specific terms and conditions, including lock-up periods and withdrawal policies, before committing your funds. Understanding these details ensures a smooth and rewarding staking experience. Exploring MultiverseMonkeys: The GameFi Project Behind the MMON Staking Gala The allure of the MMON Staking Gala isn’t just the high APR; it’s also rooted in the potential of the MultiverseMonkeys project itself. As an Ethereum-based GameFi endeavor, MultiverseMonkeys aims to seamlessly blend the exciting worlds of gaming and decentralized finance. GameFi projects often involve innovative play-to-earn mechanics, unique NFTs, and community governance, creating vibrant and engaging digital economies. Projects like MultiverseMonkeys contribute significantly to the broader Web3 landscape by: Innovating Gaming: Introducing new and exciting ways for players to truly own in-game assets and earn real value through their participation.

Therefore, understanding MultiverseMonkeys’ roadmap and community engagement is vital for potential stakers looking beyond just the immediate returns. Maximizing Your Crypto Earnings: A Look at APR and Risk in the MMON Staking Gala An APR of up to 200% is undoubtedly attractive, but what does it truly mean for your crypto earnings? APR, or Annual Percentage Rate, indicates the annual rate of return on an investment without the effect of compounding. In the context of the MMON Staking Gala , it represents the potential profit you could make over a year from staking your MMON tokens, before considering any fluctuations in the token’s market price. While high APRs offer significant earning potential, it’s essential to approach them with a balanced perspective. Cryptocurrency investments, especially those offering exceptionally high returns, can carry inherent risks, which include: Market Volatility: The price of MMON tokens can fluctuate significantly, impacting the overall value of your staked assets and the rewards you receive. Smart Contract Risks: Although exchanges like MEXC implement robust security measures, smart contract vulnerabilities are always a consideration in the broader DeFi ecosystem. Liquidity Risks: Understanding lock-up periods is crucial, as you might not be able to access your staked tokens immediately if you need to. Always conduct your own research (DYOR) and carefully consider your personal risk tolerance before participating in any staking program. Diversifying your portfolio and only investing what you can comfortably afford to lose are prudent strategies in the dynamic crypto market. The MMON Staking Gala on MEXC presents an exciting and potentially highly rewarding opportunity for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. With an impressive up to 200% APR, it allows participants to earn substantial passive income while supporting the innovative MultiverseMonkeys GameFi project.

The company revealed the new projections just ahead of its Investor Day, where executives sought to reassure investors with ambitious long-term goals. Market watchers are perplexed at the soft outlook The company said sales in the last half of its trading year would be 5 to 10% lower than the previous half at constant rates. This resulted in ASM shares falling about 5.9% in the early morning trade in Amsterdam, although it had forecast a flat performance. ASML Holdings jumped 3.7% as Morgan Stanley upgraded it to “Overweight” with a price target of €950 supported by AI demand and semiconductor recovery, as recently reported by Cryptopolitan . ASM said the third quarter matched expectations, but a dip in the final quarter now looks unavoidable. “This is due to lower-than-expected demand in leading-edge logic and foundry, with a mixed picture per customer, as well as lower demand in the power, wafer and analogue markets.” ASM. The warning came as a surprise to some analysts, given that Taiwan’s TSMC , the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, is pressing ahead with new processes that use ASM’s tools. “This could be the result of weakness at ASM’s other big customers, Intel and Samsung,” said Michael Roeg at Degroof Petercam. The new projections The revision means full-year growth will be at the bottom of the company’s earlier forecast of 10 to 20%. In 2024, revenue grew 12% to €2.93 billion (£2.5 billion). ASM already moving on to 2030 targets ASM is projecting 2030 revenue to surpass €5.7 billion. The company also narrowed its 2027 guidance to €3.7 billion–€4.6 billion, compared with €4 billion–€5 billion previously, reflecting currency effects. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had forecast around €4.1 billion. It also expects to maintain operating margins above 30% with compound annual growth of at least 12% ASM’s CEO Hichem M’Saad is still hopeful despite the setbacks. “The semiconductor market is on track to reach $1 trillion by the end of the decade, driven by lasting megatrends, especially AI,” he said . ASM said its strategic priorities lie with the atomic layer deposition (ALD), which it views as its growth driver and the single-wafer ALD market is expected to grow from $3 billion last year to between $5.1 billion and $6.1 billion by the year 2030. The tech firm said in another core area of epitaxy (Epi), it has gained share in the leading edge. The market is expected to expand from $1.5 billion to as much as $3.2 billion over the same period. The company also sees fresh opportunities in logic and foundry, especially with the industry shift to gate-all-around (GAA) technology. ASM estimates its potential sales in this area could rise by as much as $500 million with the move to 1.4 million chips. Management also pointed to growing prospects in memory chips, with new DRAM technologies expected to boost demand for its equipment. Also, another new strategic growth drive, ASM said advanced packing which helps in stacking and connecting chips more efficiently. Paul Verhagen, the group’s finance chief, told investors the company was sharpening efficiency measures to protect margins while expanding its manufacturing base and investing in staff. “These initiatives will keep us ahead of what’s next and deliver sustainable value for all stakeholders,” he said.

It started the year trading for fractions of a cent, around $0.000000056 . By October, it had surged to an all-time high of about $0.000088 . That represented gains in the tens of thousands of percent for early buyers. The memory of that rally still shapes how people look at new projects. Many missed SHIB, but they are now searching for the next token to deliver those returns. One coin attracting major attention today is Little Pepe (LILPEPE). At its current presale price of $0.0022, some analysts believe a similar $650 investment could grow into $65,000 if it follows a SHIB-style trajectory. Presale Momentum and Whale Accumulation LILPEPE is in stage 13 of its presale at $0.0022. According to recent data, the project has already raised over $25 million and sold over 15.8 billion tokens. This momentum shows strong market interest and suggests that stage 13 will close out soon. Stages have been selling out quickly, indicating retail demand and larger whale accumulation. Reports show that whales have been buying heavily in stage 12, likely betting on big upside once centralized exchange listings go live. The project has already appeared on CoinMarketCap, adding legitimacy and visibility. Community support is another bullish signal. LILPEPE launched a $777,000 giveaway with more than 369,000 entries. Every holder is eligible, and there is also a mega giveaway rewarding top buyers between stages 12 and 17. These incentives keep energy high and attract new participants daily. They also create viral buzz across social platforms, a proven formula for meme coin breakouts. Bullish Developments in the Ecosystem What sets LILPEPE apart is the infrastructure it is building. The team is developing a custom Layer 2 network for meme tokens. This means faster transactions and cheaper fees than many existing chains. It also includes sniper bot protection to give every investor a fairer chance when trading begins. Security has been a sticking point for new tokens. LILPEPE has already passed a CertiK audit , one of the most trusted assessments in crypto. Tokenomics are simple with zero tax on buy and sell trades. That makes it attractive for smaller investors and whales wanting to move in with size. One of the biggest advantages for LILPEPE is that it is starting from a near-zero market cap. This gives it far more upside potential than SHIB or Dogecoin, which already carry billions in value. Analysts argue that even a moderate market cap could bring returns in the thousands of percent. Excitement is also building for upcoming centralized exchange listings. The team has confirmed plans to list on two major exchanges, which could bring huge liquidity and exposure. Exchange debuts have historically been catalysts for meme tokens and may be the point when LILPEPE begins its sharpest moves. Technical Analysis and Bullish Projections Looking at the presale chart, each stage has created higher lows with steady price appreciation. From stage 1 to stage 13, early buyers are already sitting on gains of over 120%. If this pattern continues into listing, analysts believe gains of 5000% to 10000% are realistic over the short term. That is where the numbers get exciting. A $650 stake at the current presale price of $0.0022 gives about 295,000 tokens. If LILPEPE climbs to $0.22 after listings, that holding could be worth $65,000. While no one can guarantee such performance, the mix of infrastructure, security, community momentum, and market timing makes the case compelling. Conclusion In 2021, SHIB made fortunes for those who were early. Many missed that run, but now they watch closely as Little Pepe builds momentum. With its presale price at $0.0022, its Layer 2 ecosystem, anti-bot design, CertiK audit, zero-tax tokenomics, strong whale interest, and massive community giveaways, LILPEPE is shaping up as one of the most intriguing coins of 2025. If the roadmap delivers and exchange listings go live, a $650 investment today could turn into $65,000. For anyone looking to capture meme coin energy with stronger fundamentals, LILPEPE stands out as an opportunity not to overlook.

This incredible growth narrative is shaping the expectations surrounding new tokens like Little Pepe (LILPEPE). Leveraging Presale Dynamics Currently priced at a presale value of $0.0022, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has been making waves with over $25 million raised and 15.8 billion tokens already sold in its ongoing presale, which is now in stage 13. This strong market interest is indicative of both retail and institutional investors' confidence, likely sparked by substantial whale purchases during earlier stages. Community Engagement and Marketing Efforts The Little Pepe team has initiated substantial marketing efforts including a $777,000 giveaway that has attracted over 369,000 entries. Furthermore, they launched a mega giveaway , creating considerable buzz and fostering a strong community around the project. Unique Technical and Security Features Distinctively, Little Pepe is developing its Layer 2 network aimed at meme tokens, which promises enhanced transaction speeds and reduced fees. This technical advancement is complemented by sniper bot protection measures, ensuring a fairer trading environment. Moreover, the project’s commitment to security is highlighted by its successful CertiK audit , which is highly regarded in the cryptocurrency space. Future Prospects and Investor Appeal With the presale ongoing, the potential for significant returns is drawing parallels to Shiba Inu’s earlier success. Should Little Pepe (LILPEPE) emulate even a fraction of SHIB’s trajectory, early investors could see substantial gains. The absence of transaction taxes enhances its attractiveness, particularly to those who wish to make larger investments. Conclusion: A Closer Look at the Investment Potential As Little Pepe (LILPEPE) progresses through its presale stages with robust financial backing, community support, and a clear roadmap, it presents as a compelling investment opportunity reminiscent of early-days Shiba Inu. With plans for upcoming exchange listings and a growing ecosystem, this could be an opportune moment for investors seeking the next big meme coin.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) forecast that the UK’s annual inflation rate will reach 3.5% by the end of 2025, up from 2.5% last year. Core inflation, which excludes volatile items like food and energy, is expected to rise 0.6 percentage points to 3.7%. According to the OECD, headline and core inflation are projected to be the highest among G7 nations and above the G20 average. This means households will face a noticeable increase in the cost of living, driven by higher prices in shops and rising energy bills. Government braces for tax hikes amid rising prices The government will also face pressure, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves expected to announce significant tax rises in her upcoming budget on November 26. The OECD highlighted that the UK is among the economies grappling with “mounting food price pressures” and noted that an increasing number of items in the consumer price index are rising faster than the Bank of England’s 2% target . Wage growth is also “above levels consistent with inflation targets,” the report added. The UK’s stubborn inflation makes it an outlier in Europe, where average rates have fallen to around 2%. By comparison, US inflation is running at about 2.9% annually, influenced by tariffs and labor supply restrictions stemming from migrant deportations. The OECD expects US inflation to peak at 2.7% this year, down from its previous July forecast of 3.3%. Economic growth slows as fiscal discipline becomes crucial The Bank of England estimates headline inflation will peak at 4% in September, double its target level, and markets are not pricing any more interest-rate cuts for the rest of this year. The OECD has nudged its growth forecast for the UK from 1.3% to 1.4% in 2025, making it the second fastest-growing G7 economy behind the US, on course for a rise of 1.8%. Tariffs and trade uncertainty are expected to drag US growth compared with last year’s 2.4% GDP expansion. “These numbers show that the UK economy is fundamentally strong and a great place to do business — we are growing faster than any other G7 economy this year,” Chancellor Reeves said. “But I know that there is so much more we can do to build an economy in this country that works for working people, and rewards hard work,” she continued. UK growth is set to slow to 1% in 2026, reflecting tighter fiscal policy, increased trade costs, and continued uncertainty. According to the OECD , all developing countries had to restore public finances through additional tax revenues and expenditure restraint. According to the report, fiscal discipline will be necessary to protect long–term debt sustainability and preserve room to react to future shocks. Additionally, stronger efforts to contain and reallocate spending and higher revenues are essential to stabilize debt burdens. The OECD said the forecast is its first since the Trump administration established a US average tariff rate of 17–19% in July, representing a century-high level of trade protectionism. The report concluded that the full effects of the increased tariffs on imports have yet to be felt. Get seen where it counts.

Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, has just dropped exciting news that could significantly expand your trading horizons. They are officially adding HEMI margin pairs to their robust platform, offering both cross and isolated margin trading options. This pivotal update goes live at 12:00 p.m. UTC on September 23, marking a fresh opportunity for enthusiasts looking to diversify their strategies. What Does Adding HEMI Margin Pairs Mean for Traders? Binance’s decision to introduce HEMI/USDT and HEMI/USDC as new HEMI margin pairs opens up a new avenue for leveraging market movements. Margin trading essentially allows you to borrow funds to increase your trading position beyond what your existing capital would normally permit. This can amplify potential profits, but it is important to remember that it also magnifies potential losses. HEMI/USDT Pair: This allows traders to use Tether (USDT), a popular stablecoin, as collateral for margin trading HEMI. HEMI/USDC Pair: Similarly, traders can utilize USD Coin (USDC), another widely adopted stablecoin, for their HEMI margin positions. The availability of both cross and isolated margin options provides flexibility. Cross margin uses your entire margin balance across all positions to prevent liquidation, while isolated margin restricts the margin to a single position, limiting your risk exposure for that specific trade. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for managing risk effectively when trading HEMI margin pairs . Why Are These New HEMI Margin Pairs an Exciting Development? The introduction of these new trading pairs by Binance is a significant indicator of HEMI’s growing presence and liquidity in the crypto market. For traders, this means several potential benefits: Increased Capital Efficiency: Margin trading allows you to control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital. This can lead to higher returns on your investment if your trades are successful. Enhanced Trading Strategies: With HEMI margin pairs , traders can implement more sophisticated strategies, including short-selling. If you believe the price of HEMI might drop, you can borrow and sell it, then buy it back at a lower price, profiting from the decline. Improved Liquidity: The addition of margin pairs often brings more trading activity and deeper liquidity to the asset, potentially leading to tighter spreads and better execution prices. Market Exposure: It provides another way for traders to gain exposure to HEMI, speculating on its price movements without needing to hold the full value of the asset. This expansion truly empowers traders with more tools and opportunities to engage with the dynamic crypto market, specifically around the HEMI token. What Are the Risks and How Can You Navigate HEMI Margin Pairs Safely? While the potential for amplified profits is attractive, it is vital to approach margin trading with caution. The magnified gains also come with magnified losses. A sudden market downturn can quickly liquidate your position if you are not careful. Liquidation Risk: If the market moves significantly against your position, your collateral may be insufficient to cover the losses, leading to automatic liquidation by the exchange. Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including HEMI, are known for their high volatility. This inherent characteristic makes margin trading even riskier, as prices can swing dramatically in short periods. Interest Rates: When you borrow funds for margin trading, you incur interest. These rates can eat into your profits, especially during prolonged trades. To navigate these risks when trading HEMI margin pairs , it is essential to: Start Small: Begin with a small portion of your portfolio to understand how margin trading works. Use Stop-Loss Orders: These orders automatically close your position if the price reaches a certain level, limiting potential losses. Educate Yourself: Understand the mechanics of margin trading, including leverage, margin calls, and liquidation prices. Monitor the Market: Stay informed about market news and trends that could impact HEMI’s price. Binance provides educational resources on margin trading, which can be invaluable for both new and experienced traders looking to engage with HEMI margin pairs responsibly. Getting Started: How to Access Binance’s New HEMI Margin Pairs Accessing these new trading opportunities on Binance is straightforward for existing users. If you’re new to Binance, you’ll first need to create an account and complete the necessary identity verification (KYC) procedures. Once your account is set up and verified: Enable Margin Trading: Navigate to your Binance account settings and enable margin trading. You might need to pass a short quiz to confirm your understanding of the risks involved. Transfer Funds: Transfer USDT or USDC from your spot wallet to your margin wallet. These funds will serve as your collateral. Select Your Pair: Go to the margin trading interface and select either the HEMI/USDT or HEMI/USDC pair. Choose Margin Type: Decide between cross margin and isolated margin based on your risk tolerance and strategy. Place Your Order: Enter your desired trade details, including the amount and leverage. Always review your order carefully before confirming. Remember, the effective date for these new HEMI margin pairs is 12:00 p.m. UTC on September 23. Plan your trades accordingly! A Strategic Move for Binance and HEMI Traders The addition of HEMI margin pairs by Binance is a clear signal of the exchange’s commitment to expanding its offerings and catering to the diverse needs of its global user base. For HEMI, it signifies increased utility and accessibility, potentially driving more interest and trading volume. For traders, it represents a fresh frontier of opportunities, albeit one that demands careful consideration of risk. By understanding the tools available and approaching margin trading with a well-thought-out strategy, you can potentially leverage these new pairs to your advantage.

Its surges and retreats have often dictated the direction of every other digital asset. Yet one token is quietly positioning itself for a future that doesn’t depend on Bitcoin’s moves. XRP is steadily emerging as a purpose-built tool for global finance —a role that could allow it to break free from the gravitational pull of the broader crypto market. From Speculation to Strategic Infrastructure Versan Aljarrah, co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist, highlights that XRP was never intended to mimic Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative. This asset was designed as a bridge for institutions, enabling real-time cross-border liquidity and settlement. In today’s financial landscape, cross-border payments are often slow, costly, and vulnerable to foreign-exchange risk. A neutral bridge currency like XRP can eliminate the need for multiple intermediaries, making it easier for banks and payment providers to settle obligations within seconds while reducing operational costs and risk exposure. This utility moves XRP far beyond speculative trading. It positions the token as an integral piece of global financial plumbing, where value flows seamlessly between different currencies and jurisdictions. Because XRP is designed as a bridge asset for institutions, its trajectory won’t always mirror Bitcoin’s. Over time, it will decouple. XRP will carve its own path, driven by adoption, regulation, and integration into global finance. pic.twitter.com/IM47dVgFAx — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) September 23, 2025 Regulatory Clarity and Growing Adoption Legal uncertainty has long been the biggest challenge to institutional adoption of XRP. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs cast a shadow for years, alleging that the company conducted unregistered securities sales. That cloud has now been lifted. A series of court rulings clarified that XRP sales on public exchanges are not securities transactions, and withdrawal of appeals by both parties brought about the much-needed closure. This clarity has opened doors. Financial institutions, fintechs, and payment networks that were once cautious are now exploring how XRP can underpin their cross-border operations. Meanwhile, the XRP Ledger continues to evolve, adding automated market making, stablecoin support, and new token standards to meet the compliance and efficiency needs of major institutions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Breaking Away from Bitcoin As institutional adoption deepens, the forces driving XRP’s value will differ from those influencing Bitcoin. Rather than reacting to speculative cycles, XRP’s price could increasingly reflect real-world usage, regulatory developments, and demand for instant settlement. Ripple’s launch of the RLUSD stablecoin and its efforts to secure banking licenses worldwide further reinforce this shift, building an ecosystem where XRP functions as financial infrastructure rather than a purely speculative asset. The Road Ahead Challenges remain. Regulatory approaches vary across jurisdictions, and global liquidity infrastructure must continue to expand. Yet if XRP delivers on its promise of speed, compliance, and cost efficiency, it can truly chart an independent course. Aljarrah’s insight underscores a pivotal point: XRP’s future will not be defined by Bitcoin’s fortunes. Instead, its success will hinge on becoming the indispensable bridge that links the world’s financial systems.

Galeon’s Electronic Health Records will connect the devices securely, allowing on-chain Web3 features. Samsung will partner with Galeon to add decentralized records from its leading ultrasound devices. The technical leader will use its new AI-powered ultrasound devices and produce data for Galeon’s Electronic Health Record (EHR). Galeon already has a live in-production platform launched across 18 interconnected hospitals in Europe. Samsung has already trained its AI to assist in women’s health diagnostics, adding AI-enhanced recognition of congenital conditions. “ We are incredibly proud of this partnership and ready to disrupt the health market together,” said Benjamin Tarter, Head of Women’s Health at Samsung France. Galeon will coordinate the direct integration of device data to the EHR, creating smoother clinical workflows. Galeon’s software and data infrastructure means clinicians can update and interpret ultrasound images in real-time, while retaining full patient privacy. The goal is to use Web3 principles to decrease the administrative load of hospitals, while allowing for better diagnostics and care decisions. Galeon will handle clinical flows and bring quality AI training Galeon enables hospitals to train AI models on the incoming datasets, which are kept fully anonymous. Each institution will be able to control its data while still gaining access to transparent model training with real-world information. As Samsung’s devices are connected, Galeon will be able to provide better and more accurate AI training, creating immediate, structured, standards-based records. The data and interpretation can turn into immediate tools for preventative medicine at scale. “ Samsung’s device leadership meets our in-production EHR and decentralized AI stack to provide what the industry has been missing. Starting in women’s health, we are connecting AI imaging, real-time hospital workflows, and community-governed research to accelerate discoveries while protecting privacy,” said Dr Loïc Brotons , CEO at Galeon. Galeon’s Atlantis platform will handle the gathered research data, which will also use the native GALEON token. A total of over 100K supporters can carry the anonymized data through Galeon DAO, voting to fund medical studies. The partnership also expands the Web3 trend of DeSci, with real-world data and direct link to patient needs. Decentralized science revives in 2025 The Atlantis platform aims to simplify participation and decentralized science governance. The project mixes data from over 10,000 caregivers with thousands of monthly users and investors. Galeon thus manages to tokenize and tap the value of real-time clinical practice and research. Samsung and Galeon are reviving the decentralized science (DeSci) narrative in 2025. The entire sector brings multiple tokens, valued close to $1B. The principle of DeSci is to tokenize real scientific data and incentivize research through investor participation and voting.

52145918,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=208179,1758629780,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/52145918.jpeg,"At $0.16, Could This Altcoin Surge Toward $1 Next on BitMart?",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/at-0-16-could-this-altcoin-surge-toward-1-next-on-bitmart/,"BitcoinWorld At $0.16, Could This Altcoin Surge Toward $1 Next on BitMart? BitMart has just confirmed the listing of RCO Finance , and traders are already calling it one of the biggest opportunities of 2025. With the token still trading at a low entry point, many believe this could be the spark that sends prices soaring. This listing is shaping up as a pivotal moment for investors looking to catch the next big run. Why $0.16 is Catching the Eye of Traders? At just $0.13, traders are beginning to recognize the gap between where RCOF is now and where it could be once its BitMart listing goes live on September 19. https://x.com/BitMartExchange/status/1958469135295238490 The numbers speak for themselves. The project has already raised more than $36 million in its presale , with four major Big Tech venture capital firms on board, including backing from a ChatGPT founder. That type of institutional participation signals confidence, credibility, and a longer-term runway for growth. The platform also boasts over 315,000 registered users, 122,000 daily active ones, and over $152 million in trading volume. In fact, the token has already seen steady appreciation. Starting at $0.01275, it has climbed to $0.16 during presale. That’s more than a 1,100% increase before the BitMart debut. So $0.16 feels like a last-chance entry before the project transitions into open market trading, where demand could accelerate sharply. What Could a BitMart Listing Mean for Growth? A confirmed BitMart listing marks the transition from presale to a liquid, global marketplace. This is the moment where the early community and raised capital meet broader liquidity, and historically, that’s when projects experience their sharpest moves. BitMart also has a track record of putting early-stage Web3 tokens in front of millions of retail traders, and its listings often trigger liquidity surges within days. Accessibility is a big part of that story. Anyone with a BitMart account will be able to trade RCOF . With BitMart’s credibility and history of accelerating growth for innovative projects, RCOF has a real chance of replicating that cycle. And if early-stage adoption is anything to go by, the foundation is already there. The Fundamentals Powering This Altcoin’s Rise What sets RCO Finance apart from other tokens lining up for exchange listings is its technology. At its core is the AI-powered Robo Advisor , a trading tool that pulls real-time data from platforms like Bloomberg and Reuters to give users entry and exit points tailored to their unique profiles. Unlike typical financial advisors, the AI learns and adapts to each user’s goals, risk tolerance, and financial horizon. That means your investment plan doesn’t look like anyone else’s; it looks like yours. The Robo Advisor also removes the emotional bias that often derails traders, making decisions purely on data. It works in real time, flagging downturns before they spiral and adjusting portfolios automatically. And the innovation doesn’t stop there. Investors can diversify across more than 120,000 options, from stocks, ETFs, and bonds to tokenized assets like real estate, all without KYC. Wallet management and debit card features make it easy to spend crypto holdings directly, cutting out frustrating conversions. The RCOF token itself unlocks benefits for holders within the ecosystem, from reduced fees to enhanced portfolio tools. Overall, RCO Finance is positioning itself as the only crypto-native AI tool in the sector, solving the real problem of human error and making professional-grade investing accessible to anyone. The Path From $0.13 Toward the One Dollar Mark With a projected listing price between $0.65 and $0.85, the upside from today’s $0.16 entry is obvious. A $1,000 investment at this stage could be worth more than $5,000 by the time the listing goes live, and if the token follows the adoption curve many expect, that figure could climb far higher. The momentum is already baked in. Each presale stage has seen gains, and the project’s growth trajectory mirrors early patterns from other Web3 launches that went on to deliver 10x to 20x returns. For context, RCOF’s presale has already grown more than 1,100%, and the next wave of adoption could easily carry it to new highs, up to $1. And backing all of this is the reassurance of security. A full audit by SolidProof revealed no vulnerabilities, confirming that the platform is safe. At $0.16, RCO Finance is still low-priced. However, with BitMart opening the door to a worldwide retail audience, the path to $1 is very possible. For investors waiting, this might be the final call before prices begin their climb.

According to Whale Alert, a well-known blockchain transaction tracker, an astonishing 1,218 BTC, valued at approximately $137 million, was moved from Ceffu, an institutional custody platform, directly to Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. This event, occurring just minutes ago, raises important questions about institutional activity and market dynamics. What Exactly Happened with This Massive Bitcoin Transfer? The core of this news revolves around a single, large transaction. Whale Alert, a service that monitors and reports significant blockchain movements, flagged the Bitcoin transfer from Ceffu to Binance. This isn’t just any ordinary transaction; it represents a substantial shift of capital within the crypto ecosystem, moving from a specialized institutional storage provider to a high-volume trading platform. Ceffu’s Role: Ceffu operates as an institutional-grade custody solution, meaning it provides secure storage for large amounts of digital assets for institutional clients like hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations. Binance’s Role: Binance, on the other hand, is a leading cryptocurrency exchange, known for its vast trading volumes and extensive range of digital assets. It serves both retail and institutional traders globally. The sheer volume of this Bitcoin transfer , totaling $137 million, immediately signals that this is not a retail investor’s move. Instead, it points to a strategic decision made by a large entity. Why Do Large Bitcoin Transfers Matter for the Market? When such a considerable amount of Bitcoin changes hands, especially between key institutional players, it sends ripples through the market. These movements are often seen as indicators of broader trends or strategic intentions. Therefore, understanding the potential implications of this Bitcoin transfer is crucial for anyone following the crypto space. Such large transfers can: Influence Market Sentiment: Big moves from institutional custodians to exchanges can sometimes suggest an intention to sell, which might create downward pressure on prices. Conversely, transfers from exchanges to cold storage could signal long-term holding intentions. Impact Liquidity: Moving a large sum of BTC to an exchange increases the available supply for trading, potentially enhancing market liquidity. This can be beneficial for large trades, allowing them to be executed with less price impact. Signal Institutional Confidence: The fact that institutions are actively managing and moving significant crypto holdings, even between their own custody solutions and exchanges, highlights their continued engagement and growing presence in the digital asset space. Unpacking the Potential Reasons Behind the Transfer While the exact motive behind this specific Bitcoin transfer remains speculative, several common reasons could explain such a substantial movement of funds. Institutional players engage in these transfers for various strategic purposes, each with different market implications. Portfolio Rebalancing: An institution might be rebalancing its portfolio, moving assets to facilitate trades or adjust its exposure to different cryptocurrencies. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large transactions are often executed through OTC desks to avoid impacting market prices on public exchanges. The transfer to Binance could be a preparatory step for an OTC sale or purchase. Increased Trading Demand: The institution might anticipate increased trading activity or need to fulfill existing client orders, requiring a larger pool of Bitcoin on an active exchange. Security Consolidation: Sometimes, these transfers are part of internal security protocols, moving funds between different wallets or custody solutions for enhanced protection or operational efficiency. Each of these possibilities paints a different picture of the market’s current state and the institution’s strategic outlook. What Are the Broader Implications for the Crypto Market? This Bitcoin transfer serves as a reminder of the dynamic and evolving nature of the cryptocurrency market. The growing involvement of institutional players like Ceffu and their active management of significant digital asset portfolios underscores a maturing industry. The transparency offered by blockchain technology, allowing services like Whale Alert to track these movements, provides valuable insights into these large-scale activities. As the crypto landscape continues to develop, these institutional flows will likely play an even more prominent role in shaping market trends and investor confidence. Monitoring such transfers can offer a glimpse into the strategic decisions of major players, helping to anticipate potential market shifts. In conclusion, the $137 million Bitcoin transfer from Ceffu to Binance is more than just a large transaction; it’s a significant indicator of ongoing institutional engagement in the crypto market. While the precise reasons behind this move are not publicly disclosed, it highlights the increasing sophistication and strategic depth of major players in the digital asset space. These movements contribute to the market’s liquidity and can offer valuable clues about future price action and investor sentiment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Ceffu? Ceffu is an institutional-grade custody platform that provides secure storage and asset management solutions for large institutional clients holding digital assets like Bitcoin. Why is a $137 million Bitcoin transfer significant? A transfer of this magnitude is significant because it typically indicates institutional activity rather than retail. It can influence market sentiment, impact liquidity on exchanges, and signal strategic moves by major players. How does Whale Alert track these transactions? Whale Alert monitors public blockchain ledgers for large transactions. Since all Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, Whale Alert can identify and report these significant movements in real-time. Could this transfer affect Bitcoin’s price? Potentially. If the transfer is a precursor to a large sale, it could exert downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price due to increased supply on the exchange. Conversely, if it’s for an OTC purchase or internal rebalancing, the impact might be minimal or even positive. What does this mean for institutional adoption of crypto? Such large and active transfers demonstrate continued and growing institutional engagement in the cryptocurrency market. It suggests that institutions are not just holding assets but actively managing and deploying them, indicating increasing confidence and integration into traditional finance.

52146275,https://finbold.com/?p=253880,1758630401,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,This Robert Kiyosaki–inspired portfolio is up nearly 40% in 2025,https://finbold.com/this-robert-kiyosaki-inspired-portfolio-is-up-nearly-40-in-2025/,"The prominent investor Robert Kiyosaki is widely known for three things: authoring the best-selling personal finance book Rich Dad Poor Dad , making exceptionally provocative posts on X , and being relentlessly bullish on gold , silver , and Bitcoin ( BTC ), while remaining mightily bearish on the U.S. dollar . This year, his long-standing calls on “real money” have been vindicated. Gold is trading at fresh all-time highs, silver has mounted an impressive rally, and Bitcoin has reclaimed record levels after a volatile start to the decade. To assess just how well Kiyosaki’s favorite assets performed in 2025, Finbold Research simulated a $1,000 portfolio split evenly across gold, silver, and Bitcoin on January 1, 2025. Each asset received an initial allocation of $333.33. By September 23, 2025, the portfolio had risen to $1,372.43, reflecting a 37.24% year-to-date gain. Gold advanced from $2,658 to $3,754 per ounce, a 43.06% increase. Silver jumped from $29.57 to $43.89 per ounce, representing a 47.5% surge. Bitcoin moved from $94,388 to $113,080, delivering a 21.17% gain. Silver was the standout performer, but all three assets contributed meaningfully to the portfolio’s strength. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); ‘Rich Dad’s’ investment advice Kiyosaki’s enthusiasm for precious metals dates back decades. He frequently referenced his investments in gold and silver as early as the late 1990s. His first public acknowledgment of Bitcoin came on August 14, 2017, when he cautiously recommended it on Facebook. At the time, he warned it was extremely risky and expressed doubts about its long-term prospects, but still suggested it had merit as a hedge. On that day, Bitcoin stood near $4,300, gold at $1,281, and silver at $17. A $1,000 investment split across the three would today be worth over $14,500, underscoring the powerful compounding of his thesis on hard assets. By September 23, 2021, his rhetoric grew sharper as he warned , “Get gold, silver, Bitcoin, Ethereum before the biggest crash in history,” when Ethereum was worth $3,411. Those who followed the call are comfortably in profit today. On March 29, 2022, he widened his basket further, tweeting , “Buy more gold, silver, Bitcoin, Ethereum, & Solana before WW3,” at the time Solana was trading at $106.33, since then it has since more than doubled to $218. Whether or not one agrees with Kiyosaki’s often apocalyptic tone, his favored hedge assets have delivered strong results in 2025. Precious metals surged amid monetary policy uncertainty, while Bitcoin pushed higher on the back of institutional inflows. In the year to date, his “core three”, gold, silver, and Bitcoinnhave comfortably outperformed most traditional investments, lending further weight to his repeated mantra: distrust fiat, trust scarcity.

The tech giant has just unveiled a groundbreaking overhaul of its Google Play Store , integrating sophisticated AI capabilities and a host of new features designed to make app discovery and engagement more intuitive and personal than ever before. For those who track the cutting edge of technology, these updates signal a significant leap in how we interact with our mobile ecosystems, mirroring the dynamic shifts seen across the broader digital landscape. This isn’t just a facelift; it’s a fundamental reimagining of the digital storefront, poised to redefine how billions of users discover and interact with content. Unlocking Unprecedented Personalization in the Google Play Store At the heart of Google’s latest transformation for the Google Play Store is a deep commitment to personalization. Recognizing that every user has unique needs and interests, Google has introduced features that intelligently tailor the store experience. This shift aims to move beyond generic recommendations, offering content that truly resonates with individual preferences. One of the most significant additions is the new You tab , designed to serve as a personal hub for every user. Imagine a centralized dashboard where all your digital life on Google Play converges. This tab provides a streamlined view of your subscriptions, making it easy to manage ongoing services without navigating through multiple menus. Furthermore, it aggregates your rewards, such as Play Points, ensuring you don’t miss out on benefits. But the true power of the You tab lies in its ability to offer highly relevant recommendations. Whether you’re interested in the latest blockbuster movies, captivating TV shows, insightful podcasts, or a new e-book, the You tab intelligently suggests content based on your past interactions and expressed interests. It also conveniently allows you to pick up exactly where you left off in your reading, listening, or watching, creating a seamless and interruption-free experience. Beyond the You tab, the redesigned Apps tab also contributes significantly to this personalized journey. Google is introducing new “curated spaces” within this tab, which are dynamic sections dedicated to seasonal events or highly specific user interests. For instance, in the U.S., users might find a curated space dedicated to the WNBA, offering relevant apps, news, and content. This concept has already seen success in regions like India and Japan, where curated spaces focused on regional interests like cricket and comics have significantly boosted engagement. Korean users will soon benefit from a dedicated video content space, offering a rich mix of movies, TV shows, and short-form video, acknowledging the surging popularity of short-form media consumption on smartphones. These spaces are not just about showing popular content; they’re about anticipating and serving diverse cultural and individual interests, making the app discovery process feel less like searching and more like being presented with exactly what you need. The goal is clear: transform the Play Store from a vast, sometimes overwhelming catalog into a bespoke digital assistant that understands and caters to your unique digital lifestyle. This focus on individual preferences marks a crucial step in enhancing user satisfaction and fostering deeper engagement with the platform. How Cutting-Edge AI Features are Transforming Discovery and Engagement The core of Google’s Play Store evolution lies in its integration of sophisticated AI features , which are fundamentally changing how users discover content and interact with the platform. These intelligent additions are designed to make the experience more intuitive, efficient, and ultimately, more engaging. One of the standout innovations is Guided Search . This feature moves beyond traditional keyword-based searches, allowing users to express their needs or goals in natural language. Instead of trying to recall a specific app name, you can simply type in a desired outcome. For example, a user looking for a new home could type “find a home,” and Guided Search would intelligently point them towards relevant real estate applications. This is a significant leap forward, democratizing app discovery by making it accessible to users who may not know specific app titles but have clear objectives. It removes a common barrier to entry, ensuring that valuable applications are found by those who need them most. The redesigned Apps tab , as mentioned earlier, also heavily leverages AI to power its “curated spaces.” These spaces are not static; they dynamically pull in content from multiple applications, creating rich, themed experiences. For instance, a “seasonal events” space might aggregate content related to an upcoming holiday, including shopping apps, recipe apps, and entertainment options, all presented in a cohesive manner. This AI-driven curation ensures that the content presented is not only relevant but also timely, reflecting current trends and user activities. By intelligently grouping diverse content around a central theme, Google is making the Apps tab a more vibrant and useful destination, encouraging users to explore beyond their usual downloads. Furthermore, these AI features extend to how the Play Store understands and responds to user behavior over time. The system learns from your interactions, your downloads, your viewing habits, and your expressed interests to continually refine its recommendations. This continuous learning loop ensures that the personalization aspects of the Play Store become more accurate and valuable with every interaction. It’s about creating a living, breathing digital marketplace that adapts to you, rather than you adapting to it. This intelligent approach to content delivery fosters a deeper connection between users and the vast array of digital offerings available on the platform, significantly boosting engagement. The Power of Play Store AI: Gemini’s Impact on Gaming and Personalization The integration of Google’s advanced Gemini AI integration marks a pivotal moment for the Play Store AI , particularly in revolutionizing the gaming experience and personalizing user interactions. Gemini, Google’s most capable AI model, is now directly empowering several groundbreaking features, making the Play Store a smarter and more interactive platform. Perhaps the most exciting application of Gemini is within the new Play Games Sidekick . This innovative in-game overlay provides real-time gaming assistance directly from Gemini Live. Imagine being stuck on a particularly challenging level in your favorite game. Instead of pausing, exiting the game, and searching for tutorials online, you can simply activate the Sidekick. You can ask Gemini for guidance, tips, or strategies, and it will provide quick, context-aware responses and even encouragement. This feature leverages Gemini’s audio-to-audio model, allowing for natural language interaction and a seamless gaming flow. It’s like having an expert companion right there with you, enhancing the immersion and reducing frustration. Initially, the Sidekick will support popular titles from EA and Netmarble, including Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes , FC Mobile , and Solo Leveling: Arise , with more integrations expected in the future. This represents a significant evolution in how AI can enhance interactive entertainment, transforming how players approach challenges and learn within games. Beyond in-game assistance, Gemini AI integration also brings a touch of personalization to user profiles. Gamers can now customize their new gamer profile within the You tab with a unique Gen AI avatar . This feature allows users to express their individuality through AI-generated images, adding a fun and creative dimension to their digital identity on the platform. It’s a subtle yet powerful way to leverage generative AI, making the user experience more engaging and personal from the moment they log in. The broader impact of Play Store AI , fueled by Gemini, extends to the intelligence behind recommendations and content curation. Gemini’s advanced understanding of context and user intent means that the suggestions you receive for apps, games, movies, and books are not just based on simple algorithms but on a deeper comprehension of your preferences and needs. This makes the entire discovery process more relevant and enjoyable, reducing the noise and highlighting content that genuinely aligns with your interests. The strategic deployment of Gemini AI underscores Google’s vision for a truly intelligent and user-centric digital storefront, where AI acts as a personal guide rather than just a search engine. Elevating the Gaming Experience with Intelligent Updates For the vast community of mobile gamers, Google’s latest updates to the Play Store are nothing short of revolutionary, promising an enriched and more connected gaming experience . These enhancements centralize crucial gaming elements and introduce innovative AI-powered assistance, making the Play Store a definitive hub for all things gaming. The new Games tab is at the forefront of this transformation. This dedicated space now consolidates everything a gamer needs: stat and achievement tracking across various titles and devices, rewards management (like Play Points), and community features. This centralization eliminates the need to jump between different apps or websites to monitor progress, fostering a more cohesive and immersive gaming journey. Imagine seeing all your hard-earned achievements from multiple games displayed in one elegant dashboard – it’s a dream come true for dedicated players. Adding a competitive edge, Play Games Leagues are being introduced, allowing users to challenge friends and compete for Play Points rewards. This feature kicks off with a league dedicated to the hugely popular title Subway Surfers , running from October 10th to October 23rd. These leagues not only encourage social interaction but also provide tangible incentives for engagement, turning casual gaming into a more dynamic and rewarding activity. It taps into the innate human desire for competition and recognition, making the gaming experience more vibrant. As previously highlighted, the AI-enabled Play Games Sidekick , powered by Gemini Live, is a game-changer. This in-game overlay provides real-time assistance, offering tips and guidance when players encounter difficulties. This feature builds on Google DeepMind’s work in developing AI agents for various domains, including gaming, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of in-game context. Aurash Mahbood, VP and General Manager of Google Play Games, emphasized that this innovation means “instead of having to leave the game to seek out tutorials or walkthroughs, we’re leveraging the latest Gemini audio-to-audio model to help understand your gaming context, providing you quick responses and encouragement.” The Sidekick also curates and organizes other relevant gaming information, ensuring players can stay immersed in their game world without interruptions. This intelligent companion promises to democratize challenging games, making them more accessible and enjoyable for a wider audience. Further enhancing the discovery and engagement within the gaming ecosystem are the enhanced Game Detail Pages . These pages will now showcase comprehensive information about each title, including ongoing in-game events, developer updates, and special offers. A particularly exciting upcoming feature is the ability for gamers to ask questions and share answers directly on these pages, fostering a community-driven support system. This peer-to-peer interaction will allow players to provide or receive help from fellow enthusiasts, creating a more collaborative and supportive environment. Finally, Google Play Games on PC, which brings over 200,000 Android titles to Windows desktops, is officially exiting beta. This move significantly expands the reach of the Android gaming library, offering a seamless cross-device gaming experience and further blurring the lines between mobile and desktop gaming. These collective updates underscore Google’s strategic investment in making the Play Store the ultimate destination for gamers, offering unparalleled features and intelligent assistance. Benefits and Considerations of the New Play Store These comprehensive updates to the Google Play Store bring a multitude of benefits for both users and developers. For users, the primary advantage is a significantly enhanced and personalized experience. The new You tab and AI-driven curated spaces mean less time searching and more time enjoying content that truly aligns with their interests. Guided Search simplifies discovery, making the vast catalog of apps and games more approachable. The Play Games Sidekick revolutionizes in-game assistance, fostering a more enjoyable and less frustrating gaming journey. Overall, users can expect a more intuitive, efficient, and engaging interaction with their digital content. For developers, these changes offer increased visibility and engagement opportunities. Personalized recommendations mean their apps and games are more likely to reach the right audience. Curated spaces provide new avenues for showcasing content, especially during seasonal events or within niche interest areas. The enhanced Game Detail Pages and community features can boost app discovery, foster stronger communities around their titles, and potentially drive higher conversion rates and sustained engagement. By making the Play Store a more dynamic and user-friendly platform, Google is creating a richer ecosystem that benefits the entire app and gaming community. While the new features promise a more engaging experience, there are always considerations with such extensive updates. The heavy reliance on AI for personalization raises questions about data privacy and how user data is utilized to power these intelligent recommendations. Google will need to ensure transparency and robust privacy controls to maintain user trust. Additionally, with so many new features and a redesigned interface, there might be a learning curve for some users, particularly those less tech-savvy. Ensuring clear onboarding and intuitive navigation will be crucial for widespread adoption and satisfaction. Developers will also need to adapt their strategies to leverage the new discovery mechanisms and community features effectively, potentially requiring new approaches to marketing and user engagement within the Play Store ecosystem. The Future is Here: A Smarter, More Personal Digital Hub Google’s ambitious revamp of its Play Store marks a significant evolution in how digital content is discovered, consumed, and experienced. By deeply integrating AI features , particularly through Gemini AI integration , and prioritizing personalization, Google is transforming its platform into an intelligent, adaptive hub tailored to individual users. From the intuitive Guided Search and dynamic curated spaces to the revolutionary Play Games Sidekick and enhanced gaming experience , every update is geared towards increasing engagement and making the digital journey more seamless and enjoyable. This strategic investment in artificial intelligence and user-centric design solidifies the Google Play Store ‘s position as a leading destination for apps, games, and entertainment, promising a future where digital interaction is not just functional, but truly intelligent and personalized.

This capital will be used to expand CleanSpark's energy portfolio, scale mining operations, and invest in high-performance computing (HPC) capabilities. The funds support CleanSpark's ”Infrastructure First” strategy, focusing on sustainable energy solutions and efficient mining operations. The company plans to deploy this capital into accretive assets across its portfolio, enhancing shareholder value and positioning itself for long-term growth. As of September 2025, CleanSpark holds 12,703 BTC, making it one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin globally. This represents a significant increase from early 2025 and underscores the company's strong growth trajectory. In early January 2025, the company reported an increase in Bitcoin reserves to 10,097 BTC, an increase of 236% compared with the previous year. In February, the company added another 624 BTC, raising its balance to 11,177 BTC and reaching 40.7 EH/s of operational hashrate. Coinbase Prime praised CleanSpark for its innovative approach to capital strategy. Brett Tejpaul, Head of Coinbase Institutional, said, ”We see this move as an important milestone in the development of the crypto ecosystem through targeted capital allocation.” CleanSpark’s Chief Executive Matt Schultz stated, ”We're proud to expand our partnership with Coinbase Prime as we continue adding megawatts to our portfolio and exploring alternative uses for our data centers.” Looking ahead, CleanSpark is positioned to continue its growth trajectory, leveraging the $100 million credit line to enhance mining operations and energy infrastructure.

After Monday’s $1.8 billion crypto liquidation shook investor confidence, traders are bracing for fresh signals on the Federal Reserve’s policy stance that could ripple across risk assets. For Bitcoin, analysts remain sharply divided on whether the world’s largest cryptocurrency is headed for a retracement toward $107K or preparing for a breakout that could send it beyond $130K, with macro uncertainty amplifying every move. Upcoming Fed Data Signal Caution on Rate Cuts Monday’s hawkish tone emerged when St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem voiced concerns about further rate cuts beyond September’s 25 basis point reduction , citing inflation above the Fed’s 2% target despite a softening labor market. Atlanta Fed President Bostic reinforced this caution, projecting only one rate cut for 2025 with core inflation at 3.1% and unemployment rising to 4.5% by year-end. BREAKING: FED PRESIDENT BOSTIC JUST SAID THERE'S NO REASON FOR FURTHER RATE CUTS THIS YEAR! pic.twitter.com/0oiUJHKxBi — Coinvo (@ByCoinvo) September 22, 2025 Markets reacted swiftly, with a stronger dollar, rising Treasury yields, and reduced expectations for a November rate cut. Bitcoin tumbled to $111,800, erasing weekly gains as $1.8 billion in crypto liquidations dragged the total market cap down to $3.89 trillion. Shawn Young, Chief Analyst at MEXC Research, told Cryptonews that macro catalysts are driving BTC between $107K downside risk and a potential $135K recovery. Over 407,000 traders were liquidated as Bitcoin fell below $112,000 and Ether dropped under $4,150, marking the largest flush-out of 2025. Source: Coinglass Crypto equities also declined, with treasury firms like MicroStrategy (MSTR), Metaplanet, and Bitmine falling despite announcing new digital asset purchases. “ This reflects investor skepticism in portfolio expansion until there’s clarity on market direction and macro influence ,” Young added. Analyst Sees Inflection Point as Catalyst for Bitcoin $107K Support or $130K Breakout The MEXC analyst sees Bitcoin at a crucial inflection point as cycle exhaustion signals emerge. His analysis shows sustained closes below $112,000 risk pulling BTC toward $107,000 support, a level bulls must defend to prevent deeper retracement to the critical $100,000 mark. “ Recent liquidations may cause short-term pain, but they’re often healthy rebalancing, especially at this scale. Many participants view this pullback as an accumulation opportunity rather than capitulation ,” Young noted. He projects a sustained break above $117,000 will signal bull control, opening price discovery toward $130,000-$135,000 before the current cycle ends. Source: X/@Tradermayne Similarly, macroeconomic insights shared with Cryptonews from Greg Magadini, Director of Derivatives at Amberdata, focus on the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. Magadini believes the Fed is more worried about jobs, but overall will continue to monitor both inflation and unemployment. He added that Powell himself showed considerable uncertainty around the current environment. “ I continue to believe the biggest driver of asset prices, especially Gold and Bitcoin, revolves around the Fed’s independence ,” he said. This independence remains in question, especially as we enter 2026, when a new Fed Chairman will take over. “ Gold and Bitcoin remain in a strong appreciation trend, and I don’t think anything today changes that. “ Moreover, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has also warned that persistent inflation may prevent further Fed rate cuts, contradicting market expectations for aggressive monetary easing through 2025. Technical Analysis: Bitcoin Tests Trendline Resistance at $115K-$116K Looking at the Bitcoin/USDT 4-hour chart, BTC is currently trading around $113,009 and appears to be testing a major descending trendline that has acted as dynamic resistance since the previous highs. There’s a clear resistance zone around the $120,000-$123,000 level. The chart shows Bitcoin attempting to break above this long-term bearish trendline, with recent price action forming what appears to be a bullish flag or pennant pattern after the previous rally. The ascending trendline from the lows provides support underneath, creating a converging triangle formation that typically precedes significant directional moves. Based on these technical indicators, Bitcoin appears poised for an upward breakout attempt. If the price can get past the descending trendline and clear the $115,000-$116,000 area with volume, it would likely target the resistance zone around $120,000-$123,000. A successful break above that level could open the path toward new all-time highs above $130,000. However, failure to break the descending trendline could result in a retest of lower support levels around $107,000-$108,000, aligning with the previous consolidation zone.

That is the warning from Bain & Co., which says the revenue hole may be far wider than many assumed earlier. In its annual Global Technology Report, Bain estimates that by 2030, AI providers will need about $2 trillion in combined yearly revenue to support the computing power required to meet demand. The firm says actual revenue is expected to decline far short of that target by roughly $800 billion as efforts to generate revenue trail the pace of investment in data-center capacity and related infrastructure. The forecast raises fresh doubts about valuations and business models across the sector. Interest in products like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT , along with AI pushes by companies worldwide, is sending the need for computing capacity and electricity sharply higher. However, the savings and new income that AI can deliver are not growing as quickly as the costs, Bain says. “If the current scaling laws hold, AI will increasingly strain supply chains globally,” said the chairman of Bain’s global technology practice, David Crawford. AI spending soars as OpenAI prioritizes growth over profit OpenAI is incurring multi-billion-dollar losses each year with a focus on growth rather than profit for now, while expecting to become cash-flow positive by 2029. Bain did not assess what might happen to major AI players if profitability remains elusive as 2030 approaches. A day earlier, Nvidia and OpenAI announced a partnership to build massive data centers, as reported by Cryptopolitan . Spending plans continue to accelerate. Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta are set to push their combined annual AI outlays to more than $500 billion by the early 2030s, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. A wave of new models from OpenAI and China’s DeepSeek, among others, is fueling demand for AI services and prompting the entire industry to invest more. According to Bain, the incremental global AI computing needs could jump to 200 gigawatts by 2030, with the United States accounting for roughly half of that total. While breakthroughs in hardware and algorithms could ease the load, supply chain bottlenecks or limited power availability could still slow progress, the firm says. Alongside spending on compute, leading AI companies are pouring money into product development. One focal point is autonomous AI agents that can carry out multi-step tasks with limited guidance, in ways that mimic parts of human workflows. Over the next three to five years, Bain estimates companies will dedicate as much as 10% of overall tech budgets to building core AI capabilities, including agent platforms. Bain predicts quantum growth and early robot trials Bain anticipates growth in quantum computing, an emerging field that it says could unlock about $250 billion in market value across finance, pharmaceuticals, logistics, and materials science. Rather than a single dramatic breakthrough, the firm expects a gradual adoption curve, with early use in narrow domains over the next decade, followed by wider uptake. Humanoid robots are drawing capital and appearing more often in pilots, yet real-world deployment remains early and depends heavily on human oversight, Bain says. Commercial success will hinge on whether the surrounding ecosystem is ready hardware suppliers, software platforms, and customer operations, and companies that run pilots sooner are likely to set the pace for the field. Taken together, Bain’s findings describe a fast-rising need for computing power and energy, paired with revenue that may not keep up. The picture is one of rapid build-outs, monetization, and new technologies arriving in steps, not all at once, with early movers positioned to set direction next.

Although Solana remains a dominant institutional trade, retail players are paying growing attention to PayFi options that deliver more pragmatic adoption. A key driver behind this movement is Remittix (RTX) , a $0.1130 per token project bridging crypto and legacy finance. Solana price reaction and sentiment shift The Solana Price is around $223.99, 7.34% lower over the past 24 hours. Its market cap is $120.64 billion, with volume trading having increased 166% to $9.39 billion. This sort of volatility shows how fast liquidity can flip into early-stage crypto investments. The majority are now flocking towards the best crypto presale 2025 projects as an alternative. Among them, Remittix has also attracted attention because it provides real-world payment infrastructure rather than hype through speculation. Beta wallet live with real-world utility One of the strongest signs that Remittix is something greater than a presale is the Beta Wallet release live and accessible to users worldwide. With native support for 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies, the wallet enables direct crypto-to-bank payments in 30+ nations. Real-time FX conversion and low gas fee crypto transactions make it unique as a DeFi project catering to freelancers, remitters and businesses requiring cross-chain worldwide payments. This practical application lends merit to RTX as a crypto that has real-world utility. Unlike meme-based coins, its wallet already accommodates transactions showing how blockchain can be incorporated within conventional finance. Fundraising milestones and CEX announcements Remittix raised over $26.3 million in presale funds with over 668 million tokens sold at $0.1130 per token. The project further released two major CEX announcements that are related to its fundraising milestone. At $20 million, BitMart was publicized as the first of the centralized exchange partners. Soon after, around $22 million, LBank was also publicized as the second one. These announcements provide assurance of future liquidity and better access when trading goes live. CertiK verification, giveaway and community growth Trust plays a key role in early stage crypto investing, and Remittix has just reached a milestone by being completely verified by CertiK. More importantly, it is now the #1 ranked Pre-Launch Token on CertiK Skynet. This adds more credibility to RTX as one of the top DeFi projects 2025. Meanwhile, Remittix has launched a 15% referral program rewarding in USDT, together with an ongoing $250,000 Giveaway. How Remittix is setting the stage for 2025 adoption: $26.3 million+ raised and 668 million+ tokens sold Beta Wallet live with 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiats First CEX announcements: BitMart & LBank Ranked #1 by CertiK for Pre-Launch Tokens $250,000 Giveaway and 15% referral program While the Solana Price has been under pressure, tokens like Remittix show why the next 100x crypto is being hunted by investors outside of well-established networks.

The relocation was verified when blockchain data showed a swap of over 2,057 billion BAD which is worth about $13,759 to about 3.19 ETH worth about $13,407. The sale occurred on September 22, 2025, at 02:36 UTC, signaling the complete clearance of the attacker’s BAD stash. Mr. Lightspeed and President of Lightspeed Crypto Services, drew attention to this decisive transaction. Shortly after liquidating the BAD tokens, the exploiter moved all 3.2 ETH gained from the sale into the wallet address 0x45b…0DF2a. This address has been central to the systematic sell-off activity since the September 12 breach. Shibarium Hack: Wallet Liquidations and Asset Holdings The Shibarium Bridge hack , carried out on September 12, led to losses exceeding $4 million in stolen assets. These included SHIB, ETH, ROAR, and BAD tokens. Since the exploit, the attacker has been offloading assets in phases through MetaMask transactions, according to both on-chain data and statements from Shiba Inu developer Kaal Dhairya. On September 20, the wallet liquidated 1.01 billion SHIB for 2.90 ETH, valued at about $12,107. The following day, another 3 billion SHIB was swapped for 8.64 ETH. The exploiter also sold 1,000 LEASH tokens for 3.46 ETH, further demonstrating an ongoing liquidation strategy. At press time, the primary wallet, 0x45b…0DF2a, holds about 51.16 ETH, worth roughly $213,515, and 4,746 LEASH tokens, valued at $52,255. A second linked wallet, 0x3B7…511A8, retains around 3,630 LEASH tokens, worth nearly $40,075. Additional assets are spread across other addresses controlled by the attackers. Shiba Inu’s Response and Security Push Shiba Inu team has not been idle. In an attempt to recover funds, the developers offered a 5 ETH bounty, worth around $23,000 , with a 30-day deadline. However, the attackers declined the reward and continued selling their stolen tokens for ETH. Security firms Hexens, Seal 911, and PeckShield have joined internal developers in the investigation. Their focus is to uncover vulnerabilities, restore network stability, and secure user assets. As part of immediate containment, the Shibarium Bridge has been suspended until further notice. According to lead developer Dhairya , the project remains committed to protecting the ecosystem.

The price of Worldcoin is expected to reach a maximum level of $6.61 in 2031. Worldcoin (WLD) is garnering significant attention from both investors and enthusiasts, a trend that aligns with broader market predictions. In early May, WLD experienced a notable surge, quickly positioning itself among the top-performing altcoins. This rise coincided with a spike in activity surrounding advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly those related to OpenAI. The increased interest in Worldcoin is likely fueled by speculation surrounding potential collaborations and future projects that could integrate AI technology into the cryptocurrency space, further driving its market momentum.

Support at $1.31 is crucial; a break below it could lead to further declines. Consolidation Phase WLD is trading within a tight range between $1.31 and $1.34, signaling market indecision. On September 23, 2025, Worldcoin (WLD) is trading at $1.32, marking a slight decline of 0.3% over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has faced some selling pressure recently, with the price showing a downtrend of 1.29% on the daily chart. At this point, the price is oscillating between key support and resistance levels, with the $1.31 support zone and $1.40 resistance level playing critical roles in the immediate short-term outlook. Worldcoin 1-day price chart: WLD key support and resistance levels On the daily chart, WLD is showing a clear pattern of fluctuating between support at $1.31 and resistance at $1.40. The recent price action reveals a bearish trend after the token reached a high of $1.34 and then retraced towards its support. The price has been consistently failing to break above $1.40, which signals resistance at this level, and any attempts to breach it have been met with selling pressure. Currently, the price sits at $1.32, just above the critical support zone of $1.31. WLD/USDT Chart: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is hovering near the neutral zone, showing no clear overbought or oversold conditions. This suggests that the market is currently in a consolidation phase, with no decisive momentum in either direction. If WLD fails to hold above the $1.31 support, we could see a move towards the next lower support level, potentially around $1.20. On the other hand, a bounce from $1.31 could signal a retest of $1.40, where further upside could be expected if the resistance breaks. Worldcoin 4-hour price chart: WLD tight range and bearish bias nearing oversold conditions Zooming in on the 4-hour chart, WLD’s price has been moving within a tight range, fluctuating between the $1.31 support and the $1.34 resistance. The price action suggests a short-term bearish bias, as the recent lower highs indicate a lack of upward momentum. WLD/USDT Chart: TradingView The 4-hour RSI is nearing the oversold region, suggesting that the recent downtrend may be running out of steam. A reversal from this level could initiate a short-term rally, pushing the price back towards $1.34. However, traders should watch for a break below $1.31, as that could pave the way for further declines. Worldcoin technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.9607 BUY SMA 5 $0.942531 BUY SMA 10 $0.928258 BUY SMA 21 $0.942555 BUY SMA 50 $1.011686 BUY SMA 100 $1.012216 BUY SMA 20 $1.006532 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.902075 BUY EMA 5 $0.907784 BUY EMA 10 $0.923362 BUY EMA 21 $0.951525 BUY EMA 50 $0.989329 BUY EMA 100 $1.025326 BUY EMA 200 $1.187683 BUY ​​What can you expect from the Worldcoin price next? Based on the current price action and technical analysis, WLD is likely to remain within its established range between $1.31 and $1.34 in the short term. A potential break below the $1.31 support level could lead to further declines, possibly testing the $1.20 support zone. On the other hand, if the price holds at $1.31 and moves higher, a retest of the $1.40 resistance could be expected, but a breakout beyond this level remains uncertain due to repeated selling pressure. In the near term, the market appears to be consolidating, with no clear direction. Traders should watch for a decisive move either below $1.31 for further downside or a bounce towards the $1.40 resistance for potential upside momentum. Is Worldcoin a good investment? Worldcoin (WLD) is currently in a consolidation phase between $1.31 and $1.34, with limited upward momentum. Short-term traders might find opportunities within this range, but long-term investors should be cautious due to the lack of a clear breakout. Repeated failure to break $1.40 resistance and the potential for a breakdown below $1.31 suggest downside risk. Investors should monitor these key levels and assess their risk tolerance before making decisions. Why is the WLD Price Down today The price of Worldcoin (WLD) is down today due to ongoing selling pressure near the $1.40 resistance level, which has hindered upward movement. The cryptocurrency has struggled to break above this key resistance, leading to a slight pullback. Additionally, the price is fluctuating between critical support at $1.31 and resistance at $1.34, signaling market indecision and a lack of strong bullish momentum. These factors, combined with the overall consolidation phase, have contributed to the current downtrend of 1.29%. Will Worldcoin reach $5? Yes, according to the long-term predictions, Worldcoin is projected to reach up to $5 by 2031. Will Worldcoin reach $100? Worldcoin’s prediction shows that $100 is highly unlikely due to current market conditions, its present price levels, and the significant rise in market capitalization required. Such an increase would necessitate extraordinary growth and adoption. Does Worldcoin have a promising long-term future? WLD coin is showing some recovery trend; hence, many may consider investing in the token as it may have a promising long-term future. Continued development, adoption, and favorable market trends will be crucial for its success.

Get ready to explore the exciting potential of RLUSD conversion as Ripple and Securitize join forces to streamline the process for major institutional players. What is This Groundbreaking RLUSD Conversion All About? Imagine being able to easily transform shares from leading investment funds into a digital, blockchain-native asset. That’s precisely what’s happening. Ripple, a prominent blockchain and crypto solutions provider, along with Securitize, a leading platform for real-world asset (RWA) and security tokenization, are enabling investors to convert shares in tokenized funds from financial giants BlackRock and VanEck into RLUSD. This significant move, as reported by Cointelegraph, allows holders of BlackRock’s BUILD and VanEck’s VBILL tokenized funds to leverage a smart contract mechanism. This smart contract, developed jointly by Ripple and Securitize, facilitates a seamless RLUSD conversion , making these traditional assets more accessible and interoperable within the digital asset ecosystem. Why Does This RLUSD Conversion Matter for Investors? This initiative isn’t just a technical upgrade; it represents a powerful step towards bridging the gap between conventional finance and the burgeoning world of blockchain. For investors, the ability to perform an RLUSD conversion offers several compelling advantages: Enhanced Liquidity: Tokenized assets, by their nature, can offer greater liquidity compared to their traditional counterparts, allowing for easier buying and selling. Greater Interoperability: Converting fund shares into RLUSD means these assets can potentially be used across various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and other blockchain platforms. Reduced Friction: Smart contracts automate the conversion process, potentially reducing administrative overheads and transaction times that are common in traditional finance. Accessibility: It opens up opportunities for a broader range of investors to engage with institutional-grade funds through a more modern, digital interface. Ultimately, this move by Ripple and Securitize empowers investors with more control and flexibility over their holdings. Understanding RLUSD and Its Role in Tokenization At the heart of this innovation is RLUSD. But what exactly is it? RLUSD is a new stablecoin, representing the US dollar on the XRP Ledger. Its primary purpose is to provide a reliable and efficient medium for transactions and value transfer within the digital asset space, particularly for real-world assets. The introduction of RLUSD is a strategic move by Ripple to further expand the utility of the XRP Ledger for institutional use cases. The tokenization of real-world assets, or RWA, is a rapidly growing trend. It involves representing ownership of tangible assets like real estate, art, or even shares in a fund, as digital tokens on a blockchain. This process brings numerous benefits, including fractional ownership, increased transparency, and global accessibility. The RLUSD conversion mechanism acts as a crucial on-ramp for these tokenized assets, providing a standardized digital representation. What’s the Future for Real-World Asset Tokenization? This collaboration between Ripple, Securitize, BlackRock, and VanEck is a powerful indicator of the growing institutional interest in blockchain technology. It signals a future where traditional financial products are seamlessly integrated into the digital economy. As more financial institutions explore tokenization, we can expect: Increased adoption of stablecoins like RLUSD for settlements and transfers. A wider array of tokenized assets becoming available to investors. Further innovation in smart contract functionality to automate complex financial processes. While the benefits are clear, it’s also important to acknowledge that the regulatory landscape for tokenized assets is still evolving. Navigating these regulations will be key to widespread adoption and ensuring investor protection. A Glimpse into Tomorrow’s Finance The partnership between Ripple and Securitize to facilitate the RLUSD conversion of BlackRock and VanEck funds marks a pivotal moment. It underscores the tangible progress being made in bridging traditional finance with the efficiency and transparency of blockchain technology. This initiative is not just about converting assets; it’s about unlocking new possibilities for investors and paving the way for a more integrated, digital financial future.

Bale (@AltcoinBale), a crypto proponent, shared the screenshot and commented directly on XRP’s quest to replace the payment behemoth SWIFT. According to Bale, XRP will replace SWIFT, and investors must prepare for this massive shift. The attached document, titled “XRP Financial Impact Table,” outlines several areas where the adoption of XRP could unlock capital and reduce costs. XRP Replaces SWIFT Remember when the document below appeared on the SEC website Lock in. pic.twitter.com/JeU3kvyY4I — BALE (@AltcoinBale) September 22, 2025 Replacing SWIFT with XRP-Based Liquidity One of the most striking parts of the table is the proposal to “Replace SWIFT with XRP-based liquidity.” This suggests a future where XRP takes on the role traditionally filled by SWIFT, a network that has long been the foundation of cross-border banking. The table associates this change with freeing up $1.5 trillion in U.S. Nostro accounts. These accounts exist so banks can facilitate foreign currency transactions, and reducing the capital tied up in them would create immediate liquidity and solve a major problem for the banks . Transaction Fee Savings and Efficiency Another element highlighted is transaction fee savings, where $7.5 billion per year could be saved by shifting global payments to XRP . Moving international payment infrastructure away from existing networks and adopting blockchain-based alternatives could drastically improve cost efficiency, and this illustrates why certain sectors may explore XRP as a settlement solution. The table also outlines federal payment cost reductions, estimating $500 billion over 10 years. The proposed action is to implement XRP for IRS and Social Security payments. While no official confirmation exists that such measures are under consideration, the inclusion of these projections in a document previously linked to the SEC has fueled ongoing speculation about XRP’s potential role in U.S. government systems . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The final line of the table connects XRP adoption with “Capital for Bitcoin Reserves,” noting $1.5 trillion could be directed toward reinvestment into Bitcoin if these savings and efficiencies are realized. Continuing Conversations Around XRP’s Role Bale’s post resonated with many because it combines an official document with a claim that XRP could directly replace SWIFT . The table aligns with long-running discussions in the crypto community about the token’s potential for real-world utility, especially in payment and settlement systems. The content continues to enter the ongoing conversation about XRP’s ability to scale into global financial systems. Many experts, including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, have called SWIFT outdated , and it’s only a matter of time before XRP takes over that market.

Over the past year, tokenized U.S. Treasury funds , dollar-backed stablecoins, and enterprise-grade settlement networks have moved from theory to reality. Markets that once paused at closing bells now trade continuously, and the latest announcement from Ripple’s chief executive underscores just how quickly this transformation is accelerating. BlackRock, VanEck, and 24/7 On-Chain Liquidity Brad Garlinghouse revealed that investors in BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and VanEck’s VBILL tokenized Treasury fund can now redeem shares for Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin or Ethereum (ETH) around the clock through the regulated Securitize platform. He added that the capability to redeem directly for RLUSD on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is next in line, signaling a powerful new use case for Ripple’s technology and its growing stablecoin ecosystem. Very excited to share that @BlackRock ’s $BUIDL and @VanEck_US ’s $VBILL tokenized fund holders can redeem shares for RLUSD/ETH 24/7 365 through @Securitize , and soon to come RLUSD/XRPL. Enterprise-grade instant onchain liquidity at your fingertips. That’s real utility.… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) September 23, 2025 Why BUIDL and VBILL Matter BlackRock’s BUIDL has already attracted more than a billion dollars in assets by offering tokenized exposure to U.S. Treasuries with settlement on public blockchains. VanEck’s VBILL, launched through the same Securitize infrastructure, follows a similar model. Both funds enable qualified investors to generate traditional yields while holding blockchain tokens that can be transferred or used as collateral in real-time. RLUSD and the XRP Advantage RLUSD, Ripple’s fully reserved U.S. dollar stablecoin, operates on Ethereum and XRPL, enabling fast, low-cost settlement with full backing by dollars and short-term Treasuries. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 With RLUSD redemption integrated into major tokenized funds, investors can seamlessly switch between yield-bearing fund shares and a stablecoin on the XRP Ledger, bypassing traditional banking hours and clearing systems. This establishes a direct connection between Ripple’s network and the world’s largest asset manager for XRP holders and institutions. Confirmed Progress and the Road Ahead The live functionality—BUIDL and VBILL shares redeemable for RLUSD or ETH through Securitize—is already a reality. Garlinghouse’s statement that RLUSD/XRPL redemptions are “soon to come” highlights a rollout that is firmly underway, not a distant hope. All of the technical pieces, from Securitize’s regulated transfer agent services to RLUSD’s dual-chain design, are in place to make XRPL integration the natural next step. A Milestone for Institutional Blockchain Adoption For XRP’s global community, this development represents more than another partnership. It showcases Ripple’s role at the center of institutional finance’s shift to always-on blockchain rails. When BlackRock’s tokenized treasuries can be redeemed into a Ripple stablecoin and settled on XRPL, the promise of real-world assets moving at internet speed is no longer theoretical—it is happening now, and it places XRP’s ecosystem squarely in the path of mainstream financial innovation.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to launch a groundbreaking initiative this year: a regulatory sandbox program. This move could significantly reshape how new crypto products and services reach the market, offering a streamlined path for innovation. The introduction of the SEC crypto sandbox marks a pivotal moment for digital asset development in the United States. What Exactly is the SEC Crypto Sandbox ? A regulatory sandbox is essentially a controlled environment where businesses can test innovative products, services, or business models without immediately facing the full brunt of existing regulations. The SEC’s version is designed specifically for cryptocurrency firms. Bloomberg reported that this program aims to help these companies introduce new offerings more quickly. It’s a strategic move to foster innovation while maintaining a degree of oversight. The goal is to allow experimentation in a supervised setting, reducing the regulatory uncertainty that often hinders growth in the crypto space. This structure provides a crucial bridge between cutting-edge technology and established legal frameworks. Why is the SEC Launching This Initiative Now? SEC Chairman Paul Atkins highlighted the core philosophy behind this new program. He emphasized the need for companies to bring new technologies and products to market rapidly. However, he also stressed the importance of avoiding conflicts with existing regulations or overly burdensome requirements. The commission’s support for crypto firms launching new offerings on a stable foundation is clear. This approach recognizes the potential of crypto innovation while ensuring a responsible growth trajectory. The SEC crypto sandbox is seen as a tool to achieve this delicate balance. This initiative reflects a growing understanding within regulatory bodies that traditional frameworks may not always fit the fast-paced nature of blockchain and crypto. Therefore, a flexible approach is necessary to prevent the US from falling behind in global innovation. Major Benefits for Crypto Innovators: Unlocking Growth The introduction of the SEC crypto sandbox offers several compelling advantages for cryptocurrency firms. These benefits could significantly accelerate the pace of development and market entry for innovative projects. Faster Time to Market: Companies can test and refine products without lengthy pre-approval processes. This speeds up the launch cycle considerably. Reduced Regulatory Friction: Firms gain direct access to regulators, allowing for real-time feedback and clarification on compliance issues. Cost Efficiency: The sandbox environment can help identify potential regulatory hurdles early, saving significant legal and compliance costs down the line. Enhanced Innovation: By providing a safer space for experimentation, the sandbox encourages more daring and novel crypto solutions. Ultimately, the SEC crypto sandbox aims to cultivate an environment where groundbreaking ideas can flourish without being stifled by regulatory ambiguity. Navigating the Regulatory Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities While the prospect of an SEC crypto sandbox is exciting, its success hinges on careful implementation. There are inherent challenges in balancing innovation with essential investor protection and market integrity. One key challenge will be defining clear entry and exit criteria for the sandbox. How will the SEC select participants? What are the parameters for successful graduation from the program? Transparency in these areas will be crucial. Moreover, ensuring that the sandbox doesn’t become a loophole for non-compliant activities will be paramount. The SEC must maintain robust oversight to prevent misuse. This is an opportunity for the SEC to demonstrate its adaptability and commitment to fostering responsible innovation in the digital asset space. A Global Trend: How the US Compares The US is not alone in exploring regulatory sandboxes for fintech and crypto. Countries like the UK, Singapore, and Australia have already implemented similar programs, with varying degrees of success. These global examples offer valuable lessons. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) sandbox, for instance, has been operational for years, supporting numerous fintech firms. The insights gained from these international models can inform the design and operation of the SEC crypto sandbox , helping it avoid common pitfalls and maximize its effectiveness. This global context underscores the growing recognition among regulators worldwide that traditional approaches need updating to keep pace with technological advancements. A Bright Future for Crypto Innovation? The SEC’s plan to introduce a regulatory sandbox is a significant and positive development for the cryptocurrency industry. It signals a more pragmatic and forward-thinking approach to digital asset regulation in the US. By providing a structured pathway for new products, the SEC crypto sandbox has the potential to unlock a new wave of innovation, benefiting both firms and consumers. This initiative could help solidify the US as a leader in crypto innovation, fostering a stable yet dynamic environment for growth. The coming year will reveal the full impact of this exciting regulatory evolution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main purpose of the SEC crypto sandbox?

The initiative combines blockchain tokenization, artificial intelligence, and robotics to create a semi-autonomous vertical farming system. According to a press statement shared with Cryptopolitan, the project is a collaboration between peaq, a tokenization platform, DualMint, and urban agritech company KanayaAI. It was also unveiled during the ongoing Korean Blockchain Week held at the Grand Walkerhill Seoul. Announcing: The world’s first tokenized robo-farm is launching on peaq 🤖 Built and run by @kanaya_ai , tokenized with @DualMintRWA Expected APY: up to 20% Join the whitelist: https://t.co/K5v2ZSPQP1 pic.twitter.com/1jn9VlvLTd — peaq @KBW 2025 🇰🇷 (@peaq) September 23, 2025 The farm is located in Hong Kong and will produce lettuce, kale, spinach, and other leafy greens. Residents will be able to subscribe to home delivery services once the farm becomes operational in the fourth quarter of 2025. peaq brings automation to urban farming The Machine Economy developers mentioned that the system automates about 80% of farming tasks, including planting, monitoring, and harvesting. It uses hydroponics, robotics, and smart climate controls to maintain efficiency and consistency. KanayaAI designed, built, and operates the farm, while DualMint handles tokenization through peaq’s blockchain infrastructure. According to the developers, the facility can run around 12 crop cycles per year, much more than the three or four used in traditional agriculture. The AI-powered systems are expected to reduce labor costs by half, while producing 20% more crops than comparable farms. The farm claims to use one-tenth the water of conventional agriculture, requires no pesticides, and is said to use land ten times more efficiently, in tandem with Hong Kong’s sustainability agenda. Ownership of the farm’s revenue streams will be represented by non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on peaq, which could see token holders earn yields based on the farm’s income. A waiting list for the sale has already gone live on both DualMint’s website and the peaq portal. Developers deem tokenized robo-farms more efficient DualMint has promoted the farm as the first in a series of “Boring Robots,” machines that handle routine tasks but generate steady cash flow. “The beauty of Boring Robots is in their immunity to crypto market swings,” said Bill Lee, co-founder and CEO of DualMint. “The demand for everyday groceries has nothing to do with where crypto prices are today or tomorrow, which makes this system a healthy, sustainable foundation for growth and yields.” Lee said his company has more applications and other robotic use cases for several industries, ready to facilitate billions of dollars in economic activity on-chain. KanayaAI executives reiterated the ecological and practical benefits of vertical farms in cities. Leonard Dorlöchter, co-founder of peaq, said the project is an alternative vision for automation in an age of artificial intelligence (AI). “What we announced today is not just a breakthrough in technical or business terms, but an alternative route for humanity in the context of the Age of AI and Automation,” he surmised. The Hong Kong farm announcement comes a few months after peaq launched another initiative in conjunction with the UAE and Pulsar Group. The Machine Economy Free Zone Dubai project is a testbed for regulatory support, infrastructure, and investments for decentralized machine economy applications. These include networks for decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN).

For example, AI could automatically optimize transaction fees based on network congestion, ensuring you always get the best deal. Moreover, businesses can expect more efficient reconciliation processes and enhanced fraud prevention, leading to significant cost savings and improved operational security. This move will make cryptocurrency not just a speculative asset, but a practical, everyday payment method that feels intuitive and trustworthy. Navigating the Future: Potential Challenges for AI Payment Standards While the vision for AI payment standards is incredibly promising, the journey will undoubtedly present its own set of challenges. One major hurdle involves establishing universal adoption. Different regions and companies might have varying regulatory requirements, making it complex to create a single, unified standard that everyone accepts. Furthermore, concerns about data privacy and the ethical implications of AI in financial transactions will need careful consideration. The foundation will need to address: Regulatory Landscape: Navigating diverse global financial regulations to ensure compliance. Interoperability: Ensuring new standards work seamlessly across different blockchains and traditional payment systems. User Education: Helping users understand and trust AI-powered financial tools. Overcoming these challenges will be key to the widespread success and integration of AI in payments. The launch of the x402 Foundation by Coinbase and Cloudflare marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of digital payments. By focusing on AI payment standards , they are not just improving existing systems; they are building the framework for a more intelligent, secure, and efficient financial future.

The cryptocurrency trades with a daily volume of $51.2 billion and maintains a market cap above $2.25 trillion. While the dip has tested sentiment, Wall Street-linked firms and global treasuries are using the pullback to add aggressively to their Bitcoin holdings, signaling confidence that the next leg higher may not be far away. Treasuries Double Down Despite Weakness Several major Bitcoin treasuries announced fresh buys over the past week, undeterred by recent volatility. Strategy, led by Michael Saylor, added $99.7 million worth of Bitcoin, expanding its position even as its stock faced S&P 500 exclusion and dilution concerns. Strategy has acquired 850 BTC for ~$99.7 million at ~$117,344 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 26.0% YTD 2025. As of 9/21/2025, we hodl 639,835 $BTC acquired for ~$47.33 billion at ~$73,971 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRC $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/rG5pvryeYL — Michael Saylor (@saylor) September 22, 2025 Whereas, Japan’s Metaplanet made an even bolder move, purchasing $632 million in Bitcoin, raising its total holdings to 25,555 BTC worth roughly $3 billion. The biggest statement came from Strive, which completed a merger with Semler Scientific and immediately allocated $675 million to BTC. The combined entity will now hold over 10,900 BTC, valued at more than $1.2 billion. By paying a 210% premium on Semler’s stock, Strive also secured a profitable diagnostics business, but its primary focus remains building a formidable crypto treasury. Metaplanet has acquired 5419 BTC for ~$632.53 million at ~$116,724 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 395.1% YTD 2025. As of 9/22/2025, we hold 25,555 $BTC acquired for ~$2.71 billion at ~$106,065 per bitcoin. $MTPLF pic.twitter.com/CBhZi2X9lE — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) September 22, 2025 These moves highlight institutional conviction. Far from retreating, some of Bitcoin’s largest corporate holders are scaling their exposure, reinforcing market stability during downturns. Key institutional buys this week: Strategy: $99.7M in Bitcoin Metaplanet: $632M purchase, 25,555 BTC total Strive + Semler merger: $675M BTC buy, 10,900 BTC total Institutional Confidence Could Fuel ETF Push The timing of these purchases is important. Espeically, with market regulators relaxing rules around digital asset exposure and Wall Street showing high demand for crypto-linked products, large treasuries may be setting the stage for broader ETF approval. Their confidence not only boosts sentiment but also provides a safety net against deeper sell-offs. As more corporations follow the playbook of Strategy and Metaplanet, Bitcoin could see demand outpace supply, particularly with the capped limit of 21 million coins. If institutional inflows persist, today’s consolidation near $113K may be remembered as a prime accumulation zone. Bitcoin Technical Picture: Key Levels to Watch On the charts, Bitcoin is trading just under the 200-EMA at $113,450, a line that bulls need to reclaim to ease selling pressure. The 50-EMA at $115,500 is the next test, while resistance stands at $116,150 and $118,000. Long lower wicks near $112,500 suggest dip-buying interest, but without a clear reversal candle, sellers still control momentum. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 36 shows oversold conditions, but traders want confirmation before betting on a rebound. If Bitcoin breaks below $113,000, the next supports lie at $110,850 and $108,750. On the upside, a clean break above $114,750 could set the stage for a rally back toward $120,000. For cautious traders, patience is key. Aggressive shorts may aim for $110,800, while long setups require a bullish engulfing pattern or hammer candle near support. Longer term, Bitcoin’s structure of higher lows since summer remains intact, suggesting the current weakness could evolve into an accumulation phase before the next rebound. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining BTC’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $17.5 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012955—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses. You can buy HYPER tokens on the official Bitcoin Hyper website using crypto or a bank card.

Investors who have been sitting on the sidelines, waiting for a sell-off, are now paying attention. Bitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin, known for its larger block size and faster transactions. The recent sell-off from around $650 to $600 has not invalidated the bullish narrative. Momentum indicators remain healthy; for example, the MACD is firmly positive while the RSI hovers around the mid-50s, indicating there is room to run despite recent weakness. The next level of support is far away at around $524, implying the investment narrative remains positive, although there is healthy reason for concern. Meanwhile, Digitap ($TAP) is gaining traction for its no-KYC crypto Visa card. The presale is showing signs of early success, having already raised $100,000 and is on track to hit the $200,000 milestone likely within days, which suggests a much higher level of investor interest in its vision of merging fiat and crypto finance. Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction: $750 – $800 Level Within Reach The bullish case for Bitcoin Cash has not changed over the years. Bitcoin Cash can reach as much as $800, as its low fees and fast confirmations make it a useful tool for everyday spending, including small purchases and cross-border transfers. If more wallets, merchant processors, and e-commerce plugins embrace BCH, the market will award a higher price for the Bitcoin Cash token. Adding to the narrative is the 2024 halving that cut new BCH issuance, so there is less constant sell pressure from miners. Specifically, when issuance falls and on-chain usage modestly rises, prices will move disproportionately. However, there is some risk to the Bitcoin Cash story. If stablecoins on cheap networks gain traction or usage stalls, BCH will lose out on market share. This is not to say that the token will collapse; rather, investors can expect modest gains that result in average or maybe slightly higher-than-average returns. In other words, investors looking for steady gains should appreciate Bitcoin Cash’s story. But those seeking alpha should consider looking elsewhere. For short-term traders and investors asking what is the best crypto to buy, BCH has its appeal, but long-term seekers are looking elsewhere to find what crypto to invest in for 2025 and hold for years. Source: @TheBCHPodcast Digitap Presale: Charging Toward $200K and Changing The Crypto Spend Narrative Even as BCH grabs headlines and the chart still flashes bullish technicals, Digitap is live with its own payment ecosystem. Digitap ’s claim to fame is a no-KYC crypto Visa card, which is a feature that is almost unheard of in the crypto universe. A physical and virtual Visa card is part of Digitap’s unified money-app ecosystem that allows users to spend cryptocurrency or fiat seamlessly. The platform handles compliance in a user-friendly way, and early adopters are optimistic that this is the finance app to control their everyday and long-term financial goals. Digitap’s presale launched at a price of $0.0125 per TAP token and quickly surpassed the $100,000 raised milestone. Digitap’s website includes live updates on its presale, and current data show over 9.1 million $TAP tokens have been sold, generating more than $113,000 raised. This puts Digitap well on its way toward the $200,000 milestone, as the project’s visibility and awareness are only starting to pick up momentum. The presale is structured in stages, and the token’s price will soon increase to $0.0159. Early success makes it clear that investors recognize potential in Digitap’s model, perhaps even viewing it as a 10x or 20x opportunity given its low entry market cap and high utility. Crypto Card Is a Central Attraction It is reasonable to assume that since Digitap’s product is live, most investors took it for a “test run” before investing a single penny. This is no different than test-driving a car before taking it off the lot and represents a feature that very few other crypto projects offer. Like the product and are bullish in its outlook? Then consider it one of the best crypto to invest in right now. The main selling points that investors appreciate include the no-KYC crypto card. According to the project details, Digitap has a geo-compliant onboarding system, which means it automates KYC and AML checks in the background and only requests information that is absolutely necessary. It is also worth noting that the Visa card offers loyalty rewards, and each purchase earns cash-back in the form of $TAP portions. Final Thoughts Bitcoin Cash’s path to $800 is not guaranteed, and there are many other crypto projects with clearer paths ahead. Digitap’s charge toward $200,000 raised, backed by its attractive no-KYC card, shows the forward-looking narrative of the project as it aims to challenge the status quo and change how consumers interact with money on a daily basis. If BCH represents crypto’s past achievements, Digitap might represent future possibilities that have yet to be realized.

52149495,586970,1758636011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52149495.jpeg,JPMorgan To Appear At Ripple Swell: What We Know So Far,https://bitcoinist.com/jpmorgan-ripple-swell/,"The XRP community’s rumor mill just met hard evidence: Ripple’s official Swell speaker roster now lists Scott Lucas, Head of Markets Digital Assets at JP Morgan, among this year’s presenters. Swell 2025 will take place in New York City on November 4–5 (welcome reception on November 3) at Convene Hudson Yards, with Ripple billing it as its ninth annual gathering of “leaders in crypto, blockchain, payments and policy.” JPMorgan Is Joining The Ripple Swell Stage JPMorgan’s appearance is part of a broader Wall Street tilt to the agenda. The same speakers page shows Maxwell Stein (Director, Digital Assets, BlackRock), Ryan Rugg (Global Head of Digital Assets, Treasury & Trade Solutions, Citi), Cynthia Lo Bessette (Head of Fidelity Digital Asset Management, Fidelity), and Kim Hochfeld (Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Cash, Digital & Securities Lending, State Street Investment Management). The published agenda assigns Stein to a capital-markets tokenization discussion with Moody’s, and pairs Rugg and Lo Bessette on a panel about how global banks are shaping digital assets at scale. As of publication, Lucas’s specific session was not listed on the agenda. Lineups are subject to change, but the current program underlines heavyweight TradFi participation. The listing triggered predictable chatter on X. James Rule XRP (@RuleXRP) amplified the update with: “Now JPMorgan is going to be at Ripple Swell? ” Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) went further, asserting: “JPMorgan put their Head of Digital Assets on stage at Ripple Swell 2025. XRP is fully integrated into the banking infrastructure … adoption is inevitable.” Those are community interpretations, not confirmations of product integrations or partnerships; the only verifiable fact at this point is Lucas’s inclusion on Ripple’s official speaker slate. What To Expect Lucas’s remit at JP Morgan is directly relevant to what Swell typically explores. He oversees the strategy and execution of new trading products built on DLT/blockchain and represents the bank in industry initiatives; he also holds board roles at HQLAx and Ownera, and serves on the board of CLS Group—all touchpoints in the market plumbing of tokenized collateral, securities finance and post-trade. Context matters: JPMorgan has built one of the industry’s most advanced permissioned- blockchain stacks for wholesale finance. Its Onyx (now Kinexys Digital Assets) platforms span JPM Coin and tokenized-collateral rails used in repo and liquidity operations; recent milestones include tokenized MMF collateral and on-chain intraday repo workflows. That program has processed large volumes and is expanding to third-party apps—developments that dovetail with Swell’s tokenization and market-infrastructure themes. None of this implies an XRP integration; it does explain why a senior JP Morgan digital-assets executive belongs in the conversation Swell curates. What to watch from here is straightforward. First, Swell’s New York program already confirms BlackRock’s tokenization talk and a joint Citi–Fidelity panel on bank adoption—useful signaling about where institutional priorities sit in late 2025. Second, keep an eye on the agenda for a named session involving JPMorgan’s Lucas; as of now, only his speaker listing is public.

After losing the $115,000 level earlier this week, BTC is now fighting to hold $110,000, a threshold that many investors see as critical for maintaining short-term stability. The sharp drop has shaken confidence, with traders increasingly concerned about the possibility of a deeper correction if support fails. Related Reading: Aster Forms Bullish Hammer At Key Support – Reversal Setup? Market sentiment has shifted quickly from bullish optimism to caution, as volatility rises and momentum fades. The broader crypto market has mirrored Bitcoin’s moves, with altcoins also suffering significant declines. This phase of consolidation and retracement has left investors uncertain, unsure whether the recent dip represents a temporary pullback or the beginning of a larger corrective phase. Amid this turbulence, top analyst Darkfost highlighted a key onchain signal: it has been another painful day for short-term holders (STHs). Data shows that STHs realized losses of around 30,000 BTC in just one day. For many of the most recent buyers, unrealized profits have already evaporated, with some now selling at steep losses. Bitcoin STH Face Losses, But Market Outlook Holds Darkfost’s recent analysis highlights the mounting pressure on Bitcoin’s short-term holders (STHs). With BTC trading near $111,400, most of their unrealized profits have been nearly wiped out, leaving the newest market entrants facing realized losses. Data shows that STHs collectively absorbed an estimated 30,000 BTC in losses in a single day, underscoring the severity of the recent correction. For traders, this has been painful, but Darkfost argues it is actually constructive for the short-term outlook. He explains that when STHs capitulate, it often acts as a cleansing event for the market. Excessive leverage is flushed out, weak hands exit their positions, and the supply overhang diminishes. While “annoying in the very, very short term,” as Darkfost puts it, such resets typically create stronger foundations for the next move higher. This pattern has been observed in previous cycles, where brief periods of realized losses paved the way for sustained rallies once selling pressure subsided. At the macro level, conditions remain challenging as global markets digest tighter liquidity and slower economic growth. Still, many analysts believe Bitcoin is well-positioned in the long run, particularly as institutional adoption and regulatory clarity progress. In their view, current volatility may simply be part of the transition toward a healthier and more resilient market structure. Related Reading: Crypto Leverage Whipeout: $600M+ In BTC & ETH Longs Liquidated Price Analysis: Testing Support After Breakdown Bitcoin’s price action shows clear weakness after losing the $115K level, with the chart now testing support near $113K. The breakdown comes as the bullish momentum that fueled previous rallies fades, leaving BTC vulnerable to volatility. Currently, price trades below the 50-day moving average, signaling pressure in the short term. The 100-day SMA around $113,337 is now acting as a key support level, and its defense will be crucial to avoid a deeper correction. The recent drop highlights a rejection near the $123K resistance zone, where the market failed to build sustained momentum. If Bitcoin manages to hold above the $113K area, consolidation could follow before another attempt at recovery. However, a decisive move below this level risks exposing BTC to the $110K psychological level, where buyers are likely to step in. Related Reading: Tron Integration Marks Next Phase Of PayPal USD’s Multi-Chain Growth – Details Momentum indicators suggest the market remains in a corrective phase rather than a full reversal, with higher lows still intact from June levels. As long as BTC avoids a breakdown below $110K, the broader bullish structure remains valid. Traders will closely watch whether Bitcoin can stabilize above its current support or whether further selling pressure from long-term holders and broader market uncertainty drags it lower.

Since its debut in May 2025, Bybit’s stock CFD offering has expanded to support more than 100 equities, spanning leading technology firms such as NVDA (NVIDIA), MSTR (MicroStrategy), and META (Meta Platforms), as well as crypto-related stocks including COIN and CRCL. To further broaden accessibility, Bybit TradFi is also waiving trading fees on stock CFDs and indices through Oct. 11, 2025. During this limited-time program, eligible users can trade a range of global indices — including CHINA50, CHINAH, HK50, HKTECH, and TWINDEX — as well as all stock CFDs such as CRCL, COIN, MSTR, BMNR, SBET, and major technology equities including NVDA, TSLA, AAPL, GOOG, and INTC, at zero transaction cost. Previously, Bybit’s stock CFD trading followed standard U.S. market hours, limiting access to approximately 6.5 hours per day. Under those constraints, traders unable to act within the daily market window could not adjust positions or hedge risk until the next session. By introducing 24/5 trading, Bybit reduces time-zone barriers, enables continuous risk management, and allows users worldwide to respond more effectively to market developments. The change also provides cross-asset traders with a more unified experience, bridging the gap between crypto’s 24/7 market and traditional finance products. Key benefits of the update include: Always available: Stock CFDs on U.S. equities can now be traded around the clock, Monday through Friday. Global accessibility: Extended hours reduce time-zone limitations and open participation to a wider base of traders. Greater control: Users can manage positions on their own schedule, rather than being restricted to U.S. market hours. Bybit is among the first crypto-native platforms to introduce 24/5 trading for traditional financial assets. The company has positioned the expansion as part of its broader mission to bridge digital assets and traditional finance, while redefining the future of multi-asset trading.

For those deeply invested in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, understanding the nuances of the US stock market crypto relationship is absolutely crucial. While digital assets often march to their own beat, these traditional market movements can send ripples across the entire investment landscape, including your crypto portfolio. What Does a Mixed Stock Market Opening Mean for Crypto? On a recent trading day, we observed a fascinating split in traditional markets. The S&P 500 dipped slightly by 0.02%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell by 0.04%. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed a positive uptick, gaining 0.15%. This mixed bag of performance in the US stock market crypto context isn’t just an isolated event; it often reflects underlying economic sentiment that can influence investor behavior across all asset classes. S&P 500 & Nasdaq: Often seen as indicators of broader market health and tech sector performance, their slight declines could signal caution. Dow Jones: Its modest gain might point to strength in traditional industrial or value stocks, suggesting a rotation of capital. Such divergence can create uncertainty, prompting investors to reassess their risk appetite. This reassessment directly impacts how capital flows, potentially affecting the volatile crypto market. Navigating the Interconnectedness: US Stock Market Crypto Dynamics Many believe that cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, act as a “digital gold” – a safe haven asset independent of traditional finance. However, recent years have shown a growing correlation between major cryptocurrencies and the stock market, particularly the Nasdaq. When the stock market faces headwinds, investors might pull back from riskier assets, and unfortunately, crypto is often categorized as such. Consider the macroeconomic factors at play. Inflation concerns, interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, and geopolitical events don’t just affect company earnings; they also influence liquidity and investor confidence. These factors create a powerful link between the US stock market crypto ecosystems. Key Dynamics to Observe: Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment: When traditional markets are “risk-off” (investors prefer safer assets), crypto often sees outflows. Conversely, a “risk-on” environment can fuel crypto rallies. Institutional Adoption: As more institutional money flows into crypto, its sensitivity to traditional market shifts increases. These large players often manage diversified portfolios where crypto is just one component. Therefore, a mixed stock market opening can signal a period of indecision or re-evaluation among these larger market participants. What Do Mixed Signals Mean for Your Crypto Portfolio? For the individual crypto investor, these mixed signals from the US stock market crypto interaction can be a source of both challenge and opportunity. It’s a reminder that no market exists in a vacuum. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have their unique supply-demand dynamics, they are not entirely immune to broader economic forces. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Uncertainty in traditional markets can amplify volatility in crypto, leading to sharper price swings. Difficulty in Prediction: Mixed signals make it harder to predict short-term crypto movements based solely on stock market performance. Opportunities: Diversification Reassessment: It’s a good time to review your portfolio’s diversification strategy. Are you overly exposed to a single asset class? Long-Term Perspective: For those with a long-term vision, market dips influenced by traditional market sentiment can present attractive entry points. Understanding these connections helps in making more informed decisions rather than reacting impulsively to daily price fluctuations. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Enthusiast So, how should crypto enthusiasts respond to a mixed traditional market opening and its implications for the US stock market crypto landscape? It’s about being prepared and strategic. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on key economic indicators and major stock market movements, not just crypto news. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Continue with a consistent investment strategy, regardless of short-term market noise. This helps mitigate risk. Research Projects: Focus on the fundamentals of the crypto projects you invest in. Strong projects with real utility are more likely to weather market storms. Manage Risk: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Set clear stop-loss orders or take-profit targets to protect your capital. Remember, the crypto market is still relatively young and continues to mature. Its relationship with traditional finance is evolving, making continuous learning and adaptability key. Crucial Takeaways: Navigating the Interconnected Markets The mixed opening of the major U.S. stock indexes serves as a timely reminder of the complex interplay between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. While the US stock market crypto relationship isn’t always one-to-one, ignoring it would be a disservice to informed investing. Crypto investors must remain vigilant, understand the broader economic context, and apply sound investment principles. By doing so, you can better position your portfolio to navigate both the challenges and exciting opportunities that lie ahead in these interconnected financial realms. Frequently Asked Questions About US Stock Market Crypto Dynamics Here are some common questions regarding the interaction between traditional stock markets and the crypto world: Q1: Do stock market movements always predict crypto price action? A1: Not always. While there’s a growing correlation, especially with Bitcoin and Ethereum, crypto can still have independent movements driven by unique factors like technological developments, regulatory news, or specific project adoption. It’s a relationship of influence, not direct causation. Q2: Why is the Nasdaq often more correlated with crypto than the Dow? A2: The Nasdaq is heavily weighted with technology stocks, which are often considered “growth” or “risk-on” assets. Crypto, being a relatively new and volatile asset class, is also often viewed as a “risk-on” investment, leading to similar investor sentiment and capital flows during periods of market optimism or caution. Q3: Should I adjust my crypto investments based on daily stock market news? A3: Frequent adjustments based on daily news can lead to impulsive decisions. It’s better to understand the broader trends and macroeconomic factors. For most investors, a long-term strategy like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and focusing on project fundamentals is more effective than reacting to short-term fluctuations. Q4: Can crypto act as a hedge against stock market volatility? A4: Historically, Bitcoin was sometimes seen as a hedge, but its correlation with tech stocks has increased. While it offers diversification due to its unique characteristics, its high volatility means it might not always provide the stability of traditional safe-haven assets during stock market downturns. It depends on the specific market conditions. Q5: What are “risk-on” and “risk-off” sentiments in investing? A5: “Risk-on” sentiment occurs when investors feel confident and are willing to invest in riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies, seeking higher returns. “Risk-off” sentiment happens during periods of uncertainty or fear, leading investors to move capital into safer assets like government bonds, gold, or stablecoins, even if returns are lower.
