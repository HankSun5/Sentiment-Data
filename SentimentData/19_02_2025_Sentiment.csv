Here’s the Best Altcoin to Buy and Hold in 2025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-your-portfolio-stuck-heres-the-best-altcoin-to-buy-and-hold-in-2025/,"Investors hunting for explosive growth in the crypto market are turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending platform whose presale is rapidly gaining momentum. Over $665,000 has already been secured in the opening phase of the presale, with more than 1,050 holders claiming stakes at the current price of $0.01 per token. 60% of Phase One tokens sold out within days and the project is demonstrating a level of demand rarely seen in early-stage crypto ventures. For early buyers, this translates to a guaranteed 600% return at launch and a potential 100x surge within two years. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Platform Built for Real-World Use Mutuum Finance (MUTM) addresses a critical need in decentralized finance: accessible, secure lending and borrowing. The platform allows users to either deposit assets into liquidity pools for passive income or borrow funds against their crypto holdings without selling them. Lenders earn variable yields tied to market demand, while borrowers retain ownership of their collateralized assets, a win-win structure attracting both cautious earners and strategic traders. Take Ethereum (ETH) holders, for example. By locking 10 ETH as collateral, they can borrow stablecoins to fund other investments or expenses, all while benefiting if ETH’s value climbs. This flexibility eliminates the need to liquidate positions during market dips, a feature resonating with investors seeking long-term portfolio growth. Driving Demand Through Innovation Beyond its core lending services, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rolling out an overcollateralized stablecoin backed by on-chain reserves. Designed to maintain price stability, this asset will streamline borrowing processes and enhance trust in the ecosystem. As decentralized finance platforms increasingly rely on stablecoins for transactions, Mutuum’s integration positions it to capture a larger share of this booming market. The project further distinguishes itself with a buy-and-distribute mechanism. A percentage of platform fees will automatically purchase MUTM tokens from the open market, redistributing them to stakers. This system creates continuous buying pressure, directly linking platform activity to token value appreciation. Combined with plans to launch a beta version of its platform alongside exchange listings, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is engineering conditions for sustained growth long after its presale concludes. Presale Momentum Builds Rapidly Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has strategically priced its presale to reward early participants. Phase One offers tokens at $0.01. At launch, the token will list at $0.06, locking in a 600% gain for Phase One buyers. With over half of the initial allocation already claimed, the window for securing tokens at this entry point is narrowing quickly. Historical patterns in the crypto market show that projects launching with functional platforms see sharper price increases post-listing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is following this blueprint, ensuring its beta lending platform goes live simultaneously with exchange listings. This operational readiness is critica. It allows immediate user adoption, driving transaction volume and liquidity from day one. To accelerate community growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is allocating $100,000 to a giveaway split among ten participants. The campaign, detailed on the project’s official channels, requires simple social media engagement. Such initiatives not only reward early supporters but also amplify visibility, drawing more investors to the presale before Phase One closes. Crypto analysts are unanimous; tokens with clear utility and built-in demand drivers outperform speculative assets during bull markets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) checks both boxes. Its lending platform solves real problems for DeFi users, while its tokenomics create scarcity through buybacks and staking rewards. Experts point to these factors when forecasting a rise to $1 in 2025, a 100x leap from the current presale price.

The choice of the best altcoin to buy in the U.S. usually involves a very close understanding of the trends in the market, new innovations, and their long-term prospects. For example, according to CoinMarketCap, Solana (SOL) is trading at $191.91 , with a 2.84% decrease in the last 24 hours. Dogecoin (DOGE) stands at $0.251 , down 3.22%, and Ethereum (ETH) trades at $2,627 , dropping by 2.89%. With such fluctuations, investors need to focus on tokens that offer stability, utility, and excellent future promise. Why the Market is Shifting Towards Smarter Investments An altcoin entered the U.S. market with uninterrupted DeFi solutions. The platform adapted to changing regulations, ensuring compliance and user trust at all times. Consequently, its rise indicated the dawn of a new era for decentralized finance. Investors seek platforms offering real-world utilities and adopt projects incorporating AI, automation, and financial tools. One such project making waves is RCO Finance (RCOF) , which is making a strong claim as the best altcoin to buy. Most altcoins use only hype, but RCOF combines AI-powered trading and real-world asset investment with a seamless DeFi experience. Central to its design is its AI-based Robo Advisor, which gives it an edge with intelligent investment insights drafted specifically for each user’s portfolio. In 2021, Squid Game Token (SQUID), inspired by the popular Netflix series, skyrocketed to over $2,800 before crashing to nearly zero in days, leaving investors with significant losses. The Robo Advisor could have flagged early signs, such as large withdrawals and alarming reductions in reserves for stakeholders to exit before the crash, reducing investors’ exposure to risk. RCOF: A Smarter Way to Trade and Invest RCO Finance is changing the entire paradigm of investment strategies by providing access to more than 120,000 assets within 12,500 asset classes, including stocks, bonds, and tokenized real-world assets like real estate, wallets, and commodities. This makes sure that crypto investors diversify away from conventional crypto trading. It also offers automated market-making, providing liquidity while rewarding users on DEXs. This provision entails users’ active participation in the DeFi ecosystem by joining liquidity pools to earn returns. With RCO Finance, up to 1000x leverage is available, allowing maximum returns with little capital across many asset classes. Such high-leverage provision is rare, once again solidifying RCOF’s position as the best altcoin to buy now. The Altcoin Fueling the Future of DeFi Private Syndicate ETF Funds offered by RCO Finance permit investors to consolidate their finance in diversified ETFs across numerous asset classes. Hence, crypto investors can reap the benefits from the constant proven strength of ETFs. Additionally, it uses a non-KYC model, which guarantees privacy and anonymity to users. This ensures that users can access decentralized finance products without going through verification processes. Asset purchases using cryptocurrencies can also be made via this platform, allowing investments in stocks, bonds, and real estate. An audit by SolidProof has been carried out on RCO Finance and is a mark of assurance for smart contracts and risks of exploit minimization. Consequently, investors feel secure that their funds are safe while remaining confident in RCOF. RCO Finance has also launched its Beta platform , where its users can test what the next cutting-edge functionalities would look like. Over 10,000 users have joined to test the ecosystem and give valuable feedback. Seize the Opportunity and Invest in RCO Finance Today Having sold over 13 million tokens, analysts believe the token could launch even higher than the projected $0.6, generating massive returns for early investors. Currently, RCOF is in the presale stage at the price of $0.10, which is expected to go up by 30% to $0.13 in the next stage. This makes it the best altcoin to buy right now, offering a golden opportunity to invest before the price surges! If you invest $1,000 today, you could get $70,000 profit post-listing. Don’t miss this opportunity to become part of the finance revolution. The platform also recently announced a giveaway of $100,000, with early investors able to take part in this massive offer. For those who missed out on early Solana (SOL) or Ethereum (ETH) investments, this is another chance to be a part of something equally, if not more revolutionary.

Web3Bay’s DAO Redefines E-Commerce – Explosive Presale Growth Expected!",https://thecoinrise.com/cast-your-vote-shape-your-market-web3bays-dao-redefines-e-commerce-explosive-presale-growth-expected/,"Today’s e-commerce giants like Amazon and eBay operate under a top-heavy, centralized framework that dictates policies and fees, leaving little room for user input. Enter Web3Bay, a game changer in online shopping that empowers its community through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This pioneering approach hands the reins of control back to the users. A DAO operates on a blockchain framework where decisions are democratically made by token holders, not a central figure. Ownership of Web3Bay ’s 3BAY token provides a ticket to this democratic process, allowing users to vote on key matters such as fee structures, platform updates, seller regulations, and security enhancements. By removing middlemen and enabling community-driven decisions, Web3Bay is creating an open and accountable ecosystem. This shift ensures that the platform evolves according to the needs and wants of its actual users, rather than the financial agendas of distant executives. Web3Bay Presale Success & Market Dynamics Web3Bay’s initial token offering is quickly gaining momentum, reflecting strong market faith in its revolutionary model. As of February 17, 2025, the initiative has amassed over $1.4 million, with more than 360 million tokens distributed at $0.004562625 each. This robust engagement underscores the market’s appetite for decentralized e-commerce solutions. Spanning 28 stages, the presale sees a consistent 15% hike in token price per stage. Now at Stage 4, each 3BAY token stands at $0.004562, anticipated to soar to $0.1959 by launch. This structured price ascent offers early backers substantial potential gains, mirroring the trajectories of previously successful blockchain projects. Unlike typical blockchain marketplaces focused solely on NFT transactions, such as OpenSea and Rarible, Web3Bay integrates DAO into everyday e-commerce. It allows its community to dictate everything from fees to seller standards and conflict resolution, marking a rare but significant stride in the industry and solidifying its competitive edge. Why Web3Bay’s DAO Model Is Transformative for E-Commerce Decentralized governance through DAO offers several transformative advantages for the e-commerce sector: Transparency & Trust : Each decision is immutably recorded on the blockchain, ensuring clarity and fairness in governance, free from manipulation. Community-Driven Rules : The platform adapts through community consensus rather than top-down mandates, reflecting the true needs and preferences of its users. Reduced Costs & Equitable Transactions : By cutting out traditional operational overheads and decentralizing control, Web3Bay minimizes fees and fosters fair trade practices. Enhanced Security with Smart Contracts : Automated escrow systems bolster transaction security, safeguarding against common e-commerce risks such as fraud and counterfeit listings. Web3Bay’s commitment to a DAO-based model resonates with the broader move toward decentralization seen across various sectors. Successful DAOs like Uniswap and MakerDAO have demonstrated the efficacy of governance tokens in balancing user empowerment with operational efficiency. By adopting this governance model, Web3Bay is not just participating in the market—it’s redefining the rules of engagement for the digital marketplace. With a thriving presale and a robust, community-first governance structure, Web3Bay is poised to lead the charge in the new wave of decentralized retail. As blockchain technology becomes more mainstream, the evolution towards user-managed marketplaces seems destined. Web3Bay isn’t merely launching another e-commerce platform; it’s pioneering an era of equitable, transparent, and community-focused shopping.

Nigerian Lawmaker Denies Crypto Ties, Sues for Defamation According to a local news outlet , Agbese is seeking a declaration that Gambaryan’s statements were defamatory, an order preventing him from making further claims, and a public retraction of the allegations. He also demands ₦1 billion in general damages and an additional ₦5 million to cover legal expenses. The controversy stems from social media posts in which Gambaryan accused Agbese and two other legislators of attempting to secure a $150 million bribe through cryptocurrency transactions. The claims quickly gained traction online and were widely reported by Nigerian media outlets, including Channels Television and Blueprint.

The lawsuit asserts that Agbese has never owned a cryptocurrency account or engaged in digital currency transactions. In addition to financial compensation, the lawsuit demands that Gambaryan issue a public apology in at least three national newspapers and remove all social media posts containing the allegations. The suit also seeks a court injunction to prevent further dissemination of the claims. The Nigerian government has also intervened in the matter. On February 14, 2025, the Minister of Information and National Orientation dismissed Gambaryan’s accusations, stating that no credible evidence had been presented to support them.

Binance Exec Tigran Gambaryan Freed After Months in Nigerian Detention Tigran Gambaryan, a Binance executive specializing in financial crime compliance, was arrested in Nigeria in February 2024 on money laundering charges during a business trip. His colleague, Nadeem Anjarwalla, managed to escape to Kenya , but Gambaryan remained detained at Kuje Correctional Center. Binance has consistently denied wrongdoing and called for his release, arguing that he was not a company decision-maker. The exchange also alleged that Nigerian officials requested a secret payment to resolve the issue, a claim the Nigerian government denies .

His detention led to severe health complications, including pneumonia, malaria, and a herniated disk that left him reliant on crutches. Despite medical reports recommending surgery, his requests for medical attention were repeatedly denied . The court ordered Gambaryan to pay a $2,000 fine for overstaying his visa before returning to the U.S . Despite all these legal attacks, Binance continues to dispute these allegations and is engaging with Nigerian officials to resolve the matter. Looking forward, the court has ordered Gambaryan to respond to its new lawsuit within eight days. Notices will be served through Nigerian media or his legal team. If he fails to respond, the court may proceed in his absence. Crypto, Politics, and Defamation: A Nigerian Court Showdown The legal clash between Nigerian lawmaker Philip Agbese and Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan highlights tensions between politics and the crypto industry. Agbese has filed a ₦1 billion defamation suit, asserting that false claims of a bribery attempt have harmed his public image. Meanwhile, Gambaryan—previously cleared of money laundering charges—now faces another court challenge. This dispute reflects Nigeria’s struggle to regulate cryptocurrencies while balancing innovation and accountability. As the proceedings continue, the ruling may not only settle a personal dispute but also redefine accountability for both public figures and crypto companies, setting a precedent for how weighty online claims are addressed in a digital society.

It is experiencing a tolerable 2% weekly loss as cautious traders reduce yields, volatility, and market turnovers to new lows. During the K33 report launch , the head of research, Vetle Lunde, indicated that the pro-crypto administration headed by President Trump had a long-term positive effect on Bitcoin and the entire industry. However, there is a short-term uncertainty that makes the market lethargic. Lunde said in a report on Tuesday: Bitcoin metrics are softening across all corners of the market. Volumes, yields, options premiums, and ETF flows have moved to areas not seen since before the election. Alongside these lethargic conditions, volatilities have plunged to multi-month lows. Vetle Lunde While comparing Bitcoin’s volatility to the top 100 U.S. companies, Lunde said that 37% of the firms currently show higher 30-day volatility than Bitcoin. Such crazy levels were last seen in October 2023. He further pointed out that periods of low volatility are temporary and rarely last longer; therefore, traders must be ready for a sudden shift. Low premiums are indications of weaker market performance The research further indicated that CME Bitcoin Futures shows premiums have recently dropped past 5%, a rare occurrence. The data from 2021 to 2025 shows that low premiums always coincide with weaker market performance. In futures trading, the basis refers to the difference between an asset’s futures and spot prices. A premium occurs when futures prices exceed spot prices, often signaling bullish sentiment, while a discount suggests bearish conditions. Lunde insists that Bitcoin always performs better in a strong basis regime and asks traders to be cautious during the current market uncertainty. The short-term time frame shows that the $BTC price continues to roll over after breaking through the top of the descending wedge. If this downtrend continues, the next horizontal support is $94,000, and the bottom range is $92,000. Just below this is the major ascending trendline that stretches back to the 2021 bull market. Bitcoin price remains uncertain, but the potential of an uptrend is still intact on the week A keen look at the weekly $BTC chart reveals how the prices have gone sideways over extended periods in the current bull market. The position is very healthy and will probably lead to a higher top than if the price keeps climbing. Looking at this chart, the bear might say that an M-top chart pattern may be playing out. Of course, this is always a possibility. However, the trend is still upward until the price falls and confirms below the current range, the bottom of which is bolstered by the ascending trendline. At the foot of the chart, the Stochastic RSI, which highlights price strength, has its indicators hitting the lowest point. If they turn back and climb over the 20.00 level, the renewed upward price force can push $BTC from its current range to the next new level. This will likely begin taking place in less than a month.

Macro Set-Up For Bitcoin And Ethereum Surge While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana face a downtrend due to rising volatility, Pal remains steadfast in his optimistic projection, believing that the market is in the greatest macro target of all time. The Real Vision CEO shared a series of thread posts on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting technical indicators and macro factors that would positively influence Bitcoin and Ethereum’s price trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forms Double Bottom After Crash, Is A Bounce To $112,000 ATH Possible? Sharing a logarithmic weekly chart of Bitcoin, Pal indicated that Bitcoin had experienced a long-term price uptrend line since 2020, showing a distinct pattern of higher lows. Currently, Bitcoin is moving within a tight trading range, which Pal believes could be bullish, as a strong break above the resistance line could trigger a major run. Similarly, the Real Vision Co-founder presented a price chart of Ethereum, highlighting that ETH is currently consolidated within a symmetrical triangle, signaling the potential for a price breakout. Typically, a symmetrical triangle pattern is seen as a bullish signal for ETH, but considering its recent underperformance compared to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana, a strong bullish breakout remains skeptical. Looking at the symmetrical triangle, a breakout from the upper trendline could see the Ethereum price skyrocketing to $4,000 or even higher based on Pal’s chart. Additionally, the Solana price, which has been seeing varying momentum lately, has tested a key horizontal resistance multiple times, forming a strong accumulation base. Historically such consolidation phases tend to precede explosive rallies, provided that broader market trends remain favorable. In his post, Pal encourages traders to “zoom out” , likely suggesting a shift from short-term fluctuations to long term cycles. He warned against excessive leverage and risk-taking to avoid liquidation in volatile conditions. He also urges traders to remain patient, watching how the market unfolds and preparing ahead of a potential bullish surge. Market Volatility Raises Fear In his analysis, Pal suggested that the broader crypto market is currently plagued by fear and panic, as volatility rises and crypto prices experience a downtrend. He explains that a significant portion of crypto investors or traders are currently bearish.

Due to this market change, many in the market had sold off their tokens to avoid further losses. Despite this bearish trend, Pal maintains an optimistic outlook, expecting a strong surge for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.

Tether co-founder Reeve Collins is now the chairman and co-founder of Pi Protocol, the maker of a new USDT competitor, USP, Bloomberg reports . The Pi stablecoin is scheduled to roll out on the Solana ( SOL ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchains later this year. Pi aims to use smart contracts to execute transactions and mint the USP stablecoin, which aims to be backed by bonds and other yield-bearing real-world assets. The project aims to be more decentralized than other stablecoin projects, such as Tether’s USDT, giving users a larger piece of the pie, according to the report. Says Collins on the new stablecoin, “I very much supported Tether over the years, it’s an extraordinary invention that we’ve developed… We view Pi Protocol as the evolution of stablecoins. Tether has been extremely successful in showcasing demand for stablecoins. But they keep all the yield. We believe 10 years later the market is really ready to evolve.” Says Pi CEO Bundeep Singh Rangar of the new crypto project, “You want assets that are non-correlated to crypto that are mid- to high yield, low risk. We have a mechanism that assesses the quality of the asset. They are ones that are vetted on their loss ratio and origination of where they are coming from.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Catzilla, a rising Solana-based meme coin, is making waves and positioning itself as a potential challenger to Litecoin and Polkadot. Table of Contents Catzilla: The monstrous meme coin Why Catzilla could be the next crypto heavyweight Conclusion The crypto market is buzzing with a potential new star on the horizon. Catzilla, a promising Solana-based project, is gaining attention for its growth potential. With the current bull run in full swing, enthusiasts are speculating whether this newcomer can challenge established giants like Litecoin (LTC) and Polkadot (DOT). Catzilla: The monstrous meme coin In the ever-chaotic meme coin battleground, Catzilla emerges as a behemoth ready to demolish the status quo. Unlike the usual dog-themed tokens that flood the market, Catzilla introduces an entirely new narrative — an unstoppable kaiju-cat storming through the crypto scene with fiery ambition. Inspired by the legendary appeal of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe, this token blends meme culture with real financial opportunity. What sets Catzilla apart isn’t just its name — it’s the movement it represents. This Solana-based sensation fuses anime aesthetics, gaming mechanics, and a decentralized vision to create a new kind of meme token experience. With a rebellious edge and a commitment to financial freedom, Catzilla is uniting crypto enthusiasts, gamers, and meme lovers in a battle against outdated financial systems. Why Catzilla stands out: Massive ROI potential: Catzilla’s presale features 14 stages, allowing early investors to capitalize on a rise from $0.0002 to $0.0016 — a massive 700% increase before its official launch. Game-changing narrative: While most meme coins focus solely on hype, Catzilla weaves an immersive kaiju-inspired storyline, giving the community a reason to rally beyond mere speculation. Triple utility model: Catzilla isn’t just a meme — it offers value through gameplay integration, a powerful community movement, and a fun yet lucrative crypto ecosystem. More than just another meme coin, Catzilla is here to redefine what it means to be a digital asset in the modern market.

The project offers a hybrid model that taps into multiple lucrative crypto sectors. Its threefold strategy — combining meme-driven virality, interactive gaming elements, and a decentralized mission — positions it as a force to be reckoned with. More than a payment coin: Litecoin’s appeal lies in its efficiency for transactions. Catzilla expands beyond payments by integrating gaming incentives and DeFi opportunities. Beyond interoperability: Polkadot enhances blockchain connectivity. On the other hand, Catzilla fosters community engagement and reward-driven ecosystems. Massive growth potential: With a presale offering up to 700% ROI, Catzilla’s early-stage opportunity challenges the stagnation seen in older altcoins. By embracing innovation while staying true to the playful spirit of meme coins, Catzilla isn’t just entering the arena — it’s redefining it. As the crypto market shifts towards high-engagement assets, Catzilla has the potential to outpace traditional altcoins and cement itself as a leader in the next wave of blockchain growth. Conclusion While Litecoin and Polkadot show less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as a meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom. Offering a 700% ROI during its presale — from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages — Catzilla’s triple utility empowers holders and unites them to join the fight against crypto villains.

The newly acquired licenses will allow LTP HK to deal in securities and futures contracts, advise on securities and futures contracts, and manage assets. LTP HK became the first prime brokerage focused on virtual assets to secure a comprehensive suite of HK SFC licenses. LTP announced today that its subsidiary LTP HK had secured types 1, 2, 4, 5, and 9 licenses from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (HK SFC). LTP HK became the first prime brokerage to deal in securities and futures contracts, advise on securities and futures contracts, and manage assets. LTP disclosed that LTP HK was now licensed to offer a range of financial services to institutional clients, including proprietary trading firms, hedge funds, asset managers, and corporate investors. According to LTP, the regulatory achievement solidified LTP HK’s credibility and leadership within the dynamic financial services landscape. Jack Young, the founder and CEO of LTP, said regulatory compliance was the ‘fundamental pillar’ of the firm’s institutional prime brokerage services. He added that LTP was committed to serving institutional clients who demanded secure high-performance trading infrastructure. LTP HK increases its financial service offerings with new HK SFC licenses LTP announced that its Hong Kong subsidiary, LTP HK, had gained approval for a type 1 HK SFC license, which allowed the company to deal in securities. LTP HK also received type 2 licensing, allowing it to deal in futures contracts. Types 4 and 5 licenses authorized LTP HK to advise on securities and futures contracts, respectively. The type 9 SFC license allowed LTP HK to engage in regulated asset management. HK SFC recently announced its swift licensing process and revamped the second phase of its assessment of virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs). The agency disclosed that its proactive engagement and enhanced communication with VATPs to provide direct and effective guidance on its expected regulatory standards were key to the swift licensing process. LTP stated that the LTP HK’s approvals from the HK SFC aligned with the company’s commitment to regulatory compliance, institutional-grade services offering, and investor protection. “This regulatory milestone marks a strategic leap forward in our mission to bridge traditional finance with digital asset innovation.” -Ethan Wang, CEO of LiquidityTech Limited (LTP HK) Wang added that LTP HK was set to empower institutions with compliant customer-protected solutions that drove growth in evolving markets as Hong Kong cemented ‘its role as a global hub for financial innovation.’ The HK SFC had earlier identified various deficiencies and substandard conduct during the course of its supervision of licensed corporations engaged in asset management. Hong Kong SFC streamlines licenses for virtual asset managers The HK SFC recently published a circular detailing a new streamlined licensing process that now applies to all new applicants for a virtual asset trading platform (VATP) license. The single external assessment conducted after the applicant had implemented all its internal systems and controls replaced the two-phased external assessment previously required. Previously, applicants for virtual asset trading platform licenses–under the HK SFC’s Scope of External Assessment Reports published in June 2023–were required to engage an external assessor to submit two assessment reports to the SFC. The phase 1 report was submitted with the license application, and the effectiveness of the design of the license applicant’s proposed policies was assessed. The phase 2 report was submitted by an external assessor after the SFC granted approval-in-principle of the virtual asset trading platform license application and assessed the effectiveness of the policies, procedures, and the systems and controls actually implemented. External assessors are required to submit only one assessment report under the new streamlined licensing process. HK SFC confirmed that assessment was required to ensure that a VATP applicant’s systems and controls, policies, and procedures were suitably designed and implemented to meet the requirements of the SFC’s VATP and AML/CFT guidelines. The circular contained no details of the required terms of reference, scope, and specific areas to be covered by the single assessment report. According to the HK SFC, these details were available in the now defunct Scope of External Assessment Reports.",Press Release,EN,0,0,ASIA|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-18 23:04:00

40517288,https://coingape.com/?p=239683,1739920676,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Bitwise Donates To Open Source Bitcoin Development Amid Market Downturn,https://coingape.com/bitwise-donates-to-open-source-bitcoin-development/,"Asset management firm Bitwise has unveiled a new donation to support open-source innovation of the Bitcoin network. According to the firm’s update, this latest donation aligns with its promise to give back after its Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ($BITB) launch in January 2024. Bitwise Aim to Boost Bitcoin Development At the time, Bitwise hinted at its plan to give 10% of its gross profits each year to charity. In a recent development, the asset manager announced the donation, saying it is finally fulfilling its promise to the public. Bitwise revealed on X that it will donate $150,000 to support Bitcoin’s open-source developers. The fund is designed to encourage developers who work tirelessly to secure and maintain the Bitcoin network. This is the first annual donation since the promise was made. Bitwise intends to allocate the funds to three non-profit organizations: Bitcoin Brink, Open Sats, and the Human Rights Foundation (HRF). It believes these entities already have established track records within the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. “Thank you to the investors who’ve chosen Bitwise and BITB among many options. This donation is made possible because of your choice. We hope you’re as proud as we are to support Bitcoin open-source developers,” Bitwise wrote on X. The Donation Rationale Significantly, this donation may trigger increased participation from developers as it promotes innovation and ensures the security of blockchain technology. Markedly, these open-source developers are crucial to the health status of the Bitcoin blockchain and, by extension, the broader crypto sector. The asset manager believes a donation of $150,000 could attract more talent into the ecosystem. Moreover, this funding positions Bitwise as a firm with futuristic goals and community links. This donation could also attract goodwill to the Bitcoin ETF issuer. Just like it does for Bitcoin, Bitwise also has staking pools, which is its way of supporting the Ethereum ecosystem, which also has ETF ties. The Bitwise Donation Timing Bitwise’s move coincides with the season in which the crypto sector is receiving more favorable policies. Several firms are submitting applications to list multiple crypto ETFs. They are encouraged by the improved trajectory of the crypto sector under President Donald Trump. Even Bitwise filed to list spot XRP ETF weeks ago. The US SEC has acknowledged this XRP ETF filing , officially kickstarting the countdown for the approval The Commission had earlier acknowledged a similar filing from 21Shares a week ago. Through the crypto task force , many are positive the filing will gain approval amid broad rules review.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Solana stalls, attention is shifting to Rollblock for its massive growth potential. Table of Contents Rollblock poised for 100x rally Is Solana facing another correction? Conclusion As the crypto market shifts between uncertainty and opportunity, investors are eagerly searching for the next 100x contender. While Solana (SOL) struggles to reclaim its January highs, a rising star is capturing market attention. Rollblock’s GameFi ecosystem, security, and staking model have helped it raise over $10 million in record time. Rollblock poised for 100x rally Rollblock is emerging as a power player in the $500 billion online casino market. Boasting more than 7,000 AI-powered games and a rapidly growing sports prediction league, Rollblock has already witnessed a 600% uptick in new registrations. As the project continues to dominate the altcoin market during its presale, analysts are projecting returns of up to 880% for early RBLK adopters. Unlike traditional gaming platforms, Rollblock incorporates both traditional and digital finance. Players can top up their accounts using 20+ compatible cryptocurrencies by connecting their wallets or deposit fiat currency via Google Pay, Apple Pay, or MasterCard. Rollblock is also committed to user security through its Ethereum-backed security system. All wagers are automatically encrypted on-chain, making it impossible to alter bets after they are placed. Rollblock’s smart contract has passed a SolidProof audit, ensuring that there are no secret back doors for hackers to exploit. You might also like: Coinbase files papers to list SOL; experts notice whales’ continued support for Rollblock Rollblock further sets itself apart from the competition with its native RBLK token. Investors can secure rewards of up to 30% APYs by adding RBLK to staking pools. With the revenue-sharing model, Rollblock will use up to 30% of its weekly revenue to make open market buybacks of RBLK and distribute 40% of these to holders as rewards. The remaining 60% will be permanently removed from RBLK’s supply, creating scarcity and putting deflationary pressure on the price. Currently, RBLK is in stage 10 of its presale with tokens selling for $0.055. Since Rollblock’s supply is capped at one billion tokens, analysts expect a massive 100x accumulation rally once RBLK is listed on major exchange platforms. Is Solana facing another correction? Solana’s price has remained volatile throughout 2025 after it reached an all-time high of $294 on January 19. Following the rally, a huge meme coin selloff pushed its price below $200. Although Solana’s price action paints a bearish picture, SOL’s Open Interest has surged to $3.3 billion. This recent spike suggests that increased capital is entering Solana’s contracts, potentially setting the stage for a recovery. Another optimistic metric is Solana’s Sharpe ratio which has recently increased to 0.48, suggesting that returns outweigh the associated risk at current prices. Solana is currently selling at $1678.35 following an intraday decline of 5.90%. The altcoin is still trading below several of its Exponential Moving Averages on the daily chart. With the MACD in a bearish crossover, analysts expect more volatility for Solana in the coming weeks.

After a slow initial rollout approximately four months ago, Bloomberg reports that the platform has sold over 24 billion of its WLFI tokens, representing more than 96% of its total supply. As it stands, fewer than 1 billion tokens remain available for sale. World Liberty Financial Token Sale Sparks Debate The World Liberty Financial token, priced at 5 cents each, is part of a broader initiative aimed at raising $300 million at a $1.5 billion valuation. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Faces Renewed Pressure—Is a Breakdown Imminent? The project launched its token sale in mid-October, with the intention of enabling token holders to propose changes to the platform and vote on others’ proposals. However, the limited rights associated with the WLFI tokens have raised concerns. Holders possess minimal voting rights and no economic entitlements, and the tokens cannot be traded or sold back to World Liberty, prompting questions about their long-term value and utility. Adding to the intrigue surrounding World Liberty Financial, crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun, founder of the TRON blockchain, recently disclosed a substantial investment of $45 million into the venture. This increased Justin Sun’s total stake in World Liberty Financial to $75 million, indicating strong confidence in the platform’s potential. TRUMP And MELANIA Tokens Experience Wild Price Fluctuations Analysts are speculating that forthcoming executive orders from Trump could positively influence the cryptocurrency landscape in the US, yet skepticism remains among industry veterans. Nic Carter, a venture capitalist, expressed concerns regarding the ethical implications of a sitting president engaging in business ventures that may present conflicts of interest. The launch of Trump’s memecoins has also stirred significant controversy. As previously reported by NewsBTC, the Donald Trump memecoin (TRUMP) saw a sharp decline, dropping from a weekend high of $75 to $17. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Bulls in Action—Is a New Upside Run Beginning? Similarly, the Melania Trump memecoin (MELANIA) disrupted the market with increased excitement among crypto investors, with its value fluctuating dramatically from a high of $13.64 to its current trading price of $1.26. Bernstein analysts have characterized this period as a “chaotic crypto era,” suggesting that government involvement with cryptocurrencies could redefine the relationship between leadership and emerging technologies. They argue that the launches of Trump and Melania’s memecoins could signal a potential regulatory shift, positioning digital assets as a direct link to a wider audience. While trading at $17, TRUMP is posting significant losses of 6%, 2% and 70% in the 24 hour, fourteen day and monthly time frames respectively, coupled with a 27% drop in trading volume, according to CoinGecko data.

The company announced on Tuesday that it is raising $2 billion in 0% convertible senior notes to buy more Bitcoin, betting even bigger on the long-term value of its holdings. The debt offering, open only to qualified institutional buyers, includes an option to raise an extra $300 million if demand is high. The notes mature in 2030, won’t pay interest, and won’t increase in value over time, according to Strategy’s announcement. Investors can convert them into cash or shares of Strategy’s stock, depending on what the company decides. The notes are redeemable starting in 2027, but only if Strategy’s stock price surpasses 130% of the conversion price for a set period. If that happens, Strategy can buy back the notes at face value plus any special interest owed, per the announcement . If Strategy faces a fundamental change, such as a major acquisition or restructuring, investors can demand repayment on March 1, 2028. The conversion rate and final terms will be determined at pricing, based on Strategy’s stock performance on the day the deal is finalized. Bitcoin acquisition and debt strategy Strategy has been using debt to buy Bitcoin for years, and this latest one actually follows a pattern: raise cash, buy Bitcoin, and wait for the price to rise. The company plans to use the $2 billion for general corporate expenses, but its real focus is accumulating more Bitcoin. In 2024, Strategy bought 258,320 BTC for $22.07 billion, paying an average of $85,447 per Bitcoin, including fees. The company didn’t sell a single Bitcoin, despite price fluctuations. As of December 31, 2024, Strategy held 447,470 BTC, valued at $23.9 billion. But its outstanding debt hit $7.27 billion, with $35.1 million in annual interest costs. The company posted a net loss for 2024, mostly due to $1.79 billion in Bitcoin impairment losses. If Bitcoin’s market price crashes, Strategy’s ability to meet financial obligations could be at risk. The company warned in a 10-K SEC filing that it “may not be able to regain profitability” if Bitcoin’s fair value continues to drop. Strategy has been dealing with old accounting rules that force companies to write down Bitcoin losses, but never adjust gains unless sold. That changes in January 2025 with new FASB fair-value accounting rules. Gains and losses will now be recorded in net income each quarter, creating massive fluctuations in reported profits. The new rules will immediately apply a $12.75 billion adjustment to Strategy’s retained earnings. But there’s a catch: tax liabilities could surge. The company warned that unrealized Bitcoin gains might trigger the 15% Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. “If we become subject to the CAMT, it could result in a material tax obligation that we would need to satisfy in cash,” Strategy said. The tax applies to companies with over $1 billion in annual adjusted financial income, and unless the law is amended, Strategy could owe huge taxes by 2026. The company also faces tax risks across multiple jurisdictions, with uncertainty around deferred tax assets and liabilities, as selling Bitcoin at higher prices than its cost basis will likely trigger some serious capital gains taxes. Strategy’s debt offering is private—only qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A can participate. The notes won’t be registered with the SEC and can’t be publicly sold without an exemption. Investors interested in the deal must attend a live webinar on February 19, 2025, where the company will go over terms, risks, and expectations. “Access to the Video Webinar and completion of the investor survey does not mean you will receive an allocation in this proposed convertible notes offering,” Strategy clarified today.

40517875,https://crypto.news/?p=14337994,1739921820,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/40517875.jpeg,Google to let users access their Bitcoin wallets via Google accounts,https://crypto.news/google-to-let-users-access-their-bitcoin-wallets-via-google-accounts/,"On Feb. 18, 2025, during Hong Kong Bitcoin Tech Carnival, Google web3 specialist Kyle Song revealed that Google is working to simplify the use of Bitcoin for Google users. According to Song, Google is “exploring ways to lower entry barriers so Web2 users can easily use Bitcoin.” Song said the company has been working on the integration of Bitcoin into its ecosystem for about a year since Bitcoin ETFs were approved by the SEC. Table of Contents Details revealed by Song Is this a huge news? The Bitcoin ETFs’ role Details revealed by Song Judging from what Song said, Google is preparing a really simple in-use solution that will seamlessly integrate cryptocurrencies into the Google ecosystem used by billions of people across the world. He said Bitcoin wallets will be embedded into the web2 interface so that users will be able to log into their BTC wallets using Google accounts. As for crypto payments, Google aims to make them as simple and intuitive as already existing web2 payment solutions. Another focus of the Google team is ensuring the security of their solution. They strive “to address trust issues between on-chain and off-chain systems.” To maintain stable, trustless functioning, Google is going to deploy Zero-Knowledge Proofs or similar encryption technologies. Is this a huge news? Although Song’s speech wasn’t a full-fledged announcement but rather a teaser, the project itself, if it plays out well, can propel Bitcoin’s adoption like nothing before did. Google is used by billions of users, many of whom have Google accounts. The way people perceive Bitcoin and crypto may change drastically if, one day, all of these people find out they have a seamless service within their Google account that allows them to purchase, exchange, or spend Bitcoin. If Bitcoin functionality is integrated with Google Pay, crypto may see an immense circulation boom. As people discover they have an easy and secure way to use crypto legally, they may start to explore new opportunities associated with this new class of assets. However, it’s important to keep in mind that sometimes ambitious plans set by top-tier companies fail, and it’s early to judge whether we are going to see this collaboration between Google and Bitcoin materialize or not. In 2020, two tech giants, Facebook and Telegram, had to withdraw their plans to deploy cryptocurrencies integrated into their services when it seemed that the projects were about to take off. Both companies survived and moved on. Eventually, Telegram started to support third-party crypto wallets in the form of mini-apps and bots. The wallets integrated into the messenger saw substantial traction, however, the service has its limitations and concerns while lacking serious promotion from Telegram itself. Will Google succeed in becoming the first high-profile company to implement crypto in its services seamlessly? The chances are higher as 2025 is way different than 2020, a year when Facebook and Telegram were about to launch their ambitious projects. Facebook Libra and Telegram Gram token projects didn’t come to fruition partly because they were set to launch in 2020 when the political and legislative environment was much more unfriendly towards crypto than now. More than that, crypto ETFs were not a thing in those days, making it even harder to bring crypto into web2 service. According to Gemini Exchange co-founder Cameron Winklevoss, the Facebook Libra killing was a politically motivated act . The Biden era was marked with Operation Choke Point 2.0, which denied banking services to various companies working with cryptocurrency, and the shutdown of Facebook Libra perfectly set the tone for the following years under Biden’s leadership and the Gensler-led SEC.

Ironically, it was Gensler who made it possible when he approved Bitcoin ETFs. The Bitcoin ETFs’ role Bitcoin ETF approval is widely viewed as a bridge connecting the crypto market and traditional investors. Bitcoin ETFs align with a clear legal framework while allowing its holders to benefit from the Bitcoin market value. ETFs helped big corporations to enter the crypto sector without having to deal with regulatory uncertainty. The fact that BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF IBIT became the fastest-growing asset in history proves that it’s approval was a transformational move.

The company recently submitted a proposal to acquire the remaining shares of Adecoagro, a major agribusiness and energy company. Tether Offers to Buy More Shares Tether is offering $12.41 per share, which, if approved, would increase its stake from 19.4% to 51%. This would make Tether the company’s majority owner, giving it control over its operations. This move further solidifies the stablecoin issuer’s expansion strategy beyond digital assets. Last September, the stablecoin issuer acquired a 9.8% stake in Adecoagro , which currently owns 19.4% of the agricultural company. On February 14, Tether offered $12.41 per share to buy the rest. If accepted, this would make Tether the majority owner. Adecoagro’s Board of Directors is carefully reviewing the proposal. On February 16, they brought in legal and financial experts to study the deal’s impact. After a full evaluation, a final decision will be made. Adecoagro’s Role in South American Agriculture and Energy Adecoagro is a major player in South America’s agricultural sector, managing over 210,400 hectares of farmland. The company produces more than 2.8 million tons of agricultural goods, including crops and dairy products. Additionally, it operates several industrial facilities and generates over 1 million megawatt-hours of renewable electricity annually. Thus, Adecoagro is a key food producer and an important contributor to the region’s energy sector. Tether’s interest in non-crypto industries is growing. If this deal goes through, it will give the stablecoin company control over a major agricultural and energy business in South America. This aligns with Tether’s broader strategy of diversifying its investments beyond digital assets. Tether’s Expanding Influence Beyond Stablecoins Tether is no longer just a stablecoin company. In the past year, it has invested in Bitcoin mining , artificial intelligence (AI), and even a football club. With this move into agribusiness, Tether is expanding its reach even further. At the same time, Tether’s flagship product, USDT, remains the largest in the market, with a value of over $140 billion. The company is also working with the government of Guinea to help the country with digital transformation, including using blockchain to support economic growth and innovation. A key part of this project is education. Tether is helping set up digital literacy programs in Guinea, teaching people about blockchain technology. The company also contributes to Guinea’s Innovation City project, which supports research and entrepreneurship.

BNB is currently priced at $646.51, reflecting a 0.33% increase over the past seven days. Despite a market cap decline of 3.26%, it still holds a strong valuation of $92.11 billion, with a 1.49% increase in 24-hour trading volume to $1.97 billion. Binance Coin’s long-term performance remains impressive, considering the staggering increase of over 672,878.62% from its all-time low of $0.09611 in January 2017.

The XRP price fall has raised concerns after Donald Trump’s revised tariff policies caused uncertainty, pushing the asset down 2.36%. Meanwhile, Dogecoin price resistance at $0.2655 continues to hinder its rebound despite multiple breakout attempts. However, BlockDAG (BDAG) is drawing significant attention as its 350% bonus offer nears its end. With $196 million already raised in its presale, BDAG’s price rises with every batch. The upcoming mainnet launch and predictions of a $1 price post-launch have made this bonus an opportunity for buyers aiming to multiply their holdings before BDAG’s next big move. XRP Price Falls as Markets React to New Trade Policies The XRP price fall has worsened after former U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest tariff announcements shook the financial markets. XRP dropped 2.36% in the past 24 hours to $2.43 as traders responded to the 25% tariff on steel imports and additional aluminum levies. The change in trade policies created a risk-off environment, leading market participants to exit speculative assets, including cryptocurrencies. Analysts are watching XRP closely, with $2.25 identified as a critical support level. Should the selling pressure persist, the XRP price fall could intensify, potentially driving it down to $2.00 and adding more market uncertainty. Dogecoin Price Resistance at $0.2655 Blocks Further Gains Dogecoin price resistance remains a key obstacle as the asset tries to recover above $0.250. After briefly dipping to $0.2388, DOGE regained some strength, climbing above a bearish trend line and surpassing the 100-hourly simple moving average. Despite this, strong resistance at $0.260 and $0.2655 is holding back its progress. If DOGE breaks through these levels, it could aim for $0.2725 and possibly reach $0.300 in the near term. However, failing to overcome the Dogecoin price resistance could result in a drop toward $0.2520 or even $0.2380, keeping traders cautious. BlockDAG’s 350% Bonus Ends Soon—A Limited Window to Expand Holdings BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700 bonus is in its last phase, giving buyers a limited-time chance to secure a 350% BDAG bonus before prices climb higher. For instance, a $5,000 purchase now delivers an extra $17,500 worth of BDAG, offering a rare chance to grow holdings instantly. With each presale batch increasing the price, this timing has become crucial. The presale has already raised $196 million, selling over 18.5 billion BDAG coins, showing strong market confidence. Since its launch, BDAG’s price has surged 2380% from $0.001 to $0.0248, making it one of the fastest-growing projects in the market. Each presale round is selling out faster than the previous one, and BDAG is expected to hit its $600 million target soon. Analysts consider BDAG one of the top crypto picks, with early buyers positioning for potentially significant long-term returns. BDAG’s real turning point will be its 2025 mainnet launch. Once live, the network’s utility will expand, driving up demand and strengthening its long-term prospects. Analysts are already predicting a $1 price for BDAG post-launch, highlighting the strong growth potential. As the ecosystem grows, BDAG’s value becomes clearer, and early accumulation is likely to pay off well. The project’s path toward wider adoption makes it one of the top crypto picks, with a promising future once the blockchain is fully operational. Final Say! As market dynamics shift, each of these assets faces a pivotal phase. XRP price fall remains a concern as new trade policies increase volatility, prompting traders to monitor key support levels. Dogecoin price resistance at $0.2655 continues to block its recovery, with a breakout being crucial for further gains. On the other hand, BlockDAG stands out as its 350% bonus offer is nearing its final stage. With $196 million raised and a 2380% price surge since batch 1, BDAG’s momentum is undeniable. A 2025 mainnet launch and a $1 price prediction put it among the top crypto picks of today.

In contrast, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is emerging as a game-changer, offering a smarter, AI-driven alternative with real utility. Analysts predict a 400% surge in the next three days, making it one of the most promising investment opportunities in the market. While the Shiba Inu price continues to battle whale sell-outs, WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents a more stable and profitable path, thanks to its ongoing presale, where tokens are currently priced at $0.0420 . With a price increase imminent and its official launch approaching, this project is positioned to outshine the Shiba Inu price, offering investors the chance to capitalize on its early-stage growth before it takes off. Whale Movements Continue To Squeeze Shiba Inu Price Currently priced at $0.000016, the Shiba Inu price has managed a slight recovery after massive whale transfers, climbing 1.3% in the last 24 hours and 3.4% over the past week. However, a closer look at the Shiba Inu price’s 30-day performance, which dropped 23.8%, paints a different picture. These fluctuations happen because whales accumulate when the Shiba Inu price is low and dump their holdings at higher levels, leaving retail investors to bear the brunt of the impact. As these investors seek more stable investments without whales’ influence, a new player is capturing their attention: WallitIQ (WLTQ). This project offers an alternative that combines AI-driven crypto management, near-zero transaction fees , and lucrative staking rewards (up to 180% APY ). Unlike the Shiba Inu price, which relies heavily on meme culture and community speculation, this altcoin positions itself as a utility-based token with tangible benefits. Here’s Why Analysts Say WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Surge By 400% In Three Days While the Shiba Inu price remains in a loop due to whale activities, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is gaining massive traction. Its presale is selling out rapidly as investors rush to secure their tokens at $0.0420 . The next presale stage will increase the price to $0.0620, and top exchange listings are on the way. Based on these developments, this project could see a 400% surge in value in the next few days. Beyond its booming presale , WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) well-structured tokenomics and real-world use cases give it a competitive edge over traditional cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu. With 45% of its supply allocated to public sales, 20% reserved for referral, airdrops and other community bonuses , and 15% dedicated to exchange liquidity, the project is designed for sustainable long-term growth. Unlike speculative meme coins, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is designed for utility-driven adoption. It allows users to pay for their everyday goods using crypto. Through its MVP build, this platform offers users access to AI-powered market insights and several sophisticated trading tools for smarter trading decisions, equipping them with all they need to maximize their profit potential. While the cryptocurrency space remains vulnerable to hacks and malicious smart contracts, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has undergone extensive audits by SolidProof, guaranteeing its reliability and integrity. With other security features such as biometric authentication, AI-driven anomaly detection, and AES & ECC encryption protocols, it further solidifies its reputation as a safe investment. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) platform empowers both retail and whale investors to take advantage of the volatile market. With exchange listings imminent, the WLTQ token price is expected to surpass its presale valuation. Analysts believe that once the upcoming beta platform goes live and early adopters begin testing the platform’s advanced features, demand will skyrocket, fueling a price rally of up to 400% within three days. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale Closing Soon: Last Chance Before The 400% Surge While Shiba Inu price continues to experience unpredictable price swings due to whale activity, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is proving to be a far more strategic investment. Its AI-powered wallet, low fees, and strong security features set it apart from traditional meme coins, making it a smart choice for investors seeking sustainable growth. With a presale selling out rapidly and a beta platform launch set to introduce groundbreaking crypto management tools, WLTQ is well-positioned for a significant 400% price explosion. By purchasing the WLTQ tokens at the current price of $0.0420 , those who get in now stand to gain the most.

In just 24 hours, an additional 400 investors joined the project, highlighting the strong demand for this emerging DeFi token. As the first presale phase nears its conclusion, investors are securing their tokens at $0.01, anticipating a 100% price increase in Phase Two. With its decentralized lending model, Mutuum Finance offers a unique opportunity for users to generate passive income while providing access to liquidity. The combination of strong market interest, structured tokenomics, and an upcoming platform launch has positioned MUTM as a high-potential investment in 2025. What Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance is a fully decentralized lending and borrowing protocol, designed to eliminate middlemen and put financial control back in the hands of users. Operating on smart contracts, the platform enables secure, automated lending and borrowing, allowing investors to maximize their crypto assets. The platform introduces two distinct lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Investors deposit assets into liquidity pools and receive mtTokens (such as mtETH or mtDAI), which accrue interest over time. This model ensures stable liquidity for borrowers while allowing lenders to earn passive income. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Users negotiate lending terms directly, unlocking borrowing options for tokens not supported in liquidity pools, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) or Pepe (PEPE) . This flexibility allows traders to access funds without selling their holdings. With a transparent and efficient approach, Mutuum Finance is addressing the growing demand for decentralized financial services. Why Investors Are Rushing to Mutuum Finance 1. Explosive Presale Growth Mutuum Finance has witnessed an exceptional presale performance, raising over $730,000 and attracting 400 new investors within 24 hours. With only a limited number of tokens available in Phase One, FOMO is growing as more investors rush to secure their position before the price moves up. 2. Passive Income with mtTokens Unlike speculative tokens, Mutuum Finance offers sustainable earning opportunities. By supplying assets to liquidity pools, investors receive mtTokens, which automatically accrue interest. For example, an investor who supplies $5,000 USDT at a 9% APY would earn an additional $450 in passive income over a year, without selling their initial investment. 3. Buy-and-Distribute Mechanism To create sustained demand, Mutuum Finance has implemented a buy-and-distribute mechanism. A share of the platform’s fees is allocated to buying back MUTM tokens, which are subsequently distributed to mtToken stakers. This process continuously drives demand, supporting price stability and benefiting long-term holders. Mutuum Finance is rapidly approaching its second presale phase, where the token price will increase from $0.01 to $0.015. Looking further ahead, by launch, MUTM is set to reach $0.06, representing a 600% surge. However, analysts suggest the price will go even higher, hitting $0.23 post-launch, marking a 2,300% increase. For instance, an investor purchasing 210,000 MUTM at $0.01 for $2,100 will see their holdings grow to $48,300 when the price reaches $0.23, showcasing the strong upside potential of early investment. With over 1,200 holders and $730K raised, Mutuum Finance is quickly proving to be one of the strongest DeFi contenders of 2025. Its decentralized lending platform, passive income opportunities, and innovative tokenomics have fueled growing investor interest. As Phase One nears completion, those looking to enter at the lowest possible price have limited time before the next price increase to $0.015.

40519444,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=699120,1739925027,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Bitcoin To $500,000: Standard Chartered Doubles Down On 2028 Target",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-500000-standard-chartered-2028-target/,"Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research, Geoffrey Kendrick, has reaffirmed his standout price forecast for Bitcoin. Kendrick, who envisions BTC hitting $500,000 by 2028, bases his conviction on evidence of increasing institutional involvement — specifically pointing to sovereign wealth funds, state pension funds, and other large-scale investors. Sovereign Wealth Funds Enter The Bitcoin Fray According to a new report from Standard Chartered cited by The Block, Kendrick sees growing signs that government-backed investment vehicles are ramping up their interest in Bitcoin. This view is reinforced by Abu Dhabi’s recent disclosure of a 4,700 BTC-equivalent position in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) via its sovereign wealth fund. Related Reading: Bitcoin Presents A ‘Generational Opportunity’ As Global Turmoil Intensifies, Says Bitwise Executive “While this is small for now, we would expect the size to increase over time and, indeed, for other sovereigns to also start buying,” Kendrick wrote in the Tuesday report. He explained that Abu Dhabi’s move marks a strategic shift and could presage broader participation from other wealth funds looking to diversify their portfolios with BTC. Kendrick’s confidence is partly rooted in Form 13F filings — quarterly reports that institutional managers overseeing at least $100 million in assets are required to file with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Reviewing data from the fourth quarter of 2024, Kendrick noted a compelling trend. “The 13F filings for Q4 show that process is underway…It is happening,” he said in an email to The Block. In Standard Chartered’s analysis, Q4 data revealed that while hedge funds maintained their lead in Bitcoin purchases, banks — which began buying in Q3 of last year — also ramped up their positions. Kendrick drew parallels between an earlier stage in Bitcoin’s market evolution, dominated by retail investors, and the more recent era, which saw hedge funds jump aboard through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Now, the spotlight appears to be broadening further to include state investment managers and central banks. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Big Breakout? Fed’s “Not QE, QE” Just Flipped The Switch “This gives us comfort to say that even if buying by Strategy… [formerly MicroStrategy] slows down dramatically (it has bought a staggering 227k BTC since the US election, more than 1% of the ever-to-exist supply), we think other buyers are waiting to step in,” Kendrick noted. The mention of MicroStrategy underscores just how significant one private company’s bitcoin holdings can be. Yet Standard Chartered’s analysis suggests that other large, patient pools of capital might absorb future supply, thus supporting higher prices over the long term. Among the institutions, Kendrick highlights the State of Wisconsin Investment Board and the State of Michigan Department of the Treasury. However, he also points to central banks as potential new participants. In the report, Kendrick references the Czech National Bank, which has considered allocating up to 5% of its €140 billion in reserves into bitcoin, and notes that the Swiss National Bank is in the early stages of contemplating a similar move. These developments could further bolster bitcoin’s legitimacy as a store of value on par with more traditional asset classes. “As institutional access to bitcoin improves and volatility declines, we expect more portfolios to migrate towards their optimal level from an underweight Bitcoin starting point,” Kendrick concluded. At press time, BTC traded at $95,581.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Pentoshi tells his 855,900 followers on the social media platform X that the OTHERS weekly chart, which tracks the total market cap of crypto excluding the 10 largest digital assets and stablecoins, is flashing bullish. “Liking [last weekly candle]… [This] week higher for your favorite cryptocurrency coins in my opinion.” Source: Pentoshi/X He believes that the OTHERS chart may soon have a series of rallies and flip the $281 billion resistance level on the weekly chart into support. “These are going to likely be the most decisive spots in terms of trends, entries and exits for the foreseeable future. $250 billion is where we took longs and is very close to an HTF (high time frame) invalidation level which makes it cheap if wrong. $281 billion is our local resistance, but we want to see it end up towards $320 billion-ish. Again, we could chop here. $320 billion is a great partial exit point and if it flips it can get back in etc. Which makes it also cheap if wrong, since you don’t have to pay much for confirmation of further upside at that point.” Source: Pentoshi/X The OTHERS is trading at $271.46 billion at time of writing. Looking at Bitcoin, Pentoshi says that BTC looks strong despite an onslaught of bearish news. “It’s crazy. All that’s taken place in the last few months, and this is what BTC looks like.” Source: Pentoshi/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $96,228. Earlier this month, Pentoshi predicted that the crypto market cap may hit a valuation of $4.42 trillion as soon as the first quarter of this year. “Probably this quarter.” Source: Pentoshi/X At time of writing, the total market cap of crypto stands at $3.134 trillion.

Polkadot and HBAR are making headlines with major advancements. Polkadot is improving its blockchain by enhancing scalability and cross-chain communication, securing its role as a crucial Polkadot crypto in the blockchain sector. At the same time, HBAR is seeing price growth fueled by strategic alliances and tech upgrades, showing strong potential. But there’s more to watch. Web3Bay is entering the e-commerce sector with a fresh approach, removing middlemen and making transactions more direct. This change doesn’t just cut fees—it transforms how buyers and sellers connect. With its blockchain use, Web3Bay is emerging as a key player for those looking at practical crypto applications. Could this be the start of decentralized platforms that are challenging big names like Amazon and eBay? Web3Bay: Pioneering the Online Shopping Web3Bay is shifting the traditional e-commerce structure that companies like Amazon and eBay dominate. By cutting out unnecessary intermediaries, it allows buyers and sellers to interact directly. This setup reduces extra costs, meaning consumers pay less while sellers earn more. As e-commerce continues growing, Web3Bay’s model could reshape online shopping, making it fairer and more efficient. Web3Bay’s presale of its native coin, 3BAY, is gaining attention, making it one of the most talked-about blockchain projects. With an affordable entry price, 3BAY presents a chance for those wanting to be part of a project aiming for long-term growth. The presale has already exceeded $1.4 million, reflecting strong confidence in Web3Bay’s approach to blockchain-powered e-commerce. As Polkadot and HBAR continue advancing in the crypto market, Web3Bay stands out for applying blockchain in a real-world sector worth trillions. Its push for decentralized commerce could mark a major step in how online businesses operate. With an ongoing presale and plans to disrupt e-commerce, Web3Bay is drawing interest from both blockchain supporters and e-commerce enthusiasts alike. Polkadot Crypto: Expanding Blockchain’s Reach Polkadot isn’t just another blockchain—it’s a multi-chain system creating new possibilities for blockchain interaction. By enabling secure cross-chain transfers of data and digital assets, Polkadot connects different blockchain networks under a single security system. This function makes it a vital part of the future of decentralized applications. With constant updates and an expanding ecosystem, Polkadot crypto is an attractive choice for developers building the next generation of blockchain applications. Its ability to link public and private chains, permissioned and permissionless networks, and even upcoming technologies put it at the forefront of blockchain evolution. Instead of following trends, Polkadot is actively shaping the future of blockchain interoperability. HBAR’s Price Surge: A Growing Force in Crypto HBAR, the digital currency of Hedera Hashgraph, is gaining attention due to its rising value and technological improvements. Using its unique hashgraph consensus method, HBAR provides better speed, security, and scalability compared to standard blockchain setups. These features make it a strong competitor in the cryptocurrency sector. Recent strategic moves and key partnerships have further reinforced HBAR’s role in the market. With more institutions getting involved and increased funding in its ecosystem, HBAR isn’t just benefiting from market trends—it’s creating its own path. These advancements signal a bright future, placing HBAR among the standout names in the crypto industry. Final Thoughts Polkadot crypto and HBAR’s price surge highlight key advancements shaping blockchain’s future. Polkadot continues to lead in making blockchains work together seamlessly, making it a preferred choice for developers. Similarly, HBAR’s improvements in transaction efficiency and security are positioning it as a major competitor. Amidst these developments, Web3Bay is taking its place in the e-commerce sector . By using blockchain to remove middlemen, it lowers costs for buyers while boosting seller profits. This approach challenges traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay, making Web3Bay an interesting choice for those looking at blockchain applications beyond trading. As blockchain technology continues advancing, these projects present exciting opportunities for those keeping an eye on the market.

Texas, the Bitcoin capital of the US, is home to many digital asset companies seeking to leverage the state’s deregulated electricity market, renewable energy resources, and favorable regulatory environment. Several prominent industry leaders have established operations in Texas, including Bitmain and Great American Mining (acquired by Crusoe Energy) have set up operations in the Lone Star state. The company previously established a 200MW data center in Garden City, Texas, which draws its power from an adjacent wind farm. MARA Holdings’ Texas wind farm acquisition The newly acquired wind farm offers 240 megawatts (MW) of interconnection capacity and 114 MW of nameplate wind capacity. MARA Holdings intends to repurpose last-generation ASIC mining hardware that would otherwise have been discarded at this facility. The company will also be utilizing 100% renewable energy to power these machines, so the center will be run at zero marginal cost. This sustainable approach not only extends the operational life of existing equipment but also reduces Bitcoin production costs through vertical integration. Fred Thiel, MARA’s chairman and CEO, stated , “The closing of this acquisition represents a significant milestone in MARA’s ongoing transformation as we expand our asset base, following our strategic shift from an asset-light to an asset-heavy business model.” With this move, the company is a step closer to achieving near net-zero operating costs. The sustainable mining movement is gaining steam MARA Holdings’ sustainable approach to cryptocurrency mining is in line with the recent trend of addressing environmental concerns and energy consumption challenges with renewable energy. Cryptocurrency mining is an energy-intensive activity and many crypto mining companies are actively working to reduce energy costs while increasing their mining capacity. Countries like Russia and Iran have faced energy challenges due to crypto mining, resulting in blackouts and power shortages. Rather than invest in a renewable power source, these countries instead imposed restrictions and crackdowns on cryptocurrency mining. Companies like HIVE Digital Technologies and Iris Energy are taking the sustainability route. HIVE Digital Technologies intends to target 2% of the global Bitcoin mining capacity. The company plans to achieve this by expanding its operations to 15 EH/s by the end of 2025 via hydroelectric power. MARA Holdings has several data centers running on renewable energy. The company now has two centers in Texas including the new wind farm, two in Ohio and one in Finland. The data centers have a capacity of about 438 MW between them and function with different energy sources, including wind and heat. When the planned expansions and developments are completed that number will rise to 688 MW. The company’s sixth data center in Findlay, Ohio is still in development and is expected to be fully functional by the end of 2025.

It touched an intraday peak of 6,129.63 earlier, pushing its year-to-date gains to 4.5%, according to data from Google Finance. Investors keep piling in, even as inflation worries and President Donald Trump’s trade policies hang over the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average barely moved though, adding 10 points, or 0.02%, to land at 44,556.34, and the Nasdaq Composite managed to close at 20,041.26, gaining 0.07%, per Google Finance data. Stock futures didn’t do much overnight, with S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures edging up less than 0.01%, while Dow futures added 18 points, or 0.04%, according to data from CNBC. Meta drops as earnings shake up after-hours trading Not every stock had a winning day. Shares of the Facebook and Instagram parent ended the day 2.76% lower at $716.37 a share. The stock is up 22.35% this year, making it the winning name of the ‘Magnificent 7’ group of U.S. megacap technology companies. Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler, said in a note that the market is staying strong despite negative sentiment. “The stock market’s resiliency has been impressive year-to-date as investors refuse to ‘back down’ in the face of rising negative sentiment and concerns about tariff and inflation headlines,” he said. The stock market has actually been on a wild run for two years. The S&P 500 gained 23% in 2024 and 24% in 2023. With dividends, those numbers jump to 25% and 26%, but JPMorgan analysts say a repeat in 2025 not likely. Since 1928, this kind of winning streak has only happened once—during the late 1990s tech boom. Historically, the US stock market averages 10% annual returns, according to data from Dimensional. Adjusted for inflation, that drops to 6.5%-7%, a trend that McKinsey data tracks back to 1800. Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, said investors have been spoiled by back-to-back 20% years. Scott Wren, a senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, doesn’t see another 20%+ gain happening. “Do we expect an S&P 500 Index three-peat in 2025? In short, no,” he wrote in a Wednesday market note.

So, we have institutions and banks of all sizes supervised by the Fed that are engaged in crypto-related activities, either themselves directly or supporting clients who do crypto work. Our expectation is they do that in a safe and sound way. Michael Barr The Vice-Chair also highlighted that the Federal Reserve has a supervision program for institutions dealing with digital assets. Some banks managed this sector well, while others encountered liquidity issues or compliance issues that caused their downfall. According to Barr’s remarks on risk management in the banking sector, it is worth pursuing if you do it correctly and effectively; if you do not do it properly, then it’s best to avoid it. Barr’s surprise exit clears path for Trump to reshape Fed leadership Barr announced last month that he will step down on Feb. 28, in a surprise move that will avert a potentially messy legal fight with President-elect Donald Trump, who is now free to replace him with an official of his choosing. Barr said he was stepping down as the central bank’s vice chair for supervision over a year before his term was set to expire in July 2026 but planned to keep his seat on the Fed’s Board of Governors. His term on the board is set to last until 2032. Barr initially told Congress in November that he intended to serve out his term, but since then, he has concluded that doing so could risk a potentially harmful dispute with the Trump administration, which the Washington Post reported in October has considered demoting Barr from his regulatory post. Barr’s exit adds uncertainty to the fate of US regulators’ proposal requiring major lenders to hold more capital to safeguard against losses and financial crises. The KBW Bank Index climbed as much as 2.4% to the highest intraday since Dec. 16, after the Fed announced that Barr would step down from the position. Barr has played a crucial role in negotiations for the proposal, which intends to prevent future bank failures and a financial crisis. The financial industry has lobbied aggressively against the new requirements, which as of now call for a 19% capital increase for the largest US banks, such as Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. In September, he previewed proposed changes that would lower that increase to 9%. Those revisions drew opposition from at least three out of five directors at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Barr’s recent remarks reflect ongoing tensions between regulators and the banking industry over digital assets and financial inclusion.

With new projects launching every day, the crypto space is buzzing with opportunities. But not all meme coins are created equal—some bring real innovation, while others ride the hype train. In the past week, Andy announced a major partnership set to reshape its ecosystem, while Cat in a Dog’s World made waves with a record-breaking presale milestone. But the real showstopper? Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) —a meme coin redefining presales with its unique “traveling” approach and aggressive token burn strategy. This article dives into the latest updates on Arctic Pablo Coin, Andy, and Cat in a Dog’s World. Let’s explore why these three are among the Best New Meme Coins for Massive Return Potential this year. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Power | Best New Meme Coins for Massive Return Potential One of the standout features of Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is its revolutionary token burn mechanism. Unlike other projects that schedule occasional burns, APC systematically removes unsold tokens every week during the presale. And that’s not all—any remaining tokens post-presale will also be permanently burned, creating a deflationary effect that drives scarcity and enhances long-term value. With all burns being publicly recorded on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), investors can track every transaction, ensuring transparency and trust. Presale Structure – A Journey Across Locations Rather than traditional presale stages, Arctic Pablo Coin takes a unique travel-inspired approach. Instead of fixed phases, APC “travels” through different icy locations, marking new milestones with each presale price increase. Current Presale Price: $0.000063 Current Location: Blizzard Bay Total Raised: Over $1.41 Million Launch Price: $0.008 ROI Potential: Over 12,618.77% from current phase to launch Staking and Rewards APY: 66% during presale—stake and earn rewards. Referral Incentives: Spread the word and get rewarded. Community Competitions: Win APC tokens and USD. With such a dynamic structure and an aggressive burn strategy, Arctic Pablo Coin is shaping up as one of the Best New Meme Coins for Massive Return Potential in 2024. The Arctic Adventure Continues – Limited-Time Entry at Frostburg The Arctic Pablo Coin presale has been a whirlwind, with locations selling out in record time. The expedition has already conquered nine locations in under a month, and now, the coin is making waves in Frostburg with an entry price of just $0.000059. With every new stop, the presale price climbs—meaning early investors secure the best possible returns. Arctic Pablo’s 11th phase, Aqua Frost, is already attracting a surge of buyers, pushing the total raise beyond $1.41 million. Miss this phase, and the price only gets higher. With an ROI potential exceeding 12,618.77%, those who secure APC now stand to gain the most. Don’t wait—this Arctic journey is moving fast! Andy Expands Its Ecosystem with New Partnership The meme coin Andy has announced a game-changing partnership with a top-tier blockchain infrastructure provider. This collaboration aims to enhance Andy’s utility and ecosystem, introducing new staking opportunities and DeFi integrations. The market has responded positively, with Andy’s trading volume spiking 45% in 24 hours. As the project continues to evolve, investors are keeping a close eye on its next moves. Cat in a Dog’s World Hits Presale Record Cat in a Dog’s World is turning heads with its explosive presale success. The project has now raised over $3.2 million, shattering previous meme coin presale records. This surge in interest comes after the announcement of a major NFT integration, allowing token holders to access exclusive in-game assets. With growing community hype and a rapidly expanding user base, Cat in a Dog’s World is proving to be a serious contender in the meme coin space. Final Thoughts – Which Meme Coin Will Dominate? Each of these projects is making waves in its own way, but Arctic Pablo Coin stands out with its innovative presale structure, deflationary tokenomics, and explosive ROI potential. While Andy’s new partnership and Cat in a Dog’s World’s presale records add to the excitement, Arctic Pablo Coin’s strategic token burns and limited-time low entry price make it a prime candidate for massive gains. With presale locations selling out fast, now is the time to secure APC before it moves to its next price hike!

Worldcoin is capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts in equal measure. In the first week of May, Worldcoin’s token, WLD, saw a dramatic rise in its value, positioning it as one of the top-performing altcoins in the market. This surge coincides with heightened activity around artificial intelligence (AI) advancements, particularly those involving OpenAI, hinting at a significant correlation between WLD’s market movements and developments in AI technology. The buzz is partly attributed to speculative reports about potential collaborations and new ventures that could integrate more AI tools into cryptocurrency.

RSI is near oversold; MACD hints at a possible bullish crossover. Key levels to watch are the resistance at $1.20 and support at $1.10 for short-term moves. Worldcoin price analysis on February 18th shows WLD has been under persistent selling pressure since mid-December 2024, leading to a sharp decline of over 56%. The downturn has erased all the gains from its November bull run, leaving traders uncertain about the asset’s future movement. Despite the ongoing downtrend, there are signs of a potential recovery. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted that WLD is flashing multiple buy signals on the weekly timeframe using the TD Sequential indicator. This suggests that the bearish momentum might weaken, hinting at a possible price reversal. Martinez’s analysis indicates that WLD’s buy signals have appeared around the $1.286 mark, a potential entry point for traders looking to capitalize on a rebound. However, as of today, WLD’s price is $1.14, reflecting a 4.64% decline over the past 24 hours. WLD daily chart analysis: Potential reversal in sight Worldcoin’s daily chart exhibits a prolonged downtrend with the price hovering around $1.13. The asset remains below key resistance levels, indicating weak bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 30.85, approaching oversold territory. This suggests that selling pressure could be nearing exhaustion, increasing the probability of a short-term bounce. WLD daily chart analysis: Potential reversal in sight The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator remains in negative territory, with the MACD line at -0.1846 and the signal line at -0.2022. However, a potential bullish crossover is forming, which could indicate a shift in momentum. If the price stabilizes and breaks above immediate resistance at $1.20, an upward movement toward $1.286 could materialize. Conversely, failure to hold current support levels could drive WLD lower toward $1.05. WLD 4-hour chart analysis: Short-term support holding The 4-hour chart shows WLD consolidating near $1.132 after a recent decline. The RSI stands at 36.66, suggesting the asset is still under selling pressure but gradually approaching oversold conditions. If the RSI crosses above 40, it could indicate a strengthening bullish momentum. WLD 4-hour chart analysis: Short-term support holding The Bollinger Bands have widened, reflecting increased volatility. An increase in buying volume could push the price toward the $1.18-$1.20 resistance zone. On the downside, failure to hold current levels could lead to a retest of the $1.10 support level. WLD’s technical indicators suggest that while the asset is still in a bearish phase, early signs of a potential reversal are emerging. Traders should closely watch resistance at $1.20 and support at $1.10 for further price action confirmation.

Authorities determined that the financial incentives tied to the program could unduly influence participants’ decisions, raising significant ethical concerns. The suspension of Worldcoin’s operations in Brazil took effect the following day, January 25. Is Worldcoin a good investment? Investing in Worldcoin offers the opportunity to be part of a cryptocurrency project that leverages biometric verification and zero-knowledge proofs to enhance asset security and privacy. Its approach prevents impersonation and supports Universal Basic Income (UBI) distribution, potentially reducing economic inequality. The upcoming World Chain Layer 2 platform, backed by Ethereum’s security, promises efficient user onboarding and robust blockchain operations. These advancements position Worldcoin as a forward-thinking investment in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Will Worldcoin recover? The current WLD’s price action shows volatility and a slight recovery, suggesting that the cryptocurrency may have the potential for recovery. However, future performance will depend on the crypto market conditions and investor sentiment. Will Worldcoin reach $5? According to long-term predictions, the Worldcoin price forecast expects WLD to reach $5 by 2028. Will Worldcoin reach $100? Worldcoin prediction to reach $100 is highly unlikely due to current market conditions, its present price levels, and the significant rise in market capitalization required. Such an increase would necessitate extraordinary growth and adoption. Does Worldcoin have an excellent long-term future? WLD coin is showing some recovery trend; the token may have a promising long-term future. Continued development, adoption, and favorable market trends will be crucial for its success. Worldcoin recent news Worldcoin’s ecosystem continues to expand, with its World ID system now active in over 80 countries, with plans to increase that number to 120. The project has also launched biometric scanning devices, known as Orbs, in various global cities, including Berlin, Dubai, London, and New York City. These developments contribute to its long-term adoption and credibility. Sam Altman’s AI-driven cryptocurrency startup, World, is reportedly finalizing a lease for approximately 60,000 square feet at Mission Rock’s Building B in San Francisco, marking its latest expansion near OpenAI’s growing presence in the city’s waterfront district.

Potentially entering a new price discovery phase for the first time in seven years, analysts suggest a possible surge to new record highs. Bullish Targets For XRP Price In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), technical analyst Dark Defender indicated that the XRP price consolidation has concluded, as evidenced by the lows in the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Gearing Up for Gains—Can Bulls Sustain The Momentum? The analyst posits that a “wave 3” rally may be set to launch, targeting a price of $5.85, which would represent an impressive 129% increase from its XRP’s current trading level of $2.55. Further reinforcing his bullish outlook, Dark Defender identified another ambitious target for XRP, suggesting it could nearly triple its previous all-time high of $3.40, aiming for a new target of $8.76, which implies a potential 243% uptrend from current levels. In addition, Dark Defender pointed to key support levels for the XRP price in the short-term, currently established at $1.88 and $2.33. The latter has proven to be a critical threshold, preventing further declines amid a turbulent market characterized by broader cryptocurrency sell-offs. On the upside, however, the XRP price may face major resistance at the $2.66 and $3.12 levels, which previously served as support before the extension of the recent downtrend for the altcoin. Should the XRP price manage to break free from its current consolidation phase and reclaim the $3 mark, additional resistance could emerge at $3.29 and $3.38, levels that previously thwarted attempts to surpass the $3.40 record. SEC Acknowledges Grayscale’s XRP ETF Filing A significant legal development in the US could serve as a catalyst for these anticipated price movements. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently acknowledged Grayscale’s filing for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF), signaling potential advancements toward the approval of such investment vehicles. This development follows a shift in the SEC’s leadership, with the departure of Gary Gensler, who oversaw the lawsuit against Ripple Labs—an action that stifled XRP’s price for nearly four years, confining it to a narrow trading range of $0.30 to $0.50. Related Reading: Bitcoin Unable To Break Upward As 1.6 Million BTC Resistance Wall Blocks Path The current administration under President Donald Trump is seen as adopting a different approach to regulatory oversight compared to the previous Biden administration. The new SEC leadership may promote a more favorable environment for cryptocurrencies beyond the approvals of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year, which have significantly increased their adoption and attracted capital inflows.

His role includes managing a workforce of approximately 50,000 employees while implementing the administration’s trade policies. Lutnick is expected to work alongside Jamieson Greer, Trump’s nominee for trade negotiator, to enforce tariff policies aimed at reshaping US trade relationships. He has voiced support for imposing tariffs on a country-by-country basis, arguing that they will encourage foreign governments to lower trade barriers for American goods.

With its decentralized lending platform, structured presale, and real-world utility, this project is drawing significant attention from early investors. Analysts predict that its value could surge by 4000%, making it a compelling option for those seeking long-term gains. As the presale advances, more investors are securing their positions before the price climbs in the next phase. With a strong foundation, growing community, and a roadmap designed for sustainable growth, Mutuum Finance will be a standout investment in the evolving DeFi world. Here are three key reasons why this token deserves a spot in your portfolio. Three Reasons to Invest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a high-potential DeFi project, gaining traction among investors looking for long-term growth. With its decentralized lending model, structured tokenomics, and upcoming exchange listings, experts believe it will experience a 4000% surge. Here’s why this token deserves a spot in your portfolio. 1. Real-World Utility with Lending and Stablecoin Integration Unlike many speculative tokens, MUTM powers a decentralized lending and borrowing platform, offering real financial utility. Users can supply crypto assets to liquidity pools, earning passive income while borrowers access funds by providing collateral. Additionally, the team is developing an overcollateralized stablecoin, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar on Ethereum’s blockchain, ensuring liquidity and stability. These features make MUTM a functional asset, not just another presale token. 2. Early Investment Advantage Before Price Surge Mutuum Finance is still in its presale phase, offering the lowest possible entry price before it moves to exchanges. Currently priced at $0.01, the token is set to rise to $0.015 in Phase 2, creating a limited-time opportunity for early buyers. With over 68 million tokens already sold in a short period, demand is rising, and analysts expect the presale to sell out quickly before its exchange listing. 3. Potential 4000% Surge and High Growth Expectations Experts predict that MUTM will skyrocket 4000% in value, driven by its growing demand, strong DeFi adoption, and upcoming exchange listings. For instance, if an investor buys $500 worth of MUTM at $0.01, their holdings will be worth $20,500 at a 4000% increase. Similarly, $1,000 invested today will turn into $41,000, making this a high-return opportunity for early inventors. Why Mutuum Finance Stands Out Beyond its presale success, Mutuum Finance is built for long-term sustainability. Unlike centralized lending platforms, it operates fully on smart contracts, ensuring transparency and eliminating third-party control. Its strategic tokenomics include allocations for liquidity incentives, ecosystem growth, and lending rewards, creating a strong foundation for continued price appreciation. Additionally, Mutuum’s buy-and-distribute mechanism enhances long-term value. A portion of fees collected on the platform is used to repurchase MUTM tokens, which are then distributed to mtToken stakers, rewarding those who actively engage with the ecosystem. With a fast-growing community, upcoming beta launch, and rising investor interest, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a leading DeFi contender. As decentralized finance adoption expands, tokens like MUTM that provide real-world solutions are expected to perform exceptionally well in the next bull market.

While previous cycles saw assets like Cardano (ADA) and XRP delivering staggering gains, emerging technologies are now setting the stage for the next bull run. Crypto AI algorithms have been scanning the market, identifying hidden gems with the highest growth potential. One name that continues to surface is RCO Finance (RCOF) , an upcoming best altcoin to buy for the 2025 bull run, poised to disrupt the market and deliver exponential gains. RCO Finance (RCOF): The Top Crypto AI Features Crypto AI algorithms are no longer just tools for market speculation; they have become essential instruments in identifying undervalued assets with real-world utility. RCO Finance has been singled out as a frontrunner for the best altcoin to invest in ahead of the 2025 bull run. Unlike speculative memecoins, RCOF integrates artificial intelligence into decentralized finance (DeFi), bridging traditional finance (TradFi) with the future of digital assets. RCO Finance’s ecosystem is built around its crypto AI Robo Advisor, which analyzes live market data from sources like Bloomberg and Reuters. This innovative tool assists investors in making informed decisions by pinpointing optimal market entry and exit points, mitigating risks, and maximizing returns. RCOF uses predictive analytics and automated trading strategies to help users stay ahead of market trends. For example, when the Test (TST) token recently surged and dropped while listed on Binance, RCO Finance’s robo-advisor could have identified optimal entry and exit points, allowing investors to secure profits before the downturn. Beyond its crypto AI insights, RCO Finance offers an unmatched variety of investment options. With access to over 120,000 assets across 12,500 asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, tokenized real-world assets, stocks, ETFs, bonds, and real estate, investors can construct diverse and resilient portfolios. One of RCO Finance’s defining features is its non-KYC framework, allowing users to engage with the platform while maintaining complete privacy. RCOF eliminates traditional barriers, enabling seamless onboarding. The smart contract audits conducted by SolidProof further ensure the security and transparency of the platform. RCO Finance is not just about passive investing, it is designed to empower active traders. The platform incorporates a crypto AI Automated Market Making (AMM) and liquidity pools, allowing users to stake assets, provide liquidity, and earn substantial rewards. For high-risk, high-reward traders, RCOF offers leverage options of up to 1000x on selected assets. This unique feature enables users to amplify gains while maintaining control over their trading strategies. Moreover, as the holders of the best altcoin to buy, investors receive exclusive discounts on trading fees, incentivizing long-term participation in the ecosystem. RCO Finance has already captured widespread investor interest. Following the platform’s beta launch , over 10,000 new users onboarded, propelling presale figures past the $13 million mark. With an alpha launch scheduled soon, demand is expected to surge even further. Market analysts anticipate that RCO Finance could become one of the most influential DeFi projects of the next bull cycle. Given its crypto AI integration, security focus, and expansive asset selection, RCOF is already drawing comparisons to previous market leaders like Solana and Ethereum before their explosive rallies. Why RCO Finance (RCOF) is the Best Altcoin to Buy for the 2025 Bull Run Currently, RCO Finance is in Stage 5 of its token presale, with RCOF tokens priced at $0.10. Analysts project that once listed on major exchanges, the token’s price could rise to $0.40-$0.60, delivering an ROI of up to 600%. Some bullish projections suggest a 700x surge by Q2 2025, potentially mirroring Dogecoin’s historic rise. Staking RCOF tokens offers additional advantages, including high APYs of up to 86% and liquidity incentives. Investors who get in early will benefit from price appreciation and exclusive access to AI-powered financial tools that redefine crypto investing. RCO Finance holders gain access to cash rewards and gift prizes exceeding $100,000, along with frequent airdrop opportunities, quarterly dividends ranging from 1-6%, priority customer support, and exclusive access to private syndicate ETF funds. With the market rapidly evolving into crypto AI and DeFi innovations, RCO Finance is positioning itself as the best altcoin to buy for 2025, setting the stage for what could be a record-breaking bull run.

XRP is gaining attention as discussions around an ETF gain traction, potentially making it more accessible to mainstream financial markets. Meanwhile, Solana’s (SOL) price analysis suggests a bullish trend, signaling potential market growth. At the same time, Web3Bay is emerging as a major player in online shopping by using blockchain to eliminate middlemen, reducing costs for buyers while ensuring higher earnings for sellers. This shift enhances efficiency and brings fairness to the digital marketplace. Web3Bay is showing how blockchain technology can be applied practically in daily transactions, positioning itself as a strong name in the Web3 cryptocurrency sector. Web3Bay: Changing Online Shopping with Blockchain Web3Bay is introducing a new way to buy online, leveraging blockchain to remove unnecessary intermediaries. By doing this, sellers can retain a larger share of earnings, and buyers benefit from lower prices. The platform ensures safe, clear transactions, making online shopping more reliable and transparent for everyone. With the expansion of Web3-based cryptocurrencies, Web3Bay is integrating blockchain into everyday online transactions. This approach makes shopping smoother and more affordable, avoiding the high fees imposed by large e-commerce platforms. Blockchain in Web3Bay is not just a concept but a real tool for improving online shopping, benefiting buyers and sellers alike. Web3Bay is not only improving e-commerce but also demonstrating how blockchain can be used in practical ways. While XRP is working towards an ETF to increase financial accessibility, Web3Bay is bringing blockchain technology directly to e-commerce, showing that digital advancements can make real-world shopping easier. The growing interest in the project is reflected in its presale, which has raised over $1.4 million and sold more than 360 million coins. The fourth stage of the presale is witnessing strong demand, with 3BAY coins available at $0.004562. XRP ETF: Expanding Access to the Market As XRP continues through the regulatory process, the idea of an XRP ETF is gaining more attention. If approved, this could allow XRP to be traded on major financial platforms, making it easier for a wider audience to access. An ETF would not only increase the reach of XRP but also bring more stability and credibility to its position in the financial market. The anticipation around the SEC’s decision reflects a larger interest in cryptocurrency being integrated into mainstream finance. If an ETF is approved, it could drive up XRP’s value significantly, making it more attractive to traders. This move highlights XRP’s potential beyond digital currency, showing its growing role in the financial system. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis: Growth Signals in the Market Solana is gaining attention for its strong technical foundation and increasing adoption, making it a key subject in Solana (SOL) price analysis. As the platform improves its technology and scales up, interest from developers and traders continues to rise. This sustained momentum suggests a positive trend for Solana’s future price movements. In addition, Solana is expanding into important areas such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs. These integrations add to the platform’s long-term appeal and could push its value higher. Solana’s capabilities make it a strong presence in the cryptocurrency sector, and a recent Solana (SOL) price analysis indicates a promising outlook for its continued growth. Final Thoughts With the expected changes surrounding XRP ETF and the strengthening market position of Solana (SOL), cryptocurrency continues to see notable shifts. The approval of an XRP ETF could open doors for wider access, making XRP more appealing to traders. Meanwhile, Solana’s continuous advancements are securing its place as a significant digital asset. At the same time, Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce by applying blockchain to improve online shopping. By removing middlemen, it ensures better earnings for sellers and lower costs for buyers. These ongoing developments highlight how blockchain is making a direct impact on both financial markets and everyday commerce, bringing real advantages to users.

Uniswap revolutionized token trading by eliminating intermediaries, while Aave reshaped lending with decentralized liquidity pools. Both have expanded significantly, with Uniswap processing trillions in trades and Aave securing billions in deposits. However, BlockDAG has outpaced expectations, surpassing 140,000 holders and raising nearly $200 million. Unlike its predecessors, BlockDAG’s success is fueled by continuous engagement through AMA sessions, transparent development, and a rapidly expanding ecosystem. With its mainnet launch approaching, BlockDAG is proving to be more than just another DeFi project—it’s a transformative force. BlockDAG’s AMA Sessions Drive Global Adoption, Surging Past 140K Holders BlockDAG’s commitment to transparency and regular engagement has propelled its presale to unprecedented heights, transforming it from a promising project into a major force in the crypto space. Notably, with over 140,000 unique holders—a sharp rise from 92,000 just months ago—BlockDAG’s open communication through AMA sessions has played a key role in building trust and excitement among investors. Moreover, the numbers speak for themselves. BlockDAG’s presale fundraising has now nearly reached $200 million, with over 18.5 billion BDAG coins sold. Currently in batch 27, BDAG is priced at $0.0248, marking an astonishing 2,340% ROI since batch 1. This rapid growth is fueled by a mix of retail investors and institutional backers who recognize BlockDAG’s potential as it moves toward its mainnet launch. Furthermore, past AMAs have provided critical insights into the testnet launch, mining innovations, and upcoming partnerships, cementing BlockDAG’s position as a serious player. With the next AMA scheduled for February 20, the community is eager for more updates on the project’s roadmap, exchange listings, and ecosystem expansion. As a result, BlockDAG isn’t just another crypto project—it’s a movement backed by an engaged and growing community. As excitement builds, all eyes are on the next AMA to see what’s next for this record-breaking presale. Ultimately, will this be the session that pushes BlockDAG past the $200 million milestone? Uniswap: Transforming Decentralized Trading Uniswap launched in 2018 as an automated market maker (AMM) protocol, allowing users to trade ERC-20 tokens directly from their wallets without intermediaries. Specifically, created by Hayden Adams, Uniswap introduced liquidity pools where users deposit token pairs to facilitate decentralized swaps. This innovation replaced traditional order books, ensuring continuous liquidity. Since its launch, Uniswap has processed over $2.6 trillion in trading volume. Additionally, the release of Uniswap v4 in early 2025 enhanced efficiency by reducing gas fees and offering advanced features. UNI, the platform’s governance token, has rewarded early investors significantly. As of February 18, 2025, UNI is priced at $9.67, maintaining its position as a major DeFi asset. With ongoing upgrades and market adoption, Uniswap continues to lead decentralized exchanges. Consequently, its open-source model, permissionless nature, and scalability improvements position it as a key player in the evolution of DeFi trading solutions. Aave: Decentralized Lending at Scale Aave originated as ETHLend in 2017 before rebranding in 2018 and shifting to a liquidity pool model. As a result, it enables users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies without intermediaries, earning interest on deposits while borrowers secure loans through overcollateralization. This model revolutionized lending by eliminating centralized control. By the end of 2024, Aave’s total deposits exceeded $35 billion, a sharp rise from $5.5 billion in 2022. Additionally, its support for multiple assets and flexible borrowing options contributed to its expansion. As of February 18, 2025, AAVE trades at $255.05, reflecting the protocol’s sustained demand and investor confidence. Moreover, Aave’s continuous development, including layer-2 integrations and new lending mechanisms, keeps it at the forefront of decentralized finance. By offering efficient capital deployment and competitive interest rates, Aave remains a dominant force in the lending sector, attracting both institutional and retail participants seeking non-custodial financial solutions. Final Take Growth and adoption define a project’s long-term impact, and few have sustained momentum like Uniswap, Aave, and BlockDAG. Uniswap reshaped decentralized trading, Aave transformed lending, and both continue to attract investors. However, BlockDAG has set itself apart with record-breaking presale numbers, surpassing 140,000 holders and nearing $200 million in funding.

The Financial Services Commission (FSC) is poised to announce sanctions against Upbit, South Korea’s leading cryptocurrency exchange. This decisive action stems from alleged failures in meeting critical customer verification requirements, a cornerstone of anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. Why is Upbit Facing Potential Sanctions? Understanding Crypto Exchange Sanctions The looming crypto exchange sanctions against Upbit are not arbitrary. They are the result of a rigorous inspection conducted by the FSC’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). This investigation, initiated in August of the previous year during Upbit’s virtual asset service provider (VASP) license renewal process, unearthed significant concerns. The FIU reportedly discovered hundreds of thousands of instances where Upbit allegedly fell short of anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. A key area of concern was the exchange’s adherence to Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, which are mandatory for preventing illicit activities within the digital asset space. To put it simply, KYC and AML regulations are designed to ensure that crypto exchanges know who their customers are and can effectively prevent their platforms from being used for money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illegal activities. Failing to meet these standards can have severe consequences, as Upbit is now discovering. South Korean Crypto Regulation: A Closer Look at the Crackdown This situation underscores the increasingly stringent stance of South Korean crypto regulation . South Korea has emerged as a major hub for cryptocurrency trading and innovation. However, with this prominence comes increased scrutiny from regulators determined to protect investors and maintain financial integrity. The FSC’s investigation and potential sanctions against Upbit are a clear signal that Korean authorities are serious about enforcing compliance within the digital asset sector. Here’s a breakdown of what this regulatory focus means for the crypto industry in South Korea: Investor Protection: The primary goal is to safeguard investors from fraud, market manipulation, and other risks associated with cryptocurrencies. AML/KYC Enforcement: Strict adherence to anti-money laundering and Know Your Customer regulations is non-negotiable for crypto exchanges operating in South Korea. Market Stability: Regulators aim to create a stable and transparent crypto market that fosters innovation while mitigating systemic risks. International Standards: South Korea is aligning its crypto regulations with international standards set by bodies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The Core Issue: KYC AML Compliance and Its Importance At the heart of the matter lies KYC AML compliance . These are not just bureaucratic hurdles; they are essential for maintaining the legitimacy and security of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Let’s delve deeper into why KYC and AML are so critical: Aspect Importance Preventing Money Laundering KYC and AML procedures help identify and prevent criminals from using crypto exchanges to launder illicit funds. Combating Terrorist Financing By verifying customer identities and monitoring transactions, exchanges can help prevent funds from reaching terrorist organizations. Protecting Users from Fraud KYC measures can deter fraudsters and make it harder for them to operate anonymously on crypto platforms. Building Trust in the Crypto Market Robust KYC/AML compliance enhances the credibility and trustworthiness of the crypto industry, attracting more mainstream adoption. What’s Next? The Financial Regulator Decision and Potential Impacts All eyes are now on the impending financial regulator decision from the FSC. Chairman Kim Byoung-hwan’s announcement indicates that a resolution is imminent. The nature of the sanctions remains undisclosed, but they could range from fines and operational restrictions to more severe penalties depending on the gravity of the compliance failures. The potential impacts of these sanctions are multifaceted: Upbit’s Operations: Sanctions could disrupt Upbit’s operations, potentially affecting its trading volumes and market share in South Korea. Market Confidence: The decision will likely influence investor confidence in Upbit and the broader South Korean crypto market. Strict sanctions could be interpreted as a sign of regulatory seriousness, while lenient penalties might be seen as insufficient. Industry-Wide Implications: Other crypto exchanges in South Korea and globally will be closely watching the outcome. This case serves as a stark reminder of the importance of regulatory compliance in the crypto space. Future of Crypto Regulation: The FSC’s decision could set a precedent for future regulatory actions against crypto exchanges in South Korea and potentially inspire similar measures in other jurisdictions. Navigating the Evolving Crypto Regulatory Landscape For cryptocurrency users and businesses, the Upbit situation provides crucial lessons: Prioritize Compliance: Crypto exchanges must invest in robust KYC/AML compliance programs and continuously adapt to evolving regulatory requirements. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments in your jurisdiction and understand your obligations. Choose Compliant Platforms: When selecting a crypto exchange, prioritize platforms with a strong track record of regulatory compliance and transparency. Engage with Regulators: Proactive dialogue and collaboration with regulators can help shape constructive and effective crypto regulations. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Crypto in South Korea The upcoming decision on Upbit sanctions represents a critical moment for the cryptocurrency industry in South Korea. It underscores the growing emphasis on regulatory compliance and investor protection in the digital asset space. As the FSC prepares to announce its verdict, the crypto world waits with bated breath, understanding that this decision could have far-reaching consequences for the future of crypto regulation and the operation of exchanges worldwide. The message is clear: in the evolving landscape of digital finance, compliance is not optional—it’s imperative.

Today, all eyes are on WTI oil as prices dramatically recover, breaching the $71 mark. This surge isn’t due to typical market fluctuations, but rather a significant event: supply disruptions originating from the crucial Caspian region . For crypto investors watching broader economic trends, understanding these energy market movements is vital. Let’s dive into what’s causing this spike and what it means for the global economy. Why is WTI Oil Price Surging? Unpacking the Caspian Supply Disruptions The primary driver behind the recent WTI oil price increase is the reported attack on a key oil pipeline pumping station in the Caspian region . Specifically, the Kropotkinskaya station in Russia’s Krasnodar region, operated by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, was struck by drones. This incident has directly impacted oil flows from Kazakhstan, a major producer, to global markets. Western producers rely on this route, and the disruption is causing ripples across the energy market . Drone Attack Impact: The attack on the Kropotkinskaya pumping station has physically slowed down the transportation of crude oil . Supply Chain Bottleneck: Reduced flows from Kazakhstan directly translate to tighter global crude oil supplies. Market Reaction: As supply concerns escalate, the price of WTI oil , a global benchmark, naturally increases due to anticipated scarcity. Giovanni Staunovo, a UBS analyst, highlighted the growing concern, stating, “Although those drone attacks so far had limited disruption impacts on Russian crude oil exports, the rising frequency of those attacks is a concern that at some point it triggers some supply risks.” This sentiment underscores the market’s sensitivity to geopolitical instability and its potential impact on energy market stability. Geopolitical Tensions and WTI: A Delicate Balancing Act Beyond the immediate impact of the Caspian pipeline incident, broader geopolitical factors are at play. The Russia-Ukraine war and escalating trade tensions are casting shadows over the WTI oil market. Ceasefire Talks: A Double-Edged Sword? Potential ceasefire talks between Moscow and Kyiv introduce a complex dynamic. While a ceasefire could de-escalate tensions, it might also lead to: Easing of Sanctions: Reduced sanctions on Russia could potentially increase global oil supplies, which might exert downward pressure on the WTI oil price . Increased Supply: Resumption of normal oil production and export activities could flood the market, again potentially lowering prices. Conversely, the absence of a ceasefire keeps supply concerns elevated, potentially supporting higher WTI oil prices in the long run. Trade War Threats: A Looming Economic Headwind? The specter of a global trade war, particularly with the US considering reciprocal tariffs, adds another layer of uncertainty. Trade wars can: Slow Global Growth: Tariffs and trade barriers can hinder economic activity, reducing overall demand for crude oil . Demand Reduction: Lower global demand typically translates to decreased demand for WTI oil and other energy commodities, potentially leading to price declines. Understanding WTI Oil: FAQs for Crypto-Savvy Investors For those in the crypto space, understanding traditional markets like WTI oil is increasingly important. Here are some frequently asked questions to bring you up to speed: Question Answer What exactly is WTI oil ? WTI stands for West Texas Intermediate. It’s a high-grade, light, sweet crude oil benchmark, prized for its refining ease. Sourced in the US and distributed via Cushing, Oklahoma, “The Pipeline Crossroads of the World”. What drives the crude oil price of WTI? Basic economics: supply and demand. Global economic growth boosts demand, while recessions dampen it. Geopolitical events, wars, and OPEC decisions significantly impact supply. The US Dollar’s strength also plays a role, as oil is USD-denominated. How do inventory reports affect the energy market and WTI oil price ? Weekly inventory data from the API and EIA reveals supply and demand shifts. Declining inventories suggest higher demand, pushing prices up. Rising inventories indicate oversupply, potentially lowering prices. EIA data is considered more authoritative. What’s OPEC’s influence on the WTI oil price ? OPEC, and OPEC+ (including Russia), control a significant portion of global oil production. Their decisions on production quotas directly impact supply. Cuts tighten supply, raising prices; increases loosen supply, lowering prices. Navigating the Energy Market Landscape The recovery of WTI oil above $71, fueled by supply disruptions in the Caspian region , highlights the interconnectedness of global markets. From drone attacks on pipelines to geopolitical tensions and trade war threats, a multitude of factors are influencing the crude oil price and the broader energy market . For investors, whether in crypto or traditional assets, staying informed about these dynamics is crucial for making sound decisions in an increasingly volatile world.

This statement, delivered on Monday, February 18, 2025, underscores the critical juncture at which European security finds itself, particularly in the context of the ongoing Ukraine crisis . For cryptocurrency investors and market watchers, understanding these geopolitical shifts is paramount as they significantly influence risk sentiment and asset valuations, including gold price and the broader cryptocurrency impact . Starmer’s Stark Assessment of European Security Starmer’s comments, as reported by Reuters, highlight a pressing need for a robust security framework to ensure lasting peace in the region. His key assertions paint a clear picture of the challenges and the proposed solutions: US Security Guarantee is Vital: Starmer emphasized that a “US backstop” is not just preferred, but absolutely necessary to effectively deter Russia from future aggression against Ukraine. This underlines the indispensable role of the United States in maintaining European security and stability. Existential Threat to Europe: The Prime Minister didn’t mince words, stating unequivocally that “The future of Ukraine is an existential issue for Europe.” This powerful statement elevates the Ukraine crisis beyond a regional conflict, framing it as a matter of survival and fundamental importance for the entire European continent. Europe Must Share the Burden: While acknowledging the necessity of US involvement, Starmer also called for greater European responsibility, stating, “It is pressing that they now share the burden. Europe must play its role.” This call to action urges European nations to step up their contributions to collective security. These points collectively paint a picture of a precarious situation where the stakes are incredibly high, not just for Ukraine, but for the entire fabric of European security . Market Reaction: Gold Price and Risk Sentiment Amidst these geopolitical tensions, financial markets are closely monitoring the developments. As of the press time, the gold price showed a slight uptick, trading at $2,899, up 0.07% on the day. This marginal increase can be interpreted as a subtle indicator of prevailing risk sentiment . To better understand how such events influence market dynamics, it’s crucial to grasp the concepts of “risk-on” and “risk-off” sentiment. Understanding Risk Sentiment: Risk-On vs. Risk-Off In financial markets, the terms “risk-on” and “risk-off” are fundamental in gauging investor behavior and market trends. Here’s a breakdown: Sentiment Investor Behavior Market Outlook Risk-On Optimistic, willing to invest in riskier assets Positive future outlook, growth anticipated Risk-Off Cautious, preferring safer assets Worried about future, uncertainty prevails During periods of risk-on sentiment , investors are more inclined to seek higher returns, often investing in assets perceived as riskier but with greater growth potential. Conversely, in a risk-off environment , the priority shifts to capital preservation, leading investors towards safer, more stable assets. Assets to Watch: Gauging Risk Sentiment Certain asset classes are particularly sensitive to shifts in risk sentiment , making them valuable indicators for traders and investors: Risk-On Assets: Stock Markets: Generally rise as investors anticipate economic growth. Commodities (ex-Gold): Most commodities gain value due to positive growth forecasts. Commodity Currencies: Currencies of commodity-exporting nations strengthen. Examples include AUD, CAD, NZD. Cryptocurrencies: Tend to rise as part of risk assets, reflecting speculative investment. Risk-Off Assets: Bonds (Government): Especially major government bonds, increase in demand as safe havens. Gold: Often shines as a safe-haven asset during uncertainty. Safe-Haven Currencies: Currencies like JPY, CHF, and USD strengthen. Currency Dynamics in Risk-On and Risk-Off Markets Understanding which currencies strengthen under different risk sentiment scenarios is crucial for Forex traders and those monitoring global financial flows. Risk-On Currencies These currencies are typically tied to economies that benefit from global growth and commodity demand: Australian Dollar (AUD) Canadian Dollar (CAD) New Zealand Dollar (NZD) Minor FX: Ruble (RUB), South African Rand (ZAR) These economies are heavily reliant on commodity exports, and increased global economic activity drives demand and prices for these commodities, thus strengthening their currencies. Risk-Off Currencies These currencies are sought after for their stability and safety during times of market uncertainty: US Dollar (USD): The world’s reserve currency, bolstered by demand for US government debt in crises. Japanese Yen (JPY): Japanese government bonds are largely held domestically, providing stability even in crises. Swiss Franc (CHF): Swiss banking laws and capital protection attract investors seeking safety. Implications for Cryptocurrency Investors For those invested in or watching the cryptocurrency market , Starmer’s warning and the broader Ukraine crisis have significant implications. Geopolitical instability often fuels risk-off sentiment , which can impact cryptocurrency impact in complex ways. While cryptocurrencies are sometimes seen as alternative safe havens, particularly Bitcoin, their behavior in times of geopolitical stress can be varied. Initially, a flight to safety might see investors move towards traditional safe havens like gold and the US dollar. However, prolonged uncertainty and potential financial system disruptions could also increase interest in decentralized assets like cryptocurrencies as a hedge against traditional financial risks. Currently, the slight uptick in gold price alongside Starmer’s comments suggests a cautious market mood. Investors are likely monitoring the Ukraine crisis and its potential escalation, which could further drive risk-off sentiment . For cryptocurrency holders, this means being prepared for potential volatility and understanding that the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape plays a crucial role in market movements. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty in European Security and Crypto Markets Keir Starmer’s statement serves as a critical reminder of the intertwined nature of global politics and financial markets. The Ukraine crisis is not just a regional issue; it’s a matter of European security with far-reaching consequences for global risk sentiment and asset valuations. For cryptocurrency investors, staying informed about these geopolitical developments and understanding their potential cryptocurrency impact is essential. Monitoring indicators like gold price and risk-off/risk-on shifts can provide valuable insights for navigating these uncertain times. The need for a “US backstop” and the call for greater European burden-sharing underscore the urgency and complexity of the situation, demanding vigilance and strategic awareness from all market participants.

All eyes are on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) as they gear up for their first monetary policy decision of 2025. Whispers in the market strongly suggest a potential shift in strategy – a cut in interest rates. But what does this mean for the Australian Dollar, the broader economy, and even your crypto portfolio? Let’s dive deep into the anticipated RBA interest rate decision and what it could unleash. Why is the RBA Considering an Interest Rate Cut Now? For months, the RBA has held the Official Cash Rate (OCR) steady at 4.35%, battling stubbornly high inflation. However, the latest economic indicators are painting a slightly different picture. Inflation pressures in Australia appear to be easing, prompting speculation about a change in the RBA’s stance. Let’s break down the key factors influencing this potential shift: Easing Inflation: The most recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) data revealed a slower-than-expected rise in inflation during the final quarter of 2024. The RBA’s preferred measure, the Trimmed Mean CPI, also showed a moderation, hinting that previous rate hikes might be starting to bite. Economic Growth Concerns: While inflation remained elevated, the Australian economy has shown signs of sluggish growth. Persistent high interest rates can put a strain on households and businesses, potentially further dampening economic activity. A rate cut could be seen as a measure to inject some life back into the economy. Global Economic Uncertainty: The global economic landscape remains uncertain, with potential headwinds from international trade tensions and varying growth trajectories across major economies. A proactive move by the RBA could be aimed at safeguarding the Australian economy against external shocks. Despite these factors, it’s not a straightforward decision. Solid employment growth presents a counter-argument against aggressive rate cuts. The robust job market, with annual employment growth strengthening to 3.1% in December, suggests the economy isn’t in dire straits. This complexity adds an element of suspense to the upcoming RBA announcement. Decoding the Expected RBA Interest Rate Decision: 25 bps Cut on the Horizon? Market consensus strongly leans towards a 25 basis points (bps) cut to the OCR. This expectation is built upon: Inflation Data: As mentioned, the latest CPI figures provided a crucial signal that inflation might be on a downward trajectory. The Trimmed Mean CPI coming in below expectations was a significant factor. RBA’s Own Signals: Recent statements from the RBA, particularly the minutes from previous meetings, suggest a subtle shift in tone. While initially emphasizing upside risks to inflation, the RBA has more recently expressed “some confidence” that inflation is moving towards their 2-3% target range. Market Pricing: Financial markets have already priced in a high probability of a 25 bps cut, indicating a strong conviction among investors and analysts. However, it’s crucial to remember that central bank decisions are never guaranteed. The RBA could still opt to hold rates steady, or even surprise the market with a larger 50 bps cut if they are deeply concerned about economic slowdown. The actual statement accompanying the decision will be just as important as the rate move itself, offering crucial clues about the RBA’s future policy path. How Will an AUD Interest Rate Cut Impact the Australian Dollar? A cut in interest rates generally tends to weaken a currency. Therefore, if the RBA delivers the expected 25 bps interest rate cut, the Australian Dollar (AUD) could face selling pressure. However, the extent of the AUD’s weakness will depend on several factors: Magnitude of the Cut: A 25 bps cut is largely priced in. A surprise 50 bps cut would likely trigger a more significant AUD sell-off. Forward Guidance: The RBA’s statement and Governor Bullock’s press conference will be critical. If the RBA signals further rate cuts are likely in the near future (a dovish stance), the AUD could weaken considerably. Conversely, if they emphasize a cautious approach to easing, suggesting spaced-out cuts (a hawkish cut), the AUD’s downside might be limited, or it could even see a temporary bounce. Global Context: The performance of the US Dollar (USD) and overall market sentiment will also play a role. If the USD remains weak, as suggested by recent market trends influenced by US fiscal policy and Federal Reserve expectations, the AUD/USD pair might see limited downside even with an RBA rate cut. Valeria Bednarik, Chief Analyst at Bitcoin World, offers a technical perspective on the AUD/USD pair: “The AUD/USD pair has shown bullish momentum, reaching its highest level since mid-December. Technically, there’s scope for further gains towards the 0.6470 region if the pair can overcome immediate resistance at 0.6373. However, a dovish RBA outcome could trigger a slide below 0.6300, potentially exposing the 0.6230 zone.” What are the Broader Economic Implications of RBA’s Decision? Beyond the immediate impact on the Australian Dollar, the RBA’s interest rate decision has wider implications for the Australian economy: Borrowing Costs: A rate cut would reduce borrowing costs for households and businesses, potentially stimulating spending and investment. This could provide a welcome boost to economic growth. Housing Market: Lower interest rates can fuel demand in the housing market, potentially leading to increased property prices. This can be a double-edged sword, offering wealth effects for homeowners but also raising concerns about housing affordability. Inflation Expectations: The RBA needs to carefully manage inflation expectations. While aiming to ease current pressures, they must avoid signaling a premature victory over inflation, which could lead to a resurgence in price increases down the line. Savings and Investments: Lower interest rates can reduce returns on savings accounts and fixed-income investments, potentially encouraging savers to seek higher-yielding assets, including riskier investments. Navigating the Forex Market After the RBA Rate Cut: Key Strategies For Forex traders, the RBA interest rate decision presents both opportunities and risks. Here are some key strategies to consider: AUD/USD Trading: Monitor the AUD/USD pair closely around the announcement. A dovish RBA outcome could present short-selling opportunities, while a hawkish cut might offer long opportunities if the pair breaks above resistance levels. Cross-Currency Pairs: Consider trading AUD against other currencies, such as the Japanese Yen (JPY) or the Euro (EUR). The relative monetary policy stances of these central banks compared to the RBA will be crucial in determining cross-currency movements. Risk Management: Volatility is likely to spike around the RBA announcement. Employ robust risk management techniques, including stop-loss orders and appropriate position sizing, to protect your capital. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest news and analysis from reputable sources like Bitcoin World to stay ahead of market developments and refine your trading strategies. RBA FAQs: Understanding the Basics Let’s address some frequently asked questions about the RBA and its influence: What is the Reserve Bank of Australia and how does it influence the Australian Dollar? The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is Australia’s central bank. It sets interest rates and manages monetary policy to maintain price stability (inflation between 2-3%) and contribute to the stability of the currency, full employment, and economic prosperity. Higher interest rates generally strengthen the AUD, while lower rates tend to weaken it. How does inflation data impact the value of the Australian Dollar? Moderately higher inflation can lead central banks like the RBA to raise interest rates to control prices. Higher rates attract foreign investment, increasing demand for the AUD and thus its value. Conversely, very low inflation or deflation can signal economic weakness and potentially lead to rate cuts, weakening the AUD. How does economic data influence the value of the Australian Dollar? Strong economic data (e.g., GDP growth, strong employment, positive PMIs) suggests a healthy economy, attracting investment and potentially leading to higher interest rates by the RBA. This generally strengthens the AUD. Weak economic data can have the opposite effect. What is Quantitative Easing (QE) and how does it affect the Australian Dollar? Quantitative Easing (QE) is an unconventional monetary policy tool used in crises. The RBA prints AUD to buy assets (usually government bonds) to inject liquidity into the financial system. QE typically weakens the AUD as it increases the supply of the currency. What is Quantitative tightening (QT) and how does it affect the Australian Dollar? Quantitative Tightening (QT) is the reverse of QE. The RBA reduces its balance sheet by stopping asset purchases and allowing bonds to mature without reinvesting. QT is usually implemented during economic recovery to combat inflation and is considered bullish for the AUD as it reduces currency supply. Economic Indicator: RBA Trimmed Mean CPI (QoQ) The Trimmed Mean CPI is a key inflation gauge for the RBA. It measures the change in prices of a basket of goods and services, excluding the most volatile components to provide a clearer picture of underlying inflation trends. A higher reading is generally AUD bullish, suggesting potential rate hikes, while a lower reading is AUD bearish, potentially leading to rate cuts. Last Release: Wed Jan 29, 2025 00:30 Frequency: Quarterly Actual: 0.5% Consensus: 0.6% Previous: 0.8% Source: Australian Bureau of Statistics Why it matters to traders? The CPI data is crucial for traders as it directly influences RBA policy decisions and the AUD’s valuation. Rising consumer prices can lead to RBA rate hikes, making the AUD more attractive to investors. Conclusion: Brace for Potential Australian Dollar Volatility The upcoming RBA interest rate decision is a crucial event for the Australian Dollar and the broader financial markets. While a 25 bps cut is widely anticipated due to easing inflation pressures, the RBA’s forward guidance and any surprises in the announcement will be key drivers of market reaction. Traders should prepare for potential volatility in the AUD and adjust their strategies accordingly. Keep a close watch on the RBA’s statement and Governor Bullock’s press conference for vital clues about the future path of Australian monetary policy and its impact on the Forex landscape.

Today’s spotlight is on China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), and its latest fixing of the USD/CNY reference rate . This seemingly minor adjustment carries significant weight, influencing not just the Chinese Yuan (CNY) but potentially broader market sentiment. Let’s dive into what this latest PBOC decision means and why it matters in the context of the global financial landscape. What is the Significance of the PBOC’s USD/CNY Reference Rate Setting? The PBOC , as China’s central bank , plays a pivotal role in managing the nation’s currency, the Chinese Yuan . One of its key tools is setting the daily USD/CNY reference rate . This rate, announced each morning, dictates the central parity around which the Yuan can trade against the US dollar in the onshore market. Think of it as an anchor for the day’s trading, influencing market expectations and currency movements. On Tuesday, the PBOC set the USD/CNY reference rate at 7.1697, a slight adjustment from the previous fix of 7.1702. While seemingly a small change, these daily adjustments are closely watched by traders and economists globally. Why? Signal of Intent: The reference rate provides a signal of the PBOC’s stance on the Yuan’s value. A stronger fix (lower USD/CNY rate) can indicate a desire to support the Yuan, while a weaker fix (higher USD/CNY rate) might suggest a more neutral or easing stance. Market Guidance: It helps guide market expectations for the Yuan’s daily trading range. Although the onshore Yuan can fluctuate within a permitted band around this rate, the fix acts as a powerful psychological and practical benchmark. Economic Stability: By managing the USD/CNY reference rate , the PBOC aims to maintain exchange rate stability, a key objective for economic stability in China. PBOC FAQs: Decoding China’s Central Bank Actions To better understand the context of this rate setting, let’s address some frequently asked questions about the PBOC and its operations: Question Answer What does the People’s Bank of China do? The primary goals of the PBOC are to maintain price stability, including exchange rate stability, and to foster economic growth. It also focuses on financial reforms and market development. Who controls the PBOC? The PBOC is state-owned and thus not fully autonomous. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) plays a significant role in its management and direction. What policy tools does the PBOC use? Unlike many Western central banks, the PBOC employs a broad range of tools, including: Seven-day Reverse Repo Rate (RRR) Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF) Foreign exchange interventions Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR) Loan Prime Rate (LPR) – China’s benchmark interest rate Are private banks allowed in China? Yes, China has a limited number of private banks, including digital lenders like WeBank and MYbank, backed by major tech companies. Why This Matters for the Chinese Yuan (CNY) and Beyond The subtle shift in the USD/CNY reference rate to 7.1697 reflects the PBOC’s ongoing management of the Chinese Yuan . In comparison to Reuters’ estimates of 7.2538, the set rate is notably stronger, suggesting a controlled approach to the Yuan’s valuation. This is particularly relevant given global economic uncertainties and currency fluctuations. For cryptocurrency investors, monitoring these traditional financial indicators is vital. Currency strength and stability, especially for major economies like China, can influence broader market sentiment and risk appetite. A stable or strengthening Chinese Yuan , guided by the PBOC’s measured approach to the USD/CNY reference rate , can contribute to a more predictable global financial environment, which indirectly impacts the cryptocurrency markets as well. Actionable Insights Stay Informed: Keep an eye on daily USD/CNY reference rate fixings by the PBOC as indicators of potential shifts in China’s currency policy. Understand the Tools: Familiarize yourself with the PBOC’s policy tools beyond just interest rates, such as the RRR and MLF, to grasp their broader influence. Global Context: Recognize that China’s central bank actions, including USD/CNY reference rate settings, are part of a complex global economic interplay that can have ripple effects across all markets, including crypto. In Conclusion: The PBOC’s Steady Hand on the Yuan The PBOC’s latest USD/CNY reference rate adjustment, though incremental, is a testament to its active management of the Chinese Yuan . By carefully setting this daily benchmark, China’s central bank aims to foster stability and guide market expectations. For those navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, understanding these traditional financial mechanisms offers valuable context and a broader perspective on global economic currents. The PBOC’s actions, while focused on the Chinese Yuan , resonate throughout the financial world, reminding us of the interconnectedness of global markets.

40523001,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=130140,1739932188,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Encouraging Boost: Xi Jinping’s Bold Move to Revive China’s Private Sector,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/xi-jinping-boost-private-sector/,"In a potentially powerful move that has global markets buzzing, China’s President Xi Jinping has signaled a significant shift in Beijing’s economic strategy. The focus? Injecting fresh vigor into the nation’s long-underestimated private sector. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and forex traders closely monitoring global economic shifts, this development carries considerable weight, particularly for pairs like AUD/USD. Let’s dive into what this means and why it matters. Why is China’s Private Sector Boost a Game Changer? For years, China’s private sector, despite being a massive engine of growth, has often operated under the shadow of state-owned enterprises and regulatory uncertainties. President Xi’s recent meeting with prominent entrepreneurs, including Alibaba’s Jack Ma, suggests a notable change in approach. The key message is clear: Beijing is now actively championing the private sector as crucial for economic revival. This is not just rhetoric; it’s a strategic pivot with potentially far-reaching consequences. Xi Jinping’s statements emphasized the need to: Eliminate Obstacles: Resolutely remove barriers hindering equal access to production resources and fair market competition. This signals a commitment to leveling the playing field for private businesses. Open Infrastructure: Continue promoting fair access to infrastructure sectors for all types of businesses. This move could unlock significant growth opportunities for private companies in crucial industries. Ease Financing: Make substantial efforts to resolve the persistent problem of difficult and expensive financing for private enterprises. Access to capital is the lifeblood of business growth, and this pledge addresses a major pain point. How Does This Impact the Australian Dollar (AUD/USD)? The ripple effects of China’s economic policies are felt globally, and the Australian Dollar (AUD) is particularly sensitive to China’s economic health. Why? Australia’s economy is heavily intertwined with China, its largest trading partner. A robust Chinese economy typically translates to increased demand for Australian exports, especially commodities like iron ore. Let’s break down the key connections: China Economy Revive and the Australian Dollar A revitalized China economy revive , fueled by a stronger private sector, implies increased economic activity. This generally leads to: Higher Demand for Australian Exports: As China’s economy expands, so does its need for raw materials and resources, a significant portion of which comes from Australia. Positive Impact on AUD: Increased demand for Australian goods boosts the Australian Dollar . Think of it as simple supply and demand – more demand for AUD pushes its value up. AUD/USD Dynamics: A stronger AUD relative to the US Dollar can lead to an upward movement in the AUD/USD exchange rate. Understanding the AUD/USD Relationship in Detail To truly grasp the potential impact, let’s revisit the factors driving the Australian Dollar , as highlighted in the original article’s FAQs: Factor Impact on AUD RBA Interest Rates Higher rates generally support AUD; lower rates weaken AUD. Iron Ore Prices Higher prices boost AUD; lower prices weaken AUD. China Economy Health Stronger economy strengthens AUD; weaker economy weakens AUD. Australian Inflation & Growth Stronger economy and controlled inflation support AUD. Trade Balance Positive balance strengthens AUD; negative balance weakens AUD. Market Sentiment (Risk-on/Risk-off) Risk-on sentiment is positive for AUD; risk-off is negative. As you can see, the health of the China economy is a major determinant of the Australian Dollar ‘s value. Xi Jinping’s commitment to bolstering the private sector directly addresses this factor. If these policies translate into tangible economic improvements in China, we could see sustained positive pressure on the AUD. Market Reaction and What to Watch For The initial market reaction, as noted in the original article, showed AUD/USD slightly down. However, this could be a temporary blip or influenced by other factors, such as repositioning ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) decisions. Moving forward, keep a close eye on: Chinese Economic Data: Watch for upcoming economic indicators from China. Improvements in GDP growth, industrial production, and consumer spending will be key signals that the private sector boost is gaining traction. Iron Ore Prices: Monitor iron ore prices, as they directly reflect Chinese demand and impact the AUD. RBA Policy: The RBA’s monetary policy decisions and statements will continue to play a crucial role in AUD valuation. However, a stronger Chinese economy could give the RBA more flexibility. Global Market Sentiment: Overall risk appetite in global markets will also influence AUD/USD. Positive sentiment tends to favor the AUD as a risk-on currency. Actionable Insights for Traders For traders focusing on AUD/USD and related currency pairs, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed on China: Make tracking Chinese economic news a priority. Policy announcements, economic data releases, and geopolitical developments in China can all significantly impact the AUD. Monitor Commodity Prices: Keep a close watch on iron ore and other key Australian commodity exports. Price movements can provide early signals of shifts in Chinese demand and AUD direction. Combine Fundamental and Technical Analysis: Use fundamental analysis to assess the long-term impact of China’s policy shift and technical analysis to identify potential entry and exit points for trades. Manage Risk: As always, practice sound risk management. Currency markets can be volatile, and it’s crucial to manage your exposure appropriately. Conclusion: A Promising Sign for the Australian Dollar? President Xi Jinping’s call to boost China private sector is a potentially pivotal development for the global economy and particularly for the Australian Dollar . While the full impact will unfold over time, the initial signals are encouraging . A thriving Chinese private sector could be a significant tailwind for the AUD, supporting higher commodity prices and increased demand for Australian exports. For traders and investors, staying attuned to developments in China and their impact on the AUD/USD pair is now more crucial than ever.

Experts suggest that this dwindling ETH supply could indicate an impending ‘supply shock,’ potentially fuelling a significant rally in the cryptocurrency. Ethereum Reserves At 9-Year Low Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, continues to trade within the mid-$2,000 range, sitting at $2,721 at the time of writing. Unlike Bitcoin (BTC), ETH has had a relatively quiet 2024, struggling to break past its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878, recorded in November 2021. Related Reading: Ethereum Appears ‘Bottomed Out,’ Analyst Predicts A Rally Is Near This lackluster price action has contributed to waning investor confidence in ETH. However, the digital asset recently managed to defend the critical $2,380-$2,460 demand zone, rekindling bullish hopes for a potential breakout above the stubborn $3,000 resistance level. More notably, ETH reserves on centralized exchanges continue to plummet, which could lead to a supply shock – a scenario where demand for the asset surpasses its liquid supply. If this materializes, ETH may experience rapid price appreciation. For the uninitiated, a supply shock in the crypto industry occurs when the demand for the underlying digital asset exceeds its liquid supply. As a result, the underlying asset – ETH, in this case – may experience sharp price appreciation in a short time. As of today, ETH reserves on centralized crypto exchanges have fallen to 18.95 million, a level last seen in July 2016. Notably, ETH was trading at $14 at the time. Recent analysis from seasoned crypto analyst Crypto Buddha suggests that ETH may be on the verge of a major price move. The analyst highlights how ETH has broken through a diagonal resistance level, signalling a potential bullish breakout. Furthermore, Bitcoin (BTC) is exhibiting similar price behavior. A successful BTC breakout could spark a broader crypto market rally, driving significant gains across various digital assets. Crypto Buddha noted: Bitcoin‘s price action is following a similar pattern with a triangular convergence, raising the question of whether it can break through successfully like Ethereum. Since the low of $91,000, Bitcoin has been consolidating for 10 days. The market is at a crucial juncture, and it’s time to pick a direction. Will ETH Investors Finally Have Their Time? Unlike competitors such as Solana (SOL), SUI, and XRP, which have all seen significant price appreciation over the past year, ETH has struggled to capitalize on bullish momentum. Bearish sentiment surrounding ETH has been on unprecedented levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Positioned For A ‘Major Move Upward’ In 2025, Analyst Forecasts However, analysts are confident that ETH may soon surprise the market. Recent analysis by Titan of Crypto emphasizes that ETH may soon enter its ‘most hated rally,’ leading to major price appreciation. That said, concerns about the Ethereum Foundation selling copious amounts of ETH continue to haunt the holders. At press time, ETH trades at $2,721, down 4.7% in the past 24 hours.

The Australian Dollar (AUD) is experiencing a significant downturn as all eyes turn to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and their impending policy decision. Will the RBA pull the trigger on an interest rate cut ? The markets are on tenterhooks, and the Aussie Dollar is reflecting this pre-decision jitters. Let’s dive deep into what’s driving this market movement and what you should be watching. Why is the Australian Dollar (AUD) Weakening Ahead of the RBA Decision? The primary driver behind the Australian Dollar’s current depreciation is the widespread expectation that the RBA will announce a cut to its Official Cash Rate (OCR) on Tuesday. Traders are exercising caution, pulling back on AUD positions as they anticipate a potential reduction in the Aussie Dollar’s yield appeal. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors at play: Anticipated Interest Rate Cut: The market consensus points towards a 25 basis point cut, bringing the OCR down to 4.10%. This would be the first such cut in four years, signaling a potential shift in the RBA’s monetary policy. Inflation Concerns: While inflation is showing signs of easing in Australia, the trimmed mean inflation remains above the RBA’s target range of 2%-3%. This delicate balance between controlling inflation and stimulating economic growth adds complexity to the RBA’s decision-making. US Dollar Strength: Simultaneously, the US Dollar (USD) is gaining momentum, fueled by improved Treasury yields. This strengthens the USD against other currencies, including the AUD, further contributing to the AUD/USD pair’s downward pressure. In essence, it’s a perfect storm of factors weighing on the Australian Dollar . The anticipation of a domestic interest rate cut combined with a strengthening US Dollar is creating a bearish environment for the Aussie. Decoding the RBA Decision: Will it be a Rate Cut? The big question on everyone’s mind is: will the RBA actually cut rates? Recent economic data suggests a leaning towards a rate cut, but the RBA’s stance could be more nuanced. Let’s examine the data points influencing the expected RBA decision : Economic Indicator Data Implication for RBA December Consumer Price Index (CPI) Rose less than forecast Signals easing price pressures, supporting a rate cut Trimmed Mean CPI (Quarterly) 0.5% (below 0.6% expected) Further indication of moderating inflation Trimmed Mean CPI (Annualized) 3.2% (down from 3.5%) Inflation still above target range, potentially tempering aggressive rate cuts While the data shows inflation easing, it’s crucial to remember that the trimmed mean CPI is still above the RBA’s target band. This might lead the RBA to adopt a cautious approach, even if they proceed with a 25 bps cut. The accompanying policy statement will be critical in deciphering the RBA’s future intentions. US Dollar (USD) Ascends as Treasury Yields Improve Adding another layer to the AUD/USD dynamic is the resurgence of the US Dollar. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is climbing higher, breaking a three-session losing streak. This strength is attributed to improved US Treasury yields, making USD-denominated assets more attractive to investors. Key factors influencing the USD’s strength include: Rising Treasury Yields: Yields on 2-year and 10-year US Treasury bonds have risen to 4.26% and 4.50% respectively, indicating increased investor demand for US government debt. Hawkish Fed Stance: Federal Reserve officials, including Governor Michelle Bowman and Governor Christopher Waller, have emphasized the need for continued vigilance on inflation. Governor Bowman highlighted concerns about rising asset prices potentially hindering inflation progress, while Governor Waller stressed a data-driven approach and cautioned against policy uncertainty. Solid US Economic Growth: Despite a weaker-than-expected retail sales report in January, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has pointed to the strength of the US job market and solid economic growth, suggesting no urgency to cut US interest rates. The contrasting monetary policy stances – the potential for RBA rate cuts versus the Fed’s cautious approach – are widening the interest rate differential between Australia and the US, further bolstering the US Dollar at the expense of the Australian Dollar. Technical Outlook for AUD/USD: Key Levels to Watch From a technical perspective, the AUD/USD pair is currently trading around 0.6340. Let’s analyze the key technical levels that traders should monitor: Ascending Channel: The pair is trending upwards within an ascending channel, indicating an underlying bullish bias despite the recent pullback. Relative Strength Index (RSI): The 14-day RSI remains above 50, further supporting a bullish outlook in the medium term. Resistance Levels: Upper boundary of the ascending channel: 0.6390 Psychological resistance: 0.6400 Support Levels: 9-day EMA: 0.6316 14-day EMA: 0.6300 Lower boundary of the ascending channel: 0.6280 Traders should watch for a potential breakout above the ascending channel for further upside in AUD/USD . Conversely, a break below the 9-day EMA could signal further weakness towards the lower support levels.

Decoding Australian Dollar (AUD) Drivers: FAQs Want to understand the Australian Dollar better? Here are answers to some frequently asked questions: What key factors drive the Australian Dollar? RBA Interest Rates: Interest rate decisions by the Reserve Bank of Australia are a primary driver. Higher rates typically support the AUD. Iron Ore Prices: As a major export, iron ore prices significantly impact the Australian economy and the AUD. Chinese Economy Health: China is Australia’s largest trading partner, so Chinese economic performance heavily influences AUD demand. Australian Inflation and Growth: Domestic inflation levels, economic growth rates, and the trade balance are crucial fundamental factors. Market Sentiment: Global risk sentiment (risk-on/risk-off) affects the AUD, with risk-on generally being positive for the currency. How do the decisions of the Reserve Bank of Australia impact the Australian Dollar? The RBA uses interest rate adjustments as its primary tool to manage inflation and influence the economy. By raising or lowering rates, the RBA impacts borrowing costs, investment flows, and ultimately, the value of the Australian Dollar . Higher rates tend to attract foreign investment, increasing demand for the AUD and vice versa. Quantitative easing (QE) and tightening are also used, with QE being AUD-negative and tightening AUD-positive. How does the health of the Chinese Economy impact the Australian Dollar? China’s robust economic growth translates to increased demand for Australian raw materials, goods, and services. This heightened demand boosts the Australian Dollar . Conversely, a slowdown in the Chinese economy can dampen demand, weakening the AUD. Chinese economic data releases often trigger direct reactions in the AUD/USD pair. How does the price of Iron Ore impact the Australian Dollar? Iron ore, Australia’s top export, is a significant revenue generator. Rising iron ore prices increase demand for the Australian Dollar as more currency is needed to purchase this commodity. This positive correlation means higher iron ore prices generally lead to a stronger AUD, and vice versa. A positive trade balance, often boosted by strong iron ore exports, further supports the AUD. How does the Trade Balance impact the Australian Dollar? A positive Trade Balance, where exports exceed imports, indicates strong international demand for Australian goods and services. This surplus demand strengthens the Australian Dollar . Conversely, a negative Trade Balance can weaken the AUD. A healthy Trade Balance reflects a competitive export sector and is generally seen as a positive fundamental factor for the currency. Conclusion: Navigating the Australian Dollar Volatility The Australian Dollar is currently navigating a period of heightened volatility as the market anticipates the RBA’s interest rate cut decision . The confluence of domestic monetary policy expectations and global factors, particularly the strengthening US Dollar , is creating downward pressure on the Aussie. Traders should closely monitor the RBA’s announcement and accompanying statement for clues about future policy direction. Keep an eye on key technical levels for potential trading opportunities in the AUD/USD pair. The coming days promise to be crucial for the direction of the Australian Dollar in the Forex market.

40523115,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=130142,1739932492,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Soaring USD/INR: Indian Rupee Plunges Amid Relentless Foreign Fund Outflows,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/usd-inr-indian-rupee-outflows/,"Buckle up, crypto enthusiasts! While the crypto market keeps you on your toes, traditional currencies are also making waves. The USD/INR pair is currently experiencing a significant surge, grabbing attention in the forex market. What’s fueling this upward momentum, and what does it mean for the Indian Rupee? Let’s dive into the key factors driving this currency dynamic. Why is USD/INR Surging? Decoding the Drivers The USD/INR exchange rate is currently witnessing an upside extension, primarily driven by two major forces: Foreign Fund Outflows : India is experiencing significant foreign fund outflows , as Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) are pulling their investments out of domestic equities. This exodus of capital weakens demand for the Indian Rupee, pushing the USD/INR pair higher. US Dollar Demand : Simultaneously, the US Dollar is gaining strength in the global market. This increased US Dollar demand further exacerbates the pressure on the Indian Rupee, contributing to the upward trajectory of USD/INR. These dual pressures are creating a perfect storm for the Indian Rupee, leading to its depreciation against the US Dollar. RBI Intervention: Will it Halt the Rupee’s Slide? Amidst the weakening Indian Rupee , all eyes are on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The central bank is known to intervene in the forex market to manage currency volatility and maintain stability. Market analysts are speculating whether RBI intervention can effectively limit the INR’s losses in the face of persistent outflows and dollar strength. While RBI intervention can provide temporary relief and curb excessive depreciation, the underlying fundamental factors – foreign fund outflows and US Dollar demand – will likely continue to exert pressure on the Indian Rupee . The effectiveness of RBI’s measures remains a crucial point of observation for traders and investors. Analyzing the Indian Rupee’s Weakness: Key Factors at Play Several factors are contributing to the current weakness in the Indian Rupee : Domestic Equity Market Sentiment : Weakness in domestic equities is dampening investor sentiment and contributing to FII outflows. Global Trade War Fears : Resurfacing fears of a global trade war, particularly in response to potential tariff measures from the US, are adding to risk aversion and negatively impacting emerging market currencies like the INR. Widening Trade Deficit : India’s trade deficit widened in January, reaching $22.99 billion, further straining the Rupee. While a decline in gold imports partially offset this, the overall trade balance remains a concern. However, some factors are providing a slight cushion: Crude Oil Prices : A weak tone in crude oil prices can be beneficial for India, a major oil importer, potentially easing some pressure on the Rupee. US Treasury Yields : A decline in US Treasury yields can reduce the attractiveness of the US Dollar, offering limited support to the INR. USD/INR Technical Outlook: Bullish Momentum Persists From a technical perspective, the USD/INR pair is exhibiting a constructive bullish trend. Analyzing the daily chart: Above Key EMA : The USD/INR price remains above the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), indicating sustained bullish momentum. RSI Indicator : The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is above the midline at 55.0, further supporting the upward momentum and suggesting that the path of least resistance is to the upside. Key Technical Levels to Watch: Level Type USD/INR Level Significance Upside Barrier 1 87.00 Psychological Resistance. A break above could accelerate gains. Upside Target 2 88.00 All-time High. Next major target after 87.00 breach. Upside Target 3 88.50 Further potential target in extended bullish scenario. Initial Support 1 86.35 Low of February 12. First level of support in case of pullback. Support 2 86.14 Low of January 27. Stronger support level below 86.35. Indian Rupee FAQs: Understanding the Dynamics What are the key factors driving the Indian Rupee? The Indian Rupee (INR) is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including: Crude Oil Prices : India’s heavy reliance on oil imports makes the Rupee sensitive to crude oil price fluctuations. US Dollar Value : As most international trade is conducted in USD, the Dollar’s strength significantly impacts the INR. Foreign Investment Flows : Inflows and outflows of foreign investment are crucial determinants of Rupee’s value. RBI Intervention : The Reserve Bank of India’s actions in the forex market play a vital role in managing exchange rate stability. Interest Rates : Interest rate decisions by the RBI influence investor appetite for the Rupee. How do the decisions of the Reserve Bank of India impact the Indian Rupee? The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) impacts the Indian Rupee through: Forex Intervention : RBI actively intervenes to maintain a stable exchange rate, facilitating trade and managing volatility. Interest Rate Policy : By adjusting interest rates to manage inflation (targeting 4%), the RBI influences the Rupee’s attractiveness for investors, particularly in carry trades. Higher rates typically strengthen the Rupee. What macroeconomic factors influence the value of the Indian Rupee? Key macroeconomic factors affecting the Indian Rupee include: Inflation : Higher inflation can weaken the Rupee by reducing export competitiveness and potentially leading to capital outflows. Interest Rates : Higher real interest rates (adjusted for inflation) generally support the Rupee. GDP Growth Rate : Stronger economic growth can attract foreign investment, boosting Rupee demand. Balance of Trade : A less negative trade balance indicates stronger export performance, supporting the Rupee. Foreign Investment Inflows (FDI & FII) : Risk-on environments encourage FDI and FII inflows, strengthening the Rupee. How does inflation impact the Indian Rupee? Inflation’s impact on the Indian Rupee is nuanced: Negative Impact of High Inflation : Comparatively higher inflation can devalue the Rupee, increase export costs, and lead to more Rupees being sold for imports.

Bons said so in a Twitter post defending SOL, which is battling an image crisis in the wake of some high-profile meme coin scams on its platform. The most recent is the $4.5 billion $Libra token scandal that has entangled Argentine President Javier Millei. Others linked to the US First family have been dogged with accusations of insider trading that burnt many users. The CIO, a renowned Solana proponent, held that the blockchain’s dominance explained why scammers preferred it over the others. To him, SOL’s current woes are akin to those the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) blockchains faced in their glory days. He wrote: “Scammers & criminals will always seek out the cutting-edge, as it is on this frontier where they can extract the most, just like the Wild West of old. Does that make the frontier bad? Of course not, in the same way that BTC & ETH were not bad during their heydays.” – Justin Bons Solana faithful must accept some degree of chaos and danger Bons further claimed SOL was an open, public, and truly decentralized chain, which hindered it from containing grifters within its ranks. So, SOL users have to make that concession for the freedoms they enjoy. He called that bravery and challenged those who couldn’t stomach it to leave for other centralized chains. Again, he related Solana’s struggles to those of the early internet, which had a higher degree of porn and cyber crimes. But those shrunk with time as public adoption and consumer protections gathered steam, improving the medium’s respectability. Despite acknowledging the uncanny similarities between SOL and the early Internet, Bons found a major difference. He explained that, unlike the latter, the former consists of thousands of protocols jostling for adoption and dominance. That powerful free market dynamic was net positive as it drove innovation by exerting what he termed as “evolutionary pressure.” However, it exposed users to a lot of “evil,” which meant accepting some level of chaos and danger in return for freedom. Bons’ Solana defense divides opinion As expected, Bons’ analysis drew mixed reactions, with some netizens agreeing with him while others pushed back on his claims. Two users tweeting from X handles @Infrablix and @study0718 resonated with his views and the parallels he drew between crypto now and the internet in its infancy. Another user, @HawktuahA, took a contrary view, emphasizing that SOL’s construction enabled its easy exploitation and wondered how such a chain was a good thing. Still, some, like CardanoDave, were outrightly satirical with him posting a meme ridiculing Bons’ analysis. Roy stomp was even less genial, labeling the CIO a scam. Meanwhile, Xaspa samurai called him a jukebox, suggesting he was pandering to the wishes of the venture capitalists and crypto companies that had him in their pockets. What can Solana do to redeem its image? Some of the respondents also suggested ways in which SOL can clean up its image. Tommy WorldPower, for instance, advised that Solana could adopt a decentralized enforcement system to freeze the errant wallets, and reimburse victims their funds. Robert Sasu, on the other hand, criticized SOL for lacking the tools for arresting obvious rugpulls. He offered that setting minimal limits to token launches would cut off 99% of automatically created ones. Bons himself proposed the reintroduction of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) at scale, as the current regulatory environment allowed. He said ICOs leveled the playing field for VCs and retail investors.

All eyes are on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) as they gear up for their first monetary policy decision of 2025. Whispers of an RBA interest rate cut are growing louder, marking a potential turning point after four years of steady rates. Could this shift in monetary policy ignite volatility in the AUD/USD pair and ripple through the broader crypto market? Let’s dive into what’s expected and why it matters for your crypto portfolio. Will the RBA Deliver the Anticipated Interest Rate Cut? For months, the RBA has held the Official Cash Rate (OCR) firm at 4.35%, battling stubbornly high inflation. But the winds are changing. Signs of Australia inflation easing have emerged, fueling expectations that the central bank will finally pull the trigger on a 25 basis point (bps) interest rate cut. This move would be the first easing since 2020, a significant shift in the economic landscape. Here’s a quick rundown of the key factors at play: Easing Inflation: The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data reveals a slowdown in inflation in the final quarter of 2024. The RBA’s preferred measure, the Trimmed Mean CPI, edged down to 3.2% annually, signaling progress towards their 2-3% target range. Economic Slowdown Concerns: Persistent high interest rates are squeezing households and businesses, leading to concerns about sluggish economic growth. Policymakers are under pressure to provide some relief. Solid Employment Growth: While inflation is cooling, the job market remains robust. Annual employment growth hit a strong 3.1% in December, a factor that could temper the RBA’s enthusiasm for aggressive rate cuts. Despite the mixed signals, market consensus leans towards a rate cut. The question now isn’t necessarily *if* but *how* the RBA will communicate its decision and future intentions. Decoding the Monetary Policy Decision: What to Expect? The RBA’s monetary policy decision isn’t just about the immediate rate move; it’s about the signals they send regarding future policy. Here’s what market participants are keenly watching for: Scenario Likely AUD/USD Impact Crypto Market Reaction (Speculative) 25 bps Rate Cut (as expected) & Cautious Outlook Moderate AUD weakness initially, but potential rebound if future cuts are hinted to be gradual. Neutral to slightly positive sentiment. Reduced pressure on risk assets like crypto. 50 bps Rate Cut (unexpected) or Strong Dovish Signals Significant AUD sell-off. Positive sentiment. Risk-on environment potentially benefiting crypto. 25 bps Rate Cut & Hawkish Signals (hints at limited further easing) AUD could strengthen as markets interpret it as a ‘hawkish cut’. Potentially negative or neutral. Hawkish stance could weigh on broader risk assets. As Valeria Bednarik, Chief Analyst at Bitcoin World, points out, the devil will be in the details. Governor Michele Bullock’s press conference following the announcement will be crucial in deciphering the RBA’s true stance. Will they signal a series of rate cuts, or emphasize a cautious, gradual approach? How Will the RBA Decision Impact AUD/USD and Your Crypto Trades? The AUD/USD impact is a key consideration for crypto traders, particularly those involved in Forex pairings or using AUD as a fiat on-ramp. A weaker Aussie Dollar can influence trading strategies and potentially impact the value of crypto holdings when converted back to AUD. Bednarik’s technical analysis suggests AUD/USD is currently in a bullish stance, hitting its highest level since mid-December. However, the RBA’s announcement could be a pivotal moment. Here are key technical levels to watch: Resistance: 0.6373 (intraday high), 0.6430 (interim), 0.6470 (major resistance zone) Support: 0.6300, 0.6230 A dovish RBA outcome, signaling aggressive rate cuts, could push AUD/USD below the 0.6300 support, potentially triggering further declines. Conversely, hawkish undertones, even with a rate cut, might see the pair test higher resistance levels. Navigating the Interest Rate Outlook: Broader Economic Implications Understanding the interest rate outlook is essential for grasping the bigger picture. Central banks like the RBA use interest rates as a primary tool to manage inflation and stimulate or cool down the economy. Here’s a quick primer on central bank actions: Central Banks FAQs What is the main goal of a central bank? Price stability – keeping inflation within a target range (e.g., 2% for many major central banks). How do central banks control inflation? By adjusting the benchmark interest rate. Higher rates curb spending and investment, cooling inflation. Lower rates encourage borrowing and spending, boosting economic activity. Hawks vs. Doves: ‘Hawkish’ central bankers prioritize controlling inflation, even if it means slower growth. ‘Dovish’ policymakers are more concerned with supporting economic growth and are willing to tolerate slightly higher inflation. The RBA’s shift towards potential rate cuts reflects a global trend as central banks grapple with balancing inflation and economic growth. For crypto investors, monitoring these macroeconomic shifts is crucial as they can influence risk appetite and capital flows, impacting the crypto market. Conclusion: Brace for Potential AUD/USD Volatility The RBA’s upcoming decision is a significant event that could inject volatility into the AUD/USD pair and potentially influence broader market sentiment, including the cryptocurrency space. While an RBA interest rate cut is widely anticipated, the nuances of the accompanying statement and Governor Bullock’s commentary will be critical in shaping market reactions.

The NZD/USD pair is currently navigating a turbulent session, attracting sellers as we approach a pivotal moment: the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s (RBNZ) upcoming rate decision. All eyes are on Wednesday’s announcement, with widespread expectations of a significant interest rate cut. Will this anticipated move trigger a deeper plunge for the Kiwi, or are there any surprise factors that could shift the tide? Let’s dive into the factors driving this currency pair and what you need to watch out for in the volatile world of Forex News. NZD/USD Faces Selling Pressure Amid RBNZ Rate Decision Anticipation The NZD/USD pair is currently experiencing selling pressure, hovering near the 0.5700 mark as Tuesday’s Asian trading session unfolds. This downward momentum is largely attributed to the growing anticipation surrounding the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s (RBNZ) looming rate decision. Market consensus strongly suggests that the RBNZ will implement a substantial interest rate cut at its February meeting on Wednesday, further weighing on the New Zealand Dollar (NZD). Specifically, the market anticipates a significant interest rate cut of 50 basis points (bps), which would bring the Official Cash Rate (OCR) down to 3.75%. This aggressive move is expected to stimulate the New Zealand economy, but simultaneously, it exerts downward pressure on the NZD as lower interest rates typically make a currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking higher yields. Adding to the bearish sentiment, ASB chief economist Nick Tuffley suggests that this week’s cut might just be the beginning. According to Tuffley, the baseline scenario includes further 25bp cuts at each of the subsequent two meetings in April and May. This outlook for a sustained easing cycle is further dampening enthusiasm for the NZD. Decoding the RBNZ Rate Decision: What to Expect The upcoming RBNZ rate decision is more than just a number; it’s a crucial event that can significantly impact the NZD/USD pair and the broader Forex markets. Here’s what traders and investors should be focusing on: Official Cash Rate (OCR) Announcement: The headline event is, of course, the announcement of the new OCR. As mentioned, the consensus points towards a 50 bps cut to 3.75%. Any deviation from this expectation, especially a smaller cut or no cut at all, could trigger a sharp rally in the NZD. Governor Adrian Orr’s Press Conference: Following the rate announcement, RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr will hold a press conference. This is a highly anticipated event as his commentary and tone will provide crucial insights into the future monetary policy path. Pay close attention to any hints about the pace and extent of future rate cuts. Dovish remarks are likely to reinforce selling pressure on the Kiwi. Monetary Policy Statement: The official Monetary Policy Statement released alongside the rate decision will offer detailed justification for the RBNZ’s actions and its economic outlook. Scrutinize this statement for any changes in the RBNZ’s assessment of inflation, employment, and global economic risks. Trade War Concerns and the US Dollar’s Safe-Haven Appeal Beyond the RBNZ decision, global economic uncertainties are also playing a significant role in the NZD/USD dynamics. Escalating trade war concerns are bolstering the US Dollar’s safe-haven appeal, further contributing to the pressure on the NZD/USD pair. US President Donald Trump’s recent statements about potential auto tariffs, slated to begin as soon as April 2nd, have reignited fears of a global trade war. These protectionist measures, a recurring theme in his second term, tend to increase risk aversion in the markets. In times of heightened uncertainty, investors often flock to safe-haven assets like the US Dollar, driving up its value and consequently weighing on pairs like NZD/USD. Furthermore, the potential for the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to maintain its hawkish stance amidst persistent inflation adds another layer of support for the Greenback. If the Fed continues to signal its commitment to fighting inflation through interest rate hikes, it could create a divergence in monetary policy between the US and New Zealand, further strengthening the US Dollar relative to the NZD. RBNZ Monetary Policy: Key Concepts Explained To fully understand the implications of the RBNZ’s actions, it’s helpful to grasp some fundamental concepts of their monetary policy: Concept Description Impact on NZD Official Cash Rate (OCR) The RBNZ’s primary tool to influence inflation and employment. It’s the interest rate at which commercial banks borrow and lend overnight funds to each other. Higher OCR generally strengthens NZD; Lower OCR generally weakens NZD. Inflation Target (CPI) The RBNZ aims to keep inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), within a band of 1% to 3%. When inflation is above target, RBNZ tends to raise rates, supporting NZD. Maximum Sustainable Employment The highest level of employment achievable without causing accelerating inflation. RBNZ considers employment levels when setting interest rates. Strong employment can lead to rate hikes (NZD positive), while weak employment can lead to rate cuts (NZD negative). Quantitative Easing (QE) A last-resort monetary policy tool where the RBNZ buys assets to inject liquidity into the economy. Used in extreme situations like the COVID-19 pandemic. QE typically weakens the NZD. Navigating Currency Markets: Actionable Insights for Traders For traders navigating the current currency markets , particularly the NZD/USD pair, here are some actionable insights: Monitor RBNZ Communications Closely: Stay informed about any statements or hints from RBNZ officials leading up to and following the rate decision. Pay attention to press conferences, speeches, and official releases. Analyze Global Risk Sentiment: Keep an eye on global trade tensions and overall risk appetite. Increased risk aversion tends to favor the US Dollar and weigh on riskier currencies like the NZD. Watch US Economic Data: US economic data releases, particularly inflation figures and employment reports, can influence Fed policy expectations and consequently impact the US Dollar’s strength. Consider Technical Levels: Utilize technical analysis to identify key support and resistance levels for the NZD/USD pair. The 0.5700 level is currently a crucial area to watch. Manage Risk Prudently: Given the potential for volatility around the RBNZ decision, employ appropriate risk management strategies, such as using stop-loss orders and managing position sizes. Conclusion: Bracing for Volatility in NZD/USD The NZD/USD pair is poised for potential volatility as traders brace for the critical RBNZ rate decision. The widely anticipated interest rate cut, coupled with global trade uncertainties and a potentially hawkish Fed, creates a challenging environment for the New Zealand Dollar. Keep a close watch on the RBNZ’s announcements and Governor Orr’s commentary for clues about the future direction of the Kiwi.

This development arrives at a crucial juncture, as global markets closely monitor China’s economic strategies and their potential ripple effects across various sectors, including the cryptocurrency landscape. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, understanding these macroeconomic shifts is vital, as they can indirectly influence market sentiment and investment flows. Decoding China’s NDRC Policies for Private Firms The NDRC’s statement, released on Tuesday, emphasizes the favorable political, economic, and social climate currently prevailing for the growth of the private economy in China. This positive assessment sets the stage for a series of concrete actions designed to bolster private enterprises. Let’s break down the key takeaways from the NDRC’s announcement: Breaking Down Market Access Barriers: China is committed to further dismantling obstacles that hinder market access for private firms. This includes revising and introducing an updated version of the ‘negative list for market access’ promptly. This list specifies sectors where investment is restricted or prohibited, and a revised, shorter list would signify greater openness. Easing Financing Difficulties: Addressing a long-standing concern, the NDRC pledged to continue resolving the difficulties and high costs associated with financing for private enterprises. Access to affordable capital is crucial for the growth and innovation of private businesses, and measures to improve this will be closely watched. Accelerating Private Economy Promotion Law: To provide a stronger legal framework, preparations for the implementation of a private economy promotion law are being expedited. This law aims to safeguard the rights and interests of private businesses and foster a more predictable and supportive legal environment. Protecting Reputation: The NDRC vowed to resolutely crack down on actions that smear or defame the image and reputation of enterprises. This commitment aims to build trust and confidence in the private sector, encouraging fair competition and discouraging unfair practices. Opening Infrastructure Sectors: In a significant move, China will promote the fair opening of competitive areas within infrastructure and major national research infrastructure to private firms . This opens up new avenues for private sector participation in crucial areas of national development. Why These Policies Matter for the Crypto World While seemingly distant from the digital asset realm, China’s policies towards its private firms have indirect but significant implications for the cryptocurrency market. Here’s how: Policy Aspect Potential Crypto Market Impact Improved Business Environment A stronger private sector in China could lead to increased overall economic activity. This can boost investor confidence globally, potentially leading to more risk-on behavior, which can benefit crypto assets. Easier Access to Financing If financing conditions improve for Chinese private firms, it could free up capital and potentially increase investment appetite in various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, especially from Chinese investors looking for diversification. Market Access Reforms While not directly related to crypto exchanges (which remain restricted in China), broader market access reforms could signal a general trend towards greater economic openness. This sentiment can positively influence global market perceptions of China’s economic trajectory. Private Economy Promotion Law A robust legal framework supporting the private economy promotion law can foster a more predictable and stable business environment. Stability in major economies like China is generally viewed favorably by global markets, including crypto. Navigating the Nuances: Challenges and Opportunities While the NDRC’s announcements are undoubtedly positive, the actual implementation and impact of these NDRC policies will be crucial. Some challenges and opportunities to consider: Implementation Speed: The effectiveness of these policies hinges on how quickly and efficiently they are implemented at the local level. Delays or bureaucratic hurdles could dampen the intended positive effects. Global Economic Context: The global economic landscape, including inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical tensions, will also play a significant role in shaping the outcomes of these policies. External factors can influence the overall investment climate, regardless of domestic policy efforts. Investor Sentiment: Ultimately, the success of these policies will depend on how they are perceived by investors, both domestic and international. Positive sentiment and renewed confidence in China’s private firms are essential for translating policy pronouncements into tangible economic gains. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors For those involved in the cryptocurrency market, here are some actionable insights based on these developments: Monitor Implementation: Keep a close watch on the practical implementation of these NDRC policies . Look for concrete evidence of improved market access, easier financing, and the strengthening of the legal framework for private firms. Assess Market Sentiment: Gauge how these policies are impacting overall market sentiment towards Chinese assets and the broader Asian economy. Positive sentiment can create favorable conditions for crypto investments. Consider Indirect Effects: Recognize the indirect channels through which these policies can influence the crypto market. Improved economic stability and investor confidence in China can have positive spillover effects on global risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of further announcements and policy adjustments from the NDRC and other Chinese government bodies. Macroeconomic policy shifts in major economies like China are crucial indicators for global financial markets. Conclusion: A Promising Sign for China’s Private Sector China’s NDRC’s commitment to implementing ‘precise’ policies to support China private firms is a welcome development. By focusing on easing financing difficulties, improving market access , and strengthening the legal environment, these measures aim to unleash the dynamism of the private sector. While the direct impact on the cryptocurrency market may be indirect, the broader macroeconomic implications are undeniable. A thriving Chinese private sector can contribute to global economic stability and potentially create a more favorable environment for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. The world will be watching closely to see how these policies unfold and the extent to which they empower China’s private firms and influence the global economic landscape.

40523404,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=130162,1739933074,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Japanese Yen’s Resilience: Drifting Lower, Yet Poised for a Powerful Rebound?",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/yen-resilience-bullish-rebound-potential/,"In the ever-turbulent world of cryptocurrency and forex trading, understanding the nuances of global currencies is paramount. Today, we’re diving deep into the intriguing movements of the Japanese Yen (JPY). Despite a recent dip fueled by receding safe-haven demand, the Yen’s underlying bullish potential remains firmly intact. Let’s explore the factors at play and what they mean for traders navigating these complex markets. Why is the Japanese Yen Drifting Lower Right Now? The Japanese Yen has experienced a slight retreat, moving away from a one-week high against the US Dollar. This downward drift is primarily attributed to a decrease in its safe-haven appeal. But what exactly does this mean? Reduced Safe-Haven Demand: Investor sentiment plays a huge role in currency valuations. Recently, optimism has increased due to a delay in US President Trump’s proposed reciprocal tariffs and hopes for progress in US-Russia talks regarding the Ukraine conflict. This positive shift in global sentiment reduces the demand for traditional safe-haven assets like the Japanese Yen , leading to a temporary weakening. Modest US Dollar Uptick: Concurrently, we’ve seen a slight strengthening of the US Dollar (USD), further contributing to the USD/JPY pair’s modest recovery from recent lows. However, it’s crucial to understand that this current weakness may be short-lived. The fundamental factors supporting a stronger Yen are still very much in play. The Bullish Case for the Japanese Yen: Why the Dip Might Be a Buying Opportunity Despite the current downward drift, numerous factors suggest that the Japanese Yen retains significant bullish potential. Let’s delve into these key drivers: Rising Expectations of a BoJ Rate Hike The Bank of Japan (BoJ) is under increasing pressure to adjust its ultra-loose monetary policy. Robust economic data from Japan is fueling speculation about imminent interest rate hikes. Here’s why this is critical for the Yen: Strong Q4 GDP Growth: Japan’s impressive Q4 GDP figures, released on Monday, have solidified expectations for policy tightening by the BoJ. This positive economic momentum strengthens the case for higher interest rates. Market Pricing in Rate Hikes: Financial markets are now pricing in approximately 37 basis points of rate increases by the BoJ before the end of the year. This anticipation itself provides upward pressure on the Yen. Japanese Government Bond Yields Surge: Hawkish BoJ expectations have driven Japanese government bond yields to multi-year highs. The benchmark 10-year JGB yield has reached its highest level since April 2010, making Japanese bonds more attractive to investors and supporting the Yen. A BoJ rate hike would mark a significant shift away from years of ultra-loose monetary policy, making the Yen more attractive to global investors seeking yield. Narrowing US-Japan Yield Differential: A Tailwind for JPY The yield differential between US and Japanese bonds is another crucial factor influencing the USD/JPY pair. For years, a wide gap favored the US Dollar, but this dynamic is shifting: US Treasury Yields Decline: Expectations of Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate cuts in the US, potentially as early as September or October, have caused US Treasury bond yields to decline. Fed Rate Cut Expectations: Despite mixed signals from Fed officials, Fed Funds Futures are pricing in a 40 basis point rate cut in the US in 2025. This expectation further compresses US Treasury yields. Impact on USD/JPY: The narrowing yield differential reduces the attractiveness of holding US Dollar assets relative to Japanese Yen assets. This diminished yield advantage for the USD can limit aggressive bearish bets against the lower-yielding JPY and potentially strengthen the Yen. Essentially, as the gap in interest rates between the US and Japan shrinks, the incentive to hold USD over JPY diminishes, providing support for the Japanese Yen . Technical Outlook for USD/JPY: Is a Rebound Imminent? From a technical analysis perspective, the USD/JPY chart reveals some interesting signals: Bearish Signals Prevail: Last week’s failure to break above the 50% retracement level of the January-February downtrend, coupled with a drop below the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), suggests that bearish momentum is currently dominant. Oscillators in Negative Territory: Daily chart oscillators remain in negative territory, reinforcing the view that the path of least resistance for USD/JPY is still downwards. Resistance Levels to Watch: Any upward movement towards the 152.00 mark is likely to encounter selling pressure. Key resistance levels include: 152.00: Psychological level and potential selling zone. 152.65: 200-day SMA, acting as significant resistance. 153.15: 100-day SMA, further resistance level. Support Levels to Monitor: On the downside, immediate support lies at the 151.25 area (Asian session low), followed by: 151.00-150.90: Year-to-date trough, a crucial support zone. 150.00: Psychological level, strong support. 149.60-149.55: Region offering further support. 149.00: Round figure support. 148.65: December 2024 swing low, a significant long-term support level. USD/JPY Key Technical Levels: Resistance Levels Support Levels 152.00, 152.65, 153.15 151.25, 151.00-150.90, 150.00, 149.60-149.55, 149.00, 148.65 For traders, it’s prudent to wait for a strong break above the resistance levels before confirming a bottom in USD/JPY and positioning for a sustained recovery. Conversely, a break below the support levels could signal further downside. Navigating the Japanese Yen: FAQs for Crypto and Forex Traders Understanding the nuances of the Japanese Yen is crucial for informed trading decisions. Here are some frequently asked questions: What key factors drive the Japanese Yen’s value? The Japanese Yen’s value is influenced by a combination of factors, including: Japanese Economic Performance: Overall economic health and growth prospects. Bank of Japan (BoJ) Policy: Monetary policy decisions, interest rate adjustments, and interventions in currency markets. US-Japan Bond Yield Differential: The difference in yields between US and Japanese government bonds. Global Risk Sentiment: Investor appetite for risk; in times of uncertainty, the Yen often acts as a safe haven. How do BoJ decisions impact the Japanese Yen? The BoJ’s monetary policy is a primary driver of the Japanese Yen’s value. Key impacts include: Currency Control Mandate: The BoJ actively manages the Yen’s value, sometimes intervening directly in currency markets. Ultra-Loose Policy (2013-2024): Prolonged low interest rates weakened the Yen due to policy divergence with other central banks. Policy Shift: The gradual unwinding of ultra-loose policy is now providing support to the Yen. How does the US-Japan bond yield differential affect the Japanese Yen? The yield differential is a significant driver, particularly in recent years: Widening Divergence (Past Decade): BoJ’s ultra-loose policy widened the yield gap with the US Fed, favoring the US Dollar. Narrowing Differential (Current Trend): BoJ policy adjustments and potential Fed rate cuts are narrowing this gap, supporting the Yen. How does risk sentiment impact the Japanese Yen? The Japanese Yen’s safe-haven status is crucial during times of market stress: Safe-Haven Asset: Investors flock to the Yen during uncertainty due to its perceived stability. Turbulent Times: Geopolitical instability or economic downturns typically strengthen the Yen against riskier currencies. Tariffs and Trade: A Quick Guide for Context The mention of US President Trump’s tariffs in the news snippet highlights the broader global economic context influencing currency markets. Here’s a brief overview of tariffs: What are tariffs? Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods. Key aspects include: Customs Duties: Levied on specific imported merchandise. Protectionist Tool: Designed to make domestic producers more competitive by increasing the price of imports. Trade Barriers: Used alongside other trade restrictions like quotas. Tariffs vs. Taxes: What’s the difference? While both generate government revenue, tariffs and taxes differ in several ways: Feature Tariffs Taxes Payment Timing Prepaid at port of entry Paid at time of purchase Payer Importers Taxpayers and businesses Are tariffs good or bad for the economy? Economists hold differing views on tariffs: Pro-Tariff Argument: Protection of domestic industries, correction of trade imbalances. Anti-Tariff Argument: Potential for higher prices, risk of trade wars through retaliatory tariffs. Trump’s Tariff Plan: What to know? President Trump’s tariff proposals are significant for global trade: Focus on Major Importers: Targeting countries like Mexico, China, and Canada, which are major sources of US imports. Revenue for Tax Cuts: Intention to use tariff revenue to reduce personal income taxes. Conclusion: Japanese Yen – A Sleeping Bull? The Japanese Yen is currently experiencing a temporary dip, influenced by shifting risk sentiment and a modest USD rebound. However, the underlying bullish factors remain robust. Rising expectations of a BoJ rate hike , coupled with a narrowing US-Japan yield differential , suggest that the Yen’s current weakness may be a transient phase. For astute traders, this could represent a strategic opportunity to position for a potential powerful rebound in the Japanese Yen as fundamental tailwinds reassert themselves.

All eyes are glued to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) as they gear up for their first monetary policy announcement of 2025. Whispers in the market suggest a significant move – an anticipated RBA interest rate cut . But what does this mean for the Australian economy, the Australian Dollar , and your trading strategies? Let’s dive deep into the details and uncover what to expect. Decoding the Expected RBA Interest Rate Cut The financial world is buzzing with anticipation of a 25 basis points (bps) cut to the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by the RBA. After holding steady at 4.35% since November 2023, the pressure is mounting. Why the shift? Stubbornly high inflation and a slowing economy are pushing policymakers to act. But is this just the beginning of a series of cuts? Let’s break down the key factors influencing this pivotal decision: Easing Inflation: The good news is that Australian core inflation showed signs of cooling down in the last quarter of 2024. While still above the RBA’s target range, the deceleration is a crucial factor fueling rate cut expectations. The Trimmed Mean CPI, the RBA’s preferred inflation gauge, came in lower than anticipated, suggesting progress in taming price pressures. Economic Slowdown Concerns: Sluggish economic growth is becoming a major headache. The persistent high interest rates are squeezing households and businesses, impacting overall economic activity. A rate cut could be seen as a necessary stimulus to reignite growth. Strong Employment Data – A Complicating Factor: Here’s the twist – Australia’s employment growth remains robust. Annual employment growth actually strengthened, reaching its highest rate since October 2023. This positive employment data throws a wrench in the works, potentially making the RBA hesitant to aggressively cut rates. Australia Interest Rates : A Balancing Act for the RBA The RBA is walking a tightrope. They need to address the inflation issue, but they also can’t ignore the signs of economic slowdown. The December meeting minutes revealed a nuanced stance. While acknowledging eased upside inflation risks, officials also noted they were only “gaining some confidence” that inflation was moving towards the 2-3% target. Governor Michele Bullock herself highlighted that while rate cuts weren’t off the table, neither were rate hikes, emphasizing a cautious approach. Market sentiment currently leans towards a rate cut, but the prevailing expectation is that the RBA will proceed cautiously. This suggests a slow and measured approach to monetary easing rather than a rapid series of cuts. The RBA’s challenge lies in calibrating Australia interest rates to both manage inflation and support economic growth without triggering unwanted consequences. Monetary Policy Outlook : Clues from the RBA Announcement The real drama unfolds after the RBA interest rate cut announcement. The market’s reaction will heavily depend on the accompanying statement and Governor Bullock’s press conference. Traders and investors will be hanging on every word, searching for clues about the future monetary policy outlook . Key questions on everyone’s mind include: Is this a one-off cut, or the start of a easing cycle? The RBA’s forward guidance will be critical. Any hints of further cuts will have a significant impact. How concerned is the RBA about economic growth? The tone of the statement will reveal the RBA’s priorities – inflation control versus growth support. What are the RBA’s inflation forecasts? Updated forecasts will provide insights into the RBA’s confidence in achieving its inflation target. Australian Dollar (AUD/USD) : Navigating the Forex Seas How will the Australian Dollar (AUD/USD) pair react to the RBA’s decision? A 25 bps rate cut is largely priced in, so the immediate impact might be muted. However, the devil is in the details. Potential AUD/USD Scenarios: RBA Announcement Potential AUD/USD Reaction Explanation 25 bps cut, hawkish statement (hints at no further cuts soon) Potential AUD strength or limited weakness A “hawkish cut” could be interpreted positively as the RBA remains cautious about further easing. 25 bps cut, neutral statement Moderate AUD weakness Expected cut, limited surprise factor. 25 bps cut, dovish statement (hints at more cuts coming) Significant AUD weakness Signifies a shift towards a more aggressive easing cycle. 50 bps cut (unexpected) Sharp AUD sell-off A larger-than-expected cut would be a major dovish surprise. No rate cut (unexpected) Potential AUD spike Markets are heavily positioned for a cut, so no cut would be a hawkish surprise. Valeria Bednarik, Chief Analyst at Bitcoin World, notes the technical setup for AUD/USD: “The AUD/USD pair peaked at 0.6373 ahead of the announcement, its highest since mid-December. Technically, the pair has scope to extend its advance towards the 0.6470 region, but a dovish outcome could push it through the 0.6300 threshold.” She also highlights the uncertainty surrounding US tariffs and their potential impact on the Australian economy as a factor the RBA might consider. RBA FAQs: Understanding the Fundamentals Let’s clarify some key concepts related to the RBA and its influence on the Australian Dollar : What is the Reserve Bank of Australia and how does it influence the Australian Dollar? The RBA is Australia’s central bank, responsible for setting interest rates and managing monetary policy. Its primary goal is price stability (2-3% inflation), but it also aims to contribute to currency stability, full employment, and economic prosperity. Interest rate adjustments are its main tool – higher rates tend to strengthen the AUD, and lower rates weaken it. How does inflation data impact the value of the Australian Dollar? In modern finance, moderate inflation can actually be positive for a currency. It often leads central banks to raise interest rates, attracting foreign capital seeking higher returns. This increased demand strengthens the local currency, like the Aussie Dollar. How does economic data influence the value of the Australian Dollar? Strong economic data signals a healthy and growing economy, attracting investment. Indicators like GDP, PMIs, employment figures, and consumer sentiment can all impact the AUD. Positive data may encourage the RBA to raise rates, further supporting the currency. What is Quantitative Easing (QE) and how does it affect the Australian Dollar? QE is an unconventional tool used in crises. The RBA prints AUD to buy assets (usually bonds) from financial institutions, injecting liquidity. QE typically weakens the AUD. What is Quantitative tightening (QT) and how does it affect the Australian Dollar? QT is the reverse of QE, used during economic recovery to combat rising inflation. The RBA stops buying assets and reinvesting bond principal. QT is generally positive for the AUD. Economic Indicator: RBA Interest Rate Decision The RBA announces its interest rate decision after scheduled meetings. Hawkish stances and rate hikes are usually bullish for the AUD, while dovish views, unchanged rates, or cuts are bearish.

The AUD/JPY pair is currently at a crucial juncture, testing a nine-day support level below 96.50. All eyes are glued to the upcoming Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) policy decision, expected later today. Will the RBA’s anticipated rate cut send the Aussie Dollar tumbling further against the Yen? Let’s dive into the technical analysis and market expectations to understand what could be next for this popular currency pair. AUD/JPY Forecast: Navigating the 96.50 Support Level The AUD/JPY pair is currently dancing around the 96.40 mark during Tuesday’s Asian trading session, attempting a recovery after recent losses. However, this recovery attempt is fragile as the pair grapples with immediate support at the nine-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently around 96.34. This level is proving to be a critical near-term battleground. Adding to the bearish sentiment, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains below the 50 level, hovering in negative territory. This indicator suggests that bearish momentum is still in play, potentially signaling further downside pressure on the AUD/JPY. On the upside, the path of resistance appears to be capped by the descending channel’s upper boundary, looming around the 97.00 level. This channel pattern, visible on the daily chart, reinforces the overall bearish bias in the medium term. RBA Policy Decision: The Key Catalyst for AUD/JPY Traders are holding their breath in anticipation of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) policy decision. The central bank is widely expected to announce a 25 basis points (bps) cut to its Official Cash Rate (OCR), bringing it down to 4.10%. This would mark the first rate cut in four years, a significant shift in monetary policy. Here’s what market participants are expecting from the RBA: Rate Cut Expectation: A 25 bps cut is almost fully priced in by the markets. Forward Guidance: The focus will be on the RBA’s statement and Governor Bullock’s press conference for clues about future policy moves. Will this be the start of a series of cuts, or a one-off adjustment? Market Reaction: The AUD/JPY, and the Australian Dollar in general, is likely to react strongly to the RBA’s announcement and forward guidance. A dovish tone could trigger further AUD weakness. Technical Analysis: Decoding the AUD/JPY Chart A closer look at the daily chart reveals that the AUD/JPY is trading within a descending channel pattern. This technical formation typically suggests a prevailing bearish trend. Let’s break down the key technical levels to watch: Key Technical Indicators: Descending Channel: The pair is confined within a descending channel, indicating a bearish bias. 14-day RSI: Below 50, reinforcing bearish momentum. 9-day EMA: Currently acting as immediate support around 96.34, but neutrality is suggested as price hovers around it. 50-day EMA: Located at 97.18, acting as a significant resistance level above the descending channel’s upper boundary. Critical Price Levels: Level Type Price Level Significance Immediate Support 96.34 (9-day EMA) Break below could accelerate losses Next Support 94.37 Five-month low (Feb 10) Further Support 93.59 Six-month low (Sep 11) Channel Bottom Support Around 93.50 Strong support zone Immediate Resistance 97.00 Descending channel upper boundary Key Resistance 97.18 50-day EMA Major Resistance 98.77 Six-week high (Jan 24) Australian Dollar (AUD) Strength Today Despite the bearish technical outlook for AUD/JPY, it’s worth noting the Australian Dollar’s performance against other major currencies today. As per the table below, the AUD is showing relative strength against some pairs, particularly the New Zealand Dollar. Australian Dollar PRICE Today USD EUR GBP JPY CAD AUD NZD CHF USD 0.15% 0.17% 0.26% 0.07% 0.24% 0.47% 0.09% EUR -0.15% 0.02% 0.11% -0.08% 0.10% 0.32% -0.06% GBP -0.17% -0.02% 0.10% -0.10% 0.08% 0.30% -0.08% JPY -0.26% -0.11% -0.10% -0.19% -0.02% 0.19% -0.18% CAD -0.07% 0.08% 0.10% 0.19% 0.17% 0.40% 0.02% AUD -0.24% -0.10% -0.08% 0.02% -0.17% 0.22% -0.16% NZD -0.47% -0.32% -0.30% -0.19% -0.40% -0.22% -0.37% CHF -0.09% 0.06% 0.08% 0.18% -0.02% 0.16% 0.37% Note: The table shows percentage changes of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today. This relative strength suggests that while AUD/JPY faces specific pressures, the Australian Dollar isn’t universally weak. However, the looming RBA decision is the dominant factor for the AUD/JPY pair. Concluding Thoughts: Brace for Volatility Post-RBA The AUD/JPY is delicately poised ahead of the RBA policy decision. The 96.50 support level is under intense scrutiny, and a break below this could open the door for a test of lower levels, potentially towards the 94.37 five-month low. Conversely, a surprise hawkish tilt from the RBA, although unlikely, or a weaker-than-expected Yen, could trigger a bullish reversal, targeting the 97.00-97.18 resistance zone. For Forex traders, this means heightened volatility is expected in the AUD/JPY pair during and after the RBA announcement. Careful risk management and monitoring of price action around key technical levels will be crucial in navigating potential trading opportunities.

PS Plus Extra subscribers will access Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, Mordhau, SaGa Frontier Remastered, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Top Spin 2K25, Somerville, and Tin Hearts. The games are available for gamers with PS4 and PS5 consoles. PS Plus Premium subscribers will access Patapon 3 and Dropship: United Peace Force, available on PSP and PS2, respectively.

The 6-player survival game Abiotic Factor from Deep Field Games and Playstack will also come to the Game Catalog this summer.

The gaming company also highlighted that canceling membership and subscribing afterward would not work for gamers who had already subscribed to the two subscription plans. Many gamers still found the discounts unfair. A Reddit thread revealed the thoughts of the gaming community, where some commenters believed that the discounts did not make sense. Others also believed that Sony had been unfair in PS Plus discount offerings for several years. Sony shreds 10 games from the PS Plus Game Catalog Last chance to play got updated.

Sony further discontinued 11 titles on January 14, including Legend of Mana, Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection, Life Is Strange, Life is Strange: Before the Storm, and Just Cause 3.

The move permits institutional investors to buy tokenized shares of the fund with U.S. dollars or stablecoins like as ( USDC ) USDC and USDT ( USDT ), according to Bloomberg . The Invesco private credit fund primarily invests in senior secured loans and has delivered a 4.5% annual net yield since its inception in 2006, DigiFT CEO Henry Zhang said. Unlike most tokenized private credit funds, which have long redemption cycles, this fund will offer daily liquidity, making it a more flexible option for investors. Tokenization, the process of converting conventional assets into digital representations on the blockchain, is expanding quickly. 80% of real-world assets that are currently on-chain are private credit, which is driving this trend, according to rwa.xyz.

The asset manager estimates that tokenized funds could manage up to $600 billion by 2030, representing 1% of the total assets in mutual and exchange-traded funds. DigiFT, already a key player in the tokenization space, recently became the first distribution partner for UBS’s uMint, a tokenized money market fund. The platform is subject to Singaporean regulations and is licensed as a market operator and capital markets entity. Settlements for DigiFT’s tokenized Invesco fund will take up to five days, despite the fact that redemptions are available every day. While liquidity providers manage the underlying settlement process, Zhang disclosed plans to launch an on-chain liquidity pool that would enable investors to rapidly redeem tokens at a little discount. With prominent asset managers like Franklin Templeton and BlackRock adopting tokenization, DigiFT’s most recent action highlights how blockchain is increasingly being used in TradFi.

Is It Poised to Be the Next $100M Crypto Leader?,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-whales-dive-into-web3bay-is-it-poised-to-be-the-next-100m-crypto-leader/,"Web3Bay is quickly making a name for itself by offering a decentralized alternative to traditional e-commerce platforms. In contrast to centralized giants like Amazon and eBay, which dominate with high fees and unilateral transaction control, Web3Bay leverages blockchain technology for facilitating direct peer-to-peer transactions. This shift not only secures transactions but also slashes the cost of transacting, enhancing user autonomy. As of February 18, 2025, the platform’s presale has successfully garnered over $1.4 million and sold more than 350 million tokens. Currently, in Stage 4, the 3BAY token is priced at $0.004562625, with an anticipated launch price of $0.1959, suggesting a potential 4,200% gain for early backers. The presale’s structured 28-stage approach, with each stage offering a 15% price hike, is designed to boost early engagement and has evidently resonated well within the investment community, signaling strong confidence in Web3Bay’s capacity to transform the global e-commerce landscape. What Draws Venture Capitalists & Crypto Whales to Invest? Web3Bay’s presale velocity is substantially fueled by the active participation of venture capitalists and crypto whales, who are betting big on the project’s future. A key allure is Web3Bay’s potential to disrupt the e-commerce sector, a behemoth valued at $6 trillion yet plagued by centralization. Traditional platforms impose strict seller conditions, hefty fees, and wield control over user data. By removing these impediments through a blockchain-based model, Web3Bay hands power back to the users, presenting a groundbreaking shift in online buying and selling dynamics. This paradigm shift is viewed by investors as a lucrative, long-term investment. The high potential for return on investment (ROI) during the early presale phases also attracts substantial capital, with projections showing token prices spiking to $0.1959 at launch. Early participants could witness substantial financial gains. Moreover, the involvement of institutional investors and prominent crypto figures lends further legitimacy, as such entities typically back projects with solid fundamentals and sustainable value. Another standout feature of Web3Bay is its commitment to security and transaction transparency. E-commerce is often riddled with fraud and disputes; Web3Bay addresses these issues with smart contracts and decentralized identity verification, ensuring reliable and open transactions, thus positioning itself as a superior choice to conventional marketplaces. Comparative Market Analysis & Prospective Insights While numerous crypto ventures lean towards speculative trading, Web3Bay offers tangible real-world applications. In contrast to blockchain projects like Solana and Cardano, which focus on enhancing blockchain scalability, Web3Bay targets the practical needs of the e-commerce industry. Ethereum, despite its widespread adoption, suffers from high transaction fees, rendering it less suitable for minor transactions. Conversely, Web3Bay presents a cost-effective solution tailored for e-commerce. Unlike NFT platforms such as OpenSea and Blur, which are geared towards digital assets, Web3Bay broadens blockchain’s applicability to physical goods and services. With a robust presale backed by significant investments from whales and venture capital, Web3Bay is poised for a bright future. It addresses core e-commerce challenges while offering investors substantial growth potential. As the presale continues and adoption increases, Web3Bay is well-positioned to become the premier decentralized marketplace, revolutionizing the trade of goods and services online. For investors looking for practical utility and significant expansion potential, Web3Bay emerges as an exceptional choice.

The usually vibrant world of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing a noticeable shift. Recent reports indicate a significant downturn in capital flowing into these leading cryptocurrencies. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez dropped a bombshell on X, revealing a startling statistic: capital inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum have plummeted by over 30% in the past month alone. This dramatic decrease, shrinking from a robust $45 billion to a more modest $30 billion, raises crucial questions about the current state of the crypto market and what it means for investors like you. Understanding the Dip in Bitcoin Capital Inflows Let’s unpack what this Bitcoin capital inflows decrease actually signifies. Capital inflow, in simple terms, represents the money flowing into an asset – in this case, Bitcoin and Ethereum. A reduction in this flow can be influenced by a multitude of factors, and it often serves as a key indicator of investor sentiment and market momentum. Why is this happening now? Several potential factors could be at play: Market Correction: After periods of significant gains, markets often experience corrections. Investors might be taking profits, leading to reduced new capital entering the market. Regulatory Uncertainty: Ongoing regulatory discussions and actions globally can create uncertainty, prompting investors to become more cautious and potentially reducing Bitcoin capital inflows . Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions like inflation, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical events can influence investor risk appetite, impacting investments in volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Alternative Investment Opportunities: The emergence of new investment avenues, within or outside the crypto space, could be diverting capital away from Bitcoin and Ethereum. To put this into perspective, consider the following table illustrating the capital inflow trend: Cryptocurrency Capital Inflow (Previous Month) Capital Inflow (Current Month) Change Bitcoin (BTC) & Ethereum (ETH) Combined $45 Billion $30 Billion -33.3% Ethereum Capital Inflows Mirror Bitcoin’s Downtrend Just like Bitcoin, Ethereum capital inflows are also experiencing a significant contraction. This parallel movement suggests a broader market sentiment shift rather than an isolated issue affecting only one cryptocurrency. Ethereum, often seen as the backbone of the decentralized web and DeFi, usually attracts substantial investment. A 30% drop here is equally noteworthy and warrants close attention. The reasons mirroring Bitcoin’s decline could be amplified by Ethereum-specific factors: Post-Merge Consolidation: Following the successful Merge, the initial excitement might be subsiding, leading to a period of consolidation and potentially reduced immediate Ethereum capital inflows . Competition from Layer-2 Solutions: The growth of Layer-2 scaling solutions on Ethereum, while beneficial for the ecosystem, could temporarily redistribute capital flows within the Ethereum network, potentially impacting direct inflows into ETH itself. DeFi Market Dynamics: Fluctuations in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) market, heavily reliant on Ethereum, can directly impact investor confidence and consequently, Ethereum capital inflows . Impact on the Crypto Market: Is This a Cause for Concern? The combined decrease in crypto market capital inflows for Bitcoin and Ethereum naturally raises concerns about the overall health and direction of the cryptocurrency market. While a 30% drop is substantial, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. The crypto market is known for its volatility and cyclical nature. Dips and corrections are not uncommon and can even be healthy for long-term growth by shaking out excessive speculation and allowing for more sustainable market foundations. However, this downturn should not be dismissed lightly. Sustained reduced inflows could potentially lead to: Price Corrections: Reduced demand due to lower capital inflows can exert downward pressure on prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and potentially other cryptocurrencies. Reduced Liquidity: Lower inflows can decrease market liquidity, making it potentially more challenging to execute large trades without impacting prices significantly. Shift in Investor Sentiment: Prolonged periods of reduced inflows can negatively impact overall investor sentiment, leading to a more cautious or even bearish market outlook. Investment Trends: Navigating the Current Waters For investors, understanding these investment trends is paramount. A decrease in capital inflows doesn’t necessarily signal the end of the crypto bull run, but it does serve as a crucial signal to reassess strategies and exercise caution. Here are some actionable insights for navigating this phase: Diversification: Now, more than ever, diversification is key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Explore different asset classes and diversify within the crypto space itself. Due Diligence: Thorough research and due diligence are essential. Understand the projects you invest in and stay updated on market developments. Risk Management: Implement robust risk management strategies. Determine your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Consider using stop-loss orders and portfolio rebalancing techniques. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that cryptocurrency investments are often long-term plays. Short-term fluctuations are part of the game. Focus on the long-term potential and fundamentals of your chosen assets. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory updates, and macroeconomic trends that can influence the crypto market. Crypto Analysis: What Does the Future Hold? Expert crypto analysis of these capital inflow trends suggests a period of market recalibration. While the 30% drop is significant, it could also be a temporary phase within a larger growth cycle. The crypto market is still relatively young and prone to significant swings. The long-term trajectory will likely depend on factors such as: Institutional Adoption: Continued institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies remains a critical driver for sustained growth. Technological Advancements: Ongoing technological developments and innovations within the blockchain and crypto space will shape future market trends. Regulatory Clarity: Increased regulatory clarity and supportive frameworks from governments worldwide will be crucial for mainstream adoption and attracting further capital inflows. In conclusion, the 30% drop in capital inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum is a noteworthy development demanding attention. It signals a potential shift in market dynamics and underscores the importance of informed investment strategies. While it may induce caution, it also presents an opportunity for strategic investors to reassess, adapt, and position themselves for the next phase of the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Stay informed, stay vigilant, and navigate these waters with wisdom.

40524030,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=130198,1739934336,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial ESMA Guidelines: Landmark Crypto Regulation for Crypto Firm Competence,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/esma-guidelines-crypto-firm-competence/,"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, regulatory clarity is paramount. For crypto businesses operating in Europe, a significant development is on the horizon. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU’s financial watchdog, has just dropped a bombshell – proposed guidelines aimed at ensuring the crypto firm competence of staff within crypto asset service providers. This move, aligning with the landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation, signals a new era of accountability and professionalism in the crypto space. Let’s dive into what these guidelines entail and what they mean for the future of crypto businesses and professionals. Why is Crypto Firm Competence Suddenly a Hot Topic? The explosive growth of the cryptocurrency market has brought immense opportunities, but also significant risks. From market volatility to complex technological underpinnings, and the ever-present threat of financial crime, the crypto landscape demands a high level of expertise. Regulators worldwide are increasingly concerned about investor protection and market integrity. The EU, through MiCA, is taking a proactive stance, and ESMA’s proposed guidelines on crypto firm competence are a crucial step in operationalizing this regulation. But why now? Consider these factors: Investor Protection Imperative: As more retail investors enter the crypto market, ensuring they are dealing with knowledgeable and ethical professionals becomes vital. Incompetent staff can lead to mis-selling, poor advice, and ultimately, financial losses for investors. Market Stability Concerns: Lack of expertise within crypto firms can contribute to market instability. Understanding market operations, pricing mechanisms, and risk management is essential for maintaining a stable and efficient crypto ecosystem. Combating Financial Crime: The crypto space, unfortunately, has been targeted by illicit activities. Staff with a deep understanding of regulatory frameworks, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) obligations are crucial in preventing and detecting financial crime. Technological Complexity: Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are inherently complex. Staff need to grasp these intricacies to provide informed services and navigate the technical challenges of the industry. Global Regulatory Pressure: International bodies and national regulators are increasingly focusing on crypto regulation. The EU’s move is part of a global trend towards establishing clear standards and frameworks for the crypto industry. Decoding the ESMA Guidelines: What Skills are in Demand? ESMA’s proposed guidelines are not just about ticking boxes; they aim to foster genuine expertise within crypto firms. The regulator has outlined specific areas of knowledge and skills that staff should possess. Let’s break down the key components of crypto firm competence as defined by ESMA: Area of Competence Description Why it Matters Crypto Risks Understanding Knowledge of the inherent risks associated with crypto assets, including market volatility, technological vulnerabilities, cybersecurity threats, and regulatory risks. Essential for risk management, investor education, and responsible service provision. Market Operations Expertise Understanding how crypto markets function, including trading mechanisms, order book dynamics, market participants, and liquidity considerations. Crucial for fair pricing, efficient trading, and preventing market manipulation. Pricing and Valuation Knowledge Ability to analyze crypto asset pricing, understand valuation methodologies, and identify factors influencing price movements. Important for providing investment advice, managing portfolios, and ensuring fair pricing practices. Blockchain Technology Proficiency Solid grasp of blockchain technology, its underlying principles, different types of blockchains, and their applications in crypto assets. Necessary for understanding the technical aspects of crypto assets, assessing project viability, and navigating technological developments. Regulatory Frameworks Mastery Comprehensive knowledge of relevant regulations, including MiCA, AML/CTF directives, data protection laws, and consumer protection regulations. Fundamental for compliance, legal operations, and ensuring ethical business practices. Tax Implications Awareness Understanding the tax implications of crypto assets, including income tax, capital gains tax, VAT, and reporting obligations in relevant jurisdictions. Vital for providing accurate tax information to clients and ensuring tax compliance for the firm. These competency areas are not just theoretical. They translate into practical skills needed for various roles within crypto firms, from customer service representatives to compliance officers and portfolio managers. ESMA’s guidelines emphasize that the level of competence required should be proportionate to the role and responsibilities of the staff member. What are the Implications of These ESMA Guidelines? The proposed guidelines on ESMA guidelines for staff competence are poised to have a far-reaching impact on the crypto industry in Europe. Here are some key implications: Elevated Industry Standards: These guidelines will likely drive up the professional standards within the crypto industry. Firms will need to invest in training and development to ensure their staff meets the required competency levels. Increased Compliance Burden: Crypto asset service providers will face a greater compliance burden as they implement processes to assess and maintain staff competence. This could involve developing internal training programs, conducting competency assessments, and maintaining records of staff qualifications. Competitive Advantage for Compliant Firms: Firms that proactively embrace these guidelines and prioritize staff competence may gain a competitive advantage. Investors and partners are likely to favor firms that demonstrate a commitment to professionalism and regulatory compliance. Enhanced Investor Trust: By ensuring staff competence, these guidelines aim to build greater investor trust in the crypto market. Knowing that professionals within crypto firms are knowledgeable and qualified can boost investor confidence and encourage wider adoption. Potential for Industry Consolidation: The increased compliance burden and the need for investment in training could lead to some consolidation within the crypto industry. Smaller firms may find it challenging to meet the new requirements, potentially leading to mergers or acquisitions by larger, better-resourced players. Navigating the Future of Crypto Regulation and Competence The release of these proposed crypto regulation guidelines marks a significant step towards a more mature and regulated crypto market in Europe. While the guidelines are still in the consultation phase – with feedback being gathered until April 22nd and final guidelines expected in the third quarter – crypto firms should start preparing now. Here are some actionable insights: Assess Current Staff Competence: Firms should conduct a thorough assessment of the current competence levels of their staff across the areas outlined by ESMA. Identify any gaps in knowledge and skills. Develop Training Programs: Based on the competency assessment, develop targeted training programs to address identified gaps. These programs should cover the key areas of knowledge and skills highlighted in the ESMA guidelines. Implement Competency Assessment Processes: Establish ongoing processes for assessing and maintaining staff competence. This could involve regular training, knowledge tests, performance reviews, and professional development requirements. Stay Informed and Engage with Regulators: Keep abreast of regulatory developments, including the final ESMA guidelines and any updates to MiCA. Engage with industry associations and regulators to stay informed and contribute to the evolving regulatory landscape. Prioritize a Culture of Compliance and Professionalism: Foster a company culture that prioritizes compliance, ethical conduct, and continuous professional development. This is not just about meeting regulatory requirements; it’s about building a sustainable and reputable crypto business. Conclusion: A New Era of Professionalism in Crypto ESMA’s proposed guidelines on MiCA regulation and staff competence are a clear signal: the era of the Wild West in crypto is coming to an end in Europe. These guidelines are not just about regulation; they are about fostering a more professional, trustworthy, and sustainable crypto ecosystem. By prioritizing staff competence, the EU is taking a proactive approach to investor protection, market integrity, and responsible innovation. For crypto businesses, embracing these changes is not just about compliance – it’s about building a foundation for long-term success in a rapidly evolving industry.

Grassley also pointed out that Elon’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) has the full backing of President Donald Trump. The mass firings across federal agencies, which have already gutted regulatory bodies and watchdog organizations, are an executive branch decision, Grassley explained . “The Constitution says all executive power of the federal government shall be vested … in the office of the presidency.” Trump and Elon Musk defend the cuts on Fox News Trump and Elon will address the government shake-up in a pre-taped Fox News interview set to air in a few hours. The conversation, recorded Friday with host Sean Hannity, is their first joint sit-down since Trump returned to office last month. Fox released a preview of the interview, showing Elon discussing his political change from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. “I used to be adored by the left,” Elon said. “Less so these days because of my support for Trump.” Elon blamed what he called “Trump Derangement Syndrome,” adding, “You don’t realize how real this is until you can’t reason with people. It’s like they’ve become completely irrational.” Trump, speaking yesterday at a Florida news conference, teased the interview, telling reporters that he warned Elon Musk about potential conflicts of interest between his private companies and government projects. “I told Elon straight up: You can’t work on government projects that interfere with your companies,” Trump said, referencing Elon’s SpaceX, which contracts with NASA. Elon Musk shuts down agencies, expands control Elon has wasted no time dismantling federal agencies. Last week, he shut down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an agency created after the 2008 financial crash to protect consumers from bank fraud and fintech scams. Elon Musk announced the closure with a single post on X: “CFPB RIP” followed by a gravestone emoji. His decision effectively kills consumer financial protections, stripping oversight from the fintech industry just as Elon’s own X platform secures a top banking deal, something the Democrats were quick to point out. Days before shutting down the CFPB, Elon’s X signed a deal with Visa to launch X Money Account, part of his push to turn X into an “everything app.” The platform will now offer banking services, social media, AI support, and, as critics point out, a haven for extremist propaganda—all under one roof. Trump defended Elon’s unchecked power, saying the billionaire is policing his own conflicts. “Elon is doing a fantastic job,” Trump told reporters. “You can trust him.” A report from the Financial Times claims that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had expected a formal state meeting when he visited Washington last week, but instead, he found himself sitting across from three of Elon’s children and one of their mothers in what was supposed to be an official discussion on Tesla and SpaceX expansion in India.

The Bitcoin market, known for its wild swings, has been unusually calm lately. But is this tranquility the calm before the storm? For months, Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading within a surprisingly narrow band, leaving many wondering – what’s next? Let’s dive into the expert analysis that suggests we might be on the verge of a significant price movement . Why is Bitcoin’s Price Range So Tight? According to senior analyst James Van Straten from CoinDesk, Bitcoin has been confined to a tight BTC price range of $91,000 to $109,000 since late November. This period of stability is quite unusual for Bitcoin, which is typically known for its dramatic ups and downs. Think of it like a coiled spring – the longer it’s compressed, the more forcefully it’s likely to snap back. Van Straten points out a key market characteristic: volatility tends to mean-revert. In simpler terms, periods of low Bitcoin volatility are often followed by periods of high volatility, and vice versa. This natural ebb and flow is a fundamental aspect of market dynamics. Data Deep Dive: Signs of Impending Volatility Expansion To back up his analysis, Van Straten cites compelling data from Glassnode, a leading on-chain analytics firm. Let’s break down the key indicators signaling a potential volatility expansion : Two-Week Realized Volatility: This metric has plummeted to an annualized 32%, hitting multi-year lows. Realized volatility essentially measures the actual price fluctuations over a specific period. A low reading indicates a period of relative price stability. One-Month Implied Volatility: Similarly, implied volatility, which reflects market expectations of future price swings, has dipped below 50%. This is also at multi-year lows, suggesting that traders are not currently anticipating significant price fluctuations in the near term. Checkmate’s “Choppiness Index”: Analyst Checkmate’s proprietary index further reinforces the picture of suppressed volatility. On a weekly chart, the Choppiness Index indicates that Bitcoin’s trading range is at its narrowest since 2015. Imagine Bitcoin trading in a corridor so tight it’s like walking a tightrope! These indicators collectively paint a picture of a market holding its breath, with Bitcoin volatility suppressed to levels rarely seen in recent years. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? The million-dollar question, of course, is what happens next? Van Straten suggests that Bitcoin is poised to break out of this constricted range soon. However, the direction of this breakout remains uncertain. Will we see a surge upwards, or a sharp correction downwards? Here’s what to consider in this unpredictable crypto market analysis : Potential for a Significant Price Movement: The longer Bitcoin remains in this tight range, the greater the potential for a powerful breakout. Think of it like shaking a soda bottle – the pressure builds up, and when it finally opens, the release can be explosive. Uncertainty in Direction: While volatility is expected to increase, the direction of the price movement is not guaranteed. It could be upwards, driven by renewed bullish sentiment, or downwards, potentially triggered by negative news or profit-taking. Importance of Risk Management: In times of anticipated volatility, risk management becomes paramount. Traders and investors should be prepared for potentially rapid and significant price swings. Strategies like stop-loss orders and portfolio diversification can be crucial. To visualize the situation, consider the table below summarizing the key volatility indicators: Volatility Indicator Current Level Significance Two-Week Realized Volatility Annualized 32% Multi-year Low One-Month Implied Volatility Below 50% Multi-year Low Checkmate’s Choppiness Index Tightest Range Since 2015 Actionable Insights: Preparing for Bitcoin’s Next Move So, what should you do amidst this anticipation of increased Bitcoin volatility ? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on market news and analysis. Developments in regulation, institutional adoption, and macroeconomic factors can all influence Bitcoin’s price. Review Your Risk Tolerance: Assess your comfort level with potential price swings. Volatility can present opportunities, but also carries risks. Adjust your portfolio and trading strategies accordingly. Consider Trading Strategies: For active traders, volatility breakouts can offer trading opportunities. Strategies like breakout trading or volatility-based options strategies might become relevant. However, these require careful execution and risk management. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term investors, short-term volatility might be less concerning. Focus on the long-term fundamentals of Bitcoin and its potential in the evolving digital asset landscape. Conclusion: Brace Yourselves for Potential Bitcoin Volatility The current lull in Bitcoin volatility appears to be a temporary state. Expert analysis and data indicators suggest that we are nearing a point where Bitcoin is likely to break free from its current BTC price range . Whether this breakout will be upwards or downwards remains to be seen. However, one thing is clear: the crypto market is about to get interesting again. Prepare for potential price swings and ensure your risk management strategies are in place. The coiled spring is about to release!

40524142,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=130349,1739934556,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent SEC Shift? Ripple Appeal Pause Predicted in Dramatic Crypto Regulation Twist!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-ripple-appeal-pause/,"In a potentially seismic shift for the cryptocurrency landscape, John Reed Stark, a former high-ranking official at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has dropped a bombshell prediction. Stark, who once headed the SEC’s Office of Internet Enforcement, took to X (formerly Twitter) to suggest that the SEC might be on the verge of pausing or even withdrawing all pending crypto-related appeals, most notably the high-profile case against Ripple. This bold forecast has sent ripples (pun intended!) through the crypto community, sparking intense debate and speculation about the future of crypto regulation in the United States. Is this the dawn of a new era for digital assets, or just a temporary lull in the regulatory storm? Why a Pause on Crypto Appeals? Understanding the SEC’s Potential Strategy Shift Stark’s prediction hinges on the recent formation of a dedicated crypto task force within the SEC. He posits that this task force is not just another bureaucratic layer, but a strategic move to fundamentally reassess and potentially streamline the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation . Instead of continuing costly and potentially protracted legal battles, Stark suggests the SEC might be opting for a more unified and decisive strategy. But what could be driving this apparent change of heart? Resource Reallocation: Legal appeals are resource-intensive, demanding significant time, personnel, and financial capital. Pausing appeals could free up these resources, allowing the SEC to focus on other critical areas, perhaps including the development of clearer regulatory frameworks. Strategic Reassessment: The crypto landscape is rapidly evolving. A pause could provide the SEC with valuable time to reassess its regulatory strategies, ensuring they are effective and adaptable to the dynamic nature of digital assets. Task Force Influence: The newly formed crypto task force likely brings fresh perspectives and expertise. Their recommendations might be pushing for a more pragmatic and less litigious approach to crypto regulation . Public and Industry Pressure: The SEC has faced increasing pressure from the crypto industry and even some lawmakers to provide clearer guidance and avoid stifling innovation through enforcement actions. A pause could be seen as a response to this pressure. However, it’s crucial to remember that this is a prediction, albeit from a well-informed source. The SEC has not officially announced any such plans. The crypto world is now holding its breath, waiting to see if Stark’s forecast will materialize. Ripple Case in the Spotlight: What Does a Pause Mean for XRP? The mention of Ripple in Stark’s prediction is particularly noteworthy. The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs, alleging that XRP is an unregistered security, has been one of the most closely watched legal battles in the crypto space. A pause in the appeal process would have significant implications for Ripple and the XRP token. Potential Ripple Case Scenarios if SEC Pauses Appeals: Scenario Potential Impact on Ripple & XRP Temporary Pause: SEC halts appeal to reassess strategy. Uncertainty remains, but short-term positive sentiment for XRP as immediate legal pressure eases. Withdrawal of Appeal: SEC drops the appeal entirely. Major victory for Ripple. XRP price could see a significant surge. Increased clarity and potential for wider adoption of XRP. Negotiated Settlement: SEC and Ripple reach a settlement outside of court. Positive outcome for Ripple, potentially involving some concessions but avoiding prolonged legal battles. XRP likely to react positively. For XRP holders and the broader Ripple community, the prospect of a pause or withdrawal of the appeal is undoubtedly exciting. It could signal a turning point in the long-standing legal saga and potentially pave the way for a more constructive relationship between Ripple and regulators. Crypto Appeals Across the Board: A Wider Regulatory Shift? Stark’s prediction extends beyond just the Ripple case, suggesting a potential pause or withdrawal of all crypto appeals . This broader implication is even more significant, hinting at a possible paradigm shift in how the SEC approaches crypto enforcement. If the SEC is indeed reconsidering its aggressive litigation strategy, what could be the underlying reasons? Factors Potentially Influencing SEC’s Approach to Crypto Appeals: Legislative Pressure: Growing calls for clearer crypto legislation from Congress might be prompting the SEC to re-evaluate its enforcement-centric approach in favor of more collaborative regulatory frameworks. Court Rulings: Recent court decisions in crypto-related cases might have given the SEC pause, suggesting that their legal arguments are not always guaranteed to prevail. Industry Engagement: A pause could be a strategic move to foster more dialogue and collaboration with the crypto industry, aiming for more practical and industry-informed regulations. Global Regulatory Landscape: The SEC might be observing how other jurisdictions are regulating crypto and considering adopting best practices or harmonizing regulations internationally. A widespread pause on crypto appeals would signal a significant change in the regulatory climate. It could foster a more innovation-friendly environment, potentially attracting more investment and development in the crypto space within the U.S. John Reed Stark’s Insight: A Credible Voice in Crypto Regulation? John Reed Stark’s prediction carries weight due to his extensive experience within the SEC. Having served as chief of the Office of Internet Enforcement, he possesses an insider’s perspective on the agency’s operations and regulatory thinking. His insights are often closely followed by the crypto community, and his pronouncements can influence market sentiment. While his predictions are not infallible, they offer valuable context and potential foreshadowing of future regulatory actions. However, it’s essential to approach any prediction with a degree of caution. Regulatory bodies like the SEC are complex organizations with multiple stakeholders and evolving priorities. Stark’s view, while informed, represents one perspective. The actual direction of SEC policy will depend on a multitude of factors and internal decision-making processes. What’s Next for Crypto Regulation? Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community Whether or not Stark’s prediction comes to fruition, the situation highlights the ongoing uncertainty and evolution of crypto regulation . For individuals and businesses operating in the crypto space, what are the key takeaways and actionable insights? Actionable Insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments, not just in the U.S. but globally. Follow credible news sources, legal experts, and industry analysts. Engage in Dialogue: Participate in industry discussions and advocate for sensible and innovation-friendly regulations. Engage with policymakers and regulators when opportunities arise. Compliance Focus: Prioritize compliance with existing regulations and prepare for potential future regulatory changes. Robust compliance frameworks are crucial for long-term sustainability in the crypto space. Diversification: In the face of regulatory uncertainty, diversification remains a prudent strategy. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, whether it’s specific cryptocurrencies or regulatory jurisdictions. Prepare for Volatility: Regulatory news can significantly impact crypto markets. Be prepared for potential price volatility and manage risk accordingly. A Turning Point or a Temporary Reprieve? The Future of Crypto Regulation Hangs in the Balance John Reed Stark’s prediction of a potential SEC pause on crypto appeals has injected a dose of cautious optimism into the crypto market. Whether this signifies a genuine shift in the SEC’s regulatory approach or merely a tactical pause remains to be seen. However, it undeniably underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of crypto regulation . The coming weeks and months will be crucial in determining the SEC’s next moves and the long-term trajectory of crypto oversight in the United States. For now, the crypto world watches, waits, and speculates on whether this prediction will usher in a more constructive era of crypto regulation , or if it’s simply a momentary calm before the next regulatory wave.

Many are asking this question as we navigate the ever-exciting, often volatile world of cryptocurrency. But hold on to your hats, crypto enthusiasts! According to on-chain analyst oinonen_t, the current Bitcoin cycle still has significant upward potential, even after the recent halving event. Let’s dive into why this analyst believes the Bitcoin story is far from over and what factors could fuel the next leg up in the crypto market growth . Bitcoin Halving Cycle: Are We Still Early? For those new to the crypto space, a Bitcoin halving is a pre-programmed event that occurs roughly every four years, reducing the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks by half. Historically, these halvings have been followed by significant price increases. Oinonen_t’s analysis, shared on CryptoQuant, suggests we might be in a similar, yet still early, phase of the post-halving cycle. Let’s break down the numbers: 2020 Halving: Following the 2020 halving, Bitcoin experienced a staggering 686% surge. 2024 Halving (to date): Since the April 2024 halving, Bitcoin’s increase has been a more modest 63%. This data points to a considerable difference in percentage gains, suggesting that if historical patterns repeat, there could be substantial room for further BTC price prediction increases in this cycle. While past performance isn’t a guarantee of future results, these historical trends are definitely something to consider. Could we see a similar explosive growth trajectory as seen in previous cycles? Time will tell, but the analyst’s perspective certainly offers a hopeful outlook. Institutional Demand for Bitcoin: The MicroStrategy Effect Beyond historical cycles, another key indicator highlighted in the analysis is the continued strong institutional demand for Bitcoin . Leading the charge in this space is business intelligence firm Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). Their relentless accumulation of Bitcoin speaks volumes about the confidence institutional players have in the long-term value proposition of BTC. Why is this significant? Market Validation: Large institutions investing in Bitcoin lends credibility and legitimacy to the asset class. Reduced Supply: As institutions buy and hold Bitcoin, it reduces the available supply on exchanges, potentially driving up prices. Leading Indicator: Institutional investment is often seen as a leading indicator, suggesting that smart money anticipates future price appreciation. Strategy’s ongoing Bitcoin buying spree isn’t just a headline; it’s a tangible demonstration of strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future. This institutional demand for Bitcoin acts as a powerful tailwind, potentially pushing prices higher as more institutions enter or expand their crypto holdings. Macroeconomic Impact on Crypto: The Ukraine Factor The analysis also touches upon the broader macroeconomic impact on crypto , particularly mentioning the potential for a resolution in the Ukraine conflict. While seemingly unrelated at first glance, geopolitical events can have significant ripple effects across global markets, including the cryptocurrency market. How could an armistice in Ukraine boost risk assets like Bitcoin? Reduced Uncertainty: Geopolitical tensions often create uncertainty in markets. A move towards peace could reduce this uncertainty, encouraging investors to take on more risk. Improved Global Sentiment: Positive global events tend to improve overall market sentiment, benefiting risk assets like Bitcoin. Capital Flow Shift: A more stable geopolitical landscape could lead to a shift in capital flows, potentially directing more investment towards growth-oriented assets like cryptocurrencies. While predicting geopolitical events is notoriously difficult, the analysis rightly points out that positive developments on the macroeconomic front could act as a significant catalyst for the crypto market growth and specifically for Bitcoin. It’s a reminder that the crypto market doesn’t operate in isolation and is influenced by broader global events. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what are the key takeaways from this analysis, and what actionable insights can you glean? Long-Term Perspective: The analysis reinforces the idea that Bitcoin investing is often a long-term game. Post-halving cycles historically play out over a period of time. Monitor Institutional Activity: Keep an eye on institutional investment trends, particularly companies like Strategy. Their actions can provide valuable signals. Stay Informed on Macro Events: Be aware of how macroeconomic and geopolitical events could impact the crypto market. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Given the potential for future growth but also market volatility, DCA can be a prudent strategy for accumulating Bitcoin over time. It’s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile and unpredictable. This analysis offers a perspective based on historical data and current market dynamics, but it’s not financial advice. Always conduct your own thorough research and consider your risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. Conclusion: The Bitcoin Journey Continues In conclusion, the analysis from oinonen_t paints a picture of continued potential for Bitcoin’s post-halving cycle. Fueled by historical patterns, strong institutional demand for Bitcoin , and potential macroeconomic tailwinds, the narrative suggests that the Bitcoin story is far from over. While technical corrections are always possible in the volatile crypto market, the underlying factors point towards further crypto market growth and potential upside for BTC price prediction .

Leading crypto analyst Ali Martinez has issued a stark warning, suggesting the highly anticipated altseason could vanish if Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, breaches a critical price level. This news has sent ripples through the crypto community, leaving investors wondering what’s next for their altcoin portfolios. Let’s dive into Martinez’s analysis and explore what this crucial $2,600 ETH price point means for the future of altcoins. Why is the $2.6K Ethereum Price Level a Make-or-Break Point for Altseason? Martinez’s analysis, shared on X, hinges on the pivotal role Ethereum plays in the broader altcoin market. Ethereum’s network is the backbone for a vast majority of altcoins, serving as their primary platform for development, trading, and functionality. Historically, a strong Ethereum performance has often paved the way for a thriving altseason, where alternative cryptocurrencies experience significant price surges and increased investor interest. Conversely, Ethereum’s weakness can cast a shadow over the entire altcoin landscape. Here’s why the $2,600 level is so critical according to market analysis: Psychological Support: The $2,600 mark represents a significant psychological support level for Ethereum. Breaching this level could trigger fear and uncertainty among investors, leading to further sell-offs. Technical Indicator: From a technical analysis perspective, a sustained break below $2,600 could signal a shift in market sentiment from bullish to bearish for Ethereum. This could be interpreted as a broader market correction signal. Altcoin Dependency: Altcoins are often more volatile and dependent on Ethereum’s strength. If ETH weakens, investors may become risk-averse and pull capital out of altcoins, exacerbating a potential downturn. Historical Precedent: Past market cycles have shown a correlation between Ethereum’s price movements and altcoin season. Ethereum leading the charge upwards has often been a precursor to altseason rallies. In essence, Martinez is suggesting that $2,600 isn’t just another price point for Ethereum; it’s a crucial line in the sand that could determine the fate of the anticipated altseason. A break below this level could indicate a deeper correction for ETH and, consequently, a delay or even cancellation of the altseason. Decoding the Analyst’s Warning: What Does This Mean for Your Altcoin Portfolio? So, what actionable insights can we glean from this crypto analyst’s warning? For altcoin investors, this news serves as a critical alert to closely monitor Ethereum’s price action. Here’s a breakdown of potential scenarios and recommended actions: Scenario Potential Impact on Altcoins Actionable Insights for Investors ETH Holds Above $2.6K Altseason potential remains alive. Continued ETH strength could fuel altcoin rallies. Maintain current altcoin positions, consider strategic accumulation if market conditions are favorable. ETH Breaks Below $2.6K (Briefly) Potential short-term altcoin dip. Market volatility likely to increase. Exercise caution, consider setting stop-loss orders to protect against further downside. Monitor market sentiment closely. ETH Breaks Below $2.6K (Sustained) Altseason highly unlikely. Deeper correction in altcoin values possible. Reduce altcoin exposure, consider hedging strategies, prepare for potential market downturn. Re-evaluate risk tolerance. It’s important to remember that market analysis, even from seasoned crypto analysts, is not foolproof. However, Martinez’s projection highlights a significant risk factor that altcoin investors should be aware of. Staying informed and adaptable is key in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Understanding Altseason: What Exactly is it and Why is Ethereum So Crucial? For those new to the crypto space, let’s quickly define “altseason.” Altseason, short for “alternative cryptocurrency season,” refers to a period in the cryptocurrency market when altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) experience significant price appreciation, often outperforming Bitcoin. This phenomenon is typically driven by a combination of factors, including: Bitcoin’s Dominance Cycle: After Bitcoin experiences a significant bull run, profits often rotate into altcoins as investors seek higher percentage gains in smaller-cap cryptocurrencies. Increased Risk Appetite: During bullish market phases, investors tend to have a higher risk appetite and are more willing to invest in altcoins, which are generally considered riskier than Bitcoin. Technological Advancements & Narratives: New technological developments, exciting project launches, and compelling narratives around specific altcoins can also fuel altseason rallies. Ethereum’s Ecosystem: As mentioned earlier, Ethereum’s robust ecosystem is a major driver of altcoin activity. Many promising altcoins are built on the Ethereum blockchain, and its overall health significantly impacts the altcoin market. Ethereum’s centrality to altseason stems from its role as the leading smart contract platform and the foundation for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). A healthy and vibrant Ethereum ecosystem is crucial for the growth and prosperity of the vast majority of altcoins. Therefore, any signs of weakness in Ethereum, such as a break below a critical price level like $2.6K, can have a cascading effect on the entire altcoin market. Navigating the Market Uncertainty: Beyond the $2.6K Ethereum Price Point While the $2.6K Ethereum price level is undoubtedly a critical threshold, it’s crucial to consider a broader market analysis to make informed investment decisions. Relying solely on one analyst’s prediction or a single price point can be limiting. Here are some additional factors to keep in mind: Overall Market Sentiment: Monitor broader market sentiment indicators, such as the Fear & Greed Index, Bitcoin’s price action, and macroeconomic factors. Ethereum Network Fundamentals: Assess Ethereum’s network activity, including transaction volume, gas fees, and developer activity. A strong and active network suggests underlying health. Altcoin Specific Catalysts: Research individual altcoins and identify potential catalysts that could drive their price, regardless of Ethereum’s short-term price movements. Risk Management Strategies: Implement robust risk management strategies, including diversification, position sizing, and stop-loss orders, to protect your portfolio in volatile market conditions. The cryptocurrency market is inherently dynamic and unpredictable. While analyst predictions like Martinez’s offer valuable insights, they should be used as one piece of the puzzle in your overall investment strategy. Staying informed, diversifying your research, and practicing sound risk management are essential for navigating the crypto landscape, regardless of whether altseason arrives or is temporarily delayed. Conclusion: Stay Vigilant and Prepared in the Face of Potential Market Shifts Ali Martinez’s warning about the $2.6K Ethereum price level and its implications for altseason serves as a crucial reminder of the interconnectedness and volatility of the cryptocurrency market. While the future remains uncertain, this analysis underscores the importance of vigilance and preparedness.

The Libra token got a huge burst of publicity when Argentina’s President Javier Milei posted on X.com about the project and then deleted his post. In the hours in between, LIBRA shot to a market cap of $4.4 billion and then collapsed after developers dumped their coins, extracting $107 million in liquidity while wiping out $4 billion in value and leaving investors with huge losses. Milei has been accused of fraud by lawyers, is facing a probe by an Argentine federal judge, and has been threatened with impeachment.

Coinbase, a major U.S.-based crypto exchange, has introduced new offerings for institutions in the jurisdiction. The exchange announced it had introduced CFTC-regulated futures for Solana (SOL) and Hedera (HBAR), citing the increasing demand for futures among U.S. investors. Coinbase exchange unveils CFTC-regulated Hedera and Solana futures through Coinbase Derivatives Coinbase Derivatives, LLC now offers CFTC-regulated futures for $SOL and $HBAR –bringing more institutional-grade crypto products to the U.S. futures market. pic.twitter.com/rLJz1bQGRA — Coinbase Institutional 🛡️ (@CoinbaseInsto) February 18, 2025 Coinbase Exchange announced that it will offer the new futures products through its Coinbase Derivatives, LLC (CDE), a U.S. CFTC-registered Designated Contract Market (DCM). According to the announcement, the exchange self-certified with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to list the futures contracts for Hedera (HBAR) and Solana (SOL). The exchange explained that the launch marked a new milestone representing the evolution of crypto derivatives’ regulations in the U.S. Coinbase highlighted that the new additions bring the total CDE futures contracts to 19 including the listings of Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, Stellar, and Gold. In mid-July last year, Coinbase Derivatives launched margined futures contracts for Avalanche (AVAX), Chainlink (LINK), Polkadot (DOT), Stellar (XLM), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Coinbase Derivatives said the contracts will give market participants a chance to manage risk, speculate on price movements, and invest with lower upfront capital requirements. The announcement detailed that the futures contracts are designed to have specific specifications inclined towards favoring market participants. These specifications include, 5 SOL per contract for Nano Solana Futures (SOL), 100 SOL per contract for Solana Futures (SLC), and 5000 HBAR per contract for Hedera Futures (HED). In August 2023, Coinbase Financial Markets, Inc. (CFM), a wholly owned Coinbase Global, Inc. subsidiary, received regulatory approval from the National Futures Association (NFA) to function as a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM). Since then, the exchange has extended its offerings to include crypto and traditional commodities contracts. The exchange also announced that its offerings will serve institutional investors by giving them access to regulated futures, including crypto and traditional commodities contracts. Coinbase’s announcement detailed that eligible institutions will now have access to futures trading through Coinbase Financial Markets, Inc. Coinbase argued that the platform will effectively bridge traditional finance and crypto, giving the market participants the necessary tools for effectively managing crypto risk and exposure through advanced trading strategies. Coinbase exchange unveils EURC-USDC perpetual futures for crypto traders In the same announcement, Coinbase exchange unveiled EURC-USDC perpetual futures to give traders seamless 24/7 access to Euro price exposure. The traditional foreign exchange (FX) market is among the largest and most liquid financial markets worldwide. The financial market boasts over $7.5 trillion in daily trading volume, and Coinbase seeks to be part of it. According to Coinbase exchange, EURC perpetual futures will offer an alternative to Foreign Exchange trading. The exchange announced that the offerings dictate a major milestone toward enabling traders to unlock value on crypto rails and decentralizing global finance. EURC-PERP will offer a leverage of up to 20x to increase capital efficiency for traders while simultaneously providing instant settlement. Coinbase exchange explained in a blog that EURC perpetual futures will not expire, thus allowing for continuous Euro price exposure without the need to roll contracts. The exchange’s blog also explained that Eligible non-U.S. institutions can trade EURC-PERP on Coinbase International Exchange while eligible non-U.S. retail investors can trade on Coinbase Advanced. Coinbase announced that it will continue to improve its derivatives offering with new contract listings, enhanced trading tools, and risk management features designed to meet the changing investor needs.

FloppyPepe (FPPE) , an AI token with cutting-edge AI technology and the viral appeal of meme culture is capturing attention with a potential return on investment that could surpass even the most successful meme coins of the past. Pepe (PEPE): Top Position Is Under Threat Pepe (PEPE) has long been a staple in the meme coin market, but it lacks the technological advancements for growth. While Pepe (PEPE) was a cultural phenomenon, the AI token narrative is gaining strength, and FloppyPepe (FPPE) is positioned to capitalize on this trend far better than Pepe (PEPE) ever could. Pepe (PEPE) is just riding on nostalgia, which means the potential for Pepe (PEPE) to grow is more dependent on consistent community-backed hype rather than technological advancement. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Future Of Meme Coins And AI Tokens FloppyPepe (FPPE) is taking the meme coin market by storm, building on the inspired legacy of Matt Furie, the creator of PEPE. This AI token doesn’t just embrace meme culture; it redefines it. By blending Furie’s artistic influence with advanced AI capabilities, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is set to outshine other tokens in the meme coin market in terms of utility and profitability. Unlike ordinary meme coins, FloppyPepe (FPPE) has introduced a unique AI ecosystem that includes FloppyX , a cutting-edge AI video agent that enables users to produce interactive video content using a sophisticated AI bot framework. This utility guarantees FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out in the AI token space. In addition, the project features Meme-o-Matic, a meme-generation AI tool that allows users to create viral content. Users can submit text prompts, video clips, and images, allowing the AI to generate viral memes in seconds, making it effortless for anyone to generate high-quality, engaging content. The buzz surrounding FloppyPepe (FPPE) is undeniable. In just 24 hours, the private round sold out at a staggering $907,200, proving that investors recognize its massive potential. The public presale is an opportunity to get in early at an astonishingly low price of $0.0000002 before the AI token skyrockets by an estimated 7,500%. This expected surge could see a $1,000 investment grow into $75,000, while a $5,000 investment could turn into $375,000 when FloppyPepe (FPPE) surges in 2025’s bullish meme coin market. For a meme coin to thrive, investors need a guarantee against rug pulls, and no better guarantee of security beats FloppyPepe’s (FPPE), multi-signature wallets , and bug bounty programs in the meme coin market. Furthermore, the project boasts a SolidProof- audited smart contract, so investors can rest assured that their funds are safe. Moreover, FloppyPepe (FPPE) employs a token burn mechanism , which mandates that 1% of the total supply is constantly removed to increase prices. The AI token sector is ascending; as CoinMarketCap’s AI tokens index shows, AI-powered cryptocurrencies are rapidly gaining traction. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is at the forefront of this movement, offering AI utilities that go beyond what any meme coin has done before. The AI ecosystem doesn’t stop there. In just two weeks, FloppyPepe (FPPE) will launch its text-to-image AI agent via its Telegram community, allowing early adopters to maximize its powerful technology before the masses catch on. This rapid development shows why this AI token is necessary in any crypto portfolio. Conclusion: Early Move To FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is Ideal The FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale is the opportunity of a lifetime. With the token currently priced at just $0.0000002 , early investors have the chance to secure massive gains before the price jumps by 7,500%. As the AI token sector explodes and the meme coin market continues its meteoric rise, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is positioned as the top project to watch. With its groundbreaking AI agents, strong security features, and community-driven approach, it’s only a matter of time before this AI token becomes the dominant force in the crypto space. Don’t wait until it’s too late. The greater PEPE is here, and it’s smarter and more profitable.

Analysts Weigh In,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/is-ethereum-quietly-building-momentum-for-a-rally-analysts-weigh-in/,"Ethereum’s recent price performance indicates a departure from the negative trends that are seen in the broader cryptocurrency market. While assets such as Bitcoin have faced downward pressure, Ethereum managed a slight positive move yesterday, pushing its market value back above $2,700. Amid this price move, questions have been raised about whether the asset might be quietly building momentum for a sudden rally. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms A Bullish Pattern – Expert Reveals Short-Term Price Target Quiet Moves Behind The Scenes Santiment, a well-regarded market intelligence platform has recently highlighted this price performance from ETH on X, noting that Ethereum has outpaced many altcoins at the start of the week. This performance as reported by Santiment may be attributed to the ongoing trend of ETH moving from exchanges into cold wallets at an accelerating rate. In fact, only 6.38% of the available supply remains on exchanges, the lowest figure since Ethereum’s inception, according to Santiment. Santiment also revealed that renewed interest from the ETH community appears to be another factor behind this momentum. 📈 Ethereum has shown mild signs of a rebound, currently back up to a market value of $2,745 and outpacing most altcoins to start the week.

Santiment’s analysis points to these movements as early indicators that Ethereum may be positioned for more sustained growth in the coming months. A Potential Upside for Ethereum and Altcoins Looking ahead, various market analysts have shared optimistic outlooks for Ethereum’s performance. Javon Marks, for example, sees ETH emerging from a lengthy consolidation phase. Related Reading: Altseason At Risk? Expert Believes Ethereum Must Hold $2,600 To Sustain Momentum According to Marks, the asset could potentially recover over 72% from its current levels, returning to its all-time high zones. Such a move might also spark significant bullish momentum for other altcoins, further enhancing Ethereum’s role as an altcoin market leader. Coming out of what may have only been a massive bottoming/consolidation, $ETH could be setting up here for an over +72.1% surge in a recovery back to its ATH areas!

However, the industry as a whole needs to more to become bullet proof, said TradFi experts at the ""Views From Wall Street to Crypto"" event held at Consensus Hong Kong on Wednesday. ""You have traditional players who have come into the space now, especially for us, most of our trading happens of exchange settlement, where you actually keep your assets on custodians while you are able to trade on exchanges,"" Gautam Sharma, CEO and CIO of Brevan Howard said. ""So the technology has come far ahead in terms of the last 18 months since then, [but] there's more work to do."" Sharma stressed the need for 24/7 risk management, including market, counterparty, and credit risks. Counterparty risk refers to the possibility of one party involved in a transaction failing to meet its obligation, resulting in a loss to the other party. This type of risk is higher in crypto than in traditional finance, given the absence of intermediaries such as banks or clearing houses that ensure trust and settlements, and it is a cause of concern for both directional and non-directional arbitration players. ""When we do arbitrage, the counterparty risk is the most important one,"" Fabio Frontini, founder of Abraxas Capital Management, said, adding that credit risk is also very important. Frontini stressed the importance of simulating stress testing scenarios, referring to the perpetual futures market where users can lose the margin when stopped out on a trade, which is not the case in traditional markets. ""It [stress testing] can be very rewarding, when done properly,"" Frontini added. Mike Kuehnel, CEO of the market-making firm Flow Traders, highlighted the need to make innovation transparent to win over investor confidence and ensure ""availability of data and moving liquidity without fragmentation around it."" ""Getting the best price and giving you the possibility to transact whenever you want to is a key ingredient,"" Kuehnel added. Liquidity, or the ability of the market to absorb large orders at stable prices, emerged as a significant concern following the collapse of FTX and its sister concern, Alameda.

His posts mention a “Trump effect” that appears to be guiding Ripple’s increased focus on the U.S. market, potentially driving up XRP’s value. This has generated excitement among market participants, especially in the XRP community. The article, titled “Ripple’s Garlinghouse Touts ‘Trump Effect’ Amid Bump in U.S. Deals,” discusses how Ripple, the company behind the cryptocurrency XRP, has seen a boost in its business opportunities in the U.S. since the 2024 election. It also includes insights from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who talks about the impact of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s actions on Ripple and how the “Trump bull market” is real. Many in the crypto community were quick to react to Trump’s post, especially given Ripple’s significant presence in the U.S. market. According to Garlinghouse, Ripple has signed more U.S. deals in the last few months of 2024 than during the previous half-year period, marking a shift toward more business growth stateside. This surge in U.S.-based operations was also highlighted by the fact that 75% of Ripple’s open roles are now U.S.-based, a stark contrast to the past few years, when most hiring was outside of the country. Link: https://t.co/PQLbHladMl — Good Morning Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) February 19, 2025 Ripple has had strong connections with Trump’s team, having donated to the Fair Shape PAC during the election, and Ripple executives have even met with Trump in the past. While it remains unclear exactly how much influence Trump has had on Ripple’s operations, the article shared by Trump could signal growing support for Ripple as the company continues to thrive in the U.S. market.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|XRP|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-19 03:51:48

Exploring Its Smart Contracts, Chargeback Defense, & $1.4M Presale",https://thecoinrise.com/is-web3bay-the-solution-to-e-commerce-fraud-exploring-its-smart-contracts-chargeback-defense-1-4m-presale/,"The digital shopping era has revolutionized global commerce, enabling consumers to buy products globally with unprecedented ease. Yet, this convenience has also introduced significant vulnerabilities. Online platforms are increasingly plagued by fraud, including deceptive listings, chargeback deceptions, and falsified reviews, eroding trust and causing financial detriment to both purchasers and vendors. A 2024 Juniper Research study forecasts that online payment fraud will inflict business losses exceeding $48 billion by 2025. Predominantly troubling is chargeback fraud, where customers falsely dispute receiving products to secure refunds. Concurrently, manipulated reviews sway consumer choices, blurring the lines between genuine merchants and fraudsters. While behemoths like Amazon and eBay have implemented certain checks, their centralized control exhibits intrinsic flaws. Blockchain technology offers a promising resolution, with Web3Bay at the vanguard of this innovative shift. How Web3Bay’s Smart Contracts Thwart Fraud Web3Bay harnesses the power of blockchain-based smart contracts to foster a trustless, transparent, and secure trading environment. These contracts automate and enforce agreements between parties, guaranteeing that transactions, from payment to delivery, are executed equitably and securely. Key Elements of Web3Bay’s Anti-Fraud Mechanism: Smart Contract Escrow: Funds are secured within a smart contract and released only after the buyer verifies receipt. In disputes, a neutral adjudication process assesses transaction data before releasing payments. Decentralized Identity Verification: Employing blockchain-based KYC protocols, Web3Bay authenticates seller identities, mitigating fraudulent profiles and counterfeit listings. Immutable Review System: Web3Bay records all user feedback on the blockchain, ensuring reviews are tamper-proof and transparent, thus fostering a more honest marketplace. Chargeback Protection: Leveraging blockchain payments, traditional chargebacks become infeasible. After a smart contract validates a transaction, the payment record becomes unalterable, nullifying illegitimate refund claims. These innovations directly tackle prevalent e-commerce challenges, bolstering confidence in transaction authenticity for both buyers and sellers. Web3Bay Presale & Market Forecast Web3Bay’s ongoing presale has captivated substantial investor interest, mirroring strong belief in its business model. By February 18, 2025, it has amassed over $1.4 million in Stage 5 of its presale, distributing over 350 million 3BAY tokens. Each presale stage has seen a 15% price increment, with an anticipated market entry price of $0.1959. Decentralized commerce, already a burgeoning $13 billion industry, continues to grow as consumers demand more secure and transparent dealings. Although competitors like OpenBazaar and Origin Protocol have explored similar avenues, they have faced hurdles in user adoption and liquidity. Web3Bay sets itself apart by fostering real-world merchant integration and emphasizing security with automated smart contracts. Moreover, the 3BAY token provides diverse functionalities, including governance, staking rewards, and marketplace incentives, attracting crypto investors seeking viable asset applications. Summing Up! With a presale that has exceeded expectations and increasing blockchain integration in e-commerce, Web3Bay is poised to redefine online retail security. By addressing fraud with smart contracts and indelible reviews, it offers a dependable alternative to traditional platforms. As it progresses towards a full launch, the platform’s scalability and merchant onboarding capabilities will be critical to its sustained success in redefining the decentralized market landscape.

The price is now trading below $2.650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.620 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

Among these emerging projects, some stand out for their unique offerings and massive potential. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), for instance, has been creating a stir with its growing presale excitement, while Zignaly and Chainlink have been evolving with innovative solutions. Arctic Pablo Coin is drawing attention with its community-driven approach and unique tokenomics, making it a standout among meme coins. Meanwhile, Zignaly continues to lead in decentralized trading with automated trading bots, while Chainlink remains a key player in blockchain infrastructure, providing secure and reliable oracles. If you’re on the hunt for popular crypto to buy, Arctic Pablo Coin is certainly a name to remember. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Zignaly, and Chainlink. Arctic Pablo Coin: Presale Explodes with Unmatched Excitement Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) has quickly positioned itself as one of the most exciting meme coins to emerge in the market. What makes this project so appealing is its engaging community and massive presale potential. The meme coin presale is currently progressing through several phases, and with each stage, the price per token increases significantly. Arctic Pablo Coin is currently in the Blizzard Bay phase (the 11th stage), where the price is set at just $0.000063. As a result, early investors have already seen an impressive ROI of 12,618.77% from Blizzard Bay to the projected listing price of $0.008. Maximize Your Returns: Earn 66% APY with Arctic Pablo Coin’s Staking During Presale Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) offers an exciting opportunity for investors with an impressive 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) during its presale phase. This feature allows early adopters to stake their tokens and earn substantial rewards as the project progresses. Staking with APC is an easy way for investors to not only secure their position in the presale but also take advantage of the growth potential of the coin. With the presale gaining momentum, the added benefit of staking provides an incentive for long-term commitment to the project. As the Arctic Pablo Coin presale continues to generate buzz, staking becomes a smart strategy to maximize returns. Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the popular crypto to buy right now, and the 66% APY offers a solid incentive for both short-term and long-term holders. Zignaly: Empowering Crypto Traders with Revolutionary Tools Zignaly is another project that has been gaining attention due to its unique approach to cryptocurrency trading. The current price of ZIGChain is $0.10 per token (ZIG/USD), with a market capitalization of approximately $150 million. Unlike typical meme coins, Zignaly focuses on providing advanced trading tools for users, which gives investors a competitive edge in the market. The platform offers copy trading, which allows users to copy the strategies of expert traders, and signal services that guide crypto traders to make smarter decisions. What sets Zignaly apart is its focus on making professional-grade tools accessible to everyone, from beginners to experienced traders. By partnering with well-known crypto influencers and market experts, Zignaly is quickly gaining a strong reputation in the crypto space. Investors can take advantage of Zignaly’s trading tools while also leveraging its native token as part of its reward system, making it an appealing investment for both traders and holders alike. The market for crypto trading platforms is growing rapidly, and with Zignaly’s innovative features, it has the potential to carve out a niche for itself. While not as explosive as Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale excitement, Zignaly’s steady growth and focus on providing value to users make it a solid investment for the long term. Chainlink: A Trusted Oracle Solution for DeFi and Smart Contracts Chainlink is a well-established name in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), offering a critical solution to smart contracts with its Oracle network. Oracles are essential for bringing real-world data to the blockchain, and Chainlink has solidified itself as one of the leading providers of this service. Chainlink is currently priced at $18.78.By connecting smart contracts with external data, Chainlink helps power a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols. Chainlink’s native token, LINK, is widely used within the DeFi ecosystem, and its real-world utility is one of the key factors behind its success. The project has formed partnerships with major players in the crypto industry, further validating its position as a leading oracle solution. As the demand for DeFi and smart contracts continues to grow, Chainlink is well-positioned to capture a larger share of the market. While Chainlink is a more established project compared to Arctic Pablo Coin and Zignaly, its ongoing development and strong partnerships make it an exciting asset in the crypto space. Investors who are looking for a more stable investment with established market potential may find Chainlink to be a worthwhile addition to their portfolios. Conclusion: Arctic Pablo Coin Shines Brightest Among Three When looking at the three projects— Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Zignaly, and Chainlink—each has its appeal, but it’s clear that Arctic Pablo Coin stands out with its massive presale potential and community-driven initiatives. While Zignaly offers unique tools for traders and Chainlink continues to strengthen its position in the DeFi space, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale excitement and rapid growth make it an incredible opportunity for investors looking to make substantial gains. If you’re searching for a popular crypto to buy, Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the best choices right now, with 1000X potential and a growing community. Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the popular crypto to buy today due to its rapidly increasing value and innovative community features. Don’t miss out on the chance to invest early before the price increases further. With each passing phase, the ROI potential grows, so now is the time to secure your share of Arctic Pablo Coin before it becomes the next big hit in the crypto world.

The regulatory agency has recently requested delays in both cases, signaling a shift in its crypto enforcement approach. Will US SEC Pause Ripple Lawsuit Next? According to an X post by former SEC official John Reed Stark, the agency may soon put its Ripple lawsuit on hold. Stark highlighted the SEC’s recent decisions to delay legal proceedings against Coinbase and Binance, suggesting that these moves indicate a broader change in enforcement strategy. On Friday, the SEC informed the Second Circuit Court that its new Crypto Task Force could lead to a resolution in its case against Coinbase. This prompted a request for a delay in responding to Coinbase’s appeal regarding whether securities laws apply to transactions on its platform. A similar joint motion was filed in the Binance case last week, requesting a two-month pause in proceedings. Stark emphasized that the SEC’s approach to crypto enforcement is changing, stating that the agency’s crypto-related unit has been rebranded from the “Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit” to the “Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit.” This restructuring suggests a potential slowdown or even a halt in SEC-led crypto investigations and litigation. SEC Crypto Cases Facing Pauses and Settlements The SEC has faced multiple legal challenges in its enforcement actions against major crypto firms, including Ripple, Coinbase, and Binance. However, recent developments indicate that the agency may be shifting away from aggressive litigation ahead of Paul Atkins taking charge of the agency. In the Coinbase case, the SEC and Coinbase jointly requested a delay in court proceedings, citing ongoing regulatory discussions. A similar request was made in the Binance case , where both parties agreed that a temporary pause was necessary while the SEC reevaluates its stance on digital assets. Stark suggested that these delays could lead to broader settlements or dismissals of crypto-related cases. He noted that the SEC’s approach under previous leadership focused on strict enforcement, but the recent changes signal a different direction. He also pointed out that key SEC trial lawyers previously leading these cases have been reassigned, further supporting the idea that the agency is stepping back from its earlier stance. Ripple Lawsuit Likely to Follow the Same Pattern With the SEC pausing its cases against Coinbase and Binance, legal experts believe that the Ripple lawsuit could face a similar fate. Attorney Jeremy Hogan has recently commented on the matter, stating that the SEC may settle its case against Ripple before approving an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). He suggested that a settlement was likely before any ETF approval, reinforcing speculation that the SEC is reconsidering its legal battles with crypto firms. Moreover, with the chances of an XRP ETF approval rising to 80% polymarket and the agency acknowledging three applications so far , the Ripple lawsuit end may be looming. The lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple has been a long-running legal dispute over whether XRP should be classified as a security. A partial court ruling in 2023 determined that XRP was not a security in certain transactions, but the SEC has continued to challenge this decision. If the SEC follows the same pattern as in the Coinbase and Binance cases, and the Elon Musk DOGE investigation on the agency continues, a pause or settlement in the Ripple lawsuit may soon follow.

People with claims exceeding $50,000 will have to wait a bit longer. Their repayments are set to begin in the second quarter of 2025. The key date to watch is April 11, when FTX will confirm claims over $50,000. The actual payouts for this group are scheduled for May 30. To receive funds, creditors must complete Know Your Customer (KYC) verification and submit necessary tax forms. If they miss the deadline, they can still qualify for later distributions. How Much Will Creditors Get? FTX’s recovery estimates suggest that total payouts could reach between $14.46 billion and $16.25 billion. The average recovery rate is projected to be between 123% and 138%, meaning some creditors might even receive more than their original claims. While all secured and customer claims are expected to be fully covered, the exact recovery amount varies due to factors like post-petition interest and remission fund recoveries. FTX’s Impact on Solana (SOL) Price FTX’s bankruptcy has also affected the Solana (SOL) market . The exchange has been offloading its SOL holdings, adding to selling pressure. Last week, its liquidation wallet sent SOL tokens to Binance, pushing prices lower. Additionally, an upcoming unlock of 11.2 million SOL, tied to FTX’s early investments, is expected to add further selling pressure. As a result, SOL’s price has dropped by 10% in a day, bringing it close to $160. With FTX continuing to sell assets, the Solana market remains under pressure.",News,EN,0,0,SOL|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-19 04:58:27

LIBRA, a Solana-based project that President of Argentina Javier Milei tweeted about on Feb. 14, saw its market cap rise as high as $4.5 billion and then fall more than 80% within a couple of hours as insiders cashed out, leaving many bag holders with massive losses. The story became an international and political incident over the weekend when in the last couple of days, Milei deleted his original tweet, denied his endorsement and accused the political opposition of mischief. This eventually led to talks of his impeachment and created uncertainty in the Argentinian stock market. Then came an explosive twist to the story. On Tuesday, CoinDesk broke the news that a key player behind the LIBRA token had bragged about buying access to Argentine President Javier Milei's inner circle months before the memecoin's scandalous launch and crash. Although these kinds of kerfuffle for a memecoin are not unusual, how this happened and what followed after the apparent ""rug pull"" highlighted the risk of unchecked crypto trading and the potential for a reputational hit for the memecoin sector as a whole. ""The LIBRA episode represents what is a potential point of oversaturation for the memecoin space,"" said Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial. ""At this point, the novelty of new projects, after TRUMP and MELANIA, and now LIBRA, has largely worn off."" ""Additionally, the reputational consequences for these assets may be significant. Having said that, it appears that this episode is likely to continue playing out as new details emerge. At this point, memecoins are synonymous with ‘pump and dump’ schemes,"" FRNT contended. This incident, along with other memecoin-related events that led to many retail traders losing money, may nudge the community to make more of an effort to police itself. ""The entire $LIBRA memecoin fiasco over the weekend should serve as a reminder that all of us in the DeFi community have a responsibility to make this space safer for users,"" said Chris Chung, founder of Solana-based swap platform Titan. How the 'fiasco' happened The whole Milei and LIBRA episode played out within the span of a few days, starting on Feb. 14. As explained by Galaxy Research's Alex Thorn, the token launched on that fateful day on a Solana-based DeX Meteora, with Milei's initial post (now deleted) on social media platform X saying that the aim of the token was to help the growth of the Argentinian economy — a big endorsement for a memecoin. Once the token price reached its peak of $4.4 billion within hours, the insiders started dumping their holdings immediately, making nearly $100 million, according to onchain analysts. The next day, Milei deleted his original post, sending a shockwave within the memecoin community, that saw many similar tokens, such as TRUMP, MILANIA, and others, sell out fast. Meanwhile, Solana, the blockchain the token was built on, also saw its native token, SOL, fall. In his new post, Milei claimed he wasn't aware of the details of the project and accused the political opposition of mischief, making the situation a game of politics. By that time, the token had erased around $4.5 billion of retail capital in seven hours. Currently, the market cap sits around just above half a million, according to CoinMarketCap data . The same day, names of a few key opinion leaders (KOL) came up, including Barstool’s Dave Portnoy, Threadguy, Hayden Davis and Faze Banks, who were involved in one way or another with the project. Portnoy said he was an early investor and was refunded his money, further spreading the controversy that insiders benefitted from the LIBRA fiasco. Davis, meanwhile, revealed that he was behind both the LIBRA and MELANIA memecoins and said the Argentinian token incident was ""not a rug pull ,"" rather ""It's just a plan gone miserably wrong."" The next day, the Argentinian opposition threatened Milei with impeachment over the incident. On Feb. 17, Ben Chow, co-founder of DeX Meteora, where LIBRA had launched, resigned over the controversy. Chow was also a co-founder of Solana-based trading aggregator Jupiter. The same day Argentina's stock market collapsed almost 6% on a report of a probe on Milei. Read more: LIBRA Apparent Rug Pull Is Latest 'Sordid Episode' Emerging From Solana's Memecoin Complex: Galaxy On Feb. 18, CoinDesk broke the news that Davis claimed in text messages that he could ""control"" Milei because of payments he had been making to Karina Milei, a powerful figure in Milei's government, and the president's sister. 'Setback for crypto' What will happen to Milei and all the involved parties is still unknown. However, if FTX's spectacular blowout is anything to go by, there might still be a lot more to untangle in this story. What it does highlight is that the memecoin drama that has become a game of split-second profit and losses, in this cycle, might be at a crossroads. As institutional investors are betting big on bitcoin and ether with the launch of exchange-traded funds, making those assets more TradFi friendly and stable, the memecoin sector has stuck out as the ugly duckling of the crypto space, and this incident may sour retail participation. ""Overall, this entire story is a real setback for the crypto space,"" Chung said. ""If we want to attract new retail users, this is not the way to do it.""",Finance|Javier milei|Memecoin|Argentina|market analysis,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-19 04:59:27

Despite strong network activity and continued developer interest, SOL’s short-term performance has left some investors cautious. While Solana experiences a pullback, some traders are looking for new opportunities with higher growth potential. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction, raising over $680,000 in its presale phase this week. The project’s decentralized lending platform and structured tokenomics have attracted early investors looking for substantial returns. With strong demand and ongoing development, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a standout option for those seeking long-term gains in 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) As Solana faces a pullback, investors are turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi project that is already making waves in its presale phase. With over $680,000 raised this week alone, the strong demand for MUTM reflects growing confidence in its long-term potential. Unlike speculative tokens, Mutuum Finance is built on real utility, offering a decentralized lending and borrowing platform that allows users to earn passive income while accessing liquidity without intermediaries. One of the key advantages of Mutuum Finance is its ability to generate sustainable rewards through its lending system. Users who supply assets to the platform receive mtTokens, such as mtUSDT or mtDAI, which accrue interest over time. This model not only benefits lenders with a steady yield but also provides borrowers with a transparent and efficient way to access funds without relying on centralized financial institutions. Mutuum Finance has structured its tokenomics to support long-term price growth and investor rewards. A portion of platform fees will be used to repurchase MUTM tokens, which will then be distributed to mtToken stakers. This buy-and-distribute mechanism ensures continuous demand for MUTM, encouraging long-term holding and increasing the token’s value over time. Additionally, the project is working on an overcollateralized stablecoin, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar on the Ethereum network. This stablecoin will provide users with a reliable way to borrow and transact within the Mutuum ecosystem, reinforcing the platform’s real-world use cases and increasing adoption. With the presale already surpassing $680K and over 1,070 holders participating, investors are securing MUTM at its lowest price of $0.01 before it moves to the next phase at $0.015. Early buyers stand to benefit from substantial returns as the token progresses through its 11 presale phases, leading up to its exchange listing. Experts predict that with the growing investor interest, ongoing development, and planned beta launch of the lending platform, MUTM will experience significant price appreciation post-launch. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a well-structured tokenomics model, with a large portion allocated to the presale, offering early investment opportunities. Other allocations support liquidity, ecosystem development, partnerships, and community incentives. To drive long-term engagement, a share of tokens is dedicated to liquidity mining rewards, benefiting mtToken stakers within the lending platform. Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway to reward early supporters and boost community engagement. Ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, giving them a chance to benefit from the project’s growth before its official launch. Full participation details and rules can be found on the official Mutuum Finance website. As Solana faces short-term volatility, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a promising alternative with a strong foundation in DeFi. With its innovative lending model, structured tokenomics, and increasing investor demand, MUTM is positioning itself as one of the most attractive investment opportunities in 2025.

This new initiative aims to facilitate cross-chain token transfers and message-passing, enhancing the functionality and integration of various blockchain networks. Polygon Market Cap Rebounds To $3.8 Billion According to market intelligence firm Messari, by leveraging zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, Agglayer promises secure communication and asset transfers, positioning itself as an innovative development akin to the introduction of TCP/IP in the early days of the internet. Agglayer is designed to unify disparate blockchain chains by aggregating proofs, verifying chain states, and settling transactions on Ethereum (ETH). Among its critical features are a unified bridge for seamless asset connectivity and a pessimistic proof mechanism that prioritizes safety. These advancements enable low-latency coordination and safe interoperability, allowing developers to concentrate on project design without the burdens of liquidity concerns. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Accumulate—Will This Push BTC Toward $100K? Despite these promising developments, POL’s journey in 2024 has been turbulent. After achieving an all-time high market capitalization of $12.9 billion in Q1, the subsequent quarters saw a sharp decline, with the market cap plummeting to $2.9 billion by the end of Q3, marking a 47.2% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) drop. This downturn was partly due to the ongoing transition from MATIC to POL, which temporarily split market capitalization between the two tokens. However, as market conditions began to stabilize in Q4, the migration of MATIC tokens—1.38 billion in total—into POL resulted in a 31% QoQ increase in POL’s market capitalization, which reached $3.8 billion by the end of the quarter. Notably, 88.1% of the total supply had transitioned to POL, solidifying its position as the largest Ethereum Layer-2 token by market cap. DeFi And NFT Markets Struggle The enactment of EIP-4844 on the Polygon PoS mainnet in Q1 2024 introduced blobs, leading to a significant alteration in the cost structure for users. This update resulted in lower transaction fees, which dropped to just $0.01 during Q4. However, despite the reduced costs, total transactions on the Polygon network fell by 2% QoQ, and active addresses saw a sharp decline of 39.4%, averaging 523,000 daily users. The decrease in activity can be largely attributed to a downturn in the gaming sector, which had previously been a significant driver of user engagement. Average daily gaming active addresses plummeted to 54,000, marking a 66.7% QoQ decline. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Falls Short Again—Is a Deeper Decline Coming? Polygon’s DeFi landscape also faced challenges, with total value locked (TVL) ending Q4 at $871.5 million—down 4.9% QoQ and 2.6% YoY. This decline saw Polygon slip from the tenth largest network by TVL to the twelfth. Moreover, NFT activity on the platform suffered, with average daily trading volume falling to $822,500, down 38.4% QoQ. Average daily NFT sales dropped to 21,000, a staggering 41.5% decrease. The gaming sector, previously the fastest-growing area within Polygon, continued to struggle in Q3 and Q4, largely due to a slowdown in popular titles. POL’s price has also faced notable challenges, with the token recording a significant 67% drop year-to-date as it currently trades at $0.30.

Unlike traditional online casinos that operate with fiat currencies, Bitcoin casinos leverage blockchain technology for faster, more secure, and private transactions. These platforms offer the same exciting games you’d find in traditional casinos—slots, poker, blackjack, roulette, and even live dealer games—while integrating the advantages of cryptocurrency. Why Bitcoin Casinos Are Worth Trying 1. Anonymity and Privacy One of the biggest advantages of Bitcoin casinos is privacy. Unlike traditional casinos that require extensive personal information for registration, many Bitcoin casinos only require an email address and a Bitcoin wallet. This level of anonymity is ideal for players who value their privacy. 2. Fast Transactions Forget waiting for hours or days for deposits and withdrawals. Bitcoin transactions are near-instant, allowing players to fund their accounts and cash out winnings in minutes. 3. Lower Fees Traditional payment methods often come with hefty processing fees. Bitcoin transactions typically have minimal or no fees, ensuring that players keep more of their winnings. 4. Global Access Bitcoin casinos are available worldwide, bypassing many of the restrictions imposed by traditional banking systems. This makes gambling accessible to players in regions with strict regulations. 5. Provably Fair Gaming Blockchain technology ensures transparency in gaming. Many Bitcoin casinos offer provably fair games, allowing players to verify the fairness of every bet they place—something rarely available in traditional casinos. A World of Games at Your Fingertips Bitcoin casinos provide a vast selection of games, from classic slots to blackjack, roulette, and poker. Many also feature live dealer games, where players interact with real dealers in real time. Some platforms even introduce unique blockchain-based games, offering a fresh experience exclusive to cryptocurrency users. Bonuses and Promotions Bitcoin casinos are known for their generous bonuses and promotions, often surpassing what traditional casinos offer. Welcome Bonuses : Many Bitcoin casinos match a percentage of your initial deposit. Free Spins : Additional chances to play without extra investment. VIP & Loyalty Programs : Exclusive rewards for regular players. Cashback Offers : Some platforms provide refunds on losses, giving players more chances to win. Safety and Security Security is a top priority for Bitcoin casinos. These platforms use blockchain technology to secure transactions and prevent tampering. Additionally, reputable casinos implement encryption and other security measures to protect player accounts. To ensure a safe experience, always choose a licensed Bitcoin casino with positive user reviews and provably fair games. Managing Bitcoin’s Volatility Bitcoin’s price can be volatile. While this can lead to increased winnings, it also introduces risk. To manage this, players can convert winnings into stablecoins or fiat currency to protect against sudden price fluctuations. How to Get Started with Bitcoin Casinos Starting with a Bitcoin casino is simple. Here’s how: Set Up a Bitcoin Wallet – Choose a reliable wallet like Coinbase, Exodus, or Ledger. Buy Bitcoin – Purchase Bitcoin through an exchange or peer-to-peer platform. Choose a Bitcoin Casino – Select a reputable casino with good reviews and licensing. Create an Account – Most Bitcoin casinos only require an email for registration. Deposit Bitcoin – Transfer Bitcoin from your wallet to the casino. Start Playing – Explore games, claim bonuses, and enjoy! The Future of Bitcoin Gambling As cryptocurrency adoption grows, Bitcoin casinos are set to become even more popular. Innovations such as decentralized gambling platforms and multi-cryptocurrency support (Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin) are already shaping the future of the industry. By joining a Bitcoin casino now, you’re not just gambling—you’re experiencing the future of online gaming. Why Now Is the Time Bitcoin casinos combine privacy, security, and innovation like no traditional casino can. With fast transactions, generous bonuses, and a vast selection of games, there’s no better time to start. If you’re curious about Bitcoin casinos, now is the perfect time to explore.

These filings mark a major milestone for the cryptocurrency, as the application was previously rejected or withdrawn. In the past, attempts to file for an ETF were met with resistance, especially during the era under SEC Chair Gary Gensler. However, the acknowledgment of these filings is seen as a positive sign, showing that the SEC is open to considering altcoins like XRP and Solana in a way they haven’t before. In a recent podcast, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas said that this development is very important because it suggests that these cryptocurrencies may no longer be classified as securities by the SEC, which would be a game-changer. He quoted someone who speculated that this could eventually lead to the reconsideration of related lawsuits, signaling a shift in how these cryptocurrencies are treated under U.S. law. Litecoin ETF Approval By October 2025? Balchunas also discussed the potential for other altcoins like Dogecoin and Cardano to follow suit, with some filings already underway. While the SEC’s acknowledgment is an encouraging sign, there is still uncertainty about when a final decision will be made. The probability of approval for these ETFs stands at about 70% for XRP. However, he touted Litecoin as one of the most important filings, as it is similar to Bitcoin and viewed as a commodity. Litecoin was filed during the SEC’s previous leadership under Gary Gensler, and unlike other applications, it didn’t receive a call to withdraw, giving it an advantage. With the current, more flexible SEC, Eric believes Litecoin has a 90% chance of approval, with a decision expected by October. While the future of XRP and Solana ETFs is still up in the air, the recent movements indicate that the landscape for cryptocurrency-related financial products is changing, with more filings and decisions expected in the coming months.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,LTC|XRP|REGULATION|SOL|ADA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-19 05:27:26

Stark explained on X that the agency’s broader shift in crypto enforcement strategy signals a fundamental change in its approach, potentially leading to the withdrawal of multiple ongoing cases. SEC’s Changing Stance on Crypto Enforcement Recent developments indicate that the SEC’s enforcement efforts against major cryptocurrency firms are being reassessed. On Friday, the SEC informed the Second Circuit that its newly formed Crypto Task Force may facilitate a resolution in its case against Coinbase, leading the agency to request a brief delay in responding to Coinbase’s appeal. The SEC’s motion cited the need for additional time to conduct an appropriate review of crypto-related issues, suggesting a potential softening of its legal battles against digital asset firms. This move follows a similar request in the Binance case , where the SEC and the crypto exchange jointly asked a federal judge in Washington, D.C., to stay the case for two months. The agency’s newly created task force is expected to play a key role in digital asset regulation, which could directly impact pending litigation. Implications for the Ripple Appeal With the SEC effectively pausing cases against Coinbase and Binance, Stark predicts that the agency will take the same approach with its appeal against Ripple. He believes all crypto-related litigation, including the Ripple appeal, will be put on hold or withdrawn entirely. Stark also pointed to internal shifts within the SEC as further evidence of its changing priorities. Notably, Jorge Tenreiro, a lead litigator in high-profile crypto cases, has been reassigned , signaling a potential retreat from aggressive enforcement actions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, Stark noted that the SEC’s specialized Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit has been rebranded as the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit, further suggesting a shift in focus. New Leadership and Strategic Recalibration The recent changes come in the wake of Mark Uyeda’s appointment as the SEC’s acting chairman on January 20. Under his leadership, the agency appears to be reevaluating its regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies. The creation of the Crypto Task Force and the agency’s willingness to pause major enforcement actions, suggests a shift toward regulatory clarity rather than litigation. Stark predicts that the SEC will significantly scale back its crypto-related enforcement efforts. He expects formal and informal investigations to slow, active litigation to be paused or settled on favorable terms for crypto firms, and ongoing appeals, such as the one against Ripple, to be dropped altogether. He wrote, “The SEC crypto-enforcement is as dead as Julius Caesar.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

RTX Surpasses $12M In Fastest Growing ICO This Year,https://timestabloid.com/could-pepe-sink-back-below-1b-or-is-it-still-destined-for-100b/,"The world of cryptocurrencies is changing, and a fresh PayFi solution is driving it. Although meme coins like PEPE offer conflicting signals, one project that is attracting major interest for its simplicity, speed, and practicality of use of cryptocurrencies. This is the finest coin to invest now with minimal fees, easy transfers, and the possibility to turn over more than forty cryptocurrencies into FIAT . This is a project you want not to miss as analysts forecast a significant increase. PEPE News has even highlighted this shift as a key opportunity in the crypto space. PEPE News: A Big Price Move Ahead? With PEPE displaying an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which could cause a 23% price swing, right now, the token trades for $0.000012 (breakout level) between $0.000008 (support). Should it pass muster, a significant action might follow. Whale activity, though, is producing conflicting indications. Over the past month, big investors raised their holdings by 103.64%; however, short-term whale trading has slumped by 45.77%. This implies some doubt among major players. According to @ali_charts , $0.0000092 is a crucial level for PEPE. If it holds above this level, a rebound could follow. But a break below may open the door for a move toward $0.0000032. Additionally, reducing down market participation is active wallet use, which dropped over 50%, while new wallet creation dropped by 31.72%. Fewer traders interacting with PEPE may hamper its momentum. PEPE’s market capitalization is currently hovering at $3.79 Billion, and its next action will be vital since meme currencies deal with liquidity issues. According to PEPE News , it’s unclear whether the pattern will break through or be hindered by declining activity.

The exchange has announced the removal of five spot trading pairs as part of its regular market review. This change, set to take effect on February 21, 2025, at 03:00 (UTC) where applicable, is aimed at keeping the platform efficient and user-friendly. To mitigate the investor losses such actions are taken regularly by Binance Binance - binance@miceneurol.com Centralised Exchange Cryptocurrencies Trading App Cryptocurrency investment Binance to Remove These Trading Pairs According to Binance, the affected spot trading pairs include, DOGS/BRL, FET/BRL, NEIRO/BRL, NEIRO/EUR, and NOT/EUR. Although these trading pairs will be removed, Binance has clarified that users can still trade these tokens through other active pairs on the platform. For instance, even if a pair like DOGS/BRL is delisted, users can continue trading DOGS and BRL using other available options. For traders using any of the affected pairs, this early notice allows ample time to adjust trading strategies and ensure a smooth transition before February 21st. Fiat Clarification The exchange also clarified that BRL and EUR are fiat currencies and do not represent any digital assets. This means that while these specific pairs are being removed, the affected tokens can still be traded against other cryptocurrencies . Why Binance Removing the Pairs Binance is removing these trading pairs as part of its regular market reviews, likely due to low trading volume and liquidity. When activity is too low, trading becomes inefficient, affecting the overall market experience. While Binance didn’t specify the exact reason, the exchange regularly updates its offerings to ensure a smooth and effective trading environment, keeping only the most viable pairs available. This move aligns with Binance’s goal of maintaining a high-quality market for its users. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Big News: Binance Rejects ‘Sale’ Rumors, Claims Smear Campaign by Rival Exchanges , Impact on Spot Trading Bots The exchange has also announced that Spot Trading Bots services will no longer support these trading pairs after the delisting.

40528215,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=130418,1739943295,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent NZD/USD Forecast: UOB Group Predicts Potential Surge to 0.5790,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/nzd-usd-forecast-potential-surge/,"Is the New Zealand Dollar poised for a powerful surge against the US Dollar? Top analysts at UOB Group suggest exactly that, highlighting a potential climb for NZD/USD to 0.5790. For crypto enthusiasts and Forex traders alike, understanding these traditional market movements can offer crucial insights into broader financial trends and risk assessment. Let’s delve into this exciting Forex forecast and uncover what it means for your trading strategy. Decoding the NZD/USD Forecast: What’s Driving the Optimism? UOB Group’s FX analysts, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, have laid out a compelling case for continued NZD strength. Their analysis, rooted in price action observation, points towards an upward trajectory for the New Zealand Dollar against its US counterpart. This bullish NZD/USD forecast isn’t just a shot in the dark; it’s based on meticulous market observation and trend analysis. But what are the key elements supporting this positive NZD outlook ? Consistent Price Action: The analysts emphasize that recent price movements strongly indicate sustained NZD strength. This isn’t a fleeting moment, but rather a pattern suggesting a continued upward trend. Technical Support Levels: Crucially, the NZD/USD forecast hinges on maintaining levels above a ‘strong support’ point, currently identified at 0.5675. As long as this level holds, the bullish outlook remains intact. Momentum Buildup: To reach the ambitious target of 0.5790, the NZD needs to sustain and build upon its current momentum. This requires consistent positive price action in the coming days and weeks. While the long-term view is decidedly bullish, UOB Group also provides a nuanced short-term perspective, crucial for day-to-day trading decisions. Navigating the Short-Term: Daily Trading Range for NZD/USD In the immediate 24-hour view, UOB Group anticipates a period of range-bound trading for NZD/USD . After an initial attempt to reach 0.5750, which fell slightly short, the currency pair is expected to settle into a more predictable pattern. What does this mean for traders? Expected Trading Range: For today, anticipate NZD/USD to fluctuate between 0.5710 and 0.5745. This narrower range suggests less volatility in the very short term. Range Trading Strategy: Traders can potentially capitalize on this range-bound movement by employing range trading strategies, buying near the support level (0.5710) and selling near the resistance level (0.5745). Monitor Support and Resistance: Keeping a close watch on these levels is vital. A break outside this range could signal a shift in momentum and require adjustments to trading strategies. Here’s a quick summary of the expected trading ranges from UOB Group: Timeframe Expected Range Key Levels 24-Hour View 0.5710 – 0.5745 Support: 0.5710, Resistance: 0.5745 1-3 Weeks View Potentially up to 0.5790 Strong Support: 0.5675, Target: 0.5790 Actionable Insights: How to Leverage the NZD/USD Forecast So, how can traders and investors use this Forex forecast to their advantage? Whether you are trading traditional Forex pairs or exploring the crypto markets, understanding these insights can refine your approach. For Forex Traders: Consider setting limit orders within the anticipated 24-hour range for short-term gains. For a medium-term strategy, monitor if NZD/USD holds above 0.5675 and look for opportunities to enter positions targeting 0.5790. For Crypto Traders: While seemingly distant from crypto, Forex markets often reflect broader economic sentiment. A strengthening NZD against the USD could indicate a general risk-on sentiment in the markets, which can sometimes correlate with positive movements in cryptocurrency markets. Keep an eye on overall market sentiment alongside this UOB Group NZD/USD analysis. Risk Management is Key: Remember, all forecasts are probabilities, not guarantees. Always employ robust risk management strategies, including stop-loss orders, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. The disclaimer from Bitcoin World reminds us to conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved. Challenges and Considerations: Is the 0.5790 Target a Sure Thing? While the NZD outlook is positive, it’s crucial to acknowledge potential challenges and factors that could influence this Forex forecast . No market movement is guaranteed, and various global economic factors can impact currency valuations. Global Economic Events: Unexpected shifts in global economic conditions, such as changes in US monetary policy, New Zealand economic data releases, or geopolitical events, could alter the trajectory of NZD/USD . Market Sentiment Shifts: Overall market sentiment can be fickle. A sudden shift to risk-off mode could strengthen the USD and potentially hinder the NZD’s upward movement. Data Dependency: The forecast is based on current price action and analysis. Future economic data releases from both New Zealand and the US will be critical in validating or invalidating this NZD/USD forecast . Conclusion: Staying Ahead with Informed Forex Analysis The NZD/USD forecast from UOB Group presents an exciting potential opportunity for traders. With a clear target of 0.5790 and defined support levels, it provides a framework for strategic trading decisions. By understanding both the short-term range and the longer-term bullish outlook, traders can better navigate the Forex markets. Remember to stay informed, manage your risk effectively, and continuously adapt your strategies as market conditions evolve. Keep an eye on the dynamic world of Forex and how these movements can offer broader insights into the global financial landscape, potentially even influencing the crypto markets you’re engaged in.

Recently, movements in traditional commodity markets, like copper, can offer insightful signals. Today, we’re diving into the **copper market** as it experiences a significant retreat from recent highs. This isn’t just about metal prices; it’s about global trade dynamics, potential inflation impacts, and what these shifts might foreshadow for the cryptocurrency landscape. Why are Copper Prices Retreating from Three-Month Highs? After hitting a three-month peak, **copper prices** on the London Metal Exchange (LME) have started to pull back. This correction is not happening in isolation; it’s a reaction to a confluence of factors, primarily centered around potential US tariffs and shifts in market dynamics. Let’s break down the key elements: Easing of Backwardation: The benchmark cash-to-three-month spread on the LME, which briefly flipped into backwardation (where spot prices are higher than future prices) for the first time since June 2023, has now eased back into contango (where future prices are higher than spot prices). This shift indicates a change in immediate supply tightness perceptions. Short-Covering and Contract Expiry: According to ING commodity analysts Warren Patterson and Ewa Manthey, short-covering ahead of LME contract expiry, fueled by expectations of US tariffs on copper, triggered a sharp movement in the **copper market** spread last week. This was a temporary squeeze that is now unwinding. US Tariff Threats Looming: Former US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on copper, following similar announcements on aluminum and steel, is a significant driver. While implementation might take time, the mere threat is reshaping market expectations. The Tariff Effect: How US Policy Impacts Global Copper Flow The potential US tariffs are not just a domestic issue; they have ripple effects across the global **commodity prices** landscape. Here’s how: Anticipation of US Market Tightness: The tariff threat is creating an expectation of temporary tightness within the US copper market. Traders are incentivized to move copper from global LME warehouses to the US to capitalize on arbitrage opportunities. Record Premium Surge: The premium for US Comex copper futures over LME contracts skyrocketed to a record high last week, exceeding $1,200 per tonne at one point – over 10% of the LME price. This dramatic surge underscores the market’s immediate reaction to tariff fears. Although this premium has since moderated to above $900, it remains historically elevated. US Import Dependence: The United States relies heavily on imports for its copper consumption, with approximately 45% sourced from abroad. Chile (35%) and Canada (26%) are the primary suppliers. Tariffs would directly impact these import flows and potentially increase costs for US consumers and industries. Bearish Implications: Tariffs, Slowing Growth, and Inflation While seemingly targeted at specific metals, these tariffs carry broader macroeconomic implications that could be bearish for **copper prices** and other industrial metals. Consider these factors: Slowing Global Growth: The backdrop to these trade tensions is a global economy already facing headwinds. Growth in the US is anticipated to slow down partly due to the impact of tariffs. China, a major consumer of copper, is also struggling to reignite its economic engine. Weakened Demand: With economic slowdowns in major economies, the demand for industrial metals like copper is likely to weaken. Copper is a key indicator of economic health due to its widespread use in construction, manufacturing, and technology. Inflationary Pressures: Paradoxically, while tariffs can dampen demand in the long run, they can also contribute to keeping inflation higher for longer in the short to medium term by increasing import costs. This complex interplay adds uncertainty to the economic outlook. LME Copper and the Contango Shift: What Does It Mean? The shift of the LME spread back to contango is a technical but crucial detail. What does it signify for the **LME copper** market? Market Condition Description Implication for Copper Prices Backwardation Spot price higher than future price Indicates immediate supply shortage and strong near-term demand, potentially pushing prices higher in the short term. Contango Future price higher than spot price Suggests ample current supply or expectations of weaker near-term demand, potentially putting downward pressure on spot prices. Also encourages storage as future delivery is more profitable. The return to contango suggests that the immediate tightness in the **LME copper** market, driven by short-covering and tariff anticipation, is easing. This could signal a period of price consolidation or further downward pressure, especially if fundamental demand weakens. Commodity Prices and Cryptocurrency: Are There Connections? While seemingly distinct, commodity markets and cryptocurrency markets are increasingly interconnected. Here’s how events in the **commodity prices** sector, like the copper market retreat, can be relevant to crypto investors: Economic Sentiment Indicator: Commodity prices, particularly industrial metals like copper, are often viewed as leading indicators of economic health. A downturn in copper prices can signal broader economic concerns, which can influence investor sentiment across all markets, including cryptocurrencies. Inflation Hedge Narrative: Both commodities and cryptocurrencies are sometimes considered as potential hedges against inflation. However, the effectiveness of each can vary. If tariffs contribute to ‘stagflation’ (slow growth with high inflation), the response in both commodity and crypto markets could be complex and not always move in perfect tandem. Risk-On/Risk-Off Dynamics: In periods of economic uncertainty driven by trade tensions or slowing growth, investors may shift their risk appetite. Both commodity and cryptocurrency markets can experience volatility during these periods as investors reallocate assets based on perceived risk and opportunity. Navigating Market Uncertainty: Key Takeaways for Investors The current situation in the copper market highlights the interconnectedness of global trade, economic policy, and market sentiment. For investors, particularly those in the cryptocurrency space, here are some crucial takeaways: Monitor Macroeconomic Signals: Pay attention to developments in traditional markets like commodities, as they can provide early warnings or confirmations of broader economic trends that will eventually impact all asset classes, including crypto. Understand Tariff Impacts: Tariffs are not just about specific goods; they are macroeconomic policy tools with wide-ranging consequences for trade flows, inflation, and economic growth. Analyze potential tariff impacts on various sectors and markets. Diversification and Risk Management: In times of uncertainty, diversification across asset classes remains a sound strategy. Be mindful of risk management and adjust portfolio allocations based on your risk tolerance and market outlook. Final Thoughts: Copper’s Dip as a Macro Warning? Copper’s retreat from three-month highs, driven by tariff threats and evolving market dynamics, serves as a potent reminder of the complexities facing the global economy. While the immediate focus is on the **copper market**, the underlying forces at play – trade tensions, growth concerns, and inflationary pressures – have far-reaching implications. For cryptocurrency investors, keeping an eye on these traditional market signals is crucial for navigating the ever-changing economic landscape and making informed investment decisions.

Note this is an authorized but not issued transaction, meaning that this amount will be used as inventory for next period issuance requests and chain swaps.” – Paolo Ardoino , CEO at Tether. Tether’s new mint pushed its USDT supply to over $140 billion, with most of it being on Ethereum ($76.9B) and TRON ($61.7B). Paolo Ardoino, Tether CEO, revealed the company’s attestation for Q4 2024, which indicated that Tether garnered $13.7 billion in profits for the year 2024. The company also gained ~$6 billion in profits for Q4 2024 and $113 billion in direct and indirect holdings. The report also highlighted that the company issued $23 billion USDT in Q4 2024. Ardiono added that Tether had a total issuance of $45 billion USDT for year 2024, which represented almost the entire market cap of the second largest stablecoin. The firm also acknowledged that its USDT reached an impressive milestone of 400 million users globally who were mostly distributed among emerging markets and developing countries. Tether had $7 billion in its excess stablecoin reserves in 2024, which was a 36% increase year over year. According to Ardiono, the Tether Group proprietary equity also surged past $20 billion. Data also showed that Circle resumed USDC minting on Solana after a 7-day pause. The firm has minted a total of $6B USDC on Solana in January and $1.5B in February. SpotOnChain also said that the 7-day break was the longest pause for Circle since previous mints were only up to 4 days apart. The additional $250M USDC is part of Circle’s ongoing efforts to expand the reach and utility of its stablecoin across various blockchain platforms. The firm has been minting several batches of $250M USDC for several weeks. SpotOnChain maintained that the continued endeavor for Circle’s USDC mint was to meet the market-wide demand of the stablecoin. Tether wants to influence how stablecoins are regulated in the U.S. Eleanor Terrett, FoxBusiness journalist, also reported that Tether was working with U.S. lawmakers to influence how fiat-backed currencies are regulated in the U.S. Terrett disclosed that Tether had never received a full audit, but opted to provide quarterly assessments of its financial books from global accounting firm BDO. The journalist revealed that Tether had around 60% of the $230 billion stablecoin market. She also added that the company had become one of the largest holders of U.S. debt in the world, with over $114 billion of short-term Treasury bills in its reserves. Terret highlighted that Congress was working to create legislation that will set a regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S. Ardoino told Terrett that the company was actively engaging with top lawmakers on how to best shape the law. The journalist said that Congressman Bryan Steil had confirmed to Fox Business that Tether had been engaging in the discussion draft of the STABLE Act, which he and Congressman French Hill had introduced last week. According to Terrett, Tether would need to submit to a full monthly audit by a U.S. accounting firm for compliance with proposed regulations. The firm would also be required to maintain one-to-one reserves with assets that are pre-approved by regulators.

Following the release of unexpectedly positive UK labor market data, the British currency staged a notable recovery against major peers. This development has injected a fresh dose of optimism into the market, prompting traders and investors to reassess their positions on GBP, particularly in the popular GBP/USD pair. Let’s delve into the details of this economic upturn and explore what it signifies for the Pound Sterling and the broader financial landscape. UK Labor Market Data: A Beacon of Positivity The Office for National Statistics (ONS) delivered a pleasant surprise with its latest report on the UK labor market data. For the three months leading up to December, the UK economy showcased unexpected strength by adding a substantial 107,000 workers. This figure dwarfs the mere 35,000 jobs added in the preceding September-November period, signaling a significant acceleration in employment growth. Furthermore, the ILO Unemployment Rate remained steady at 4.4%, defying expectations of a rise to 4.5%. This resilience in the face of economic headwinds has been a key driver in the Pound Sterling’s recent resurgence. Here’s a quick look at the key labor market indicators: Indicator Current Reading (Dec) Previous Reading (Nov) Expectation Employment Change +107K +35K N/A Unemployment Rate 4.4% 4.4% 4.5% Average Earnings excl. Bonus 5.9% 5.6% 5.9% Average Earnings incl. Bonus 6.0% 5.6% 5.9% This positive UK labor market data comes at a crucial time, especially considering concerns raised by business owners regarding increased employer contributions to National Insurance. Chancellor Rachel Reeves’s Autumn Budget announcement of a 1.2% increase to 15%, effective from April, had cast a shadow over business sentiment. However, the robust employment figures suggest a degree of underlying economic strength that might mitigate these concerns. Contradictory Signals? BoE’s Dovish Tone vs. Strong Jobs Numbers Interestingly, the upbeat labor data appears to contradict recent comments from Bank of England (BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey. Just a day prior to the data release, Bailey expressed concerns about “some softness” in the labor market during an interview. He also maintained a cautious economic outlook, suggesting that even surprisingly positive Q4 GDP data hadn’t altered the “bigger picture” of sluggish growth. The BoE’s February monetary policy statement had already halved growth forecasts for the year to a mere 0.75%. Adding to the complexity, wage growth figures also exceeded expectations. Average Earnings Excluding bonuses rose to 5.9%, matching forecasts but up from 5.6% previously. Including bonuses, the figure jumped to 6.0%, surpassing both estimates and the prior reading of 5.6%. Sustained high wage growth could fuel inflation worries, potentially limiting the BoE’s flexibility to cut interest rates and potentially forcing them to maintain the current rate of 4.5% for longer than anticipated. GBP/USD Reaction and Market Movers The immediate market reaction to the UK labor market data was a sharp recovery in the Pound Sterling. The GBP/USD pair, which had earlier dipped to near 1.2590 as the US Dollar gained strength, bounced back above 1.2600. While still slightly down on the day, the Pound managed to recoup a significant portion of its intraday losses. Here’s a snapshot of the British Pound’s performance against major currencies today: Currency vs GBP % Change USD GBP/USD -0.14% EUR GBP/EUR 0.11% JPY GBP/JPY 0.23% CAD GBP/CAD -0.07% AUD GBP/AUD -0.07% NZD GBP/NZD 0.39% CHF GBP/CHF -0.15% The US Dollar Index (DXY) also saw a rebound, climbing back to near 107.00 after hitting a two-month low. This Dollar strength is partly attributed to expectations of persistent inflationary pressures stemming from potential economic policies under President Trump’s administration, including proposed tariffs. Furthermore, hawkish comments from Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, suggesting that current interest rates are “in a good place,” have bolstered the Dollar as markets anticipate rates staying higher for longer. Eyes on FOMC Minutes and UK CPI Looking ahead, market participants are keenly awaiting two key events on Wednesday: the UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for January and the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC minutes) from their January meeting. The UK CPI data will be crucial in determining whether inflationary pressures are easing or persisting. A higher-than-expected CPI reading could further strengthen the Pound, as it would reinforce the view that the BoE may need to maintain or even raise interest rates to combat inflation. Conversely, a lower CPI could dampen enthusiasm and potentially lead to a GBP pullback. Simultaneously, the FOMC minutes will provide valuable insights into the Federal Reserve’s thinking regarding monetary policy. Investors will scrutinize the minutes for any clues about the Fed’s future path for interest rates. Any hints of a more hawkish stance, suggesting rates could remain elevated for an extended period, would likely further support the US Dollar, potentially putting downward pressure on GBP/USD. Technical Outlook for GBP/USD From a technical perspective, the GBP/USD pair is currently attempting to establish a firm footing above the 1.2600 level. The near-term outlook appears to be turning bullish as the pair holds above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) around 1.2500. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also comfortably above 60.00, suggesting positive momentum. A sustained RSI above 60.00 could signal further upside potential. Key technical levels to watch: Support: 1.2500 (50-day EMA), 1.2250 (February 3 low) Resistance: 1.2810 (December 6 high) Conclusion: Sterling’s Strength Faces Upcoming Hurdles The Pound Sterling’s recent recovery, fueled by surprisingly robust UK labor market data, offers a glimmer of hope for bulls. However, the currency’s upward trajectory is not without its challenges. Contradictory signals from the BoE, coupled with looming inflation data and the highly anticipated FOMC minutes, create a complex and potentially volatile environment for GBP/USD. Traders should remain vigilant and closely monitor these upcoming events to gauge the Pound’s true strength and future direction in the Forex arena. The interplay between domestic economic data, central bank rhetoric, and global market sentiment will be crucial in determining whether this Pound Sterling surge can be sustained or if it’s merely a temporary reprieve.

With links to CZ, both these tokens have plummeted 60-80% from their peak over the past week, creating major market panic. Binance Founder CZ to Donate to TST and BROCCOLI Victims Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has recently landed in the middle of the meme coin frenzy by building hype around his dog name BROCCOLI , which led to the creation of several meme coins under this name thereby triggering a major pump and dump. Although the meme coin CZ’s Dog BROCCOLI price shot up by 160% initially on launch, the token has plummeted more than 75% from the peak causing a large number of investors to lose money in FOMO. CZ has now decided to do some course reversal by helping the victims of these meme coins. On Tuesday, the Binance founder donated a total of 150 BNB worth around $100,000 to a university student who had already contributed $50,000 of his own funds to assist victims of the Libra project. Furthermore, CZ noted that this student appeared to have made substantial gains from BNB investments. Interestingly, the address where Zhao sent his donation has since received more BNB than his initial contribution, along with additional tokens. He said that he wouldn’t keep any of these funds and would rather donate to the victims of TST token and BROCCOLI meme coin. In his message on X platform , the Binance founder wrote: “I won’t be keeping a satoshi of it. Will donate it away, most likely to people who had a loss on TST or some of the Broccolis. This is NOT an endorsement for any of the tokens. Do NOT overinterpret this.” “When you try to make quick money, you often lose. When you give money away, you get more back,” he added. Caught in the Meme Coin Frenzy The Binance founder finds himself caught in the middle of a meme coin frenzy after he shared an educational video of BNB Chain last week, which featured a Test (TST) token as an example. This led to the creation of TST meme coin that witnessed huge trading activity. However, Zhao has completely distanced himself from this development. The TST price is down more than 52% over the past week, with daily trading volumes shooting 48% to more than $205 million. Zhao also shared his recent views on the pump and dump in LIBRA tokens , endorsed by Argentinian President Javier Milei. In his post, CZ emphasized the importance of caution for industry figures with influential online profiles when endorsing tokens. He pointed out that the tokenomics of any asset plays a critical role in its overall value and sustainability.

The Senate confirmed Lutnick with a 51-45 vote conducted on Tuesday, Feb. 18, according to The New York Times . The former CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick, has been a strong proponent of Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether ( USDT ). Bitcoin “should be free to trade everywhere in the world,” Lutnick has previously stated, likening it to gold. He defended Tether’s USDT reserves at the Bitcoin Conference 2024, saying that they were fully backed by gold, Bitcoin, and U.S. Treasuries. He also pushed back against concerns about stablecoins’ role in illegal funding during his Senate confirmation hearing. Given that the SEC is reviewing applications for staking in Ethereum ETFs, his appointment may influence a change in the Commerce Department’s position on digital assets. You might also like: Ripple updates: SEC acknowledges Grayscale’s XRP ETF filing Beyond cryptocurrency, Lutnick will be crucial to Trump’s assertive trade ambitions. He refuted arguments that tariffs cause inflation, calling them “nonsense,” and defended the use of tariffs as a weapon to compel trading partners into reducing trade barriers. His position supports Trump’s call for higher tariffs fees to safeguard American businesses. Trump’s push for higher tariffs has come under fire from conservative economists who claim that tariffs increase prices for American consumers. Lutnick left Cantor Fitzgerald to adhere to federal ethics regulations. Cantor has strengthened his connections with the cryptocurrency sector by offering custody services to Tether. He will lead a department of more than 50,000 workers in his role as Commerce Secretary, a position in which he will manage trade policies, technological exports, and economic regulations. Crypto enthusiasts and Trump’s larger economic objectives could both benefit from his confirmation. But his pro-tariff position might worsen tensions with U.S. trading partners, which would likely lead to new trade negotiations.

All eyes are on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) as it gears up to announce its first monetary policy decision of 2025 on Tuesday. The buzz in the market? A widely anticipated RBA interest rate cut – the first in over four years. But what does this mean for your crypto portfolio and the broader markets? Let’s dive deep into what’s expected and the potential ripple effects. Will the RBA Deliver the First Interest Rate Cut? For months, the RBA has held the Official Cash Rate (OCR) steady at 4.35%, battling stubbornly high inflation. But the tide may be turning. Australian core inflation has shown signs of easing, albeit remaining above the RBA’s target. This delicate balance between inflation and economic pressure is now forcing the RBA’s hand. Market participants are overwhelmingly predicting a 25 basis points (bps) cut to the RBA interest rate . This move is seen as a response to the growing concerns about household and business strain amidst sluggish economic growth. Here’s a quick rundown of the key factors influencing this anticipated decision: Easing Inflation: The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data revealed a slower-than-expected inflation rise in the last quarter of 2024. The RBA’s preferred Trimmed Mean CPI also showed a deceleration, fueling expectations for a rate cut. Economic Growth Concerns: Sustained high interest rates are starting to bite, impacting economic activity. Policymakers are under pressure to stimulate growth. Solid Employment Growth (A Balancing Act): While inflation is showing signs of cooling, robust employment growth presents a counterargument against aggressive rate cuts. Strong job numbers can indicate a still-resilient economy, potentially reigniting inflationary pressures. Australian Dollar on Edge Ahead of Decision The Australian Dollar (AUD) is currently in a state of consolidation against the US Dollar, holding onto recent gains. Traders are keenly watching for signals from the RBA’s announcement. The currency’s reaction will heavily depend on the magnitude of the rate cut and, crucially, the RBA’s forward guidance. Consider these potential scenarios and their impact on the AUD/USD: Scenario RBA Action Potential AUD/USD Impact Expected Cut 25 bps interest rate cut Moderate AUD selling pressure, depends on forward guidance. Dovish Surprise 50 bps interest rate cut or hints at aggressive future cuts Significant bearish pressure on AUD. Hawkish Cut 25 bps cut but signals slow easing cycle Potential AUD strength, perceived as less dovish than expected. Expert Insight: Valeria Bednarik on AUD/USD Outlook Valeria Bednarik, Chief Analyst at Bitcoin World, offers her technical perspective on the Australian Dollar : “The AUD/USD pair peaked at 0.6373 ahead of the announcement, its highest since mid-December. Technically, the pair remains bullish, supported by broad US Dollar weakness. The Greenback is under pressure as markets react to concerns about US fiscal policy and the Federal Reserve’s stance.” Bednarik further adds, “Uncertainty surrounding potential US tariffs and their impact on the Australian economy is also likely on the RBA’s radar. Technically, AUD/USD has room to advance towards 0.6470, but faces immediate resistance at its recent high of 0.6373 and then 0.6430. A dovish RBA outcome could trigger a fall below 0.6300, potentially extending down to 0.6230.” Decoding the Monetary Policy Decision and Press Conference The RBA’s monetary policy decision goes beyond just the interest rate cut figure. Governor Michele Bullock’s press conference following the announcement will be crucial. Market participants will be dissecting her words for clues about the future path of interest rates. Is this the start of a series of cuts, or a cautious one-off adjustment? Key questions to watch for during the press conference: Future Guidance: Will the RBA signal further rate cuts are likely, or emphasize a data-dependent approach? Inflation Outlook: How concerned is the RBA about persistent inflation, and what are their expectations for it returning to the target band? Economic Growth Assessment: What is the RBA’s assessment of the current economic slowdown and the need for further stimulus? Frequently Asked Questions: Understanding the Australian Dollar What key factors drive the Australian Dollar ? The Australian Dollar’s value is influenced by a mix of factors, including: RBA Interest Rates: Higher rates generally attract foreign investment, boosting the AUD. Commodity Prices (Iron Ore): As a resource-rich nation, Australia’s export prices, particularly iron ore, significantly impact the AUD. Chinese Economy: China’s economic health, being Australia’s largest trading partner, directly affects demand for Australian exports and the AUD. Domestic Economic Health: Inflation, employment, and economic growth within Australia are crucial determinants. Market Sentiment: Global risk appetite influences the AUD, often seen as a risk-on currency. How do RBA decisions impact the Australian Dollar ? The RBA’s primary tool is setting the interest rate . By adjusting rates, they aim to manage inflation and influence economic activity. Higher rates tend to strengthen the AUD, while lower rates can weaken it. Quantitative easing (QE) and tightening also play a role, with QE typically weakening the AUD and tightening strengthening it. How does the Chinese economy impact the Australian Dollar ? China’s robust economic growth translates to increased demand for Australian resources, boosting the Australian Dollar . Conversely, a slowdown in China can dampen demand and weigh on the AUD. Chinese economic data releases often trigger reactions in the AUD market. How does the price of Iron Ore impact the Australian Dollar ? Iron ore is Australia’s top export. Rising iron ore prices increase demand for the Australian Dollar as buyers need AUD to purchase the commodity. This positive correlation means iron ore price fluctuations are a key driver for the AUD. How does the Trade Balance impact the Australian Dollar ? A positive Trade Balance (exports exceeding imports) signifies strong demand for Australian goods and services. This naturally increases demand for the Australian Dollar , pushing its value higher. A negative Trade Balance can have the opposite effect. Economic Indicator: RBA Press Conference The RBA Governor’s press conference is a vital event for understanding the central bank’s thinking and future policy direction. A hawkish tone, suggesting further rate hikes or a slower pace of easing, can strengthen the Australian Dollar . Conversely, a dovish message, indicating more aggressive rate cuts or concerns about economic weakness, can weaken the AUD. Keep an eye on the next press conference scheduled for Tue Feb 18, 2025, at 04:30 GMT.

The recent scoop reveals his sister, Karina Milei, was allegedly paid to influence him in promoting the Libra (LIBRA) token, raising more doubts and concerns for crypto investors. This revelation has sparked political turmoil, with opposition leaders calling for his impeachment over potential misconduct. Karina Milei, a key figure in Argentina’s government and General Secretary of the Presidency, has remained silent as controversy grabs eyeballs around the LIBRA token scandal. While it’s unclear if any money changed hands, leaked messages suggest Hayden Davis, the man behind the token, claimed he could pay Milei’s inner circle for influence. This adds new fuel to an anti-corruption probe into President Javier Milei, who previously promoted LIBRA as a funding tool for small businesses. Leaked Messages Raise Questions According to La Nacion, Hayden Davis, CEO of Kelsier Ventures and linked to the LIBRA token, reportedly sent messages claiming he had control over Milei through his sister. In the messages, Davis allegedly stated, “I send $$ to his sister, and he does whatever I say.” He also suggested he could arrange a personal meeting with Milei to promote the token. However, Davis has denied these claims, saying he doesn’t recall sending the messages and has no record of them on his phone. He also insisted that neither Javier nor Karina Milei received any money from him. LIBRA Token’s Rise and Fall LIBRA had a massive launch, reaching a $4.5 billion market cap at its peak. However, the token quickly crashed by 95% , causing huge losses for investors. Reports suggest Davis and Kelsier Ventures made nearly $100 million from the launch. Davis, however, maintains that he never owned or sold the tokens. Milei’s Response In an interview with Todo Noticias, Milei denied promoting the token and instead said he merely “spread the word” about it. He insisted he had “nothing to hide” and acted “in good faith” but admitted he needs to be more cautious in the future. Milei emphasized that the government had no involvement in the LIBRA situation, stating, “The state plays no role here.” However, the controversy has already damaged his reputation, with critics accusing him of misleading the public. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Argentina’s Javier Milei Faces Fraud Charges After LIBRA Crypto Rug Pull Scandal , Political Fallout With opposition leaders pushing for impeachment, this scandal could become a major political challenge for Milei.

In the meanwhile Milei is already facing a lawsuit filed after many legal complaints of crypto losses due to his actions. As the dust settles, Milei’s political future remains uncertain. Whether this controversy fades or escalates depends on how the public and lawmakers react to the allegations in the coming weeks. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In Norway, four men have been charged with orchestrating an $80 million investment fraud, allegedly laundering funds through a law firm’s accounts. Meanwhile, Abstract is investigating reports of a wallet drain affecting some users, with early findings pointing to a third-party application rather than a flaw in its core infrastructure. Norwegian Authorities Charge Four Men in Alleged $80 Million Crypto Investment Scam In a significant crackdown on financial fraud, Norwegian authorities have charged four men for allegedly orchestrating a large-scale cryptocurrency investment scam that defrauded thousands of investors worldwide. The scheme, which reportedly amassed over 900 million Norwegian kroner ($80 million), allegedly funneled illicit funds through a law firm’s accounts to obscure its origins. Norway’s National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime, known as Økokrim, announced the charges on Feb. 16, detailing the intricate web of deception that lured in unsuspecting investors. According to Økokrim state prosecutor Joakim Ziesler Berge, the case represents one of the largest investment frauds to have affected international investors in recent years. “We believe this is a large and extensive fraud,” Berge said. “We are talking about a large number of victims in many countries who have lost their money and significant sums that have ended up with the defendants.” Økokrim alleges that victims were misled into believing they were investing in a highly profitable business that claimed to hold significant assets in gas, mining operations, and real estate. Investors were enticed by promises of lucrative returns, backed by what appeared to be a well-structured financial venture. However, the reality was starkly different. The scheme made no significant investments beyond the collected deposits and had no actual earnings. Instead, funds were cycled through a classic Ponzi-like structure where existing investors were encouraged to recruit new participants, further expanding the web of deception. To further conceal the illicit proceeds, Norwegian authorities claim that over 700 million Norwegian kroner ($62 million) was laundered through a Norwegian law firm’s accounts, as well as multiple corporate entities based in Asia. This strategic layering of funds, Økokrim noted, significantly complicated efforts to track and recover the money. “The use of client accounts and company structures in Norway and internationally has complicated the work of uncovering what happened to the money,” said Økokrim in a statement. Money laundering through law firms and shell companies is a well-documented tactic used by financial criminals to obscure the origins of illicit funds. By channeling stolen funds through legitimate business entities, fraudsters can effectively disguise the money trail, making it harder for authorities to trace and seize assets. The four accused men, aged between their 50s and 70s, are all Norwegian nationals and are believed to have run the fraudulent operation from March 2015 to November 2018. According to Norwegian media outlet NRK, three of the accused are facing charges related to the fraudulent collection of investment funds, while the fourth individual has been charged with money laundering. One of the defendants, represented by Christian Flemmen Johansen of Flemmen & Co Law Firm, has denied all allegations, asserting his client had no involvement in fraudulent activities. Similarly, another defendant’s lawyer, Ole Petter Drevland, stated that his client rejects any criminal responsibility in the case. Information regarding the legal representation of the other two defendants has yet to be disclosed. Despite the denials, Norwegian authorities remain steadfast in their pursuit of justice, emphasizing the scale of financial losses and the international scope of the fraudulent operation. A Widespread Issue in the Crypto Space The Norwegian case echoes similar high-profile cryptocurrency fraud cases worldwide. One of the most infamous cases is the BitConnect Ponzi scheme, where Indian authorities recently seized $190 million in crypto assets linked to fraudulent activities. Cryptocurrency-based Ponzi and pyramid schemes remain a persistent challenge for regulators. These scams often rely on exaggerated profit promises, targeting both retail and institutional investors with sophisticated marketing tactics. The digital nature of crypto transactions further complicates law enforcement efforts, as fraudsters exploit cross-border financial networks to conceal illicit gains. The case is set to go to trial in Oslo District Court in September and is expected to span over 60 days, reflecting the complexity and volume of evidence involved. If convicted, the defendants could face severe financial penalties and lengthy prison sentences under Norwegian fraud and money laundering laws. As the investigation unfolds, authorities are likely to trace additional assets, and investors worldwide will be watching closely in hopes of recovering lost funds. With crypto-related financial crimes on the rise, the case shows the importance of investor due diligence and regulatory oversight in an increasingly digitized financial landscape. While cryptocurrencies offer innovative financial solutions, they also provide fertile ground for fraudulent schemes when left unchecked. The Norwegian case serves as a cautionary tale for investors to thoroughly vet investment opportunities, particularly those promising unrealistically high returns. As financial regulators and law enforcement agencies continue strengthening their oversight of the crypto industry, cases like this highlight the urgent need for greater transparency and accountability in digital asset markets. The Oslo trial will likely set a precedent for how similar crypto fraud cases are handled in Norway and beyond, as authorities work to dismantle fraudulent operations and protect investors from financial exploitation in the evolving world of digital finance. Ethereum Layer-2 Platform Abstract Investigates Wallet Drain Issue Following Major Milestone In other news, Ethereum Layer-2 (L2) scaling solution Abstract is currently investigating reports of a wallet drain incident, after some users reported unauthorized fund withdrawals from their accounts. The issue, which appears to be linked to a single application rather than a platform-wide vulnerability, surfaced just a day after the project celebrated a significant milestone—the deployment of over 1 million Abstract Global Wallets (AGW). On Feb. 18, a developer from the Abstract Chain team, 0xBeans, alerted the community via X that some Abstract users had been affected by a wallet compromise. However, they were quick to clarify that the issue was not a fundamental flaw with AGW wallets but rather an incident affecting a specific application within the ecosystem. “Seems to be Cardex, please do not interact for the time being,” 0xBeans wrote, pointing at the Cardex game—an Abstract-based application—as a possible source of the vulnerability. The announcement came just a day after another developer, 0xCygaar, proudly announced that Abstract had deployed over 1 million AGW wallets, making it one of the leading smart wallet providers in the Ethereum L2 ecosystem. “We’ve done more than almost anyone else in the space to bring on the next generation of smart wallets,” 0xCygaar posted on Feb. 17, adding, “We’re just getting started.” Following concerns from the community, 0xCygaar reiterated that the security breach was not related to Abstract’s wallet contracts or infrastructure but rather to session key mismanagement in Cardex. “This is not an issue with AGW’s contracts. There is no exploit with wallet functionality,” 0xCygaar stated. “This specific issue is related to negligence on the app regarding session key management.” He further reassured the community that Abstract’s contracts had undergone multiple security audits, including a specific review of the session key module—an integral component of AGW wallets. “We had our session key module looked at specifically. These reports will be available shortly,” he added. Despite Abstract’s assurances, the crypto community remains on edge, with some users questioning whether other applications within the ecosystem could pose similar risks. One of the main concerns stems from Abstract’s past promotion of Cardex. Some users have accused the project of endorsing the application, potentially misleading investors and users into trusting it. “You promoted Cardex on the website and official X account following them! It’s your fault!” one frustrated user wrote, demanding accountability from the Abstract team. However, as of now, Cardex does not appear anywhere on Abstract’s official website or blog, raising further questions about the nature of its association with the project. Additionally, some users have reported losing funds despite never interacting with Cardex, leading to speculation that the breach may not be as contained as initially thought. A Setback Following Abstract’s Mainnet Launch The wallet drain incident comes less than a month after Abstract launched its mainnet on Jan. 27. The project, created by Igloo—the parent company behind the well-known NFT brand Pudgy Penguins—has been one of the most ambitious Layer-2 initiatives in the Ethereum space. Back in July 2024, Igloo successfully raised $11 million in funding to build Abstract, with the goal of making smart wallets more accessible and enhancing security in decentralized applications (dApps). This latest setback is a stark reminder of the security challenges that still plague the cryptocurrency ecosystem, particularly when it comes to third-party applications leveraging blockchain infrastructure. While Abstract developers have assured users that the core AGW wallet infrastructure remains secure, the team is still investigating the full scope of the breach and its potential impact on the broader Abstract ecosystem. For now, users are being urged to revoke session keys associated with Cardex and exercise caution when interacting with third-party applications built on Abstract. As the investigation unfolds, the crypto community will be watching closely to see whether Abstract can contain the issue and rebuild trust after this security scare. Given the platform’s ambitious plans and its rapid growth, ensuring robust security measures will be crucial for maintaining its position in the competitive Ethereum Layer-2 market. This incident is yet another reminder that even well-audited blockchain systems can be vulnerable to third-party application exploits, emphasizing the need for constant vigilance and improved security standards in the DeFi and Web3 space.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ZRX|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-19 06:00:00

Ethereum Social Dominance Has Shot Up Over The Past Day According to data from the analytics firm Santiment , the Ethereum Social Dominance has just seen a significant increase. The “ Social Dominance ” here refers to an indicator that’s based on another metric known as the Social Volume. The Social Volume basically tells us about the amount of discussion that a given topic or term is receiving on the major social media platforms. The metric calculates its value by counting up the unique total number of posts/messages/threads on these platforms making mentions of the term. It might seem odd that the metric doesn’t just count up the mentions themselves, but the reason behind it is that the other methodology can sometimes paint an inaccurate picture of the situation on social media. This can happen when there isn’t much activity present on the platforms, but there are a few posts from enthusiasts up. Such posts can contain a notable number of mentions, enough to skew the Social Volume by themselves. By tracking only the posts themselves, the indicator only spikes when the discussion is more spread out across social media (that is, there are a high number of users participating in talks). Now, the actual indicator of relevance here, the Social Dominance, determines what part of cryptocurrency-related discussions that any given token is accounting for. The metric makes use of the Social Volume of the asset and that of the top 100 coins by market cap to make the comparison. Below is the chart shared by Santiment, which shows the trend in the Social Dominance for Ethereum over the last few months: As is visible in the graph, the Ethereum Social Dominance has just observed a spike, meaning that the share of social media discussions occupied by the asset has shot up. Following this increase, the indicator is now sitting at 9.2%, which means almost a tenth of the discussions related to the cryptocurrency sector involve ETH in some form. The asset’s price has been struggling recently, so this renewed interest from social media users may be a positive sign for things to come in the week. The trend in Social Dominance isn’t the only bullish development that Ethereum has seen, as the data of the other indicator attached in the chart by the analytics firm shows. It appears that the Supply On Exchanges have plunged during the last couple of weeks, which suggests the investors have been making net withdrawals of the coin from the centralized exchanges. In total, 0.83% of the ETH supply has left exchanges in this period, leaving just 6.38% still sitting on these platforms. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2,700, up 1% in the last week.",Ethereum|ETH|Ethereum Rebound|Ethereum Social Dominance|Ethereum Social Media|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-19 06:00:18

He noted that many investors are selling their holdings out of panic rather than focusing on long-term potential. Farina said such short-term reactions could lead to significant missed opportunities, especially if XRP eventually reaches a three-digit valuation. He believes that major financial institutions, including Wall Street firms, Grayscale, and BlackRock, may later seek to acquire XRP at much higher prices, possibly from those who held on through volatility. Retail is panicking, selling $XRP for a 5% dip. But when the market flips and $XRP becomes the new standard, they'll be begging to buy it back from you at 3 digits. Wall Street, Grayscale, BlackRock, they’ll be on their knees, crying for what you HODL! DON'T GIVE IT FOR FREE! — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) February 18, 2025 Other cryptocurrency enthusiasts share similar views. Sergei Ermolov commented , “If people panic when XRP dropped by 5%, I have nothing to say to them. In a year, they will remember when they sold the treasure because of the 5% drawdown.” Another user, Silveraddict, emphasized the importance of a long-term strategy, stating , “You can’t be bothered with the day-to-day action. The powers that be know what they are doing, playing on your emotions. Buy it, put it in cold storage, and wait patiently. It will hit, and when it does, you will forget about all the waiting.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Current Market Position As of February 18, 2025, data from CoinMarketCap shows that XRP is trading at $2.54, marking a 3.04% decrease from the previous close. The cryptocurrency experienced an intraday high of $2.68 and a low of $2.54. These fluctuations highlight the inherent volatility in the digital asset market, where short-term price movements often lead to reactive trading behavior. XRP Long-Term Adoption and Future Valuation Farina has expressed strong confidence in XRP’s long-term potential. He predicted that the asset could be widely adopted by banks, governments, and retail users globally within five years. He also envisions a future where commodities such as gold are tokenized on the XRP Ledger, reinforcing its utility in the financial sector. Additionally, Farina believes that Ripple , the company utilizing XRP, could evolve into a multi-trillion-dollar entity. He said in such a scenario, purchasing XRP at $500 could be a favorable investment. This perspective aligns with his advocacy for a patient and disciplined investment strategy.

Investors who hesitated during XRP’s climb are now racing toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending platform whose presale has already raised $774,320.3 in its opening phase. With 1,320 holders onboard and 70% of phase one tokens claimed, Mutuum Finance is emerging as the crypto market’s latest magnet for those chasing explosive returns. Mutuum Finance Attracts Missed Opportunity Investors As XRP’s price leaped from $0.60 to $2.86 following Forbes’ criticism, latecomers watched gains slip away. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now offers a similar opportunity, priced at just $0.01 during its initial presale phase. Early participants stand to secure a 600% profit at launch, with the token expected to hit $0.06 once listed. Beyond that, analysts highlight a post-launch target of $1 in 2025, a 100x leap from today’s entry point. This potential has triggered a rush, as phase one edges closer to selling out. Operating as a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol, Mutuum Finance enables users to earn passive income or access liquidity without selling assets. Lenders deposit tokens like USDT into pools, earning adjustable interest rates tied to demand. Borrowers, meanwhile, collateralize holdings such as ETH to secure loans, retaining ownership while unlocking funds. The platform supports both peer-to-contract (P2C) transactions via audited smart contracts and peer-to-peer (P2P) deals, offering flexibility and security. Adding to its appeal, Mutuum Finance plans to launch an overcollateralized stablecoin, backed fully by on-chain reserves. This feature aims to stabilize borrowing options and amplify utility, positioning MUTM as more than a speculative asset. Presale Momentum Builds Rapidly Mutuum Finance’s presale has gained speed since launching, with phase one tokens vanishing swiftly. Investors recognize the window for maximum returns is narrowing: each subsequent phase increases the token price before its $0.06 debut. Those buying now at $0.01 could see investments grow sixfold at launch. Comparatively, XRP’s 9x surge since 2023 pales next to MUTM’s short-term potential. Beyond financial mechanics, Mutuum Finance prioritizes community growth. The ongoing $100,000 giveaway targets 10 winners, requiring only social media engagement for entry. Such initiatives mirror tactics used by successful predecessors, fostering loyalty ahead of major milestones. Additionally, the beta platform’s imminent release ensures operational readiness at launch, an advantage many presale projects lack. Analysts Predict 100x Growth by 2025 Market experts point to Mutuum Finance’s structured ecosystem as the catalyst for long-term growth. The platform’s buy-and-distribute mechanism will channel fees into purchasing MUTM from open markets, redistributing tokens to stakers. This creates constant demand, steadily lifting prices. Combined with the stablecoin’s launch and expanding user base, MUTM’s path to $1 in 2025 appears grounded in tangible use, not hype. For investors sidelined during XRP’s rise, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a second chance with higher stakes. Phase one’s $0.01 price, the lowest available, offers a fleeting entry before escalations begin. With 600% gains at launch and a $1 forecast within two years, the project merges short-term profit with enduring utility. Mutuum Finance is positioning itself not as a speculative gamble, but a calculated investment in decentralized finance’s future. The presale’s rapid progress signals widening recognition: those delaying risk missing the next major surge. Secure MUTM tokens today, before phase one closes and prices climb irrevocably. Time is critical as Mutuum Finance’s opening presale phase nears completion. Investors seeking transformative returns in 2024 and beyond are swiftly claiming positions. With XRP’s skeptics still counting losses from hesitation, MUTM offers a clear lesson: early action unlocks unparalleled rewards.

He announced that he would discuss a “DOGE Dividend” with former President Donald Trump, providing a $5,000 tax refund to every taxpayer. However, in a surprising twist, the White House has denied that Musk is in charge of DOGE, raising questions about his influence over the program. Musk’s $5,000 Tax Refund Proposal The “DOGE Dividend” has taken the internet by storm, with many wondering if they could soon receive an extra $5,000 in their tax refunds However, the proposal stems from Azoria CEO James Fishback’s suggestion that DOGE has saved around $400 billion. He proposed using about 20% of these savings, roughly $50–$55 billion, to distribute among 79 million taxpayers, giving each a $5,000 rebate. This money would come from billions of dollars saved by reducing government waste. DOGE has reportedly cut costs through fraud detection, eliminating unneeded programs, and canceling overpriced contracts. Musk responded to this on X stating that he plans to discuss this proposal with former President Donald Trump. Will check with the President — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 18, 2025 Is Musk Leading DOGE? Despite Musk’s strong push for government savings, the White House recently clarified that he is not in charge of DOGE . Many believed he was the head of the program, but officials now state that he is only a consultant. This means he does not have the power to make final decisions about tax refunds or any other government actions. While this proposal is gaining attention, there is no official confirmation that the government will distribute these checks. The idea remains in discussion, and Musk has said he will take it up with Trump. What Happens Next? Since Trump took office as the 47th President, Musk has been involved in government cost-cutting efforts. He has repeatedly emphasized the need to remove wasteful spending and improve efficiency.

According to its latest report, Bitcoin is down a modest 2% for the week as risk-averse traders drive down returns, volatility, and trading volumes. Vetle Lunde, K33’s Director of Research, noted that while a pro-crypto Trump Administration offers long-term positives for Bitcoin and the broader industry, current uncertainty is suppressing market activity. “Bitcoin metrics are softening across every corner of the market. Volumes, yields, option premiums and ETF flows have moved to areas not seen since before the election. Alongside these muted conditions, volatility has also slowed to its lowest levels in months,” Lunde said in a statement. Lunde also noted that 37% of the top 100 U.S. companies currently exhibit higher 30-day volatility than Bitcoin, a phenomenon last seen in October 2023. However, he cautioned that these periods of low volatility tend to be short-lived, urging investors to prepare for potential market upheavals. Related News: BREAKING: Following Today's Distributions, FTX Sets Date for Next Major Creditor Repayments “While the general risk aversion trend suggests that investors are prepared for downside volatility, moderate leverage levels suggest that liquidity chains currently carry less risk,” Lunde added. Lunde’s analysis of CME Bitcoin Futures points to a possible shift in the market. Lunde noted that futures premiums have historically fallen below 5%, a rare occurrence. Examining data from 2021 to 2025, K33 found that lower futures premiums generally coincide with weaker Bitcoin market performance and are likely influenced by a prolonged bear market in 2022. In futures, the basis is the difference between the futures price and the spot price. A premium occurs when futures prices exceed spot prices and generally indicates bullish sentiment, while a discount indicates bearish conditions. Lunde emphasized that Bitcoin performs best in a strong base regime and advised caution given the current market uncertainty. “Given the current uncertainty, we advise caution until a clear directional signal emerges,” Lunde concluded. *This is not investment advice.

Just days after a mysterious deletion, Milei doubled down on his apparent endorsement of LIBRA, a relatively lesser-known cryptocurrency, by retweeting a tutorial on how to acquire it. This unexpected move, initially flagged by crypto-watcher Solid Intel (@solidintel_x) on X, has not only validated LIBRA in the eyes of many but also seemingly triggered a buying frenzy, exemplified by one savvy trader turning a multi-million dollar profit. Is this the dawn of mainstream meme coin adoption, fueled by presidential tweets? Let’s dive into the details of this fascinating crypto saga. Argentine President’s Explosive Crypto Endorsement Javier Milei, known for his unconventional and often libertarian-leaning political stances, has once again proven his penchant for disrupting the status quo. His actions in the digital currency space are no exception. The initial tweet, endorsing LIBRA, vanished as quickly as it appeared, leaving many to speculate whether it was a genuine endorsement or a social media mishap. However, the subsequent retweet of a tutorial on how to buy LIBRA leaves little room for doubt: President Milei is seemingly throwing his weight behind this particular digital asset. This public display of support from a head of state is particularly noteworthy in the often volatile and still somewhat nascent world of cryptocurrency. It raises several key questions: What is LIBRA? For those unfamiliar, LIBRA is a cryptocurrency that has recently gained traction, particularly within certain online communities. While details about its technology and use cases may vary depending on the specific token being referenced (as the name ‘LIBRA’ has been used for different projects), in this context, it appears to be a more recently emerged token, possibly categorized as a meme coin or community token. Why LIBRA? The reasons behind President Milei’s endorsement remain speculative. Is it a genuine belief in the project? A strategic move to appeal to a younger, digitally-native demographic? Or perhaps a broader statement about embracing decentralized finance and challenging traditional financial systems? What are the implications? A presidential endorsement, even through a retweet, can significantly impact public perception and market activity. It lends legitimacy to the project in the eyes of some and can encourage wider adoption, especially within Argentina and potentially beyond. The timeline of events, as reported by Solid Intel, paints a clear picture of Milei’s intriguing crypto maneuver: Initial Tweet (Deleted): President Milei posts a tweet that appears to endorse LIBRA. Tweet Deletion: The initial tweet is deleted, causing confusion and speculation. Retweet Tutorial: Milei retweets a tutorial explaining how to purchase LIBRA, seemingly reaffirming his support. This sequence of actions, from initial endorsement to tutorial sharing, strongly suggests a deliberate and calculated move to bring attention to LIBRA. Millionaire Trader’s Explosive $2.8M Profit: A Case Study in Meme Coin Mania The immediate aftermath of President Milei’s retweet saw a surge of activity around LIBRA, both in terms of social media buzz and trading volume. Lookonchain, another prominent crypto analytics platform, highlighted a particularly striking example of this market reaction. Trader goofyahh.sol, known for their astute crypto moves, made a significant investment in LIBRA following Milei’s endorsement. Here’s a breakdown of the trader’s activity, as reported by Lookonchain: Action Details Initial Investment 5 million USDC spent to purchase 10.4 million LIBRA Current Holding 10.4 million LIBRA Unrealized Profit (at time of report) $2.8 million Previous Profit on LIBRA $1.65 million This data illustrates the potentially explosive gains that can be achieved in the meme coin market, especially when coupled with high-profile endorsements. goofyahh.sol’s $2.8 million unrealized profit, on top of a previous $1.65 million gain, underscores the high-risk, high-reward nature of investing in such volatile assets. It’s a compelling example of how quickly fortunes can be made – and potentially lost – in the meme coin space. Decoding the Crypto Endorsement: What Does it Mean for LIBRA and Argentina? President Milei’s endorsement of LIBRA Crypto raises several important questions about the future of cryptocurrency in Argentina and the broader implications for meme coin legitimacy. Let’s consider some potential angles: Boost for Crypto Adoption in Argentina? Argentina has been grappling with economic instability and high inflation. Cryptocurrencies are often seen as an alternative to traditional financial systems in such environments. Milei’s pro-crypto stance, now explicitly extending to LIBRA Crypto , could signal a government openness to digital assets, potentially fostering greater adoption within the country. Legitimizing Meme Coins? Meme coins, often characterized by their internet-born origins and community-driven nature, have historically been viewed with skepticism by traditional investors. A presidential endorsement, however unconventional, could inject a degree of legitimacy into the meme coin market, attracting a wider range of participants. Volatility and Risk: It’s crucial to remember that meme coins like LIBRA Crypto are inherently volatile. Their price movements can be driven by social media trends, influencer endorsements, and market sentiment, often with little grounding in fundamental value. While the potential for explosive gains is evident, so too is the risk of significant losses. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased attention on LIBRA Crypto , fueled by presidential endorsement and trader profits, could attract regulatory scrutiny. Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies, and meme coins, with their rapid price fluctuations and often opaque origins, may face particular attention. Navigating the Meme Coin Frenzy: Benefits, Challenges, and Actionable Insights The LIBRA saga highlights both the allure and the perils of the meme coin market. For those considering venturing into this space, it’s essential to understand the landscape: Benefits of Investing in Meme Coins like LIBRA: High Potential Returns: As demonstrated by the trader goofyahh.sol’s experience, meme coins can offer the potential for rapid and substantial returns, far exceeding those typically found in traditional markets. Community-Driven Growth: Meme coins often thrive on strong online communities, which can drive organic growth and create a sense of shared ownership among investors. Accessibility: Meme coins are generally easily accessible through decentralized exchanges, making them available to a wide range of investors, regardless of their financial background. Challenges of Investing in Meme Coins like LIBRA: Extreme Volatility: Price swings in meme coins can be dramatic and unpredictable. Investors must be prepared for the possibility of significant losses. Lack of Fundamental Value: Unlike established cryptocurrencies with underlying technology or use cases, meme coin value is often driven purely by hype and speculation. Rug Pull Risks: The meme coin space is susceptible to scams and “rug pulls,” where project creators abandon the project and abscond with investor funds. Due diligence is paramount. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Meme Coin Market: Do Your Research: Before investing in any meme coin, including LIBRA Crypto , thoroughly research the project, its community, and its potential risks. Invest What You Can Afford to Lose: Given the inherent volatility, only invest funds that you can comfortably afford to lose without significant financial impact. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto portfolio and allocate only a small percentage to high-risk meme coins. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market trends, social media sentiment, and any news related to the meme coins you are interested in. Use Caution and Skepticism: Approach meme coin investments with a healthy dose of skepticism and be wary of hype-driven narratives. Conclusion: The Presidential Tweet Heard ‘Round the Crypto World Javier Milei’s crypto endorsement , particularly his retweet regarding LIBRA Crypto , has undeniably injected a fresh wave of excitement and speculation into the digital currency market. Whether it’s a strategic move, a genuine belief, or simply a reflection of his unconventional approach, the impact is undeniable. The tale of trader goofyahh.sol’s multi-million dollar profit serves as a stark reminder of the explosive potential – and inherent risks – within the meme coin ecosystem. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, presidential endorsements, meme coin mania, and the pursuit of astronomical gains will likely remain intertwined, creating a dynamic and often unpredictable market for investors to navigate. The Argentine President’s foray into LIBRA Crypto is a story that is still unfolding, and one that the crypto world will be watching closely.

In the past 24 hours, the total market capitalization of Solana-based meme coins has climbed to $11.5 billion, with top tokens like Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) and Bonk ($BONK) seeing gains of 10.3% and 2.9%, respectively. However, the rapid expansion of Solana’s ecosystem has also led to challenges – network congestion, transaction failures, and scalability issues are increasingly prevalent. With Solana continuing to dominate the meme coin market, the demand for a more efficient Layer-2 solution has never been higher. Solaxy is set to address these problems head-on with its upcoming Layer-2 scaling technology, positioning itself as a key player in the evolution of the Solana network. Currently, the $SOLX presale price sits at $0.001634, offering early participants a potential opportunity to gain exposure before future exchange listings. Solaxy’s Layer-2 Solution Aims to Transform Solana’s Ecosystem Solaxy is being developed as a next-generation Layer-2 scaling solution designed to bolster Solana’s performance while mitigating network congestion. While Solana is celebrated for its high-speed transactions and low fees, its increasing popularity has led to bottlenecks, causing failed transactions and delays. Solaxy’s innovative approach seeks to alleviate these pain points through upcoming off-chain transaction processing and optimized scalability solutions. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1887685176970649636 One of the upcoming innovations in Solaxy’s ecosystem is its off-chain processing model. Instead of executing every transaction on Solana’s Layer-1, Solaxy will process transactions externally before settling them on the mainnet. This method aims to reduce data loads, enabling seamless transaction flow even during high-traffic periods. Additionally, Solaxy’s transaction bundling technology will allow multiple transactions to be aggregated into a single batch, further enhancing efficiency and reducing costs. This feature aims to ensure that users experience minimal delays while keeping transaction fees at a fraction of what they would be on congested networks. Solaxy also plans on introducing its modular infrastructure to allow developers to build optimized dApps tailored to specific use cases. This could be particularly beneficial for high-transaction-volume sectors, such as meme coins, DeFi protocols, and NFT marketplaces. Beyond scalability, Solaxy is working toward cross-chain interoperability, aiming to establish a direct bridge between Solana and Ethereum. This would enable users to seamlessly move assets between the two networks, combining Solana’s speed with Ethereum’s liquidity. Due to the project’s focus on scalability, efficiency, and interoperability, the Solaxy presale continues to attract growing interest from early investors. Crypto Experts Identify Solaxy as a Long-Term Contender The success of Solaxy’s presale has caught the attention of prominent crypto analysts and influencers. Among them is YouTuber ClayBro, who boasts over 136,000 subscribers. ClayBro recently discussed the growing adoption of meme coin projects, emphasizing that despite market fluctuations, interest in promising presales remains strong. In his recent video, ClayBro states the Fear and Greed Index currently stands at 35, indicating a state of fear in the market. As this number rises, it reflects increasing investor confidence and growing market greed. Given that meme coin search volume is at an all-time high, ClayBro believes the index will soon shift, leading to higher trading volumes and driving greater demand for tokens. Solaxy Token Is Being Overlooked! Major Gains Ahead If Solaxy Can Do This One Simple Thing! When this happens, we could see the continuous adoption of new meme coins such as Solaxy. ClayBro also highlights that Solaxy is one of the fastest-growing meme coin presales in the market – second to only Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE), which has raised a massive $70 million so far. With the $WEPE presale running out in just the next few days, the attention may turn to Solaxy shortly after. While volatility is constant, especially among emerging crypto projects, Solaxy’s staking program offers a way for investors to generate passive returns. The current staking APY (annual percentage yield) sits at 200%, making it an attractive incentive for long-term holders. Additionally, over 5.7 billion $SOLX tokens have already been staked, reinforcing the community’s belief in the project’s future. How to Participate in the Solaxy Presale With more than $21 million already raised, Solaxy’s presale is gaining momentum as investors seek exposure to promising Layer-2 solutions. As the presale progresses, the price of $SOLX is expected to increase, providing early adopters with a potential opportunity to secure tokens at current rates. Interested participants can purchase $SOLX through the official Solaxy presale website. The platform supports a variety of payment methods, including Ethereum ($ETH), Tether ($USDT), and Binance Coin ($BNB). Additionally, for added convenience, purchases can be made via Credit Card. Furthermore, $SOLX is also available for purchase through the Best Wallet app , available on both Google Play and the Apple App Store . As Solana’s ecosystem continues to expand, the need for an effective Layer-2 scaling solution has never been more apparent. With its advanced transaction optimization techniques and strong community support, Solaxy is emerging as a key player in the next phase of blockchain evolution.

However, the third largest cryptocurrency is up by more than five percent on the weekly chart. However, the majority of the top 10 coins have drifted into the red zone, with Bitcoin trading below $96,000. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, XRP is following Bitcoin’s price movements, as is typical for many altcoins. With Bitcoin facing a pullback, XRP is also showing signs of weakness and may fail to sustain its recent breakout above the resistance level of $2.58 to $2.73. If XRP closes a daily candle below $2.58, this would be a bearish signal, hinting that the area could flip to resistance once again. However, a higher low above the previous low could still signal a potential positive outlook for XRP. Key Support Levels to Watch The next significant support levels for XRP are between $2.25 and $2.30. If XRP manages to hold above this, it could still maintain a bullish structure. A further pullback could test the $2 support level. Additionally, smaller support zones, like around $2.46 to $2.47, may also provide some relief if previous resistance levels flip to support. Bearish Divergence and Short-Term Outlook Despite the ongoing bearish divergence, which is still active, the price action may be approaching a local low. This could trigger a relief rally in the coming days, especially as the price nears oversold territories on the 2-hour chart. However, XRP may still dip slightly lower before finding support. In the short term, more choppy sideways price action is expected, with the larger bearish divergence potentially continuing until invalidated.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|BTC|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-19 06:16:05

This shows strong investor confidence but also sets the stage for what could be the most significant wallet token launch in the decentralized finance space. With an ambitious plan to secure 40% of the crypto wallet market by 2026, Best Wallet could become a dominant player in the industry, which could make investing in $BEST tokens during the presale worthwhile. $BEST Token Utility The $BEST token is the foundation of the Best Wallet ecosystem. Holding $BEST provides many benefits that enhance the Best Wallet user experience and maximize investment potential. Users holding $BEST enjoy reduced transaction costs across the Best Wallet ecosystem. Best Wallet’s staking aggregator also offers higher APY returns for those holding $BEST tokens. Beyond financial benefits, token holders can participate in governance decisions, influencing the future direction of the ecosystem. While the presale lasts, investors can stake their $BEST tokens to grow their holdings. Currently, the dynamic APY is 161%. However, dynamic yields drop when more tokens are staked, as they share the same emission pool. Crypto Gains, a popular crypto YouTube channel, has shared that this is one of the best token launches this year. He believes investing in $BEST now is like investing in MetaMask if it had a token launch. In other words, this launch could be massive. Best Wallet: Token Presale! It’s Like Investing In Metamask If That Had A Coin! EASY 10X? What makes the $BEST token unique is the exclusive Stage 0 access to new projects before they are available to the general public. For example, Best Wallet users had the opportunity to buy Catslap, a meme coin with gamified slapping mechanics, which launched at a $1 million market cap and peaked at $40 million a few days later. Investors who took the opportunity saw massive returns. Even the $BEST token presale started on the Best Wallet app for the first two weeks before becoming available to everyone else via its presale site. Investors who buy these vetted presales can do so at the earliest stages and claim the tokens post-launch within their wallets regardless of the chain, as Best Wallet is a multi-chain wallet. The $WEPE Claim is Now Live! You can now claim your $WEPE tokens directly in Best Wallet or through the official @WepeToken claim website. https://t.co/Yxin9GiUaN Read the full thread below for all the details! pic.twitter.com/MRWgvBu59E — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) February 17, 2025 A Game-Changer in Crypto Wallets Best Wallet is a multi-chain, non-custodial wallet that allows users to manage multiple cryptocurrencies within a single platform. This makes it convenient while allowing users to control their assets completely. Via the mobile app, users can buy and sell crypto with fiat, swap tokens across supported blockchains, or manage their portfolio in one place. Security and user experience remain top priorities for Best Wallet. By integrating Fireblocks MPC-CMP technology, it becomes the first wallet in the industry to utilize this cutting-edge security feature, which also offers lightning-fast transaction signing. The Best Wallet team plans to launch the Best Card in the future, a crypto debit card that allows users to spend their crypto holdings on real-world transactions. Cashback rewards are planned for every purchase, but most importantly, $BEST token holders will see reduced transaction fees, which is another reason to hold $BEST tokens. Airdrop Success and Social Growth To strengthen its user base, the Best Wallet platform has launched an airdrop campaign that rewards wallet users with $BEST tokens. This is designed to allow even those unable to invest in the presale to still earn and benefit from the ecosystem. Participants in the airdrop campaign can complete daily and weekly quests that encourage engagement with wallet features, such as token swaps, presale purchases, and portfolio management. Engaging with and sharing the content on social media also earns points. Currently, the Best Wallet X account has over 50k followers and has grown massively since this Web3 wallet launched. With successfully raising $10 million so far, strong community backing, and a game-changing approach to crypto wallets, Best Wallet is well on its way to becoming a market leader.
