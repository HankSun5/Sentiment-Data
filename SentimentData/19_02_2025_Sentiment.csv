Here’s the Best Altcoin to Buy and Hold in 2025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-your-portfolio-stuck-heres-the-best-altcoin-to-buy-and-hold-in-2025/,"Investors hunting for explosive growth in the crypto market are turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending platform whose presale is rapidly gaining momentum. Over $665,000 has already been secured in the opening phase of the presale, with more than 1,050 holders claiming stakes at the current price of $0.01 per token. 60% of Phase One tokens sold out within days and the project is demonstrating a level of demand rarely seen in early-stage crypto ventures. For early buyers, this translates to a guaranteed 600% return at launch and a potential 100x surge within two years. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Platform Built for Real-World Use Mutuum Finance (MUTM) addresses a critical need in decentralized finance: accessible, secure lending and borrowing. The platform allows users to either deposit assets into liquidity pools for passive income or borrow funds against their crypto holdings without selling them. Lenders earn variable yields tied to market demand, while borrowers retain ownership of their collateralized assets, a win-win structure attracting both cautious earners and strategic traders. Take Ethereum (ETH) holders, for example. By locking 10 ETH as collateral, they can borrow stablecoins to fund other investments or expenses, all while benefiting if ETH’s value climbs. This flexibility eliminates the need to liquidate positions during market dips, a feature resonating with investors seeking long-term portfolio growth. Driving Demand Through Innovation Beyond its core lending services, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rolling out an overcollateralized stablecoin backed by on-chain reserves. Designed to maintain price stability, this asset will streamline borrowing processes and enhance trust in the ecosystem. As decentralized finance platforms increasingly rely on stablecoins for transactions, Mutuum’s integration positions it to capture a larger share of this booming market. The project further distinguishes itself with a buy-and-distribute mechanism. A percentage of platform fees will automatically purchase MUTM tokens from the open market, redistributing them to stakers. This system creates continuous buying pressure, directly linking platform activity to token value appreciation. Combined with plans to launch a beta version of its platform alongside exchange listings, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is engineering conditions for sustained growth long after its presale concludes. Presale Momentum Builds Rapidly Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has strategically priced its presale to reward early participants. Phase One offers tokens at $0.01. At launch, the token will list at $0.06, locking in a 600% gain for Phase One buyers. With over half of the initial allocation already claimed, the window for securing tokens at this entry point is narrowing quickly. Historical patterns in the crypto market show that projects launching with functional platforms see sharper price increases post-listing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is following this blueprint, ensuring its beta lending platform goes live simultaneously with exchange listings. This operational readiness is critica. It allows immediate user adoption, driving transaction volume and liquidity from day one. To accelerate community growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is allocating $100,000 to a giveaway split among ten participants. The campaign, detailed on the project’s official channels, requires simple social media engagement. Such initiatives not only reward early supporters but also amplify visibility, drawing more investors to the presale before Phase One closes. Crypto analysts are unanimous; tokens with clear utility and built-in demand drivers outperform speculative assets during bull markets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) checks both boxes. Its lending platform solves real problems for DeFi users, while its tokenomics create scarcity through buybacks and staking rewards. Experts point to these factors when forecasting a rise to $1 in 2025, a 100x leap from the current presale price.

The choice of the best altcoin to buy in the U.S. usually involves a very close understanding of the trends in the market, new innovations, and their long-term prospects. For example, according to CoinMarketCap, Solana (SOL) is trading at $191.91 , with a 2.84% decrease in the last 24 hours. Dogecoin (DOGE) stands at $0.251 , down 3.22%, and Ethereum (ETH) trades at $2,627 , dropping by 2.89%. With such fluctuations, investors need to focus on tokens that offer stability, utility, and excellent future promise. Why the Market is Shifting Towards Smarter Investments An altcoin entered the U.S. market with uninterrupted DeFi solutions. The platform adapted to changing regulations, ensuring compliance and user trust at all times. Consequently, its rise indicated the dawn of a new era for decentralized finance. Investors seek platforms offering real-world utilities and adopt projects incorporating AI, automation, and financial tools. One such project making waves is RCO Finance (RCOF) , which is making a strong claim as the best altcoin to buy. Most altcoins use only hype, but RCOF combines AI-powered trading and real-world asset investment with a seamless DeFi experience. Central to its design is its AI-based Robo Advisor, which gives it an edge with intelligent investment insights drafted specifically for each user’s portfolio. In 2021, Squid Game Token (SQUID), inspired by the popular Netflix series, skyrocketed to over $2,800 before crashing to nearly zero in days, leaving investors with significant losses. The Robo Advisor could have flagged early signs, such as large withdrawals and alarming reductions in reserves for stakeholders to exit before the crash, reducing investors’ exposure to risk. RCOF: A Smarter Way to Trade and Invest RCO Finance is changing the entire paradigm of investment strategies by providing access to more than 120,000 assets within 12,500 asset classes, including stocks, bonds, and tokenized real-world assets like real estate, wallets, and commodities. This makes sure that crypto investors diversify away from conventional crypto trading. It also offers automated market-making, providing liquidity while rewarding users on DEXs. This provision entails users’ active participation in the DeFi ecosystem by joining liquidity pools to earn returns. With RCO Finance, up to 1000x leverage is available, allowing maximum returns with little capital across many asset classes. Such high-leverage provision is rare, once again solidifying RCOF’s position as the best altcoin to buy now. The Altcoin Fueling the Future of DeFi Private Syndicate ETF Funds offered by RCO Finance permit investors to consolidate their finance in diversified ETFs across numerous asset classes. Hence, crypto investors can reap the benefits from the constant proven strength of ETFs. Additionally, it uses a non-KYC model, which guarantees privacy and anonymity to users. This ensures that users can access decentralized finance products without going through verification processes. Asset purchases using cryptocurrencies can also be made via this platform, allowing investments in stocks, bonds, and real estate. An audit by SolidProof has been carried out on RCO Finance and is a mark of assurance for smart contracts and risks of exploit minimization. Consequently, investors feel secure that their funds are safe while remaining confident in RCOF. RCO Finance has also launched its Beta platform , where its users can test what the next cutting-edge functionalities would look like. Over 10,000 users have joined to test the ecosystem and give valuable feedback. Seize the Opportunity and Invest in RCO Finance Today Having sold over 13 million tokens, analysts believe the token could launch even higher than the projected $0.6, generating massive returns for early investors. Currently, RCOF is in the presale stage at the price of $0.10, which is expected to go up by 30% to $0.13 in the next stage. This makes it the best altcoin to buy right now, offering a golden opportunity to invest before the price surges! If you invest $1,000 today, you could get $70,000 profit post-listing. Don’t miss this opportunity to become part of the finance revolution. The platform also recently announced a giveaway of $100,000, with early investors able to take part in this massive offer. For those who missed out on early Solana (SOL) or Ethereum (ETH) investments, this is another chance to be a part of something equally, if not more revolutionary.

Web3Bay’s DAO Redefines E-Commerce – Explosive Presale Growth Expected!",https://thecoinrise.com/cast-your-vote-shape-your-market-web3bays-dao-redefines-e-commerce-explosive-presale-growth-expected/,"Today’s e-commerce giants like Amazon and eBay operate under a top-heavy, centralized framework that dictates policies and fees, leaving little room for user input. Enter Web3Bay, a game changer in online shopping that empowers its community through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This pioneering approach hands the reins of control back to the users. A DAO operates on a blockchain framework where decisions are democratically made by token holders, not a central figure. Ownership of Web3Bay ’s 3BAY token provides a ticket to this democratic process, allowing users to vote on key matters such as fee structures, platform updates, seller regulations, and security enhancements. By removing middlemen and enabling community-driven decisions, Web3Bay is creating an open and accountable ecosystem. This shift ensures that the platform evolves according to the needs and wants of its actual users, rather than the financial agendas of distant executives. Web3Bay Presale Success & Market Dynamics Web3Bay’s initial token offering is quickly gaining momentum, reflecting strong market faith in its revolutionary model. As of February 17, 2025, the initiative has amassed over $1.4 million, with more than 360 million tokens distributed at $0.004562625 each. This robust engagement underscores the market’s appetite for decentralized e-commerce solutions. Spanning 28 stages, the presale sees a consistent 15% hike in token price per stage. Now at Stage 4, each 3BAY token stands at $0.004562, anticipated to soar to $0.1959 by launch. This structured price ascent offers early backers substantial potential gains, mirroring the trajectories of previously successful blockchain projects. Unlike typical blockchain marketplaces focused solely on NFT transactions, such as OpenSea and Rarible, Web3Bay integrates DAO into everyday e-commerce. It allows its community to dictate everything from fees to seller standards and conflict resolution, marking a rare but significant stride in the industry and solidifying its competitive edge. Why Web3Bay’s DAO Model Is Transformative for E-Commerce Decentralized governance through DAO offers several transformative advantages for the e-commerce sector: Transparency & Trust : Each decision is immutably recorded on the blockchain, ensuring clarity and fairness in governance, free from manipulation. Community-Driven Rules : The platform adapts through community consensus rather than top-down mandates, reflecting the true needs and preferences of its users. Reduced Costs & Equitable Transactions : By cutting out traditional operational overheads and decentralizing control, Web3Bay minimizes fees and fosters fair trade practices. Enhanced Security with Smart Contracts : Automated escrow systems bolster transaction security, safeguarding against common e-commerce risks such as fraud and counterfeit listings. Web3Bay’s commitment to a DAO-based model resonates with the broader move toward decentralization seen across various sectors. Successful DAOs like Uniswap and MakerDAO have demonstrated the efficacy of governance tokens in balancing user empowerment with operational efficiency. By adopting this governance model, Web3Bay is not just participating in the market—it’s redefining the rules of engagement for the digital marketplace. With a thriving presale and a robust, community-first governance structure, Web3Bay is poised to lead the charge in the new wave of decentralized retail. As blockchain technology becomes more mainstream, the evolution towards user-managed marketplaces seems destined. Web3Bay isn’t merely launching another e-commerce platform; it’s pioneering an era of equitable, transparent, and community-focused shopping.

Nigerian Lawmaker Denies Crypto Ties, Sues for Defamation According to a local news outlet , Agbese is seeking a declaration that Gambaryan’s statements were defamatory, an order preventing him from making further claims, and a public retraction of the allegations. He also demands ₦1 billion in general damages and an additional ₦5 million to cover legal expenses. The controversy stems from social media posts in which Gambaryan accused Agbese and two other legislators of attempting to secure a $150 million bribe through cryptocurrency transactions. The claims quickly gained traction online and were widely reported by Nigerian media outlets, including Channels Television and Blueprint.

The lawsuit asserts that Agbese has never owned a cryptocurrency account or engaged in digital currency transactions. In addition to financial compensation, the lawsuit demands that Gambaryan issue a public apology in at least three national newspapers and remove all social media posts containing the allegations. The suit also seeks a court injunction to prevent further dissemination of the claims. The Nigerian government has also intervened in the matter. On February 14, 2025, the Minister of Information and National Orientation dismissed Gambaryan’s accusations, stating that no credible evidence had been presented to support them.

Binance Exec Tigran Gambaryan Freed After Months in Nigerian Detention Tigran Gambaryan, a Binance executive specializing in financial crime compliance, was arrested in Nigeria in February 2024 on money laundering charges during a business trip. His colleague, Nadeem Anjarwalla, managed to escape to Kenya , but Gambaryan remained detained at Kuje Correctional Center. Binance has consistently denied wrongdoing and called for his release, arguing that he was not a company decision-maker. The exchange also alleged that Nigerian officials requested a secret payment to resolve the issue, a claim the Nigerian government denies .

His detention led to severe health complications, including pneumonia, malaria, and a herniated disk that left him reliant on crutches. Despite medical reports recommending surgery, his requests for medical attention were repeatedly denied . The court ordered Gambaryan to pay a $2,000 fine for overstaying his visa before returning to the U.S . Despite all these legal attacks, Binance continues to dispute these allegations and is engaging with Nigerian officials to resolve the matter. Looking forward, the court has ordered Gambaryan to respond to its new lawsuit within eight days. Notices will be served through Nigerian media or his legal team. If he fails to respond, the court may proceed in his absence. Crypto, Politics, and Defamation: A Nigerian Court Showdown The legal clash between Nigerian lawmaker Philip Agbese and Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan highlights tensions between politics and the crypto industry. Agbese has filed a ₦1 billion defamation suit, asserting that false claims of a bribery attempt have harmed his public image. Meanwhile, Gambaryan—previously cleared of money laundering charges—now faces another court challenge. This dispute reflects Nigeria’s struggle to regulate cryptocurrencies while balancing innovation and accountability. As the proceedings continue, the ruling may not only settle a personal dispute but also redefine accountability for both public figures and crypto companies, setting a precedent for how weighty online claims are addressed in a digital society.

It is experiencing a tolerable 2% weekly loss as cautious traders reduce yields, volatility, and market turnovers to new lows. During the K33 report launch , the head of research, Vetle Lunde, indicated that the pro-crypto administration headed by President Trump had a long-term positive effect on Bitcoin and the entire industry. However, there is a short-term uncertainty that makes the market lethargic. Lunde said in a report on Tuesday: Bitcoin metrics are softening across all corners of the market. Volumes, yields, options premiums, and ETF flows have moved to areas not seen since before the election. Alongside these lethargic conditions, volatilities have plunged to multi-month lows. Vetle Lunde While comparing Bitcoin’s volatility to the top 100 U.S. companies, Lunde said that 37% of the firms currently show higher 30-day volatility than Bitcoin. Such crazy levels were last seen in October 2023. He further pointed out that periods of low volatility are temporary and rarely last longer; therefore, traders must be ready for a sudden shift. Low premiums are indications of weaker market performance The research further indicated that CME Bitcoin Futures shows premiums have recently dropped past 5%, a rare occurrence. The data from 2021 to 2025 shows that low premiums always coincide with weaker market performance. In futures trading, the basis refers to the difference between an asset’s futures and spot prices. A premium occurs when futures prices exceed spot prices, often signaling bullish sentiment, while a discount suggests bearish conditions. Lunde insists that Bitcoin always performs better in a strong basis regime and asks traders to be cautious during the current market uncertainty. The short-term time frame shows that the $BTC price continues to roll over after breaking through the top of the descending wedge. If this downtrend continues, the next horizontal support is $94,000, and the bottom range is $92,000. Just below this is the major ascending trendline that stretches back to the 2021 bull market. Bitcoin price remains uncertain, but the potential of an uptrend is still intact on the week A keen look at the weekly $BTC chart reveals how the prices have gone sideways over extended periods in the current bull market. The position is very healthy and will probably lead to a higher top than if the price keeps climbing. Looking at this chart, the bear might say that an M-top chart pattern may be playing out. Of course, this is always a possibility. However, the trend is still upward until the price falls and confirms below the current range, the bottom of which is bolstered by the ascending trendline. At the foot of the chart, the Stochastic RSI, which highlights price strength, has its indicators hitting the lowest point. If they turn back and climb over the 20.00 level, the renewed upward price force can push $BTC from its current range to the next new level. This will likely begin taking place in less than a month.

Macro Set-Up For Bitcoin And Ethereum Surge While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana face a downtrend due to rising volatility, Pal remains steadfast in his optimistic projection, believing that the market is in the greatest macro target of all time. The Real Vision CEO shared a series of thread posts on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting technical indicators and macro factors that would positively influence Bitcoin and Ethereum’s price trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forms Double Bottom After Crash, Is A Bounce To $112,000 ATH Possible? Sharing a logarithmic weekly chart of Bitcoin, Pal indicated that Bitcoin had experienced a long-term price uptrend line since 2020, showing a distinct pattern of higher lows. Currently, Bitcoin is moving within a tight trading range, which Pal believes could be bullish, as a strong break above the resistance line could trigger a major run. Similarly, the Real Vision Co-founder presented a price chart of Ethereum, highlighting that ETH is currently consolidated within a symmetrical triangle, signaling the potential for a price breakout. Typically, a symmetrical triangle pattern is seen as a bullish signal for ETH, but considering its recent underperformance compared to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana, a strong bullish breakout remains skeptical. Looking at the symmetrical triangle, a breakout from the upper trendline could see the Ethereum price skyrocketing to $4,000 or even higher based on Pal’s chart. Additionally, the Solana price, which has been seeing varying momentum lately, has tested a key horizontal resistance multiple times, forming a strong accumulation base. Historically such consolidation phases tend to precede explosive rallies, provided that broader market trends remain favorable. In his post, Pal encourages traders to “zoom out” , likely suggesting a shift from short-term fluctuations to long term cycles. He warned against excessive leverage and risk-taking to avoid liquidation in volatile conditions. He also urges traders to remain patient, watching how the market unfolds and preparing ahead of a potential bullish surge. Market Volatility Raises Fear In his analysis, Pal suggested that the broader crypto market is currently plagued by fear and panic, as volatility rises and crypto prices experience a downtrend. He explains that a significant portion of crypto investors or traders are currently bearish.

Due to this market change, many in the market had sold off their tokens to avoid further losses. Despite this bearish trend, Pal maintains an optimistic outlook, expecting a strong surge for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.

Tether co-founder Reeve Collins is now the chairman and co-founder of Pi Protocol, the maker of a new USDT competitor, USP, Bloomberg reports . The Pi stablecoin is scheduled to roll out on the Solana ( SOL ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchains later this year. Pi aims to use smart contracts to execute transactions and mint the USP stablecoin, which aims to be backed by bonds and other yield-bearing real-world assets. The project aims to be more decentralized than other stablecoin projects, such as Tether’s USDT, giving users a larger piece of the pie, according to the report. Says Collins on the new stablecoin, “I very much supported Tether over the years, it’s an extraordinary invention that we’ve developed… We view Pi Protocol as the evolution of stablecoins. Tether has been extremely successful in showcasing demand for stablecoins. But they keep all the yield. We believe 10 years later the market is really ready to evolve.” Says Pi CEO Bundeep Singh Rangar of the new crypto project, “You want assets that are non-correlated to crypto that are mid- to high yield, low risk. We have a mechanism that assesses the quality of the asset. They are ones that are vetted on their loss ratio and origination of where they are coming from.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Catzilla, a rising Solana-based meme coin, is making waves and positioning itself as a potential challenger to Litecoin and Polkadot. Table of Contents Catzilla: The monstrous meme coin Why Catzilla could be the next crypto heavyweight Conclusion The crypto market is buzzing with a potential new star on the horizon. Catzilla, a promising Solana-based project, is gaining attention for its growth potential. With the current bull run in full swing, enthusiasts are speculating whether this newcomer can challenge established giants like Litecoin (LTC) and Polkadot (DOT). Catzilla: The monstrous meme coin In the ever-chaotic meme coin battleground, Catzilla emerges as a behemoth ready to demolish the status quo. Unlike the usual dog-themed tokens that flood the market, Catzilla introduces an entirely new narrative — an unstoppable kaiju-cat storming through the crypto scene with fiery ambition. Inspired by the legendary appeal of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe, this token blends meme culture with real financial opportunity. What sets Catzilla apart isn’t just its name — it’s the movement it represents. This Solana-based sensation fuses anime aesthetics, gaming mechanics, and a decentralized vision to create a new kind of meme token experience. With a rebellious edge and a commitment to financial freedom, Catzilla is uniting crypto enthusiasts, gamers, and meme lovers in a battle against outdated financial systems. Why Catzilla stands out: Massive ROI potential: Catzilla’s presale features 14 stages, allowing early investors to capitalize on a rise from $0.0002 to $0.0016 — a massive 700% increase before its official launch. Game-changing narrative: While most meme coins focus solely on hype, Catzilla weaves an immersive kaiju-inspired storyline, giving the community a reason to rally beyond mere speculation. Triple utility model: Catzilla isn’t just a meme — it offers value through gameplay integration, a powerful community movement, and a fun yet lucrative crypto ecosystem. More than just another meme coin, Catzilla is here to redefine what it means to be a digital asset in the modern market.

The project offers a hybrid model that taps into multiple lucrative crypto sectors. Its threefold strategy — combining meme-driven virality, interactive gaming elements, and a decentralized mission — positions it as a force to be reckoned with. More than a payment coin: Litecoin’s appeal lies in its efficiency for transactions. Catzilla expands beyond payments by integrating gaming incentives and DeFi opportunities. Beyond interoperability: Polkadot enhances blockchain connectivity. On the other hand, Catzilla fosters community engagement and reward-driven ecosystems. Massive growth potential: With a presale offering up to 700% ROI, Catzilla’s early-stage opportunity challenges the stagnation seen in older altcoins. By embracing innovation while staying true to the playful spirit of meme coins, Catzilla isn’t just entering the arena — it’s redefining it. As the crypto market shifts towards high-engagement assets, Catzilla has the potential to outpace traditional altcoins and cement itself as a leader in the next wave of blockchain growth. Conclusion While Litecoin and Polkadot show less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as a meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom. Offering a 700% ROI during its presale — from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages — Catzilla’s triple utility empowers holders and unites them to join the fight against crypto villains.

The newly acquired licenses will allow LTP HK to deal in securities and futures contracts, advise on securities and futures contracts, and manage assets. LTP HK became the first prime brokerage focused on virtual assets to secure a comprehensive suite of HK SFC licenses. LTP announced today that its subsidiary LTP HK had secured types 1, 2, 4, 5, and 9 licenses from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (HK SFC). LTP HK became the first prime brokerage to deal in securities and futures contracts, advise on securities and futures contracts, and manage assets. LTP disclosed that LTP HK was now licensed to offer a range of financial services to institutional clients, including proprietary trading firms, hedge funds, asset managers, and corporate investors. According to LTP, the regulatory achievement solidified LTP HK’s credibility and leadership within the dynamic financial services landscape. Jack Young, the founder and CEO of LTP, said regulatory compliance was the ‘fundamental pillar’ of the firm’s institutional prime brokerage services. He added that LTP was committed to serving institutional clients who demanded secure high-performance trading infrastructure. LTP HK increases its financial service offerings with new HK SFC licenses LTP announced that its Hong Kong subsidiary, LTP HK, had gained approval for a type 1 HK SFC license, which allowed the company to deal in securities. LTP HK also received type 2 licensing, allowing it to deal in futures contracts. Types 4 and 5 licenses authorized LTP HK to advise on securities and futures contracts, respectively. The type 9 SFC license allowed LTP HK to engage in regulated asset management. HK SFC recently announced its swift licensing process and revamped the second phase of its assessment of virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs). The agency disclosed that its proactive engagement and enhanced communication with VATPs to provide direct and effective guidance on its expected regulatory standards were key to the swift licensing process. LTP stated that the LTP HK’s approvals from the HK SFC aligned with the company’s commitment to regulatory compliance, institutional-grade services offering, and investor protection. “This regulatory milestone marks a strategic leap forward in our mission to bridge traditional finance with digital asset innovation.” -Ethan Wang, CEO of LiquidityTech Limited (LTP HK) Wang added that LTP HK was set to empower institutions with compliant customer-protected solutions that drove growth in evolving markets as Hong Kong cemented ‘its role as a global hub for financial innovation.’ The HK SFC had earlier identified various deficiencies and substandard conduct during the course of its supervision of licensed corporations engaged in asset management. Hong Kong SFC streamlines licenses for virtual asset managers The HK SFC recently published a circular detailing a new streamlined licensing process that now applies to all new applicants for a virtual asset trading platform (VATP) license. The single external assessment conducted after the applicant had implemented all its internal systems and controls replaced the two-phased external assessment previously required. Previously, applicants for virtual asset trading platform licenses–under the HK SFC’s Scope of External Assessment Reports published in June 2023–were required to engage an external assessor to submit two assessment reports to the SFC. The phase 1 report was submitted with the license application, and the effectiveness of the design of the license applicant’s proposed policies was assessed. The phase 2 report was submitted by an external assessor after the SFC granted approval-in-principle of the virtual asset trading platform license application and assessed the effectiveness of the policies, procedures, and the systems and controls actually implemented. External assessors are required to submit only one assessment report under the new streamlined licensing process. HK SFC confirmed that assessment was required to ensure that a VATP applicant’s systems and controls, policies, and procedures were suitably designed and implemented to meet the requirements of the SFC’s VATP and AML/CFT guidelines. The circular contained no details of the required terms of reference, scope, and specific areas to be covered by the single assessment report. According to the HK SFC, these details were available in the now defunct Scope of External Assessment Reports.",Press Release,EN,0,0,ASIA|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-18 23:04:00

40517288,https://coingape.com/?p=239683,1739920676,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Bitwise Donates To Open Source Bitcoin Development Amid Market Downturn,https://coingape.com/bitwise-donates-to-open-source-bitcoin-development/,"Asset management firm Bitwise has unveiled a new donation to support open-source innovation of the Bitcoin network. According to the firm’s update, this latest donation aligns with its promise to give back after its Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ($BITB) launch in January 2024. Bitwise Aim to Boost Bitcoin Development At the time, Bitwise hinted at its plan to give 10% of its gross profits each year to charity. In a recent development, the asset manager announced the donation, saying it is finally fulfilling its promise to the public. Bitwise revealed on X that it will donate $150,000 to support Bitcoin’s open-source developers. The fund is designed to encourage developers who work tirelessly to secure and maintain the Bitcoin network. This is the first annual donation since the promise was made. Bitwise intends to allocate the funds to three non-profit organizations: Bitcoin Brink, Open Sats, and the Human Rights Foundation (HRF). It believes these entities already have established track records within the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. “Thank you to the investors who’ve chosen Bitwise and BITB among many options. This donation is made possible because of your choice. We hope you’re as proud as we are to support Bitcoin open-source developers,” Bitwise wrote on X. The Donation Rationale Significantly, this donation may trigger increased participation from developers as it promotes innovation and ensures the security of blockchain technology. Markedly, these open-source developers are crucial to the health status of the Bitcoin blockchain and, by extension, the broader crypto sector. The asset manager believes a donation of $150,000 could attract more talent into the ecosystem. Moreover, this funding positions Bitwise as a firm with futuristic goals and community links. This donation could also attract goodwill to the Bitcoin ETF issuer. Just like it does for Bitcoin, Bitwise also has staking pools, which is its way of supporting the Ethereum ecosystem, which also has ETF ties. The Bitwise Donation Timing Bitwise’s move coincides with the season in which the crypto sector is receiving more favorable policies. Several firms are submitting applications to list multiple crypto ETFs. They are encouraged by the improved trajectory of the crypto sector under President Donald Trump. Even Bitwise filed to list spot XRP ETF weeks ago. The US SEC has acknowledged this XRP ETF filing , officially kickstarting the countdown for the approval The Commission had earlier acknowledged a similar filing from 21Shares a week ago. Through the crypto task force , many are positive the filing will gain approval amid broad rules review.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Solana stalls, attention is shifting to Rollblock for its massive growth potential. Table of Contents Rollblock poised for 100x rally Is Solana facing another correction? Conclusion As the crypto market shifts between uncertainty and opportunity, investors are eagerly searching for the next 100x contender. While Solana (SOL) struggles to reclaim its January highs, a rising star is capturing market attention. Rollblock’s GameFi ecosystem, security, and staking model have helped it raise over $10 million in record time. Rollblock poised for 100x rally Rollblock is emerging as a power player in the $500 billion online casino market. Boasting more than 7,000 AI-powered games and a rapidly growing sports prediction league, Rollblock has already witnessed a 600% uptick in new registrations. As the project continues to dominate the altcoin market during its presale, analysts are projecting returns of up to 880% for early RBLK adopters. Unlike traditional gaming platforms, Rollblock incorporates both traditional and digital finance. Players can top up their accounts using 20+ compatible cryptocurrencies by connecting their wallets or deposit fiat currency via Google Pay, Apple Pay, or MasterCard. Rollblock is also committed to user security through its Ethereum-backed security system. All wagers are automatically encrypted on-chain, making it impossible to alter bets after they are placed. Rollblock’s smart contract has passed a SolidProof audit, ensuring that there are no secret back doors for hackers to exploit. You might also like: Coinbase files papers to list SOL; experts notice whales’ continued support for Rollblock Rollblock further sets itself apart from the competition with its native RBLK token. Investors can secure rewards of up to 30% APYs by adding RBLK to staking pools. With the revenue-sharing model, Rollblock will use up to 30% of its weekly revenue to make open market buybacks of RBLK and distribute 40% of these to holders as rewards. The remaining 60% will be permanently removed from RBLK’s supply, creating scarcity and putting deflationary pressure on the price. Currently, RBLK is in stage 10 of its presale with tokens selling for $0.055. Since Rollblock’s supply is capped at one billion tokens, analysts expect a massive 100x accumulation rally once RBLK is listed on major exchange platforms. Is Solana facing another correction? Solana’s price has remained volatile throughout 2025 after it reached an all-time high of $294 on January 19. Following the rally, a huge meme coin selloff pushed its price below $200. Although Solana’s price action paints a bearish picture, SOL’s Open Interest has surged to $3.3 billion. This recent spike suggests that increased capital is entering Solana’s contracts, potentially setting the stage for a recovery. Another optimistic metric is Solana’s Sharpe ratio which has recently increased to 0.48, suggesting that returns outweigh the associated risk at current prices. Solana is currently selling at $1678.35 following an intraday decline of 5.90%. The altcoin is still trading below several of its Exponential Moving Averages on the daily chart. With the MACD in a bearish crossover, analysts expect more volatility for Solana in the coming weeks.

After a slow initial rollout approximately four months ago, Bloomberg reports that the platform has sold over 24 billion of its WLFI tokens, representing more than 96% of its total supply. As it stands, fewer than 1 billion tokens remain available for sale. World Liberty Financial Token Sale Sparks Debate The World Liberty Financial token, priced at 5 cents each, is part of a broader initiative aimed at raising $300 million at a $1.5 billion valuation. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Faces Renewed Pressure—Is a Breakdown Imminent? The project launched its token sale in mid-October, with the intention of enabling token holders to propose changes to the platform and vote on others’ proposals. However, the limited rights associated with the WLFI tokens have raised concerns. Holders possess minimal voting rights and no economic entitlements, and the tokens cannot be traded or sold back to World Liberty, prompting questions about their long-term value and utility. Adding to the intrigue surrounding World Liberty Financial, crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun, founder of the TRON blockchain, recently disclosed a substantial investment of $45 million into the venture. This increased Justin Sun’s total stake in World Liberty Financial to $75 million, indicating strong confidence in the platform’s potential. TRUMP And MELANIA Tokens Experience Wild Price Fluctuations Analysts are speculating that forthcoming executive orders from Trump could positively influence the cryptocurrency landscape in the US, yet skepticism remains among industry veterans. Nic Carter, a venture capitalist, expressed concerns regarding the ethical implications of a sitting president engaging in business ventures that may present conflicts of interest. The launch of Trump’s memecoins has also stirred significant controversy. As previously reported by NewsBTC, the Donald Trump memecoin (TRUMP) saw a sharp decline, dropping from a weekend high of $75 to $17. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Bulls in Action—Is a New Upside Run Beginning? Similarly, the Melania Trump memecoin (MELANIA) disrupted the market with increased excitement among crypto investors, with its value fluctuating dramatically from a high of $13.64 to its current trading price of $1.26. Bernstein analysts have characterized this period as a “chaotic crypto era,” suggesting that government involvement with cryptocurrencies could redefine the relationship between leadership and emerging technologies. They argue that the launches of Trump and Melania’s memecoins could signal a potential regulatory shift, positioning digital assets as a direct link to a wider audience. While trading at $17, TRUMP is posting significant losses of 6%, 2% and 70% in the 24 hour, fourteen day and monthly time frames respectively, coupled with a 27% drop in trading volume, according to CoinGecko data.

The company announced on Tuesday that it is raising $2 billion in 0% convertible senior notes to buy more Bitcoin, betting even bigger on the long-term value of its holdings. The debt offering, open only to qualified institutional buyers, includes an option to raise an extra $300 million if demand is high. The notes mature in 2030, won’t pay interest, and won’t increase in value over time, according to Strategy’s announcement. Investors can convert them into cash or shares of Strategy’s stock, depending on what the company decides. The notes are redeemable starting in 2027, but only if Strategy’s stock price surpasses 130% of the conversion price for a set period. If that happens, Strategy can buy back the notes at face value plus any special interest owed, per the announcement . If Strategy faces a fundamental change, such as a major acquisition or restructuring, investors can demand repayment on March 1, 2028. The conversion rate and final terms will be determined at pricing, based on Strategy’s stock performance on the day the deal is finalized. Bitcoin acquisition and debt strategy Strategy has been using debt to buy Bitcoin for years, and this latest one actually follows a pattern: raise cash, buy Bitcoin, and wait for the price to rise. The company plans to use the $2 billion for general corporate expenses, but its real focus is accumulating more Bitcoin. In 2024, Strategy bought 258,320 BTC for $22.07 billion, paying an average of $85,447 per Bitcoin, including fees. The company didn’t sell a single Bitcoin, despite price fluctuations. As of December 31, 2024, Strategy held 447,470 BTC, valued at $23.9 billion. But its outstanding debt hit $7.27 billion, with $35.1 million in annual interest costs. The company posted a net loss for 2024, mostly due to $1.79 billion in Bitcoin impairment losses. If Bitcoin’s market price crashes, Strategy’s ability to meet financial obligations could be at risk. The company warned in a 10-K SEC filing that it “may not be able to regain profitability” if Bitcoin’s fair value continues to drop. Strategy has been dealing with old accounting rules that force companies to write down Bitcoin losses, but never adjust gains unless sold. That changes in January 2025 with new FASB fair-value accounting rules. Gains and losses will now be recorded in net income each quarter, creating massive fluctuations in reported profits. The new rules will immediately apply a $12.75 billion adjustment to Strategy’s retained earnings. But there’s a catch: tax liabilities could surge. The company warned that unrealized Bitcoin gains might trigger the 15% Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. “If we become subject to the CAMT, it could result in a material tax obligation that we would need to satisfy in cash,” Strategy said. The tax applies to companies with over $1 billion in annual adjusted financial income, and unless the law is amended, Strategy could owe huge taxes by 2026. The company also faces tax risks across multiple jurisdictions, with uncertainty around deferred tax assets and liabilities, as selling Bitcoin at higher prices than its cost basis will likely trigger some serious capital gains taxes. Strategy’s debt offering is private—only qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A can participate. The notes won’t be registered with the SEC and can’t be publicly sold without an exemption. Investors interested in the deal must attend a live webinar on February 19, 2025, where the company will go over terms, risks, and expectations. “Access to the Video Webinar and completion of the investor survey does not mean you will receive an allocation in this proposed convertible notes offering,” Strategy clarified today.

40517875,https://crypto.news/?p=14337994,1739921820,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/40517875.jpeg,Google to let users access their Bitcoin wallets via Google accounts,https://crypto.news/google-to-let-users-access-their-bitcoin-wallets-via-google-accounts/,"On Feb. 18, 2025, during Hong Kong Bitcoin Tech Carnival, Google web3 specialist Kyle Song revealed that Google is working to simplify the use of Bitcoin for Google users. According to Song, Google is “exploring ways to lower entry barriers so Web2 users can easily use Bitcoin.” Song said the company has been working on the integration of Bitcoin into its ecosystem for about a year since Bitcoin ETFs were approved by the SEC. Table of Contents Details revealed by Song Is this a huge news? The Bitcoin ETFs’ role Details revealed by Song Judging from what Song said, Google is preparing a really simple in-use solution that will seamlessly integrate cryptocurrencies into the Google ecosystem used by billions of people across the world. He said Bitcoin wallets will be embedded into the web2 interface so that users will be able to log into their BTC wallets using Google accounts. As for crypto payments, Google aims to make them as simple and intuitive as already existing web2 payment solutions. Another focus of the Google team is ensuring the security of their solution. They strive “to address trust issues between on-chain and off-chain systems.” To maintain stable, trustless functioning, Google is going to deploy Zero-Knowledge Proofs or similar encryption technologies. Is this a huge news? Although Song’s speech wasn’t a full-fledged announcement but rather a teaser, the project itself, if it plays out well, can propel Bitcoin’s adoption like nothing before did. Google is used by billions of users, many of whom have Google accounts. The way people perceive Bitcoin and crypto may change drastically if, one day, all of these people find out they have a seamless service within their Google account that allows them to purchase, exchange, or spend Bitcoin. If Bitcoin functionality is integrated with Google Pay, crypto may see an immense circulation boom. As people discover they have an easy and secure way to use crypto legally, they may start to explore new opportunities associated with this new class of assets. However, it’s important to keep in mind that sometimes ambitious plans set by top-tier companies fail, and it’s early to judge whether we are going to see this collaboration between Google and Bitcoin materialize or not. In 2020, two tech giants, Facebook and Telegram, had to withdraw their plans to deploy cryptocurrencies integrated into their services when it seemed that the projects were about to take off. Both companies survived and moved on. Eventually, Telegram started to support third-party crypto wallets in the form of mini-apps and bots. The wallets integrated into the messenger saw substantial traction, however, the service has its limitations and concerns while lacking serious promotion from Telegram itself. Will Google succeed in becoming the first high-profile company to implement crypto in its services seamlessly? The chances are higher as 2025 is way different than 2020, a year when Facebook and Telegram were about to launch their ambitious projects. Facebook Libra and Telegram Gram token projects didn’t come to fruition partly because they were set to launch in 2020 when the political and legislative environment was much more unfriendly towards crypto than now. More than that, crypto ETFs were not a thing in those days, making it even harder to bring crypto into web2 service. According to Gemini Exchange co-founder Cameron Winklevoss, the Facebook Libra killing was a politically motivated act . The Biden era was marked with Operation Choke Point 2.0, which denied banking services to various companies working with cryptocurrency, and the shutdown of Facebook Libra perfectly set the tone for the following years under Biden’s leadership and the Gensler-led SEC.

Ironically, it was Gensler who made it possible when he approved Bitcoin ETFs. The Bitcoin ETFs’ role Bitcoin ETF approval is widely viewed as a bridge connecting the crypto market and traditional investors. Bitcoin ETFs align with a clear legal framework while allowing its holders to benefit from the Bitcoin market value. ETFs helped big corporations to enter the crypto sector without having to deal with regulatory uncertainty. The fact that BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF IBIT became the fastest-growing asset in history proves that it’s approval was a transformational move.

The company recently submitted a proposal to acquire the remaining shares of Adecoagro, a major agribusiness and energy company. Tether Offers to Buy More Shares Tether is offering $12.41 per share, which, if approved, would increase its stake from 19.4% to 51%. This would make Tether the company’s majority owner, giving it control over its operations. This move further solidifies the stablecoin issuer’s expansion strategy beyond digital assets. Last September, the stablecoin issuer acquired a 9.8% stake in Adecoagro , which currently owns 19.4% of the agricultural company. On February 14, Tether offered $12.41 per share to buy the rest. If accepted, this would make Tether the majority owner. Adecoagro’s Board of Directors is carefully reviewing the proposal. On February 16, they brought in legal and financial experts to study the deal’s impact. After a full evaluation, a final decision will be made. Adecoagro’s Role in South American Agriculture and Energy Adecoagro is a major player in South America’s agricultural sector, managing over 210,400 hectares of farmland. The company produces more than 2.8 million tons of agricultural goods, including crops and dairy products. Additionally, it operates several industrial facilities and generates over 1 million megawatt-hours of renewable electricity annually. Thus, Adecoagro is a key food producer and an important contributor to the region’s energy sector. Tether’s interest in non-crypto industries is growing. If this deal goes through, it will give the stablecoin company control over a major agricultural and energy business in South America. This aligns with Tether’s broader strategy of diversifying its investments beyond digital assets. Tether’s Expanding Influence Beyond Stablecoins Tether is no longer just a stablecoin company. In the past year, it has invested in Bitcoin mining , artificial intelligence (AI), and even a football club. With this move into agribusiness, Tether is expanding its reach even further. At the same time, Tether’s flagship product, USDT, remains the largest in the market, with a value of over $140 billion. The company is also working with the government of Guinea to help the country with digital transformation, including using blockchain to support economic growth and innovation. A key part of this project is education. Tether is helping set up digital literacy programs in Guinea, teaching people about blockchain technology. The company also contributes to Guinea’s Innovation City project, which supports research and entrepreneurship.

BNB is currently priced at $646.51, reflecting a 0.33% increase over the past seven days. Despite a market cap decline of 3.26%, it still holds a strong valuation of $92.11 billion, with a 1.49% increase in 24-hour trading volume to $1.97 billion. Binance Coin’s long-term performance remains impressive, considering the staggering increase of over 672,878.62% from its all-time low of $0.09611 in January 2017.

The XRP price fall has raised concerns after Donald Trump’s revised tariff policies caused uncertainty, pushing the asset down 2.36%. Meanwhile, Dogecoin price resistance at $0.2655 continues to hinder its rebound despite multiple breakout attempts. However, BlockDAG (BDAG) is drawing significant attention as its 350% bonus offer nears its end. With $196 million already raised in its presale, BDAG’s price rises with every batch. The upcoming mainnet launch and predictions of a $1 price post-launch have made this bonus an opportunity for buyers aiming to multiply their holdings before BDAG’s next big move. XRP Price Falls as Markets React to New Trade Policies The XRP price fall has worsened after former U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest tariff announcements shook the financial markets. XRP dropped 2.36% in the past 24 hours to $2.43 as traders responded to the 25% tariff on steel imports and additional aluminum levies. The change in trade policies created a risk-off environment, leading market participants to exit speculative assets, including cryptocurrencies. Analysts are watching XRP closely, with $2.25 identified as a critical support level. Should the selling pressure persist, the XRP price fall could intensify, potentially driving it down to $2.00 and adding more market uncertainty. Dogecoin Price Resistance at $0.2655 Blocks Further Gains Dogecoin price resistance remains a key obstacle as the asset tries to recover above $0.250. After briefly dipping to $0.2388, DOGE regained some strength, climbing above a bearish trend line and surpassing the 100-hourly simple moving average. Despite this, strong resistance at $0.260 and $0.2655 is holding back its progress. If DOGE breaks through these levels, it could aim for $0.2725 and possibly reach $0.300 in the near term. However, failing to overcome the Dogecoin price resistance could result in a drop toward $0.2520 or even $0.2380, keeping traders cautious. BlockDAG’s 350% Bonus Ends Soon—A Limited Window to Expand Holdings BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700 bonus is in its last phase, giving buyers a limited-time chance to secure a 350% BDAG bonus before prices climb higher. For instance, a $5,000 purchase now delivers an extra $17,500 worth of BDAG, offering a rare chance to grow holdings instantly. With each presale batch increasing the price, this timing has become crucial. The presale has already raised $196 million, selling over 18.5 billion BDAG coins, showing strong market confidence. Since its launch, BDAG’s price has surged 2380% from $0.001 to $0.0248, making it one of the fastest-growing projects in the market. Each presale round is selling out faster than the previous one, and BDAG is expected to hit its $600 million target soon. Analysts consider BDAG one of the top crypto picks, with early buyers positioning for potentially significant long-term returns. BDAG’s real turning point will be its 2025 mainnet launch. Once live, the network’s utility will expand, driving up demand and strengthening its long-term prospects. Analysts are already predicting a $1 price for BDAG post-launch, highlighting the strong growth potential. As the ecosystem grows, BDAG’s value becomes clearer, and early accumulation is likely to pay off well. The project’s path toward wider adoption makes it one of the top crypto picks, with a promising future once the blockchain is fully operational. Final Say! As market dynamics shift, each of these assets faces a pivotal phase. XRP price fall remains a concern as new trade policies increase volatility, prompting traders to monitor key support levels. Dogecoin price resistance at $0.2655 continues to block its recovery, with a breakout being crucial for further gains. On the other hand, BlockDAG stands out as its 350% bonus offer is nearing its final stage. With $196 million raised and a 2380% price surge since batch 1, BDAG’s momentum is undeniable. A 2025 mainnet launch and a $1 price prediction put it among the top crypto picks of today.

In contrast, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is emerging as a game-changer, offering a smarter, AI-driven alternative with real utility. Analysts predict a 400% surge in the next three days, making it one of the most promising investment opportunities in the market. While the Shiba Inu price continues to battle whale sell-outs, WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents a more stable and profitable path, thanks to its ongoing presale, where tokens are currently priced at $0.0420 . With a price increase imminent and its official launch approaching, this project is positioned to outshine the Shiba Inu price, offering investors the chance to capitalize on its early-stage growth before it takes off. Whale Movements Continue To Squeeze Shiba Inu Price Currently priced at $0.000016, the Shiba Inu price has managed a slight recovery after massive whale transfers, climbing 1.3% in the last 24 hours and 3.4% over the past week. However, a closer look at the Shiba Inu price’s 30-day performance, which dropped 23.8%, paints a different picture. These fluctuations happen because whales accumulate when the Shiba Inu price is low and dump their holdings at higher levels, leaving retail investors to bear the brunt of the impact. As these investors seek more stable investments without whales’ influence, a new player is capturing their attention: WallitIQ (WLTQ). This project offers an alternative that combines AI-driven crypto management, near-zero transaction fees , and lucrative staking rewards (up to 180% APY ). Unlike the Shiba Inu price, which relies heavily on meme culture and community speculation, this altcoin positions itself as a utility-based token with tangible benefits. Here’s Why Analysts Say WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Surge By 400% In Three Days While the Shiba Inu price remains in a loop due to whale activities, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is gaining massive traction. Its presale is selling out rapidly as investors rush to secure their tokens at $0.0420 . The next presale stage will increase the price to $0.0620, and top exchange listings are on the way. Based on these developments, this project could see a 400% surge in value in the next few days. Beyond its booming presale , WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) well-structured tokenomics and real-world use cases give it a competitive edge over traditional cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu. With 45% of its supply allocated to public sales, 20% reserved for referral, airdrops and other community bonuses , and 15% dedicated to exchange liquidity, the project is designed for sustainable long-term growth. Unlike speculative meme coins, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is designed for utility-driven adoption. It allows users to pay for their everyday goods using crypto. Through its MVP build, this platform offers users access to AI-powered market insights and several sophisticated trading tools for smarter trading decisions, equipping them with all they need to maximize their profit potential. While the cryptocurrency space remains vulnerable to hacks and malicious smart contracts, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has undergone extensive audits by SolidProof, guaranteeing its reliability and integrity. With other security features such as biometric authentication, AI-driven anomaly detection, and AES & ECC encryption protocols, it further solidifies its reputation as a safe investment. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) platform empowers both retail and whale investors to take advantage of the volatile market. With exchange listings imminent, the WLTQ token price is expected to surpass its presale valuation. Analysts believe that once the upcoming beta platform goes live and early adopters begin testing the platform’s advanced features, demand will skyrocket, fueling a price rally of up to 400% within three days. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale Closing Soon: Last Chance Before The 400% Surge While Shiba Inu price continues to experience unpredictable price swings due to whale activity, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is proving to be a far more strategic investment. Its AI-powered wallet, low fees, and strong security features set it apart from traditional meme coins, making it a smart choice for investors seeking sustainable growth. With a presale selling out rapidly and a beta platform launch set to introduce groundbreaking crypto management tools, WLTQ is well-positioned for a significant 400% price explosion. By purchasing the WLTQ tokens at the current price of $0.0420 , those who get in now stand to gain the most.

In just 24 hours, an additional 400 investors joined the project, highlighting the strong demand for this emerging DeFi token. As the first presale phase nears its conclusion, investors are securing their tokens at $0.01, anticipating a 100% price increase in Phase Two. With its decentralized lending model, Mutuum Finance offers a unique opportunity for users to generate passive income while providing access to liquidity. The combination of strong market interest, structured tokenomics, and an upcoming platform launch has positioned MUTM as a high-potential investment in 2025. What Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance is a fully decentralized lending and borrowing protocol, designed to eliminate middlemen and put financial control back in the hands of users. Operating on smart contracts, the platform enables secure, automated lending and borrowing, allowing investors to maximize their crypto assets. The platform introduces two distinct lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Investors deposit assets into liquidity pools and receive mtTokens (such as mtETH or mtDAI), which accrue interest over time. This model ensures stable liquidity for borrowers while allowing lenders to earn passive income. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Users negotiate lending terms directly, unlocking borrowing options for tokens not supported in liquidity pools, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) or Pepe (PEPE) . This flexibility allows traders to access funds without selling their holdings. With a transparent and efficient approach, Mutuum Finance is addressing the growing demand for decentralized financial services. Why Investors Are Rushing to Mutuum Finance 1. Explosive Presale Growth Mutuum Finance has witnessed an exceptional presale performance, raising over $730,000 and attracting 400 new investors within 24 hours. With only a limited number of tokens available in Phase One, FOMO is growing as more investors rush to secure their position before the price moves up. 2. Passive Income with mtTokens Unlike speculative tokens, Mutuum Finance offers sustainable earning opportunities. By supplying assets to liquidity pools, investors receive mtTokens, which automatically accrue interest. For example, an investor who supplies $5,000 USDT at a 9% APY would earn an additional $450 in passive income over a year, without selling their initial investment. 3. Buy-and-Distribute Mechanism To create sustained demand, Mutuum Finance has implemented a buy-and-distribute mechanism. A share of the platform’s fees is allocated to buying back MUTM tokens, which are subsequently distributed to mtToken stakers. This process continuously drives demand, supporting price stability and benefiting long-term holders. Mutuum Finance is rapidly approaching its second presale phase, where the token price will increase from $0.01 to $0.015. Looking further ahead, by launch, MUTM is set to reach $0.06, representing a 600% surge. However, analysts suggest the price will go even higher, hitting $0.23 post-launch, marking a 2,300% increase. For instance, an investor purchasing 210,000 MUTM at $0.01 for $2,100 will see their holdings grow to $48,300 when the price reaches $0.23, showcasing the strong upside potential of early investment. With over 1,200 holders and $730K raised, Mutuum Finance is quickly proving to be one of the strongest DeFi contenders of 2025. Its decentralized lending platform, passive income opportunities, and innovative tokenomics have fueled growing investor interest. As Phase One nears completion, those looking to enter at the lowest possible price have limited time before the next price increase to $0.015.

40519444,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=699120,1739925027,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Bitcoin To $500,000: Standard Chartered Doubles Down On 2028 Target",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-500000-standard-chartered-2028-target/,"Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research, Geoffrey Kendrick, has reaffirmed his standout price forecast for Bitcoin. Kendrick, who envisions BTC hitting $500,000 by 2028, bases his conviction on evidence of increasing institutional involvement — specifically pointing to sovereign wealth funds, state pension funds, and other large-scale investors. Sovereign Wealth Funds Enter The Bitcoin Fray According to a new report from Standard Chartered cited by The Block, Kendrick sees growing signs that government-backed investment vehicles are ramping up their interest in Bitcoin. This view is reinforced by Abu Dhabi’s recent disclosure of a 4,700 BTC-equivalent position in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) via its sovereign wealth fund. Related Reading: Bitcoin Presents A ‘Generational Opportunity’ As Global Turmoil Intensifies, Says Bitwise Executive “While this is small for now, we would expect the size to increase over time and, indeed, for other sovereigns to also start buying,” Kendrick wrote in the Tuesday report. He explained that Abu Dhabi’s move marks a strategic shift and could presage broader participation from other wealth funds looking to diversify their portfolios with BTC. Kendrick’s confidence is partly rooted in Form 13F filings — quarterly reports that institutional managers overseeing at least $100 million in assets are required to file with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Reviewing data from the fourth quarter of 2024, Kendrick noted a compelling trend. “The 13F filings for Q4 show that process is underway…It is happening,” he said in an email to The Block. In Standard Chartered’s analysis, Q4 data revealed that while hedge funds maintained their lead in Bitcoin purchases, banks — which began buying in Q3 of last year — also ramped up their positions. Kendrick drew parallels between an earlier stage in Bitcoin’s market evolution, dominated by retail investors, and the more recent era, which saw hedge funds jump aboard through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Now, the spotlight appears to be broadening further to include state investment managers and central banks. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Big Breakout? Fed’s “Not QE, QE” Just Flipped The Switch “This gives us comfort to say that even if buying by Strategy… [formerly MicroStrategy] slows down dramatically (it has bought a staggering 227k BTC since the US election, more than 1% of the ever-to-exist supply), we think other buyers are waiting to step in,” Kendrick noted. The mention of MicroStrategy underscores just how significant one private company’s bitcoin holdings can be. Yet Standard Chartered’s analysis suggests that other large, patient pools of capital might absorb future supply, thus supporting higher prices over the long term. Among the institutions, Kendrick highlights the State of Wisconsin Investment Board and the State of Michigan Department of the Treasury. However, he also points to central banks as potential new participants. In the report, Kendrick references the Czech National Bank, which has considered allocating up to 5% of its €140 billion in reserves into bitcoin, and notes that the Swiss National Bank is in the early stages of contemplating a similar move. These developments could further bolster bitcoin’s legitimacy as a store of value on par with more traditional asset classes. “As institutional access to bitcoin improves and volatility declines, we expect more portfolios to migrate towards their optimal level from an underweight Bitcoin starting point,” Kendrick concluded. At press time, BTC traded at $95,581.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Pentoshi tells his 855,900 followers on the social media platform X that the OTHERS weekly chart, which tracks the total market cap of crypto excluding the 10 largest digital assets and stablecoins, is flashing bullish. “Liking [last weekly candle]… [This] week higher for your favorite cryptocurrency coins in my opinion.” Source: Pentoshi/X He believes that the OTHERS chart may soon have a series of rallies and flip the $281 billion resistance level on the weekly chart into support. “These are going to likely be the most decisive spots in terms of trends, entries and exits for the foreseeable future. $250 billion is where we took longs and is very close to an HTF (high time frame) invalidation level which makes it cheap if wrong. $281 billion is our local resistance, but we want to see it end up towards $320 billion-ish. Again, we could chop here. $320 billion is a great partial exit point and if it flips it can get back in etc. Which makes it also cheap if wrong, since you don’t have to pay much for confirmation of further upside at that point.” Source: Pentoshi/X The OTHERS is trading at $271.46 billion at time of writing. Looking at Bitcoin, Pentoshi says that BTC looks strong despite an onslaught of bearish news. “It’s crazy. All that’s taken place in the last few months, and this is what BTC looks like.” Source: Pentoshi/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $96,228. Earlier this month, Pentoshi predicted that the crypto market cap may hit a valuation of $4.42 trillion as soon as the first quarter of this year. “Probably this quarter.” Source: Pentoshi/X At time of writing, the total market cap of crypto stands at $3.134 trillion.

Polkadot and HBAR are making headlines with major advancements. Polkadot is improving its blockchain by enhancing scalability and cross-chain communication, securing its role as a crucial Polkadot crypto in the blockchain sector. At the same time, HBAR is seeing price growth fueled by strategic alliances and tech upgrades, showing strong potential. But there’s more to watch. Web3Bay is entering the e-commerce sector with a fresh approach, removing middlemen and making transactions more direct. This change doesn’t just cut fees—it transforms how buyers and sellers connect. With its blockchain use, Web3Bay is emerging as a key player for those looking at practical crypto applications. Could this be the start of decentralized platforms that are challenging big names like Amazon and eBay? Web3Bay: Pioneering the Online Shopping Web3Bay is shifting the traditional e-commerce structure that companies like Amazon and eBay dominate. By cutting out unnecessary intermediaries, it allows buyers and sellers to interact directly. This setup reduces extra costs, meaning consumers pay less while sellers earn more. As e-commerce continues growing, Web3Bay’s model could reshape online shopping, making it fairer and more efficient. Web3Bay’s presale of its native coin, 3BAY, is gaining attention, making it one of the most talked-about blockchain projects. With an affordable entry price, 3BAY presents a chance for those wanting to be part of a project aiming for long-term growth. The presale has already exceeded $1.4 million, reflecting strong confidence in Web3Bay’s approach to blockchain-powered e-commerce. As Polkadot and HBAR continue advancing in the crypto market, Web3Bay stands out for applying blockchain in a real-world sector worth trillions. Its push for decentralized commerce could mark a major step in how online businesses operate. With an ongoing presale and plans to disrupt e-commerce, Web3Bay is drawing interest from both blockchain supporters and e-commerce enthusiasts alike. Polkadot Crypto: Expanding Blockchain’s Reach Polkadot isn’t just another blockchain—it’s a multi-chain system creating new possibilities for blockchain interaction. By enabling secure cross-chain transfers of data and digital assets, Polkadot connects different blockchain networks under a single security system. This function makes it a vital part of the future of decentralized applications. With constant updates and an expanding ecosystem, Polkadot crypto is an attractive choice for developers building the next generation of blockchain applications. Its ability to link public and private chains, permissioned and permissionless networks, and even upcoming technologies put it at the forefront of blockchain evolution. Instead of following trends, Polkadot is actively shaping the future of blockchain interoperability. HBAR’s Price Surge: A Growing Force in Crypto HBAR, the digital currency of Hedera Hashgraph, is gaining attention due to its rising value and technological improvements. Using its unique hashgraph consensus method, HBAR provides better speed, security, and scalability compared to standard blockchain setups. These features make it a strong competitor in the cryptocurrency sector. Recent strategic moves and key partnerships have further reinforced HBAR’s role in the market. With more institutions getting involved and increased funding in its ecosystem, HBAR isn’t just benefiting from market trends—it’s creating its own path. These advancements signal a bright future, placing HBAR among the standout names in the crypto industry. Final Thoughts Polkadot crypto and HBAR’s price surge highlight key advancements shaping blockchain’s future. Polkadot continues to lead in making blockchains work together seamlessly, making it a preferred choice for developers. Similarly, HBAR’s improvements in transaction efficiency and security are positioning it as a major competitor. Amidst these developments, Web3Bay is taking its place in the e-commerce sector . By using blockchain to remove middlemen, it lowers costs for buyers while boosting seller profits. This approach challenges traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay, making Web3Bay an interesting choice for those looking at blockchain applications beyond trading. As blockchain technology continues advancing, these projects present exciting opportunities for those keeping an eye on the market.

Texas, the Bitcoin capital of the US, is home to many digital asset companies seeking to leverage the state’s deregulated electricity market, renewable energy resources, and favorable regulatory environment. Several prominent industry leaders have established operations in Texas, including Bitmain and Great American Mining (acquired by Crusoe Energy) have set up operations in the Lone Star state. The company previously established a 200MW data center in Garden City, Texas, which draws its power from an adjacent wind farm. MARA Holdings’ Texas wind farm acquisition The newly acquired wind farm offers 240 megawatts (MW) of interconnection capacity and 114 MW of nameplate wind capacity. MARA Holdings intends to repurpose last-generation ASIC mining hardware that would otherwise have been discarded at this facility. The company will also be utilizing 100% renewable energy to power these machines, so the center will be run at zero marginal cost. This sustainable approach not only extends the operational life of existing equipment but also reduces Bitcoin production costs through vertical integration. Fred Thiel, MARA’s chairman and CEO, stated , “The closing of this acquisition represents a significant milestone in MARA’s ongoing transformation as we expand our asset base, following our strategic shift from an asset-light to an asset-heavy business model.” With this move, the company is a step closer to achieving near net-zero operating costs. The sustainable mining movement is gaining steam MARA Holdings’ sustainable approach to cryptocurrency mining is in line with the recent trend of addressing environmental concerns and energy consumption challenges with renewable energy. Cryptocurrency mining is an energy-intensive activity and many crypto mining companies are actively working to reduce energy costs while increasing their mining capacity. Countries like Russia and Iran have faced energy challenges due to crypto mining, resulting in blackouts and power shortages. Rather than invest in a renewable power source, these countries instead imposed restrictions and crackdowns on cryptocurrency mining. Companies like HIVE Digital Technologies and Iris Energy are taking the sustainability route. HIVE Digital Technologies intends to target 2% of the global Bitcoin mining capacity. The company plans to achieve this by expanding its operations to 15 EH/s by the end of 2025 via hydroelectric power. MARA Holdings has several data centers running on renewable energy. The company now has two centers in Texas including the new wind farm, two in Ohio and one in Finland. The data centers have a capacity of about 438 MW between them and function with different energy sources, including wind and heat. When the planned expansions and developments are completed that number will rise to 688 MW. The company’s sixth data center in Findlay, Ohio is still in development and is expected to be fully functional by the end of 2025.

It touched an intraday peak of 6,129.63 earlier, pushing its year-to-date gains to 4.5%, according to data from Google Finance. Investors keep piling in, even as inflation worries and President Donald Trump’s trade policies hang over the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average barely moved though, adding 10 points, or 0.02%, to land at 44,556.34, and the Nasdaq Composite managed to close at 20,041.26, gaining 0.07%, per Google Finance data. Stock futures didn’t do much overnight, with S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures edging up less than 0.01%, while Dow futures added 18 points, or 0.04%, according to data from CNBC. Meta drops as earnings shake up after-hours trading Not every stock had a winning day. Shares of the Facebook and Instagram parent ended the day 2.76% lower at $716.37 a share. The stock is up 22.35% this year, making it the winning name of the ‘Magnificent 7’ group of U.S. megacap technology companies. Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler, said in a note that the market is staying strong despite negative sentiment. “The stock market’s resiliency has been impressive year-to-date as investors refuse to ‘back down’ in the face of rising negative sentiment and concerns about tariff and inflation headlines,” he said. The stock market has actually been on a wild run for two years. The S&P 500 gained 23% in 2024 and 24% in 2023. With dividends, those numbers jump to 25% and 26%, but JPMorgan analysts say a repeat in 2025 not likely. Since 1928, this kind of winning streak has only happened once—during the late 1990s tech boom. Historically, the US stock market averages 10% annual returns, according to data from Dimensional. Adjusted for inflation, that drops to 6.5%-7%, a trend that McKinsey data tracks back to 1800. Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, said investors have been spoiled by back-to-back 20% years. Scott Wren, a senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, doesn’t see another 20%+ gain happening. “Do we expect an S&P 500 Index three-peat in 2025? In short, no,” he wrote in a Wednesday market note.

So, we have institutions and banks of all sizes supervised by the Fed that are engaged in crypto-related activities, either themselves directly or supporting clients who do crypto work. Our expectation is they do that in a safe and sound way. Michael Barr The Vice-Chair also highlighted that the Federal Reserve has a supervision program for institutions dealing with digital assets. Some banks managed this sector well, while others encountered liquidity issues or compliance issues that caused their downfall. According to Barr’s remarks on risk management in the banking sector, it is worth pursuing if you do it correctly and effectively; if you do not do it properly, then it’s best to avoid it. Barr’s surprise exit clears path for Trump to reshape Fed leadership Barr announced last month that he will step down on Feb. 28, in a surprise move that will avert a potentially messy legal fight with President-elect Donald Trump, who is now free to replace him with an official of his choosing. Barr said he was stepping down as the central bank’s vice chair for supervision over a year before his term was set to expire in July 2026 but planned to keep his seat on the Fed’s Board of Governors. His term on the board is set to last until 2032. Barr initially told Congress in November that he intended to serve out his term, but since then, he has concluded that doing so could risk a potentially harmful dispute with the Trump administration, which the Washington Post reported in October has considered demoting Barr from his regulatory post. Barr’s exit adds uncertainty to the fate of US regulators’ proposal requiring major lenders to hold more capital to safeguard against losses and financial crises. The KBW Bank Index climbed as much as 2.4% to the highest intraday since Dec. 16, after the Fed announced that Barr would step down from the position. Barr has played a crucial role in negotiations for the proposal, which intends to prevent future bank failures and a financial crisis. The financial industry has lobbied aggressively against the new requirements, which as of now call for a 19% capital increase for the largest US banks, such as Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. In September, he previewed proposed changes that would lower that increase to 9%. Those revisions drew opposition from at least three out of five directors at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Barr’s recent remarks reflect ongoing tensions between regulators and the banking industry over digital assets and financial inclusion.

With new projects launching every day, the crypto space is buzzing with opportunities. But not all meme coins are created equal—some bring real innovation, while others ride the hype train. In the past week, Andy announced a major partnership set to reshape its ecosystem, while Cat in a Dog’s World made waves with a record-breaking presale milestone. But the real showstopper? Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) —a meme coin redefining presales with its unique “traveling” approach and aggressive token burn strategy. This article dives into the latest updates on Arctic Pablo Coin, Andy, and Cat in a Dog’s World. Let’s explore why these three are among the Best New Meme Coins for Massive Return Potential this year. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Power | Best New Meme Coins for Massive Return Potential One of the standout features of Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is its revolutionary token burn mechanism. Unlike other projects that schedule occasional burns, APC systematically removes unsold tokens every week during the presale. And that’s not all—any remaining tokens post-presale will also be permanently burned, creating a deflationary effect that drives scarcity and enhances long-term value. With all burns being publicly recorded on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), investors can track every transaction, ensuring transparency and trust. Presale Structure – A Journey Across Locations Rather than traditional presale stages, Arctic Pablo Coin takes a unique travel-inspired approach. Instead of fixed phases, APC “travels” through different icy locations, marking new milestones with each presale price increase. Current Presale Price: $0.000063 Current Location: Blizzard Bay Total Raised: Over $1.41 Million Launch Price: $0.008 ROI Potential: Over 12,618.77% from current phase to launch Staking and Rewards APY: 66% during presale—stake and earn rewards. Referral Incentives: Spread the word and get rewarded. Community Competitions: Win APC tokens and USD. With such a dynamic structure and an aggressive burn strategy, Arctic Pablo Coin is shaping up as one of the Best New Meme Coins for Massive Return Potential in 2024. The Arctic Adventure Continues – Limited-Time Entry at Frostburg The Arctic Pablo Coin presale has been a whirlwind, with locations selling out in record time. The expedition has already conquered nine locations in under a month, and now, the coin is making waves in Frostburg with an entry price of just $0.000059. With every new stop, the presale price climbs—meaning early investors secure the best possible returns. Arctic Pablo’s 11th phase, Aqua Frost, is already attracting a surge of buyers, pushing the total raise beyond $1.41 million. Miss this phase, and the price only gets higher. With an ROI potential exceeding 12,618.77%, those who secure APC now stand to gain the most. Don’t wait—this Arctic journey is moving fast! Andy Expands Its Ecosystem with New Partnership The meme coin Andy has announced a game-changing partnership with a top-tier blockchain infrastructure provider. This collaboration aims to enhance Andy’s utility and ecosystem, introducing new staking opportunities and DeFi integrations. The market has responded positively, with Andy’s trading volume spiking 45% in 24 hours. As the project continues to evolve, investors are keeping a close eye on its next moves. Cat in a Dog’s World Hits Presale Record Cat in a Dog’s World is turning heads with its explosive presale success. The project has now raised over $3.2 million, shattering previous meme coin presale records. This surge in interest comes after the announcement of a major NFT integration, allowing token holders to access exclusive in-game assets. With growing community hype and a rapidly expanding user base, Cat in a Dog’s World is proving to be a serious contender in the meme coin space. Final Thoughts – Which Meme Coin Will Dominate? Each of these projects is making waves in its own way, but Arctic Pablo Coin stands out with its innovative presale structure, deflationary tokenomics, and explosive ROI potential. While Andy’s new partnership and Cat in a Dog’s World’s presale records add to the excitement, Arctic Pablo Coin’s strategic token burns and limited-time low entry price make it a prime candidate for massive gains. With presale locations selling out fast, now is the time to secure APC before it moves to its next price hike!

Worldcoin is capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts in equal measure. In the first week of May, Worldcoin’s token, WLD, saw a dramatic rise in its value, positioning it as one of the top-performing altcoins in the market. This surge coincides with heightened activity around artificial intelligence (AI) advancements, particularly those involving OpenAI, hinting at a significant correlation between WLD’s market movements and developments in AI technology. The buzz is partly attributed to speculative reports about potential collaborations and new ventures that could integrate more AI tools into cryptocurrency.

RSI is near oversold; MACD hints at a possible bullish crossover. Key levels to watch are the resistance at $1.20 and support at $1.10 for short-term moves. Worldcoin price analysis on February 18th shows WLD has been under persistent selling pressure since mid-December 2024, leading to a sharp decline of over 56%. The downturn has erased all the gains from its November bull run, leaving traders uncertain about the asset’s future movement. Despite the ongoing downtrend, there are signs of a potential recovery. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted that WLD is flashing multiple buy signals on the weekly timeframe using the TD Sequential indicator. This suggests that the bearish momentum might weaken, hinting at a possible price reversal. Martinez’s analysis indicates that WLD’s buy signals have appeared around the $1.286 mark, a potential entry point for traders looking to capitalize on a rebound. However, as of today, WLD’s price is $1.14, reflecting a 4.64% decline over the past 24 hours. WLD daily chart analysis: Potential reversal in sight Worldcoin’s daily chart exhibits a prolonged downtrend with the price hovering around $1.13. The asset remains below key resistance levels, indicating weak bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 30.85, approaching oversold territory. This suggests that selling pressure could be nearing exhaustion, increasing the probability of a short-term bounce. WLD daily chart analysis: Potential reversal in sight The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator remains in negative territory, with the MACD line at -0.1846 and the signal line at -0.2022. However, a potential bullish crossover is forming, which could indicate a shift in momentum. If the price stabilizes and breaks above immediate resistance at $1.20, an upward movement toward $1.286 could materialize. Conversely, failure to hold current support levels could drive WLD lower toward $1.05. WLD 4-hour chart analysis: Short-term support holding The 4-hour chart shows WLD consolidating near $1.132 after a recent decline. The RSI stands at 36.66, suggesting the asset is still under selling pressure but gradually approaching oversold conditions. If the RSI crosses above 40, it could indicate a strengthening bullish momentum. WLD 4-hour chart analysis: Short-term support holding The Bollinger Bands have widened, reflecting increased volatility. An increase in buying volume could push the price toward the $1.18-$1.20 resistance zone. On the downside, failure to hold current levels could lead to a retest of the $1.10 support level. WLD’s technical indicators suggest that while the asset is still in a bearish phase, early signs of a potential reversal are emerging. Traders should closely watch resistance at $1.20 and support at $1.10 for further price action confirmation.

Authorities determined that the financial incentives tied to the program could unduly influence participants’ decisions, raising significant ethical concerns. The suspension of Worldcoin’s operations in Brazil took effect the following day, January 25. Is Worldcoin a good investment? Investing in Worldcoin offers the opportunity to be part of a cryptocurrency project that leverages biometric verification and zero-knowledge proofs to enhance asset security and privacy. Its approach prevents impersonation and supports Universal Basic Income (UBI) distribution, potentially reducing economic inequality. The upcoming World Chain Layer 2 platform, backed by Ethereum’s security, promises efficient user onboarding and robust blockchain operations. These advancements position Worldcoin as a forward-thinking investment in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Will Worldcoin recover? The current WLD’s price action shows volatility and a slight recovery, suggesting that the cryptocurrency may have the potential for recovery. However, future performance will depend on the crypto market conditions and investor sentiment. Will Worldcoin reach $5? According to long-term predictions, the Worldcoin price forecast expects WLD to reach $5 by 2028. Will Worldcoin reach $100? Worldcoin prediction to reach $100 is highly unlikely due to current market conditions, its present price levels, and the significant rise in market capitalization required. Such an increase would necessitate extraordinary growth and adoption. Does Worldcoin have an excellent long-term future? WLD coin is showing some recovery trend; the token may have a promising long-term future. Continued development, adoption, and favorable market trends will be crucial for its success. Worldcoin recent news Worldcoin’s ecosystem continues to expand, with its World ID system now active in over 80 countries, with plans to increase that number to 120. The project has also launched biometric scanning devices, known as Orbs, in various global cities, including Berlin, Dubai, London, and New York City. These developments contribute to its long-term adoption and credibility. Sam Altman’s AI-driven cryptocurrency startup, World, is reportedly finalizing a lease for approximately 60,000 square feet at Mission Rock’s Building B in San Francisco, marking its latest expansion near OpenAI’s growing presence in the city’s waterfront district.

Potentially entering a new price discovery phase for the first time in seven years, analysts suggest a possible surge to new record highs. Bullish Targets For XRP Price In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), technical analyst Dark Defender indicated that the XRP price consolidation has concluded, as evidenced by the lows in the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Gearing Up for Gains—Can Bulls Sustain The Momentum? The analyst posits that a “wave 3” rally may be set to launch, targeting a price of $5.85, which would represent an impressive 129% increase from its XRP’s current trading level of $2.55. Further reinforcing his bullish outlook, Dark Defender identified another ambitious target for XRP, suggesting it could nearly triple its previous all-time high of $3.40, aiming for a new target of $8.76, which implies a potential 243% uptrend from current levels. In addition, Dark Defender pointed to key support levels for the XRP price in the short-term, currently established at $1.88 and $2.33. The latter has proven to be a critical threshold, preventing further declines amid a turbulent market characterized by broader cryptocurrency sell-offs. On the upside, however, the XRP price may face major resistance at the $2.66 and $3.12 levels, which previously served as support before the extension of the recent downtrend for the altcoin. Should the XRP price manage to break free from its current consolidation phase and reclaim the $3 mark, additional resistance could emerge at $3.29 and $3.38, levels that previously thwarted attempts to surpass the $3.40 record. SEC Acknowledges Grayscale’s XRP ETF Filing A significant legal development in the US could serve as a catalyst for these anticipated price movements. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently acknowledged Grayscale’s filing for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF), signaling potential advancements toward the approval of such investment vehicles. This development follows a shift in the SEC’s leadership, with the departure of Gary Gensler, who oversaw the lawsuit against Ripple Labs—an action that stifled XRP’s price for nearly four years, confining it to a narrow trading range of $0.30 to $0.50. Related Reading: Bitcoin Unable To Break Upward As 1.6 Million BTC Resistance Wall Blocks Path The current administration under President Donald Trump is seen as adopting a different approach to regulatory oversight compared to the previous Biden administration. The new SEC leadership may promote a more favorable environment for cryptocurrencies beyond the approvals of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year, which have significantly increased their adoption and attracted capital inflows.

His role includes managing a workforce of approximately 50,000 employees while implementing the administration’s trade policies. Lutnick is expected to work alongside Jamieson Greer, Trump’s nominee for trade negotiator, to enforce tariff policies aimed at reshaping US trade relationships. He has voiced support for imposing tariffs on a country-by-country basis, arguing that they will encourage foreign governments to lower trade barriers for American goods.

With its decentralized lending platform, structured presale, and real-world utility, this project is drawing significant attention from early investors. Analysts predict that its value could surge by 4000%, making it a compelling option for those seeking long-term gains. As the presale advances, more investors are securing their positions before the price climbs in the next phase. With a strong foundation, growing community, and a roadmap designed for sustainable growth, Mutuum Finance will be a standout investment in the evolving DeFi world. Here are three key reasons why this token deserves a spot in your portfolio. Three Reasons to Invest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a high-potential DeFi project, gaining traction among investors looking for long-term growth. With its decentralized lending model, structured tokenomics, and upcoming exchange listings, experts believe it will experience a 4000% surge. Here’s why this token deserves a spot in your portfolio. 1. Real-World Utility with Lending and Stablecoin Integration Unlike many speculative tokens, MUTM powers a decentralized lending and borrowing platform, offering real financial utility. Users can supply crypto assets to liquidity pools, earning passive income while borrowers access funds by providing collateral. Additionally, the team is developing an overcollateralized stablecoin, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar on Ethereum’s blockchain, ensuring liquidity and stability. These features make MUTM a functional asset, not just another presale token. 2. Early Investment Advantage Before Price Surge Mutuum Finance is still in its presale phase, offering the lowest possible entry price before it moves to exchanges. Currently priced at $0.01, the token is set to rise to $0.015 in Phase 2, creating a limited-time opportunity for early buyers. With over 68 million tokens already sold in a short period, demand is rising, and analysts expect the presale to sell out quickly before its exchange listing. 3. Potential 4000% Surge and High Growth Expectations Experts predict that MUTM will skyrocket 4000% in value, driven by its growing demand, strong DeFi adoption, and upcoming exchange listings. For instance, if an investor buys $500 worth of MUTM at $0.01, their holdings will be worth $20,500 at a 4000% increase. Similarly, $1,000 invested today will turn into $41,000, making this a high-return opportunity for early inventors. Why Mutuum Finance Stands Out Beyond its presale success, Mutuum Finance is built for long-term sustainability. Unlike centralized lending platforms, it operates fully on smart contracts, ensuring transparency and eliminating third-party control. Its strategic tokenomics include allocations for liquidity incentives, ecosystem growth, and lending rewards, creating a strong foundation for continued price appreciation. Additionally, Mutuum’s buy-and-distribute mechanism enhances long-term value. A portion of fees collected on the platform is used to repurchase MUTM tokens, which are then distributed to mtToken stakers, rewarding those who actively engage with the ecosystem. With a fast-growing community, upcoming beta launch, and rising investor interest, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a leading DeFi contender. As decentralized finance adoption expands, tokens like MUTM that provide real-world solutions are expected to perform exceptionally well in the next bull market.

While previous cycles saw assets like Cardano (ADA) and XRP delivering staggering gains, emerging technologies are now setting the stage for the next bull run. Crypto AI algorithms have been scanning the market, identifying hidden gems with the highest growth potential. One name that continues to surface is RCO Finance (RCOF) , an upcoming best altcoin to buy for the 2025 bull run, poised to disrupt the market and deliver exponential gains. RCO Finance (RCOF): The Top Crypto AI Features Crypto AI algorithms are no longer just tools for market speculation; they have become essential instruments in identifying undervalued assets with real-world utility. RCO Finance has been singled out as a frontrunner for the best altcoin to invest in ahead of the 2025 bull run. Unlike speculative memecoins, RCOF integrates artificial intelligence into decentralized finance (DeFi), bridging traditional finance (TradFi) with the future of digital assets. RCO Finance’s ecosystem is built around its crypto AI Robo Advisor, which analyzes live market data from sources like Bloomberg and Reuters. This innovative tool assists investors in making informed decisions by pinpointing optimal market entry and exit points, mitigating risks, and maximizing returns. RCOF uses predictive analytics and automated trading strategies to help users stay ahead of market trends. For example, when the Test (TST) token recently surged and dropped while listed on Binance, RCO Finance’s robo-advisor could have identified optimal entry and exit points, allowing investors to secure profits before the downturn. Beyond its crypto AI insights, RCO Finance offers an unmatched variety of investment options. With access to over 120,000 assets across 12,500 asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, tokenized real-world assets, stocks, ETFs, bonds, and real estate, investors can construct diverse and resilient portfolios. One of RCO Finance’s defining features is its non-KYC framework, allowing users to engage with the platform while maintaining complete privacy. RCOF eliminates traditional barriers, enabling seamless onboarding. The smart contract audits conducted by SolidProof further ensure the security and transparency of the platform. RCO Finance is not just about passive investing, it is designed to empower active traders. The platform incorporates a crypto AI Automated Market Making (AMM) and liquidity pools, allowing users to stake assets, provide liquidity, and earn substantial rewards. For high-risk, high-reward traders, RCOF offers leverage options of up to 1000x on selected assets. This unique feature enables users to amplify gains while maintaining control over their trading strategies. Moreover, as the holders of the best altcoin to buy, investors receive exclusive discounts on trading fees, incentivizing long-term participation in the ecosystem. RCO Finance has already captured widespread investor interest. Following the platform’s beta launch , over 10,000 new users onboarded, propelling presale figures past the $13 million mark. With an alpha launch scheduled soon, demand is expected to surge even further. Market analysts anticipate that RCO Finance could become one of the most influential DeFi projects of the next bull cycle. Given its crypto AI integration, security focus, and expansive asset selection, RCOF is already drawing comparisons to previous market leaders like Solana and Ethereum before their explosive rallies. Why RCO Finance (RCOF) is the Best Altcoin to Buy for the 2025 Bull Run Currently, RCO Finance is in Stage 5 of its token presale, with RCOF tokens priced at $0.10. Analysts project that once listed on major exchanges, the token’s price could rise to $0.40-$0.60, delivering an ROI of up to 600%. Some bullish projections suggest a 700x surge by Q2 2025, potentially mirroring Dogecoin’s historic rise. Staking RCOF tokens offers additional advantages, including high APYs of up to 86% and liquidity incentives. Investors who get in early will benefit from price appreciation and exclusive access to AI-powered financial tools that redefine crypto investing. RCO Finance holders gain access to cash rewards and gift prizes exceeding $100,000, along with frequent airdrop opportunities, quarterly dividends ranging from 1-6%, priority customer support, and exclusive access to private syndicate ETF funds. With the market rapidly evolving into crypto AI and DeFi innovations, RCO Finance is positioning itself as the best altcoin to buy for 2025, setting the stage for what could be a record-breaking bull run.

XRP is gaining attention as discussions around an ETF gain traction, potentially making it more accessible to mainstream financial markets. Meanwhile, Solana’s (SOL) price analysis suggests a bullish trend, signaling potential market growth. At the same time, Web3Bay is emerging as a major player in online shopping by using blockchain to eliminate middlemen, reducing costs for buyers while ensuring higher earnings for sellers. This shift enhances efficiency and brings fairness to the digital marketplace. Web3Bay is showing how blockchain technology can be applied practically in daily transactions, positioning itself as a strong name in the Web3 cryptocurrency sector. Web3Bay: Changing Online Shopping with Blockchain Web3Bay is introducing a new way to buy online, leveraging blockchain to remove unnecessary intermediaries. By doing this, sellers can retain a larger share of earnings, and buyers benefit from lower prices. The platform ensures safe, clear transactions, making online shopping more reliable and transparent for everyone. With the expansion of Web3-based cryptocurrencies, Web3Bay is integrating blockchain into everyday online transactions. This approach makes shopping smoother and more affordable, avoiding the high fees imposed by large e-commerce platforms. Blockchain in Web3Bay is not just a concept but a real tool for improving online shopping, benefiting buyers and sellers alike. Web3Bay is not only improving e-commerce but also demonstrating how blockchain can be used in practical ways. While XRP is working towards an ETF to increase financial accessibility, Web3Bay is bringing blockchain technology directly to e-commerce, showing that digital advancements can make real-world shopping easier. The growing interest in the project is reflected in its presale, which has raised over $1.4 million and sold more than 360 million coins. The fourth stage of the presale is witnessing strong demand, with 3BAY coins available at $0.004562. XRP ETF: Expanding Access to the Market As XRP continues through the regulatory process, the idea of an XRP ETF is gaining more attention. If approved, this could allow XRP to be traded on major financial platforms, making it easier for a wider audience to access. An ETF would not only increase the reach of XRP but also bring more stability and credibility to its position in the financial market. The anticipation around the SEC’s decision reflects a larger interest in cryptocurrency being integrated into mainstream finance. If an ETF is approved, it could drive up XRP’s value significantly, making it more attractive to traders. This move highlights XRP’s potential beyond digital currency, showing its growing role in the financial system. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis: Growth Signals in the Market Solana is gaining attention for its strong technical foundation and increasing adoption, making it a key subject in Solana (SOL) price analysis. As the platform improves its technology and scales up, interest from developers and traders continues to rise. This sustained momentum suggests a positive trend for Solana’s future price movements. In addition, Solana is expanding into important areas such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs. These integrations add to the platform’s long-term appeal and could push its value higher. Solana’s capabilities make it a strong presence in the cryptocurrency sector, and a recent Solana (SOL) price analysis indicates a promising outlook for its continued growth. Final Thoughts With the expected changes surrounding XRP ETF and the strengthening market position of Solana (SOL), cryptocurrency continues to see notable shifts. The approval of an XRP ETF could open doors for wider access, making XRP more appealing to traders. Meanwhile, Solana’s continuous advancements are securing its place as a significant digital asset. At the same time, Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce by applying blockchain to improve online shopping. By removing middlemen, it ensures better earnings for sellers and lower costs for buyers. These ongoing developments highlight how blockchain is making a direct impact on both financial markets and everyday commerce, bringing real advantages to users.

Uniswap revolutionized token trading by eliminating intermediaries, while Aave reshaped lending with decentralized liquidity pools. Both have expanded significantly, with Uniswap processing trillions in trades and Aave securing billions in deposits. However, BlockDAG has outpaced expectations, surpassing 140,000 holders and raising nearly $200 million. Unlike its predecessors, BlockDAG’s success is fueled by continuous engagement through AMA sessions, transparent development, and a rapidly expanding ecosystem. With its mainnet launch approaching, BlockDAG is proving to be more than just another DeFi project—it’s a transformative force. BlockDAG’s AMA Sessions Drive Global Adoption, Surging Past 140K Holders BlockDAG’s commitment to transparency and regular engagement has propelled its presale to unprecedented heights, transforming it from a promising project into a major force in the crypto space. Notably, with over 140,000 unique holders—a sharp rise from 92,000 just months ago—BlockDAG’s open communication through AMA sessions has played a key role in building trust and excitement among investors. Moreover, the numbers speak for themselves. BlockDAG’s presale fundraising has now nearly reached $200 million, with over 18.5 billion BDAG coins sold. Currently in batch 27, BDAG is priced at $0.0248, marking an astonishing 2,340% ROI since batch 1. This rapid growth is fueled by a mix of retail investors and institutional backers who recognize BlockDAG’s potential as it moves toward its mainnet launch. Furthermore, past AMAs have provided critical insights into the testnet launch, mining innovations, and upcoming partnerships, cementing BlockDAG’s position as a serious player. With the next AMA scheduled for February 20, the community is eager for more updates on the project’s roadmap, exchange listings, and ecosystem expansion. As a result, BlockDAG isn’t just another crypto project—it’s a movement backed by an engaged and growing community. As excitement builds, all eyes are on the next AMA to see what’s next for this record-breaking presale. Ultimately, will this be the session that pushes BlockDAG past the $200 million milestone? Uniswap: Transforming Decentralized Trading Uniswap launched in 2018 as an automated market maker (AMM) protocol, allowing users to trade ERC-20 tokens directly from their wallets without intermediaries. Specifically, created by Hayden Adams, Uniswap introduced liquidity pools where users deposit token pairs to facilitate decentralized swaps. This innovation replaced traditional order books, ensuring continuous liquidity. Since its launch, Uniswap has processed over $2.6 trillion in trading volume. Additionally, the release of Uniswap v4 in early 2025 enhanced efficiency by reducing gas fees and offering advanced features. UNI, the platform’s governance token, has rewarded early investors significantly. As of February 18, 2025, UNI is priced at $9.67, maintaining its position as a major DeFi asset. With ongoing upgrades and market adoption, Uniswap continues to lead decentralized exchanges. Consequently, its open-source model, permissionless nature, and scalability improvements position it as a key player in the evolution of DeFi trading solutions. Aave: Decentralized Lending at Scale Aave originated as ETHLend in 2017 before rebranding in 2018 and shifting to a liquidity pool model. As a result, it enables users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies without intermediaries, earning interest on deposits while borrowers secure loans through overcollateralization. This model revolutionized lending by eliminating centralized control. By the end of 2024, Aave’s total deposits exceeded $35 billion, a sharp rise from $5.5 billion in 2022. Additionally, its support for multiple assets and flexible borrowing options contributed to its expansion. As of February 18, 2025, AAVE trades at $255.05, reflecting the protocol’s sustained demand and investor confidence. Moreover, Aave’s continuous development, including layer-2 integrations and new lending mechanisms, keeps it at the forefront of decentralized finance. By offering efficient capital deployment and competitive interest rates, Aave remains a dominant force in the lending sector, attracting both institutional and retail participants seeking non-custodial financial solutions. Final Take Growth and adoption define a project’s long-term impact, and few have sustained momentum like Uniswap, Aave, and BlockDAG. Uniswap reshaped decentralized trading, Aave transformed lending, and both continue to attract investors. However, BlockDAG has set itself apart with record-breaking presale numbers, surpassing 140,000 holders and nearing $200 million in funding.

The Financial Services Commission (FSC) is poised to announce sanctions against Upbit, South Korea’s leading cryptocurrency exchange. This decisive action stems from alleged failures in meeting critical customer verification requirements, a cornerstone of anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. Why is Upbit Facing Potential Sanctions? Understanding Crypto Exchange Sanctions The looming crypto exchange sanctions against Upbit are not arbitrary. They are the result of a rigorous inspection conducted by the FSC’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). This investigation, initiated in August of the previous year during Upbit’s virtual asset service provider (VASP) license renewal process, unearthed significant concerns. The FIU reportedly discovered hundreds of thousands of instances where Upbit allegedly fell short of anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. A key area of concern was the exchange’s adherence to Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, which are mandatory for preventing illicit activities within the digital asset space. To put it simply, KYC and AML regulations are designed to ensure that crypto exchanges know who their customers are and can effectively prevent their platforms from being used for money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illegal activities. Failing to meet these standards can have severe consequences, as Upbit is now discovering. South Korean Crypto Regulation: A Closer Look at the Crackdown This situation underscores the increasingly stringent stance of South Korean crypto regulation . South Korea has emerged as a major hub for cryptocurrency trading and innovation. However, with this prominence comes increased scrutiny from regulators determined to protect investors and maintain financial integrity. The FSC’s investigation and potential sanctions against Upbit are a clear signal that Korean authorities are serious about enforcing compliance within the digital asset sector. Here’s a breakdown of what this regulatory focus means for the crypto industry in South Korea: Investor Protection: The primary goal is to safeguard investors from fraud, market manipulation, and other risks associated with cryptocurrencies. AML/KYC Enforcement: Strict adherence to anti-money laundering and Know Your Customer regulations is non-negotiable for crypto exchanges operating in South Korea. Market Stability: Regulators aim to create a stable and transparent crypto market that fosters innovation while mitigating systemic risks. International Standards: South Korea is aligning its crypto regulations with international standards set by bodies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The Core Issue: KYC AML Compliance and Its Importance At the heart of the matter lies KYC AML compliance . These are not just bureaucratic hurdles; they are essential for maintaining the legitimacy and security of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Let’s delve deeper into why KYC and AML are so critical: Aspect Importance Preventing Money Laundering KYC and AML procedures help identify and prevent criminals from using crypto exchanges to launder illicit funds. Combating Terrorist Financing By verifying customer identities and monitoring transactions, exchanges can help prevent funds from reaching terrorist organizations. Protecting Users from Fraud KYC measures can deter fraudsters and make it harder for them to operate anonymously on crypto platforms. Building Trust in the Crypto Market Robust KYC/AML compliance enhances the credibility and trustworthiness of the crypto industry, attracting more mainstream adoption. What’s Next? The Financial Regulator Decision and Potential Impacts All eyes are now on the impending financial regulator decision from the FSC. Chairman Kim Byoung-hwan’s announcement indicates that a resolution is imminent. The nature of the sanctions remains undisclosed, but they could range from fines and operational restrictions to more severe penalties depending on the gravity of the compliance failures. The potential impacts of these sanctions are multifaceted: Upbit’s Operations: Sanctions could disrupt Upbit’s operations, potentially affecting its trading volumes and market share in South Korea. Market Confidence: The decision will likely influence investor confidence in Upbit and the broader South Korean crypto market. Strict sanctions could be interpreted as a sign of regulatory seriousness, while lenient penalties might be seen as insufficient. Industry-Wide Implications: Other crypto exchanges in South Korea and globally will be closely watching the outcome. This case serves as a stark reminder of the importance of regulatory compliance in the crypto space. Future of Crypto Regulation: The FSC’s decision could set a precedent for future regulatory actions against crypto exchanges in South Korea and potentially inspire similar measures in other jurisdictions. Navigating the Evolving Crypto Regulatory Landscape For cryptocurrency users and businesses, the Upbit situation provides crucial lessons: Prioritize Compliance: Crypto exchanges must invest in robust KYC/AML compliance programs and continuously adapt to evolving regulatory requirements. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments in your jurisdiction and understand your obligations. Choose Compliant Platforms: When selecting a crypto exchange, prioritize platforms with a strong track record of regulatory compliance and transparency. Engage with Regulators: Proactive dialogue and collaboration with regulators can help shape constructive and effective crypto regulations. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Crypto in South Korea The upcoming decision on Upbit sanctions represents a critical moment for the cryptocurrency industry in South Korea. It underscores the growing emphasis on regulatory compliance and investor protection in the digital asset space. As the FSC prepares to announce its verdict, the crypto world waits with bated breath, understanding that this decision could have far-reaching consequences for the future of crypto regulation and the operation of exchanges worldwide. The message is clear: in the evolving landscape of digital finance, compliance is not optional—it’s imperative.

Today, all eyes are on WTI oil as prices dramatically recover, breaching the $71 mark. This surge isn’t due to typical market fluctuations, but rather a significant event: supply disruptions originating from the crucial Caspian region . For crypto investors watching broader economic trends, understanding these energy market movements is vital. Let’s dive into what’s causing this spike and what it means for the global economy. Why is WTI Oil Price Surging? Unpacking the Caspian Supply Disruptions The primary driver behind the recent WTI oil price increase is the reported attack on a key oil pipeline pumping station in the Caspian region . Specifically, the Kropotkinskaya station in Russia’s Krasnodar region, operated by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, was struck by drones. This incident has directly impacted oil flows from Kazakhstan, a major producer, to global markets. Western producers rely on this route, and the disruption is causing ripples across the energy market . Drone Attack Impact: The attack on the Kropotkinskaya pumping station has physically slowed down the transportation of crude oil . Supply Chain Bottleneck: Reduced flows from Kazakhstan directly translate to tighter global crude oil supplies. Market Reaction: As supply concerns escalate, the price of WTI oil , a global benchmark, naturally increases due to anticipated scarcity. Giovanni Staunovo, a UBS analyst, highlighted the growing concern, stating, “Although those drone attacks so far had limited disruption impacts on Russian crude oil exports, the rising frequency of those attacks is a concern that at some point it triggers some supply risks.” This sentiment underscores the market’s sensitivity to geopolitical instability and its potential impact on energy market stability. Geopolitical Tensions and WTI: A Delicate Balancing Act Beyond the immediate impact of the Caspian pipeline incident, broader geopolitical factors are at play. The Russia-Ukraine war and escalating trade tensions are casting shadows over the WTI oil market. Ceasefire Talks: A Double-Edged Sword? Potential ceasefire talks between Moscow and Kyiv introduce a complex dynamic. While a ceasefire could de-escalate tensions, it might also lead to: Easing of Sanctions: Reduced sanctions on Russia could potentially increase global oil supplies, which might exert downward pressure on the WTI oil price . Increased Supply: Resumption of normal oil production and export activities could flood the market, again potentially lowering prices. Conversely, the absence of a ceasefire keeps supply concerns elevated, potentially supporting higher WTI oil prices in the long run. Trade War Threats: A Looming Economic Headwind? The specter of a global trade war, particularly with the US considering reciprocal tariffs, adds another layer of uncertainty. Trade wars can: Slow Global Growth: Tariffs and trade barriers can hinder economic activity, reducing overall demand for crude oil . Demand Reduction: Lower global demand typically translates to decreased demand for WTI oil and other energy commodities, potentially leading to price declines. Understanding WTI Oil: FAQs for Crypto-Savvy Investors For those in the crypto space, understanding traditional markets like WTI oil is increasingly important. Here are some frequently asked questions to bring you up to speed: Question Answer What exactly is WTI oil ? WTI stands for West Texas Intermediate. It’s a high-grade, light, sweet crude oil benchmark, prized for its refining ease. Sourced in the US and distributed via Cushing, Oklahoma, “The Pipeline Crossroads of the World”. What drives the crude oil price of WTI? Basic economics: supply and demand. Global economic growth boosts demand, while recessions dampen it. Geopolitical events, wars, and OPEC decisions significantly impact supply. The US Dollar’s strength also plays a role, as oil is USD-denominated. How do inventory reports affect the energy market and WTI oil price ? Weekly inventory data from the API and EIA reveals supply and demand shifts. Declining inventories suggest higher demand, pushing prices up. Rising inventories indicate oversupply, potentially lowering prices. EIA data is considered more authoritative. What’s OPEC’s influence on the WTI oil price ? OPEC, and OPEC+ (including Russia), control a significant portion of global oil production. Their decisions on production quotas directly impact supply. Cuts tighten supply, raising prices; increases loosen supply, lowering prices. Navigating the Energy Market Landscape The recovery of WTI oil above $71, fueled by supply disruptions in the Caspian region , highlights the interconnectedness of global markets. From drone attacks on pipelines to geopolitical tensions and trade war threats, a multitude of factors are influencing the crude oil price and the broader energy market . For investors, whether in crypto or traditional assets, staying informed about these dynamics is crucial for making sound decisions in an increasingly volatile world.

This statement, delivered on Monday, February 18, 2025, underscores the critical juncture at which European security finds itself, particularly in the context of the ongoing Ukraine crisis . For cryptocurrency investors and market watchers, understanding these geopolitical shifts is paramount as they significantly influence risk sentiment and asset valuations, including gold price and the broader cryptocurrency impact . Starmer’s Stark Assessment of European Security Starmer’s comments, as reported by Reuters, highlight a pressing need for a robust security framework to ensure lasting peace in the region. His key assertions paint a clear picture of the challenges and the proposed solutions: US Security Guarantee is Vital: Starmer emphasized that a “US backstop” is not just preferred, but absolutely necessary to effectively deter Russia from future aggression against Ukraine. This underlines the indispensable role of the United States in maintaining European security and stability. Existential Threat to Europe: The Prime Minister didn’t mince words, stating unequivocally that “The future of Ukraine is an existential issue for Europe.” This powerful statement elevates the Ukraine crisis beyond a regional conflict, framing it as a matter of survival and fundamental importance for the entire European continent. Europe Must Share the Burden: While acknowledging the necessity of US involvement, Starmer also called for greater European responsibility, stating, “It is pressing that they now share the burden. Europe must play its role.” This call to action urges European nations to step up their contributions to collective security. These points collectively paint a picture of a precarious situation where the stakes are incredibly high, not just for Ukraine, but for the entire fabric of European security . Market Reaction: Gold Price and Risk Sentiment Amidst these geopolitical tensions, financial markets are closely monitoring the developments. As of the press time, the gold price showed a slight uptick, trading at $2,899, up 0.07% on the day. This marginal increase can be interpreted as a subtle indicator of prevailing risk sentiment . To better understand how such events influence market dynamics, it’s crucial to grasp the concepts of “risk-on” and “risk-off” sentiment. Understanding Risk Sentiment: Risk-On vs. Risk-Off In financial markets, the terms “risk-on” and “risk-off” are fundamental in gauging investor behavior and market trends. Here’s a breakdown: Sentiment Investor Behavior Market Outlook Risk-On Optimistic, willing to invest in riskier assets Positive future outlook, growth anticipated Risk-Off Cautious, preferring safer assets Worried about future, uncertainty prevails During periods of risk-on sentiment , investors are more inclined to seek higher returns, often investing in assets perceived as riskier but with greater growth potential. Conversely, in a risk-off environment , the priority shifts to capital preservation, leading investors towards safer, more stable assets. Assets to Watch: Gauging Risk Sentiment Certain asset classes are particularly sensitive to shifts in risk sentiment , making them valuable indicators for traders and investors: Risk-On Assets: Stock Markets: Generally rise as investors anticipate economic growth. Commodities (ex-Gold): Most commodities gain value due to positive growth forecasts. Commodity Currencies: Currencies of commodity-exporting nations strengthen. Examples include AUD, CAD, NZD. Cryptocurrencies: Tend to rise as part of risk assets, reflecting speculative investment. Risk-Off Assets: Bonds (Government): Especially major government bonds, increase in demand as safe havens. Gold: Often shines as a safe-haven asset during uncertainty. Safe-Haven Currencies: Currencies like JPY, CHF, and USD strengthen. Currency Dynamics in Risk-On and Risk-Off Markets Understanding which currencies strengthen under different risk sentiment scenarios is crucial for Forex traders and those monitoring global financial flows. Risk-On Currencies These currencies are typically tied to economies that benefit from global growth and commodity demand: Australian Dollar (AUD) Canadian Dollar (CAD) New Zealand Dollar (NZD) Minor FX: Ruble (RUB), South African Rand (ZAR) These economies are heavily reliant on commodity exports, and increased global economic activity drives demand and prices for these commodities, thus strengthening their currencies. Risk-Off Currencies These currencies are sought after for their stability and safety during times of market uncertainty: US Dollar (USD): The world’s reserve currency, bolstered by demand for US government debt in crises. Japanese Yen (JPY): Japanese government bonds are largely held domestically, providing stability even in crises. Swiss Franc (CHF): Swiss banking laws and capital protection attract investors seeking safety. Implications for Cryptocurrency Investors For those invested in or watching the cryptocurrency market , Starmer’s warning and the broader Ukraine crisis have significant implications. Geopolitical instability often fuels risk-off sentiment , which can impact cryptocurrency impact in complex ways. While cryptocurrencies are sometimes seen as alternative safe havens, particularly Bitcoin, their behavior in times of geopolitical stress can be varied. Initially, a flight to safety might see investors move towards traditional safe havens like gold and the US dollar. However, prolonged uncertainty and potential financial system disruptions could also increase interest in decentralized assets like cryptocurrencies as a hedge against traditional financial risks. Currently, the slight uptick in gold price alongside Starmer’s comments suggests a cautious market mood. Investors are likely monitoring the Ukraine crisis and its potential escalation, which could further drive risk-off sentiment . For cryptocurrency holders, this means being prepared for potential volatility and understanding that the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape plays a crucial role in market movements. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty in European Security and Crypto Markets Keir Starmer’s statement serves as a critical reminder of the intertwined nature of global politics and financial markets. The Ukraine crisis is not just a regional issue; it’s a matter of European security with far-reaching consequences for global risk sentiment and asset valuations. For cryptocurrency investors, staying informed about these geopolitical developments and understanding their potential cryptocurrency impact is essential. Monitoring indicators like gold price and risk-off/risk-on shifts can provide valuable insights for navigating these uncertain times. The need for a “US backstop” and the call for greater European burden-sharing underscore the urgency and complexity of the situation, demanding vigilance and strategic awareness from all market participants.

All eyes are on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) as they gear up for their first monetary policy decision of 2025. Whispers in the market strongly suggest a potential shift in strategy – a cut in interest rates. But what does this mean for the Australian Dollar, the broader economy, and even your crypto portfolio? Let’s dive deep into the anticipated RBA interest rate decision and what it could unleash. Why is the RBA Considering an Interest Rate Cut Now? For months, the RBA has held the Official Cash Rate (OCR) steady at 4.35%, battling stubbornly high inflation. However, the latest economic indicators are painting a slightly different picture. Inflation pressures in Australia appear to be easing, prompting speculation about a change in the RBA’s stance. Let’s break down the key factors influencing this potential shift: Easing Inflation: The most recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) data revealed a slower-than-expected rise in inflation during the final quarter of 2024. The RBA’s preferred measure, the Trimmed Mean CPI, also showed a moderation, hinting that previous rate hikes might be starting to bite. Economic Growth Concerns: While inflation remained elevated, the Australian economy has shown signs of sluggish growth. Persistent high interest rates can put a strain on households and businesses, potentially further dampening economic activity. A rate cut could be seen as a measure to inject some life back into the economy. Global Economic Uncertainty: The global economic landscape remains uncertain, with potential headwinds from international trade tensions and varying growth trajectories across major economies. A proactive move by the RBA could be aimed at safeguarding the Australian economy against external shocks. Despite these factors, it’s not a straightforward decision. Solid employment growth presents a counter-argument against aggressive rate cuts. The robust job market, with annual employment growth strengthening to 3.1% in December, suggests the economy isn’t in dire straits. This complexity adds an element of suspense to the upcoming RBA announcement. Decoding the Expected RBA Interest Rate Decision: 25 bps Cut on the Horizon? Market consensus strongly leans towards a 25 basis points (bps) cut to the OCR. This expectation is built upon: Inflation Data: As mentioned, the latest CPI figures provided a crucial signal that inflation might be on a downward trajectory. The Trimmed Mean CPI coming in below expectations was a significant factor. RBA’s Own Signals: Recent statements from the RBA, particularly the minutes from previous meetings, suggest a subtle shift in tone. While initially emphasizing upside risks to inflation, the RBA has more recently expressed “some confidence” that inflation is moving towards their 2-3% target range. Market Pricing: Financial markets have already priced in a high probability of a 25 bps cut, indicating a strong conviction among investors and analysts. However, it’s crucial to remember that central bank decisions are never guaranteed. The RBA could still opt to hold rates steady, or even surprise the market with a larger 50 bps cut if they are deeply concerned about economic slowdown. The actual statement accompanying the decision will be just as important as the rate move itself, offering crucial clues about the RBA’s future policy path. How Will an AUD Interest Rate Cut Impact the Australian Dollar? A cut in interest rates generally tends to weaken a currency. Therefore, if the RBA delivers the expected 25 bps interest rate cut, the Australian Dollar (AUD) could face selling pressure. However, the extent of the AUD’s weakness will depend on several factors: Magnitude of the Cut: A 25 bps cut is largely priced in. A surprise 50 bps cut would likely trigger a more significant AUD sell-off. Forward Guidance: The RBA’s statement and Governor Bullock’s press conference will be critical. If the RBA signals further rate cuts are likely in the near future (a dovish stance), the AUD could weaken considerably. Conversely, if they emphasize a cautious approach to easing, suggesting spaced-out cuts (a hawkish cut), the AUD’s downside might be limited, or it could even see a temporary bounce. Global Context: The performance of the US Dollar (USD) and overall market sentiment will also play a role. If the USD remains weak, as suggested by recent market trends influenced by US fiscal policy and Federal Reserve expectations, the AUD/USD pair might see limited downside even with an RBA rate cut. Valeria Bednarik, Chief Analyst at Bitcoin World, offers a technical perspective on the AUD/USD pair: “The AUD/USD pair has shown bullish momentum, reaching its highest level since mid-December. Technically, there’s scope for further gains towards the 0.6470 region if the pair can overcome immediate resistance at 0.6373. However, a dovish RBA outcome could trigger a slide below 0.6300, potentially exposing the 0.6230 zone.” What are the Broader Economic Implications of RBA’s Decision? Beyond the immediate impact on the Australian Dollar, the RBA’s interest rate decision has wider implications for the Australian economy: Borrowing Costs: A rate cut would reduce borrowing costs for households and businesses, potentially stimulating spending and investment. This could provide a welcome boost to economic growth. Housing Market: Lower interest rates can fuel demand in the housing market, potentially leading to increased property prices. This can be a double-edged sword, offering wealth effects for homeowners but also raising concerns about housing affordability. Inflation Expectations: The RBA needs to carefully manage inflation expectations. While aiming to ease current pressures, they must avoid signaling a premature victory over inflation, which could lead to a resurgence in price increases down the line. Savings and Investments: Lower interest rates can reduce returns on savings accounts and fixed-income investments, potentially encouraging savers to seek higher-yielding assets, including riskier investments. Navigating the Forex Market After the RBA Rate Cut: Key Strategies For Forex traders, the RBA interest rate decision presents both opportunities and risks. Here are some key strategies to consider: AUD/USD Trading: Monitor the AUD/USD pair closely around the announcement. A dovish RBA outcome could present short-selling opportunities, while a hawkish cut might offer long opportunities if the pair breaks above resistance levels. Cross-Currency Pairs: Consider trading AUD against other currencies, such as the Japanese Yen (JPY) or the Euro (EUR). The relative monetary policy stances of these central banks compared to the RBA will be crucial in determining cross-currency movements. Risk Management: Volatility is likely to spike around the RBA announcement. Employ robust risk management techniques, including stop-loss orders and appropriate position sizing, to protect your capital. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest news and analysis from reputable sources like Bitcoin World to stay ahead of market developments and refine your trading strategies. RBA FAQs: Understanding the Basics Let’s address some frequently asked questions about the RBA and its influence: What is the Reserve Bank of Australia and how does it influence the Australian Dollar? The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is Australia’s central bank. It sets interest rates and manages monetary policy to maintain price stability (inflation between 2-3%) and contribute to the stability of the currency, full employment, and economic prosperity. Higher interest rates generally strengthen the AUD, while lower rates tend to weaken it. How does inflation data impact the value of the Australian Dollar? Moderately higher inflation can lead central banks like the RBA to raise interest rates to control prices. Higher rates attract foreign investment, increasing demand for the AUD and thus its value. Conversely, very low inflation or deflation can signal economic weakness and potentially lead to rate cuts, weakening the AUD. How does economic data influence the value of the Australian Dollar? Strong economic data (e.g., GDP growth, strong employment, positive PMIs) suggests a healthy economy, attracting investment and potentially leading to higher interest rates by the RBA. This generally strengthens the AUD. Weak economic data can have the opposite effect. What is Quantitative Easing (QE) and how does it affect the Australian Dollar? Quantitative Easing (QE) is an unconventional monetary policy tool used in crises. The RBA prints AUD to buy assets (usually government bonds) to inject liquidity into the financial system. QE typically weakens the AUD as it increases the supply of the currency. What is Quantitative tightening (QT) and how does it affect the Australian Dollar? Quantitative Tightening (QT) is the reverse of QE. The RBA reduces its balance sheet by stopping asset purchases and allowing bonds to mature without reinvesting. QT is usually implemented during economic recovery to combat inflation and is considered bullish for the AUD as it reduces currency supply. Economic Indicator: RBA Trimmed Mean CPI (QoQ) The Trimmed Mean CPI is a key inflation gauge for the RBA. It measures the change in prices of a basket of goods and services, excluding the most volatile components to provide a clearer picture of underlying inflation trends. A higher reading is generally AUD bullish, suggesting potential rate hikes, while a lower reading is AUD bearish, potentially leading to rate cuts. Last Release: Wed Jan 29, 2025 00:30 Frequency: Quarterly Actual: 0.5% Consensus: 0.6% Previous: 0.8% Source: Australian Bureau of Statistics Why it matters to traders? The CPI data is crucial for traders as it directly influences RBA policy decisions and the AUD’s valuation. Rising consumer prices can lead to RBA rate hikes, making the AUD more attractive to investors. Conclusion: Brace for Potential Australian Dollar Volatility The upcoming RBA interest rate decision is a crucial event for the Australian Dollar and the broader financial markets. While a 25 bps cut is widely anticipated due to easing inflation pressures, the RBA’s forward guidance and any surprises in the announcement will be key drivers of market reaction. Traders should prepare for potential volatility in the AUD and adjust their strategies accordingly. Keep a close watch on the RBA’s statement and Governor Bullock’s press conference for vital clues about the future path of Australian monetary policy and its impact on the Forex landscape.

Today’s spotlight is on China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), and its latest fixing of the USD/CNY reference rate . This seemingly minor adjustment carries significant weight, influencing not just the Chinese Yuan (CNY) but potentially broader market sentiment. Let’s dive into what this latest PBOC decision means and why it matters in the context of the global financial landscape. What is the Significance of the PBOC’s USD/CNY Reference Rate Setting? The PBOC , as China’s central bank , plays a pivotal role in managing the nation’s currency, the Chinese Yuan . One of its key tools is setting the daily USD/CNY reference rate . This rate, announced each morning, dictates the central parity around which the Yuan can trade against the US dollar in the onshore market. Think of it as an anchor for the day’s trading, influencing market expectations and currency movements. On Tuesday, the PBOC set the USD/CNY reference rate at 7.1697, a slight adjustment from the previous fix of 7.1702. While seemingly a small change, these daily adjustments are closely watched by traders and economists globally. Why? Signal of Intent: The reference rate provides a signal of the PBOC’s stance on the Yuan’s value. A stronger fix (lower USD/CNY rate) can indicate a desire to support the Yuan, while a weaker fix (higher USD/CNY rate) might suggest a more neutral or easing stance. Market Guidance: It helps guide market expectations for the Yuan’s daily trading range. Although the onshore Yuan can fluctuate within a permitted band around this rate, the fix acts as a powerful psychological and practical benchmark. Economic Stability: By managing the USD/CNY reference rate , the PBOC aims to maintain exchange rate stability, a key objective for economic stability in China. PBOC FAQs: Decoding China’s Central Bank Actions To better understand the context of this rate setting, let’s address some frequently asked questions about the PBOC and its operations: Question Answer What does the People’s Bank of China do? The primary goals of the PBOC are to maintain price stability, including exchange rate stability, and to foster economic growth. It also focuses on financial reforms and market development. Who controls the PBOC? The PBOC is state-owned and thus not fully autonomous. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) plays a significant role in its management and direction. What policy tools does the PBOC use? Unlike many Western central banks, the PBOC employs a broad range of tools, including: Seven-day Reverse Repo Rate (RRR) Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF) Foreign exchange interventions Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR) Loan Prime Rate (LPR) – China’s benchmark interest rate Are private banks allowed in China? Yes, China has a limited number of private banks, including digital lenders like WeBank and MYbank, backed by major tech companies. Why This Matters for the Chinese Yuan (CNY) and Beyond The subtle shift in the USD/CNY reference rate to 7.1697 reflects the PBOC’s ongoing management of the Chinese Yuan . In comparison to Reuters’ estimates of 7.2538, the set rate is notably stronger, suggesting a controlled approach to the Yuan’s valuation. This is particularly relevant given global economic uncertainties and currency fluctuations. For cryptocurrency investors, monitoring these traditional financial indicators is vital. Currency strength and stability, especially for major economies like China, can influence broader market sentiment and risk appetite. A stable or strengthening Chinese Yuan , guided by the PBOC’s measured approach to the USD/CNY reference rate , can contribute to a more predictable global financial environment, which indirectly impacts the cryptocurrency markets as well. Actionable Insights Stay Informed: Keep an eye on daily USD/CNY reference rate fixings by the PBOC as indicators of potential shifts in China’s currency policy. Understand the Tools: Familiarize yourself with the PBOC’s policy tools beyond just interest rates, such as the RRR and MLF, to grasp their broader influence. Global Context: Recognize that China’s central bank actions, including USD/CNY reference rate settings, are part of a complex global economic interplay that can have ripple effects across all markets, including crypto. In Conclusion: The PBOC’s Steady Hand on the Yuan The PBOC’s latest USD/CNY reference rate adjustment, though incremental, is a testament to its active management of the Chinese Yuan . By carefully setting this daily benchmark, China’s central bank aims to foster stability and guide market expectations. For those navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, understanding these traditional financial mechanisms offers valuable context and a broader perspective on global economic currents. The PBOC’s actions, while focused on the Chinese Yuan , resonate throughout the financial world, reminding us of the interconnectedness of global markets.

40523001,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=130140,1739932188,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Encouraging Boost: Xi Jinping’s Bold Move to Revive China’s Private Sector,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/xi-jinping-boost-private-sector/,"In a potentially powerful move that has global markets buzzing, China’s President Xi Jinping has signaled a significant shift in Beijing’s economic strategy. The focus? Injecting fresh vigor into the nation’s long-underestimated private sector. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and forex traders closely monitoring global economic shifts, this development carries considerable weight, particularly for pairs like AUD/USD. Let’s dive into what this means and why it matters. Why is China’s Private Sector Boost a Game Changer? For years, China’s private sector, despite being a massive engine of growth, has often operated under the shadow of state-owned enterprises and regulatory uncertainties. President Xi’s recent meeting with prominent entrepreneurs, including Alibaba’s Jack Ma, suggests a notable change in approach. The key message is clear: Beijing is now actively championing the private sector as crucial for economic revival. This is not just rhetoric; it’s a strategic pivot with potentially far-reaching consequences. Xi Jinping’s statements emphasized the need to: Eliminate Obstacles: Resolutely remove barriers hindering equal access to production resources and fair market competition. This signals a commitment to leveling the playing field for private businesses. Open Infrastructure: Continue promoting fair access to infrastructure sectors for all types of businesses. This move could unlock significant growth opportunities for private companies in crucial industries. Ease Financing: Make substantial efforts to resolve the persistent problem of difficult and expensive financing for private enterprises. Access to capital is the lifeblood of business growth, and this pledge addresses a major pain point. How Does This Impact the Australian Dollar (AUD/USD)? The ripple effects of China’s economic policies are felt globally, and the Australian Dollar (AUD) is particularly sensitive to China’s economic health. Why? Australia’s economy is heavily intertwined with China, its largest trading partner. A robust Chinese economy typically translates to increased demand for Australian exports, especially commodities like iron ore. Let’s break down the key connections: China Economy Revive and the Australian Dollar A revitalized China economy revive , fueled by a stronger private sector, implies increased economic activity. This generally leads to: Higher Demand for Australian Exports: As China’s economy expands, so does its need for raw materials and resources, a significant portion of which comes from Australia. Positive Impact on AUD: Increased demand for Australian goods boosts the Australian Dollar . Think of it as simple supply and demand – more demand for AUD pushes its value up. AUD/USD Dynamics: A stronger AUD relative to the US Dollar can lead to an upward movement in the AUD/USD exchange rate. Understanding the AUD/USD Relationship in Detail To truly grasp the potential impact, let’s revisit the factors driving the Australian Dollar , as highlighted in the original article’s FAQs: Factor Impact on AUD RBA Interest Rates Higher rates generally support AUD; lower rates weaken AUD. Iron Ore Prices Higher prices boost AUD; lower prices weaken AUD. China Economy Health Stronger economy strengthens AUD; weaker economy weakens AUD. Australian Inflation & Growth Stronger economy and controlled inflation support AUD. Trade Balance Positive balance strengthens AUD; negative balance weakens AUD. Market Sentiment (Risk-on/Risk-off) Risk-on sentiment is positive for AUD; risk-off is negative. As you can see, the health of the China economy is a major determinant of the Australian Dollar ‘s value. Xi Jinping’s commitment to bolstering the private sector directly addresses this factor. If these policies translate into tangible economic improvements in China, we could see sustained positive pressure on the AUD. Market Reaction and What to Watch For The initial market reaction, as noted in the original article, showed AUD/USD slightly down. However, this could be a temporary blip or influenced by other factors, such as repositioning ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) decisions. Moving forward, keep a close eye on: Chinese Economic Data: Watch for upcoming economic indicators from China. Improvements in GDP growth, industrial production, and consumer spending will be key signals that the private sector boost is gaining traction. Iron Ore Prices: Monitor iron ore prices, as they directly reflect Chinese demand and impact the AUD. RBA Policy: The RBA’s monetary policy decisions and statements will continue to play a crucial role in AUD valuation. However, a stronger Chinese economy could give the RBA more flexibility. Global Market Sentiment: Overall risk appetite in global markets will also influence AUD/USD. Positive sentiment tends to favor the AUD as a risk-on currency. Actionable Insights for Traders For traders focusing on AUD/USD and related currency pairs, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed on China: Make tracking Chinese economic news a priority. Policy announcements, economic data releases, and geopolitical developments in China can all significantly impact the AUD. Monitor Commodity Prices: Keep a close watch on iron ore and other key Australian commodity exports. Price movements can provide early signals of shifts in Chinese demand and AUD direction. Combine Fundamental and Technical Analysis: Use fundamental analysis to assess the long-term impact of China’s policy shift and technical analysis to identify potential entry and exit points for trades. Manage Risk: As always, practice sound risk management. Currency markets can be volatile, and it’s crucial to manage your exposure appropriately. Conclusion: A Promising Sign for the Australian Dollar? President Xi Jinping’s call to boost China private sector is a potentially pivotal development for the global economy and particularly for the Australian Dollar . While the full impact will unfold over time, the initial signals are encouraging . A thriving Chinese private sector could be a significant tailwind for the AUD, supporting higher commodity prices and increased demand for Australian exports. For traders and investors, staying attuned to developments in China and their impact on the AUD/USD pair is now more crucial than ever.

Experts suggest that this dwindling ETH supply could indicate an impending ‘supply shock,’ potentially fuelling a significant rally in the cryptocurrency. Ethereum Reserves At 9-Year Low Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, continues to trade within the mid-$2,000 range, sitting at $2,721 at the time of writing. Unlike Bitcoin (BTC), ETH has had a relatively quiet 2024, struggling to break past its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878, recorded in November 2021. Related Reading: Ethereum Appears ‘Bottomed Out,’ Analyst Predicts A Rally Is Near This lackluster price action has contributed to waning investor confidence in ETH. However, the digital asset recently managed to defend the critical $2,380-$2,460 demand zone, rekindling bullish hopes for a potential breakout above the stubborn $3,000 resistance level. More notably, ETH reserves on centralized exchanges continue to plummet, which could lead to a supply shock – a scenario where demand for the asset surpasses its liquid supply. If this materializes, ETH may experience rapid price appreciation. For the uninitiated, a supply shock in the crypto industry occurs when the demand for the underlying digital asset exceeds its liquid supply. As a result, the underlying asset – ETH, in this case – may experience sharp price appreciation in a short time. As of today, ETH reserves on centralized crypto exchanges have fallen to 18.95 million, a level last seen in July 2016. Notably, ETH was trading at $14 at the time. Recent analysis from seasoned crypto analyst Crypto Buddha suggests that ETH may be on the verge of a major price move. The analyst highlights how ETH has broken through a diagonal resistance level, signalling a potential bullish breakout. Furthermore, Bitcoin (BTC) is exhibiting similar price behavior. A successful BTC breakout could spark a broader crypto market rally, driving significant gains across various digital assets. Crypto Buddha noted: Bitcoin‘s price action is following a similar pattern with a triangular convergence, raising the question of whether it can break through successfully like Ethereum. Since the low of $91,000, Bitcoin has been consolidating for 10 days. The market is at a crucial juncture, and it’s time to pick a direction. Will ETH Investors Finally Have Their Time? Unlike competitors such as Solana (SOL), SUI, and XRP, which have all seen significant price appreciation over the past year, ETH has struggled to capitalize on bullish momentum. Bearish sentiment surrounding ETH has been on unprecedented levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Positioned For A ‘Major Move Upward’ In 2025, Analyst Forecasts However, analysts are confident that ETH may soon surprise the market. Recent analysis by Titan of Crypto emphasizes that ETH may soon enter its ‘most hated rally,’ leading to major price appreciation. That said, concerns about the Ethereum Foundation selling copious amounts of ETH continue to haunt the holders. At press time, ETH trades at $2,721, down 4.7% in the past 24 hours.

The Australian Dollar (AUD) is experiencing a significant downturn as all eyes turn to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and their impending policy decision. Will the RBA pull the trigger on an interest rate cut ? The markets are on tenterhooks, and the Aussie Dollar is reflecting this pre-decision jitters. Let’s dive deep into what’s driving this market movement and what you should be watching. Why is the Australian Dollar (AUD) Weakening Ahead of the RBA Decision? The primary driver behind the Australian Dollar’s current depreciation is the widespread expectation that the RBA will announce a cut to its Official Cash Rate (OCR) on Tuesday. Traders are exercising caution, pulling back on AUD positions as they anticipate a potential reduction in the Aussie Dollar’s yield appeal. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors at play: Anticipated Interest Rate Cut: The market consensus points towards a 25 basis point cut, bringing the OCR down to 4.10%. This would be the first such cut in four years, signaling a potential shift in the RBA’s monetary policy. Inflation Concerns: While inflation is showing signs of easing in Australia, the trimmed mean inflation remains above the RBA’s target range of 2%-3%. This delicate balance between controlling inflation and stimulating economic growth adds complexity to the RBA’s decision-making. US Dollar Strength: Simultaneously, the US Dollar (USD) is gaining momentum, fueled by improved Treasury yields. This strengthens the USD against other currencies, including the AUD, further contributing to the AUD/USD pair’s downward pressure. In essence, it’s a perfect storm of factors weighing on the Australian Dollar . The anticipation of a domestic interest rate cut combined with a strengthening US Dollar is creating a bearish environment for the Aussie. Decoding the RBA Decision: Will it be a Rate Cut? The big question on everyone’s mind is: will the RBA actually cut rates? Recent economic data suggests a leaning towards a rate cut, but the RBA’s stance could be more nuanced. Let’s examine the data points influencing the expected RBA decision : Economic Indicator Data Implication for RBA December Consumer Price Index (CPI) Rose less than forecast Signals easing price pressures, supporting a rate cut Trimmed Mean CPI (Quarterly) 0.5% (below 0.6% expected) Further indication of moderating inflation Trimmed Mean CPI (Annualized) 3.2% (down from 3.5%) Inflation still above target range, potentially tempering aggressive rate cuts While the data shows inflation easing, it’s crucial to remember that the trimmed mean CPI is still above the RBA’s target band. This might lead the RBA to adopt a cautious approach, even if they proceed with a 25 bps cut. The accompanying policy statement will be critical in deciphering the RBA’s future intentions. US Dollar (USD) Ascends as Treasury Yields Improve Adding another layer to the AUD/USD dynamic is the resurgence of the US Dollar. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is climbing higher, breaking a three-session losing streak. This strength is attributed to improved US Treasury yields, making USD-denominated assets more attractive to investors. Key factors influencing the USD’s strength include: Rising Treasury Yields: Yields on 2-year and 10-year US Treasury bonds have risen to 4.26% and 4.50% respectively, indicating increased investor demand for US government debt. Hawkish Fed Stance: Federal Reserve officials, including Governor Michelle Bowman and Governor Christopher Waller, have emphasized the need for continued vigilance on inflation. Governor Bowman highlighted concerns about rising asset prices potentially hindering inflation progress, while Governor Waller stressed a data-driven approach and cautioned against policy uncertainty. Solid US Economic Growth: Despite a weaker-than-expected retail sales report in January, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has pointed to the strength of the US job market and solid economic growth, suggesting no urgency to cut US interest rates. The contrasting monetary policy stances – the potential for RBA rate cuts versus the Fed’s cautious approach – are widening the interest rate differential between Australia and the US, further bolstering the US Dollar at the expense of the Australian Dollar. Technical Outlook for AUD/USD: Key Levels to Watch From a technical perspective, the AUD/USD pair is currently trading around 0.6340. Let’s analyze the key technical levels that traders should monitor: Ascending Channel: The pair is trending upwards within an ascending channel, indicating an underlying bullish bias despite the recent pullback. Relative Strength Index (RSI): The 14-day RSI remains above 50, further supporting a bullish outlook in the medium term. Resistance Levels: Upper boundary of the ascending channel: 0.6390 Psychological resistance: 0.6400 Support Levels: 9-day EMA: 0.6316 14-day EMA: 0.6300 Lower boundary of the ascending channel: 0.6280 Traders should watch for a potential breakout above the ascending channel for further upside in AUD/USD . Conversely, a break below the 9-day EMA could signal further weakness towards the lower support levels.

Decoding Australian Dollar (AUD) Drivers: FAQs Want to understand the Australian Dollar better? Here are answers to some frequently asked questions: What key factors drive the Australian Dollar? RBA Interest Rates: Interest rate decisions by the Reserve Bank of Australia are a primary driver. Higher rates typically support the AUD. Iron Ore Prices: As a major export, iron ore prices significantly impact the Australian economy and the AUD. Chinese Economy Health: China is Australia’s largest trading partner, so Chinese economic performance heavily influences AUD demand. Australian Inflation and Growth: Domestic inflation levels, economic growth rates, and the trade balance are crucial fundamental factors. Market Sentiment: Global risk sentiment (risk-on/risk-off) affects the AUD, with risk-on generally being positive for the currency. How do the decisions of the Reserve Bank of Australia impact the Australian Dollar? The RBA uses interest rate adjustments as its primary tool to manage inflation and influence the economy. By raising or lowering rates, the RBA impacts borrowing costs, investment flows, and ultimately, the value of the Australian Dollar . Higher rates tend to attract foreign investment, increasing demand for the AUD and vice versa. Quantitative easing (QE) and tightening are also used, with QE being AUD-negative and tightening AUD-positive. How does the health of the Chinese Economy impact the Australian Dollar? China’s robust economic growth translates to increased demand for Australian raw materials, goods, and services. This heightened demand boosts the Australian Dollar . Conversely, a slowdown in the Chinese economy can dampen demand, weakening the AUD. Chinese economic data releases often trigger direct reactions in the AUD/USD pair. How does the price of Iron Ore impact the Australian Dollar? Iron ore, Australia’s top export, is a significant revenue generator. Rising iron ore prices increase demand for the Australian Dollar as more currency is needed to purchase this commodity. This positive correlation means higher iron ore prices generally lead to a stronger AUD, and vice versa. A positive trade balance, often boosted by strong iron ore exports, further supports the AUD. How does the Trade Balance impact the Australian Dollar? A positive Trade Balance, where exports exceed imports, indicates strong international demand for Australian goods and services. This surplus demand strengthens the Australian Dollar . Conversely, a negative Trade Balance can weaken the AUD. A healthy Trade Balance reflects a competitive export sector and is generally seen as a positive fundamental factor for the currency. Conclusion: Navigating the Australian Dollar Volatility The Australian Dollar is currently navigating a period of heightened volatility as the market anticipates the RBA’s interest rate cut decision . The confluence of domestic monetary policy expectations and global factors, particularly the strengthening US Dollar , is creating downward pressure on the Aussie. Traders should closely monitor the RBA’s announcement and accompanying statement for clues about future policy direction. Keep an eye on key technical levels for potential trading opportunities in the AUD/USD pair. The coming days promise to be crucial for the direction of the Australian Dollar in the Forex market.

While the crypto market keeps you on your toes, traditional currencies are also making waves. The USD/INR pair is currently experiencing a significant surge, grabbing attention in the forex market. What’s fueling this upward momentum, and what does it mean for the Indian Rupee? Let’s dive into the key factors driving this currency dynamic. Why is USD/INR Surging? Decoding the Drivers The USD/INR exchange rate is currently witnessing an upside extension, primarily driven by two major forces: Foreign Fund Outflows : India is experiencing significant foreign fund outflows , as Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) are pulling their investments out of domestic equities. This exodus of capital weakens demand for the Indian Rupee, pushing the USD/INR pair higher. US Dollar Demand : Simultaneously, the US Dollar is gaining strength in the global market. This increased US Dollar demand further exacerbates the pressure on the Indian Rupee, contributing to the upward trajectory of USD/INR. These dual pressures are creating a perfect storm for the Indian Rupee, leading to its depreciation against the US Dollar. RBI Intervention: Will it Halt the Rupee’s Slide? Amidst the weakening Indian Rupee , all eyes are on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The central bank is known to intervene in the forex market to manage currency volatility and maintain stability. Market analysts are speculating whether RBI intervention can effectively limit the INR’s losses in the face of persistent outflows and dollar strength. While RBI intervention can provide temporary relief and curb excessive depreciation, the underlying fundamental factors – foreign fund outflows and US Dollar demand – will likely continue to exert pressure on the Indian Rupee . The effectiveness of RBI’s measures remains a crucial point of observation for traders and investors. Analyzing the Indian Rupee’s Weakness: Key Factors at Play Several factors are contributing to the current weakness in the Indian Rupee : Domestic Equity Market Sentiment : Weakness in domestic equities is dampening investor sentiment and contributing to FII outflows. Global Trade War Fears : Resurfacing fears of a global trade war, particularly in response to potential tariff measures from the US, are adding to risk aversion and negatively impacting emerging market currencies like the INR. Widening Trade Deficit : India’s trade deficit widened in January, reaching $22.99 billion, further straining the Rupee. While a decline in gold imports partially offset this, the overall trade balance remains a concern. However, some factors are providing a slight cushion: Crude Oil Prices : A weak tone in crude oil prices can be beneficial for India, a major oil importer, potentially easing some pressure on the Rupee. US Treasury Yields : A decline in US Treasury yields can reduce the attractiveness of the US Dollar, offering limited support to the INR. USD/INR Technical Outlook: Bullish Momentum Persists From a technical perspective, the USD/INR pair is exhibiting a constructive bullish trend. Analyzing the daily chart: Above Key EMA : The USD/INR price remains above the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), indicating sustained bullish momentum. RSI Indicator : The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is above the midline at 55.0, further supporting the upward momentum and suggesting that the path of least resistance is to the upside. Key Technical Levels to Watch: Level Type USD/INR Level Significance Upside Barrier 1 87.00 Psychological Resistance. A break above could accelerate gains. Upside Target 2 88.00 All-time High. Next major target after 87.00 breach. Upside Target 3 88.50 Further potential target in extended bullish scenario. Initial Support 1 86.35 Low of February 12. First level of support in case of pullback. Support 2 86.14 Low of January 27. Stronger support level below 86.35. Indian Rupee FAQs: Understanding the Dynamics What are the key factors driving the Indian Rupee? The Indian Rupee (INR) is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including: Crude Oil Prices : India’s heavy reliance on oil imports makes the Rupee sensitive to crude oil price fluctuations. US Dollar Value : As most international trade is conducted in USD, the Dollar’s strength significantly impacts the INR. Foreign Investment Flows : Inflows and outflows of foreign investment are crucial determinants of Rupee’s value. RBI Intervention : The Reserve Bank of India’s actions in the forex market play a vital role in managing exchange rate stability. Interest Rates : Interest rate decisions by the RBI influence investor appetite for the Rupee. How do the decisions of the Reserve Bank of India impact the Indian Rupee? The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) impacts the Indian Rupee through: Forex Intervention : RBI actively intervenes to maintain a stable exchange rate, facilitating trade and managing volatility. Interest Rate Policy : By adjusting interest rates to manage inflation (targeting 4%), the RBI influences the Rupee’s attractiveness for investors, particularly in carry trades. Higher rates typically strengthen the Rupee. What macroeconomic factors influence the value of the Indian Rupee? Key macroeconomic factors affecting the Indian Rupee include: Inflation : Higher inflation can weaken the Rupee by reducing export competitiveness and potentially leading to capital outflows. Interest Rates : Higher real interest rates (adjusted for inflation) generally support the Rupee. GDP Growth Rate : Stronger economic growth can attract foreign investment, boosting Rupee demand. Balance of Trade : A less negative trade balance indicates stronger export performance, supporting the Rupee. Foreign Investment Inflows (FDI & FII) : Risk-on environments encourage FDI and FII inflows, strengthening the Rupee. How does inflation impact the Indian Rupee? Inflation’s impact on the Indian Rupee is nuanced: Negative Impact of High Inflation : Comparatively higher inflation can devalue the Rupee, increase export costs, and lead to more Rupees being sold for imports.

Bons said so in a Twitter post defending SOL, which is battling an image crisis in the wake of some high-profile meme coin scams on its platform. The most recent is the $4.5 billion $Libra token scandal that has entangled Argentine President Javier Millei. Others linked to the US First family have been dogged with accusations of insider trading that burnt many users. The CIO, a renowned Solana proponent, held that the blockchain’s dominance explained why scammers preferred it over the others. To him, SOL’s current woes are akin to those the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) blockchains faced in their glory days. He wrote: “Scammers & criminals will always seek out the cutting-edge, as it is on this frontier where they can extract the most, just like the Wild West of old. Does that make the frontier bad? Of course not, in the same way that BTC & ETH were not bad during their heydays.” – Justin Bons Solana faithful must accept some degree of chaos and danger Bons further claimed SOL was an open, public, and truly decentralized chain, which hindered it from containing grifters within its ranks. So, SOL users have to make that concession for the freedoms they enjoy. He called that bravery and challenged those who couldn’t stomach it to leave for other centralized chains. Again, he related Solana’s struggles to those of the early internet, which had a higher degree of porn and cyber crimes. But those shrunk with time as public adoption and consumer protections gathered steam, improving the medium’s respectability. Despite acknowledging the uncanny similarities between SOL and the early Internet, Bons found a major difference. He explained that, unlike the latter, the former consists of thousands of protocols jostling for adoption and dominance. That powerful free market dynamic was net positive as it drove innovation by exerting what he termed as “evolutionary pressure.” However, it exposed users to a lot of “evil,” which meant accepting some level of chaos and danger in return for freedom. Bons’ Solana defense divides opinion As expected, Bons’ analysis drew mixed reactions, with some netizens agreeing with him while others pushed back on his claims. Two users tweeting from X handles @Infrablix and @study0718 resonated with his views and the parallels he drew between crypto now and the internet in its infancy. Another user, @HawktuahA, took a contrary view, emphasizing that SOL’s construction enabled its easy exploitation and wondered how such a chain was a good thing. Still, some, like CardanoDave, were outrightly satirical with him posting a meme ridiculing Bons’ analysis. Roy stomp was even less genial, labeling the CIO a scam. Meanwhile, Xaspa samurai called him a jukebox, suggesting he was pandering to the wishes of the venture capitalists and crypto companies that had him in their pockets. What can Solana do to redeem its image? Some of the respondents also suggested ways in which SOL can clean up its image. Tommy WorldPower, for instance, advised that Solana could adopt a decentralized enforcement system to freeze the errant wallets, and reimburse victims their funds. Robert Sasu, on the other hand, criticized SOL for lacking the tools for arresting obvious rugpulls. He offered that setting minimal limits to token launches would cut off 99% of automatically created ones. Bons himself proposed the reintroduction of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) at scale, as the current regulatory environment allowed. He said ICOs leveled the playing field for VCs and retail investors.

All eyes are on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) as they gear up for their first monetary policy decision of 2025. Whispers of an RBA interest rate cut are growing louder, marking a potential turning point after four years of steady rates. Could this shift in monetary policy ignite volatility in the AUD/USD pair and ripple through the broader crypto market? Let’s dive into what’s expected and why it matters for your crypto portfolio. Will the RBA Deliver the Anticipated Interest Rate Cut? For months, the RBA has held the Official Cash Rate (OCR) firm at 4.35%, battling stubbornly high inflation. But the winds are changing. Signs of Australia inflation easing have emerged, fueling expectations that the central bank will finally pull the trigger on a 25 basis point (bps) interest rate cut. This move would be the first easing since 2020, a significant shift in the economic landscape. Here’s a quick rundown of the key factors at play: Easing Inflation: The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data reveals a slowdown in inflation in the final quarter of 2024. The RBA’s preferred measure, the Trimmed Mean CPI, edged down to 3.2% annually, signaling progress towards their 2-3% target range. Economic Slowdown Concerns: Persistent high interest rates are squeezing households and businesses, leading to concerns about sluggish economic growth. Policymakers are under pressure to provide some relief. Solid Employment Growth: While inflation is cooling, the job market remains robust. Annual employment growth hit a strong 3.1% in December, a factor that could temper the RBA’s enthusiasm for aggressive rate cuts. Despite the mixed signals, market consensus leans towards a rate cut. The question now isn’t necessarily *if* but *how* the RBA will communicate its decision and future intentions. Decoding the Monetary Policy Decision: What to Expect? The RBA’s monetary policy decision isn’t just about the immediate rate move; it’s about the signals they send regarding future policy. Here’s what market participants are keenly watching for: Scenario Likely AUD/USD Impact Crypto Market Reaction (Speculative) 25 bps Rate Cut (as expected) & Cautious Outlook Moderate AUD weakness initially, but potential rebound if future cuts are hinted to be gradual. Neutral to slightly positive sentiment. Reduced pressure on risk assets like crypto. 50 bps Rate Cut (unexpected) or Strong Dovish Signals Significant AUD sell-off. Positive sentiment. Risk-on environment potentially benefiting crypto. 25 bps Rate Cut & Hawkish Signals (hints at limited further easing) AUD could strengthen as markets interpret it as a ‘hawkish cut’. Potentially negative or neutral. Hawkish stance could weigh on broader risk assets. As Valeria Bednarik, Chief Analyst at Bitcoin World, points out, the devil will be in the details. Governor Michele Bullock’s press conference following the announcement will be crucial in deciphering the RBA’s true stance. Will they signal a series of rate cuts, or emphasize a cautious, gradual approach? How Will the RBA Decision Impact AUD/USD and Your Crypto Trades? The AUD/USD impact is a key consideration for crypto traders, particularly those involved in Forex pairings or using AUD as a fiat on-ramp. A weaker Aussie Dollar can influence trading strategies and potentially impact the value of crypto holdings when converted back to AUD. Bednarik’s technical analysis suggests AUD/USD is currently in a bullish stance, hitting its highest level since mid-December. However, the RBA’s announcement could be a pivotal moment. Here are key technical levels to watch: Resistance: 0.6373 (intraday high), 0.6430 (interim), 0.6470 (major resistance zone) Support: 0.6300, 0.6230 A dovish RBA outcome, signaling aggressive rate cuts, could push AUD/USD below the 0.6300 support, potentially triggering further declines. Conversely, hawkish undertones, even with a rate cut, might see the pair test higher resistance levels. Navigating the Interest Rate Outlook: Broader Economic Implications Understanding the interest rate outlook is essential for grasping the bigger picture. Central banks like the RBA use interest rates as a primary tool to manage inflation and stimulate or cool down the economy. Here’s a quick primer on central bank actions: Central Banks FAQs What is the main goal of a central bank? Price stability – keeping inflation within a target range (e.g., 2% for many major central banks). How do central banks control inflation? By adjusting the benchmark interest rate. Higher rates curb spending and investment, cooling inflation. Lower rates encourage borrowing and spending, boosting economic activity. Hawks vs. Doves: ‘Hawkish’ central bankers prioritize controlling inflation, even if it means slower growth. ‘Dovish’ policymakers are more concerned with supporting economic growth and are willing to tolerate slightly higher inflation. The RBA’s shift towards potential rate cuts reflects a global trend as central banks grapple with balancing inflation and economic growth. For crypto investors, monitoring these macroeconomic shifts is crucial as they can influence risk appetite and capital flows, impacting the crypto market. Conclusion: Brace for Potential AUD/USD Volatility The RBA’s upcoming decision is a significant event that could inject volatility into the AUD/USD pair and potentially influence broader market sentiment, including the cryptocurrency space. While an RBA interest rate cut is widely anticipated, the nuances of the accompanying statement and Governor Bullock’s commentary will be critical in shaping market reactions.

The NZD/USD pair is currently navigating a turbulent session, attracting sellers as we approach a pivotal moment: the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s (RBNZ) upcoming rate decision. All eyes are on Wednesday’s announcement, with widespread expectations of a significant interest rate cut. Will this anticipated move trigger a deeper plunge for the Kiwi, or are there any surprise factors that could shift the tide? Let’s dive into the factors driving this currency pair and what you need to watch out for in the volatile world of Forex News. NZD/USD Faces Selling Pressure Amid RBNZ Rate Decision Anticipation The NZD/USD pair is currently experiencing selling pressure, hovering near the 0.5700 mark as Tuesday’s Asian trading session unfolds. This downward momentum is largely attributed to the growing anticipation surrounding the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s (RBNZ) looming rate decision. Market consensus strongly suggests that the RBNZ will implement a substantial interest rate cut at its February meeting on Wednesday, further weighing on the New Zealand Dollar (NZD). Specifically, the market anticipates a significant interest rate cut of 50 basis points (bps), which would bring the Official Cash Rate (OCR) down to 3.75%. This aggressive move is expected to stimulate the New Zealand economy, but simultaneously, it exerts downward pressure on the NZD as lower interest rates typically make a currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking higher yields. Adding to the bearish sentiment, ASB chief economist Nick Tuffley suggests that this week’s cut might just be the beginning. According to Tuffley, the baseline scenario includes further 25bp cuts at each of the subsequent two meetings in April and May. This outlook for a sustained easing cycle is further dampening enthusiasm for the NZD. Decoding the RBNZ Rate Decision: What to Expect The upcoming RBNZ rate decision is more than just a number; it’s a crucial event that can significantly impact the NZD/USD pair and the broader Forex markets. Here’s what traders and investors should be focusing on: Official Cash Rate (OCR) Announcement: The headline event is, of course, the announcement of the new OCR. As mentioned, the consensus points towards a 50 bps cut to 3.75%. Any deviation from this expectation, especially a smaller cut or no cut at all, could trigger a sharp rally in the NZD. Governor Adrian Orr’s Press Conference: Following the rate announcement, RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr will hold a press conference. This is a highly anticipated event as his commentary and tone will provide crucial insights into the future monetary policy path. Pay close attention to any hints about the pace and extent of future rate cuts. Dovish remarks are likely to reinforce selling pressure on the Kiwi. Monetary Policy Statement: The official Monetary Policy Statement released alongside the rate decision will offer detailed justification for the RBNZ’s actions and its economic outlook. Scrutinize this statement for any changes in the RBNZ’s assessment of inflation, employment, and global economic risks. Trade War Concerns and the US Dollar’s Safe-Haven Appeal Beyond the RBNZ decision, global economic uncertainties are also playing a significant role in the NZD/USD dynamics. Escalating trade war concerns are bolstering the US Dollar’s safe-haven appeal, further contributing to the pressure on the NZD/USD pair. US President Donald Trump’s recent statements about potential auto tariffs, slated to begin as soon as April 2nd, have reignited fears of a global trade war. These protectionist measures, a recurring theme in his second term, tend to increase risk aversion in the markets. In times of heightened uncertainty, investors often flock to safe-haven assets like the US Dollar, driving up its value and consequently weighing on pairs like NZD/USD. Furthermore, the potential for the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to maintain its hawkish stance amidst persistent inflation adds another layer of support for the Greenback. If the Fed continues to signal its commitment to fighting inflation through interest rate hikes, it could create a divergence in monetary policy between the US and New Zealand, further strengthening the US Dollar relative to the NZD. RBNZ Monetary Policy: Key Concepts Explained To fully understand the implications of the RBNZ’s actions, it’s helpful to grasp some fundamental concepts of their monetary policy: Concept Description Impact on NZD Official Cash Rate (OCR) The RBNZ’s primary tool to influence inflation and employment. It’s the interest rate at which commercial banks borrow and lend overnight funds to each other. Higher OCR generally strengthens NZD; Lower OCR generally weakens NZD. Inflation Target (CPI) The RBNZ aims to keep inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), within a band of 1% to 3%. When inflation is above target, RBNZ tends to raise rates, supporting NZD. Maximum Sustainable Employment The highest level of employment achievable without causing accelerating inflation. RBNZ considers employment levels when setting interest rates. Strong employment can lead to rate hikes (NZD positive), while weak employment can lead to rate cuts (NZD negative). Quantitative Easing (QE) A last-resort monetary policy tool where the RBNZ buys assets to inject liquidity into the economy. Used in extreme situations like the COVID-19 pandemic. QE typically weakens the NZD. Navigating Currency Markets: Actionable Insights for Traders For traders navigating the current currency markets , particularly the NZD/USD pair, here are some actionable insights: Monitor RBNZ Communications Closely: Stay informed about any statements or hints from RBNZ officials leading up to and following the rate decision. Pay attention to press conferences, speeches, and official releases. Analyze Global Risk Sentiment: Keep an eye on global trade tensions and overall risk appetite. Increased risk aversion tends to favor the US Dollar and weigh on riskier currencies like the NZD. Watch US Economic Data: US economic data releases, particularly inflation figures and employment reports, can influence Fed policy expectations and consequently impact the US Dollar’s strength. Consider Technical Levels: Utilize technical analysis to identify key support and resistance levels for the NZD/USD pair. The 0.5700 level is currently a crucial area to watch. Manage Risk Prudently: Given the potential for volatility around the RBNZ decision, employ appropriate risk management strategies, such as using stop-loss orders and managing position sizes. Conclusion: Bracing for Volatility in NZD/USD The NZD/USD pair is poised for potential volatility as traders brace for the critical RBNZ rate decision. The widely anticipated interest rate cut, coupled with global trade uncertainties and a potentially hawkish Fed, creates a challenging environment for the New Zealand Dollar. Keep a close watch on the RBNZ’s announcements and Governor Orr’s commentary for clues about the future direction of the Kiwi.

This development arrives at a crucial juncture, as global markets closely monitor China’s economic strategies and their potential ripple effects across various sectors, including the cryptocurrency landscape. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, understanding these macroeconomic shifts is vital, as they can indirectly influence market sentiment and investment flows. Decoding China’s NDRC Policies for Private Firms The NDRC’s statement, released on Tuesday, emphasizes the favorable political, economic, and social climate currently prevailing for the growth of the private economy in China. This positive assessment sets the stage for a series of concrete actions designed to bolster private enterprises. Let’s break down the key takeaways from the NDRC’s announcement: Breaking Down Market Access Barriers: China is committed to further dismantling obstacles that hinder market access for private firms. This includes revising and introducing an updated version of the ‘negative list for market access’ promptly. This list specifies sectors where investment is restricted or prohibited, and a revised, shorter list would signify greater openness. Easing Financing Difficulties: Addressing a long-standing concern, the NDRC pledged to continue resolving the difficulties and high costs associated with financing for private enterprises. Access to affordable capital is crucial for the growth and innovation of private businesses, and measures to improve this will be closely watched. Accelerating Private Economy Promotion Law: To provide a stronger legal framework, preparations for the implementation of a private economy promotion law are being expedited. This law aims to safeguard the rights and interests of private businesses and foster a more predictable and supportive legal environment. Protecting Reputation: The NDRC vowed to resolutely crack down on actions that smear or defame the image and reputation of enterprises. This commitment aims to build trust and confidence in the private sector, encouraging fair competition and discouraging unfair practices. Opening Infrastructure Sectors: In a significant move, China will promote the fair opening of competitive areas within infrastructure and major national research infrastructure to private firms . This opens up new avenues for private sector participation in crucial areas of national development. Why These Policies Matter for the Crypto World While seemingly distant from the digital asset realm, China’s policies towards its private firms have indirect but significant implications for the cryptocurrency market. Here’s how: Policy Aspect Potential Crypto Market Impact Improved Business Environment A stronger private sector in China could lead to increased overall economic activity. This can boost investor confidence globally, potentially leading to more risk-on behavior, which can benefit crypto assets. Easier Access to Financing If financing conditions improve for Chinese private firms, it could free up capital and potentially increase investment appetite in various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, especially from Chinese investors looking for diversification. Market Access Reforms While not directly related to crypto exchanges (which remain restricted in China), broader market access reforms could signal a general trend towards greater economic openness. This sentiment can positively influence global market perceptions of China’s economic trajectory. Private Economy Promotion Law A robust legal framework supporting the private economy promotion law can foster a more predictable and stable business environment. Stability in major economies like China is generally viewed favorably by global markets, including crypto. Navigating the Nuances: Challenges and Opportunities While the NDRC’s announcements are undoubtedly positive, the actual implementation and impact of these NDRC policies will be crucial. Some challenges and opportunities to consider: Implementation Speed: The effectiveness of these policies hinges on how quickly and efficiently they are implemented at the local level. Delays or bureaucratic hurdles could dampen the intended positive effects. Global Economic Context: The global economic landscape, including inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical tensions, will also play a significant role in shaping the outcomes of these policies. External factors can influence the overall investment climate, regardless of domestic policy efforts. Investor Sentiment: Ultimately, the success of these policies will depend on how they are perceived by investors, both domestic and international. Positive sentiment and renewed confidence in China’s private firms are essential for translating policy pronouncements into tangible economic gains. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors For those involved in the cryptocurrency market, here are some actionable insights based on these developments: Monitor Implementation: Keep a close watch on the practical implementation of these NDRC policies . Look for concrete evidence of improved market access, easier financing, and the strengthening of the legal framework for private firms. Assess Market Sentiment: Gauge how these policies are impacting overall market sentiment towards Chinese assets and the broader Asian economy. Positive sentiment can create favorable conditions for crypto investments. Consider Indirect Effects: Recognize the indirect channels through which these policies can influence the crypto market. Improved economic stability and investor confidence in China can have positive spillover effects on global risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of further announcements and policy adjustments from the NDRC and other Chinese government bodies. Macroeconomic policy shifts in major economies like China are crucial indicators for global financial markets. Conclusion: A Promising Sign for China’s Private Sector China’s NDRC’s commitment to implementing ‘precise’ policies to support China private firms is a welcome development. By focusing on easing financing difficulties, improving market access , and strengthening the legal environment, these measures aim to unleash the dynamism of the private sector. While the direct impact on the cryptocurrency market may be indirect, the broader macroeconomic implications are undeniable. A thriving Chinese private sector can contribute to global economic stability and potentially create a more favorable environment for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. The world will be watching closely to see how these policies unfold and the extent to which they empower China’s private firms and influence the global economic landscape.

40523404,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=130162,1739933074,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Japanese Yen’s Resilience: Drifting Lower, Yet Poised for a Powerful Rebound?",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/yen-resilience-bullish-rebound-potential/,"In the ever-turbulent world of cryptocurrency and forex trading, understanding the nuances of global currencies is paramount. Today, we’re diving deep into the intriguing movements of the Japanese Yen (JPY). Despite a recent dip fueled by receding safe-haven demand, the Yen’s underlying bullish potential remains firmly intact. Let’s explore the factors at play and what they mean for traders navigating these complex markets. Why is the Japanese Yen Drifting Lower Right Now? The Japanese Yen has experienced a slight retreat, moving away from a one-week high against the US Dollar. This downward drift is primarily attributed to a decrease in its safe-haven appeal. But what exactly does this mean? Reduced Safe-Haven Demand: Investor sentiment plays a huge role in currency valuations. Recently, optimism has increased due to a delay in US President Trump’s proposed reciprocal tariffs and hopes for progress in US-Russia talks regarding the Ukraine conflict. This positive shift in global sentiment reduces the demand for traditional safe-haven assets like the Japanese Yen , leading to a temporary weakening. Modest US Dollar Uptick: Concurrently, we’ve seen a slight strengthening of the US Dollar (USD), further contributing to the USD/JPY pair’s modest recovery from recent lows. However, it’s crucial to understand that this current weakness may be short-lived. The fundamental factors supporting a stronger Yen are still very much in play. The Bullish Case for the Japanese Yen: Why the Dip Might Be a Buying Opportunity Despite the current downward drift, numerous factors suggest that the Japanese Yen retains significant bullish potential. Let’s delve into these key drivers: Rising Expectations of a BoJ Rate Hike The Bank of Japan (BoJ) is under increasing pressure to adjust its ultra-loose monetary policy. Robust economic data from Japan is fueling speculation about imminent interest rate hikes. Here’s why this is critical for the Yen: Strong Q4 GDP Growth: Japan’s impressive Q4 GDP figures, released on Monday, have solidified expectations for policy tightening by the BoJ. This positive economic momentum strengthens the case for higher interest rates. Market Pricing in Rate Hikes: Financial markets are now pricing in approximately 37 basis points of rate increases by the BoJ before the end of the year. This anticipation itself provides upward pressure on the Yen. Japanese Government Bond Yields Surge: Hawkish BoJ expectations have driven Japanese government bond yields to multi-year highs. The benchmark 10-year JGB yield has reached its highest level since April 2010, making Japanese bonds more attractive to investors and supporting the Yen. A BoJ rate hike would mark a significant shift away from years of ultra-loose monetary policy, making the Yen more attractive to global investors seeking yield. Narrowing US-Japan Yield Differential: A Tailwind for JPY The yield differential between US and Japanese bonds is another crucial factor influencing the USD/JPY pair. For years, a wide gap favored the US Dollar, but this dynamic is shifting: US Treasury Yields Decline: Expectations of Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate cuts in the US, potentially as early as September or October, have caused US Treasury bond yields to decline. Fed Rate Cut Expectations: Despite mixed signals from Fed officials, Fed Funds Futures are pricing in a 40 basis point rate cut in the US in 2025. This expectation further compresses US Treasury yields. Impact on USD/JPY: The narrowing yield differential reduces the attractiveness of holding US Dollar assets relative to Japanese Yen assets. This diminished yield advantage for the USD can limit aggressive bearish bets against the lower-yielding JPY and potentially strengthen the Yen. Essentially, as the gap in interest rates between the US and Japan shrinks, the incentive to hold USD over JPY diminishes, providing support for the Japanese Yen . Technical Outlook for USD/JPY: Is a Rebound Imminent? From a technical analysis perspective, the USD/JPY chart reveals some interesting signals: Bearish Signals Prevail: Last week’s failure to break above the 50% retracement level of the January-February downtrend, coupled with a drop below the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), suggests that bearish momentum is currently dominant. Oscillators in Negative Territory: Daily chart oscillators remain in negative territory, reinforcing the view that the path of least resistance for USD/JPY is still downwards. Resistance Levels to Watch: Any upward movement towards the 152.00 mark is likely to encounter selling pressure. Key resistance levels include: 152.00: Psychological level and potential selling zone. 152.65: 200-day SMA, acting as significant resistance. 153.15: 100-day SMA, further resistance level. Support Levels to Monitor: On the downside, immediate support lies at the 151.25 area (Asian session low), followed by: 151.00-150.90: Year-to-date trough, a crucial support zone. 150.00: Psychological level, strong support. 149.60-149.55: Region offering further support. 149.00: Round figure support. 148.65: December 2024 swing low, a significant long-term support level. USD/JPY Key Technical Levels: Resistance Levels Support Levels 152.00, 152.65, 153.15 151.25, 151.00-150.90, 150.00, 149.60-149.55, 149.00, 148.65 For traders, it’s prudent to wait for a strong break above the resistance levels before confirming a bottom in USD/JPY and positioning for a sustained recovery. Conversely, a break below the support levels could signal further downside. Navigating the Japanese Yen: FAQs for Crypto and Forex Traders Understanding the nuances of the Japanese Yen is crucial for informed trading decisions. Here are some frequently asked questions: What key factors drive the Japanese Yen’s value? The Japanese Yen’s value is influenced by a combination of factors, including: Japanese Economic Performance: Overall economic health and growth prospects. Bank of Japan (BoJ) Policy: Monetary policy decisions, interest rate adjustments, and interventions in currency markets. US-Japan Bond Yield Differential: The difference in yields between US and Japanese government bonds. Global Risk Sentiment: Investor appetite for risk; in times of uncertainty, the Yen often acts as a safe haven. How do BoJ decisions impact the Japanese Yen? The BoJ’s monetary policy is a primary driver of the Japanese Yen’s value. Key impacts include: Currency Control Mandate: The BoJ actively manages the Yen’s value, sometimes intervening directly in currency markets. Ultra-Loose Policy (2013-2024): Prolonged low interest rates weakened the Yen due to policy divergence with other central banks. Policy Shift: The gradual unwinding of ultra-loose policy is now providing support to the Yen. How does the US-Japan bond yield differential affect the Japanese Yen? The yield differential is a significant driver, particularly in recent years: Widening Divergence (Past Decade): BoJ’s ultra-loose policy widened the yield gap with the US Fed, favoring the US Dollar. Narrowing Differential (Current Trend): BoJ policy adjustments and potential Fed rate cuts are narrowing this gap, supporting the Yen. How does risk sentiment impact the Japanese Yen? The Japanese Yen’s safe-haven status is crucial during times of market stress: Safe-Haven Asset: Investors flock to the Yen during uncertainty due to its perceived stability. Turbulent Times: Geopolitical instability or economic downturns typically strengthen the Yen against riskier currencies. Tariffs and Trade: A Quick Guide for Context The mention of US President Trump’s tariffs in the news snippet highlights the broader global economic context influencing currency markets. Here’s a brief overview of tariffs: What are tariffs? Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods. Key aspects include: Customs Duties: Levied on specific imported merchandise. Protectionist Tool: Designed to make domestic producers more competitive by increasing the price of imports. Trade Barriers: Used alongside other trade restrictions like quotas. Tariffs vs. Taxes: What’s the difference? While both generate government revenue, tariffs and taxes differ in several ways: Feature Tariffs Taxes Payment Timing Prepaid at port of entry Paid at time of purchase Payer Importers Taxpayers and businesses Are tariffs good or bad for the economy? Economists hold differing views on tariffs: Pro-Tariff Argument: Protection of domestic industries, correction of trade imbalances. Anti-Tariff Argument: Potential for higher prices, risk of trade wars through retaliatory tariffs. Trump’s Tariff Plan: What to know? President Trump’s tariff proposals are significant for global trade: Focus on Major Importers: Targeting countries like Mexico, China, and Canada, which are major sources of US imports. Revenue for Tax Cuts: Intention to use tariff revenue to reduce personal income taxes. Conclusion: Japanese Yen – A Sleeping Bull? The Japanese Yen is currently experiencing a temporary dip, influenced by shifting risk sentiment and a modest USD rebound. However, the underlying bullish factors remain robust. Rising expectations of a BoJ rate hike , coupled with a narrowing US-Japan yield differential , suggest that the Yen’s current weakness may be a transient phase. For astute traders, this could represent a strategic opportunity to position for a potential powerful rebound in the Japanese Yen as fundamental tailwinds reassert themselves.

All eyes are glued to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) as they gear up for their first monetary policy announcement of 2025. Whispers in the market suggest a significant move – an anticipated RBA interest rate cut . But what does this mean for the Australian economy, the Australian Dollar , and your trading strategies? Let’s dive deep into the details and uncover what to expect. Decoding the Expected RBA Interest Rate Cut The financial world is buzzing with anticipation of a 25 basis points (bps) cut to the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by the RBA. After holding steady at 4.35% since November 2023, the pressure is mounting. Why the shift? Stubbornly high inflation and a slowing economy are pushing policymakers to act. But is this just the beginning of a series of cuts? Let’s break down the key factors influencing this pivotal decision: Easing Inflation: The good news is that Australian core inflation showed signs of cooling down in the last quarter of 2024. While still above the RBA’s target range, the deceleration is a crucial factor fueling rate cut expectations. The Trimmed Mean CPI, the RBA’s preferred inflation gauge, came in lower than anticipated, suggesting progress in taming price pressures. Economic Slowdown Concerns: Sluggish economic growth is becoming a major headache. The persistent high interest rates are squeezing households and businesses, impacting overall economic activity. A rate cut could be seen as a necessary stimulus to reignite growth. Strong Employment Data – A Complicating Factor: Here’s the twist – Australia’s employment growth remains robust. Annual employment growth actually strengthened, reaching its highest rate since October 2023. This positive employment data throws a wrench in the works, potentially making the RBA hesitant to aggressively cut rates. Australia Interest Rates : A Balancing Act for the RBA The RBA is walking a tightrope. They need to address the inflation issue, but they also can’t ignore the signs of economic slowdown. The December meeting minutes revealed a nuanced stance. While acknowledging eased upside inflation risks, officials also noted they were only “gaining some confidence” that inflation was moving towards the 2-3% target. Governor Michele Bullock herself highlighted that while rate cuts weren’t off the table, neither were rate hikes, emphasizing a cautious approach. Market sentiment currently leans towards a rate cut, but the prevailing expectation is that the RBA will proceed cautiously. This suggests a slow and measured approach to monetary easing rather than a rapid series of cuts. The RBA’s challenge lies in calibrating Australia interest rates to both manage inflation and support economic growth without triggering unwanted consequences. Monetary Policy Outlook : Clues from the RBA Announcement The real drama unfolds after the RBA interest rate cut announcement. The market’s reaction will heavily depend on the accompanying statement and Governor Bullock’s press conference. Traders and investors will be hanging on every word, searching for clues about the future monetary policy outlook . Key questions on everyone’s mind include: Is this a one-off cut, or the start of a easing cycle? The RBA’s forward guidance will be critical. Any hints of further cuts will have a significant impact. How concerned is the RBA about economic growth? The tone of the statement will reveal the RBA’s priorities – inflation control versus growth support. What are the RBA’s inflation forecasts? Updated forecasts will provide insights into the RBA’s confidence in achieving its inflation target. Australian Dollar (AUD/USD) : Navigating the Forex Seas How will the Australian Dollar (AUD/USD) pair react to the RBA’s decision? A 25 bps rate cut is largely priced in, so the immediate impact might be muted. However, the devil is in the details. Potential AUD/USD Scenarios: RBA Announcement Potential AUD/USD Reaction Explanation 25 bps cut, hawkish statement (hints at no further cuts soon) Potential AUD strength or limited weakness A “hawkish cut” could be interpreted positively as the RBA remains cautious about further easing. 25 bps cut, neutral statement Moderate AUD weakness Expected cut, limited surprise factor. 25 bps cut, dovish statement (hints at more cuts coming) Significant AUD weakness Signifies a shift towards a more aggressive easing cycle. 50 bps cut (unexpected) Sharp AUD sell-off A larger-than-expected cut would be a major dovish surprise. No rate cut (unexpected) Potential AUD spike Markets are heavily positioned for a cut, so no cut would be a hawkish surprise. Valeria Bednarik, Chief Analyst at Bitcoin World, notes the technical setup for AUD/USD: “The AUD/USD pair peaked at 0.6373 ahead of the announcement, its highest since mid-December. Technically, the pair has scope to extend its advance towards the 0.6470 region, but a dovish outcome could push it through the 0.6300 threshold.” She also highlights the uncertainty surrounding US tariffs and their potential impact on the Australian economy as a factor the RBA might consider. RBA FAQs: Understanding the Fundamentals Let’s clarify some key concepts related to the RBA and its influence on the Australian Dollar : What is the Reserve Bank of Australia and how does it influence the Australian Dollar? The RBA is Australia’s central bank, responsible for setting interest rates and managing monetary policy. Its primary goal is price stability (2-3% inflation), but it also aims to contribute to currency stability, full employment, and economic prosperity. Interest rate adjustments are its main tool – higher rates tend to strengthen the AUD, and lower rates weaken it. How does inflation data impact the value of the Australian Dollar? In modern finance, moderate inflation can actually be positive for a currency. It often leads central banks to raise interest rates, attracting foreign capital seeking higher returns. This increased demand strengthens the local currency, like the Aussie Dollar. How does economic data influence the value of the Australian Dollar? Strong economic data signals a healthy and growing economy, attracting investment. Indicators like GDP, PMIs, employment figures, and consumer sentiment can all impact the AUD. Positive data may encourage the RBA to raise rates, further supporting the currency. What is Quantitative Easing (QE) and how does it affect the Australian Dollar? QE is an unconventional tool used in crises. The RBA prints AUD to buy assets (usually bonds) from financial institutions, injecting liquidity. QE typically weakens the AUD. What is Quantitative tightening (QT) and how does it affect the Australian Dollar? QT is the reverse of QE, used during economic recovery to combat rising inflation. The RBA stops buying assets and reinvesting bond principal. QT is generally positive for the AUD. Economic Indicator: RBA Interest Rate Decision The RBA announces its interest rate decision after scheduled meetings. Hawkish stances and rate hikes are usually bullish for the AUD, while dovish views, unchanged rates, or cuts are bearish.

The AUD/JPY pair is currently at a crucial juncture, testing a nine-day support level below 96.50. All eyes are glued to the upcoming Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) policy decision, expected later today. Will the RBA’s anticipated rate cut send the Aussie Dollar tumbling further against the Yen? Let’s dive into the technical analysis and market expectations to understand what could be next for this popular currency pair. AUD/JPY Forecast: Navigating the 96.50 Support Level The AUD/JPY pair is currently dancing around the 96.40 mark during Tuesday’s Asian trading session, attempting a recovery after recent losses. However, this recovery attempt is fragile as the pair grapples with immediate support at the nine-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently around 96.34. This level is proving to be a critical near-term battleground. Adding to the bearish sentiment, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains below the 50 level, hovering in negative territory. This indicator suggests that bearish momentum is still in play, potentially signaling further downside pressure on the AUD/JPY. On the upside, the path of resistance appears to be capped by the descending channel’s upper boundary, looming around the 97.00 level. This channel pattern, visible on the daily chart, reinforces the overall bearish bias in the medium term. RBA Policy Decision: The Key Catalyst for AUD/JPY Traders are holding their breath in anticipation of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) policy decision. The central bank is widely expected to announce a 25 basis points (bps) cut to its Official Cash Rate (OCR), bringing it down to 4.10%. This would mark the first rate cut in four years, a significant shift in monetary policy. Here’s what market participants are expecting from the RBA: Rate Cut Expectation: A 25 bps cut is almost fully priced in by the markets. Forward Guidance: The focus will be on the RBA’s statement and Governor Bullock’s press conference for clues about future policy moves. Will this be the start of a series of cuts, or a one-off adjustment? Market Reaction: The AUD/JPY, and the Australian Dollar in general, is likely to react strongly to the RBA’s announcement and forward guidance. A dovish tone could trigger further AUD weakness. Technical Analysis: Decoding the AUD/JPY Chart A closer look at the daily chart reveals that the AUD/JPY is trading within a descending channel pattern. This technical formation typically suggests a prevailing bearish trend. Let’s break down the key technical levels to watch: Key Technical Indicators: Descending Channel: The pair is confined within a descending channel, indicating a bearish bias. 14-day RSI: Below 50, reinforcing bearish momentum. 9-day EMA: Currently acting as immediate support around 96.34, but neutrality is suggested as price hovers around it. 50-day EMA: Located at 97.18, acting as a significant resistance level above the descending channel’s upper boundary. Critical Price Levels: Level Type Price Level Significance Immediate Support 96.34 (9-day EMA) Break below could accelerate losses Next Support 94.37 Five-month low (Feb 10) Further Support 93.59 Six-month low (Sep 11) Channel Bottom Support Around 93.50 Strong support zone Immediate Resistance 97.00 Descending channel upper boundary Key Resistance 97.18 50-day EMA Major Resistance 98.77 Six-week high (Jan 24) Australian Dollar (AUD) Strength Today Despite the bearish technical outlook for AUD/JPY, it’s worth noting the Australian Dollar’s performance against other major currencies today. As per the table below, the AUD is showing relative strength against some pairs, particularly the New Zealand Dollar. Australian Dollar PRICE Today USD EUR GBP JPY CAD AUD NZD CHF USD 0.15% 0.17% 0.26% 0.07% 0.24% 0.47% 0.09% EUR -0.15% 0.02% 0.11% -0.08% 0.10% 0.32% -0.06% GBP -0.17% -0.02% 0.10% -0.10% 0.08% 0.30% -0.08% JPY -0.26% -0.11% -0.10% -0.19% -0.02% 0.19% -0.18% CAD -0.07% 0.08% 0.10% 0.19% 0.17% 0.40% 0.02% AUD -0.24% -0.10% -0.08% 0.02% -0.17% 0.22% -0.16% NZD -0.47% -0.32% -0.30% -0.19% -0.40% -0.22% -0.37% CHF -0.09% 0.06% 0.08% 0.18% -0.02% 0.16% 0.37% Note: The table shows percentage changes of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today. This relative strength suggests that while AUD/JPY faces specific pressures, the Australian Dollar isn’t universally weak. However, the looming RBA decision is the dominant factor for the AUD/JPY pair. Concluding Thoughts: Brace for Volatility Post-RBA The AUD/JPY is delicately poised ahead of the RBA policy decision. The 96.50 support level is under intense scrutiny, and a break below this could open the door for a test of lower levels, potentially towards the 94.37 five-month low. Conversely, a surprise hawkish tilt from the RBA, although unlikely, or a weaker-than-expected Yen, could trigger a bullish reversal, targeting the 97.00-97.18 resistance zone. For Forex traders, this means heightened volatility is expected in the AUD/JPY pair during and after the RBA announcement. Careful risk management and monitoring of price action around key technical levels will be crucial in navigating potential trading opportunities.

PS Plus Extra subscribers will access Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, Mordhau, SaGa Frontier Remastered, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Top Spin 2K25, Somerville, and Tin Hearts. The games are available for gamers with PS4 and PS5 consoles. PS Plus Premium subscribers will access Patapon 3 and Dropship: United Peace Force, available on PSP and PS2, respectively.

The 6-player survival game Abiotic Factor from Deep Field Games and Playstack will also come to the Game Catalog this summer.

The gaming company also highlighted that canceling membership and subscribing afterward would not work for gamers who had already subscribed to the two subscription plans. Many gamers still found the discounts unfair. A Reddit thread revealed the thoughts of the gaming community, where some commenters believed that the discounts did not make sense. Others also believed that Sony had been unfair in PS Plus discount offerings for several years. Sony shreds 10 games from the PS Plus Game Catalog Last chance to play got updated.

Sony further discontinued 11 titles on January 14, including Legend of Mana, Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection, Life Is Strange, Life is Strange: Before the Storm, and Just Cause 3.

The move permits institutional investors to buy tokenized shares of the fund with U.S. dollars or stablecoins like as ( USDC ) USDC and USDT ( USDT ), according to Bloomberg . The Invesco private credit fund primarily invests in senior secured loans and has delivered a 4.5% annual net yield since its inception in 2006, DigiFT CEO Henry Zhang said. Unlike most tokenized private credit funds, which have long redemption cycles, this fund will offer daily liquidity, making it a more flexible option for investors. Tokenization, the process of converting conventional assets into digital representations on the blockchain, is expanding quickly. 80% of real-world assets that are currently on-chain are private credit, which is driving this trend, according to rwa.xyz.

The asset manager estimates that tokenized funds could manage up to $600 billion by 2030, representing 1% of the total assets in mutual and exchange-traded funds. DigiFT, already a key player in the tokenization space, recently became the first distribution partner for UBS’s uMint, a tokenized money market fund. The platform is subject to Singaporean regulations and is licensed as a market operator and capital markets entity. Settlements for DigiFT’s tokenized Invesco fund will take up to five days, despite the fact that redemptions are available every day. While liquidity providers manage the underlying settlement process, Zhang disclosed plans to launch an on-chain liquidity pool that would enable investors to rapidly redeem tokens at a little discount. With prominent asset managers like Franklin Templeton and BlackRock adopting tokenization, DigiFT’s most recent action highlights how blockchain is increasingly being used in TradFi.

Is It Poised to Be the Next $100M Crypto Leader?,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-whales-dive-into-web3bay-is-it-poised-to-be-the-next-100m-crypto-leader/,"Web3Bay is quickly making a name for itself by offering a decentralized alternative to traditional e-commerce platforms. In contrast to centralized giants like Amazon and eBay, which dominate with high fees and unilateral transaction control, Web3Bay leverages blockchain technology for facilitating direct peer-to-peer transactions. This shift not only secures transactions but also slashes the cost of transacting, enhancing user autonomy. As of February 18, 2025, the platform’s presale has successfully garnered over $1.4 million and sold more than 350 million tokens. Currently, in Stage 4, the 3BAY token is priced at $0.004562625, with an anticipated launch price of $0.1959, suggesting a potential 4,200% gain for early backers. The presale’s structured 28-stage approach, with each stage offering a 15% price hike, is designed to boost early engagement and has evidently resonated well within the investment community, signaling strong confidence in Web3Bay’s capacity to transform the global e-commerce landscape. What Draws Venture Capitalists & Crypto Whales to Invest? Web3Bay’s presale velocity is substantially fueled by the active participation of venture capitalists and crypto whales, who are betting big on the project’s future. A key allure is Web3Bay’s potential to disrupt the e-commerce sector, a behemoth valued at $6 trillion yet plagued by centralization. Traditional platforms impose strict seller conditions, hefty fees, and wield control over user data. By removing these impediments through a blockchain-based model, Web3Bay hands power back to the users, presenting a groundbreaking shift in online buying and selling dynamics. This paradigm shift is viewed by investors as a lucrative, long-term investment. The high potential for return on investment (ROI) during the early presale phases also attracts substantial capital, with projections showing token prices spiking to $0.1959 at launch. Early participants could witness substantial financial gains. Moreover, the involvement of institutional investors and prominent crypto figures lends further legitimacy, as such entities typically back projects with solid fundamentals and sustainable value. Another standout feature of Web3Bay is its commitment to security and transaction transparency. E-commerce is often riddled with fraud and disputes; Web3Bay addresses these issues with smart contracts and decentralized identity verification, ensuring reliable and open transactions, thus positioning itself as a superior choice to conventional marketplaces. Comparative Market Analysis & Prospective Insights While numerous crypto ventures lean towards speculative trading, Web3Bay offers tangible real-world applications. In contrast to blockchain projects like Solana and Cardano, which focus on enhancing blockchain scalability, Web3Bay targets the practical needs of the e-commerce industry. Ethereum, despite its widespread adoption, suffers from high transaction fees, rendering it less suitable for minor transactions. Conversely, Web3Bay presents a cost-effective solution tailored for e-commerce. Unlike NFT platforms such as OpenSea and Blur, which are geared towards digital assets, Web3Bay broadens blockchain’s applicability to physical goods and services. With a robust presale backed by significant investments from whales and venture capital, Web3Bay is poised for a bright future. It addresses core e-commerce challenges while offering investors substantial growth potential. As the presale continues and adoption increases, Web3Bay is well-positioned to become the premier decentralized marketplace, revolutionizing the trade of goods and services online. For investors looking for practical utility and significant expansion potential, Web3Bay emerges as an exceptional choice.

The usually vibrant world of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing a noticeable shift. Recent reports indicate a significant downturn in capital flowing into these leading cryptocurrencies. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez dropped a bombshell on X, revealing a startling statistic: capital inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum have plummeted by over 30% in the past month alone. This dramatic decrease, shrinking from a robust $45 billion to a more modest $30 billion, raises crucial questions about the current state of the crypto market and what it means for investors like you. Understanding the Dip in Bitcoin Capital Inflows Let’s unpack what this Bitcoin capital inflows decrease actually signifies. Capital inflow, in simple terms, represents the money flowing into an asset – in this case, Bitcoin and Ethereum. A reduction in this flow can be influenced by a multitude of factors, and it often serves as a key indicator of investor sentiment and market momentum. Why is this happening now? Several potential factors could be at play: Market Correction: After periods of significant gains, markets often experience corrections. Investors might be taking profits, leading to reduced new capital entering the market. Regulatory Uncertainty: Ongoing regulatory discussions and actions globally can create uncertainty, prompting investors to become more cautious and potentially reducing Bitcoin capital inflows . Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions like inflation, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical events can influence investor risk appetite, impacting investments in volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Alternative Investment Opportunities: The emergence of new investment avenues, within or outside the crypto space, could be diverting capital away from Bitcoin and Ethereum. To put this into perspective, consider the following table illustrating the capital inflow trend: Cryptocurrency Capital Inflow (Previous Month) Capital Inflow (Current Month) Change Bitcoin (BTC) & Ethereum (ETH) Combined $45 Billion $30 Billion -33.3% Ethereum Capital Inflows Mirror Bitcoin’s Downtrend Just like Bitcoin, Ethereum capital inflows are also experiencing a significant contraction. This parallel movement suggests a broader market sentiment shift rather than an isolated issue affecting only one cryptocurrency. Ethereum, often seen as the backbone of the decentralized web and DeFi, usually attracts substantial investment. A 30% drop here is equally noteworthy and warrants close attention. The reasons mirroring Bitcoin’s decline could be amplified by Ethereum-specific factors: Post-Merge Consolidation: Following the successful Merge, the initial excitement might be subsiding, leading to a period of consolidation and potentially reduced immediate Ethereum capital inflows . Competition from Layer-2 Solutions: The growth of Layer-2 scaling solutions on Ethereum, while beneficial for the ecosystem, could temporarily redistribute capital flows within the Ethereum network, potentially impacting direct inflows into ETH itself. DeFi Market Dynamics: Fluctuations in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) market, heavily reliant on Ethereum, can directly impact investor confidence and consequently, Ethereum capital inflows . Impact on the Crypto Market: Is This a Cause for Concern? The combined decrease in crypto market capital inflows for Bitcoin and Ethereum naturally raises concerns about the overall health and direction of the cryptocurrency market. While a 30% drop is substantial, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. The crypto market is known for its volatility and cyclical nature. Dips and corrections are not uncommon and can even be healthy for long-term growth by shaking out excessive speculation and allowing for more sustainable market foundations. However, this downturn should not be dismissed lightly. Sustained reduced inflows could potentially lead to: Price Corrections: Reduced demand due to lower capital inflows can exert downward pressure on prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and potentially other cryptocurrencies. Reduced Liquidity: Lower inflows can decrease market liquidity, making it potentially more challenging to execute large trades without impacting prices significantly. Shift in Investor Sentiment: Prolonged periods of reduced inflows can negatively impact overall investor sentiment, leading to a more cautious or even bearish market outlook. Investment Trends: Navigating the Current Waters For investors, understanding these investment trends is paramount. A decrease in capital inflows doesn’t necessarily signal the end of the crypto bull run, but it does serve as a crucial signal to reassess strategies and exercise caution. Here are some actionable insights for navigating this phase: Diversification: Now, more than ever, diversification is key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Explore different asset classes and diversify within the crypto space itself. Due Diligence: Thorough research and due diligence are essential. Understand the projects you invest in and stay updated on market developments. Risk Management: Implement robust risk management strategies. Determine your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Consider using stop-loss orders and portfolio rebalancing techniques. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that cryptocurrency investments are often long-term plays. Short-term fluctuations are part of the game. Focus on the long-term potential and fundamentals of your chosen assets. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory updates, and macroeconomic trends that can influence the crypto market. Crypto Analysis: What Does the Future Hold? Expert crypto analysis of these capital inflow trends suggests a period of market recalibration. While the 30% drop is significant, it could also be a temporary phase within a larger growth cycle. The crypto market is still relatively young and prone to significant swings. The long-term trajectory will likely depend on factors such as: Institutional Adoption: Continued institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies remains a critical driver for sustained growth. Technological Advancements: Ongoing technological developments and innovations within the blockchain and crypto space will shape future market trends. Regulatory Clarity: Increased regulatory clarity and supportive frameworks from governments worldwide will be crucial for mainstream adoption and attracting further capital inflows. In conclusion, the 30% drop in capital inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum is a noteworthy development demanding attention. It signals a potential shift in market dynamics and underscores the importance of informed investment strategies. While it may induce caution, it also presents an opportunity for strategic investors to reassess, adapt, and position themselves for the next phase of the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Stay informed, stay vigilant, and navigate these waters with wisdom.

40524030,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=130198,1739934336,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial ESMA Guidelines: Landmark Crypto Regulation for Crypto Firm Competence,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/esma-guidelines-crypto-firm-competence/,"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, regulatory clarity is paramount. For crypto businesses operating in Europe, a significant development is on the horizon. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU’s financial watchdog, has just dropped a bombshell – proposed guidelines aimed at ensuring the crypto firm competence of staff within crypto asset service providers. This move, aligning with the landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation, signals a new era of accountability and professionalism in the crypto space. Let’s dive into what these guidelines entail and what they mean for the future of crypto businesses and professionals. Why is Crypto Firm Competence Suddenly a Hot Topic? The explosive growth of the cryptocurrency market has brought immense opportunities, but also significant risks. From market volatility to complex technological underpinnings, and the ever-present threat of financial crime, the crypto landscape demands a high level of expertise. Regulators worldwide are increasingly concerned about investor protection and market integrity. The EU, through MiCA, is taking a proactive stance, and ESMA’s proposed guidelines on crypto firm competence are a crucial step in operationalizing this regulation. But why now? Consider these factors: Investor Protection Imperative: As more retail investors enter the crypto market, ensuring they are dealing with knowledgeable and ethical professionals becomes vital. Incompetent staff can lead to mis-selling, poor advice, and ultimately, financial losses for investors. Market Stability Concerns: Lack of expertise within crypto firms can contribute to market instability. Understanding market operations, pricing mechanisms, and risk management is essential for maintaining a stable and efficient crypto ecosystem. Combating Financial Crime: The crypto space, unfortunately, has been targeted by illicit activities. Staff with a deep understanding of regulatory frameworks, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) obligations are crucial in preventing and detecting financial crime. Technological Complexity: Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are inherently complex. Staff need to grasp these intricacies to provide informed services and navigate the technical challenges of the industry. Global Regulatory Pressure: International bodies and national regulators are increasingly focusing on crypto regulation. The EU’s move is part of a global trend towards establishing clear standards and frameworks for the crypto industry. Decoding the ESMA Guidelines: What Skills are in Demand? ESMA’s proposed guidelines are not just about ticking boxes; they aim to foster genuine expertise within crypto firms. The regulator has outlined specific areas of knowledge and skills that staff should possess. Let’s break down the key components of crypto firm competence as defined by ESMA: Area of Competence Description Why it Matters Crypto Risks Understanding Knowledge of the inherent risks associated with crypto assets, including market volatility, technological vulnerabilities, cybersecurity threats, and regulatory risks. Essential for risk management, investor education, and responsible service provision. Market Operations Expertise Understanding how crypto markets function, including trading mechanisms, order book dynamics, market participants, and liquidity considerations. Crucial for fair pricing, efficient trading, and preventing market manipulation. Pricing and Valuation Knowledge Ability to analyze crypto asset pricing, understand valuation methodologies, and identify factors influencing price movements. Important for providing investment advice, managing portfolios, and ensuring fair pricing practices. Blockchain Technology Proficiency Solid grasp of blockchain technology, its underlying principles, different types of blockchains, and their applications in crypto assets. Necessary for understanding the technical aspects of crypto assets, assessing project viability, and navigating technological developments. Regulatory Frameworks Mastery Comprehensive knowledge of relevant regulations, including MiCA, AML/CTF directives, data protection laws, and consumer protection regulations. Fundamental for compliance, legal operations, and ensuring ethical business practices. Tax Implications Awareness Understanding the tax implications of crypto assets, including income tax, capital gains tax, VAT, and reporting obligations in relevant jurisdictions. Vital for providing accurate tax information to clients and ensuring tax compliance for the firm. These competency areas are not just theoretical. They translate into practical skills needed for various roles within crypto firms, from customer service representatives to compliance officers and portfolio managers. ESMA’s guidelines emphasize that the level of competence required should be proportionate to the role and responsibilities of the staff member. What are the Implications of These ESMA Guidelines? The proposed guidelines on ESMA guidelines for staff competence are poised to have a far-reaching impact on the crypto industry in Europe. Here are some key implications: Elevated Industry Standards: These guidelines will likely drive up the professional standards within the crypto industry. Firms will need to invest in training and development to ensure their staff meets the required competency levels. Increased Compliance Burden: Crypto asset service providers will face a greater compliance burden as they implement processes to assess and maintain staff competence. This could involve developing internal training programs, conducting competency assessments, and maintaining records of staff qualifications. Competitive Advantage for Compliant Firms: Firms that proactively embrace these guidelines and prioritize staff competence may gain a competitive advantage. Investors and partners are likely to favor firms that demonstrate a commitment to professionalism and regulatory compliance. Enhanced Investor Trust: By ensuring staff competence, these guidelines aim to build greater investor trust in the crypto market. Knowing that professionals within crypto firms are knowledgeable and qualified can boost investor confidence and encourage wider adoption. Potential for Industry Consolidation: The increased compliance burden and the need for investment in training could lead to some consolidation within the crypto industry. Smaller firms may find it challenging to meet the new requirements, potentially leading to mergers or acquisitions by larger, better-resourced players. Navigating the Future of Crypto Regulation and Competence The release of these proposed crypto regulation guidelines marks a significant step towards a more mature and regulated crypto market in Europe. While the guidelines are still in the consultation phase – with feedback being gathered until April 22nd and final guidelines expected in the third quarter – crypto firms should start preparing now. Here are some actionable insights: Assess Current Staff Competence: Firms should conduct a thorough assessment of the current competence levels of their staff across the areas outlined by ESMA. Identify any gaps in knowledge and skills. Develop Training Programs: Based on the competency assessment, develop targeted training programs to address identified gaps. These programs should cover the key areas of knowledge and skills highlighted in the ESMA guidelines. Implement Competency Assessment Processes: Establish ongoing processes for assessing and maintaining staff competence. This could involve regular training, knowledge tests, performance reviews, and professional development requirements. Stay Informed and Engage with Regulators: Keep abreast of regulatory developments, including the final ESMA guidelines and any updates to MiCA. Engage with industry associations and regulators to stay informed and contribute to the evolving regulatory landscape. Prioritize a Culture of Compliance and Professionalism: Foster a company culture that prioritizes compliance, ethical conduct, and continuous professional development. This is not just about meeting regulatory requirements; it’s about building a sustainable and reputable crypto business. Conclusion: A New Era of Professionalism in Crypto ESMA’s proposed guidelines on MiCA regulation and staff competence are a clear signal: the era of the Wild West in crypto is coming to an end in Europe. These guidelines are not just about regulation; they are about fostering a more professional, trustworthy, and sustainable crypto ecosystem. By prioritizing staff competence, the EU is taking a proactive approach to investor protection, market integrity, and responsible innovation. For crypto businesses, embracing these changes is not just about compliance – it’s about building a foundation for long-term success in a rapidly evolving industry.

Grassley also pointed out that Elon’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) has the full backing of President Donald Trump. The mass firings across federal agencies, which have already gutted regulatory bodies and watchdog organizations, are an executive branch decision, Grassley explained . “The Constitution says all executive power of the federal government shall be vested … in the office of the presidency.” Trump and Elon Musk defend the cuts on Fox News Trump and Elon will address the government shake-up in a pre-taped Fox News interview set to air in a few hours. The conversation, recorded Friday with host Sean Hannity, is their first joint sit-down since Trump returned to office last month. Fox released a preview of the interview, showing Elon discussing his political change from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. “I used to be adored by the left,” Elon said. “Less so these days because of my support for Trump.” Elon blamed what he called “Trump Derangement Syndrome,” adding, “You don’t realize how real this is until you can’t reason with people. It’s like they’ve become completely irrational.” Trump, speaking yesterday at a Florida news conference, teased the interview, telling reporters that he warned Elon Musk about potential conflicts of interest between his private companies and government projects. “I told Elon straight up: You can’t work on government projects that interfere with your companies,” Trump said, referencing Elon’s SpaceX, which contracts with NASA. Elon Musk shuts down agencies, expands control Elon has wasted no time dismantling federal agencies. Last week, he shut down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an agency created after the 2008 financial crash to protect consumers from bank fraud and fintech scams. Elon Musk announced the closure with a single post on X: “CFPB RIP” followed by a gravestone emoji. His decision effectively kills consumer financial protections, stripping oversight from the fintech industry just as Elon’s own X platform secures a top banking deal, something the Democrats were quick to point out. Days before shutting down the CFPB, Elon’s X signed a deal with Visa to launch X Money Account, part of his push to turn X into an “everything app.” The platform will now offer banking services, social media, AI support, and, as critics point out, a haven for extremist propaganda—all under one roof. Trump defended Elon’s unchecked power, saying the billionaire is policing his own conflicts. “Elon is doing a fantastic job,” Trump told reporters. “You can trust him.” A report from the Financial Times claims that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had expected a formal state meeting when he visited Washington last week, but instead, he found himself sitting across from three of Elon’s children and one of their mothers in what was supposed to be an official discussion on Tesla and SpaceX expansion in India.

The Bitcoin market, known for its wild swings, has been unusually calm lately. But is this tranquility the calm before the storm? For months, Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading within a surprisingly narrow band, leaving many wondering – what’s next? Let’s dive into the expert analysis that suggests we might be on the verge of a significant price movement . Why is Bitcoin’s Price Range So Tight? According to senior analyst James Van Straten from CoinDesk, Bitcoin has been confined to a tight BTC price range of $91,000 to $109,000 since late November. This period of stability is quite unusual for Bitcoin, which is typically known for its dramatic ups and downs. Think of it like a coiled spring – the longer it’s compressed, the more forcefully it’s likely to snap back. Van Straten points out a key market characteristic: volatility tends to mean-revert. In simpler terms, periods of low Bitcoin volatility are often followed by periods of high volatility, and vice versa. This natural ebb and flow is a fundamental aspect of market dynamics. Data Deep Dive: Signs of Impending Volatility Expansion To back up his analysis, Van Straten cites compelling data from Glassnode, a leading on-chain analytics firm. Let’s break down the key indicators signaling a potential volatility expansion : Two-Week Realized Volatility: This metric has plummeted to an annualized 32%, hitting multi-year lows. Realized volatility essentially measures the actual price fluctuations over a specific period. A low reading indicates a period of relative price stability. One-Month Implied Volatility: Similarly, implied volatility, which reflects market expectations of future price swings, has dipped below 50%. This is also at multi-year lows, suggesting that traders are not currently anticipating significant price fluctuations in the near term. Checkmate’s “Choppiness Index”: Analyst Checkmate’s proprietary index further reinforces the picture of suppressed volatility. On a weekly chart, the Choppiness Index indicates that Bitcoin’s trading range is at its narrowest since 2015. Imagine Bitcoin trading in a corridor so tight it’s like walking a tightrope! These indicators collectively paint a picture of a market holding its breath, with Bitcoin volatility suppressed to levels rarely seen in recent years. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? The million-dollar question, of course, is what happens next? Van Straten suggests that Bitcoin is poised to break out of this constricted range soon. However, the direction of this breakout remains uncertain. Will we see a surge upwards, or a sharp correction downwards? Here’s what to consider in this unpredictable crypto market analysis : Potential for a Significant Price Movement: The longer Bitcoin remains in this tight range, the greater the potential for a powerful breakout. Think of it like shaking a soda bottle – the pressure builds up, and when it finally opens, the release can be explosive. Uncertainty in Direction: While volatility is expected to increase, the direction of the price movement is not guaranteed. It could be upwards, driven by renewed bullish sentiment, or downwards, potentially triggered by negative news or profit-taking. Importance of Risk Management: In times of anticipated volatility, risk management becomes paramount. Traders and investors should be prepared for potentially rapid and significant price swings. Strategies like stop-loss orders and portfolio diversification can be crucial. To visualize the situation, consider the table below summarizing the key volatility indicators: Volatility Indicator Current Level Significance Two-Week Realized Volatility Annualized 32% Multi-year Low One-Month Implied Volatility Below 50% Multi-year Low Checkmate’s Choppiness Index Tightest Range Since 2015 Actionable Insights: Preparing for Bitcoin’s Next Move So, what should you do amidst this anticipation of increased Bitcoin volatility ? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on market news and analysis. Developments in regulation, institutional adoption, and macroeconomic factors can all influence Bitcoin’s price. Review Your Risk Tolerance: Assess your comfort level with potential price swings. Volatility can present opportunities, but also carries risks. Adjust your portfolio and trading strategies accordingly. Consider Trading Strategies: For active traders, volatility breakouts can offer trading opportunities. Strategies like breakout trading or volatility-based options strategies might become relevant. However, these require careful execution and risk management. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term investors, short-term volatility might be less concerning. Focus on the long-term fundamentals of Bitcoin and its potential in the evolving digital asset landscape. Conclusion: Brace Yourselves for Potential Bitcoin Volatility The current lull in Bitcoin volatility appears to be a temporary state. Expert analysis and data indicators suggest that we are nearing a point where Bitcoin is likely to break free from its current BTC price range . Whether this breakout will be upwards or downwards remains to be seen. However, one thing is clear: the crypto market is about to get interesting again. Prepare for potential price swings and ensure your risk management strategies are in place. The coiled spring is about to release!

40524142,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=130349,1739934556,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent SEC Shift? Ripple Appeal Pause Predicted in Dramatic Crypto Regulation Twist!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-ripple-appeal-pause/,"In a potentially seismic shift for the cryptocurrency landscape, John Reed Stark, a former high-ranking official at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has dropped a bombshell prediction. Stark, who once headed the SEC’s Office of Internet Enforcement, took to X (formerly Twitter) to suggest that the SEC might be on the verge of pausing or even withdrawing all pending crypto-related appeals, most notably the high-profile case against Ripple. This bold forecast has sent ripples (pun intended!) through the crypto community, sparking intense debate and speculation about the future of crypto regulation in the United States. Is this the dawn of a new era for digital assets, or just a temporary lull in the regulatory storm? Why a Pause on Crypto Appeals? Understanding the SEC’s Potential Strategy Shift Stark’s prediction hinges on the recent formation of a dedicated crypto task force within the SEC. He posits that this task force is not just another bureaucratic layer, but a strategic move to fundamentally reassess and potentially streamline the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation . Instead of continuing costly and potentially protracted legal battles, Stark suggests the SEC might be opting for a more unified and decisive strategy. But what could be driving this apparent change of heart? Resource Reallocation: Legal appeals are resource-intensive, demanding significant time, personnel, and financial capital. Pausing appeals could free up these resources, allowing the SEC to focus on other critical areas, perhaps including the development of clearer regulatory frameworks. Strategic Reassessment: The crypto landscape is rapidly evolving. A pause could provide the SEC with valuable time to reassess its regulatory strategies, ensuring they are effective and adaptable to the dynamic nature of digital assets. Task Force Influence: The newly formed crypto task force likely brings fresh perspectives and expertise. Their recommendations might be pushing for a more pragmatic and less litigious approach to crypto regulation . Public and Industry Pressure: The SEC has faced increasing pressure from the crypto industry and even some lawmakers to provide clearer guidance and avoid stifling innovation through enforcement actions. A pause could be seen as a response to this pressure. However, it’s crucial to remember that this is a prediction, albeit from a well-informed source. The SEC has not officially announced any such plans. The crypto world is now holding its breath, waiting to see if Stark’s forecast will materialize. Ripple Case in the Spotlight: What Does a Pause Mean for XRP? The mention of Ripple in Stark’s prediction is particularly noteworthy. The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs, alleging that XRP is an unregistered security, has been one of the most closely watched legal battles in the crypto space. A pause in the appeal process would have significant implications for Ripple and the XRP token. Potential Ripple Case Scenarios if SEC Pauses Appeals: Scenario Potential Impact on Ripple & XRP Temporary Pause: SEC halts appeal to reassess strategy. Uncertainty remains, but short-term positive sentiment for XRP as immediate legal pressure eases. Withdrawal of Appeal: SEC drops the appeal entirely. Major victory for Ripple. XRP price could see a significant surge. Increased clarity and potential for wider adoption of XRP. Negotiated Settlement: SEC and Ripple reach a settlement outside of court. Positive outcome for Ripple, potentially involving some concessions but avoiding prolonged legal battles. XRP likely to react positively. For XRP holders and the broader Ripple community, the prospect of a pause or withdrawal of the appeal is undoubtedly exciting. It could signal a turning point in the long-standing legal saga and potentially pave the way for a more constructive relationship between Ripple and regulators. Crypto Appeals Across the Board: A Wider Regulatory Shift? Stark’s prediction extends beyond just the Ripple case, suggesting a potential pause or withdrawal of all crypto appeals . This broader implication is even more significant, hinting at a possible paradigm shift in how the SEC approaches crypto enforcement. If the SEC is indeed reconsidering its aggressive litigation strategy, what could be the underlying reasons? Factors Potentially Influencing SEC’s Approach to Crypto Appeals: Legislative Pressure: Growing calls for clearer crypto legislation from Congress might be prompting the SEC to re-evaluate its enforcement-centric approach in favor of more collaborative regulatory frameworks. Court Rulings: Recent court decisions in crypto-related cases might have given the SEC pause, suggesting that their legal arguments are not always guaranteed to prevail. Industry Engagement: A pause could be a strategic move to foster more dialogue and collaboration with the crypto industry, aiming for more practical and industry-informed regulations. Global Regulatory Landscape: The SEC might be observing how other jurisdictions are regulating crypto and considering adopting best practices or harmonizing regulations internationally. A widespread pause on crypto appeals would signal a significant change in the regulatory climate. It could foster a more innovation-friendly environment, potentially attracting more investment and development in the crypto space within the U.S. John Reed Stark’s Insight: A Credible Voice in Crypto Regulation? John Reed Stark’s prediction carries weight due to his extensive experience within the SEC. Having served as chief of the Office of Internet Enforcement, he possesses an insider’s perspective on the agency’s operations and regulatory thinking. His insights are often closely followed by the crypto community, and his pronouncements can influence market sentiment. While his predictions are not infallible, they offer valuable context and potential foreshadowing of future regulatory actions. However, it’s essential to approach any prediction with a degree of caution. Regulatory bodies like the SEC are complex organizations with multiple stakeholders and evolving priorities. Stark’s view, while informed, represents one perspective. The actual direction of SEC policy will depend on a multitude of factors and internal decision-making processes. What’s Next for Crypto Regulation? Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community Whether or not Stark’s prediction comes to fruition, the situation highlights the ongoing uncertainty and evolution of crypto regulation . For individuals and businesses operating in the crypto space, what are the key takeaways and actionable insights? Actionable Insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments, not just in the U.S. but globally. Follow credible news sources, legal experts, and industry analysts. Engage in Dialogue: Participate in industry discussions and advocate for sensible and innovation-friendly regulations. Engage with policymakers and regulators when opportunities arise. Compliance Focus: Prioritize compliance with existing regulations and prepare for potential future regulatory changes. Robust compliance frameworks are crucial for long-term sustainability in the crypto space. Diversification: In the face of regulatory uncertainty, diversification remains a prudent strategy. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, whether it’s specific cryptocurrencies or regulatory jurisdictions. Prepare for Volatility: Regulatory news can significantly impact crypto markets. Be prepared for potential price volatility and manage risk accordingly. A Turning Point or a Temporary Reprieve? The Future of Crypto Regulation Hangs in the Balance John Reed Stark’s prediction of a potential SEC pause on crypto appeals has injected a dose of cautious optimism into the crypto market. Whether this signifies a genuine shift in the SEC’s regulatory approach or merely a tactical pause remains to be seen. However, it undeniably underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of crypto regulation . The coming weeks and months will be crucial in determining the SEC’s next moves and the long-term trajectory of crypto oversight in the United States. For now, the crypto world watches, waits, and speculates on whether this prediction will usher in a more constructive era of crypto regulation , or if it’s simply a momentary calm before the next regulatory wave.

Many are asking this question as we navigate the ever-exciting, often volatile world of cryptocurrency. But hold on to your hats, crypto enthusiasts! According to on-chain analyst oinonen_t, the current Bitcoin cycle still has significant upward potential, even after the recent halving event. Let’s dive into why this analyst believes the Bitcoin story is far from over and what factors could fuel the next leg up in the crypto market growth . Bitcoin Halving Cycle: Are We Still Early? For those new to the crypto space, a Bitcoin halving is a pre-programmed event that occurs roughly every four years, reducing the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks by half. Historically, these halvings have been followed by significant price increases. Oinonen_t’s analysis, shared on CryptoQuant, suggests we might be in a similar, yet still early, phase of the post-halving cycle. Let’s break down the numbers: 2020 Halving: Following the 2020 halving, Bitcoin experienced a staggering 686% surge. 2024 Halving (to date): Since the April 2024 halving, Bitcoin’s increase has been a more modest 63%. This data points to a considerable difference in percentage gains, suggesting that if historical patterns repeat, there could be substantial room for further BTC price prediction increases in this cycle. While past performance isn’t a guarantee of future results, these historical trends are definitely something to consider. Could we see a similar explosive growth trajectory as seen in previous cycles? Time will tell, but the analyst’s perspective certainly offers a hopeful outlook. Institutional Demand for Bitcoin: The MicroStrategy Effect Beyond historical cycles, another key indicator highlighted in the analysis is the continued strong institutional demand for Bitcoin . Leading the charge in this space is business intelligence firm Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). Their relentless accumulation of Bitcoin speaks volumes about the confidence institutional players have in the long-term value proposition of BTC. Why is this significant? Market Validation: Large institutions investing in Bitcoin lends credibility and legitimacy to the asset class. Reduced Supply: As institutions buy and hold Bitcoin, it reduces the available supply on exchanges, potentially driving up prices. Leading Indicator: Institutional investment is often seen as a leading indicator, suggesting that smart money anticipates future price appreciation. Strategy’s ongoing Bitcoin buying spree isn’t just a headline; it’s a tangible demonstration of strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future. This institutional demand for Bitcoin acts as a powerful tailwind, potentially pushing prices higher as more institutions enter or expand their crypto holdings. Macroeconomic Impact on Crypto: The Ukraine Factor The analysis also touches upon the broader macroeconomic impact on crypto , particularly mentioning the potential for a resolution in the Ukraine conflict. While seemingly unrelated at first glance, geopolitical events can have significant ripple effects across global markets, including the cryptocurrency market. How could an armistice in Ukraine boost risk assets like Bitcoin? Reduced Uncertainty: Geopolitical tensions often create uncertainty in markets. A move towards peace could reduce this uncertainty, encouraging investors to take on more risk. Improved Global Sentiment: Positive global events tend to improve overall market sentiment, benefiting risk assets like Bitcoin. Capital Flow Shift: A more stable geopolitical landscape could lead to a shift in capital flows, potentially directing more investment towards growth-oriented assets like cryptocurrencies. While predicting geopolitical events is notoriously difficult, the analysis rightly points out that positive developments on the macroeconomic front could act as a significant catalyst for the crypto market growth and specifically for Bitcoin. It’s a reminder that the crypto market doesn’t operate in isolation and is influenced by broader global events. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what are the key takeaways from this analysis, and what actionable insights can you glean? Long-Term Perspective: The analysis reinforces the idea that Bitcoin investing is often a long-term game. Post-halving cycles historically play out over a period of time. Monitor Institutional Activity: Keep an eye on institutional investment trends, particularly companies like Strategy. Their actions can provide valuable signals. Stay Informed on Macro Events: Be aware of how macroeconomic and geopolitical events could impact the crypto market. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Given the potential for future growth but also market volatility, DCA can be a prudent strategy for accumulating Bitcoin over time. It’s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile and unpredictable. This analysis offers a perspective based on historical data and current market dynamics, but it’s not financial advice. Always conduct your own thorough research and consider your risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. Conclusion: The Bitcoin Journey Continues In conclusion, the analysis from oinonen_t paints a picture of continued potential for Bitcoin’s post-halving cycle. Fueled by historical patterns, strong institutional demand for Bitcoin , and potential macroeconomic tailwinds, the narrative suggests that the Bitcoin story is far from over. While technical corrections are always possible in the volatile crypto market, the underlying factors point towards further crypto market growth and potential upside for BTC price prediction .

Leading crypto analyst Ali Martinez has issued a stark warning, suggesting the highly anticipated altseason could vanish if Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, breaches a critical price level. This news has sent ripples through the crypto community, leaving investors wondering what’s next for their altcoin portfolios. Let’s dive into Martinez’s analysis and explore what this crucial $2,600 ETH price point means for the future of altcoins. Why is the $2.6K Ethereum Price Level a Make-or-Break Point for Altseason? Martinez’s analysis, shared on X, hinges on the pivotal role Ethereum plays in the broader altcoin market. Ethereum’s network is the backbone for a vast majority of altcoins, serving as their primary platform for development, trading, and functionality. Historically, a strong Ethereum performance has often paved the way for a thriving altseason, where alternative cryptocurrencies experience significant price surges and increased investor interest. Conversely, Ethereum’s weakness can cast a shadow over the entire altcoin landscape. Here’s why the $2,600 level is so critical according to market analysis: Psychological Support: The $2,600 mark represents a significant psychological support level for Ethereum. Breaching this level could trigger fear and uncertainty among investors, leading to further sell-offs. Technical Indicator: From a technical analysis perspective, a sustained break below $2,600 could signal a shift in market sentiment from bullish to bearish for Ethereum. This could be interpreted as a broader market correction signal. Altcoin Dependency: Altcoins are often more volatile and dependent on Ethereum’s strength. If ETH weakens, investors may become risk-averse and pull capital out of altcoins, exacerbating a potential downturn. Historical Precedent: Past market cycles have shown a correlation between Ethereum’s price movements and altcoin season. Ethereum leading the charge upwards has often been a precursor to altseason rallies. In essence, Martinez is suggesting that $2,600 isn’t just another price point for Ethereum; it’s a crucial line in the sand that could determine the fate of the anticipated altseason. A break below this level could indicate a deeper correction for ETH and, consequently, a delay or even cancellation of the altseason. Decoding the Analyst’s Warning: What Does This Mean for Your Altcoin Portfolio? So, what actionable insights can we glean from this crypto analyst’s warning? For altcoin investors, this news serves as a critical alert to closely monitor Ethereum’s price action. Here’s a breakdown of potential scenarios and recommended actions: Scenario Potential Impact on Altcoins Actionable Insights for Investors ETH Holds Above $2.6K Altseason potential remains alive. Continued ETH strength could fuel altcoin rallies. Maintain current altcoin positions, consider strategic accumulation if market conditions are favorable. ETH Breaks Below $2.6K (Briefly) Potential short-term altcoin dip. Market volatility likely to increase. Exercise caution, consider setting stop-loss orders to protect against further downside. Monitor market sentiment closely. ETH Breaks Below $2.6K (Sustained) Altseason highly unlikely. Deeper correction in altcoin values possible. Reduce altcoin exposure, consider hedging strategies, prepare for potential market downturn. Re-evaluate risk tolerance. It’s important to remember that market analysis, even from seasoned crypto analysts, is not foolproof. However, Martinez’s projection highlights a significant risk factor that altcoin investors should be aware of. Staying informed and adaptable is key in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Understanding Altseason: What Exactly is it and Why is Ethereum So Crucial? For those new to the crypto space, let’s quickly define “altseason.” Altseason, short for “alternative cryptocurrency season,” refers to a period in the cryptocurrency market when altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) experience significant price appreciation, often outperforming Bitcoin. This phenomenon is typically driven by a combination of factors, including: Bitcoin’s Dominance Cycle: After Bitcoin experiences a significant bull run, profits often rotate into altcoins as investors seek higher percentage gains in smaller-cap cryptocurrencies. Increased Risk Appetite: During bullish market phases, investors tend to have a higher risk appetite and are more willing to invest in altcoins, which are generally considered riskier than Bitcoin. Technological Advancements & Narratives: New technological developments, exciting project launches, and compelling narratives around specific altcoins can also fuel altseason rallies. Ethereum’s Ecosystem: As mentioned earlier, Ethereum’s robust ecosystem is a major driver of altcoin activity. Many promising altcoins are built on the Ethereum blockchain, and its overall health significantly impacts the altcoin market. Ethereum’s centrality to altseason stems from its role as the leading smart contract platform and the foundation for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). A healthy and vibrant Ethereum ecosystem is crucial for the growth and prosperity of the vast majority of altcoins. Therefore, any signs of weakness in Ethereum, such as a break below a critical price level like $2.6K, can have a cascading effect on the entire altcoin market. Navigating the Market Uncertainty: Beyond the $2.6K Ethereum Price Point While the $2.6K Ethereum price level is undoubtedly a critical threshold, it’s crucial to consider a broader market analysis to make informed investment decisions. Relying solely on one analyst’s prediction or a single price point can be limiting. Here are some additional factors to keep in mind: Overall Market Sentiment: Monitor broader market sentiment indicators, such as the Fear & Greed Index, Bitcoin’s price action, and macroeconomic factors. Ethereum Network Fundamentals: Assess Ethereum’s network activity, including transaction volume, gas fees, and developer activity. A strong and active network suggests underlying health. Altcoin Specific Catalysts: Research individual altcoins and identify potential catalysts that could drive their price, regardless of Ethereum’s short-term price movements. Risk Management Strategies: Implement robust risk management strategies, including diversification, position sizing, and stop-loss orders, to protect your portfolio in volatile market conditions. The cryptocurrency market is inherently dynamic and unpredictable. While analyst predictions like Martinez’s offer valuable insights, they should be used as one piece of the puzzle in your overall investment strategy. Staying informed, diversifying your research, and practicing sound risk management are essential for navigating the crypto landscape, regardless of whether altseason arrives or is temporarily delayed. Conclusion: Stay Vigilant and Prepared in the Face of Potential Market Shifts Ali Martinez’s warning about the $2.6K Ethereum price level and its implications for altseason serves as a crucial reminder of the interconnectedness and volatility of the cryptocurrency market. While the future remains uncertain, this analysis underscores the importance of vigilance and preparedness.

The Libra token got a huge burst of publicity when Argentina’s President Javier Milei posted on X.com about the project and then deleted his post. In the hours in between, LIBRA shot to a market cap of $4.4 billion and then collapsed after developers dumped their coins, extracting $107 million in liquidity while wiping out $4 billion in value and leaving investors with huge losses. Milei has been accused of fraud by lawyers, is facing a probe by an Argentine federal judge, and has been threatened with impeachment.

Coinbase, a major U.S.-based crypto exchange, has introduced new offerings for institutions in the jurisdiction. The exchange announced it had introduced CFTC-regulated futures for Solana (SOL) and Hedera (HBAR), citing the increasing demand for futures among U.S. investors. Coinbase exchange unveils CFTC-regulated Hedera and Solana futures through Coinbase Derivatives Coinbase Derivatives, LLC now offers CFTC-regulated futures for $SOL and $HBAR –bringing more institutional-grade crypto products to the U.S. futures market. pic.twitter.com/rLJz1bQGRA — Coinbase Institutional 🛡️ (@CoinbaseInsto) February 18, 2025 Coinbase Exchange announced that it will offer the new futures products through its Coinbase Derivatives, LLC (CDE), a U.S. CFTC-registered Designated Contract Market (DCM). According to the announcement, the exchange self-certified with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to list the futures contracts for Hedera (HBAR) and Solana (SOL). The exchange explained that the launch marked a new milestone representing the evolution of crypto derivatives’ regulations in the U.S. Coinbase highlighted that the new additions bring the total CDE futures contracts to 19 including the listings of Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, Stellar, and Gold. In mid-July last year, Coinbase Derivatives launched margined futures contracts for Avalanche (AVAX), Chainlink (LINK), Polkadot (DOT), Stellar (XLM), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Coinbase Derivatives said the contracts will give market participants a chance to manage risk, speculate on price movements, and invest with lower upfront capital requirements. The announcement detailed that the futures contracts are designed to have specific specifications inclined towards favoring market participants. These specifications include, 5 SOL per contract for Nano Solana Futures (SOL), 100 SOL per contract for Solana Futures (SLC), and 5000 HBAR per contract for Hedera Futures (HED). In August 2023, Coinbase Financial Markets, Inc. (CFM), a wholly owned Coinbase Global, Inc. subsidiary, received regulatory approval from the National Futures Association (NFA) to function as a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM). Since then, the exchange has extended its offerings to include crypto and traditional commodities contracts. The exchange also announced that its offerings will serve institutional investors by giving them access to regulated futures, including crypto and traditional commodities contracts. Coinbase’s announcement detailed that eligible institutions will now have access to futures trading through Coinbase Financial Markets, Inc. Coinbase argued that the platform will effectively bridge traditional finance and crypto, giving the market participants the necessary tools for effectively managing crypto risk and exposure through advanced trading strategies. Coinbase exchange unveils EURC-USDC perpetual futures for crypto traders In the same announcement, Coinbase exchange unveiled EURC-USDC perpetual futures to give traders seamless 24/7 access to Euro price exposure. The traditional foreign exchange (FX) market is among the largest and most liquid financial markets worldwide. The financial market boasts over $7.5 trillion in daily trading volume, and Coinbase seeks to be part of it. According to Coinbase exchange, EURC perpetual futures will offer an alternative to Foreign Exchange trading. The exchange announced that the offerings dictate a major milestone toward enabling traders to unlock value on crypto rails and decentralizing global finance. EURC-PERP will offer a leverage of up to 20x to increase capital efficiency for traders while simultaneously providing instant settlement. Coinbase exchange explained in a blog that EURC perpetual futures will not expire, thus allowing for continuous Euro price exposure without the need to roll contracts. The exchange’s blog also explained that Eligible non-U.S. institutions can trade EURC-PERP on Coinbase International Exchange while eligible non-U.S. retail investors can trade on Coinbase Advanced. Coinbase announced that it will continue to improve its derivatives offering with new contract listings, enhanced trading tools, and risk management features designed to meet the changing investor needs.

FloppyPepe (FPPE) , an AI token with cutting-edge AI technology and the viral appeal of meme culture is capturing attention with a potential return on investment that could surpass even the most successful meme coins of the past. Pepe (PEPE): Top Position Is Under Threat Pepe (PEPE) has long been a staple in the meme coin market, but it lacks the technological advancements for growth. While Pepe (PEPE) was a cultural phenomenon, the AI token narrative is gaining strength, and FloppyPepe (FPPE) is positioned to capitalize on this trend far better than Pepe (PEPE) ever could. Pepe (PEPE) is just riding on nostalgia, which means the potential for Pepe (PEPE) to grow is more dependent on consistent community-backed hype rather than technological advancement. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Future Of Meme Coins And AI Tokens FloppyPepe (FPPE) is taking the meme coin market by storm, building on the inspired legacy of Matt Furie, the creator of PEPE. This AI token doesn’t just embrace meme culture; it redefines it. By blending Furie’s artistic influence with advanced AI capabilities, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is set to outshine other tokens in the meme coin market in terms of utility and profitability. Unlike ordinary meme coins, FloppyPepe (FPPE) has introduced a unique AI ecosystem that includes FloppyX , a cutting-edge AI video agent that enables users to produce interactive video content using a sophisticated AI bot framework. This utility guarantees FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out in the AI token space. In addition, the project features Meme-o-Matic, a meme-generation AI tool that allows users to create viral content. Users can submit text prompts, video clips, and images, allowing the AI to generate viral memes in seconds, making it effortless for anyone to generate high-quality, engaging content. The buzz surrounding FloppyPepe (FPPE) is undeniable. In just 24 hours, the private round sold out at a staggering $907,200, proving that investors recognize its massive potential. The public presale is an opportunity to get in early at an astonishingly low price of $0.0000002 before the AI token skyrockets by an estimated 7,500%. This expected surge could see a $1,000 investment grow into $75,000, while a $5,000 investment could turn into $375,000 when FloppyPepe (FPPE) surges in 2025’s bullish meme coin market. For a meme coin to thrive, investors need a guarantee against rug pulls, and no better guarantee of security beats FloppyPepe’s (FPPE), multi-signature wallets , and bug bounty programs in the meme coin market. Furthermore, the project boasts a SolidProof- audited smart contract, so investors can rest assured that their funds are safe. Moreover, FloppyPepe (FPPE) employs a token burn mechanism , which mandates that 1% of the total supply is constantly removed to increase prices. The AI token sector is ascending; as CoinMarketCap’s AI tokens index shows, AI-powered cryptocurrencies are rapidly gaining traction. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is at the forefront of this movement, offering AI utilities that go beyond what any meme coin has done before. The AI ecosystem doesn’t stop there. In just two weeks, FloppyPepe (FPPE) will launch its text-to-image AI agent via its Telegram community, allowing early adopters to maximize its powerful technology before the masses catch on. This rapid development shows why this AI token is necessary in any crypto portfolio. Conclusion: Early Move To FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is Ideal The FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale is the opportunity of a lifetime. With the token currently priced at just $0.0000002 , early investors have the chance to secure massive gains before the price jumps by 7,500%. As the AI token sector explodes and the meme coin market continues its meteoric rise, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is positioned as the top project to watch. With its groundbreaking AI agents, strong security features, and community-driven approach, it’s only a matter of time before this AI token becomes the dominant force in the crypto space. Don’t wait until it’s too late. The greater PEPE is here, and it’s smarter and more profitable.

Analysts Weigh In,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/is-ethereum-quietly-building-momentum-for-a-rally-analysts-weigh-in/,"Ethereum’s recent price performance indicates a departure from the negative trends that are seen in the broader cryptocurrency market. While assets such as Bitcoin have faced downward pressure, Ethereum managed a slight positive move yesterday, pushing its market value back above $2,700. Amid this price move, questions have been raised about whether the asset might be quietly building momentum for a sudden rally. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms A Bullish Pattern – Expert Reveals Short-Term Price Target Quiet Moves Behind The Scenes Santiment, a well-regarded market intelligence platform has recently highlighted this price performance from ETH on X, noting that Ethereum has outpaced many altcoins at the start of the week. This performance as reported by Santiment may be attributed to the ongoing trend of ETH moving from exchanges into cold wallets at an accelerating rate. In fact, only 6.38% of the available supply remains on exchanges, the lowest figure since Ethereum’s inception, according to Santiment. Santiment also revealed that renewed interest from the ETH community appears to be another factor behind this momentum. 📈 Ethereum has shown mild signs of a rebound, currently back up to a market value of $2,745 and outpacing most altcoins to start the week.

Santiment’s analysis points to these movements as early indicators that Ethereum may be positioned for more sustained growth in the coming months. A Potential Upside for Ethereum and Altcoins Looking ahead, various market analysts have shared optimistic outlooks for Ethereum’s performance. Javon Marks, for example, sees ETH emerging from a lengthy consolidation phase. Related Reading: Altseason At Risk? Expert Believes Ethereum Must Hold $2,600 To Sustain Momentum According to Marks, the asset could potentially recover over 72% from its current levels, returning to its all-time high zones. Such a move might also spark significant bullish momentum for other altcoins, further enhancing Ethereum’s role as an altcoin market leader. Coming out of what may have only been a massive bottoming/consolidation, $ETH could be setting up here for an over +72.1% surge in a recovery back to its ATH areas!

However, the industry as a whole needs to more to become bullet proof, said TradFi experts at the ""Views From Wall Street to Crypto"" event held at Consensus Hong Kong on Wednesday. ""You have traditional players who have come into the space now, especially for us, most of our trading happens of exchange settlement, where you actually keep your assets on custodians while you are able to trade on exchanges,"" Gautam Sharma, CEO and CIO of Brevan Howard said. ""So the technology has come far ahead in terms of the last 18 months since then, [but] there's more work to do."" Sharma stressed the need for 24/7 risk management, including market, counterparty, and credit risks. Counterparty risk refers to the possibility of one party involved in a transaction failing to meet its obligation, resulting in a loss to the other party. This type of risk is higher in crypto than in traditional finance, given the absence of intermediaries such as banks or clearing houses that ensure trust and settlements, and it is a cause of concern for both directional and non-directional arbitration players. ""When we do arbitrage, the counterparty risk is the most important one,"" Fabio Frontini, founder of Abraxas Capital Management, said, adding that credit risk is also very important. Frontini stressed the importance of simulating stress testing scenarios, referring to the perpetual futures market where users can lose the margin when stopped out on a trade, which is not the case in traditional markets. ""It [stress testing] can be very rewarding, when done properly,"" Frontini added. Mike Kuehnel, CEO of the market-making firm Flow Traders, highlighted the need to make innovation transparent to win over investor confidence and ensure ""availability of data and moving liquidity without fragmentation around it."" ""Getting the best price and giving you the possibility to transact whenever you want to is a key ingredient,"" Kuehnel added. Liquidity, or the ability of the market to absorb large orders at stable prices, emerged as a significant concern following the collapse of FTX and its sister concern, Alameda.

His posts mention a “Trump effect” that appears to be guiding Ripple’s increased focus on the U.S. market, potentially driving up XRP’s value. This has generated excitement among market participants, especially in the XRP community. The article, titled “Ripple’s Garlinghouse Touts ‘Trump Effect’ Amid Bump in U.S. Deals,” discusses how Ripple, the company behind the cryptocurrency XRP, has seen a boost in its business opportunities in the U.S. since the 2024 election. It also includes insights from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who talks about the impact of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s actions on Ripple and how the “Trump bull market” is real. Many in the crypto community were quick to react to Trump’s post, especially given Ripple’s significant presence in the U.S. market. According to Garlinghouse, Ripple has signed more U.S. deals in the last few months of 2024 than during the previous half-year period, marking a shift toward more business growth stateside. This surge in U.S.-based operations was also highlighted by the fact that 75% of Ripple’s open roles are now U.S.-based, a stark contrast to the past few years, when most hiring was outside of the country. Link: https://t.co/PQLbHladMl — Good Morning Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) February 19, 2025 Ripple has had strong connections with Trump’s team, having donated to the Fair Shape PAC during the election, and Ripple executives have even met with Trump in the past. While it remains unclear exactly how much influence Trump has had on Ripple’s operations, the article shared by Trump could signal growing support for Ripple as the company continues to thrive in the U.S. market.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|XRP|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-19 03:51:48

Exploring Its Smart Contracts, Chargeback Defense, & $1.4M Presale",https://thecoinrise.com/is-web3bay-the-solution-to-e-commerce-fraud-exploring-its-smart-contracts-chargeback-defense-1-4m-presale/,"The digital shopping era has revolutionized global commerce, enabling consumers to buy products globally with unprecedented ease. Yet, this convenience has also introduced significant vulnerabilities. Online platforms are increasingly plagued by fraud, including deceptive listings, chargeback deceptions, and falsified reviews, eroding trust and causing financial detriment to both purchasers and vendors. A 2024 Juniper Research study forecasts that online payment fraud will inflict business losses exceeding $48 billion by 2025. Predominantly troubling is chargeback fraud, where customers falsely dispute receiving products to secure refunds. Concurrently, manipulated reviews sway consumer choices, blurring the lines between genuine merchants and fraudsters. While behemoths like Amazon and eBay have implemented certain checks, their centralized control exhibits intrinsic flaws. Blockchain technology offers a promising resolution, with Web3Bay at the vanguard of this innovative shift. How Web3Bay’s Smart Contracts Thwart Fraud Web3Bay harnesses the power of blockchain-based smart contracts to foster a trustless, transparent, and secure trading environment. These contracts automate and enforce agreements between parties, guaranteeing that transactions, from payment to delivery, are executed equitably and securely. Key Elements of Web3Bay’s Anti-Fraud Mechanism: Smart Contract Escrow: Funds are secured within a smart contract and released only after the buyer verifies receipt. In disputes, a neutral adjudication process assesses transaction data before releasing payments. Decentralized Identity Verification: Employing blockchain-based KYC protocols, Web3Bay authenticates seller identities, mitigating fraudulent profiles and counterfeit listings. Immutable Review System: Web3Bay records all user feedback on the blockchain, ensuring reviews are tamper-proof and transparent, thus fostering a more honest marketplace. Chargeback Protection: Leveraging blockchain payments, traditional chargebacks become infeasible. After a smart contract validates a transaction, the payment record becomes unalterable, nullifying illegitimate refund claims. These innovations directly tackle prevalent e-commerce challenges, bolstering confidence in transaction authenticity for both buyers and sellers. Web3Bay Presale & Market Forecast Web3Bay’s ongoing presale has captivated substantial investor interest, mirroring strong belief in its business model. By February 18, 2025, it has amassed over $1.4 million in Stage 5 of its presale, distributing over 350 million 3BAY tokens. Each presale stage has seen a 15% price increment, with an anticipated market entry price of $0.1959. Decentralized commerce, already a burgeoning $13 billion industry, continues to grow as consumers demand more secure and transparent dealings. Although competitors like OpenBazaar and Origin Protocol have explored similar avenues, they have faced hurdles in user adoption and liquidity. Web3Bay sets itself apart by fostering real-world merchant integration and emphasizing security with automated smart contracts. Moreover, the 3BAY token provides diverse functionalities, including governance, staking rewards, and marketplace incentives, attracting crypto investors seeking viable asset applications. Summing Up! With a presale that has exceeded expectations and increasing blockchain integration in e-commerce, Web3Bay is poised to redefine online retail security. By addressing fraud with smart contracts and indelible reviews, it offers a dependable alternative to traditional platforms. As it progresses towards a full launch, the platform’s scalability and merchant onboarding capabilities will be critical to its sustained success in redefining the decentralized market landscape.

The price is now trading below $2.650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.620 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

Among these emerging projects, some stand out for their unique offerings and massive potential. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), for instance, has been creating a stir with its growing presale excitement, while Zignaly and Chainlink have been evolving with innovative solutions. Arctic Pablo Coin is drawing attention with its community-driven approach and unique tokenomics, making it a standout among meme coins. Meanwhile, Zignaly continues to lead in decentralized trading with automated trading bots, while Chainlink remains a key player in blockchain infrastructure, providing secure and reliable oracles. If you’re on the hunt for popular crypto to buy, Arctic Pablo Coin is certainly a name to remember. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Zignaly, and Chainlink. Arctic Pablo Coin: Presale Explodes with Unmatched Excitement Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) has quickly positioned itself as one of the most exciting meme coins to emerge in the market. What makes this project so appealing is its engaging community and massive presale potential. The meme coin presale is currently progressing through several phases, and with each stage, the price per token increases significantly. Arctic Pablo Coin is currently in the Blizzard Bay phase (the 11th stage), where the price is set at just $0.000063. As a result, early investors have already seen an impressive ROI of 12,618.77% from Blizzard Bay to the projected listing price of $0.008. Maximize Your Returns: Earn 66% APY with Arctic Pablo Coin’s Staking During Presale Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) offers an exciting opportunity for investors with an impressive 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) during its presale phase. This feature allows early adopters to stake their tokens and earn substantial rewards as the project progresses. Staking with APC is an easy way for investors to not only secure their position in the presale but also take advantage of the growth potential of the coin. With the presale gaining momentum, the added benefit of staking provides an incentive for long-term commitment to the project. As the Arctic Pablo Coin presale continues to generate buzz, staking becomes a smart strategy to maximize returns. Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the popular crypto to buy right now, and the 66% APY offers a solid incentive for both short-term and long-term holders. Zignaly: Empowering Crypto Traders with Revolutionary Tools Zignaly is another project that has been gaining attention due to its unique approach to cryptocurrency trading. The current price of ZIGChain is $0.10 per token (ZIG/USD), with a market capitalization of approximately $150 million. Unlike typical meme coins, Zignaly focuses on providing advanced trading tools for users, which gives investors a competitive edge in the market. The platform offers copy trading, which allows users to copy the strategies of expert traders, and signal services that guide crypto traders to make smarter decisions. What sets Zignaly apart is its focus on making professional-grade tools accessible to everyone, from beginners to experienced traders. By partnering with well-known crypto influencers and market experts, Zignaly is quickly gaining a strong reputation in the crypto space. Investors can take advantage of Zignaly’s trading tools while also leveraging its native token as part of its reward system, making it an appealing investment for both traders and holders alike. The market for crypto trading platforms is growing rapidly, and with Zignaly’s innovative features, it has the potential to carve out a niche for itself. While not as explosive as Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale excitement, Zignaly’s steady growth and focus on providing value to users make it a solid investment for the long term. Chainlink: A Trusted Oracle Solution for DeFi and Smart Contracts Chainlink is a well-established name in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), offering a critical solution to smart contracts with its Oracle network. Oracles are essential for bringing real-world data to the blockchain, and Chainlink has solidified itself as one of the leading providers of this service. Chainlink is currently priced at $18.78.By connecting smart contracts with external data, Chainlink helps power a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols. Chainlink’s native token, LINK, is widely used within the DeFi ecosystem, and its real-world utility is one of the key factors behind its success. The project has formed partnerships with major players in the crypto industry, further validating its position as a leading oracle solution. As the demand for DeFi and smart contracts continues to grow, Chainlink is well-positioned to capture a larger share of the market. While Chainlink is a more established project compared to Arctic Pablo Coin and Zignaly, its ongoing development and strong partnerships make it an exciting asset in the crypto space. Investors who are looking for a more stable investment with established market potential may find Chainlink to be a worthwhile addition to their portfolios. Conclusion: Arctic Pablo Coin Shines Brightest Among Three When looking at the three projects— Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Zignaly, and Chainlink—each has its appeal, but it’s clear that Arctic Pablo Coin stands out with its massive presale potential and community-driven initiatives. While Zignaly offers unique tools for traders and Chainlink continues to strengthen its position in the DeFi space, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale excitement and rapid growth make it an incredible opportunity for investors looking to make substantial gains. If you’re searching for a popular crypto to buy, Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the best choices right now, with 1000X potential and a growing community. Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the popular crypto to buy today due to its rapidly increasing value and innovative community features. Don’t miss out on the chance to invest early before the price increases further. With each passing phase, the ROI potential grows, so now is the time to secure your share of Arctic Pablo Coin before it becomes the next big hit in the crypto world.

The regulatory agency has recently requested delays in both cases, signaling a shift in its crypto enforcement approach. Will US SEC Pause Ripple Lawsuit Next? According to an X post by former SEC official John Reed Stark, the agency may soon put its Ripple lawsuit on hold. Stark highlighted the SEC’s recent decisions to delay legal proceedings against Coinbase and Binance, suggesting that these moves indicate a broader change in enforcement strategy. On Friday, the SEC informed the Second Circuit Court that its new Crypto Task Force could lead to a resolution in its case against Coinbase. This prompted a request for a delay in responding to Coinbase’s appeal regarding whether securities laws apply to transactions on its platform. A similar joint motion was filed in the Binance case last week, requesting a two-month pause in proceedings. Stark emphasized that the SEC’s approach to crypto enforcement is changing, stating that the agency’s crypto-related unit has been rebranded from the “Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit” to the “Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit.” This restructuring suggests a potential slowdown or even a halt in SEC-led crypto investigations and litigation. SEC Crypto Cases Facing Pauses and Settlements The SEC has faced multiple legal challenges in its enforcement actions against major crypto firms, including Ripple, Coinbase, and Binance. However, recent developments indicate that the agency may be shifting away from aggressive litigation ahead of Paul Atkins taking charge of the agency. In the Coinbase case, the SEC and Coinbase jointly requested a delay in court proceedings, citing ongoing regulatory discussions. A similar request was made in the Binance case , where both parties agreed that a temporary pause was necessary while the SEC reevaluates its stance on digital assets. Stark suggested that these delays could lead to broader settlements or dismissals of crypto-related cases. He noted that the SEC’s approach under previous leadership focused on strict enforcement, but the recent changes signal a different direction. He also pointed out that key SEC trial lawyers previously leading these cases have been reassigned, further supporting the idea that the agency is stepping back from its earlier stance. Ripple Lawsuit Likely to Follow the Same Pattern With the SEC pausing its cases against Coinbase and Binance, legal experts believe that the Ripple lawsuit could face a similar fate. Attorney Jeremy Hogan has recently commented on the matter, stating that the SEC may settle its case against Ripple before approving an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). He suggested that a settlement was likely before any ETF approval, reinforcing speculation that the SEC is reconsidering its legal battles with crypto firms. Moreover, with the chances of an XRP ETF approval rising to 80% polymarket and the agency acknowledging three applications so far , the Ripple lawsuit end may be looming. The lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple has been a long-running legal dispute over whether XRP should be classified as a security. A partial court ruling in 2023 determined that XRP was not a security in certain transactions, but the SEC has continued to challenge this decision. If the SEC follows the same pattern as in the Coinbase and Binance cases, and the Elon Musk DOGE investigation on the agency continues, a pause or settlement in the Ripple lawsuit may soon follow.

People with claims exceeding $50,000 will have to wait a bit longer. Their repayments are set to begin in the second quarter of 2025. The key date to watch is April 11, when FTX will confirm claims over $50,000. The actual payouts for this group are scheduled for May 30. To receive funds, creditors must complete Know Your Customer (KYC) verification and submit necessary tax forms. If they miss the deadline, they can still qualify for later distributions. How Much Will Creditors Get? FTX’s recovery estimates suggest that total payouts could reach between $14.46 billion and $16.25 billion. The average recovery rate is projected to be between 123% and 138%, meaning some creditors might even receive more than their original claims. While all secured and customer claims are expected to be fully covered, the exact recovery amount varies due to factors like post-petition interest and remission fund recoveries. FTX’s Impact on Solana (SOL) Price FTX’s bankruptcy has also affected the Solana (SOL) market . The exchange has been offloading its SOL holdings, adding to selling pressure. Last week, its liquidation wallet sent SOL tokens to Binance, pushing prices lower. Additionally, an upcoming unlock of 11.2 million SOL, tied to FTX’s early investments, is expected to add further selling pressure. As a result, SOL’s price has dropped by 10% in a day, bringing it close to $160. With FTX continuing to sell assets, the Solana market remains under pressure.",News,EN,0,0,SOL|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-19 04:58:27

LIBRA, a Solana-based project that President of Argentina Javier Milei tweeted about on Feb. 14, saw its market cap rise as high as $4.5 billion and then fall more than 80% within a couple of hours as insiders cashed out, leaving many bag holders with massive losses. The story became an international and political incident over the weekend when in the last couple of days, Milei deleted his original tweet, denied his endorsement and accused the political opposition of mischief. This eventually led to talks of his impeachment and created uncertainty in the Argentinian stock market. Then came an explosive twist to the story. On Tuesday, CoinDesk broke the news that a key player behind the LIBRA token had bragged about buying access to Argentine President Javier Milei's inner circle months before the memecoin's scandalous launch and crash. Although these kinds of kerfuffle for a memecoin are not unusual, how this happened and what followed after the apparent ""rug pull"" highlighted the risk of unchecked crypto trading and the potential for a reputational hit for the memecoin sector as a whole. ""The LIBRA episode represents what is a potential point of oversaturation for the memecoin space,"" said Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial. ""At this point, the novelty of new projects, after TRUMP and MELANIA, and now LIBRA, has largely worn off."" ""Additionally, the reputational consequences for these assets may be significant. Having said that, it appears that this episode is likely to continue playing out as new details emerge. At this point, memecoins are synonymous with ‘pump and dump’ schemes,"" FRNT contended. This incident, along with other memecoin-related events that led to many retail traders losing money, may nudge the community to make more of an effort to police itself. ""The entire $LIBRA memecoin fiasco over the weekend should serve as a reminder that all of us in the DeFi community have a responsibility to make this space safer for users,"" said Chris Chung, founder of Solana-based swap platform Titan. How the 'fiasco' happened The whole Milei and LIBRA episode played out within the span of a few days, starting on Feb. 14. As explained by Galaxy Research's Alex Thorn, the token launched on that fateful day on a Solana-based DeX Meteora, with Milei's initial post (now deleted) on social media platform X saying that the aim of the token was to help the growth of the Argentinian economy — a big endorsement for a memecoin. Once the token price reached its peak of $4.4 billion within hours, the insiders started dumping their holdings immediately, making nearly $100 million, according to onchain analysts. The next day, Milei deleted his original post, sending a shockwave within the memecoin community, that saw many similar tokens, such as TRUMP, MILANIA, and others, sell out fast. Meanwhile, Solana, the blockchain the token was built on, also saw its native token, SOL, fall. In his new post, Milei claimed he wasn't aware of the details of the project and accused the political opposition of mischief, making the situation a game of politics. By that time, the token had erased around $4.5 billion of retail capital in seven hours. Currently, the market cap sits around just above half a million, according to CoinMarketCap data . The same day, names of a few key opinion leaders (KOL) came up, including Barstool’s Dave Portnoy, Threadguy, Hayden Davis and Faze Banks, who were involved in one way or another with the project. Portnoy said he was an early investor and was refunded his money, further spreading the controversy that insiders benefitted from the LIBRA fiasco. Davis, meanwhile, revealed that he was behind both the LIBRA and MELANIA memecoins and said the Argentinian token incident was ""not a rug pull ,"" rather ""It's just a plan gone miserably wrong."" The next day, the Argentinian opposition threatened Milei with impeachment over the incident. On Feb. 17, Ben Chow, co-founder of DeX Meteora, where LIBRA had launched, resigned over the controversy. Chow was also a co-founder of Solana-based trading aggregator Jupiter. The same day Argentina's stock market collapsed almost 6% on a report of a probe on Milei. Read more: LIBRA Apparent Rug Pull Is Latest 'Sordid Episode' Emerging From Solana's Memecoin Complex: Galaxy On Feb. 18, CoinDesk broke the news that Davis claimed in text messages that he could ""control"" Milei because of payments he had been making to Karina Milei, a powerful figure in Milei's government, and the president's sister. 'Setback for crypto' What will happen to Milei and all the involved parties is still unknown. However, if FTX's spectacular blowout is anything to go by, there might still be a lot more to untangle in this story. What it does highlight is that the memecoin drama that has become a game of split-second profit and losses, in this cycle, might be at a crossroads. As institutional investors are betting big on bitcoin and ether with the launch of exchange-traded funds, making those assets more TradFi friendly and stable, the memecoin sector has stuck out as the ugly duckling of the crypto space, and this incident may sour retail participation. ""Overall, this entire story is a real setback for the crypto space,"" Chung said. ""If we want to attract new retail users, this is not the way to do it.""",Finance|Javier milei|Memecoin|Argentina|market analysis,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-19 04:59:27

Despite strong network activity and continued developer interest, SOL’s short-term performance has left some investors cautious. While Solana experiences a pullback, some traders are looking for new opportunities with higher growth potential. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction, raising over $680,000 in its presale phase this week. The project’s decentralized lending platform and structured tokenomics have attracted early investors looking for substantial returns. With strong demand and ongoing development, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a standout option for those seeking long-term gains in 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) As Solana faces a pullback, investors are turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi project that is already making waves in its presale phase. With over $680,000 raised this week alone, the strong demand for MUTM reflects growing confidence in its long-term potential. Unlike speculative tokens, Mutuum Finance is built on real utility, offering a decentralized lending and borrowing platform that allows users to earn passive income while accessing liquidity without intermediaries. One of the key advantages of Mutuum Finance is its ability to generate sustainable rewards through its lending system. Users who supply assets to the platform receive mtTokens, such as mtUSDT or mtDAI, which accrue interest over time. This model not only benefits lenders with a steady yield but also provides borrowers with a transparent and efficient way to access funds without relying on centralized financial institutions. Mutuum Finance has structured its tokenomics to support long-term price growth and investor rewards. A portion of platform fees will be used to repurchase MUTM tokens, which will then be distributed to mtToken stakers. This buy-and-distribute mechanism ensures continuous demand for MUTM, encouraging long-term holding and increasing the token’s value over time. Additionally, the project is working on an overcollateralized stablecoin, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar on the Ethereum network. This stablecoin will provide users with a reliable way to borrow and transact within the Mutuum ecosystem, reinforcing the platform’s real-world use cases and increasing adoption. With the presale already surpassing $680K and over 1,070 holders participating, investors are securing MUTM at its lowest price of $0.01 before it moves to the next phase at $0.015. Early buyers stand to benefit from substantial returns as the token progresses through its 11 presale phases, leading up to its exchange listing. Experts predict that with the growing investor interest, ongoing development, and planned beta launch of the lending platform, MUTM will experience significant price appreciation post-launch. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a well-structured tokenomics model, with a large portion allocated to the presale, offering early investment opportunities. Other allocations support liquidity, ecosystem development, partnerships, and community incentives. To drive long-term engagement, a share of tokens is dedicated to liquidity mining rewards, benefiting mtToken stakers within the lending platform. Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway to reward early supporters and boost community engagement. Ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, giving them a chance to benefit from the project’s growth before its official launch. Full participation details and rules can be found on the official Mutuum Finance website. As Solana faces short-term volatility, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a promising alternative with a strong foundation in DeFi. With its innovative lending model, structured tokenomics, and increasing investor demand, MUTM is positioning itself as one of the most attractive investment opportunities in 2025.

This new initiative aims to facilitate cross-chain token transfers and message-passing, enhancing the functionality and integration of various blockchain networks. Polygon Market Cap Rebounds To $3.8 Billion According to market intelligence firm Messari, by leveraging zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, Agglayer promises secure communication and asset transfers, positioning itself as an innovative development akin to the introduction of TCP/IP in the early days of the internet. Agglayer is designed to unify disparate blockchain chains by aggregating proofs, verifying chain states, and settling transactions on Ethereum (ETH). Among its critical features are a unified bridge for seamless asset connectivity and a pessimistic proof mechanism that prioritizes safety. These advancements enable low-latency coordination and safe interoperability, allowing developers to concentrate on project design without the burdens of liquidity concerns. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Accumulate—Will This Push BTC Toward $100K? Despite these promising developments, POL’s journey in 2024 has been turbulent. After achieving an all-time high market capitalization of $12.9 billion in Q1, the subsequent quarters saw a sharp decline, with the market cap plummeting to $2.9 billion by the end of Q3, marking a 47.2% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) drop. This downturn was partly due to the ongoing transition from MATIC to POL, which temporarily split market capitalization between the two tokens. However, as market conditions began to stabilize in Q4, the migration of MATIC tokens—1.38 billion in total—into POL resulted in a 31% QoQ increase in POL’s market capitalization, which reached $3.8 billion by the end of the quarter. Notably, 88.1% of the total supply had transitioned to POL, solidifying its position as the largest Ethereum Layer-2 token by market cap. DeFi And NFT Markets Struggle The enactment of EIP-4844 on the Polygon PoS mainnet in Q1 2024 introduced blobs, leading to a significant alteration in the cost structure for users. This update resulted in lower transaction fees, which dropped to just $0.01 during Q4. However, despite the reduced costs, total transactions on the Polygon network fell by 2% QoQ, and active addresses saw a sharp decline of 39.4%, averaging 523,000 daily users. The decrease in activity can be largely attributed to a downturn in the gaming sector, which had previously been a significant driver of user engagement. Average daily gaming active addresses plummeted to 54,000, marking a 66.7% QoQ decline. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Falls Short Again—Is a Deeper Decline Coming? Polygon’s DeFi landscape also faced challenges, with total value locked (TVL) ending Q4 at $871.5 million—down 4.9% QoQ and 2.6% YoY. This decline saw Polygon slip from the tenth largest network by TVL to the twelfth. Moreover, NFT activity on the platform suffered, with average daily trading volume falling to $822,500, down 38.4% QoQ. Average daily NFT sales dropped to 21,000, a staggering 41.5% decrease. The gaming sector, previously the fastest-growing area within Polygon, continued to struggle in Q3 and Q4, largely due to a slowdown in popular titles. POL’s price has also faced notable challenges, with the token recording a significant 67% drop year-to-date as it currently trades at $0.30.

Unlike traditional online casinos that operate with fiat currencies, Bitcoin casinos leverage blockchain technology for faster, more secure, and private transactions. These platforms offer the same exciting games you’d find in traditional casinos—slots, poker, blackjack, roulette, and even live dealer games—while integrating the advantages of cryptocurrency. Why Bitcoin Casinos Are Worth Trying 1. Anonymity and Privacy One of the biggest advantages of Bitcoin casinos is privacy. Unlike traditional casinos that require extensive personal information for registration, many Bitcoin casinos only require an email address and a Bitcoin wallet. This level of anonymity is ideal for players who value their privacy. 2. Fast Transactions Forget waiting for hours or days for deposits and withdrawals. Bitcoin transactions are near-instant, allowing players to fund their accounts and cash out winnings in minutes. 3. Lower Fees Traditional payment methods often come with hefty processing fees. Bitcoin transactions typically have minimal or no fees, ensuring that players keep more of their winnings. 4. Global Access Bitcoin casinos are available worldwide, bypassing many of the restrictions imposed by traditional banking systems. This makes gambling accessible to players in regions with strict regulations. 5. Provably Fair Gaming Blockchain technology ensures transparency in gaming. Many Bitcoin casinos offer provably fair games, allowing players to verify the fairness of every bet they place—something rarely available in traditional casinos. A World of Games at Your Fingertips Bitcoin casinos provide a vast selection of games, from classic slots to blackjack, roulette, and poker. Many also feature live dealer games, where players interact with real dealers in real time. Some platforms even introduce unique blockchain-based games, offering a fresh experience exclusive to cryptocurrency users. Bonuses and Promotions Bitcoin casinos are known for their generous bonuses and promotions, often surpassing what traditional casinos offer. Welcome Bonuses : Many Bitcoin casinos match a percentage of your initial deposit. Free Spins : Additional chances to play without extra investment. VIP & Loyalty Programs : Exclusive rewards for regular players. Cashback Offers : Some platforms provide refunds on losses, giving players more chances to win. Safety and Security Security is a top priority for Bitcoin casinos. These platforms use blockchain technology to secure transactions and prevent tampering. Additionally, reputable casinos implement encryption and other security measures to protect player accounts. To ensure a safe experience, always choose a licensed Bitcoin casino with positive user reviews and provably fair games. Managing Bitcoin’s Volatility Bitcoin’s price can be volatile. While this can lead to increased winnings, it also introduces risk. To manage this, players can convert winnings into stablecoins or fiat currency to protect against sudden price fluctuations. How to Get Started with Bitcoin Casinos Starting with a Bitcoin casino is simple. Here’s how: Set Up a Bitcoin Wallet – Choose a reliable wallet like Coinbase, Exodus, or Ledger. Buy Bitcoin – Purchase Bitcoin through an exchange or peer-to-peer platform. Choose a Bitcoin Casino – Select a reputable casino with good reviews and licensing. Create an Account – Most Bitcoin casinos only require an email for registration. Deposit Bitcoin – Transfer Bitcoin from your wallet to the casino. Start Playing – Explore games, claim bonuses, and enjoy! The Future of Bitcoin Gambling As cryptocurrency adoption grows, Bitcoin casinos are set to become even more popular. Innovations such as decentralized gambling platforms and multi-cryptocurrency support (Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin) are already shaping the future of the industry. By joining a Bitcoin casino now, you’re not just gambling—you’re experiencing the future of online gaming. Why Now Is the Time Bitcoin casinos combine privacy, security, and innovation like no traditional casino can. With fast transactions, generous bonuses, and a vast selection of games, there’s no better time to start. If you’re curious about Bitcoin casinos, now is the perfect time to explore.

These filings mark a major milestone for the cryptocurrency, as the application was previously rejected or withdrawn. In the past, attempts to file for an ETF were met with resistance, especially during the era under SEC Chair Gary Gensler. However, the acknowledgment of these filings is seen as a positive sign, showing that the SEC is open to considering altcoins like XRP and Solana in a way they haven’t before. In a recent podcast, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas said that this development is very important because it suggests that these cryptocurrencies may no longer be classified as securities by the SEC, which would be a game-changer. He quoted someone who speculated that this could eventually lead to the reconsideration of related lawsuits, signaling a shift in how these cryptocurrencies are treated under U.S. law. Litecoin ETF Approval By October 2025? Balchunas also discussed the potential for other altcoins like Dogecoin and Cardano to follow suit, with some filings already underway. While the SEC’s acknowledgment is an encouraging sign, there is still uncertainty about when a final decision will be made. The probability of approval for these ETFs stands at about 70% for XRP. However, he touted Litecoin as one of the most important filings, as it is similar to Bitcoin and viewed as a commodity. Litecoin was filed during the SEC’s previous leadership under Gary Gensler, and unlike other applications, it didn’t receive a call to withdraw, giving it an advantage. With the current, more flexible SEC, Eric believes Litecoin has a 90% chance of approval, with a decision expected by October. While the future of XRP and Solana ETFs is still up in the air, the recent movements indicate that the landscape for cryptocurrency-related financial products is changing, with more filings and decisions expected in the coming months.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,LTC|XRP|REGULATION|SOL|ADA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-19 05:27:26

Stark explained on X that the agency’s broader shift in crypto enforcement strategy signals a fundamental change in its approach, potentially leading to the withdrawal of multiple ongoing cases. SEC’s Changing Stance on Crypto Enforcement Recent developments indicate that the SEC’s enforcement efforts against major cryptocurrency firms are being reassessed. On Friday, the SEC informed the Second Circuit that its newly formed Crypto Task Force may facilitate a resolution in its case against Coinbase, leading the agency to request a brief delay in responding to Coinbase’s appeal. The SEC’s motion cited the need for additional time to conduct an appropriate review of crypto-related issues, suggesting a potential softening of its legal battles against digital asset firms. This move follows a similar request in the Binance case , where the SEC and the crypto exchange jointly asked a federal judge in Washington, D.C., to stay the case for two months. The agency’s newly created task force is expected to play a key role in digital asset regulation, which could directly impact pending litigation. Implications for the Ripple Appeal With the SEC effectively pausing cases against Coinbase and Binance, Stark predicts that the agency will take the same approach with its appeal against Ripple. He believes all crypto-related litigation, including the Ripple appeal, will be put on hold or withdrawn entirely. Stark also pointed to internal shifts within the SEC as further evidence of its changing priorities. Notably, Jorge Tenreiro, a lead litigator in high-profile crypto cases, has been reassigned , signaling a potential retreat from aggressive enforcement actions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, Stark noted that the SEC’s specialized Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit has been rebranded as the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit, further suggesting a shift in focus. New Leadership and Strategic Recalibration The recent changes come in the wake of Mark Uyeda’s appointment as the SEC’s acting chairman on January 20. Under his leadership, the agency appears to be reevaluating its regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies. The creation of the Crypto Task Force and the agency’s willingness to pause major enforcement actions, suggests a shift toward regulatory clarity rather than litigation. Stark predicts that the SEC will significantly scale back its crypto-related enforcement efforts. He expects formal and informal investigations to slow, active litigation to be paused or settled on favorable terms for crypto firms, and ongoing appeals, such as the one against Ripple, to be dropped altogether. He wrote, “The SEC crypto-enforcement is as dead as Julius Caesar.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

RTX Surpasses $12M In Fastest Growing ICO This Year,https://timestabloid.com/could-pepe-sink-back-below-1b-or-is-it-still-destined-for-100b/,"The world of cryptocurrencies is changing, and a fresh PayFi solution is driving it. Although meme coins like PEPE offer conflicting signals, one project that is attracting major interest for its simplicity, speed, and practicality of use of cryptocurrencies. This is the finest coin to invest now with minimal fees, easy transfers, and the possibility to turn over more than forty cryptocurrencies into FIAT . This is a project you want not to miss as analysts forecast a significant increase. PEPE News has even highlighted this shift as a key opportunity in the crypto space. PEPE News: A Big Price Move Ahead? With PEPE displaying an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which could cause a 23% price swing, right now, the token trades for $0.000012 (breakout level) between $0.000008 (support). Should it pass muster, a significant action might follow. Whale activity, though, is producing conflicting indications. Over the past month, big investors raised their holdings by 103.64%; however, short-term whale trading has slumped by 45.77%. This implies some doubt among major players. According to @ali_charts , $0.0000092 is a crucial level for PEPE. If it holds above this level, a rebound could follow. But a break below may open the door for a move toward $0.0000032. Additionally, reducing down market participation is active wallet use, which dropped over 50%, while new wallet creation dropped by 31.72%. Fewer traders interacting with PEPE may hamper its momentum. PEPE’s market capitalization is currently hovering at $3.79 Billion, and its next action will be vital since meme currencies deal with liquidity issues. According to PEPE News , it’s unclear whether the pattern will break through or be hindered by declining activity.

The exchange has announced the removal of five spot trading pairs as part of its regular market review. This change, set to take effect on February 21, 2025, at 03:00 (UTC) where applicable, is aimed at keeping the platform efficient and user-friendly. To mitigate the investor losses such actions are taken regularly by Binance Binance - binance@miceneurol.com Centralised Exchange Cryptocurrencies Trading App Cryptocurrency investment Binance to Remove These Trading Pairs According to Binance, the affected spot trading pairs include, DOGS/BRL, FET/BRL, NEIRO/BRL, NEIRO/EUR, and NOT/EUR. Although these trading pairs will be removed, Binance has clarified that users can still trade these tokens through other active pairs on the platform. For instance, even if a pair like DOGS/BRL is delisted, users can continue trading DOGS and BRL using other available options. For traders using any of the affected pairs, this early notice allows ample time to adjust trading strategies and ensure a smooth transition before February 21st. Fiat Clarification The exchange also clarified that BRL and EUR are fiat currencies and do not represent any digital assets. This means that while these specific pairs are being removed, the affected tokens can still be traded against other cryptocurrencies . Why Binance Removing the Pairs Binance is removing these trading pairs as part of its regular market reviews, likely due to low trading volume and liquidity. When activity is too low, trading becomes inefficient, affecting the overall market experience. While Binance didn’t specify the exact reason, the exchange regularly updates its offerings to ensure a smooth and effective trading environment, keeping only the most viable pairs available. This move aligns with Binance’s goal of maintaining a high-quality market for its users. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Big News: Binance Rejects ‘Sale’ Rumors, Claims Smear Campaign by Rival Exchanges , Impact on Spot Trading Bots The exchange has also announced that Spot Trading Bots services will no longer support these trading pairs after the delisting.

40528215,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=130418,1739943295,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent NZD/USD Forecast: UOB Group Predicts Potential Surge to 0.5790,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/nzd-usd-forecast-potential-surge/,"Is the New Zealand Dollar poised for a powerful surge against the US Dollar? Top analysts at UOB Group suggest exactly that, highlighting a potential climb for NZD/USD to 0.5790. For crypto enthusiasts and Forex traders alike, understanding these traditional market movements can offer crucial insights into broader financial trends and risk assessment. Let’s delve into this exciting Forex forecast and uncover what it means for your trading strategy. Decoding the NZD/USD Forecast: What’s Driving the Optimism? UOB Group’s FX analysts, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, have laid out a compelling case for continued NZD strength. Their analysis, rooted in price action observation, points towards an upward trajectory for the New Zealand Dollar against its US counterpart. This bullish NZD/USD forecast isn’t just a shot in the dark; it’s based on meticulous market observation and trend analysis. But what are the key elements supporting this positive NZD outlook ? Consistent Price Action: The analysts emphasize that recent price movements strongly indicate sustained NZD strength. This isn’t a fleeting moment, but rather a pattern suggesting a continued upward trend. Technical Support Levels: Crucially, the NZD/USD forecast hinges on maintaining levels above a ‘strong support’ point, currently identified at 0.5675. As long as this level holds, the bullish outlook remains intact. Momentum Buildup: To reach the ambitious target of 0.5790, the NZD needs to sustain and build upon its current momentum. This requires consistent positive price action in the coming days and weeks. While the long-term view is decidedly bullish, UOB Group also provides a nuanced short-term perspective, crucial for day-to-day trading decisions. Navigating the Short-Term: Daily Trading Range for NZD/USD In the immediate 24-hour view, UOB Group anticipates a period of range-bound trading for NZD/USD . After an initial attempt to reach 0.5750, which fell slightly short, the currency pair is expected to settle into a more predictable pattern. What does this mean for traders? Expected Trading Range: For today, anticipate NZD/USD to fluctuate between 0.5710 and 0.5745. This narrower range suggests less volatility in the very short term. Range Trading Strategy: Traders can potentially capitalize on this range-bound movement by employing range trading strategies, buying near the support level (0.5710) and selling near the resistance level (0.5745). Monitor Support and Resistance: Keeping a close watch on these levels is vital. A break outside this range could signal a shift in momentum and require adjustments to trading strategies. Here’s a quick summary of the expected trading ranges from UOB Group: Timeframe Expected Range Key Levels 24-Hour View 0.5710 – 0.5745 Support: 0.5710, Resistance: 0.5745 1-3 Weeks View Potentially up to 0.5790 Strong Support: 0.5675, Target: 0.5790 Actionable Insights: How to Leverage the NZD/USD Forecast So, how can traders and investors use this Forex forecast to their advantage? Whether you are trading traditional Forex pairs or exploring the crypto markets, understanding these insights can refine your approach. For Forex Traders: Consider setting limit orders within the anticipated 24-hour range for short-term gains. For a medium-term strategy, monitor if NZD/USD holds above 0.5675 and look for opportunities to enter positions targeting 0.5790. For Crypto Traders: While seemingly distant from crypto, Forex markets often reflect broader economic sentiment. A strengthening NZD against the USD could indicate a general risk-on sentiment in the markets, which can sometimes correlate with positive movements in cryptocurrency markets. Keep an eye on overall market sentiment alongside this UOB Group NZD/USD analysis. Risk Management is Key: Remember, all forecasts are probabilities, not guarantees. Always employ robust risk management strategies, including stop-loss orders, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. The disclaimer from Bitcoin World reminds us to conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved. Challenges and Considerations: Is the 0.5790 Target a Sure Thing? While the NZD outlook is positive, it’s crucial to acknowledge potential challenges and factors that could influence this Forex forecast . No market movement is guaranteed, and various global economic factors can impact currency valuations. Global Economic Events: Unexpected shifts in global economic conditions, such as changes in US monetary policy, New Zealand economic data releases, or geopolitical events, could alter the trajectory of NZD/USD . Market Sentiment Shifts: Overall market sentiment can be fickle. A sudden shift to risk-off mode could strengthen the USD and potentially hinder the NZD’s upward movement. Data Dependency: The forecast is based on current price action and analysis. Future economic data releases from both New Zealand and the US will be critical in validating or invalidating this NZD/USD forecast . Conclusion: Staying Ahead with Informed Forex Analysis The NZD/USD forecast from UOB Group presents an exciting potential opportunity for traders. With a clear target of 0.5790 and defined support levels, it provides a framework for strategic trading decisions. By understanding both the short-term range and the longer-term bullish outlook, traders can better navigate the Forex markets. Remember to stay informed, manage your risk effectively, and continuously adapt your strategies as market conditions evolve. Keep an eye on the dynamic world of Forex and how these movements can offer broader insights into the global financial landscape, potentially even influencing the crypto markets you’re engaged in.

Recently, movements in traditional commodity markets, like copper, can offer insightful signals. Today, we’re diving into the **copper market** as it experiences a significant retreat from recent highs. This isn’t just about metal prices; it’s about global trade dynamics, potential inflation impacts, and what these shifts might foreshadow for the cryptocurrency landscape. Why are Copper Prices Retreating from Three-Month Highs? After hitting a three-month peak, **copper prices** on the London Metal Exchange (LME) have started to pull back. This correction is not happening in isolation; it’s a reaction to a confluence of factors, primarily centered around potential US tariffs and shifts in market dynamics. Let’s break down the key elements: Easing of Backwardation: The benchmark cash-to-three-month spread on the LME, which briefly flipped into backwardation (where spot prices are higher than future prices) for the first time since June 2023, has now eased back into contango (where future prices are higher than spot prices). This shift indicates a change in immediate supply tightness perceptions. Short-Covering and Contract Expiry: According to ING commodity analysts Warren Patterson and Ewa Manthey, short-covering ahead of LME contract expiry, fueled by expectations of US tariffs on copper, triggered a sharp movement in the **copper market** spread last week. This was a temporary squeeze that is now unwinding. US Tariff Threats Looming: Former US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on copper, following similar announcements on aluminum and steel, is a significant driver. While implementation might take time, the mere threat is reshaping market expectations. The Tariff Effect: How US Policy Impacts Global Copper Flow The potential US tariffs are not just a domestic issue; they have ripple effects across the global **commodity prices** landscape. Here’s how: Anticipation of US Market Tightness: The tariff threat is creating an expectation of temporary tightness within the US copper market. Traders are incentivized to move copper from global LME warehouses to the US to capitalize on arbitrage opportunities. Record Premium Surge: The premium for US Comex copper futures over LME contracts skyrocketed to a record high last week, exceeding $1,200 per tonne at one point – over 10% of the LME price. This dramatic surge underscores the market’s immediate reaction to tariff fears. Although this premium has since moderated to above $900, it remains historically elevated. US Import Dependence: The United States relies heavily on imports for its copper consumption, with approximately 45% sourced from abroad. Chile (35%) and Canada (26%) are the primary suppliers. Tariffs would directly impact these import flows and potentially increase costs for US consumers and industries. Bearish Implications: Tariffs, Slowing Growth, and Inflation While seemingly targeted at specific metals, these tariffs carry broader macroeconomic implications that could be bearish for **copper prices** and other industrial metals. Consider these factors: Slowing Global Growth: The backdrop to these trade tensions is a global economy already facing headwinds. Growth in the US is anticipated to slow down partly due to the impact of tariffs. China, a major consumer of copper, is also struggling to reignite its economic engine. Weakened Demand: With economic slowdowns in major economies, the demand for industrial metals like copper is likely to weaken. Copper is a key indicator of economic health due to its widespread use in construction, manufacturing, and technology. Inflationary Pressures: Paradoxically, while tariffs can dampen demand in the long run, they can also contribute to keeping inflation higher for longer in the short to medium term by increasing import costs. This complex interplay adds uncertainty to the economic outlook. LME Copper and the Contango Shift: What Does It Mean? The shift of the LME spread back to contango is a technical but crucial detail. What does it signify for the **LME copper** market? Market Condition Description Implication for Copper Prices Backwardation Spot price higher than future price Indicates immediate supply shortage and strong near-term demand, potentially pushing prices higher in the short term. Contango Future price higher than spot price Suggests ample current supply or expectations of weaker near-term demand, potentially putting downward pressure on spot prices. Also encourages storage as future delivery is more profitable. The return to contango suggests that the immediate tightness in the **LME copper** market, driven by short-covering and tariff anticipation, is easing. This could signal a period of price consolidation or further downward pressure, especially if fundamental demand weakens. Commodity Prices and Cryptocurrency: Are There Connections? While seemingly distinct, commodity markets and cryptocurrency markets are increasingly interconnected. Here’s how events in the **commodity prices** sector, like the copper market retreat, can be relevant to crypto investors: Economic Sentiment Indicator: Commodity prices, particularly industrial metals like copper, are often viewed as leading indicators of economic health. A downturn in copper prices can signal broader economic concerns, which can influence investor sentiment across all markets, including cryptocurrencies. Inflation Hedge Narrative: Both commodities and cryptocurrencies are sometimes considered as potential hedges against inflation. However, the effectiveness of each can vary. If tariffs contribute to ‘stagflation’ (slow growth with high inflation), the response in both commodity and crypto markets could be complex and not always move in perfect tandem. Risk-On/Risk-Off Dynamics: In periods of economic uncertainty driven by trade tensions or slowing growth, investors may shift their risk appetite. Both commodity and cryptocurrency markets can experience volatility during these periods as investors reallocate assets based on perceived risk and opportunity. Navigating Market Uncertainty: Key Takeaways for Investors The current situation in the copper market highlights the interconnectedness of global trade, economic policy, and market sentiment. For investors, particularly those in the cryptocurrency space, here are some crucial takeaways: Monitor Macroeconomic Signals: Pay attention to developments in traditional markets like commodities, as they can provide early warnings or confirmations of broader economic trends that will eventually impact all asset classes, including crypto. Understand Tariff Impacts: Tariffs are not just about specific goods; they are macroeconomic policy tools with wide-ranging consequences for trade flows, inflation, and economic growth. Analyze potential tariff impacts on various sectors and markets. Diversification and Risk Management: In times of uncertainty, diversification across asset classes remains a sound strategy. Be mindful of risk management and adjust portfolio allocations based on your risk tolerance and market outlook. Final Thoughts: Copper’s Dip as a Macro Warning? Copper’s retreat from three-month highs, driven by tariff threats and evolving market dynamics, serves as a potent reminder of the complexities facing the global economy. While the immediate focus is on the **copper market**, the underlying forces at play – trade tensions, growth concerns, and inflationary pressures – have far-reaching implications. For cryptocurrency investors, keeping an eye on these traditional market signals is crucial for navigating the ever-changing economic landscape and making informed investment decisions.

Note this is an authorized but not issued transaction, meaning that this amount will be used as inventory for next period issuance requests and chain swaps.” – Paolo Ardoino , CEO at Tether. Tether’s new mint pushed its USDT supply to over $140 billion, with most of it being on Ethereum ($76.9B) and TRON ($61.7B). Paolo Ardoino, Tether CEO, revealed the company’s attestation for Q4 2024, which indicated that Tether garnered $13.7 billion in profits for the year 2024. The company also gained ~$6 billion in profits for Q4 2024 and $113 billion in direct and indirect holdings. The report also highlighted that the company issued $23 billion USDT in Q4 2024. Ardiono added that Tether had a total issuance of $45 billion USDT for year 2024, which represented almost the entire market cap of the second largest stablecoin. The firm also acknowledged that its USDT reached an impressive milestone of 400 million users globally who were mostly distributed among emerging markets and developing countries. Tether had $7 billion in its excess stablecoin reserves in 2024, which was a 36% increase year over year. According to Ardiono, the Tether Group proprietary equity also surged past $20 billion. Data also showed that Circle resumed USDC minting on Solana after a 7-day pause. The firm has minted a total of $6B USDC on Solana in January and $1.5B in February. SpotOnChain also said that the 7-day break was the longest pause for Circle since previous mints were only up to 4 days apart. The additional $250M USDC is part of Circle’s ongoing efforts to expand the reach and utility of its stablecoin across various blockchain platforms. The firm has been minting several batches of $250M USDC for several weeks. SpotOnChain maintained that the continued endeavor for Circle’s USDC mint was to meet the market-wide demand of the stablecoin. Tether wants to influence how stablecoins are regulated in the U.S. Eleanor Terrett, FoxBusiness journalist, also reported that Tether was working with U.S. lawmakers to influence how fiat-backed currencies are regulated in the U.S. Terrett disclosed that Tether had never received a full audit, but opted to provide quarterly assessments of its financial books from global accounting firm BDO. The journalist revealed that Tether had around 60% of the $230 billion stablecoin market. She also added that the company had become one of the largest holders of U.S. debt in the world, with over $114 billion of short-term Treasury bills in its reserves. Terret highlighted that Congress was working to create legislation that will set a regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S. Ardoino told Terrett that the company was actively engaging with top lawmakers on how to best shape the law. The journalist said that Congressman Bryan Steil had confirmed to Fox Business that Tether had been engaging in the discussion draft of the STABLE Act, which he and Congressman French Hill had introduced last week. According to Terrett, Tether would need to submit to a full monthly audit by a U.S. accounting firm for compliance with proposed regulations. The firm would also be required to maintain one-to-one reserves with assets that are pre-approved by regulators.

Following the release of unexpectedly positive UK labor market data, the British currency staged a notable recovery against major peers. This development has injected a fresh dose of optimism into the market, prompting traders and investors to reassess their positions on GBP, particularly in the popular GBP/USD pair. Let’s delve into the details of this economic upturn and explore what it signifies for the Pound Sterling and the broader financial landscape. UK Labor Market Data: A Beacon of Positivity The Office for National Statistics (ONS) delivered a pleasant surprise with its latest report on the UK labor market data. For the three months leading up to December, the UK economy showcased unexpected strength by adding a substantial 107,000 workers. This figure dwarfs the mere 35,000 jobs added in the preceding September-November period, signaling a significant acceleration in employment growth. Furthermore, the ILO Unemployment Rate remained steady at 4.4%, defying expectations of a rise to 4.5%. This resilience in the face of economic headwinds has been a key driver in the Pound Sterling’s recent resurgence. Here’s a quick look at the key labor market indicators: Indicator Current Reading (Dec) Previous Reading (Nov) Expectation Employment Change +107K +35K N/A Unemployment Rate 4.4% 4.4% 4.5% Average Earnings excl. Bonus 5.9% 5.6% 5.9% Average Earnings incl. Bonus 6.0% 5.6% 5.9% This positive UK labor market data comes at a crucial time, especially considering concerns raised by business owners regarding increased employer contributions to National Insurance. Chancellor Rachel Reeves’s Autumn Budget announcement of a 1.2% increase to 15%, effective from April, had cast a shadow over business sentiment. However, the robust employment figures suggest a degree of underlying economic strength that might mitigate these concerns. Contradictory Signals? BoE’s Dovish Tone vs. Strong Jobs Numbers Interestingly, the upbeat labor data appears to contradict recent comments from Bank of England (BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey. Just a day prior to the data release, Bailey expressed concerns about “some softness” in the labor market during an interview. He also maintained a cautious economic outlook, suggesting that even surprisingly positive Q4 GDP data hadn’t altered the “bigger picture” of sluggish growth. The BoE’s February monetary policy statement had already halved growth forecasts for the year to a mere 0.75%. Adding to the complexity, wage growth figures also exceeded expectations. Average Earnings Excluding bonuses rose to 5.9%, matching forecasts but up from 5.6% previously. Including bonuses, the figure jumped to 6.0%, surpassing both estimates and the prior reading of 5.6%. Sustained high wage growth could fuel inflation worries, potentially limiting the BoE’s flexibility to cut interest rates and potentially forcing them to maintain the current rate of 4.5% for longer than anticipated. GBP/USD Reaction and Market Movers The immediate market reaction to the UK labor market data was a sharp recovery in the Pound Sterling. The GBP/USD pair, which had earlier dipped to near 1.2590 as the US Dollar gained strength, bounced back above 1.2600. While still slightly down on the day, the Pound managed to recoup a significant portion of its intraday losses. Here’s a snapshot of the British Pound’s performance against major currencies today: Currency vs GBP % Change USD GBP/USD -0.14% EUR GBP/EUR 0.11% JPY GBP/JPY 0.23% CAD GBP/CAD -0.07% AUD GBP/AUD -0.07% NZD GBP/NZD 0.39% CHF GBP/CHF -0.15% The US Dollar Index (DXY) also saw a rebound, climbing back to near 107.00 after hitting a two-month low. This Dollar strength is partly attributed to expectations of persistent inflationary pressures stemming from potential economic policies under President Trump’s administration, including proposed tariffs. Furthermore, hawkish comments from Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, suggesting that current interest rates are “in a good place,” have bolstered the Dollar as markets anticipate rates staying higher for longer. Eyes on FOMC Minutes and UK CPI Looking ahead, market participants are keenly awaiting two key events on Wednesday: the UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for January and the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC minutes) from their January meeting. The UK CPI data will be crucial in determining whether inflationary pressures are easing or persisting. A higher-than-expected CPI reading could further strengthen the Pound, as it would reinforce the view that the BoE may need to maintain or even raise interest rates to combat inflation. Conversely, a lower CPI could dampen enthusiasm and potentially lead to a GBP pullback. Simultaneously, the FOMC minutes will provide valuable insights into the Federal Reserve’s thinking regarding monetary policy. Investors will scrutinize the minutes for any clues about the Fed’s future path for interest rates. Any hints of a more hawkish stance, suggesting rates could remain elevated for an extended period, would likely further support the US Dollar, potentially putting downward pressure on GBP/USD. Technical Outlook for GBP/USD From a technical perspective, the GBP/USD pair is currently attempting to establish a firm footing above the 1.2600 level. The near-term outlook appears to be turning bullish as the pair holds above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) around 1.2500. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also comfortably above 60.00, suggesting positive momentum. A sustained RSI above 60.00 could signal further upside potential. Key technical levels to watch: Support: 1.2500 (50-day EMA), 1.2250 (February 3 low) Resistance: 1.2810 (December 6 high) Conclusion: Sterling’s Strength Faces Upcoming Hurdles The Pound Sterling’s recent recovery, fueled by surprisingly robust UK labor market data, offers a glimmer of hope for bulls. However, the currency’s upward trajectory is not without its challenges. Contradictory signals from the BoE, coupled with looming inflation data and the highly anticipated FOMC minutes, create a complex and potentially volatile environment for GBP/USD. Traders should remain vigilant and closely monitor these upcoming events to gauge the Pound’s true strength and future direction in the Forex arena. The interplay between domestic economic data, central bank rhetoric, and global market sentiment will be crucial in determining whether this Pound Sterling surge can be sustained or if it’s merely a temporary reprieve.

With links to CZ, both these tokens have plummeted 60-80% from their peak over the past week, creating major market panic. Binance Founder CZ to Donate to TST and BROCCOLI Victims Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has recently landed in the middle of the meme coin frenzy by building hype around his dog name BROCCOLI , which led to the creation of several meme coins under this name thereby triggering a major pump and dump. Although the meme coin CZ’s Dog BROCCOLI price shot up by 160% initially on launch, the token has plummeted more than 75% from the peak causing a large number of investors to lose money in FOMO. CZ has now decided to do some course reversal by helping the victims of these meme coins. On Tuesday, the Binance founder donated a total of 150 BNB worth around $100,000 to a university student who had already contributed $50,000 of his own funds to assist victims of the Libra project. Furthermore, CZ noted that this student appeared to have made substantial gains from BNB investments. Interestingly, the address where Zhao sent his donation has since received more BNB than his initial contribution, along with additional tokens. He said that he wouldn’t keep any of these funds and would rather donate to the victims of TST token and BROCCOLI meme coin. In his message on X platform , the Binance founder wrote: “I won’t be keeping a satoshi of it. Will donate it away, most likely to people who had a loss on TST or some of the Broccolis. This is NOT an endorsement for any of the tokens. Do NOT overinterpret this.” “When you try to make quick money, you often lose. When you give money away, you get more back,” he added. Caught in the Meme Coin Frenzy The Binance founder finds himself caught in the middle of a meme coin frenzy after he shared an educational video of BNB Chain last week, which featured a Test (TST) token as an example. This led to the creation of TST meme coin that witnessed huge trading activity. However, Zhao has completely distanced himself from this development. The TST price is down more than 52% over the past week, with daily trading volumes shooting 48% to more than $205 million. Zhao also shared his recent views on the pump and dump in LIBRA tokens , endorsed by Argentinian President Javier Milei. In his post, CZ emphasized the importance of caution for industry figures with influential online profiles when endorsing tokens. He pointed out that the tokenomics of any asset plays a critical role in its overall value and sustainability.

The Senate confirmed Lutnick with a 51-45 vote conducted on Tuesday, Feb. 18, according to The New York Times . The former CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick, has been a strong proponent of Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether ( USDT ). Bitcoin “should be free to trade everywhere in the world,” Lutnick has previously stated, likening it to gold. He defended Tether’s USDT reserves at the Bitcoin Conference 2024, saying that they were fully backed by gold, Bitcoin, and U.S. Treasuries. He also pushed back against concerns about stablecoins’ role in illegal funding during his Senate confirmation hearing. Given that the SEC is reviewing applications for staking in Ethereum ETFs, his appointment may influence a change in the Commerce Department’s position on digital assets. You might also like: Ripple updates: SEC acknowledges Grayscale’s XRP ETF filing Beyond cryptocurrency, Lutnick will be crucial to Trump’s assertive trade ambitions. He refuted arguments that tariffs cause inflation, calling them “nonsense,” and defended the use of tariffs as a weapon to compel trading partners into reducing trade barriers. His position supports Trump’s call for higher tariffs fees to safeguard American businesses. Trump’s push for higher tariffs has come under fire from conservative economists who claim that tariffs increase prices for American consumers. Lutnick left Cantor Fitzgerald to adhere to federal ethics regulations. Cantor has strengthened his connections with the cryptocurrency sector by offering custody services to Tether. He will lead a department of more than 50,000 workers in his role as Commerce Secretary, a position in which he will manage trade policies, technological exports, and economic regulations. Crypto enthusiasts and Trump’s larger economic objectives could both benefit from his confirmation. But his pro-tariff position might worsen tensions with U.S. trading partners, which would likely lead to new trade negotiations.

All eyes are on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) as it gears up to announce its first monetary policy decision of 2025 on Tuesday. The buzz in the market? A widely anticipated RBA interest rate cut – the first in over four years. But what does this mean for your crypto portfolio and the broader markets? Let’s dive deep into what’s expected and the potential ripple effects. Will the RBA Deliver the First Interest Rate Cut? For months, the RBA has held the Official Cash Rate (OCR) steady at 4.35%, battling stubbornly high inflation. But the tide may be turning. Australian core inflation has shown signs of easing, albeit remaining above the RBA’s target. This delicate balance between inflation and economic pressure is now forcing the RBA’s hand. Market participants are overwhelmingly predicting a 25 basis points (bps) cut to the RBA interest rate . This move is seen as a response to the growing concerns about household and business strain amidst sluggish economic growth. Here’s a quick rundown of the key factors influencing this anticipated decision: Easing Inflation: The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data revealed a slower-than-expected inflation rise in the last quarter of 2024. The RBA’s preferred Trimmed Mean CPI also showed a deceleration, fueling expectations for a rate cut. Economic Growth Concerns: Sustained high interest rates are starting to bite, impacting economic activity. Policymakers are under pressure to stimulate growth. Solid Employment Growth (A Balancing Act): While inflation is showing signs of cooling, robust employment growth presents a counterargument against aggressive rate cuts. Strong job numbers can indicate a still-resilient economy, potentially reigniting inflationary pressures. Australian Dollar on Edge Ahead of Decision The Australian Dollar (AUD) is currently in a state of consolidation against the US Dollar, holding onto recent gains. Traders are keenly watching for signals from the RBA’s announcement. The currency’s reaction will heavily depend on the magnitude of the rate cut and, crucially, the RBA’s forward guidance. Consider these potential scenarios and their impact on the AUD/USD: Scenario RBA Action Potential AUD/USD Impact Expected Cut 25 bps interest rate cut Moderate AUD selling pressure, depends on forward guidance. Dovish Surprise 50 bps interest rate cut or hints at aggressive future cuts Significant bearish pressure on AUD. Hawkish Cut 25 bps cut but signals slow easing cycle Potential AUD strength, perceived as less dovish than expected. Expert Insight: Valeria Bednarik on AUD/USD Outlook Valeria Bednarik, Chief Analyst at Bitcoin World, offers her technical perspective on the Australian Dollar : “The AUD/USD pair peaked at 0.6373 ahead of the announcement, its highest since mid-December. Technically, the pair remains bullish, supported by broad US Dollar weakness. The Greenback is under pressure as markets react to concerns about US fiscal policy and the Federal Reserve’s stance.” Bednarik further adds, “Uncertainty surrounding potential US tariffs and their impact on the Australian economy is also likely on the RBA’s radar. Technically, AUD/USD has room to advance towards 0.6470, but faces immediate resistance at its recent high of 0.6373 and then 0.6430. A dovish RBA outcome could trigger a fall below 0.6300, potentially extending down to 0.6230.” Decoding the Monetary Policy Decision and Press Conference The RBA’s monetary policy decision goes beyond just the interest rate cut figure. Governor Michele Bullock’s press conference following the announcement will be crucial. Market participants will be dissecting her words for clues about the future path of interest rates. Is this the start of a series of cuts, or a cautious one-off adjustment? Key questions to watch for during the press conference: Future Guidance: Will the RBA signal further rate cuts are likely, or emphasize a data-dependent approach? Inflation Outlook: How concerned is the RBA about persistent inflation, and what are their expectations for it returning to the target band? Economic Growth Assessment: What is the RBA’s assessment of the current economic slowdown and the need for further stimulus? Frequently Asked Questions: Understanding the Australian Dollar What key factors drive the Australian Dollar ? The Australian Dollar’s value is influenced by a mix of factors, including: RBA Interest Rates: Higher rates generally attract foreign investment, boosting the AUD. Commodity Prices (Iron Ore): As a resource-rich nation, Australia’s export prices, particularly iron ore, significantly impact the AUD. Chinese Economy: China’s economic health, being Australia’s largest trading partner, directly affects demand for Australian exports and the AUD. Domestic Economic Health: Inflation, employment, and economic growth within Australia are crucial determinants. Market Sentiment: Global risk appetite influences the AUD, often seen as a risk-on currency. How do RBA decisions impact the Australian Dollar ? The RBA’s primary tool is setting the interest rate . By adjusting rates, they aim to manage inflation and influence economic activity. Higher rates tend to strengthen the AUD, while lower rates can weaken it. Quantitative easing (QE) and tightening also play a role, with QE typically weakening the AUD and tightening strengthening it. How does the Chinese economy impact the Australian Dollar ? China’s robust economic growth translates to increased demand for Australian resources, boosting the Australian Dollar . Conversely, a slowdown in China can dampen demand and weigh on the AUD. Chinese economic data releases often trigger reactions in the AUD market. How does the price of Iron Ore impact the Australian Dollar ? Iron ore is Australia’s top export. Rising iron ore prices increase demand for the Australian Dollar as buyers need AUD to purchase the commodity. This positive correlation means iron ore price fluctuations are a key driver for the AUD. How does the Trade Balance impact the Australian Dollar ? A positive Trade Balance (exports exceeding imports) signifies strong demand for Australian goods and services. This naturally increases demand for the Australian Dollar , pushing its value higher. A negative Trade Balance can have the opposite effect. Economic Indicator: RBA Press Conference The RBA Governor’s press conference is a vital event for understanding the central bank’s thinking and future policy direction. A hawkish tone, suggesting further rate hikes or a slower pace of easing, can strengthen the Australian Dollar . Conversely, a dovish message, indicating more aggressive rate cuts or concerns about economic weakness, can weaken the AUD. Keep an eye on the next press conference scheduled for Tue Feb 18, 2025, at 04:30 GMT.

The recent scoop reveals his sister, Karina Milei, was allegedly paid to influence him in promoting the Libra (LIBRA) token, raising more doubts and concerns for crypto investors. This revelation has sparked political turmoil, with opposition leaders calling for his impeachment over potential misconduct. Karina Milei, a key figure in Argentina’s government and General Secretary of the Presidency, has remained silent as controversy grabs eyeballs around the LIBRA token scandal. While it’s unclear if any money changed hands, leaked messages suggest Hayden Davis, the man behind the token, claimed he could pay Milei’s inner circle for influence. This adds new fuel to an anti-corruption probe into President Javier Milei, who previously promoted LIBRA as a funding tool for small businesses. Leaked Messages Raise Questions According to La Nacion, Hayden Davis, CEO of Kelsier Ventures and linked to the LIBRA token, reportedly sent messages claiming he had control over Milei through his sister. In the messages, Davis allegedly stated, “I send $$ to his sister, and he does whatever I say.” He also suggested he could arrange a personal meeting with Milei to promote the token. However, Davis has denied these claims, saying he doesn’t recall sending the messages and has no record of them on his phone. He also insisted that neither Javier nor Karina Milei received any money from him. LIBRA Token’s Rise and Fall LIBRA had a massive launch, reaching a $4.5 billion market cap at its peak. However, the token quickly crashed by 95% , causing huge losses for investors. Reports suggest Davis and Kelsier Ventures made nearly $100 million from the launch. Davis, however, maintains that he never owned or sold the tokens. Milei’s Response In an interview with Todo Noticias, Milei denied promoting the token and instead said he merely “spread the word” about it. He insisted he had “nothing to hide” and acted “in good faith” but admitted he needs to be more cautious in the future. Milei emphasized that the government had no involvement in the LIBRA situation, stating, “The state plays no role here.” However, the controversy has already damaged his reputation, with critics accusing him of misleading the public. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Argentina’s Javier Milei Faces Fraud Charges After LIBRA Crypto Rug Pull Scandal , Political Fallout With opposition leaders pushing for impeachment, this scandal could become a major political challenge for Milei.

In the meanwhile Milei is already facing a lawsuit filed after many legal complaints of crypto losses due to his actions. As the dust settles, Milei’s political future remains uncertain. Whether this controversy fades or escalates depends on how the public and lawmakers react to the allegations in the coming weeks. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In Norway, four men have been charged with orchestrating an $80 million investment fraud, allegedly laundering funds through a law firm’s accounts. Meanwhile, Abstract is investigating reports of a wallet drain affecting some users, with early findings pointing to a third-party application rather than a flaw in its core infrastructure. Norwegian Authorities Charge Four Men in Alleged $80 Million Crypto Investment Scam In a significant crackdown on financial fraud, Norwegian authorities have charged four men for allegedly orchestrating a large-scale cryptocurrency investment scam that defrauded thousands of investors worldwide. The scheme, which reportedly amassed over 900 million Norwegian kroner ($80 million), allegedly funneled illicit funds through a law firm’s accounts to obscure its origins. Norway’s National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime, known as Økokrim, announced the charges on Feb. 16, detailing the intricate web of deception that lured in unsuspecting investors. According to Økokrim state prosecutor Joakim Ziesler Berge, the case represents one of the largest investment frauds to have affected international investors in recent years. “We believe this is a large and extensive fraud,” Berge said. “We are talking about a large number of victims in many countries who have lost their money and significant sums that have ended up with the defendants.” Økokrim alleges that victims were misled into believing they were investing in a highly profitable business that claimed to hold significant assets in gas, mining operations, and real estate. Investors were enticed by promises of lucrative returns, backed by what appeared to be a well-structured financial venture. However, the reality was starkly different. The scheme made no significant investments beyond the collected deposits and had no actual earnings. Instead, funds were cycled through a classic Ponzi-like structure where existing investors were encouraged to recruit new participants, further expanding the web of deception. To further conceal the illicit proceeds, Norwegian authorities claim that over 700 million Norwegian kroner ($62 million) was laundered through a Norwegian law firm’s accounts, as well as multiple corporate entities based in Asia. This strategic layering of funds, Økokrim noted, significantly complicated efforts to track and recover the money. “The use of client accounts and company structures in Norway and internationally has complicated the work of uncovering what happened to the money,” said Økokrim in a statement. Money laundering through law firms and shell companies is a well-documented tactic used by financial criminals to obscure the origins of illicit funds. By channeling stolen funds through legitimate business entities, fraudsters can effectively disguise the money trail, making it harder for authorities to trace and seize assets. The four accused men, aged between their 50s and 70s, are all Norwegian nationals and are believed to have run the fraudulent operation from March 2015 to November 2018. According to Norwegian media outlet NRK, three of the accused are facing charges related to the fraudulent collection of investment funds, while the fourth individual has been charged with money laundering. One of the defendants, represented by Christian Flemmen Johansen of Flemmen & Co Law Firm, has denied all allegations, asserting his client had no involvement in fraudulent activities. Similarly, another defendant’s lawyer, Ole Petter Drevland, stated that his client rejects any criminal responsibility in the case. Information regarding the legal representation of the other two defendants has yet to be disclosed. Despite the denials, Norwegian authorities remain steadfast in their pursuit of justice, emphasizing the scale of financial losses and the international scope of the fraudulent operation. A Widespread Issue in the Crypto Space The Norwegian case echoes similar high-profile cryptocurrency fraud cases worldwide. One of the most infamous cases is the BitConnect Ponzi scheme, where Indian authorities recently seized $190 million in crypto assets linked to fraudulent activities. Cryptocurrency-based Ponzi and pyramid schemes remain a persistent challenge for regulators. These scams often rely on exaggerated profit promises, targeting both retail and institutional investors with sophisticated marketing tactics. The digital nature of crypto transactions further complicates law enforcement efforts, as fraudsters exploit cross-border financial networks to conceal illicit gains. The case is set to go to trial in Oslo District Court in September and is expected to span over 60 days, reflecting the complexity and volume of evidence involved. If convicted, the defendants could face severe financial penalties and lengthy prison sentences under Norwegian fraud and money laundering laws. As the investigation unfolds, authorities are likely to trace additional assets, and investors worldwide will be watching closely in hopes of recovering lost funds. With crypto-related financial crimes on the rise, the case shows the importance of investor due diligence and regulatory oversight in an increasingly digitized financial landscape. While cryptocurrencies offer innovative financial solutions, they also provide fertile ground for fraudulent schemes when left unchecked. The Norwegian case serves as a cautionary tale for investors to thoroughly vet investment opportunities, particularly those promising unrealistically high returns. As financial regulators and law enforcement agencies continue strengthening their oversight of the crypto industry, cases like this highlight the urgent need for greater transparency and accountability in digital asset markets. The Oslo trial will likely set a precedent for how similar crypto fraud cases are handled in Norway and beyond, as authorities work to dismantle fraudulent operations and protect investors from financial exploitation in the evolving world of digital finance. Ethereum Layer-2 Platform Abstract Investigates Wallet Drain Issue Following Major Milestone In other news, Ethereum Layer-2 (L2) scaling solution Abstract is currently investigating reports of a wallet drain incident, after some users reported unauthorized fund withdrawals from their accounts. The issue, which appears to be linked to a single application rather than a platform-wide vulnerability, surfaced just a day after the project celebrated a significant milestone—the deployment of over 1 million Abstract Global Wallets (AGW). On Feb. 18, a developer from the Abstract Chain team, 0xBeans, alerted the community via X that some Abstract users had been affected by a wallet compromise. However, they were quick to clarify that the issue was not a fundamental flaw with AGW wallets but rather an incident affecting a specific application within the ecosystem. “Seems to be Cardex, please do not interact for the time being,” 0xBeans wrote, pointing at the Cardex game—an Abstract-based application—as a possible source of the vulnerability. The announcement came just a day after another developer, 0xCygaar, proudly announced that Abstract had deployed over 1 million AGW wallets, making it one of the leading smart wallet providers in the Ethereum L2 ecosystem. “We’ve done more than almost anyone else in the space to bring on the next generation of smart wallets,” 0xCygaar posted on Feb. 17, adding, “We’re just getting started.” Following concerns from the community, 0xCygaar reiterated that the security breach was not related to Abstract’s wallet contracts or infrastructure but rather to session key mismanagement in Cardex. “This is not an issue with AGW’s contracts. There is no exploit with wallet functionality,” 0xCygaar stated. “This specific issue is related to negligence on the app regarding session key management.” He further reassured the community that Abstract’s contracts had undergone multiple security audits, including a specific review of the session key module—an integral component of AGW wallets. “We had our session key module looked at specifically. These reports will be available shortly,” he added. Despite Abstract’s assurances, the crypto community remains on edge, with some users questioning whether other applications within the ecosystem could pose similar risks. One of the main concerns stems from Abstract’s past promotion of Cardex. Some users have accused the project of endorsing the application, potentially misleading investors and users into trusting it. “You promoted Cardex on the website and official X account following them! It’s your fault!” one frustrated user wrote, demanding accountability from the Abstract team. However, as of now, Cardex does not appear anywhere on Abstract’s official website or blog, raising further questions about the nature of its association with the project. Additionally, some users have reported losing funds despite never interacting with Cardex, leading to speculation that the breach may not be as contained as initially thought. A Setback Following Abstract’s Mainnet Launch The wallet drain incident comes less than a month after Abstract launched its mainnet on Jan. 27. The project, created by Igloo—the parent company behind the well-known NFT brand Pudgy Penguins—has been one of the most ambitious Layer-2 initiatives in the Ethereum space. Back in July 2024, Igloo successfully raised $11 million in funding to build Abstract, with the goal of making smart wallets more accessible and enhancing security in decentralized applications (dApps). This latest setback is a stark reminder of the security challenges that still plague the cryptocurrency ecosystem, particularly when it comes to third-party applications leveraging blockchain infrastructure. While Abstract developers have assured users that the core AGW wallet infrastructure remains secure, the team is still investigating the full scope of the breach and its potential impact on the broader Abstract ecosystem. For now, users are being urged to revoke session keys associated with Cardex and exercise caution when interacting with third-party applications built on Abstract. As the investigation unfolds, the crypto community will be watching closely to see whether Abstract can contain the issue and rebuild trust after this security scare. Given the platform’s ambitious plans and its rapid growth, ensuring robust security measures will be crucial for maintaining its position in the competitive Ethereum Layer-2 market. This incident is yet another reminder that even well-audited blockchain systems can be vulnerable to third-party application exploits, emphasizing the need for constant vigilance and improved security standards in the DeFi and Web3 space.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ZRX|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-19 06:00:00

He noted that many investors are selling their holdings out of panic rather than focusing on long-term potential. Farina said such short-term reactions could lead to significant missed opportunities, especially if XRP eventually reaches a three-digit valuation. He believes that major financial institutions, including Wall Street firms, Grayscale, and BlackRock, may later seek to acquire XRP at much higher prices, possibly from those who held on through volatility. Retail is panicking, selling $XRP for a 5% dip. But when the market flips and $XRP becomes the new standard, they'll be begging to buy it back from you at 3 digits. Wall Street, Grayscale, BlackRock, they’ll be on their knees, crying for what you HODL! DON'T GIVE IT FOR FREE! — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) February 18, 2025 Other cryptocurrency enthusiasts share similar views. Sergei Ermolov commented , “If people panic when XRP dropped by 5%, I have nothing to say to them. In a year, they will remember when they sold the treasure because of the 5% drawdown.” Another user, Silveraddict, emphasized the importance of a long-term strategy, stating , “You can’t be bothered with the day-to-day action. The powers that be know what they are doing, playing on your emotions. Buy it, put it in cold storage, and wait patiently. It will hit, and when it does, you will forget about all the waiting.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Current Market Position As of February 18, 2025, data from CoinMarketCap shows that XRP is trading at $2.54, marking a 3.04% decrease from the previous close. The cryptocurrency experienced an intraday high of $2.68 and a low of $2.54. These fluctuations highlight the inherent volatility in the digital asset market, where short-term price movements often lead to reactive trading behavior. XRP Long-Term Adoption and Future Valuation Farina has expressed strong confidence in XRP’s long-term potential. He predicted that the asset could be widely adopted by banks, governments, and retail users globally within five years. He also envisions a future where commodities such as gold are tokenized on the XRP Ledger, reinforcing its utility in the financial sector. Additionally, Farina believes that Ripple , the company utilizing XRP, could evolve into a multi-trillion-dollar entity. He said in such a scenario, purchasing XRP at $500 could be a favorable investment. This perspective aligns with his advocacy for a patient and disciplined investment strategy.

Investors who hesitated during XRP’s climb are now racing toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending platform whose presale has already raised $774,320.3 in its opening phase. With 1,320 holders onboard and 70% of phase one tokens claimed, Mutuum Finance is emerging as the crypto market’s latest magnet for those chasing explosive returns. Mutuum Finance Attracts Missed Opportunity Investors As XRP’s price leaped from $0.60 to $2.86 following Forbes’ criticism, latecomers watched gains slip away. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now offers a similar opportunity, priced at just $0.01 during its initial presale phase. Early participants stand to secure a 600% profit at launch, with the token expected to hit $0.06 once listed. Beyond that, analysts highlight a post-launch target of $1 in 2025, a 100x leap from today’s entry point. This potential has triggered a rush, as phase one edges closer to selling out. Operating as a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol, Mutuum Finance enables users to earn passive income or access liquidity without selling assets. Lenders deposit tokens like USDT into pools, earning adjustable interest rates tied to demand. Borrowers, meanwhile, collateralize holdings such as ETH to secure loans, retaining ownership while unlocking funds. The platform supports both peer-to-contract (P2C) transactions via audited smart contracts and peer-to-peer (P2P) deals, offering flexibility and security. Adding to its appeal, Mutuum Finance plans to launch an overcollateralized stablecoin, backed fully by on-chain reserves. This feature aims to stabilize borrowing options and amplify utility, positioning MUTM as more than a speculative asset. Presale Momentum Builds Rapidly Mutuum Finance’s presale has gained speed since launching, with phase one tokens vanishing swiftly. Investors recognize the window for maximum returns is narrowing: each subsequent phase increases the token price before its $0.06 debut. Those buying now at $0.01 could see investments grow sixfold at launch. Comparatively, XRP’s 9x surge since 2023 pales next to MUTM’s short-term potential. Beyond financial mechanics, Mutuum Finance prioritizes community growth. The ongoing $100,000 giveaway targets 10 winners, requiring only social media engagement for entry. Such initiatives mirror tactics used by successful predecessors, fostering loyalty ahead of major milestones. Additionally, the beta platform’s imminent release ensures operational readiness at launch, an advantage many presale projects lack. Analysts Predict 100x Growth by 2025 Market experts point to Mutuum Finance’s structured ecosystem as the catalyst for long-term growth. The platform’s buy-and-distribute mechanism will channel fees into purchasing MUTM from open markets, redistributing tokens to stakers. This creates constant demand, steadily lifting prices. Combined with the stablecoin’s launch and expanding user base, MUTM’s path to $1 in 2025 appears grounded in tangible use, not hype. For investors sidelined during XRP’s rise, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a second chance with higher stakes. Phase one’s $0.01 price, the lowest available, offers a fleeting entry before escalations begin. With 600% gains at launch and a $1 forecast within two years, the project merges short-term profit with enduring utility. Mutuum Finance is positioning itself not as a speculative gamble, but a calculated investment in decentralized finance’s future. The presale’s rapid progress signals widening recognition: those delaying risk missing the next major surge. Secure MUTM tokens today, before phase one closes and prices climb irrevocably. Time is critical as Mutuum Finance’s opening presale phase nears completion. Investors seeking transformative returns in 2024 and beyond are swiftly claiming positions. With XRP’s skeptics still counting losses from hesitation, MUTM offers a clear lesson: early action unlocks unparalleled rewards.

He announced that he would discuss a “DOGE Dividend” with former President Donald Trump, providing a $5,000 tax refund to every taxpayer. However, in a surprising twist, the White House has denied that Musk is in charge of DOGE, raising questions about his influence over the program. Musk’s $5,000 Tax Refund Proposal The “DOGE Dividend” has taken the internet by storm, with many wondering if they could soon receive an extra $5,000 in their tax refunds However, the proposal stems from Azoria CEO James Fishback’s suggestion that DOGE has saved around $400 billion. He proposed using about 20% of these savings, roughly $50–$55 billion, to distribute among 79 million taxpayers, giving each a $5,000 rebate. This money would come from billions of dollars saved by reducing government waste. DOGE has reportedly cut costs through fraud detection, eliminating unneeded programs, and canceling overpriced contracts. Musk responded to this on X stating that he plans to discuss this proposal with former President Donald Trump. Will check with the President — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 18, 2025 Is Musk Leading DOGE? Despite Musk’s strong push for government savings, the White House recently clarified that he is not in charge of DOGE . Many believed he was the head of the program, but officials now state that he is only a consultant. This means he does not have the power to make final decisions about tax refunds or any other government actions. While this proposal is gaining attention, there is no official confirmation that the government will distribute these checks. The idea remains in discussion, and Musk has said he will take it up with Trump. What Happens Next? Since Trump took office as the 47th President, Musk has been involved in government cost-cutting efforts. He has repeatedly emphasized the need to remove wasteful spending and improve efficiency. However, with the White House distancing him from DOGE leadership, it remains unclear how much control he has. For now, Americans will have to wait and see whether the proposed $5,000 refund becomes a reality or just another political discussion.",News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|DOGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-19 06:01:12

According to its latest report, Bitcoin is down a modest 2% for the week as risk-averse traders drive down returns, volatility, and trading volumes. Vetle Lunde, K33’s Director of Research, noted that while a pro-crypto Trump Administration offers long-term positives for Bitcoin and the broader industry, current uncertainty is suppressing market activity. “Bitcoin metrics are softening across every corner of the market. Volumes, yields, option premiums and ETF flows have moved to areas not seen since before the election. Alongside these muted conditions, volatility has also slowed to its lowest levels in months,” Lunde said in a statement. Lunde also noted that 37% of the top 100 U.S. companies currently exhibit higher 30-day volatility than Bitcoin, a phenomenon last seen in October 2023. However, he cautioned that these periods of low volatility tend to be short-lived, urging investors to prepare for potential market upheavals. Related News: BREAKING: Following Today's Distributions, FTX Sets Date for Next Major Creditor Repayments “While the general risk aversion trend suggests that investors are prepared for downside volatility, moderate leverage levels suggest that liquidity chains currently carry less risk,” Lunde added. Lunde’s analysis of CME Bitcoin Futures points to a possible shift in the market. Lunde noted that futures premiums have historically fallen below 5%, a rare occurrence. Examining data from 2021 to 2025, K33 found that lower futures premiums generally coincide with weaker Bitcoin market performance and are likely influenced by a prolonged bear market in 2022. In futures, the basis is the difference between the futures price and the spot price. A premium occurs when futures prices exceed spot prices and generally indicates bullish sentiment, while a discount indicates bearish conditions. Lunde emphasized that Bitcoin performs best in a strong base regime and advised caution given the current market uncertainty. “Given the current uncertainty, we advise caution until a clear directional signal emerges,” Lunde concluded. *This is not investment advice.

This partnership aims to unlock the untapped potential of assets locked across various Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks, enhancing capital efficiency and introducing a new DeFi primitive. Currently, a significant amount of assets is locked in Uniswap V3 liquidity pools alone. While these assets facilitate liquidity provision for Automated Market Makers and lending protocols, their potential for generating additional yield remains underutilized. Through this collaboration, these assets can be utilized in restaking and shared security protocols, potentially generating additional yield while maintaining their current risk profile. Collateral Abstraction, a concept introduced by Symbiotic, enables these assets to participate in restaking and shared security protocols, potentially increasing yield while maintaining a comparable risk profile. With Diffuse’s zkServerless technology, the implementation of Collateral Abstraction becomes both practical and scalable, ensuring trustless operations across multiple blockchain networks. About Diffuse Diffuse is a zkServerless protocol dedicated to redefining trustless interoperability in Web3.

Just days after a mysterious deletion, Milei doubled down on his apparent endorsement of LIBRA, a relatively lesser-known cryptocurrency, by retweeting a tutorial on how to acquire it. This unexpected move, initially flagged by crypto-watcher Solid Intel (@solidintel_x) on X, has not only validated LIBRA in the eyes of many but also seemingly triggered a buying frenzy, exemplified by one savvy trader turning a multi-million dollar profit. Is this the dawn of mainstream meme coin adoption, fueled by presidential tweets? Let’s dive into the details of this fascinating crypto saga. Argentine President’s Explosive Crypto Endorsement Javier Milei, known for his unconventional and often libertarian-leaning political stances, has once again proven his penchant for disrupting the status quo. His actions in the digital currency space are no exception. The initial tweet, endorsing LIBRA, vanished as quickly as it appeared, leaving many to speculate whether it was a genuine endorsement or a social media mishap. However, the subsequent retweet of a tutorial on how to buy LIBRA leaves little room for doubt: President Milei is seemingly throwing his weight behind this particular digital asset. This public display of support from a head of state is particularly noteworthy in the often volatile and still somewhat nascent world of cryptocurrency. It raises several key questions: What is LIBRA? For those unfamiliar, LIBRA is a cryptocurrency that has recently gained traction, particularly within certain online communities. While details about its technology and use cases may vary depending on the specific token being referenced (as the name ‘LIBRA’ has been used for different projects), in this context, it appears to be a more recently emerged token, possibly categorized as a meme coin or community token. Why LIBRA? The reasons behind President Milei’s endorsement remain speculative. Is it a genuine belief in the project? A strategic move to appeal to a younger, digitally-native demographic? Or perhaps a broader statement about embracing decentralized finance and challenging traditional financial systems? What are the implications? A presidential endorsement, even through a retweet, can significantly impact public perception and market activity. It lends legitimacy to the project in the eyes of some and can encourage wider adoption, especially within Argentina and potentially beyond. The timeline of events, as reported by Solid Intel, paints a clear picture of Milei’s intriguing crypto maneuver: Initial Tweet (Deleted): President Milei posts a tweet that appears to endorse LIBRA. Tweet Deletion: The initial tweet is deleted, causing confusion and speculation. Retweet Tutorial: Milei retweets a tutorial explaining how to purchase LIBRA, seemingly reaffirming his support. This sequence of actions, from initial endorsement to tutorial sharing, strongly suggests a deliberate and calculated move to bring attention to LIBRA. Millionaire Trader’s Explosive $2.8M Profit: A Case Study in Meme Coin Mania The immediate aftermath of President Milei’s retweet saw a surge of activity around LIBRA, both in terms of social media buzz and trading volume. Lookonchain, another prominent crypto analytics platform, highlighted a particularly striking example of this market reaction. Trader goofyahh.sol, known for their astute crypto moves, made a significant investment in LIBRA following Milei’s endorsement. Here’s a breakdown of the trader’s activity, as reported by Lookonchain: Action Details Initial Investment 5 million USDC spent to purchase 10.4 million LIBRA Current Holding 10.4 million LIBRA Unrealized Profit (at time of report) $2.8 million Previous Profit on LIBRA $1.65 million This data illustrates the potentially explosive gains that can be achieved in the meme coin market, especially when coupled with high-profile endorsements. goofyahh.sol’s $2.8 million unrealized profit, on top of a previous $1.65 million gain, underscores the high-risk, high-reward nature of investing in such volatile assets. It’s a compelling example of how quickly fortunes can be made – and potentially lost – in the meme coin space. Decoding the Crypto Endorsement: What Does it Mean for LIBRA and Argentina? President Milei’s endorsement of LIBRA Crypto raises several important questions about the future of cryptocurrency in Argentina and the broader implications for meme coin legitimacy. Let’s consider some potential angles: Boost for Crypto Adoption in Argentina? Argentina has been grappling with economic instability and high inflation. Cryptocurrencies are often seen as an alternative to traditional financial systems in such environments. Milei’s pro-crypto stance, now explicitly extending to LIBRA Crypto , could signal a government openness to digital assets, potentially fostering greater adoption within the country. Legitimizing Meme Coins? Meme coins, often characterized by their internet-born origins and community-driven nature, have historically been viewed with skepticism by traditional investors. A presidential endorsement, however unconventional, could inject a degree of legitimacy into the meme coin market, attracting a wider range of participants. Volatility and Risk: It’s crucial to remember that meme coins like LIBRA Crypto are inherently volatile. Their price movements can be driven by social media trends, influencer endorsements, and market sentiment, often with little grounding in fundamental value. While the potential for explosive gains is evident, so too is the risk of significant losses. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased attention on LIBRA Crypto , fueled by presidential endorsement and trader profits, could attract regulatory scrutiny. Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies, and meme coins, with their rapid price fluctuations and often opaque origins, may face particular attention. Navigating the Meme Coin Frenzy: Benefits, Challenges, and Actionable Insights The LIBRA saga highlights both the allure and the perils of the meme coin market. For those considering venturing into this space, it’s essential to understand the landscape: Benefits of Investing in Meme Coins like LIBRA: High Potential Returns: As demonstrated by the trader goofyahh.sol’s experience, meme coins can offer the potential for rapid and substantial returns, far exceeding those typically found in traditional markets. Community-Driven Growth: Meme coins often thrive on strong online communities, which can drive organic growth and create a sense of shared ownership among investors. Accessibility: Meme coins are generally easily accessible through decentralized exchanges, making them available to a wide range of investors, regardless of their financial background. Challenges of Investing in Meme Coins like LIBRA: Extreme Volatility: Price swings in meme coins can be dramatic and unpredictable. Investors must be prepared for the possibility of significant losses. Lack of Fundamental Value: Unlike established cryptocurrencies with underlying technology or use cases, meme coin value is often driven purely by hype and speculation. Rug Pull Risks: The meme coin space is susceptible to scams and “rug pulls,” where project creators abandon the project and abscond with investor funds. Due diligence is paramount. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Meme Coin Market: Do Your Research: Before investing in any meme coin, including LIBRA Crypto , thoroughly research the project, its community, and its potential risks. Invest What You Can Afford to Lose: Given the inherent volatility, only invest funds that you can comfortably afford to lose without significant financial impact. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto portfolio and allocate only a small percentage to high-risk meme coins. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market trends, social media sentiment, and any news related to the meme coins you are interested in. Use Caution and Skepticism: Approach meme coin investments with a healthy dose of skepticism and be wary of hype-driven narratives. Conclusion: The Presidential Tweet Heard ‘Round the Crypto World Javier Milei’s crypto endorsement , particularly his retweet regarding LIBRA Crypto , has undeniably injected a fresh wave of excitement and speculation into the digital currency market. Whether it’s a strategic move, a genuine belief, or simply a reflection of his unconventional approach, the impact is undeniable. The tale of trader goofyahh.sol’s multi-million dollar profit serves as a stark reminder of the explosive potential – and inherent risks – within the meme coin ecosystem. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, presidential endorsements, meme coin mania, and the pursuit of astronomical gains will likely remain intertwined, creating a dynamic and often unpredictable market for investors to navigate. The Argentine President’s foray into LIBRA Crypto is a story that is still unfolding, and one that the crypto world will be watching closely.

In the past 24 hours, the total market capitalization of Solana-based meme coins has climbed to $11.5 billion, with top tokens like Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) and Bonk ($BONK) seeing gains of 10.3% and 2.9%, respectively. However, the rapid expansion of Solana’s ecosystem has also led to challenges – network congestion, transaction failures, and scalability issues are increasingly prevalent. With Solana continuing to dominate the meme coin market, the demand for a more efficient Layer-2 solution has never been higher. Solaxy is set to address these problems head-on with its upcoming Layer-2 scaling technology, positioning itself as a key player in the evolution of the Solana network. Currently, the $SOLX presale price sits at $0.001634, offering early participants a potential opportunity to gain exposure before future exchange listings. Solaxy’s Layer-2 Solution Aims to Transform Solana’s Ecosystem Solaxy is being developed as a next-generation Layer-2 scaling solution designed to bolster Solana’s performance while mitigating network congestion. While Solana is celebrated for its high-speed transactions and low fees, its increasing popularity has led to bottlenecks, causing failed transactions and delays. Solaxy’s innovative approach seeks to alleviate these pain points through upcoming off-chain transaction processing and optimized scalability solutions. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1887685176970649636 One of the upcoming innovations in Solaxy’s ecosystem is its off-chain processing model. Instead of executing every transaction on Solana’s Layer-1, Solaxy will process transactions externally before settling them on the mainnet. This method aims to reduce data loads, enabling seamless transaction flow even during high-traffic periods. Additionally, Solaxy’s transaction bundling technology will allow multiple transactions to be aggregated into a single batch, further enhancing efficiency and reducing costs. This feature aims to ensure that users experience minimal delays while keeping transaction fees at a fraction of what they would be on congested networks. Solaxy also plans on introducing its modular infrastructure to allow developers to build optimized dApps tailored to specific use cases. This could be particularly beneficial for high-transaction-volume sectors, such as meme coins, DeFi protocols, and NFT marketplaces. Beyond scalability, Solaxy is working toward cross-chain interoperability, aiming to establish a direct bridge between Solana and Ethereum. This would enable users to seamlessly move assets between the two networks, combining Solana’s speed with Ethereum’s liquidity. Due to the project’s focus on scalability, efficiency, and interoperability, the Solaxy presale continues to attract growing interest from early investors. Crypto Experts Identify Solaxy as a Long-Term Contender The success of Solaxy’s presale has caught the attention of prominent crypto analysts and influencers. Among them is YouTuber ClayBro, who boasts over 136,000 subscribers. ClayBro recently discussed the growing adoption of meme coin projects, emphasizing that despite market fluctuations, interest in promising presales remains strong. In his recent video, ClayBro states the Fear and Greed Index currently stands at 35, indicating a state of fear in the market. As this number rises, it reflects increasing investor confidence and growing market greed. Given that meme coin search volume is at an all-time high, ClayBro believes the index will soon shift, leading to higher trading volumes and driving greater demand for tokens. Solaxy Token Is Being Overlooked! Major Gains Ahead If Solaxy Can Do This One Simple Thing! When this happens, we could see the continuous adoption of new meme coins such as Solaxy. ClayBro also highlights that Solaxy is one of the fastest-growing meme coin presales in the market – second to only Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE), which has raised a massive $70 million so far. With the $WEPE presale running out in just the next few days, the attention may turn to Solaxy shortly after. While volatility is constant, especially among emerging crypto projects, Solaxy’s staking program offers a way for investors to generate passive returns. The current staking APY (annual percentage yield) sits at 200%, making it an attractive incentive for long-term holders. Additionally, over 5.7 billion $SOLX tokens have already been staked, reinforcing the community’s belief in the project’s future. How to Participate in the Solaxy Presale With more than $21 million already raised, Solaxy’s presale is gaining momentum as investors seek exposure to promising Layer-2 solutions. As the presale progresses, the price of $SOLX is expected to increase, providing early adopters with a potential opportunity to secure tokens at current rates. Interested participants can purchase $SOLX through the official Solaxy presale website. The platform supports a variety of payment methods, including Ethereum ($ETH), Tether ($USDT), and Binance Coin ($BNB). Additionally, for added convenience, purchases can be made via Credit Card. Furthermore, $SOLX is also available for purchase through the Best Wallet app , available on both Google Play and the Apple App Store . As Solana’s ecosystem continues to expand, the need for an effective Layer-2 scaling solution has never been more apparent. With its advanced transaction optimization techniques and strong community support, Solaxy is emerging as a key player in the next phase of blockchain evolution.

However, the third largest cryptocurrency is up by more than five percent on the weekly chart. However, the majority of the top 10 coins have drifted into the red zone, with Bitcoin trading below $96,000. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, XRP is following Bitcoin’s price movements, as is typical for many altcoins. With Bitcoin facing a pullback, XRP is also showing signs of weakness and may fail to sustain its recent breakout above the resistance level of $2.58 to $2.73. If XRP closes a daily candle below $2.58, this would be a bearish signal, hinting that the area could flip to resistance once again. However, a higher low above the previous low could still signal a potential positive outlook for XRP. Key Support Levels to Watch The next significant support levels for XRP are between $2.25 and $2.30. If XRP manages to hold above this, it could still maintain a bullish structure. A further pullback could test the $2 support level. Additionally, smaller support zones, like around $2.46 to $2.47, may also provide some relief if previous resistance levels flip to support. Bearish Divergence and Short-Term Outlook Despite the ongoing bearish divergence, which is still active, the price action may be approaching a local low. This could trigger a relief rally in the coming days, especially as the price nears oversold territories on the 2-hour chart. However, XRP may still dip slightly lower before finding support. In the short term, more choppy sideways price action is expected, with the larger bearish divergence potentially continuing until invalidated.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|BTC|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-19 06:16:05

This shows strong investor confidence but also sets the stage for what could be the most significant wallet token launch in the decentralized finance space. With an ambitious plan to secure 40% of the crypto wallet market by 2026, Best Wallet could become a dominant player in the industry, which could make investing in $BEST tokens during the presale worthwhile. $BEST Token Utility The $BEST token is the foundation of the Best Wallet ecosystem. Holding $BEST provides many benefits that enhance the Best Wallet user experience and maximize investment potential. Users holding $BEST enjoy reduced transaction costs across the Best Wallet ecosystem. Best Wallet’s staking aggregator also offers higher APY returns for those holding $BEST tokens. Beyond financial benefits, token holders can participate in governance decisions, influencing the future direction of the ecosystem. While the presale lasts, investors can stake their $BEST tokens to grow their holdings. Currently, the dynamic APY is 161%. However, dynamic yields drop when more tokens are staked, as they share the same emission pool. Crypto Gains, a popular crypto YouTube channel, has shared that this is one of the best token launches this year. He believes investing in $BEST now is like investing in MetaMask if it had a token launch. In other words, this launch could be massive. Best Wallet: Token Presale! It’s Like Investing In Metamask If That Had A Coin! EASY 10X? What makes the $BEST token unique is the exclusive Stage 0 access to new projects before they are available to the general public. For example, Best Wallet users had the opportunity to buy Catslap, a meme coin with gamified slapping mechanics, which launched at a $1 million market cap and peaked at $40 million a few days later. Investors who took the opportunity saw massive returns. Even the $BEST token presale started on the Best Wallet app for the first two weeks before becoming available to everyone else via its presale site. Investors who buy these vetted presales can do so at the earliest stages and claim the tokens post-launch within their wallets regardless of the chain, as Best Wallet is a multi-chain wallet. The $WEPE Claim is Now Live! You can now claim your $WEPE tokens directly in Best Wallet or through the official @WepeToken claim website. https://t.co/Yxin9GiUaN Read the full thread below for all the details! pic.twitter.com/MRWgvBu59E — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) February 17, 2025 A Game-Changer in Crypto Wallets Best Wallet is a multi-chain, non-custodial wallet that allows users to manage multiple cryptocurrencies within a single platform.

Security and user experience remain top priorities for Best Wallet. By integrating Fireblocks MPC-CMP technology, it becomes the first wallet in the industry to utilize this cutting-edge security feature, which also offers lightning-fast transaction signing. The Best Wallet team plans to launch the Best Card in the future, a crypto debit card that allows users to spend their crypto holdings on real-world transactions. Cashback rewards are planned for every purchase, but most importantly, $BEST token holders will see reduced transaction fees, which is another reason to hold $BEST tokens. Airdrop Success and Social Growth To strengthen its user base, the Best Wallet platform has launched an airdrop campaign that rewards wallet users with $BEST tokens. This is designed to allow even those unable to invest in the presale to still earn and benefit from the ecosystem. Participants in the airdrop campaign can complete daily and weekly quests that encourage engagement with wallet features, such as token swaps, presale purchases, and portfolio management. Engaging with and sharing the content on social media also earns points. Currently, the Best Wallet X account has over 50k followers and has grown massively since this Web3 wallet launched.

On Tuesday, Trump announced plans to impose auto tariffs of around 25%, along with similar duties on semiconductors and pharmaceutical imports. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 0.34% to below 39,200 on Wednesday, ending a two-day rally as investors reacted to disappointing economic data. The Japanese yen held its recent decline to around 152 per dollar on Thursday. Core machinery orders in Japan, a crucial gauge of capital spending, unexpectedly fell in December. Additionally, Japan reported a larger-than-anticipated trade deficit for January, with imports outpacing exports . Japan's manufacturers' sentiment improved for the second consecutive month, with the Reuters Tankan index rising to +3 in February 2025, up from +2 in January. In corporate news, Honda indicated its willingness to resume merger talks with Nissan, contingent on the resignation of Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.78% to above 3,340 and the Shenzhen Component climbing 1% to 10,720, recovering from the previous session's losses. The offshore yuan depreciated past 7.28 per dollar, marking its third consecutive session of losses, following the announcement of new tariff plans from US President Donald Trump. Further weighing on sentiment, Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, remarked that the US should be prepared to confront any potential military challenges from China, while remaining open to diplomatic talks with its rival. Separately, China criticized Trump’s tariffs at a WTO meeting Tuesday, citing inflation risk, market distortions, and a possible global recession, and urging Washington to withdraw its moves and engage in multilateral dialogues. On the economic front, China’s new home prices fell 5% year-on-year in January 2025, easing from a 5.3% drop in December. It was the smallest decline since July 2024, as China continues its efforts to address the ongoing property downturn. The market also continued to benefit from enthusiasm surrounding DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence advancements, with major Chinese companies adopting its technology. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.27% to 22,913 in early trade on Wednesday, retreating from the previous session’s rally. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.33% to 76,263 in early deals on Wednesday, after being flat in the previous session, with almost all sectors trading in the green except tech and pharmaceuticals. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.73% to close at 8,419 on Wednesday, marking its third straight day of losses. The decline was driven by the Reserve Bank of Australia's hawkish rate cut, which continued to weigh on market sentiment.The Australian dollar Australia's seasonally adjusted wage price index increased by 3.2% year-over-year in Q4 of 2024, slowing from an upwardly revised 3.6% growth in Q3 and matching market forecasts of a 3.2% gain.

The Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) recent decision to cut its Official Cash Rate (OCR) was widely expected, yet it has sparked a notable rally in the AUD/JPY currency pair. For crypto enthusiasts watching broader market trends, this Forex action highlights how central bank policies and global economic factors can create ripples across all financial markets, including the volatile crypto sphere. Let’s dive into the details of this pivotal RBA move and its impact on the Forex landscape. Why is the AUD/JPY Pair Gaining Momentum After the RBA Rate Cut? The AUD/JPY cross is experiencing bullish momentum, climbing above the 96.50 mark during Tuesday’s Asian trading session. This upward trajectory follows the Reserve Bank of Australia’s decision to lower its benchmark interest rate. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors fueling this Forex reaction: Expected Rate Cut Delivered: The RBA implemented a 0.25% cut, bringing the OCR down to 4.10%. This move, while anticipated by market analysts, marks the first rate reduction in four years, signaling a potential shift in the RBA’s monetary policy stance. Aussie Dollar Strength: Despite the rate cut, the Australian Dollar (AUD) has strengthened against the Japanese Yen (JPY). This might seem counterintuitive, but in the absence of overly dovish forward guidance from the RBA, the market interpreted the move as priced in, leading to a relief rally. Trump Tariff Delay Boost: Adding to the AUD’s positive momentum is the news of a delay in former US President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariff implementation. This development has eased concerns about immediate trade tensions, providing a further lift to the Aussie. Understanding the RBA Rate Cut and its Forex Implications The Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) decision to cut rates is a significant event in Forex markets. Here’s what you need to know: End of a Hiking Cycle: This rate cut effectively signals the end of the RBA’s aggressive interest rate hiking cycle aimed at combating inflation. The move suggests the central bank believes inflationary pressures are moderating enough to warrant easing monetary policy. Economic Growth Focus: By lowering interest rates, the RBA aims to stimulate economic growth. Lower borrowing costs can encourage businesses to invest and consumers to spend, potentially boosting economic activity. Impact on Australian Dollar: Typically, interest rate cuts can weaken a currency. However, as the market had largely priced in this RBA rate cut, and the RBA did not signal further immediate easing, the AUD experienced a temporary boost. The longer-term impact on the Australian Dollar will depend on future economic data and RBA policy signals. Japanese Yen’s Counterforce: Bank of Japan Rate Hike Expectations While the Australian Dollar is gaining ground, the Japanese Yen (JPY) is facing headwinds but also has potential support factors. The key element to consider is the rising expectation of future interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). BoJ Policy Shift Anticipation: Market participants are increasingly betting on the Bank of Japan to move away from its ultra-loose monetary policy and implement rate hikes. This anticipation stems from growing concerns about inflation in Japan and the BoJ’s shifting rhetoric. Potential JPY Strength: If the BoJ does raise interest rates, it would likely strengthen the Japanese Yen. Higher interest rates attract foreign investment, increasing demand for the currency. AUD/JPY Balance: The AUD/JPY pair’s future direction will likely be determined by the interplay between RBA’s easing cycle and the potential BoJ tightening. If BoJ rate hike expectations intensify, it could limit the AUD/JPY upside or even trigger a reversal. Key Factors Driving the Australian Dollar: A Forex Trader’s Guide For Forex traders and those interested in the AUD, understanding the key drivers of the Australian Dollar is crucial. Here’s a quick guide: RBA Interest Rate Decisions: As demonstrated by the recent rate cut, the Reserve Bank of Australia’s monetary policy decisions are a primary driver of the Australian Dollar’s value. Higher rates generally support the AUD, while lower rates can weigh on it. Iron Ore Prices: Australia is a major exporter of iron ore. Fluctuations in iron ore prices significantly impact Australia’s export revenue and, consequently, the Australian Dollar. Higher iron ore prices are typically AUD-positive. Chinese Economic Health: China is Australia’s largest trading partner. The health and growth of the Chinese economy directly influence demand for Australian exports, including iron ore, impacting the AUD. Strong Chinese growth is generally positive for the Aussie. Trade Balance: Australia’s trade balance, the difference between exports and imports, reflects the demand for the AUD. A positive trade balance indicates strong demand for Australian goods and services, supporting the currency. Global Risk Sentiment: The Australian Dollar is often considered a risk-on currency. During periods of positive global risk sentiment, investors tend to favor currencies like the AUD, while in risk-off environments, safe-haven currencies like the JPY or USD may be preferred. Iron Ore, Trade Balance, and China’s Economy: How They Influence the Australian Dollar Let’s delve deeper into how Iron Ore prices, the Trade Balance, and the Chinese Economy influence the Australian Dollar, providing a more comprehensive picture for Forex market participants: Iron Ore Prices Iron ore, Australia’s top export, significantly impacts the Australian Dollar. As a primary ingredient in steel production, demand is heavily influenced by global industrial activity, particularly in China. When iron ore prices rise, Australia’s export earnings increase, boosting demand for the AUD and generally pushing its value higher. Conversely, falling iron ore prices can weaken the Australian Dollar. Trade Balance A positive Trade Balance for Australia indicates that the country is exporting more than it imports. This surplus generates demand for the Australian Dollar as foreign buyers need AUD to purchase Australian exports. A consistently positive Trade Balance is a fundamental factor supporting the long-term value of the Australian Dollar. Conversely, a negative balance can put downward pressure on the currency. Chinese Economy The Chinese economy’s performance is inextricably linked to the Australian Dollar. As China’s economy grows, its demand for raw materials, especially iron ore from Australia, increases. This heightened demand drives up iron ore prices and strengthens the Australian Dollar. Economic slowdowns in China can have the opposite effect, reducing demand for Australian exports and potentially weakening the AUD. Monitoring Chinese economic indicators is therefore crucial for those trading the Australian Dollar. Conclusion: Navigating Forex Markets After the RBA Rate Cut The RBA’s expected rate cut has indeed triggered a reaction in the Forex markets, particularly for the AUD/JPY pair. While the Australian Dollar has seen an initial boost, the outlook remains complex. Factors such as future RBA policy signals, evolving expectations for BoJ rate hikes, and global economic conditions will continue to shape the trajectory of the AUD/JPY and the Australian Dollar in the Forex arena. Traders should closely monitor these dynamics to navigate the evolving landscape and identify potential opportunities and risks in Forex trading.

Many companies like Metaplanet, Strategy, Marathon Digital Holdings, and Galaxy Digital Holdings are some of the top BTC holders right now. The Case for Bitcoin in Corporate Finance Ramaswamy argues that with the era of easy money over, companies and institutions must rethink how they manage capital. He suggests Bitcoin could become a crucial corporate treasury asset, offering long-term value and financial stability. Ramaswamy recently highlighted an interview with Strive Asset Management’s CEO Matt Cole, who predicted that 2025 will be a breakthrough year for crypto, calling it “ the year of the Bitcoin treasury company ,” as more businesses consider adding Bitcoin to their financial reserves. In response to Ramaswamy’s Bitcoin strategy, investor Preston Pysh agreed, stating that Bitcoin holdings should be viewed as a company’s new earnings parameter. He pointed out that firms like Strategy and MetaPlanet are already adopting this approach, suggesting that others may soon follow. 100%. The amount of Bitcoin the company can acquire and hold long-term COMPARED to the amount that they already have on their balance sheet is the new EPS.

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) recently made a significant move, cutting interest rates for the first time in four years. But is it all smooth sailing for the Australian Dollar? Let’s dive into the details and see what RBA Governor Michele Bullock had to say, and how it’s all playing out in the forex markets. Australian Dollar Reacts to RBA Rate Cut: A Measured Response The Australian Dollar showed remarkable resilience, barely budging after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announced its decision to lower the Official Cash Rate by 25 basis points to 4.10%. Why such a muted reaction? Experts believe traders had already anticipated this rate cut. This move marks the first reduction in interest rates by the RBA in four years, signaling a shift in monetary policy. But don’t jump to conclusions about aggressive future cuts just yet. Here’s a quick recap of the key events: RBA Rate Cut: The Reserve Bank of Australia lowered the Official Cash Rate by 25 bps to 4.10%. Bullock’s Cautious Tone: RBA Governor Michele Bullock emphasized it’s too early to declare victory over inflation, despite acknowledging the impact of high interest rates. Jobs Market Strength: Bullock highlighted the unexpectedly robust jobs market as a factor influencing future decisions. Big Four Banks Follow Suit: Australia’s major banks (CBA, NAB, ANZ, Westpac) also reduced their interest rates by 25 bps. Inflation Battle: RBA Refrains from Declaring Victory While the rate cut might suggest a loosening of monetary policy, RBA Governor Michele Bullock’s statements paint a more nuanced picture. She clearly stated that it is premature to declare victory over inflation . This cautious approach is crucial for understanding the future trajectory of the Australian Dollar and the Australian economy. Why the Hesitation? Persistent Inflation Risks: Despite recent positive inflation data, the RBA remains wary of upside risks to inflation. Strong Jobs Market: A strong labor market can fuel wage growth, potentially leading to further inflationary pressures. Global Economic Uncertainty: External factors and global economic conditions also play a role in the RBA’s cautious stance. Decoding the Data: Australia’s Inflation Picture Recent inflation data from Australia offers a mixed bag. The December Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed signs of easing price pressures, rising less than anticipated in the last quarter of 2024. The RBA’s preferred measure, the Trimmed Mean CPI, also came in slightly below expectations. Let’s break down the key inflation indicators: Indicator December Data Previous Quarter Quarterly CPI Less than forecast – Trimmed Mean CPI (Quarterly) 0.5% (Expected 0.6%) – Trimmed Mean CPI (Annualized) 3.2% 3.5% While these figures indicate a cooling trend, Governor Bullock’s remarks suggest the RBA needs more convincing evidence before confidently declaring inflation under control. Global Factors Influencing the Australian Dollar The Australian Dollar’s movements are not solely determined by domestic factors. Global events and the strength of other currencies, particularly the US Dollar, play a significant role. US Dollar Strength and Treasury Yields: US Dollar Index (DXY): The DXY has been trending upwards, indicating renewed strength in the US Dollar. US Treasury Yields Rise: Increased yields on US Treasury bonds make the US Dollar more attractive to investors. Fed Officials’ Hawkish Stance: Statements from Fed Governors like Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller suggest a cautious approach to US rate cut s, further supporting the US Dollar. Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman warned about persistent upside inflation risks in the US, emphasizing the need for more clarity before considering rate cut s. This hawkish stance from the Fed contrasts with the RBA’s recent rate cut and contributes to the complex dynamics influencing the AUD/USD pair. Technical Outlook for AUD/USD: Navigating the Charts From a technical analysis perspective, the AUD/USD pair is currently trading around 0.6340, exhibiting an upward trend within an ascending channel pattern. This pattern generally suggests a bullish bias. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) further reinforces this outlook, remaining above the 50 level. Key Technical Levels to Watch: Resistance: Upper boundary of ascending channel: 0.6390 Psychological resistance: 0.6400 Support: Nine-day EMA: 0.6316 14-day EMA: 0.6300 Lower boundary of ascending channel: 0.6280 Traders should monitor these levels closely for potential breakouts or breakdowns, which could signal further directional movements in the AUD/USD pair.

Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights The Australian Dollar’s current stability following the RBA rate cut is a testament to market anticipation. However, Governor Bullock’s cautious remarks about inflation suggest that further rate cut s are not guaranteed and highly data-dependent. Traders should closely monitor upcoming economic data releases from both Australia and the US, as well as statements from central bank officials. Actionable Insights for Traders: Stay Data-Driven: Pay close attention to upcoming Australian and US economic data, particularly inflation figures and employment reports. Monitor Central Bank Communication: Keep an eye on speeches and statements from RBA and Federal Reserve officials for clues about future policy direction. Technical Analysis: Utilize technical analysis tools to identify potential entry and exit points for AUD/USD trades, focusing on key support and resistance levels. Risk Management: Implement robust risk management strategies to protect your capital in this volatile market environment. Conclusion: Navigating the Australian Dollar Landscape The Australian Dollar finds itself at an interesting juncture. While the RBA has initiated rate cut s, the central bank remains vigilant about inflation . The global economic landscape, particularly the strength of the US Dollar and the Federal Reserve’s policy stance, adds further complexity. For cryptocurrency and forex traders, staying informed, adaptable, and employing sound risk management will be crucial to navigating the Australian Dollar’s journey ahead.

His recent post includes a chart suggesting that XRP is preparing for a substantial breakout, potentially the largest in its history. The phrase accompanying the post, “Longer The Base, Higher In Space,” echoes the well-known principle popularized by Louise Yamada , suggesting that a prolonged period of price consolidation can lead to an explosive breakout. The chart displays XRP’s monthly price movement against the U.S. dollar on Bitstamp. A key observation is the extended period of price consolidation between early 2018 and late 2024, forming a strong support base for the asset. True Phrase, once we breakout from this swing low, I expect the next move to be parabolic! Don't expect over $100 but my top would be 2 figures brotha — JD (@jaydee_757) February 17, 2025 The chart highlights XRP’s recent move which broke years of consolidation and sent the asset to a multi-year high of $3.39. This impressive surge began in November, shortly after Donald Trump won the U.S. Presidential election, and former SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced his resignation . XRP Captain emphasizes the gravity of this breakout, highlighting the multi-year consolidation phase as a launch pad for a significant rally. The projection on the chart suggests a future price target of $250, 100x the digital asset’s current price of $2.5 Market Reactions and Alternative Views Following the XRP Captain’s post, another well-known analyst, JD (@jaydee_757), responded with a more conservative outlook. While agreeing with the general premise that a long consolidation can precede a strong breakout, JD expressed skepticism about XRP reaching three-digit price levels. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He stated that once XRP breaks above its current range, he expects a parabolic move but tempered expectations by adding, “Don’t expect over $100 but my top would be 2 figures.” This response reflects the broader sentiment within the crypto community, where expectations for XRP’s price movements vary significantly. Some traders foresee an aggressive rally reminiscent of XRP’s 2017 bull run, while others maintain a more cautious stance, citing market conditions, regulatory concerns, and overall liquidity constraints. However, JD’s conservative target is also significantly greater than the asset’s current price. He recently predicted a move to $27 for the digital asset, and whatever direction it takes, it would still bring life-changing wealth to early investors. If XRP maintains its current trajectory and sustains a breakout above its previous resistance levels, it could lead to a rapid price acceleration, starting a historic rally to new heights.

All eyes were on RBA Governor Michele Bullock as she addressed the press, explaining the rationale behind this significant decision and offering crucial insights into the future interest rate outlook . For crypto investors and Forex traders tracking global economic shifts, Bullock’s speech provides vital clues about the Australian economy and the potential trajectory of the Australian Dollar (AUD). Let’s dive into the key takeaways from this pivotal event. Bullock’s Candid Speech: Gauging the Interest Rate Outlook Governor Bullock’s press conference, a new initiative for the RBA this year, was keenly anticipated. Her frank remarks aimed to clarify the central bank’s stance and manage market expectations following the surprising interest rate cut . Here’s a breakdown of the most critical quotes and their implications: “Cannot declare victory on inflation yet.” Despite the rate cut, Bullock emphasized that the fight against inflation is far from over. This suggests a cautious approach moving forward, with further easing not guaranteed. “Further rate cuts implied by market not guaranteed.” Markets had priced in more rate cuts, but Bullock explicitly stated that these expectations might be premature. Future policy decisions will be heavily data-dependent. “Rate cut was a difficult decision.” This highlights the delicate balancing act the RBA is performing, weighing economic slowdown against persistent inflation. “Further cuts will depend on data.” Economic data will be the ultimate guide for future rate adjustments. Traders should closely monitor upcoming Australian economic releases. “Need to see upside risks to inflation abate a bit, including wage costs.” Wage growth and other inflationary pressures remain concerns. Sustained moderation in these areas is crucial for further easing. These key quotes paint a picture of a central bank cautiously easing policy while remaining vigilant about inflation. The message is clear: don’t expect a rapid series of rate cuts. The RBA will proceed with deliberation, analyzing incoming data to guide each step. Decoding the RBA’s Monetary Policy Statement: A Deep Dive into Australia Interest Rates Prior to Governor Bullock’s press conference, the RBA released its official monetary policy statement, offering a comprehensive view of their economic assessment and the reasoning behind the interest rate cut . Let’s dissect the key points: Summary of the RBA monetary policy statement: Mixed Economic Signals: The RBA noted that inflation and GDP growth have been softer than anticipated, while the labor market has remained stronger. This mixed picture complicates policy decisions. Restrictive Financial Conditions: Current domestic financial conditions are deemed restrictive, with interest rates above neutral levels. However, the neutral rate itself is subject to wide-ranging estimates and may have declined. Labor Market Dynamics: The RBA acknowledges the risk of overestimating excess demand in the labor market. While still tight, there may be more spare capacity than initially thought. Inflation Trends: Q4 trimmed mean inflation was softer than expected, with some easing in housing and service costs. This positive development paved the way for the rate cut. Revised Forecasts: The RBA has cut both inflation and unemployment forecasts. They anticipate lower household spending but expect higher public demand. Key Economic Forecasts: Indicator June 2025 June 2026 June 2027 CPI Inflation 2.4% 3.2% 2.7% Trimmed Mean Inflation 2.7% 2.7% 2.7% GDP Growth 2.0% 2.3% 2.2% Unemployment Rate 4.2% 4.2% 4.2% Wage Growth 3.4% 3.2% 3.1% Note: Forecasts are based on the technical assumption of a cash rate at 4.0% in June 2025, 3.6% in Dec 2025, and 3.4% in June 2026. These forecasts reveal the RBA’s expectation of a gradual return of inflation to their target range, alongside moderate economic growth and a stable unemployment rate. The projected path for the cash rate suggests further easing, but at a measured pace. Navigating Global Uncertainties: US Policies and Inflation Outlook The RBA statement also highlighted external risks, particularly concerning US economic policies. The potential for US tariffs to tighten global financial conditions is a significant concern. Despite domestic disinflationary trends, the inflation outlook remains uncertain due to these global factors. Key takeaways regarding inflation and policy stance: Underlying inflation moderating: Positive signs of disinflation are emerging. Outlook remains uncertain: Global risks and domestic uncertainties persist. Sustainably returning inflation to target is the priority: The RBA’s commitment to price stability remains unwavering. Cautious approach: The board will continue to rely on data and risk assessments to guide decisions, signaling a cautious approach to further policy easing. Confidence in inflation trajectory: The board is more confident that inflation is moving towards the 2-3% target range. Upside risks remain: Easing policy too quickly could stall disinflation and keep inflation above target. The RBA’s message is one of cautious optimism. They acknowledge progress on inflation but are wary of prematurely declaring victory. The decision to cut rates was a measured adjustment, removing “a little of the policy restrictiveness” while remaining prepared to respond to evolving economic conditions. AUD/USD Reaction: A Glimpse into Market Sentiment on Australia Interest Rates The currency markets reacted swiftly to the RBA’s decision. The Australian Dollar (AUD) initially strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) following the interest rate cut , indicating a potential “hawkish cut” interpretation by traders. AUD/USD Price Movement: Initial Bid: The AUD/USD pair saw a fresh bid upon the RBA announcement. Modest Gains: The pair added 0.05% on the day, trading around 0.6360. The table below illustrates the Australian Dollar’s performance against other major currencies: Australian Dollar (AUD) Percentage Change Today: Currency USD EUR GBP JPY CAD AUD NZD CHF USD 0.11% 0.12% 0.30% 0.04% -0.07% 0.36% 0.08% EUR -0.11% 0.00% 0.17% -0.07% -0.18% 0.25% -0.03% GBP -0.12% -0.01% 0.19% -0.08% -0.19% 0.24% -0.04% JPY -0.30% -0.17% -0.19% -0.27% -0.38% 0.03% -0.24% CAD -0.04% 0.07% 0.08% 0.27% -0.11% 0.32% 0.04% AUD 0.07% 0.18% 0.19% 0.38% 0.11% 0.42% 0.14% NZD -0.36% -0.25% -0.24% -0.03% -0.32% -0.42% -0.27% CHF -0.08% 0.03% 0.04% 0.24% -0.04% -0.14% 0.27% The heat map visualization (as described in the original article) further illustrates these currency movements, providing a quick overview of relative strength and weakness. Pre-Announcement Expectations: Anticipating the Australia Interest Rates Decision Leading up to the announcement, market consensus strongly anticipated a 25 bps interest rate cut . Economic indicators, such as easing core inflation, fueled these expectations. However, solid employment growth presented a counterargument, adding complexity to the RBA’s decision-making process. Market Expectations vs. RBA Action: Expected Cut: Market participants widely anticipated a 25 bps rate cut. Inflation Data: Easing core inflation in Q4 2024 supported rate cut expectations. Employment Strength: Robust employment growth acted as a potential headwind against rate cuts. Cautious Approach Anticipated: Markets expected the RBA to maintain a cautious stance on further easing, even with a rate cut. As predicted, the RBA delivered the expected 25 bps cut but emphasized a data-dependent and cautious approach moving forward. This “hawkish cut” scenario, where a rate cut is accompanied by cautious forward guidance, can explain the initial AUD strength. Expert Analysis: Valeria Bednarik’s Perspective on AUD/USD and Interest Rate Outlook Valeria Bednarik, Chief Analyst at Bitcoin World, offered insightful commentary on the AUD/USD pair and the broader implications of the RBA’s decision. She noted the technical bullish stance of AUD/USD and highlighted the influence of US Dollar weakness, partly driven by uncertainty surrounding US fiscal policies and potential tariffs. Key points from Valeria Bednarik’s analysis: AUD/USD Bullish Stance: The pair exhibited technical strength even before the RBA announcement. USD Weakness: US Dollar weakness, linked to US fiscal policy uncertainty, supported AUD/USD. US Tariffs Impact: Uncertainty about the impact of US tariffs on the Australian economy is a factor for the RBA. Technical Levels: Bednarik identified key resistance levels for AUD/USD, including 0.6373, 0.6430, and 0.6470, and support levels at 0.6300 and 0.6230. Bednarik’s analysis underscores the complex interplay of domestic and global factors influencing the AUD/USD exchange rate. The RBA’s interest rate outlook is just one piece of the puzzle, with global economic developments and US policy decisions playing significant roles. Interest Rates FAQs: Understanding the Basics To further clarify the context of the RBA’s decision, let’s address some frequently asked questions about interest rates: What are interest rates? Interest rates are the cost of borrowing money, charged by financial institutions on loans. They are also the returns paid to savers. Central banks like the RBA set base lending rates to manage inflation and stimulate economic activity. How do interest rates impact currencies? Generally, higher interest rates can strengthen a country’s currency by attracting foreign investment. How do interest rates influence the price of Gold? Higher interest rates can negatively impact gold prices because they increase the opportunity cost of holding gold compared to interest-bearing assets. They also tend to strengthen the US Dollar, in which gold is priced, further lowering gold prices. What is the Fed Funds rate? The Fed Funds rate is the overnight lending rate between US banks, set by the Federal Reserve. It’s a key benchmark rate influencing global financial markets. Conclusion: A Cautious Step Towards Monetary Easing and the Future Interest Rate Outlook Governor Bullock’s speech and the RBA’s monetary policy statement provide a clear, albeit cautious, picture of the interest rate outlook for Australia. The 25 bps cut marks a shift towards monetary easing, but the RBA is signaling a slow and data-dependent approach. While acknowledging progress on inflation, the central bank remains vigilant about upside risks and global uncertainties. For cryptocurrency and Forex traders, understanding these nuances is crucial for navigating market volatility and making informed investment decisions. The Australian Dollar’s reaction suggests that markets are interpreting the RBA’s move as a measured and potentially slow easing cycle, rather than the start of aggressive rate cuts. Keep a close watch on upcoming Australian economic data releases – they will be the key determinants of the RBA’s next steps and the future direction of Australia interest rates .

The USD/CHF pair is making waves in the currency market, showcasing a significant climb as renewed demand for the US Dollar takes center stage. In today’s fast-paced financial landscape, understanding the dynamics between these currencies is crucial for informed trading decisions. Let’s dissect the factors propelling this movement and what it means for your Forex market analysis. USD/CHF Rallies on Renewed US Dollar Demand The USD/CHF pair has experienced a notable upswing, currently hovering near the 0.9030 mark in the early European trading session. This surge is primarily fueled by a robust US Dollar, buoyed by expectations of a more hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve (Fed). Investors are keenly awaiting the NY Empire State Manufacturing Index for February and a speech from Fed’s Mary Daly later today, both of which could offer further clues into the Fed’s monetary policy outlook. Last week’s data revealing a sharp increase in US consumer prices – the highest in nearly 18 months – has solidified the notion that the Fed is unlikely to rush into rate cuts, further bolstering the US Dollar Demand. ANZ strategists suggest, “An extended pause during the first half of this year looks justified and will give the Fed time to assess the impact of trade measures on inflation.” This sentiment underscores the current market expectation of sustained higher interest rates in the US, making dollar-denominated assets more attractive. Geopolitical Tensions and Swiss Franc Safe Haven Status While US Dollar Demand is a significant driver, geopolitical risks are also playing a crucial role in the USD/CHF dynamic. Recent escalations in the Middle East, including airstrikes in southern Lebanon, are raising concerns about regional instability. Historically, such uncertainties tend to boost safe-haven currencies, and the Swiss Franc is a prime example. Investors often flock to the Swiss Franc Safe Haven during times of global turmoil due to Switzerland’s stable economy, strong financial system, and neutral political stance. However, in the current scenario, the strengthening US Dollar is overshadowing some of the typical safe-haven appeal of the Swiss Franc. The tug-of-war between these two forces – US Dollar strength and safe-haven flows – is creating interesting trading opportunities and challenges within the Forex market analysis. Decoding the Swiss Franc: Your Safe Haven Deep Dive The Swiss Franc (CHF) isn’t just another currency; it’s a financial powerhouse and a beacon of stability in the often-turbulent world of Forex. Let’s answer some frequently asked questions to understand its unique position: What factors drive the Swiss Franc’s value? The Swiss Franc’s value is influenced by a blend of factors, making it a fascinating subject for Forex market analysis: Global Market Sentiment: As a safe-haven currency, CHF strengthens during times of global uncertainty and risk aversion. Swiss Economic Health: Switzerland’s robust economy, characterized by low inflation and a strong export sector, underpins the Franc’s value. Swiss National Bank (SNB) Actions: SNB’s monetary policy decisions, particularly interest rate adjustments, have a direct impact on the CHF. Eurozone Dynamics: Due to strong economic ties with the Eurozone, the Swiss Franc often mirrors the Euro’s movements. Why is the Swiss Franc considered a safe-haven currency? The Swiss Franc’s safe-haven status is deeply rooted in Switzerland’s fundamental strengths: Economic Stability: Switzerland boasts a consistently stable and prosperous economy. Strong Export Sector: A significant export-oriented economy contributes to a healthy current account surplus. Large Central Bank Reserves: Substantial reserves provide a buffer against economic shocks. Political Neutrality: Switzerland’s long-standing policy of neutrality in global conflicts enhances its image as a safe and stable haven. During periods of market stress, investors seek refuge in CHF, driving up its value against currencies perceived as riskier. How do SNB decisions impact the Swiss Franc? The Swiss National Bank (SNB) plays a crucial role in managing the Swiss Franc’s value. Key aspects include: Monetary Policy Meetings: The SNB meets quarterly to set monetary policy, aiming for inflation below 2%. Interest Rate Adjustments: Raising interest rates typically strengthens CHF by attracting investors seeking higher yields. Conversely, lower rates tend to weaken CHF. Inflation Control: SNB’s focus on maintaining low inflation reinforces confidence in the Swiss Franc. Economic Data and Swiss Franc Valuation Swiss economic data is a vital indicator for Forex market analysis and CHF valuation: Key Economic Indicators: GDP growth, inflation rates, unemployment figures, and trade balance data are closely watched. Impact on CHF: Strong economic data generally supports CHF, while weak data can lead to depreciation. Market Sensitivity: Even minor deviations from expected economic figures can trigger noticeable movements in CHF. Eurozone Monetary Policy’s Influence on CHF The Eurozone’s economic and monetary policies have a significant spillover effect on the Swiss Franc: Economic Interdependence: Switzerland’s economy is heavily reliant on the Eurozone, its primary trading partner. EUR/CHF Correlation: The Euro and Swiss Franc exhibit a high degree of correlation, often moving in tandem. ECB Policy Impact: European Central Bank (ECB) decisions on interest rates and monetary policy directly influence the Euro, and consequently, the Swiss Franc. Understanding these interconnected factors is paramount for anyone engaged in Forex market analysis and trading the USD/CHF pair. Navigating the USD/CHF Landscape: Key Takeaways In conclusion, the recent surge in USD/CHF is a multifaceted event driven by: Resurgent US Dollar Demand: Fueled by hawkish Fed expectations and strong US economic data. Geopolitical Risks: Adding a layer of complexity and potentially boosting Swiss Franc’s safe-haven appeal, though currently overshadowed by dollar strength. Swiss Franc Fundamentals: Long-term stability underpinned by Switzerland’s strong economy and SNB policies. For traders, monitoring US economic data, Fed communications, and geopolitical developments is crucial for anticipating USD/CHF movements. The interplay between US Dollar Demand and the Swiss Franc Safe Haven status will continue to shape this pair’s trajectory in the Forex market.

This move, the first in four years, has sent ripples through the financial markets, prompting intense scrutiny of the RBA’s policy outlook . For those tracking the pulse of the crypto and forex markets, Bullock’s words offer vital clues about the future trajectory of the Australian economy and the Australian Dollar (AUD). Let’s dive into the key takeaways from this pivotal event. Decoding the RBA Governor Speech: Key Highlights Michele Bullock’s press conference, a new initiative for the RBA, aimed to provide transparency and clarity behind the recent interest rate cut . Here are the essential points distilled from her remarks: Inflation Caution: Despite the rate cut, Governor Bullock emphasized, “Cannot declare victory on inflation yet.” This statement underscores the RBA’s ongoing concern about inflationary pressures, suggesting a measured approach to future policy adjustments. Market Expectations vs. RBA Stance: While markets have priced in further rate cuts, Bullock cautioned that these are “not guaranteed.” This divergence highlights potential volatility and uncertainty in the AUD’s future movements. Difficult Decision: The Governor acknowledged the weight of the decision, stating the interest rate cut was “a difficult decision,” indicating a careful balancing act between stimulating the economy and controlling inflation . Data-Driven Future: Looking ahead, Bullock stressed that “further cuts will depend on data.” This reinforces the RBA’s commitment to a flexible, data-dependent approach, meaning upcoming economic indicators will be crucial for market direction. Global Economic Risks: Bullock addressed external factors, noting that “Tariff threats are unpredictable, would be bad for economic activity,” and acknowledging the potential impact of global trade tensions on Australia’s economic landscape. Limited Cutting Room: Interestingly, Bullock mentioned, “May not have as much room to cut, since we did not hike as far as others.” This suggests a potentially shallower easing cycle compared to other central banks, which could have implications for the AUD’s relative strength. Consensus Decision: Finally, to reassure markets, Bullock confirmed, “The decision to cut was consensus,” signaling a unified front within the RBA board. The Economic Backdrop: Why the Interest Rate Cut Now? The RBA’s decision to lower the Official Cash Rate (OCR) to 4.1% reflects a nuanced assessment of the Australian economy. Here’s a snapshot of the factors influencing this move: Economic Indicator Details Inflation and GDP Softer than expected, indicating cooling economic pressures. Labour Market Stronger than anticipated, yet concerns about spare capacity are emerging. Domestic Financial Conditions Assessed as restrictive, with rates above neutral levels. Q4 Trimmed Mean Inflation Softer than forecast, showing progress in curbing price rises. Forecast Adjustments RBA cuts inflation and unemployment forecasts, anticipating reduced household spending but increased public demand. These factors, combined with global economic uncertainties, painted a picture where a modest interest rate cut was deemed appropriate to provide some economic stimulus while remaining vigilant about inflation . Navigating the Policy Outlook: What’s Next for the RBA? Governor Bullock’s speech offered a glimpse into the RBA’s forward-looking strategy. Key takeaways regarding the policy outlook include: Data Dependence Reigns Supreme: The RBA will “continue to rely upon the data,” emphasizing that future decisions are not pre-set and will hinge on incoming economic information. This makes monitoring Australian economic releases paramount for traders. Cautious on Further Easing: Despite the current cut, the board remains “cautious on prospects for further policy easing.” This suggests that any subsequent rate reductions will be gradual and conditional. Balancing Inflation and Growth: The RBA is navigating a delicate balance, acknowledging that while “some of the upside risks to inflation appear to have eased,” they also recognize “risks on both sides.” This balancing act will likely define their policy outlook for the foreseeable future. Inflation Target Still Paramount: “Sustainably returning inflation to target is the priority,” Bullock reiterated, reinforcing the RBA’s unwavering commitment to price stability within the 2-3% range. Australian Dollar’s Immediate Reaction: A Forex Perspective The Australian Dollar’s (AUD) reaction to the interest rate cut and Bullock’s speech was closely watched in forex markets. Initially, the AUD experienced a slight uptick, defying expectations of immediate weakness. As observed in the currency strength table, the AUD showed resilience against major currencies post-announcement: Currency Pair % Change (AUD vs. Other Currencies) AUD/USD +0.07% AUD/EUR +0.18% AUD/GBP +0.19% AUD/JPY +0.38% AUD/NZD +0.42% (Strongest) This initial strength could be attributed to the RBA’s cautious tone and the indication that further rate cuts are not a foregone conclusion. The market may be interpreting the interest rate cut as a ‘hawkish cut’ – a reduction accompanied by signals that further easing will be limited. Inflation Victory? Not Yet, Says RBA While inflation figures have shown signs of moderation, Governor Bullock’s consistent message was one of cautious optimism, not outright victory. The RBA’s forecasts reflect this stance: Forecast June 2025 June 2026 June 2027 CPI Inflation 2.4% 3.2% 2.7% Trimmed Mean Inflation 2.7% 2.7% 2.7% These projections indicate that while inflation is expected to moderate, it will remain within or slightly above the RBA’s target band for the foreseeable future. This suggests that the battle against inflation is ongoing, and the RBA will maintain a vigilant approach. Conclusion: Navigating the Post-Rate Cut Landscape Governor Bullock’s speech following the interest rate cut provides a comprehensive overview of the RBA’s current thinking and policy outlook . The message is clear: the RBA has initiated a cautious easing cycle, driven by moderating inflation and softer economic growth. However, victory over inflation is not yet declared, and future policy moves will be heavily data-dependent. For traders, this means close attention to Australian economic data releases and RBA communications will be crucial for anticipating the Australian Dollar’s next moves. The balance between supporting economic growth and controlling inflation will continue to shape the RBA’s decisions and the trajectory of the AUD in the months ahead.

Trump’s post highlighted what is being referred to as the “Trump Effect”—a growing sentiment that his influence is making the U.S. more favorable to crypto. Specifically, his mention of Ripple and XRP has intensified market speculation and raised questions about what this shift could mean for the future of digital assets in the country. Trump just posted about #XRP . I checked it out. It’s still there pic.twitter.com/XTlg8MQJQM — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) February 19, 2025 ‘Trump Effect’ on Crypto Trump’s TruthSocial post stated: “Donald Trump effect bumps Ripple Labs U.S. deals, XRP gains. This shift in focus towards the U.S. market is part of Ripple’s response to the ‘Trump Effect,’ which is believed to make crypto more favorable in the U.S.” Trump’s recent statement has sparked renewed debate about his potential impact on the cryptocurrency regulatory environment. While he was once critical of digital assets, his recent comments suggest a softened stance, with many speculating that a Trump-backed administration could be more open to fostering crypto innovation. The “Trump Effect” suggests businesses in the blockchain and crypto space now see the U.S. market with renewed optimism. Ripple Labs, a company that has faced intense regulatory scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , is among those adjusting their strategies in response to the shifting political winds. Ripple’s Renewed Focus on the U.S. Market Ripple has historically navigated significant regulatory challenges in the United States, most notably its prolonged legal battle with the SEC over whether XRP should be classified as a security. Recently, these hurdles pushed the company to expand aggressively in international markets, where regulations were often more favorable. However, Trump’s post suggests that Ripple is now repositioning itself to engage more actively in the U.S. market. This shift may indicate growing confidence that the regulatory environment could improve, particularly if Trump or his allies gain more influence over financial policies. A more favorable regulatory stance could encourage Ripple to strengthen its partnerships with U.S.-based financial institutions, expand its services domestically, and integrate further into mainstream fiscal systems. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s price movements often reflect broader sentiment around Ripple’s legal and regulatory standing. The prospect of a Trump-backed shift in policy is fueling optimism among traders and long-term holders, as clarity on regulations is one of the most significant factors affecting crypto markets. If Ripple can operate with fewer restrictions in the U.S., it could significantly enhance XRP’s utility and adoption, leading to sustained price appreciation. The Future of Crypto Under Trump’s Influence The intersection of politics and cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly influential, and Trump’s remarks about Ripple and XRP are a testament to that. If the “Trump Effect” continues to drive market sentiment, it could encourage other crypto firms to re-engage with the U.S. market, potentially leading to greater investment, innovation, and mainstream adoption. While it remains to be seen how regulatory policies will evolve, Trump’s post has undoubtedly placed Ripple and XRP in the spotlight. Whether this momentum translates into long-term growth will depend on how the political landscape unfolds and whether tangible regulatory changes accompany the growing optimism surrounding crypto’s future in the United States.

This bullish momentum is largely attributed to a wave of market optimism sweeping across global trading floors. But what’s fueling this surge, and can it last? Let’s dive into the factors propelling EUR/JPY and what to expect next. EUR/JPY Rises on Market Optimism The primary catalyst behind the EUR/JPY ascent is the postponement of former US President Trump’s proposed reciprocal tariffs. This news has injected a dose of confidence into the market, weakening the safe-haven appeal of the Japanese Yen (JPY). As traders shed their risk-averse positions, the JPY depreciates, providing a tailwind for the EUR/JPY pair. However, this market optimism might face headwinds. The Japanese Yen could find renewed strength as the Bank of Japan (BoJ) increasingly hints at a shift towards a more hawkish monetary policy. Bank of Japan’s Hawkish Signals and JPY Support Despite the current upbeat sentiment, the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) evolving stance presents a significant factor for the EUR/JPY outlook. Recent economic data from Japan, particularly a stronger-than-expected Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report, has emboldened expectations for a change in the BoJ’s ultra-loose monetary policy. Key points to consider regarding the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and its impact on the JPY: Rising Rate Hike Bets: Markets are now anticipating a potential 37 basis points rate increase by the BoJ in 2025. This expectation is driving up yields on Japanese government bonds. 10-Year JGB Yields Surge: The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese Government Bond has reached its highest level since April 2010, reflecting increased investor anticipation of tighter monetary policy. Hawkish Tone: Statements and signals from BoJ officials are increasingly interpreted as hawkish, suggesting a growing inclination to normalize policy and combat inflation. This hawkish pivot by the Bank of Japan could provide substantial support to the Japanese Yen, potentially limiting the upside for the EUR/JPY pair and even triggering a reversal if these expectations solidify. Euro Challenges Amid ECB Rate Cut Outlook While market optimism and JPY weakness are boosting EUR/JPY, the Euro (EUR) itself faces its own set of challenges. The European Central Bank (ECB) appears to be on a different trajectory compared to the potential hawkish shift at the Bank of Japan. Here’s a look at the Euro’s headwinds: ECB Rate Cut Confidence: Several ECB officials remain comfortable with the current outlook, anticipating possibly three more interest rate cuts this year. This follows a recent 25 basis point reduction, bringing the key rate to 2.75%. Divergent Monetary Policy: The contrast between a potentially hawkish BoJ and a dovish ECB creates a divergence in monetary policy, which typically impacts currency valuations. A dovish ECB could weigh on the Euro. However, the Euro could find unexpected support from geopolitical developments. A potential ceasefire in Ukraine and the resumption of gas supplies to Europe could significantly bolster the Euro’s value. JP Morgan analysts suggest that in such a scenario, the EUR/USD pair could appreciate by as much as 5%, which would indirectly support the EUR/JPY as well. Interest Rates and Forex Dynamics: A Quick Guide To better understand the forces at play in the Forex market, particularly concerning EUR/JPY, it’s crucial to grasp the fundamentals of interest rates and their influence on currencies. What are Interest Rates? Interest rates are the cost of borrowing money. Central banks, like the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank, use interest rates as a tool to manage inflation and stimulate or cool down the economy. How do Interest Rates Impact Currencies? Higher interest rates generally attract foreign investment, as investors seek better returns on their capital. This increased demand for a country’s assets strengthens its currency. Conversely, lower interest rates can make a currency less attractive, leading to depreciation. Interest Rates and Gold: Rising interest rates can negatively impact gold prices. Gold is a non-yielding asset, meaning it doesn’t generate interest . When interest rates rise, the opportunity cost of holding gold (instead of interest -bearing assets) increases, potentially leading investors to sell gold. The Fed Funds Rate: In the United States, the Fed Funds rate is a key benchmark. It’s the overnight interest rate at which banks lend to each other. Monitored closely by markets, expectations surrounding future Fed Funds rate movements, tracked by tools like the CME FedWatch, significantly influence financial market behavior. Navigating the EUR/JPY Landscape The EUR/JPY pair is currently navigating a complex landscape influenced by market optimism , evolving central bank policies, and geopolitical factors. While the postponement of tariffs has provided an initial boost, the potential hawkish shift at the Bank of Japan and the dovish stance of the ECB create counteracting forces. For Forex traders, monitoring these key elements is crucial: BoJ Policy Signals: Pay close attention to statements and actions from the Bank of Japan for further clues about their monetary policy direction. ECB Communications: Track ECB pronouncements regarding future rate cuts and their assessment of the Eurozone economy. Geopolitical Developments: Keep an eye on any progress towards a resolution in Ukraine, as this could significantly impact the Euro. Economic Data: Regularly review economic data releases from both Japan and the Eurozone, as these can influence central bank decisions and currency valuations. In conclusion, the EUR/JPY’s recent surge is a testament to the power of market optimism . However, the path ahead is likely to be shaped by the tug-of-war between central bank policies and global events. Staying informed and adaptable will be key to navigating this dynamic Forex pair.

Cryptocurrency investors are always looking for signals in broader markets, and precious metals like silver can offer valuable insights. Today, we delve into the **Silver Price Forecast** for XAG/USD, examining whether bulls can finally smash through the crucial **$32.55 barrier**. After a period of consolidation, are we on the verge of an explosive upward trend? Let’s break down the technical analysis and explore what it means for traders. Decoding the Silver Price Forecast: Will XAG/USD Bulls Prevail? Silver (XAG/USD) is currently exhibiting intriguing behavior. After dipping slightly in the Asian session to around $32.00, it’s showing resilience, bouncing back to the $32.35-$32.40 region. While it’s hovering below last Friday’s peak (the highest since late October), this sideways movement could be more than just stagnation. Could it be a **bullish** consolidation phase, setting the stage for a powerful surge? Looking at the bigger picture, despite some sharp spikes, XAG/USD has largely been confined within a familiar **trading range** for about two weeks. Given the strong upward momentum seen earlier in the year, this consolidation might be a healthy pause before the next leg up. Furthermore, positive signals from daily chart oscillators reinforce the idea that the path of least resistance is upwards. But, patience is key. The Critical $32.55 Barrier: What Happens Next? Before jumping to conclusions about a major rally, it’s crucial to watch the **$32.55 barrier**. This horizontal resistance level is the key to unlocking further gains. A sustained move beyond this point could signal a significant shift in momentum. If silver can decisively break above $32.55, we could see: Initial Target: $33.00. This is the immediate psychological level to overcome. Next Hurdle: $33.35-$33.40. Last Friday’s swing high presents the next resistance zone. Eyes on $34.00 and Beyond. Beyond $33.40, we could see a rapid ascent towards $34.00, followed by intermediate hurdles at $34.45 and potentially reaching for the multi-year peak around $35.00 touched in October. Therefore, traders should keenly observe if the **bulls** can muster enough strength to push XAG/USD convincingly above $32.55. This breakout would likely attract more buyers and fuel the upward trajectory. Understanding Support Levels: Where Could Silver Find a Floor? On the flip side, it’s important to be aware of potential downside risks and key support levels. Currently, the $32.00-$31.90 region appears to be acting as strong immediate support. Below this, we have: $31.75-$31.70 Range. This is the lower boundary of the current short-term **trading range**. 100-day SMA around $31.20. The 100-day Simple Moving Average provides dynamic support. Psychological $31.00 Level. A break below this could trigger further selling. A significant drop below $31.00 could shift the short-term bias towards bearish traders, potentially leading to deeper losses. In such a scenario, watch for: $30.25 Region. The next relevant support level. Psychological $30.00 Mark. A crucial psychological support level. $29.55-$29.50 Zone. A significant horizontal support zone. However, for now, any corrective dips towards $32.00 could be viewed as buying opportunities, given the prevailing **bullish** technical setup. Silver Price Drivers: Beyond Technicals While technical analysis provides valuable insights, understanding the fundamental drivers of silver prices is equally important. Several factors can influence XAG/USD movements: Factor Impact on Silver Price Safe-Haven Demand (Geopolitical Instability, Recession Fears) Increases silver price (though less than gold) Interest Rates Lower interest rates tend to boost silver prices (yieldless asset) US Dollar (USD) Strength Stronger USD typically suppresses silver prices; weaker USD lifts prices Industrial Demand (Electronics, Solar Energy) Rising industrial demand can increase prices Investment Demand (ETFs, Physical Silver) Increased investment demand drives prices up Gold Prices Silver prices generally follow gold’s price movements Silver FAQs: Your Quick Guide to Silver Investing Why do people invest in Silver? Silver is a time-tested precious metal, serving as a store of value and a medium of exchange throughout history. Investors often turn to silver to diversify their portfolios, recognizing its intrinsic value and potential as an inflation hedge. You can invest in physical silver (coins, bars) or through ETFs that track silver prices. Which factors influence Silver prices? A wide array of factors can move silver prices. Economic uncertainty or recession fears boost silver’s safe-haven appeal. Lower interest rates are generally positive for silver. The strength of the US dollar (USD) plays a significant role, as XAG/USD is priced in dollars. Industrial demand, mining supply, and recycling rates also contribute to price fluctuations. How does industrial demand affect Silver prices? Silver’s exceptional electrical conductivity makes it vital in industries like electronics and solar energy. Surges in industrial demand can drive prices higher, while declines can lower them. Economic dynamics in major industrial nations like the US, China, and India significantly impact silver demand. How do Silver prices react to Gold’s moves? Silver prices typically mirror gold’s price movements due to their shared safe-haven status. The Gold/Silver ratio can offer insights into relative valuation. A high ratio might suggest silver is undervalued compared to gold, and vice versa. Conclusion: Is Silver Ready to Surge? The **Silver Price Forecast** for XAG/USD is delicately poised. **Bulls** are waiting for a decisive break above the **$32.55 barrier** to confirm the next leg of the upward trend. While the technical setup looks promising, traders should remain vigilant and monitor price action around key levels. Keep an eye on the $32.55 resistance and the $32.00 support. A breakout could signal an exciting opportunity in the silver market, while a breakdown could lead to further consolidation or even a correction. Stay tuned for potential explosive moves in XAG/USD!

Table of Contents Solana technical analysis amid market pressures Cutoshi thrives on DeFi powers and meme appeal Cutoshi presale stuns market observers Solana’s recent congestion crisis has yielded adverse effects with the altcoin losing a significant share of its market value. Trading at $173.20 at press time, analysts advocate cautious investment and diversification into more promising newcomers like Cutoshi (CUTO). Considering the history of Solana’s congestion crisis and its ripple effect, investors are following these experts’ advice and diversifying into fast-rising projects like Cutoshi. This deflationary meme coin presents a project with DeFi utility in addition to its meme roots. Solana technical analysis amid market pressures SOL’s price suffered a significant price decline of almost 36% in the past month, no thanks to macroeconomic tension. This top altcoin now faces resistance at $180, with support near $170. Despite recent price declines, some Solana traders still cite bullish signals like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 45, indicating undervaluation and SOL trading above its 200-day moving average ($182.70). However, VanEck cautions that SOL’s growth relies on M2 money supply expansion, a metric bound to inflation and crypto demand. On-chain activity remains solid as Solana processed $13 billion in daily transactions this week, taking up 50% of global blockchain volume. Yet, critics point out certain risks, such as SOL’s open interest surging to $2.53 billion, raising liquidation concerns if the crypto’s price drops. The network’s congestion history also leaves doubts in investors’ minds despite institutional interest and ecosystem optimism.

When is the Cut?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bank-of-america-surveyed-fund-managers-what-will-us-interest-rates-be-in-2025-when-is-the-cut/,"A recent Bank of America survey of global fund managers found that a majority of investors predict the Fed will cut interest rates in 2025. According to the survey conducted in February, 77% of fund managers expect a rate cut, while 46% predict two cuts, 27% one cut and 4% three cuts. Meanwhile, 19% of respondents believe interest rates will remain unchanged, while only 1% predict a rate hike. The rate cut expectations come amid ongoing inflationary pressures. January inflation figures that beat estimates led to a sharp decline in stock markets and a rise in borrowing costs. These market moves reflect concerns that the Fed could keep rates high for longer than previously expected. Related News: High Volatility Dominates Bitcoin Price: Analytics Firm Identifies Key Levels to Maintain and Exceed Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, said the latest inflation data supports the view that underlying price pressures remain a problem. “The Fed will view the January high inflation data as confirmation that price pressures continue to bubble beneath the surface of the economy,” Adams said in a note to clients. “This would reinforce the Fed’s intention to at least slow and possibly even end rate cuts in 2025.” RSM US chief economist Joseph Brusuelas shared a similar view, revising his forecast to a single rate cut in December. *This is not investment advice.

The EUR/JPY pair is making waves, surging towards the 159.00 mark. What’s fueling this impressive climb? It’s all about market optimism and how global economic factors are influencing currency valuations. Let’s dive into the details of why the Euro is gaining ground against the Japanese Yen and what could potentially shape its future trajectory. Decoding the EUR/JPY Surge: Market Optimism Takes Center Stage The EUR/JPY pair’s recent ascent is primarily attributed to a boost in market optimism . This positive sentiment stems from the welcome news of a postponement in former US President Donald Trump’s proposed reciprocal tariffs. This development has eased concerns about immediate trade tensions, leading to a depreciation of the safe-haven Japanese Yen (JPY) and consequently, a stronger Euro (EUR) in the pair. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors driving this movement: Trump Tariff Delay: The postponement of tariffs has calmed market anxieties, reducing the appeal of safe-haven currencies like the JPY. JPY Weakness: As risk appetite increases due to reduced trade war fears, the Japanese Yen naturally weakens, benefiting pairs like EUR/JPY. Euro Strength (Relative): While the Eurozone faces its own economic challenges, in this specific scenario, it is comparatively stronger against the weakening Yen. Will Bank of Japan Hawkishness Curb EUR/JPY Gains? While market optimism is currently pushing EUR/JPY higher, the path ahead isn’t without potential obstacles. A significant factor that could temper the pair’s upward momentum is the rising hawkish sentiment surrounding the Bank of Japan (BOJ) . Consider these points regarding the BOJ’s influence: Strong GDP Data: Japan’s unexpectedly robust Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report has fueled speculation about a potential shift in the BOJ’s ultra-loose monetary policy. Rate Hike Expectations: Markets are now pricing in a considerable rate increase by the BOJ in 2025, indicated by the rising yields on Japanese government bonds. JPY Support: Increased hawkishness from the BOJ could provide substantial support to the Japanese Yen, potentially limiting further gains for EUR/JPY and even triggering a reversal. The increasing probability of BOJ rate hikes can be visualized in the following table representing market expectations: Indicator Current Market Pricing BOJ Rate Hikes in 2025 37 basis points 10-year JGB Yield Highest since April 2010 ECB Rate Cut Outlook: A Headwind for the Euro? On the other side of the EUR/JPY equation, the Euro faces its own set of pressures. Despite the current market optimism driven rally, the European Central Bank (ECB)’s stance on future monetary policy could act as a headwind. Several ECB officials have expressed confidence in the outlook for further ECB rate cuts this year. Here’s what’s weighing on the Euro from the ECB’s perspective: Planned Rate Cuts: ECB officials are signaling at least three more rate cuts in the pipeline following a recent 25 basis point reduction. Divergence with BOJ: The contrast between potential ECB rate cuts and BOJ rate hikes creates a divergence in monetary policy, which can weaken the Euro against the Yen. Economic Challenges: The Eurozone’s economic outlook remains uncertain, justifying the ECB’s dovish stance and potential rate cuts. Geopolitical Wildcard: Ukraine Ceasefire and Euro Gains Amidst these economic factors, a significant geopolitical event could dramatically alter the EUR/JPY landscape. A potential ceasefire in Ukraine and the resumption of gas supplies to Europe could provide a substantial boost to the Euro. Consider this potential game-changer: Ukraine Peace Talks: Reports suggest that US and Russian presidents have agreed to initiate negotiations, with officials meeting in Saudi Arabia. Euro Upside Potential: JP Morgan analysts suggest that a ceasefire could lead to a 5% appreciation in the EUR/USD pair, indicating significant Euro strength. Energy Security: Resumed gas supplies would alleviate energy concerns in Europe, bolstering economic confidence and the Euro. Interest Rates and Currency Dynamics: A Quick Recap To understand the broader context of EUR/JPY movements, it’s crucial to grasp the fundamentals of interest rates and their impact on currencies. How do Interest Rates Influence Currencies? Higher interest rates generally attract global investors, making a country’s currency more appealing and strengthening its value. Central banks use interest rates as a tool to manage inflation and stimulate or cool down the economy. For example, if a central bank raises interest rates to combat inflation, it can lead to increased demand for that country’s currency. Interest Rates and Gold Prices Conversely, higher interest rates can negatively impact gold prices. This is because higher rates increase the opportunity cost of holding gold, which doesn’t yield interest, compared to interest-bearing assets or cash in the bank. Furthermore, higher US interest rates often strengthen the US Dollar, and since gold is priced in USD, a stronger dollar can push gold prices down. The Fed Funds Rate Explained The Fed Funds rate, set by the US Federal Reserve, is a key benchmark in global finance. It’s the overnight rate at which US banks lend to each other. Market expectations for future Fed Funds rate movements, tracked by tools like the CME FedWatch, heavily influence financial market behavior as traders anticipate future monetary policy decisions. Conclusion: Navigating the EUR/JPY Landscape Amidst Optimism and Uncertainty The EUR/JPY pair’s current surge reflects a wave of market optimism , primarily driven by the easing of trade war anxieties. However, this upward trend faces significant counterwinds. The potential for increased hawkishness from the Bank of Japan , contrasted with the ECB’s rate cut outlook, creates a complex and potentially volatile scenario. Geopolitical developments, particularly concerning Ukraine, add another layer of uncertainty and opportunity. Traders should closely monitor these factors to navigate the EUR/JPY landscape effectively. While market optimism is a powerful force, fundamental economic and geopolitical factors will ultimately determine the pair’s long-term direction.

This brings the total number of licensed crypto exchange platforms in Hong Kong to 10. Bullish senior vice president Michael Lau, who also serves as head of global sales, stressed that Hong Kong is an integral business hub. Lau further stated that Bullish has more than 100 staff in Hong Kong. After getting the license, Bullish’s strategy in Hong Kong will focus on institutional business. Bullish gets approval as Consensus goes to Hong Kong for the first time Bullish recently acquired CoinsDesk, an extensive media, events, and index platform that organizes the crypto industry’s major forum, Consensus. For the first time, the Consensus event is taking place on a full scale outside the US. The event has already kicked off and will continue at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre until February 20th. Today, February 19th is the highlight of the event, which is expected to draw approximately 8,000 people. Michael Lau, chairman of Consensus Hong Kong, stressed that the decision to hold Consensus was strategic. In a joint interview with Leung at the offices of InvestHK on February 13, Lau said: “Choosing Hong Kong was a pretty strategic decision because we know that one of the big themes within the whole space is … this technology has enabled [that] traditional finance.” Michael Lau Hong Kong has been keen to highlight its continued support for the virtual asset sector as it showcases its ability and capacity to host major industry events. Currently, stablecoins, which are typically pegged to traditional currencies like the US dollar, are a major topic in the crypto world. Many in the crypto community believe stablecoins have more applications within traditional finance than other cryptocurrencies. Hong Kong is developing stablecoin regulations that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will oversee. More platforms are in the queue of the SFC for approvals to operate in Hong Kong Hong Kong’s commitment to enabling a digital asset economy is evident in its regulatory framework, which includes licensing approved firms that have completed the necessary legal procedures. Currently, eight platforms for virtual asset trading are waiting for approval from the Securities and Futures Commission ( SFC). According to Mr. Yip Chi Hang, the executive director of the SFC’s intermediaries division, the market is becoming explicit about the regulatory body’s licensing standards. He said that licenses will be issued again. However, only applicants who meet the required standards will obtain the licenses. The Consensus event is taking place two months after CoinDesk’s newsroom was marred by controversy over the firing of editors over a story about Tron founder Justin Sun. The article satirically explained Sun’s public eating of a banana that was part of the conceptual artwork Comedian , which the crypto entrepreneur bought for $6.2 million. Hong Kong is shaping its ambitions to become a crypto hub Hong Kong first outlined a plan to become a virtual asset hub in 2022, following Beijing’s sweeping ban on all crypto transactions in mainland China the previous year. Since then, it has launched the first spot crypto exchange-traded funds in Asia and other initiatives. Hong Kong’s Cyberport Web3 network, a state-run business hub promoting digital asset innovation, now features over 270 blockchain firms, having added more than 120 in the past 17 months. The Special Administrative Region of China has also proposed initiatives like exempting crypto gains from taxes for hedge funds, private equity, and family investment vehicles, among other regulations.

Now, their investors are looking for more alternatives that can help them recoup their losses. One of the top options is 1Fuel (OFT) , a new altcoin that is already making major moves in the crypto space with its DEX wallet. It seems like 1Fuel (OFT) might just be the best crypto for investors to buy right now. Let’s take a closer look at why. XRP and SUI Lose Investor Interest Ripple (XRP) and Sui (SUI) investors have been losing a lot of interest in their coins because of the recent declines. In the case of SUI, it has already declined by 14.59% in the past week, leaving investors and Ledger and Core Wallet holders to chase their losses. Meanwhile, XRP has also been dropping, although not as much as SUI. For XRP, in the last month, its value declined by 16.61%, which has caused investors to be disappointed. These coins are no longer offering the high value that they used to, so their investors are looking for other alternatives as the best crypto to buy now. Why 1Fuel (OFT) Has the Potential as the Best As XRP and SUI lose a lot of investor interest, 1Fuel (OFT) has emerged with a lot of potential to be one of the best cryptocurrencies for the year. Its expected to achieve an impressive 100x growth by the end of the year, once it is publicly listed. But why do analysts believe 1Fuel has so much potential? 1Fuel (OFT) stands out as a utility token, supporting a DEX wallet that easily rivals Ledger and Core Wallet and makes it useful for real life financial management. Because of this, the value will continue to rise as a leading altcoin to invest in. The real-world utility is not the only reason, as 1Fuel is backed by a reliable and expert team focused on offering unique features that will revolutionize digital asset management. For instance, the cross-chain transaction feature is something you cant find in other wallets like Core Wallet and Ledger, as they often require third-party tools. But with 1Fuel, you can carry out all transactions from one place. 1Fuel also has widespread community interest, another feature that gives potential to be the best crypto to buy now. Although relying on community interest is not suitable for long-term growth in the crypto space, as investors use the DEX wallet, they will definitely have more interest in 1Fuel OFT. 1Fuel Presale Progress Boosts Investor Confidence The 1Fuel presale is currently running, and has progressed so fast that it is making investors even more confident in its future value. The presale is divided in different stages and stage 1 impressed investors when it completed in just one week. Stage 2 and 3 followed suit with speedy progress, and now stage 4 is almost 20% complete. So far, 1Fuel has sold over 210 million tokens as one of the leading altcoins to invest in. It has also raised a massive $2.2 million now. Investors can now buy the OFT token at a low price of $0.018, and their confidence is especially high because of the DEX wallet that rivals platforms like Ledger and Trust Wallet. Best Time to Buy is Right Now This is the best time for investors to buy into 1Fuel (OFT), especially since this is the presale stage. The token is offered at the lowest price of $0.018, but might just grow by a whooping 100x by the end of the year.

It appears that the newly inducted Trump administration is preparing to revamp the US crypto and trade policies. Recently, the US SEC appointed a special crypto task force to establish a clear cryptocurrency regulation framework. The US government announced trade tariffs against China, Mexico and Canada, and imposed tariffs on foreign aluminum and steel. Interestingly, at a time when the world is discussing whether US president Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President will continue his aggressive economic policies, his nominee for the position of US Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick – known for his pro-Bitcoin and pro-tariff views – has won Senate confirmation in a 51-45 vote. Howard Lutnick Confirmed as US Commerce Secretary Lutnick’s appointment as the US Commerce Secretary has created no surprise in many, closely watching US political developments. In November, 2024 itself, Donald Trump had already shared his intention to nominate Lutnick for the post. For Trump, choosing Lutnick for the post might be a way of repaying the hard work he put in to support the Republican candidate in the US presidential election . This business leader played a crucial role in the Republican election fundraising process during both the 2020 and 2024 presidential campaigns. Many in the business community have welcomed Lutnick’s appointment. Lutnick has been an extremely popular businessman. He was the Chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald and BGC Group. Shortly after his confirmation as the US Commerce Secretary, he stepped down from his business roles to comply with government ethics requirements. As Commerce Secretary, he will manage sensitive areas including economic statistics, census operations, and weather reporting. More importantly, he will be responsible for implementing the new administration’s aggressive import tax strategy. CONFIRMED: @howardlutnick as Secretary of Commerce. Cabinet #17. We have 5 cabinet-level confirmations left to go, plus @Kash_Patel (FBI is under DOJ—so not technically cabinet) https://t.co/2u0As9qKn6 — Markwayne Mullin (@SenMullin) February 18, 2025 Lutnick’s Trade Policy and Support for Tariffs Earlier, there were rumours that Lutnick was one of those who encouraged Donald Trump to go ahead with the aggressive import tax strategy. During the confirmation hearing, Lutnick defended Trump’s tariff strategy strongly as expected, and even denounced concerns about the potential inflationary impact of tariffs. Recently, the Trump administration imposed a 10% tariff on China. Beijing retaliated with a 15% counter-tariff on selected US goods. The US government, which had announced a similar tariff plan against Mexico and Canada February 1, froze the move two days later until March 4. The government even increased taxes on foreign steel and aluminum, indicating clearly that it is determinant to go to any extent to support local industries. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Vivek Ramaswamy Pushes Bitcoin Adoption as Corporate Treasury Asset , Lutnick’s Bitcoin Advocacy and Crypto Support The appointment of Lutnick, renowned for his pro-Bitcoin stance, has triggered great excitement among crypto enthusiasts, especially the Bitcoin community. While speaking at a Bitcoin conference recently, he said: “Bitcoin is like gold and should be free trade everywhere. We will do everything in our power to make it so.” It was under Lutnick’s leadership that Cantor Fitzgerald commenced pro-crypto initiatives like a $2 billion Bitcoin financing operation. The firm’s connection with the crypto industry is not limited to BTC. The firm backs numerous progressive crypto initiatives. It oversees Tether’s US Treasury holdings. Reports suggest that the company purchased a 5% stake in Tether lately. In conclusion, Lutnick’s appointment as US Commerce Secretary marks a significant shift in both trade and crypto policies. His pro-tariff stance aligns with Trump’s economic strategy, while his Bitcoin advocacy excites the crypto community. As he takes charge, his policies could reshape US trade dynamics and crypto regulations, making his tenure one to watch closely. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

On Feb. 19, the official Instagram account for luxury brand Dior uploaded a post promoting a Solana ( SOL ) meme coin dubbed the Dior Official Coin alongside a pump.fun address to access the token. The post was shared to the fashion account’s 46.8 million followers. Many users in the comments section were quick to suspect the account was hacked, while others joked about the Instagram admin needing money. “DIOR OFFICIAL COIN. The exclusive luxury crypto on Pumpfun, Secure, innovative, and ready for the future,” wrote the hacker on the post’s caption, accompanied by a picture of the Dior logo on a black backdrop with the Solana logo looming above it. The post disappeared not long after the account was recovered. At the time of writing, the luxury brand still has not released any official statements acknowledging the social media hack. According to data from GeckoTerminal, the Dior coin was launched on Solana through the popular meme coin launchpad pump.fun on Feb. 19, its value skyrocketed to 138% mere minutes after its launch.

40531740,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=130296,1739950499,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Depressed Japanese Yen: Will Limited Downside Trigger a Powerful Rebound?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/japanese-yen-downside-limited-analysis/,"The Japanese Yen (JPY) finds itself in a delicate situation, navigating a landscape of modest US Dollar (USD) strength and speculation surrounding future moves by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). After briefly touching a one-week high against the US Dollar, the Yen has retreated, leaving investors and traders wondering: is this just a temporary dip, or a sign of deeper weakness? This article delves into the factors influencing the Japanese Yen , exploring why its current depressed state might actually signal a limited downside and potential for future gains. Let’s unpack the dynamics at play and understand what it means for the Forex market. Navigating the Depressed Japanese Yen Amidst Modest US Dollar Strength The Japanese Yen is currently under pressure, a situation highlighted by its recent retreat against the US Dollar. This weakness comes despite the fact that many analysts believe the downside for the JPY might be limited. The USD/JPY pair has edged past the 152.00 mark, indicating a shift towards USD strength. But what’s fueling this dynamic? Several factors are contributing to the Yen’s current position: US Dollar (USD) Buying : A modest resurgence in US Dollar buying is exerting downward pressure on the Yen. This is partly due to easing concerns about immediate reciprocal tariffs from the US, as well as a slight uptick in US Treasury bond yields, making the USD relatively more attractive. Geopolitical Factors : Talks aimed at resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict are also playing a role. Optimism surrounding these discussions reduces demand for safe-haven currencies like the Japanese Yen , as investors become slightly more risk-tolerant. Yield Differentials : While US yields are showing some rebound, the anticipated narrowing of the US-Japan yield differential is a crucial element to consider. The expectation that the BoJ will raise interest rates, coupled with potential Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts, could make the lower-yielding Yen more appealing in the long run. BoJ Rate Hike Expectations: A Potential Lifeline for the JPY? Despite the current headwinds, the anticipation of a BoJ rate hike is a significant factor that could prevent a deeper plunge for the Japanese Yen . Japan’s strong inflation figures and robust Q4 GDP data have solidified expectations for the Bank of Japan to tighten its monetary policy. Markets are already pricing in further interest rate increases by the BoJ before the end of the year. This hawkish stance from the BoJ is in stark contrast to the dovish signals emanating from the US Federal Reserve, creating an interesting dynamic for the USD/JPY pair. Key Points on BoJ Rate Hike Impact: Limiting JPY Depreciation : The expectation of higher interest rates in Japan makes holding Yen-denominated assets more attractive, thus limiting significant depreciation. Narrowing Yield Gap : As the BoJ raises rates and the Fed potentially cuts, the yield differential between US and Japanese bonds will narrow. This reduces the incentive to hold USD over JPY for yield purposes. Investor Confidence : A clear signal of policy tightening from the BoJ could boost investor confidence in the Japanese Yen , attracting investment flows. US Dollar Strength: Is it Sustainable? The recent US Dollar strength is playing a crucial role in the current USD/JPY dynamics. However, questions remain about the sustainability of this USD rebound. While positive news regarding tariffs and Treasury yields are providing short-term support, underlying economic data and Fed policy expectations could limit further USD gains. A surprise drop in US Retail Sales and mixed inflation signals suggest the Fed might be leaning towards rate cuts later in the year. Fed Policy and USD Outlook: Potential Rate Cuts : Market expectations for Fed rate cuts in 2025 are still prevalent, despite recent hawkish comments from some Fed officials. Economic Data Dependency : The Fed’s future policy decisions will heavily rely on incoming economic data, particularly inflation and employment figures. Any signs of further economic slowdown could strengthen the case for rate cuts and weaken the USD. Mixed Fed Signals : Recent statements from Fed officials like Harker, Bowman, and Waller highlight the internal debate within the Fed regarding inflation and the timing of rate cuts, creating uncertainty for the USD outlook. Safe-Haven Demand: Will Geopolitical Risks Resurface? The safe-haven demand for the Japanese Yen is currently subdued due to optimism surrounding Russia-Ukraine talks. However, geopolitical risks are notoriously unpredictable. Any escalation in global tensions or unexpected negative developments could quickly reignite demand for safe-haven assets, potentially benefiting the JPY. It’s important to remember that the global landscape remains fraught with uncertainties, and risk sentiment can shift rapidly. Factors that could trigger renewed safe-haven demand for JPY: Escalation of Geopolitical Conflicts : Worsening of the Russia-Ukraine war or new international conflicts. Global Economic Slowdown : Signs of a significant downturn in the global economy. Financial Market Instability : Unexpected shocks or crises in global financial markets. Technical Levels to Watch in USD/JPY From a technical analysis perspective, the USD/JPY pair is at an interesting juncture. Having failed to sustain gains above the 50% retracement level and slipping below the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), the pair appears to be technically biased to the downside. However, key resistance and support levels will dictate the short-term direction. Key Technical Levels: Resistance : 152.65-152.70 (200-day SMA), 153.15 (100-day SMA), 154.45-154.50, 154.75-154.80. A break above these levels could trigger a short-covering rally. Support : 151.25, 151.00-150.90 (year-to-date low), 150.00, 149.60-149.55, 149.00, 148.65. Breaching these support levels could open the door for further declines. US Dollar Performance Against Major Currencies Today Analyzing the broader performance of the US Dollar can provide further context to the USD/JPY movement.

Understanding tariffs is crucial in today’s global economic landscape. Here’s a quick FAQ to clarify: Question Answer What are tariffs? Customs duties on imported goods, designed to protect local producers by making imports more expensive. Taxes vs. Tariffs? Tariffs are on imports, paid at entry; taxes are on domestic transactions, paid at purchase. Tariffs are by importers; taxes by individuals/businesses. Are tariffs good or bad? Debated. Proponents say they protect domestic industries. Opponents warn of higher prices and trade wars. Trump’s Tariff Plan? Focuses on reciprocal tariffs, targeting countries like Mexico, China, and Canada. Aims to boost US economy and lower income taxes using tariff revenue. Conclusion: Navigating the Yen’s Depressed State In conclusion, the Japanese Yen is currently experiencing a period of weakness, influenced by modest US Dollar strength and shifting market sentiment. However, the expectation of a BoJ rate hike provides a significant counterforce, suggesting that the downside for the JPY might indeed be limited. Factors like safe-haven demand and evolving global economic conditions will continue to play a crucial role in shaping the Yen’s trajectory. For traders and investors, keeping a close eye on BoJ policy signals, US economic data, and geopolitical developments will be paramount in navigating the complexities of the USD/JPY pair and the broader Forex market. The coming months promise to be critical for the Japanese Yen as these competing forces play out.

Korea ‘s Supreme Court has ruled that the collapsed stablecoin TerraUSD ( USTC ) and its sister token Terra ( LUNA ) are not financial investment products, rejecting a prosecution appeal and upholding earlier decisions, Korean newspaper Etoday reports . On Jan. 23, the court rejected prosecutors’ request to seize assets from Terraform Labs co-founder Shin Hyun-seong. The court agreed with lower courts that had already ruled LUNA does not qualify as a regulated financial product under Korea’s Capital Markets Act, stating that “related law and records show the lower court’s decision is valid.” Prosecutors argued that LUNA was some sort of security and tried to confiscate Shin’s assets, claiming he made illegal profits.

Prosecutors say they misled investors and manipulated the market to profit from the Terra blockchain.

Why? Because Gold’s performance often reflects broader economic anxieties that can ripple through all markets, including digital currencies. Currently, the Gold Price is demonstrating remarkable resilience, hovering above $2,900. But is this stability a calm before a storm, or a sign of Gold’s enduring strength in a turbulent world? Why is the Gold Price Showing Unwavering Strength as a Safe Haven? Despite fluctuations in other asset classes, Gold Price continues to attract buyers, marking its second consecutive day of gains. This persistent appeal can be attributed to a confluence of factors, primarily rooted in global economic uncertainties and expectations surrounding monetary policy: Escalating Trade War Concerns: US President Trump’s threats of reciprocal tariffs are igniting fears of a global trade war. In times of international trade friction, investors often flock to safe haven assets like Gold, perceived as a store of value outside the traditional financial system. Anticipation of Further Fed Rate Cuts: The market is increasingly betting on the Federal Reserve to implement further interest rate cuts later this year. Lower interest rates diminish the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like Gold, making it a more attractive investment. These elements are providing a solid foundation for Gold’s current price stability. However, it’s not all smooth sailing for the precious metal. What Factors are Capping Gold Price Gains? While Gold Price is holding firm, several headwinds are preventing it from breaking out into a significant rally. These factors introduce a degree of caution for bullish investors: Rebounding US Bond Yields: A recent uptick in US Treasury bond yields is making bonds relatively more appealing compared to Gold. As bond yields rise, they can draw investment away from non-yielding assets. Modest USD Strength: The US Dollar is showing signs of recovery after hitting multi-week lows. A stronger USD typically exerts downward pressure on Gold Price , as Gold is priced in US Dollars, becoming more expensive for holders of other currencies. Easing Geopolitical Tensions (Potentially): Optimism surrounding potential delays in US tariff implementation and talks aimed at resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict could slightly dampen the urgency for safe haven assets. However, these situations remain fluid and uncertain. Despite these capping factors, Gold bulls seem unfazed, suggesting underlying conviction in Gold’s long-term value proposition. Decoding Fed Speak: Will Fed Rate Cuts Fuel the Next Gold Price Rally? Federal Reserve policy decisions are crucial drivers for Gold Price movements. Recent statements from Fed officials offer mixed signals, adding complexity to the outlook for interest rate cuts and their impact on Gold: Data-Dependent Approach: Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker emphasized a data-driven approach, suggesting a steady policy stance for now, citing sticky inflation and a balanced labor market. Inflation Concerns: Fed Governor Michelle Bowman pointed to high asset prices potentially hindering inflation progress, indicating a need for more definitive signs of declining inflation before considering rate cuts. Conditional Rate Cut Outlook: Fed Governor Christopher Waller suggested that rate cuts would be appropriate in 2025 if inflation trends mirror the disinflationary pattern observed in 2024. Market expectations, reflected in Fed Funds Futures, currently price in a possibility of a 40 basis point rate cut in 2025. The timing and magnitude of these cuts will be pivotal in determining the future trajectory of Gold Price . Technical Outlook: Is Gold Poised for a Breakout or a Breakdown? From a technical analysis perspective, Gold Price action reveals a market in consolidation: Range-Bound Trading: Gold has been trading within a narrow range for the past week, characterized as a bullish consolidation following a recent surge to record highs. Positive Momentum Indicators: Oscillators on the daily chart remain in positive territory, suggesting the path of least resistance may still be upward. Overbought RSI and Resistance Levels: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing overbought territory, indicating potential for price pullback. Immediate resistance lies around $2,925, followed by the all-time high near $2,942-2,943. A decisive break above these levels could signal a significant breakout. Support Levels: On the downside, immediate support is seen near $2,900, followed by the $2,878-2,876 region. Further down, the $2,860-$2,855 area is anticipated as a potential buying zone. Traders are closely watching these technical levels for signals of the next major move in Gold Price . Navigating the Gold Market: Key Takeaways for Investors The current Gold Price environment presents a nuanced picture. Here’s what investors should consider: Monitor Trade War Developments: Escalating trade tensions are a significant bullish catalyst for Gold. Pay close attention to any news regarding tariffs and international trade relations. Track Fed Policy Signals: Federal Reserve statements and economic data releases will heavily influence interest rate expectations and, consequently, Gold Price . Stay informed about FOMC member speeches and key economic indicators. USD and Bond Yield Dynamics: Keep an eye on US Dollar strength and Treasury bond yields, as these factors can exert opposing pressures on Gold. Technical Levels Matter: Watch the key support and resistance levels outlined above for potential trading opportunities and to gauge market sentiment. Gold Price: A Timeless Safe Haven in a World of Uncertainty Despite short-term fluctuations and range-bound trading, Gold Price continues to demonstrate its enduring appeal as a safe haven asset. In a world grappling with geopolitical risks, trade uncertainties, and evolving monetary policies, Gold’s role as a store of value and a hedge against economic turmoil remains firmly intact. Whether it breaks higher or tests lower support levels in the near term, Gold’s fundamental importance in a diversified investment portfolio is undeniable, especially for those navigating the volatile landscape of cryptocurrency and broader financial markets.

40531858,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=130313,1739950774,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Alert: USD/INR *Surges* on Foreign Funds Outflows & Relentless US Dollar Demand – What’s Next for Indian Rupee?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/usd-inr-surge-forex-analysis/,"Buckle up, crypto enthusiasts and Forex traders! The Indian Rupee (INR) is facing a turbulent ride against the US Dollar (USD). Today’s early trading sessions are showing a significant uptick in USD/INR, leaving many wondering what’s driving this surge and what it means for the Indian economy and the broader Forex market. Let’s dive into the critical factors fueling this currency movement and explore what could happen next. Why is USD/INR on a *Surge*? Decoding the Forex Dynamics Several factors are converging to push the USD/INR exchange rate higher. Let’s break down the key drivers: Foreign Funds Outflows: Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) are pulling money out of Indian markets. This exodus creates a higher demand for US Dollars as these investors convert their INR holdings back to USD, weakening the Indian Rupee. Robust US Dollar Demand: The US Dollar is gaining strength globally. This is partly due to its safe-haven appeal amidst global economic uncertainties and anticipation of future US economic data releases. Trade Deficit Woes: India’s trade deficit widened in January, indicating that imports are exceeding exports. This necessitates more US Dollars to pay for imports, further driving up USD demand and impacting the Indian Rupee negatively. Geopolitical Tensions: The looming threat of a global trade war, sparked by potential tariff measures from the US, adds another layer of uncertainty. Such tensions typically boost the US Dollar as investors seek safer assets. Think of it like this: imagine a seesaw. On one side, you have the Indian Rupee, and on the other, the US Dollar. Right now, heavy weights like foreign funds outflows and global risk aversion are being placed on the US Dollar side, causing the INR side to lift – meaning the USD/INR rate rises. RBI Intervention: Can it *Rescue* the Indian Rupee? The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is often seen as a key player in managing Indian Rupee volatility. In situations like this, the RBI might step in to stabilize the currency. How might they do this? Direct Intervention: The RBI can directly sell US Dollars from its reserves and buy Rupees. This increases the supply of USD and demand for INR in the market, potentially curbing the Rupee’s fall. Interest Rate Adjustments: While not explicitly mentioned in the current news snippet as an immediate action, the RBI could use interest rate hikes to attract foreign investment and make holding Rupees more attractive. However, this is a broader policy tool and not always used for short-term currency management. Analysts suggest that RBI intervention could indeed limit the extent of the INR’s losses. However, the effectiveness of intervention depends on the scale and persistence of the factors driving the USD/INR upwards. It’s a balancing act for the RBI. Analyzing the Forex Technicals: USD/INR Chart Outlook Let’s peek at the technical picture for USD/INR. According to the daily chart analysis mentioned in the news: Bullish Trend Intact: The USD/INR pair remains in a bullish trend, trading above the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This suggests the upward momentum is still strong. RSI Indicator: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is above the midline, further supporting the bullish outlook. Key Resistance Levels: The immediate resistance is around 87.00. Breaking above this could push the pair towards its all-time high near 88.00 and potentially 88.50. Support Levels: On the downside, immediate support is around 86.35 (February 12 low), followed by 86.14 (January 27 low). In simple terms, technical indicators suggest that the path of least resistance for USD/INR is currently upwards. Traders are watching these levels closely for potential breakout or breakdown scenarios in the Forex market. Understanding the Broader Impact: Indian Economy and the Rupee The strength or weakness of the Indian Rupee is intricately linked to the Indian economy. Let’s address some frequently asked questions to understand this connection better: How does the Indian economy impact the Indian Rupee? A robust Indian economy generally supports a stronger Rupee. High economic growth attracts foreign investment (both FDI and FII), increasing demand for the INR. Conversely, economic slowdown or negative economic news can weaken the Rupee. Key Economic Indicators & INR Impact: Economic Factor Positive Impact on INR Negative Impact on INR Economic Growth Higher growth attracts investment, strengthens INR Slower growth reduces investment, weakens INR Foreign Investment (FDI & FII) Increased inflows boost INR demand, strengthens INR Outflows reduce INR demand, weakens INR Exports Higher exports increase INR demand, strengthens INR Lower exports reduce INR demand, weakens INR Imports Lower imports reduce USD demand, strengthens INR Higher imports increase USD demand, weakens INR What is the impact of Oil prices on the Rupee *Exchange Rate*? India is a major oil importer. Since oil is primarily traded in US Dollars, rising oil prices increase India’s USD demand. This puts downward pressure on the Currency , as more Rupees are needed to buy the same amount of USD for oil imports. Conversely, falling oil prices can ease pressure on the INR. How does inflation in India impact the Rupee? Inflation’s impact is complex. High inflation erodes the Rupee’s value over time. However, if inflation rises above the RBI’s target, the RBI may raise interest rates to combat it. Higher interest rates can attract foreign investment, potentially strengthening the Rupee. But persistently high inflation can ultimately be detrimental to the Exchange Rate . How does seasonal US Dollar demand from importers and banks impact the Rupee? India’s import-heavy trade structure means there’s consistent demand for US Dollars. Seasonal factors or large import orders can create surges in USD demand. During these periods, the Rupee tends to weaken as importers buy more USD. Similarly, during periods of market volatility, the demand for the US Dollar as a safe-haven asset can spike, also weakening the Rupee. Actionable Insights for Forex Traders For those trading USD/INR or involved in the Forex market, here are some actionable insights based on the current scenario: Monitor FII Flows: Keep an eye on foreign investment trends. Continued outflows will likely keep pressure on the INR. Track US Dollar Index: The strength of the US Dollar globally is a major factor. Follow the US Dollar Index (DXY) for broader USD movements. Watch RBI Actions: Be alert for any potential RBI interventions or policy announcements that could impact the Rupee. Analyze Technical Levels: Pay attention to the key support and resistance levels mentioned in the technical analysis for potential trading opportunities. Stay Informed on Global Events: Geopolitical developments and global economic news, especially related to trade and US economic data, can significantly influence USD/INR. Conclusion: Navigating the USD/INR Volatility The USD/INR pair is currently experiencing upward pressure due to a confluence of factors, including foreign funds outflows, strong US Dollar demand, and trade deficit concerns. While RBI intervention might offer some respite, the underlying trends suggest continued volatility. For traders and businesses dealing with Currency fluctuations, staying informed, monitoring key indicators, and understanding the dynamics of the Exchange Rate are crucial for navigating these uncertain times. The situation remains fluid, and close observation of market developments is essential.

Did the markets anticipate this move, or is there more to the story behind the Aussie’s defiance? Let’s dive into the details and explore what this means for traders and the broader economic landscape. Decoding the RBA’s Interest Rate Decision and Market Reaction On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announced its Interest Rate Decision , reducing the Official Cash Rate by 25 basis points to 4.10%. This move, while widely expected, marks the first rate cut in four years and signals a potential shift in the RBA’s monetary policy. The central bank’s decision comes amid signs of easing inflation, with recent data indicating slowing price pressures in Australia. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key economic indicators influencing the RBA’s decision: Easing Inflation: December data revealed a slowdown in price pressures, prompting speculation about the RBA’s next move. Consumer Price Index (CPI): The quarterly CPI rose less than expected in Q4 2024, indicating cooling inflation. Trimmed Mean CPI: The RBA’s preferred inflation measure rose by 0.5% for the quarter, below the 0.6% forecast, and the annualized rate fell to 3.2% from 3.5%. Despite the rate cut, which is typically seen as bearish for a currency, the Australian Dollar showed surprising strength. Why did the Aussie Dollar not plummet as expected? Several factors are at play, contributing to this unexpected market reaction. Why Did the Australian Dollar Defy Expectations? The Australian Dollar Forecast remains a subject of intense scrutiny, especially after this unexpected reaction to the RBA’s rate cut. While a rate cut usually weakens a currency, the AUD’s resilience can be attributed to a combination of domestic and international factors: Anticipated Rate Cut: The market had largely priced in the 25 basis points rate cut. As the cut was widely expected, its announcement didn’t trigger a significant negative reaction. US Dollar Weakness: Simultaneously, the US Dollar (USD) experienced weakness due to disappointing US retail sales data, fueling speculation about potential Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts later in the year. This USD weakness provided a cushion for the AUD/USD pair. Trump Tariff Delay: Former US President Donald Trump’s decision to delay the implementation of reciprocal tariffs provided additional support to the AUD/USD pair, easing concerns about trade tensions. Improved Treasury Yields & US Dollar Rebound (Counter-Narrative): It’s important to note the nuanced push and pull. While initial USD weakness helped AUD, the US Dollar Index (DXY) later edged higher as US Treasury yields improved. This highlights the complex interplay of factors influencing currency valuations. AUD/USD Analysis : Navigating the Ascending Channel Currently trading near 0.6340, the AUD/USD pair is navigating an ascending channel pattern, suggesting a bullish market sentiment. Technical indicators further reinforce this outlook: Ascending Channel: The upward trend within this channel indicates sustained buying interest in the AUD/USD pair. 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI): Remaining above 50, the RSI supports the bullish momentum, suggesting further potential gains. However, traders should be mindful of key resistance and support levels: Level Value Upper Channel Boundary (Resistance 1) 0.6390 Psychological Resistance 0.6400 9-day EMA (Support 1) 0.6316 14-day EMA (Support 2) 0.6300 Lower Channel Boundary (Strong Support) 0.6280 A break above the 0.6390-0.6400 resistance zone could signal a stronger bullish move, while a fall below the 0.6280 support could indicate a potential trend reversal. Global Economic Factors and the Forex Market News Landscape The broader Forex Market News cycle is heavily influenced by global economic factors. Recent statements from US Federal Reserve officials and economic data releases are adding layers of complexity to the currency markets. Fed Officials’ Cautious Stance: Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman and Governor Christopher Waller have both emphasized a cautious approach to interest rate cuts, citing persistent inflation concerns and the need for more data-driven decision-making. Disappointing US Retail Sales: A significant 0.9% drop in US Retail Sales in January, far exceeding expectations, initially weakened the US Dollar and fueled speculation about earlier Fed rate cuts. Powell’s Dovish Tone, but Data Dependent: Fed Chair Jerome Powell, while acknowledging a strong job market and economy, indicated no urgency to cut rates, emphasizing data dependency and the potential upward pressure from tariffs. China’s Pro-Private Sector Stance: Chinese President Xi Jinping’s meeting with private sector leaders signals renewed support for the private sector, which could positively impact global economic recovery and indirectly influence currency markets. Navigating the Interest Rate Cut and Interest Rate Forecast Understanding the implications of an Interest Rate Cut is crucial for forex traders. The RBA’s move, while initially expected to weaken the AUD, has been met with a nuanced market response. Here’s what you need to consider: Short-term Volatility: Rate cuts often lead to increased volatility in the currency markets. Traders should be prepared for potential price swings in the AUD/USD and related pairs. Long-term Economic Impact: The effectiveness of the rate cut in stimulating the Australian economy and managing inflation will be a key factor in the Australian Dollar’s long-term performance. Global Rate Divergence: The divergence in monetary policy between the RBA and other central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve, will continue to influence currency valuations. Any shift in expectations regarding Fed policy will significantly impact the AUD/USD pair. Data Dependency: Both the RBA and the Fed are emphasizing data dependency. Upcoming economic data releases from both Australia and the US will be critical in shaping future market expectations and currency movements. Australian Dollar Performance Snapshot: Below is a snapshot of the Australian Dollar’s performance against major currencies today. Notice its relative strength despite the RBA’s rate cut, especially against currencies other than the US Dollar.

Conclusion: A Resilient Aussie Dollar in a Complex Forex Landscape The Australian Dollar’s ability to trim losses despite the RBA’s rate cut highlights the complexities of the forex market. While the rate cut introduces a dovish element, factors such as US Dollar weakness, technical positioning, and global economic sentiments are currently providing counter-support.

Santiment Sees a Shift Coming appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solana (SOL) has been under pressure , recently dropping to a three-month low of around $160. Many traders are frustrated with this decline, especially since SOL was trading near $293 in January. However, according to Santiment, a well-known market intelligence platform, this negative sentiment might be setting the stage for a rebound. Are Traders Too Bearish on Solana? Santiment reports that Solana’s sentiment is currently at its lowest level since January 20, when the market last experienced a sharp pullback. This means that a large number of traders have become extremely bearish, expecting SOL to continue falling. Solana sentiment has dipped to its lowest level since the big retrace on January 20th.

Interestingly, in past market trends, extreme bearish sentiment has often been followed by a price recovery. When most traders expect further losses, the market tends to move in the opposite direction. This pattern has been seen before, where panic selling creates opportunities for smart investors to buy at lower prices before a recovery. Sol Technical Analysis Hint Bullish Sign Solana (SOL) has been stuck in a downward trend for a while, forming a clear pattern of lower highs and lower lows. However, technical indicators suggest that a recovery could be on the horizon. One of the biggest signs of a possible turnaround is the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI). While the price has been making lower lows, the RSI is forming higher lows, indicating that selling pressure may be fading. If SOL manages to break above the key resistance at $173 , it could signal the beginning of a new upward trend. The next major resistance levels to watch are $195.81 and $216.90, which align with previous price consolidation zones. For now, all eyes are on Solana’s next move.

Folkman remarked that, ""the goal of the project is being able to create progress to actually merge traditional financial institutions with decentralized finance,” in a panel at CoinDesk's Consensus Hong Kong conference. For several weeks, the Trump-endorsed WLFI faced lackluster sales, failing to reach its $30 million fundraising target. The token was restricted from trading and only available to non-U.S. investors and accredited U.S. investors. The project's fortunes changed, however, when Sun stepped in. “This guy,” Folkman said with a gesture towards Sun, “saw that regardless of the outcome, this project is a monumental move forward for the entire crypto community.” When Trump announced World Liberty Financial alongside his sons in October, they said it would be a lending platform based on Aave — a popular Ethereum-based decentralized finance protocol. The platform has yet to launch, but according to Folkman, World Liberty is now developing ""a whole range of products and applications"" — not just a single tool. Today, World Liberty Financial is known for WLFI, the governance token that it put up for sale mere days after the project was unveiled. ""When we were launching this project, it was a very heated time,"" Folkman told the panel. ""There was a lot of scrutiny on our project due to who was involved."" After Sun's 10-figure endorsement, “everything kind of snowballed from there,” said Folkman. World Liberty not only oversold its fundraising target, but it eventually set a new one. Should it meet its new goal — which it seems poised to do soon — Folkman noted that WLFI will become the fourth-largest initial coin offering (ICO) of all time. Folkman claims WLFI's success came despite ""no VC backing and no special treatment to anybody who purchased the token."" Sun, however, was elevated to an official World Liberty investor after his WLFI purchase. World Liberty also bought $10 million worth of TRX tokens — the native token of Sun's TRON blockchain — and WBTC, a Sun-linked bitcoin derivative. Earlier in Feb., Blockworks reported that World Liberty has been shopping a deal to crypto teams: If a company purchases WLFI tokens and pays an additional fee, World Liberty will add that company's tokens to its portfolio — a powerful marketing instrument for up-and-coming crypto tokens. “I’ve seen that going around,"" Folkman said of the report.

The USD/CAD pair is currently navigating choppy waters, and all eyes are glued to the upcoming Canadian Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data. Will this economic indicator trigger a significant downside move? Let’s dive into the technical analysis and market outlook to uncover potential trading opportunities. Decoding the USD/CAD Forecast: Will Inflation Data Trigger a Downside Move? As of Tuesday’s early European session, the USD/CAD pair is hovering around 1.4205, showing some resilience thanks to a slightly firmer US Dollar. However, the overall sentiment leans bearish, particularly as we approach the release of the Canadian CPI inflation figures. This data release is the key event to watch today, potentially setting the stage for the next significant price swing in the USD/CAD pair. Key Factors Influencing the USD/CAD Forecast Several factors are currently at play, shaping the USD/CAD forecast . Here’s a breakdown: Technical Indicators Point to Bearish Momentum: The 4-hour chart reveals that USD/CAD is trading below the crucial 100-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This is a significant bearish signal. Further reinforcing this negative outlook is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which sits below the midline, indicating persistent selling pressure. Canadian CPI Inflation Data in Focus: The highlight of the day is undoubtedly the Canadian CPI inflation data for January. Economists anticipate a year-over-year increase of 1.8%. Month-on-month, the forecast suggests a rise to 0.1% from December’s -0.4%. These figures are critical as they will influence the Bank of Canada’s (BoC) future monetary policy decisions. Potential Impact of Inflation Data: Higher-than-expected Canadian CPI inflation could strengthen the Canadian Dollar. Why? Because it might push the Bank of Canada to maintain or even increase interest rates to combat rising prices. Higher interest rates generally attract foreign investment, boosting demand for the local currency. Technical Levels to Watch: For traders tracking currency trading , understanding key support and resistance levels is crucial. Let’s map out the immediate zones: USD/CAD Key Technical Levels Level Type Price Significance First Downside Target (Support) 1.4151 February 14 Low Next Support Level 1.4130 Bollinger Band Lower Limit Psychological Support 1.4100 Round Number Level Immediate Resistance 1.4265 Bollinger Band Upper Limit Key Resistance (EMA) 1.4310 100-period EMA Further Resistance 1.4380 February 10 High Navigating Currency Trading: What Does This Mean for Traders? For those involved in currency trading , the current technical setup and upcoming CPI release present potential opportunities. Here’s a trader’s perspective: Bearish Scenario: If the Canadian CPI inflation data meets or exceeds expectations, we could see a push below the initial support at 1.4151. A successful break could accelerate the downside momentum, targeting 1.4130 and potentially the 1.4100 psychological level. Bullish Scenario (Less Likely): To negate the current bearish bias, USD/CAD needs to decisively break above the 1.4265 resistance. This could open the door for a move towards the 100-period EMA at 1.4310, and further gains could challenge the 1.4380 level. However, given the prevailing technical indicators, a significant bullish move seems less probable in the immediate term, unless the CPI data drastically disappoints. Focus on Risk Management: Regardless of the direction, robust risk management is paramount. Traders should employ stop-loss orders to protect capital and avoid excessive leverage, especially during volatile periods around economic data releases. Understanding Technical Analysis in Forex News Technical analysis is a cornerstone of forex trading, and in this forex news scenario, it provides valuable insights. The use of moving averages like the 100-period EMA, the RSI, and Bollinger Bands are standard tools for identifying trends and potential turning points. The fact that USD/CAD is below the 100-period EMA and the RSI is bearishly positioned underscores the current downward pressure. These tools, combined with fundamental analysis like monitoring Canadian CPI inflation , equip traders to make more informed decisions. The Broader Forex News Landscape Beyond USD/CAD and Canadian CPI inflation , the broader forex news landscape is always dynamic. Factors such as: Global Economic Health: The overall health of the global economy, particularly the US and Canada, plays a significant role in currency valuations. Central Bank Policies: Monetary policy decisions from the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve are crucial drivers. Interest rate differentials between the two countries significantly impact the USD/CAD exchange rate. Commodity Prices: As Canada is a major oil exporter, fluctuations in oil prices can influence the Canadian Dollar. Higher oil prices often support the CAD. Market Sentiment: Risk appetite in global markets also affects currency flows. In risk-on environments, commodity currencies like the CAD may benefit. Conclusion: Navigating the USD/CAD Landscape with CPI Data in Sight The USD/CAD pair is at a critical juncture. The technical picture currently favors the bears, and the upcoming Canadian CPI inflation data is poised to be the catalyst for the next directional move. Traders should closely monitor the 1.4151 support level and the 1.4265 resistance.

In a move that sent ripples through the Forex market, the RBA lowered its Official Cash Rate by 25 basis points to 4.10%. Was this a seismic shift or just a ripple? Let’s dive into why the Aussie Dollar is showing surprising resilience and what it means for traders. Decoding the RBA’s Interest Rate Cut: A Forex Market Perspective On Tuesday, February 18, 2025, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) executed its first interest rate cut in four years, bringing the Official Cash Rate down to 4.10%. This decision, while expected by many, marks a significant shift in monetary policy. Governor Michele Bullock addressed the media, acknowledging the impact of high interest rates but cautioned against prematurely celebrating victory over inflation. The central bank’s move reflects concerns about slowing price pressures, highlighted by recent data showing a dip in Australia’s Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Trimmed Mean CPI, the RBA’s preferred inflation gauge, also showed a slower quarterly increase than anticipated. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors surrounding the RBA rate cut: The Cut: A 25 basis point reduction in the Official Cash Rate, bringing it to 4.10%. Rationale: Slowing inflation and the impact of previous high interest rates on the economy. Governor Bullock’s Stance: Acknowledged the impact of rates but emphasized it’s too early to declare victory on inflation, pointing to a strong jobs market. Bank Response: Australia’s “Big Four” banks—CBA, NAB, ANZ, and Westpac—swiftly followed suit, reducing their interest rates by 25 basis points. Why Did the Australian Dollar Remain Steady? Unpacking the AUD/USD Reaction Despite the dovish signal of an interest rate cut, the Australian Dollar (AUD) demonstrated remarkable stability. The AUD/USD pair experienced only minor fluctuations, suggesting that traders had already factored in the RBA’s decision. This ‘priced in’ phenomenon is common in Forex markets, where anticipation of major events often leads to adjustments before the actual announcement. Moreover, other global factors are currently at play, influencing the AUD/USD dynamic. Consider these elements contributing to the Australian Dollar’s steadiness: Market Anticipation: The rate cut was widely expected, diminishing its immediate impact on the AUD. US Dollar Weakness: Disappointing US retail sales data fueled speculation about potential Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts, weakening the US Dollar (USD) and providing some support to the AUD/USD pair. Trump Tariff Delay: President Trump’s decision to postpone reciprocal tariffs offered additional, albeit temporary, support to the AUD. Interest Rates and Inflation: The Global Balancing Act While the RBA is easing monetary policy, the global landscape remains complex. Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman recently highlighted persistent upside inflation risks in the US, stressing the need for more clarity before considering US rate cuts. This divergence in central bank approaches creates an interesting dynamic in the Forex market. Higher US Treasury yields, particularly on 2-year and 10-year bonds, are currently bolstering the US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the USD against six major currencies. This strengthening USD presents headwinds for the Australian Dollar. Here’s a comparative look at the factors influencing interest rate decisions and inflation: Factor Australia (RBA) United States (Fed) Recent Rate Decision Cut by 25 bps to 4.10% On hold, current range 5.25%-5.50% Inflation Concerns Slowing inflation, but still above target Persistent upside risks, progress slow Economic Outlook Impact of high rates felt, strong jobs market Solid economic growth, strong job market Future Rate Path Further cuts not guaranteed, data-dependent No hurry to cut, data-dependent Navigating the AUD/USD Landscape: Technical Analysis and Key Levels From a technical analysis perspective, the AUD/USD pair is currently trading around 0.6340, exhibiting an upward trend within an ascending channel. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) above 50 reinforces a bullish bias. For traders watching the Forex news, key levels to monitor include: Resistance: 0.6390 (upper channel boundary), 0.6400 (psychological resistance). Support: 0.6316 (9-day EMA), 0.6300 (14-day EMA), 0.6280 (lower channel boundary).

Australian Dollar FAQs: Key Drivers and Influences Understanding the Australian Dollar requires considering a range of factors beyond just interest rates. Here are some frequently asked questions to provide deeper insights: What key factors drive the Australian Dollar? RBA Interest Rates: A primary driver. Higher rates generally support the AUD. Iron Ore Prices: As a major export, iron ore prices significantly impact the AUD. Chinese Economy: China’s economic health, being Australia’s largest trading partner, is crucial. Australian Economic Health: Inflation, growth rate, and trade balance are all important. Market Sentiment: Risk appetite influences the AUD, with risk-on sentiment generally positive for the AUD. How do the decisions of the Reserve Bank of Australia impact the Australian Dollar? The RBA’s monetary policy decisions, primarily interest rate adjustments, are pivotal. Higher interest rates make the AUD more attractive to foreign investors seeking yield, increasing demand and value. Conversely, lower rates can weaken the AUD. Quantitative easing and tightening measures by the RBA also influence the currency. How does the health of the Chinese Economy impact the Australian Dollar? China’s robust economic growth translates to increased demand for Australian exports, particularly raw materials. This heightened demand boosts the AUD. Economic slowdowns in China have the opposite effect, reducing demand for the AUD and potentially weakening it. Chinese economic data releases often directly impact the AUD. How does the price of Iron Ore impact the Australian Dollar? Iron ore is Australia’s top export. Rising iron ore prices increase Australia’s export earnings, improving the trade balance and bolstering demand for the AUD. Falling iron ore prices have the reverse effect, potentially weakening the AUD. How does the Trade Balance impact the Australian Dollar? A positive trade balance, where exports exceed imports, indicates strong demand for a country’s goods and services. This surplus demand naturally strengthens the country’s currency, in this case, the Australian Dollar. A negative trade balance can weaken the AUD. Conclusion: Navigating Forex Markets in a Dynamic Environment The Australian Dollar’s steady reaction to the RBA rate cut underscores the complex interplay of factors influencing Forex markets. While the rate cut itself is a significant event, global economic conditions, US Dollar dynamics, and commodity prices all contribute to the AUD’s valuation.

These figures can significantly influence traditional markets, indirectly impacting crypto sentiment and investment flows. Today, we’re diving into the latest UK employment data and its surprising steadiness, exploring what it means for the British Pound (GBP) and the GBP/USD pair, a key indicator in the Forex market. UK Unemployment Rate Stays Put: A Sigh of Relief? The latest report from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) brings a mixed bag of news from the UK labor market. The headline figure, the UK Unemployment Rate , remained unchanged at 4.4% for the quarter ending in December. This is slightly better than the anticipated 4.5%, offering a hint of resilience in the UK economy despite broader global uncertainties. But is it all good news? Let’s break down the key components of this ONS release. Key Takeaways from the UK Employment Data: Unemployment Rate: Held steady at 4.4%, against an expected rise to 4.5%. This suggests a stable labor market, at least for now. Claimant Count Change: Increased by 22,000 in January, a significant jump from December’s revised decrease of 15,100. This figure missed expectations of a 10,000 increase, indicating a potential softening in the labor market despite the stable unemployment rate. Employment Change: A positive surprise, with employment increasing by 107,000 in December, significantly higher than November’s 35,000. This positive employment change somewhat offsets the negative claimant count data. Average Earnings Growth: Wage growth remains robust. Average Earnings, excluding bonuses, grew by 5.9% in the three months to December, matching expectations and the previous reading. Including bonuses, average earnings also rose by 5.9%, exceeding the 5.6% prior and market consensus of 5.9%. This persistent wage growth could fuel inflationary pressures, which is a key concern for central banks. Decoding the Mixed Signals: What Does it Mean for GBP/USD? The immediate market reaction to this mixed UK Employment Data was evident in the GBP/USD exchange rate. Initially, the Pound trimmed its losses, briefly regaining the 1.2600 level. This suggests that the steady unemployment rate provided some support to the GBP. However, the rise in the claimant count and persistent wage inflation present a more complex picture. GBP/USD is often seen as a barometer of market sentiment towards the UK economy. The initial positive reaction indicates that markets are focusing on the stable unemployment rate and strong employment change figures. However, the underlying concerns about rising claimant counts and wage-driven inflation are likely to keep gains in GBP/USD limited. Traders are now likely assessing whether this data will influence the Bank of England’s (BoE) future monetary policy decisions. Average Earnings Growth: A Double-Edged Sword? The continued strong growth in Average Earnings Growth is a critical aspect of this report. While rising wages are generally positive for workers, they also pose a challenge for the Bank of England in its fight against inflation. Here’s why: Inflationary Pressure: Robust wage growth can contribute to a wage-price spiral, where higher wages lead to increased consumer spending and further inflationary pressures. BoE’s Dilemma: The Bank of England is already grappling with high inflation. Strong wage growth might prompt them to maintain a hawkish stance, potentially leading to further interest rate hikes. Impact on Businesses: While good for employees, sustained high wage growth can increase labor costs for businesses, potentially impacting profitability and investment. The table below summarizes the key UK employment data points and their market expectations: Indicator Period Actual Expected Previous Unemployment Rate 3 months to December 4.4% 4.5% 4.4% Claimant Count Change January 22K 10K -15.1K (Revised) Employment Change December 107K N/A 35K Average Earnings excl. Bonus (3M YoY) December 5.9% 5.9% 5.6% Average Earnings incl. Bonus (3M YoY) December 5.9% 5.9% 5.6% Claimant Count Change: A Warning Sign or a Blip? The significant increase in the Claimant Count Change is perhaps the most concerning aspect of this report. A jump to 22,000 from a revised -15,100 in the previous month, and exceeding expectations, could signal a potential weakening in the labor market’s underlying strength. However, it’s crucial to consider monthly data with caution as they can be volatile. It remains to be seen whether this is a one-off increase or the start of a trend. Investors and economists will be closely watching future releases to determine if the UK labor market is indeed starting to cool down more noticeably. Navigating Forex Markets with Economic Insights For those involved in cryptocurrency trading and investment, understanding how traditional financial markets react to economic data is invaluable. Forex markets, particularly pairs like GBP/USD , can offer insights into broader market sentiment and risk appetite. When analyzing crypto assets, it’s important to consider these macroeconomic undercurrents. The reaction of GBP/USD to the UK employment data highlights the interconnectedness of global markets. While the crypto market operates 24/7 and is influenced by its own unique factors, it’s not entirely isolated from traditional economic forces. Monitoring key economic releases and their impact on Forex can provide a more holistic view of market dynamics. Conclusion: A Stable Surface with Underlying Currents In conclusion, the latest UK employment report presents a picture of stability on the surface, with the UK Unemployment Rate remaining steady. However, beneath the surface, there are currents of concern, particularly with the rise in the claimant count and persistent wage inflation. For GBP/USD, this translates to a mixed outlook – potential for short-term support from the stable unemployment rate, but lingering headwinds from inflationary pressures and a potentially softening labor market. As always, data dependency will be key for the Bank of England and market participants alike.

Coinbase shareholder Wenduo Guo filed the complaint in a New Jersey federal court on Feb. 18. In the complaint, Guo said that Coinbase and its leadership failed to disclose that in the event of a bankruptcy, Coinbase customer assets could be considered part of the exchange’s bankruptcy estate. This would consequently make retail investors that use the platform unsecured creditors in a bankruptcy scenario. Coinbase accused of using company funds to perform risk trades Prior to Coinbase’s public listing in April of 2021, around 75 crypto exchanges collapsed, according to the Feb. 18 complaint. This, according to Guo, left the platforms’ customers unable to recover their crypto losses. The shareholder then alleged that customer funds on Coinbase are exposed to the same level of risk as the funds that were trapped in the collapsed exchanges should Coinbase file for bankruptcy. “Despite repeated statements by Company management to the contrary, Coinbase was no different with respect to the risk of digital asset loss in the event of bankruptcy.” In the complaint filed yesterday, Guo also claimed that the crypto exchange platform failed to tell investors that it engaged in proprietary trading in order to compensate for falling crypto prices during the 2021 bear market. Coinbase still in legal trouble with the SEC for listing unregistered securities Guo’s lawsuit that was filed yesterday is not the only legal hot water Coinbase finds itself in. The concerned shareholder also noted a June 2023 lawsuit filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the SEC case, Coinbase was accused of listing unregistered securities. This lawsuit was filed during the same time around when the SEC started going after crypto exchanges for facilitating the trade of what the regulator considered unregistered securities. While there has not been a definitive change in the SEC’s stance as to whether cryptos are securities or not, many companies operating in the space in the US find themselves embroiled in legal cases with the SEC. In addition to the alleged listing of securities that were not registered with the SEC, the agency’s lawsuit also claims that Coinbase executives, including the company’s well-known CEO Brian Armstrong, sold millions of stock. This led to hundreds of millions in personal profits for Coinbase executives, according to the SEC. Some of the executives named in Guo’s lawsuit include co-founder Fred Ehrsam, CFO Alesia Haas, COO Emilia Choi, CLO Paul Grewal and head of accounting Jennifer Jones, along with several board members.

40532300,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=130361,1739951610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unsettled Yen Bears: Surprising Standstill Amid Rising BoJ Rate Hike Bets,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/yen-bears-boj-rate-hikes/,"Is the Japanese Yen about to defy expectations? Despite growing anticipation of further interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan (BoJ), the bearish sentiment surrounding the Yen appears surprisingly restrained. Let’s dive into why Yen bears are seemingly hesitant and what this means for the USD/JPY pair and the broader Forex market. Why Aren’t Yen Bears Pouncing Despite BoJ Rate Hike Buzz? The Japanese Yen (JPY) recently pulled back after hitting a one-week high against the US Dollar, a move that might seem counterintuitive given the increasing chatter about the BoJ tightening its monetary policy. Several factors are at play, creating a complex scenario where outright Yen bearishness is tempered: BoJ Rate Hike Expectations: Markets are increasingly pricing in additional interest rate hikes from the Bank of Japan this year. This expectation alone should, in theory, strengthen the Yen. Narrowing US-Japan Yield Differential: The gap between US and Japanese bond yields is shrinking. This is largely due to bets on the Federal Reserve (Fed) cutting interest rates, making the lower-yielding Yen relatively more attractive. Essentially, while the fundamental backdrop of potential BoJ rate hikes should be supportive of the Yen, other global factors and expectations are creating a tug-of-war, preventing a full-blown bearish assault on the JPY. Global Uncertainty: Safe Haven Demand Dwindles Traditionally, the Japanese Yen benefits from its safe-haven status during times of global uncertainty. However, recent developments are diminishing this appeal: Trump Tariff Talk Delay: Optimism surrounding a possible delay in the implementation of US President Trump’s reciprocal tariffs is easing trade war fears. Russia-Ukraine War Talks: Hopes for peace talks between the US and Russia regarding the Ukraine conflict are also boosting market sentiment. These positive developments reduce the demand for safe-haven assets like the Yen, putting downward pressure on its value. Investors are seemingly less fearful, and this “risk-on” sentiment is not typically favorable for the JPY. USD Strength Adds Another Layer to the USD/JPY Equation The US Dollar (USD) is showing signs of life, further complicating the USD/JPY outlook: Rising US Treasury Yields: A recent uptick in US Treasury bond yields is supporting the Dollar. Snapping Losing Streak: The USD is attempting to recover from a three-day losing streak, adding to the upward pressure on the USD/JPY pair. This renewed USD strength is partially offsetting any potential Yen gains from rate hikes expectations, contributing to the non-committal stance of Yen bears. Decoding the Data: Japan’s Economy and Fed’s Dilemma Economic data from both Japan and the US is playing a crucial role in shaping the Japanese Yen and USD dynamics: Japan’s Strong Economic Signals: Strong Inflation: Robust inflation figures out of Japan are reinforcing the case for BoJ action. Solid GDP Growth: Strong Q4 GDP data further solidifies the argument for imminent rate hikes by the BoJ. Market Pricing: Markets are now anticipating approximately 37 basis points of additional rate increases by December, pushing Japanese government bond yields to levels not seen since 2010. US Economic Mixed Signals: Retail Sales Dip: A surprise drop in US Retail Sales introduces uncertainty about the strength of the US economy. Mixed Inflation Signals: Conflicting inflation indicators are making the Fed’s policy path less clear. Potential Fed Rate Cuts: Despite some Fed officials advocating for steady policy, market expectations for Fed rate cuts later in the year (September or October) persist. This divergence in economic signals and central bank stances creates a push-and-pull effect on the USD/JPY, contributing to the current state of flux. Fed Speak: Navigating Conflicting Signals Recent comments from Federal Reserve officials highlight the uncertainty surrounding future monetary policy: Harker’s Steady Policy Stance: Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker suggests a steady policy approach given the balanced labor market and sticky inflation. Bowman’s Asset Price Concerns: Fed Governor Michelle Bowman points to high asset prices potentially hindering inflation progress, emphasizing the need for more certainty before rate cuts. Waller’s Data-Dependent Approach: Fed Governor Christopher Waller indicates that rate cuts in 2025 would be appropriate if inflation trends mirror 2024. Despite these cautious tones, Fed Funds Futures still indicate expectations for rate cuts in 2025, which continues to pressure US Treasury yields and narrow the US-Japan yield differential. Technical View: USD/JPY Bears Hold Some Cards From a technical analysis perspective, the USD/JPY chart suggests a potential bearish bias, at least in the short term: Failed Retracement: Last week’s failure to break above the 50% retracement level and subsequent drop below the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) favor bearish traders. Negative Oscillators: Oscillators on the daily chart remain in negative territory, indicating further downside potential. Key Resistance Levels: The 152.00 and 152.65 (200-day SMA) levels are likely to act as strong resistance, potentially capping any upward movements. Support Levels to Watch: Immediate support lies around 151.25, followed by the 151.00-150.90 zone (year-to-date low). A break below this could open the door to further declines towards 150.00 and lower levels. Traders are closely watching the 152.65 area (200-day SMA). Staying below this level could reinforce the bearish outlook, while a break above might signal a potential shift in momentum. Understanding the Fed and Tariffs: Key FAQs To better understand the forces influencing the Japanese Yen and USD, let’s address some frequently asked questions about the Federal Reserve and tariffs: Fed FAQs: Question Answer What does the Federal Reserve do? The Fed manages US monetary policy, aiming for price stability and full employment, primarily by adjusting interest rates. How do Fed actions impact the US Dollar? Raising rates typically strengthens the USD, while lowering rates weakens it. How often does the Fed meet? The Fed holds eight policy meetings per year. What is Quantitative Easing (QE)? QE is a policy where the Fed injects liquidity by buying bonds, usually weakening the USD. What is Quantitative Tightening (QT)? QT is the reverse of QE, where the Fed reduces its balance sheet, typically strengthening the USD. Tariffs FAQs: Question Answer What are tariffs? Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, designed to protect domestic industries. Tariffs vs. Taxes? Tariffs are on imports, prepaid at entry; taxes are broader, paid at purchase. Are tariffs good or bad? Economists debate their impact; they can protect industries but also raise prices and trigger trade wars. Trump’s tariff plan? Trump aims to use tariffs to support US producers, focusing on countries like Mexico, China, and Canada, and potentially use revenue to cut income taxes. Conclusion: A Wait-and-See Approach for Yen Bears In conclusion, while the fundamental drivers for a stronger Japanese Yen – namely, anticipated BoJ rate hikes – are in place, a confluence of global factors and mixed signals from the US economy are keeping Yen bears at bay. The USD/JPY pair remains in a delicate balance, influenced by shifting risk sentiment, USD strength, and the diverging paths of the BoJ and the Fed. For now, the market seems to be adopting a cautious, wait-and-see approach, as traders assess incoming economic data and central bank communications to gauge the next decisive move in the Japanese Yen .

With the S&P 500 hitting new highs and the so-called “Trump Trade” reversing course, Timmer offers nuanced insights into fiscal policy, inflation, and the role of risk assets in a “limbo” market environment. The Trump Effect Timmer observes that the first six weeks of 2025 have brought unexpected market moves and an unusually high “noise-to-signal ratio.” The dominant market expectation coming into the year—anticipating “higher yields, a stronger dollar, and outperforming US equities”—has abruptly flipped. He notes: “It seems so 2025 that the consensus trade of higher yields, a stronger dollar, and outperforming US equities has turned into the opposite.” Timmer highlights that Bitcoin, fresh off a year-end rally, remains on top of rolling three-month return rankings, followed closely by gold, Chinese equities, commodities, and European markets. At the lower end of the table, the US dollar and Treasuries are bringing up the rear. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $500,000: Standard Chartered Doubles Down On 2028 Target Despite the S&P 500’s record levels, Timmer calls this a “digestion period” following the post-election optimism. He explains that the market beneath the headline index is much less decisive. According to Timmer, the equal-weighted index remains on hold, with only 55% of stocks trading above their 50-day moving averages. “Sentiment is bullish, credit spreads are narrow, the equity risk premium (ERP) is in the 10th decile, and the VIX is at 15. The market appears to be priced for success.” Timmer underscores that while earnings growth was robust at 11% in 2024, revisions appear lackluster, and there are open questions about what might happen if long-term rates climb towards 5% or beyond. One of the most critical pieces of Timmer’s analysis centers on Federal Reserve policy. He points to the recent CPI report, with a year-over-year core inflation figure of 3.5%, as a near-consensus indicator that the Fed will remain on pause. “It’s now all but unanimous that the Fed is on hold for some time to come. That’s exactly right, in my view. If neutral is 4%, I believe the Fed should be a smidge above that level, given the potential likelihood that ‘3 is the new 2.’” He warns about the possibility of a “premature pivot,” recalling the policy mistakes from the 1966–1968 period, when rate cuts happened too early, ultimately allowing inflation to gain a foothold. With the Fed apparently sidelined, Timmer believes the next market driver for interest rates will come from the long end of the curve. Specifically, he sees tension between two scenarios: one featuring endless deficit spending and rising term premiums—hitting equity valuations—and another emphasizing fiscal discipline, which would presumably rein in long-dated bond yields. Timmer also remarks that weekly jobless claims may come into sharper focus for bond markets, given how government spending under the new administration could influence employment data. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Final Dip Before $273,000? A Market Veteran Thinks So Timmer points out a potential bullish pattern—a head-and-shoulders bottom—in the Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index. Though he stops short of calling it a definitive shift, he notes that commodities remain in a broader secular uptrend and could see renewed investor interest if inflation pressures stay elevated or fiscal conditions remain loose. Gold, he notes, has been “a big winner” in recent years, outperforming many skeptics’ expectations: “Since 2020, gold has produced almost the same return as the S&P 500 while having a lower volatility. In my view, gold remains an essential component of a diversified portfolio in a regime in which bonds might remain impaired.” Timmer sees gold testing the critical $3,000 level amid a global uptick in money supply and a decline in real yields. Historically, gold has shown a strong negative correlation with real yields, though Timmer believes the metal’s strength of late may also reflect fiscal rather than monetary dynamics—particularly, geopolitical demand from central banks in China and Russia. Bitcoin Vs. Gold According to Timmer, the outperformance of both gold and Bitcoin has “sparked a lot of conversation about monetary inflation.” However, he draws a distinction between the “quantity of money” (the money supply) and the “price of money” (price inflation). “The point of this exercise is to show that the growth in traditional asset prices over time can’t just be explained away by monetary debasement (which is a favorite pastime of some bitcoiners),” he writes. Timmer’s charts suggest that while nominal M2 and nominal GDP have moved in near lockstep for over a century, consumer price inflation (CPI) has lagged somewhat behind money supply growth. He cautions that adjusting asset prices solely against M2 may produce misleading conclusions. Still, his analysis finds that both Bitcoin and gold have strong correlations to M2, albeit in different ways: “It’s interesting that there’s a linear correlation between M2 and gold, but a power curve between M2 and Bitcoin. Different players on the same team.” Timmer highlights gold’s long-run performance since 1970, noting that it has effectively kept pace—or even exceeded—the value created by many bond portfolios. He sees gold’s role as a “hedge against bonds,” especially if sovereign debt markets remain pressured by fiscal deficits and higher long-term rates. Timmer’s note underscores that Bitcoin’s strong performance cannot be seen in isolation from gold or the broader macroeconomic environment. With yields in flux and policymakers grappling with deficits, investors may be forced to reassess the traditional 60/40 portfolio model. He emphasizes that while past expansions of the money supply have often spurred inflation, the relationship is not always one-to-one. Bitcoin’s meteoric rise could, in Timmer’s view, reflect a market perception that fiscal concerns—not just monetary policy—are driving asset prices. “And as you can see from the dotted orange line and the green line, Bitcoin has added the same amount of value that overnight money took over 300 years to create,” he concluded. At press time, BTC traded at $95,700.

While Shiba Inu is declining and Ethereum is preparing for a short-term increase, IntelMarkets is attracting the attention of experienced traders with its unique AI-based trading platform. IntelMarkets provides traders with advanced automation, real-time data analysis, and fast transactions. It is currently in the crypto ICO phase and has raised $9.5 million in funding. With a low market cap and the growing interest in AI technology, INTL’s price could rise by 10x soon. Analyst Bullish On Shiba Inu (SHIB) As Price Rises The Shiba Inu coin has been on a massive price correction since December 5. So far, the correction has pushed the SHIB price below the $0.000017 level. While the memecoin showed some sign of recovery recently, the bearish pressure surrounding it is still high. Technical indicators show the SHIB price in bearish territory. The Average Directional Index (14) is in the selling territory, signaling that bears are in control. So, we might see more SHIB price drops in the coming days. In addition, the Shiba Inu burn rate has declined tremendously. Data from Shibburn shows the number of burned tokens has dipped by 3% in the past seven days. However, positive momentum is brewing on the SHIB price chart. Presently, CoinMarketCap data shows the SHIB price has increased by 3.6% in the weekly timeframe. GhostMMXM says the SHIB price might pump to $0.000034 soon. Another expert called Crypto SHIB forecasts the SHIB price is ready for a breakout to $0.0000360. Ethereum (ETH) Short-term Pump Is Coming, Says Analyst Ted, a crypto enthusiast and investor has posted an optimistic ETH price forecast. He believes the altcoin might see a short-term price surge this week. Ted noted that people are tired of memes and would soon start going for utility coins. The investor forecasts the ETH price to climb to $3.1-$3.3K. In a former tweet, Ted had posted a long-term ETH price prediction. He highlighted that there was a double-bottom pattern formation on the ETH price chart. Ted says a breakout could push the ETH price to a target of $7k. Right now, the ETH price has risen by 3.0% in the weekly timeframe. CoinMarketCap data shows the ETH price has been consolidating between $2,588.09 and $2,776.09. In other news, whales have not slowed down with their Ethereum coin accumulation. A recent tweet from Ashcryptoreal revealed that Fidelity bought $4,300 ETH recently. With the ongoing accumulation, the ETH price is expected to gain momentum in the coming weeks. IntelMarkets (INTL) Uses AI To Make Crypto Trading Easier IntelMarkets (INTL ) is a project that will revolutionize the trading of cryptocurrency through the use of AI and blockchain.

Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 148,300 followers on the social media platform X that he’s keeping an eye on Bitcoin’s moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator on the weekly chart. Traders use the MACD to identify an asset’s trend and spot potential entry and exit points. According to the trader, Bitcoin’s MACD looks poised for a reset after a bearish cross, suggesting that BTC is close to witnessing a correction and plunging below $90,000. “BTC weekly MACD re-set to the zero-line underway. Technical consolidation and the likelihood of a push to new highs later in the year.” Source: Dave the Wave/X As for his downside target for Bitcoin, Dave the Wave looks at BTC’s daily chart and says that the crypto asset appears to be following in the footsteps of its 2024 price action when the flagship digital asset soared to a high of $74,000 before retracing below $50,000. “The BTC rollercoaster.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that Bitcoin will fall to the 0.382 Fibonacci level at $80,000 before kicking off the final leg of its bull market. The Fibonacci extension tool allows traders to spot potential entry and exit levels based on the Fibonacci ratio. While Dave the Wave is short to mid-term bearish on Bitcoin, he remains a long-term BTC bull. Earlier this month, the trader predicted that the correction would be swiftly followed by a parabolic rally toward the $260,000 price level before 2025 expires. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $95,503.

He has expressed hope that they are weighing the possibility of resuming US operations once again. What Are the Chances of Binance US Comeback? In his latest interview with Bloomberg, Richard Teng, CEO of Binance Holdings Ltd. stated that the United States has finally transitioned away from a restrictive crypto regulatory environment earlier, to now with a more crypto-friendly approach under President Donald Trump. Teng added that the previous Joe Biden administration was characterized by what industry executives described as “regulation by enforcement.” This approach included a wave of high-profile lawsuits and significant fines targeting companies such as Binance, Coinbase Inc., and Ripple LLC. However, since Donald Trump has taken charge at the White House office, his team has taken an inclusive approach, signaling a potential shift in the crypto regulatory framework. “I think we have a fresh reset and a restart,” Teng said . However, for Binance US to resume operations, they would be waiting for more regulatory clarity moving ahead. Binance US ceased its operations following a June 2023 lawsuit from the US SEC. The lawsuit alleged the exchange and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao ‘CZ’ mishandled customer funds, misled investors and regulators, and violated securities laws. However, the crypto exchange reached a landmark settlement with US authorities, agreeing to pay $4.3 billion to resolve the sweeping allegations. Although Binance Global continues its legal battle with the SEC, the ongoing Binance lawsuit is on pause for 60 days amid the formation of the crypto task force by the securities regulator. Reshaping Under the Donald Trump Administration Following the Binance US settlement, the crypto exchange has been working on restructuring initiatives with Richard Teng in charge. Teng along with other board directors will be working to figure out the company’s global headquarters. Speaking at the Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Centre, Teng confirmed that Binance is weighing “a couple of different locations” for its headquarters and anticipates finalizing a decision “very soon.” However, Teng also voiced concerns over local regulatory constraints in certain jurisdictions, particularly regarding limits on the number of tradable tokens and restrictions on futures trading. Recently, Binance co-founder Yi He also shrugged off reports of a Binance selloff .

Cutoshi’s presale, on the other hand, seems to be catching the attention of many investors seeking more substantial utilities in deflationary meme coins as it attempts to come up with a model that provides a promised 100x return on investment. As traditional meme coins begin losing traction, Cutoshi decides to step into the spotlight. PEPE: Moves Whales Make, And Volatility That Follows PEPE remains one of the most popular meme coins, however, it has become a subject of concern given recent events . As reported by Crypto.News , the coin is now trading at a dismal price of $0.000996, which is approximately $6 billion dollars lower than its peak value back in December. The large holders, also known as whales, have suggested a strategic buying approach for this coin as they seem to be accumulating it despite its current price. The general market also reflects a lack of demand in short-term trading with the open interest for futures trading collapsing from over half a million dollars to about two hundred fifty thousand. PEPE holders have increased from 384,000 to 404,100, suggesting long-term supporters are holding firm despite various challenges. The daily chart is giving mixed signals: a cross between 50 and 200-day moving averages shows bearish momentum, and on the other hand, a falling wedge indicates a bullish reversal might be coming. Some analysts believe that if the wedge breaks out, we will see a surge towards $0.000025, which would be a 150% gain from where we currently are. These conflicting signals have kept many investors skeptical about the near future of PEPE. Cutoshi: The Revolutionary MemeFi Investment Cutoshi (CUTO) takes a different approach when it comes to a meme coin by combining massive DeFi capabilities and memes. As opposed to other coins that serve no purpose, Cutoshi is designed to create value for its users, which will help in the long-term expansion of the ecosystem. Important Features of Cutoshi are: Multi-chain Decentralized Exchange (DEX): Eliminates the need for intermediary services, making the process secure, fast, and inexpensive with just a 0.25% transaction fee. Yield Farming & Staking Programs: Make it possible for investors to earn extra income and build their wealth from mundane day trading activities. Cutoshi Academy: Teaches practical knowledge and helps users navigate the world of digital finance by simplifying complex DeFi concepts. Cronus Token’s Deflationary Model: 7% of the total Cutoshi tokens gets burned, which irremediably creates scarcity and can, in turn, be appreciated further down the line. Cutoshi is currently in Stage 5 of its presale, gaining a whopping $1.8 million so far; what started out at $0.015 is now $0.045. Unlike meme tokens that depend on a hype train, Cutoshi has implemented a well-rounded approach with educational materials, innovative token trading tools, and even deflationary tokenomics. In addition to these features, many investors are left thinking that Cutoshi will be the next great opportunity in the MemeFi sector, hinting towards a potential 100x breakthrough. Early investors are standing to benefit from a limited-time 35% Cutoshi bonus, which is turning many heads right now. Conclusion Cutoshi is unlike PEPE in that its whale accumulations support the idea of meme coins being volatile. What sets Cutoshi apart is DeFi’s well-rounded ecosystem and novel model. Its strong presale performance combined with its unique utilities makes Cutoshi an incredible idea to invest in at the moment.

CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju’s latest analysis of Bitcoin’s cost basis across investor cohorts has ignited debates about potential bearish signals or long-term resilience. Bitcoin Price & Key Cost Basis Breakdown: Why $95K is Critical For Many Investors Ki Young Ju’s February 19 tweet highlighted critical acquisition averages: ETFs/Custody Wallets: $89,000 (institutional entry point) Binance Traders: $59,000 (retail-heavy cohort) Mining Companies: $57,000 (historically a bear market trigger if breached) Old Whales: $25,000 (untested long-term support) This reveals institutional investors are closest to break-even, while mining firms face heightened pressure. A drop below $57K could signal a bear market, as seen in 2018 and 2020. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, a vocal Bitcoin advocate, doubled down on corporate adoption this week, stating, “Bitcoin’s scarcity and institutional demand will redefine global treasury strategies.” Michael Saylor’s $2B BTC Purchase Plan Adding to the bullish narrative is MicroStrategy’s CEO and long-time Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor’s announcement that reveals a plan to raise $2 billion to buy more BTC. Strategy Announces Proposed Private Offering of $2.0B of Convertible Senior Notes. $MSTR https://t.co/EBOMdLlgdq — Michael Saylor (@saylor) February 18, 2025 Saylor’s Bitcoin acquisition spree is a barometer to gauge corporate confidence in BTC & cryptocurrencies. His recent announcement reinforced the narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a cornerstone of modern financial strategy, and it further adds credence to a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve implementation. Key BTC Price Levels To Watch With Bitcoin price crashing below $95K and catalyzing a liquidation of $340M in 24 hours, the market seems to be flushed. Let’s look at key levels to watch from a short-term and long-term scenario. $BTC Long-term – Based on Mars-Vesta Cycle thesis, this cycle top could occur on Oct 6, 2025. (Mars Vesta Cycle Thesis cc: @Yodaskk ) Worst-case/MaxPain scenario – A repeat of 2021 Cycle could see $75K-$70K bottom formation (MaxPain scenario) – Cycle peak around $120K-$150K… pic.twitter.com/PDUiZNl2fz — MAXPAIN (@Mangyek0) February 18, 2025 Short-Term Scenarios: Deviation Below VAL of $93.3K: Below the Value Area Low (VAL) of $93.3K suggests a sustained downtrend and a potential revisit of the established support level at $88.7K Long Squeeze Target: As noted in a previous CoinGape article, a sweep of $86K could catalyze a long squeeze and a point of interest for short-term traders looking to play a mean reversion trade to $100K New All-Time High (ATH): The $120K Bitcoin price target is a conservative estimate for a new ATH in the short term. The $150K-$200K target is the optimistic scenario where market sentiment drives Bitcoin prices to higher levels. Long-Term Scenarios: Cycle Top Based on Mars-Vesta Cycle: Watch Date: October 6, 2025. According to Bitcoin’s Mars-Vesta Cycle thesis , this could be the date when Bitcoin might reach its cycle top. Worst-case/MaxPain Scenario: Bottom Formation: $75K-$70K. If Bitcoin were to follow a pattern similar to the 2021 cycle, this range is suggested as a potential bottom, representing a significant correction. Cycle Peak: $120K-$150K. This range is anticipated as the peak of the cycle in a worst-case scenario, suggesting a recovery after the bottom formation but not reaching the optimistic short-term targets. Investors need to note that some of these levels coincide with the cost basis levels mentioned by the CEO of CryptoQuant, making them a key level to watch as Bitcoin price volatility increases. The Bottom Line: Balancing Risk and Opportunity While Bitcoin’s $95K cost basis tests investor resolve, long-term fundamentals remain strong. As Ki Young Ju notes, “Old whales at $25K show unshakable confidence,” while Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy continues accumulating BTC despite volatility. For traders, the $57K–$95K range is critical; for hodlers, the 2025 halving cycle and institutional tailwinds suggest upward momentum.

With a $1.8 billion SOL unlock on the horizon, investors are looking for alternative assets that could deliver massive gains. Several competing coins are attracting attention, with a potential 40X surge. Solana Rivals That Could See Massive Surge Ahead of Token Unlock Solana price and other crypto markets have been struggling to recover. This comes as the crypto market sees strong market corrections, with BTC prices hovering below $96k. Let’s Explore these best 4 Solana Rivals that could rally by 40X ahead of $1.8B SOL Unlock. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE), a major meme coin has recently experienced a notable price surge over time. Despite the current market volatility, The meme coin is still up by 190% over the past year. The DOGE price hovered at $0.253, with a slight market decrease. With the ETF speculations, whale transactions, and meme coin frenzy, this could position the DOGE price as a top Solana rival that could 40x by if the crypto market recovers. Analysts tweeted that Dogecoin price may be poised for another rally as past price cycles indicate a repeating pattern. The crypto experts shared a historical chart highlighting the DOGE previous surges, suggesting its price follows a cycle. Cardano (ADA) Cardano price climbed 21% over the past year, though it recently slipped 1% to $0.76. The blockchain’s energy-efficient PoS protocol keeps it competitive against Solana in the evolving crypto landscape. A breakout above $0.8 could push the ADA price toward the $1 mark, where another key resistance level stands. Further bullish momentum may see the price test the $1.150 and $1.200 levels if buyers gain control. On the downside, the $0.700 level serves as immediate support. A breakdown below this zone might expose ADA to a deeper decline, possibly toward $0.650. The MACD indicator shows a weak bearish crossover, with the MACD line below the signal line. Solana Rivals Sui (SUI) Sui (SUI), a layer-1 blockchain platform, has witnessed a 70% price surge over the past year, positioning itself as a Solana rival. Currently, Sui is trading at $3.13, reflecting a minor market recovery. The blockchain is designed for security, scalability, and broad adoption. Its recent performance has drawn attention, with market observers highlighting a potential price shift. An analyst noted that the TD Sequential indicator on the four-hour chart suggests a buy signal. This signal often indicates a possible price rebound. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink (LINK) price has strengthened its role as a blockchain abstraction layer, enabling seamless smart contract integration.

His data-driven analysis highlights the potential supply shock, capital inflows, and historical trends showing that approval of an XRP ETF could significantly alter the cryptocurrency’s value and liquidity. How the $XRP ETF Can Drive $XRP Price Higher A Data-Driven Analysis 1⃣-Total Potential $XRP Demand from ETFs 11 companies have filed for an $XRP ETF. Estimated 1 billion $XRP per ETF, totaling 11 billion $XRP . This represents 20% of the total circulating supply (55B… pic.twitter.com/ClZHsZ8xHd — gen A (@genAbilsav) February 18, 2025 XRP ETF Demand and Market Absorption Gen A reports that 11 companies have filed for an XRP ETF , each expected to acquire around 1 billion XRP, totaling 11 billion—about 20% of the circulating supply. This could trigger a supply shock, driving prices higher. If only 20% of the ETF demand is filled, $11 billion in inflows could push XRP to $3.5–$5. With 50% of demand met, $27.5 billion could drive prices to $6.5–$10. If demand is fully met, a supply deficit could emerge, as $55 billion attempts to buy 20 billion XRP when only 11 billion are available, potentially sending prices to $15–$25 or higher. Supply Shock and Market Response If 11 billion XRP were locked within ETFs, the circulating supply would drop to 44 billion. Given that demand for XRP is expected to remain stable or increase, basic economic principles suggest that prices rise to accommodate the imbalance. The resulting supply shock could drive out many retail investors, while driving up prices, mirroring previous ETF-induced market shifts. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional Investment and Capital Inflows The anticipated inflow of $55 billion across all XRP ETFs represents a significant influx of institutional capital. At a pre-ETF estimated price of $2.65 per XRP, this capital would attempt to purchase over 20 billion XRP—nearly twice the amount expected to be available. The inability to meet this demand at current prices would necessitate an increase in XRP’s market valuation, balancing demand with available supply. Historical Comparisons and Future Price Potential Previous ETF approvals provide insight into how XRP’s price might respond. The Bitcoin Spot ETF saw over $10 billion in inflows and an 82% increase in Bitcoin’s price. Similarly, Gold ETFs resulted in a fivefold price increase over four years. If XRP follows Bitcoin’s trajectory, its price could rise from $2.65 to at least $4.8 in the short term. If it mirrors gold’s performance, it could reach $10–$20 in a few years. Short-term projections suggest XRP could hit $4–$7 within a month of ETF approval, potentially rising to $10–$15 over the next year as institutional adoption grows. If it gains widespread institutional status like Bitcoin or gold, its value could reach $20–$50 or more. While speculative, these estimates follow historical trends of similar asset transformations.

Portnoy sniped a big portion of the supply early on, while traders later posted deep losses. David Portnoy launched GREED, another meme token with a high-risk profile. The launch arrived just days after Portnoy caused deep losses through the Jailstool token, and later shilled for LIBRA, the failed meme token supposedly backed by Argentina. This time, Portnoy performed an even more blatant rug pull. He bought 35.79% of the supply, then sold all the tokens in a single transaction, making the price tank by 99%. The move on GREED may have been a test of the market, or a demonstration of the risk of meme tokens. However, Portnoy once again caused deep losses for some traders. One wallet lost $101K after sniping GREED. It is unknown if the trader was aware of Portnoy’s involvement. The wallet invested 911 SOL to snipe GREED, but only sold for 309 SOL after the asset tanked. Even after the losses, GREED lined up among trending meme tokens, accumulating 19,982 holders. GREED did not produce any millionaire whales, but top traders still managed to sell on time, locking up to $435.3K in gains. Just as GREED and Greed 2 were pumping and crashing, Portnoy also locked in gains from LIBRA. Portnoy received a compensation of $5M in USDC , which he later converted to SOL and sent to Kraken. The SOL tokens were valued at $5.29M as of February 17, later losing value. The recent pump-and-dump activity from Portnoy is also raising questions about the influencer’s relationship with Kraken. The exchange, one of the fast-growing markets during the bull market, has seen reputational damage , both from connections to Portnoy’s wallets, and from rushing to list high-risk new tokens. David Portnoy goes to war against the meme community The influence of Portnoy was seen as one of the main factors for drawing investors to Jailstool and LIBRA. Some proposed to send the tokens to zero, though at this point, Portnoy had already locked in early gains. As a community We can absolutely cook @stoolpresidente If you hold any #jailstool Pivot to $GREED Show him that he has no power here SEND HIS SHIT TO 0 pic.twitter.com/7P5AsabnHe — Ponzi Trader (@buyerofponzi) February 18, 2025 Portnoy went on to launch Greed2, another high-risk token, which also performed a 10X upward move, followed by a crash. The token came with a high-risk warning, but memes are often sniped by automated bots, leaving each new launch with baseline liquidity. In less than eight hours, Greed2 was already in 9,550 identified Solana wallets, and then was sniped and sold, with the top whale gaining over $280K. Greed2, the second Portnoy token launched in the same day, was also sniped, with a significant part of the supply held in the initial dev wallet. | Source: Bubblemaps Both tokens were tied to Portnoy’s identity from the beginning, but still attracted traders despite the risk. This time around, the launches did not get the same hype as Jailstool. Portnoy himself did not claim to remain a long-term holder, or to support the asset’s cult status. Instead, the launches relied on the overall isolation of meme tokens, where contagion did not spread to the rest of the market. However, the serial launches happened at a time when the crypto community is sobering up from the meme token casino, especially from launches that have insider holders. Portnoy did not end up launching cult coins with long-term holders. Even for Jailstool , he only stated he would hold until the asset hits a $1B market capitalization. At that point, Portnoy went in and crashed the market. I have literally only said I will not sell 1 coin. That coin is #jailstool until it hits 1 billion market cap. Everything else I’ve said I can sell. I’ve warned people. Told em not to buy. I don’t cash out. I’m 600k ish in the red. Yet people call me a scammer. This league — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 18, 2025 The new launches arrived at a time when Solana had the healthiest volumes and was considered the star of the bull cycle. However, the effect of Portnoy and his connections to LIBRA promoter Hayden Davis were among the factors that broke down the interest in new Solana memecoins. Previously, whales and snipers did similar rug pulls, but the high-profile influencers led to deeper losses. The serial launches by Portnoy have invited claims of deliberate scams, despite the disclaimers and warnings about meme tokens. The influencer has received many calls to leave the meme space and stop shilling assets. New Pump.fun launches are slowing down, with under 40K daily launches. Despite this, the market sees over 200K daily active wallets looking for the next breakout. Both Pump.fun and direct launches on DEXs allow for cabal-controlled tokens. In the past, traders have attempted to make gains on cabal-controlled assets, but Portnoy’s actions were too fast in an illiquid market, immediately erasing value.

Analyst Says You Deserve A Slap!,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/think-xrp-is-crashing-analyst-says-you-deserve-a-slap/,"XRP has recently witnessed a notable decline, slipping by 5% over the past week. The altcoin dropped below key levels of $2.40 and $2.45, raising concerns among investors. However, a market analyst believes this price shift is not a sign of a crash but rather part of a bullish ascending triangle formation.

XRP Latest Price Movement XRP is presently trading at $2.56 following an intraday peak of $2.60 and a low of $2.45. The decline coincides with a period of rapid value gain for the token. According to Egrag Crypto, XRP is still in a structured pattern even with the pullback; if confirmed, this might lead to more increases. #XRP – Is Crashing Hard? 😂🚨 I’ll have to give a slap to anyone who mentions “crash” again! 😅 #XRP is simply filling in the ascending triangle formation.

This development is defined by a run of higher lows converging toward a horizontal resistance level. In the past, such circumstances imply an optimistic vibe if the price breaks past the resistance. “XRP is simply filling in the ascending triangle formation,” the analyst said. “The first attempt? Let’s call it a fake-out! Now, we’re just retesting the edge of the formation,” he added. Technical research highlighted this trend in December 2024, with Egrag forecasting ambitious price targets of $17 and $27. A similar examination conducted in October 2024 revealed resistance levels at $0.90 and $1.30, suggesting that overcoming these challenges will open the path for a potential price ascent. Levels Of Resistance And Market Sentiment The latest change in the price of XRP is in line with fluctuations in the market as a whole. Analysts point out important resistance levels that could determine the future path of the token, but some buyers are still wary because of the short-term volatility. Should XRP be able to break out of its current level, and momentum could push it toward bigger targets. External market variables, such as changes in the price of Bitcoin and general sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, will also be very important. Though traditionally optimistic, analysts emphasize that ascending triangles require confirmation through prolonged price action and increased volume.

Traders and investors are evaluating whether this development could help in ETH price surge to $3,000 and above after facing strong selling pressure in recent weeks. Ethereum Transaction Fees Drop to 4-Year Low, Will the Trend Reverse? Popular crypto analyst Miles Deutscher noted that the average transaction fee on the Ethereum network has touched a four-year low at $0.41. Just for context, the transaction fee was at a high point of $15.21 just two years back. However, key developments on the network such as the Dencun upgrade and others have played a key part in this massive fee reduction. Source: The Block Meanwhile, the market sentiment remains divided on the transaction fee drop. Popular crypto analyst Miles Deutscher raised questions about whether ETH gas fee can pick up again as alternative blockchains continue to offer reliable and scalable transaction solutions. He added that Ethereum’s dominance in DeFi and NFTs has waned slightly due to competition. However, he also believes that emerging use cases such as real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and broader adoption of blockchain-based financial instruments could reignite demand for ETH. On the other hand, blockchain analytics firm Santiment reported that low fees typically indicate reduced congestion on the network, suggesting a decline in trading activity or application usage. Analysts often view such periods as favorable for mid-to-long-term ETH price outlook. It further added that extremely low fees, like those currently observed, tend to encourage users to return, potentially boosting the Ethereum network’s utility and activity over time. Source: Santiment ETH Price Recovery Likely Ahead? A recent Ethereum price analysis hints at a potential rally to $10K. However, the sentiment has faded as the altcoin has struggled to hold its crucial support zones in the past. On the other hand, the macro factors are also not in favor of ETH at this point. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has observed a significant shift in ETH price momentum, turning from positive to negative. Source: Ali Charts Blockchain analytics platform SpotOnChain has reported a significant Ethereum transaction from a large-scale investor. The Ethereum whale deposited a net 23,330 ETH, valued at approximately $61.9 million, to Binance over the past four days. The transactions were executed at an average price of $2,654 per ETH, suggesting a potential bearish outlook on the asset. Source: SpotOnChain The only positive development is that Ether ETF inflows have remained strong so far in February. These ETFs have recorded an impressive $393 million in net inflows. Furthermore, BlackRcok Ether ETF (ETHA) has taken the lead significantly outpaces the capital entering Bitcoin ETFs. According to data from Farside Investors, the current inflows into Ether ETFs are now seven times higher than they were in January. As of press time, ETH price is trading 1.7% up at $2,707 with daily trading volume down 17% to $21,5 billion. Market analysts believe that the altcoin season could be at risk if ETH fails to hold the support of $2,600.

Amid speculation of its own public listing, BitGo launched an OTC trading desk to meet rising institutional demand. Meanwhile, Gemini is also exploring an IPO, despite its past regulatory challenges. Public Listings Key to Trust and Transparency BitGo CEO Mike Belsche believes that public listings for crypto companies are essential to help create trust in digital assets and engage with traditional financial institutions. At Consensus Hong Kong 2025 on Feb. 19, Belsche stated that going public is a necessary step for crypto firms who want to interact with Wall Street. He specifically pointed to the failure of FTX as an example of what happens when Wall Street firms try to engage with private crypto entities without adequate due diligence. Some Consensus Hong Kong 2025 speakers Belsche mentioned that financial institutions learned the importance of thorough scrutiny and compliance with regulatory frameworks, particularly those enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He described the transition to public markets as an inevitable step for major players in the industry. Bullish CEO Tom Farley, whose own crypto exchange is reportedly preparing for a public offering, agreed with Belsche’s thoughts. He argued that being listed on a well-respected public market allows possible investors to see a firm’s commitment to transparency and provides reassurance to investors. While neither executive confirmed specific plans for an IPO, they both agreed that public listings could greatly enhance the credibility of major crypto firms. Beyond discussions on public offerings, the executives also commented on the changing regulatory landscape for digital assets under Donald Trump’s administration. Belsche talked about the potential for major policy shifts, given that both the House and Senate are now under Republican control. He is very optimistic about the prospect of pro-crypto appointments at the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and suggested that regulatory changes could take time but will bring meaningful improvements for the industry. Trump’s pro-crypto SEC Chair nominee (Source: Truth Social ) BitGo Unveils OTC Desk Amid Public Listing Speculation BitGo launched a global over-the-counter trading desk for digital assets as reposts suggest the company is getting ready for an initial public offering later this year. The new desk integrates multiple liquidity sources, including exchanges, and provides access to spot and derivatives trading across more than 250 digital assets. It also offers lending services and yield-generating products. BitGo announcement The expansion is happening at a time when there is a surge in institutional crypto OTC trading, which saw a 106% increase in 2024. The growth was largely driven by US President Donald Trump’s election victory and rising demand for US spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Matt Ballensweig, BitGo’s managing director, shared that the new desk allows clients to execute trades across various markets while keeping their assets secure in qualified custody until settlement. BitGo’s platform includes $250 million in insurance coverage and provides venture capitalists and hedge funds with opportunities to buy and sell locked layer-1 tokens. The launch follows the company’s December announcement of a global version of its digital asset solutions tailored for retail investors, including trading, staking, and wallet services. Reports from Bloomberg on Feb. 11 indicated that BitGo has been in discussions with investment banks about a potential public listing in the second half of 2025. However, these plans are still under consideration, and no final decision has been confirmed. If the company moves forward with an IPO, it could join other major crypto firms eyeing the public equity markets. Bitwise IPO predictions for 2025 (Source: Bitwise ) Bitwise predicted in December that at least five crypto unicorns would go public in 2025, including stablecoin issuer Circle, crypto exchanges Kraken and Figure, crypto bank Anchorage Digital, and blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. The trend picked up steam after Coinbase’s landmark decision in 2021 to go public on Nasdaq, which set a precedent for other major players in the crypto industry. BitGo currently claims to have $100 billion in assets under custody. Gemini Also Eyes IPO The founders of crypto exchange Gemini, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, revealed earlier this month that they are reportedly considering an initial public offering as early as this year. Gemini initially explored a public listing in 2021 and is now in discussions with potential advisers about a possible listing, according to a Feb. 6 report from Bloomberg. However, deliberations are still ongoing, and no final decisions have been made yet. The Winklevoss brothers previously indicated that they were open to an IPO, and stated in early 2021 that they were monitoring market conditions and having internal discussions on whether it made sense at the time. Gemini also previously considered merging with Digital Currency Group to create a major player in the crypto custody space, but the deal ultimately fell through. Barry Silbert, the CEO of Digital Currency Group, claimed that the merger could have positioned the companies to compete with major exchanges like Coinbase and FTX, but both firms later faced financial struggles. Digital Currency Group eventually filed for bankruptcy in late 2022. In addition to exploring a public listing, Gemini has been dealing with regulatory and legal challenges. In January, the exchange agreed to pay $5 million to settle a lawsuit with the US commodities regulator over allegations of making false or misleading statements about its 2017 bid to launch the first US-regulated Bitcoin futures contract. The settlement was reached without an admission of liability. NY Department of Financial Services announcement Gemini also facilitated the return of approximately $1.1 billion to customers that were affected by the bankruptcy of Genesis Global Capital, which managed the Gemini Earn Program. Additionally, the platform paid a $37 million penalty for compliance failures that regulators claimed posed risks to the company’s stability. Hong Kong Pledges Open Market for Crypto Growth Some people believe crypto companies should broaden their horizons beyond Wall Street. At Consensus 2025, Hong Kong’s financial secretary Paul Chen Mo-po stated that Hong Kong will continue to provide a stable and dynamic environment for digital assets. He specifically pointed out the city’s investments in infrastructure and talent development, pointing to the role of Cyberport and Science Park as hubs for Web3 innovation and fintech. He also mentioned that collaborations between universities and the industry are fostering a new generation of blockchain experts. Hong Kong has long aimed to establish itself as a leader in financial innovation, with its state-backed Cyberport Web3 network growing rapidly. The initiative was designed to promote digital asset innovation, and now hosts more than 270 blockchain firms, adding over 120 companies in the past 17 months. The city also introduced several regulatory proposals to attract investment, including tax exemptions on crypto gains for hedge funds, private equity, and family offices. According to Mo-po, a successful digital asset ecosystem relies on a regulatory approach that is open, fair, and forward-looking while still supporting responsible financial innovation. However, despite Hong Kong’s efforts to foster a regulated crypto sector, the Securities and Futures Commission issued only nine operational crypto licenses since launching its licensing framework last year. The latest approvals were granted in January to Hong Kong-based exchanges PantherTrade and YAX.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-19 09:41:08

I’ve seen plenty of hyped-up presale coins come and go, but Dawgz AI is different, it’s not just another presale. It’s a game-changer. With a powerful suite of trade bots designed to maximize ROI, this Ethereum-powered project is already making waves. The clock is ticking, and early access investors are positioning themselves for insane gains. Don’t sit on the sidelines, this is your chance to get in before the next crypto boom hits. Will you make your move? Why Crypto Presales Are a Goldmine for Early Investors Most people don’t realize that some of the most successful crypto presales have turned early buyers into millionaires. The ability to buy in before a project goes public can mean massive profits. Getting in Early Before Public Exchanges When you invest in an ongoing presale crypto project, like Dawgz AI ’s coin, you're buying in at the lowest possible price. Once a token hits the public exchange, demand spikes, and prices tend to skyrocket. Many investors regret not participating in early-stage sales, as waiting often means paying much higher prices later. Real Success Stories from Past Presales Consider Ethereum (ETH), during its successful crypto presale, it was selling for $0.30 per token. Today, it’s worth over $2,500! Similarly, Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a meme coin but turned early investors into millionaires when it exploded in value. Crypto Presales Offer the Highest Returns for Fast Movers Presale investors often get additional perks like staking rewards, airdrops, and exclusive bonuses. The crypto presale platform of Dawgz AI, for example, offers an AI-driven ecosystem with real earning potential. Early access investors benefit the most because they lock in the best presale price before demand drives it up. What Makes Dawgz AI the Best Crypto Presale Right Now?

Once this target is hit, the presale price will increase, making now the best time to invest. This presale momentum is a strong indicator that the project has real demand. Strong Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth Token supply and allocation matter. Dawgz AI’s tokenomics ensure stability and longevity: Total Supply: 8.888 billion tokens 30% allocated for presale (ensuring a fair launch) 20% for staking rewards (encouraging long-term holding) 10% for liquidity (reducing volatility) This structure provides a sustainable ecosystem, something many other presale crypto projects lack.

Bullish Global, the cryptocurrency exchange backed by Peter Thiel, has secured two licenses for its Hong Kong arm, allowing it to offer securities dealing and automated trading, along with approval to run a virtual asset trading platform in the city. In a Feb. 19 blog announcement , the exchange said the approval lets it provide regulated digital asset services to eligible customers in Hong Kong. Bullish chief executive Tom Farley says the license serves as a “testament to Bullish’s dedication to expanding our global footprint and continuation of our commitment to being the most trusted digital asset exchange.” Bullish HK will start by serving institutional and professional investors. The licensing follows Bullish’s regulatory approvals in Europe, including a license from Germany’s BaFin.

The total market capitalization has fallen to $3.15 trillion, and Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped to $95,705, causing a ripple effect throughout the market. This decline has triggered massive liquidations, wiping out nearly $298 million in just 24 hours, leaving traders on edge. Over 110K Traders Liquidated According to data from Coinglass , more than 110,705 traders faced liquidations due to the latest market downturn. The total liquidation amount reached $298 million, with long trades suffering the most. Out of the total, $206 million came from liquidated long trades, while short positions accounted for $92 million. The largest single liquidation took place on Binance, where a massive $7.5 million trade was wiped out. Meanwhile, Binance also saw the highest number of liquidations, totaling 38.67% or about $104.03 million. Other major exchanges, such as Bybit, OKX, and Gate.io, also saw big losses, with $50.18 million, $49.59 million, and $31.24 million, respectively. Bitcoin Continues to Test Its Support Level Bitcoin is currently facing a critical test at the $96,000 support level. If it fails to hold above this price, a deeper correction could follow, further shaking investor confidence. One of the key reasons for Bitcoin’s decline is the significant outflows from Bitcoin ETFs. However, data from Farside shows that Bitcoin ETFs saw an outflow of $129 million on February 18, adding more pressure to the asset. As the market struggles continue, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has dropped to 37, showing that traders are getting nervous. Many traders are now betting against Bitcoin’s recovery by opening short positions. Altcoins Also Under Pressure Bitcoin is not the only asset feeling the impact of the market downturn. Leading altcoins, including Solana (SOL), XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE), have also suffered major price declines. The expectation surrounding exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for XRP and Solana has not been enough to stabilize their prices in the short term.

The company has begun repaying an estimated $1.2B to its first wave of former FTX users. The news could have a significant impact not only on the users but on the entire crypto industry as well. Meme coins with utility such as Best Wallet Token are poised to become one of the biggest beneficiaries, as we’ll discuss further in this article. First, let’s talk about the FTX repayments. Repayments Begin, Possibly More on the Way Starting February 18 at 3:00 pm UTC, the exchange has repaid the first batch of over 1,500 former FTX users. This group covers those owed $50K or less. While the repayment is already an eye-watering amount, it’s still a drop in the bucket compared to the total payouts FTX may have to settle. This could balloon to over $16B if all users file claims. FTX’s collapse in November 2022 seems like ancient history now, but it sent shockwaves across the crypto industry. This is partly because of the exchange’s size. Having over 130 subsidiaries meant that the event had a domino effect, which led to bankruptcies and job cuts within these firms. It also had a major impact on Bitcoin’s value. The world’s most valuable cryptocurrency slipped to around $16K during this period after a previous high of nearly $65K. Regulators have reacted swiftly too, and have taken a stricter approach towards crypto as a result. The United States, for instance, has fined exchanges like Binance, which was ordered to pay over $4B in 2023. Meanwhile, FTX’s former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is currently serving a 25-year prison sentence for stealing his customers’ money from the exchange. How the FTX Repayments Will Impact the Market The $1.2B payout is a considerable sum. As such, a portion of this could be reinvested into the crypto market, helping boost demand, especially for meme coins like Best Wallet Token. In addition, the repayments could restore confidence in crypto’s reputation battered by the FTX debacle. Investors who have since become bearish due to the exchange’s collapse may once again have reason to dip their toes into crypto. Not everyone can be expected to be happy with the good news, though. That’s because users will be paid according to crypto prices during the time when FTX went bankrupt, plus a 9% interest per annum. $BTC holders will be particularly unhappy since the digital currency’s value has grown nearly 400% since 2022. Life After FTX The crypto market has changed significantly since the FTX collapse. The number of meme coins and token presales, for example, has boomed, giving investors more options to grow their money. One of the best presales today is the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . The project, spearheaded by the creators of the top-notch crypto wallet, promises to deliver exclusive benefits to its token holders. For one, users will be able to vote on key decisions that affect the Best Wallet ecosystem. If you love the product and want to make it better, holding $BEST tokens will make your voice heard. Aside from that, investors will have first dibs on the team’s new projects and future token releases. This can help you buy coins while they’re still cheap and get an edge over non-token holders. Finally, you can enjoy lower transaction fees and higher APY staking opportunities when you have $BEST. Coinsult has already audited Best Wallet Token in November 2024 in which no major issues were found. This makes it a secure and reliable project to invest in without the risks associated with some token presales. The project has raised over $10.2M to date, making it one of the hottest new cryptocurrencies of 2025 . You can still grab $BEST for only $0.02405 each, but the price is about to increase again in less than two days, so the sooner you purchase, the better. A Word of Advice Before You Invest The crypto market is highly volatile, as we’ve seen with $BTC prices over the past several years. Because of this, do your own research before you invest, and never put down money you can’t afford to lose. Also, consider consulting with a financial advisor about your financial decisions.

His remarks follow the rise of questionable meme coins like LIBRA, MELANIA, and TRUMP, which have faced accusations of price manipulation, centralization, and pump-and-dump schemes. In a post on X (Twitter), Adams suggested that flawed token launches are usually planned, not mistakes. ""It’s not that hard to do a good/fair token issuance. So if a token launch is messed up, it’s probably by design,"" he wrote. This statement implies that some projects deliberately take advantage of investors rather than making errors. One of the most notorious recent cases is the LIBRA meme coin, which was linked to Argentine President Javier Milei . The token initially surged in value, attracting many investors, but later crashed, leaving around 40,000 people with financial losses. Although Milei denied personal involvement, blockchain investigations suggest otherwise. Reports indicate the LIBRA team had previously attempted similar schemes in Nigeria. Other meme coin launches have raised similar concerns. The MELANIA token, associated with former US First Lady Melania Trump , rapidly reached a $2 billion market cap before collapsing. Blockchain analysis revealed that wallets connected to LIBRA were also behind MELANIA, strengthening allegations of coordinated manipulation. Likewise, the TRUMP token followed a similar pattern, gaining value before facing accusations of insider trading and fraud. Investigations found that only 40 wallets controlled most of the supply of TRUMP and MELANIA, fueling worries about price manipulation and lack of decentralization. In response to these issues, many in the Web3 community have demanded clearer guidelines and better practices for token launches. Some argue that serious projects should ensure fairness by using auction-based sales and locking liquidity . One user asked Adams if a guide exists on how to launch tokens safely without sniping and unfair advantages. Others pointed out that Uniswap itself has not done enough to prevent exploitative practices. Criticism was also directed at Uniswap’s governance token, UNI. While Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX), its token is mainly traded on centralized exchanges (CEXs). Some called this ironic, with one user stating, “We end up with the world’s biggest DEX token mostly traded on CEXes: Uniswap can’t even capture its own UNI volume.” Adams’ remarks have intensified discussions about transparency and fairness in crypto. Many argue that platforms like Uniswap should take more steps to prevent unfair launches and protect investors. One critic accused Adams of hypocrisy, stating that Uniswap could have created a fair launchpad with locked liquidity but never did. The controversy continues as the crypto community debates the future of ethical token launches.",,EN,0,0,UNI|BUSINESS|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-19 09:51:23

Social media rumors suggested Murad secretly offloaded a large number of tokens, avoiding public blockchain records. However, Thorn dismissed these allegations, calling them false. Speculation online claimed Murad sold a significant amount of SPX tokens in private over-the-counter (OTC) deals for a lower price. These claims further alleged that Galaxy took control of his wallets by obtaining his seed phrase. Some even suggested that Galaxy was liquidating Murad’s holdings privately while hedging its exposure with short trades. One user on X described it as “a hidden liquidation.” The accusations were supposedly backed by leaked company documents and internal messages from a Galaxy employee, allegedly proving the strategy. Thorn, however, was quick to reject the allegations. He firmly stated, “This is fake.” He also pointed out that the ID badge shown in the leaked images did not belong to anyone on his team. Additionally, the email groups displayed in the supposed leaks were not from any real company mailing list. Thorn emphasized that the story was entirely fabricated to mislead the public. “You are being played by random meme coin scammers ,” he wrote on X. Murad, who has openly supported SPX in the past, was an unexpected target of these rumors. He had previously promoted the token multiple times, calling it a major player in the meme coin space. Earlier this year, he even claimed, “SPX6900 will be the biggest meme coin in history.” However, his involvement in the project had already sparked concerns. A past investigation by blockchain analyst ZachXBT revealed that Murad controlled multiple wallets with large holdings, raising questions about market manipulation. Despite the controversy, the SPX token’s price remained largely unaffected by the rumors. The token had already been in decline and continued its downward trend after a brief recovery. While Murad’s alleged actions caused a stir in the crypto community, they did not significantly impact SPX’s market performance. The discussion surrounding Murad’s involvement and the alleged OTC deals highlights ongoing concerns about transparency in the crypto world. As speculation grows , many in the community are calling for clearer standards and better protections against manipulation.",,EN,0,0,TOKEN SALE|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-19 09:54:48

SingularityNET has partnered with Mind Network to launch the ASI Hub, a decentralized solution aimed at improving the security and reliability of AI agents. To this end, SingularityNet integrated Mind Network’s FHE, a cryptographic technology that allows AI computations to be performed on encrypted data without requiring decryption. Thanks to the FHE technology, companies can offer AI-driven services while ensuring user data remains confidential and secure. You might also like: AI Agent market cap down to $6.6B as top tokens market caps bleed in double digits The adoption of FHE technology may be just the catalyst needed to revive the AI agent narrative, which has declined over the past few months, marked by the AI agent tokens’ total market capitalization dropping from its $10 billion highs to $5.74 billion at the time of writing, according to cookiefun . AI agents are the software entities that operate autonomously or semi-autonomously to perform tasks, make decisions, or interact with users and environments. While AI tokens, on the other hand, are the digital tokens associated with these AI-powered agents. These tokens can be used for governance, access rights, computational services, or incentivizing AI-based ecosystems. The decline in market capitalization specifically refers to AI agent tokens, meaning investor interest in these tradable assets has decreased. But this doesn’t mean that the interest in the AI agent technology itself is declining. Crypto researcher Crypto Stream attributed the decline in AI project tokens to liquidity shifting toward large-cap altcoins, rather than project failures. He believes that liquidity may eventually flow back into AI projects, but this would require three key conditions: large caps must stop pumping, interest in AI agents must persist, and no new dominant narrative should pop up. Apart from FHE technology potentially reviving interest in AI agents , another major development that could serve as a catalyst is OpenAI’s reported efforts to develop its own in-house AI chips with a view to reduce its reliance on NVIDIA . These chips will be manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), with the final design expected to be completed in the coming months.

This move comes amid growing concerns about transparency and the risks of centralized control in the crypto industry. According to Coinbase’s PoR data, the exchange holds 26,525.15 BTC to support a cbBTC supply of 26,461.05 tokens. These tokens are spread across multiple networks, with Ethereum hosting the largest share at 16,080 cbBTC. Other distributions include 7,655.391 cbBTC on Base, 2,673.489 cbBTC on Solana, and 51.395 cbBTC on Arbitrum. To further enhance transparency, Coinbase revealed its Bitcoin addresses and balances. The largest wallet holds 690 BTC, while 40 others contain 480.984 BTC each, with the rest distributed among smaller wallets. This announcement follows criticism from the crypto community, particularly from Tron founder Justin Sun. He previously attacked cbBTC for its lack of transparency and control mechanisms , warning that centralized custody could lead to asset seizures if authorities intervene. Sun claimed cbBTC had no audits and could freeze balances at any time. ""Essentially, it’s just ‘trust me.’ Any US government subpoena could seize all your BTC,"" he warned. Although Coinbase’s PoR provides some reassurance, skepticism remains. Some users pointed to past issues with Solana transactions on the platform. One user on X questioned Coinbase’s reliability, stating, ""You also talked about Proof of Reserve for Solana, but it turned out to be wrong, and our transactions were stuck for over 24 hours."" This refers to a recent incident where Solana deposits and withdrawals faced delays exceeding 14 hours. Critics speculated that Coinbase was staking users’ SOL without consent, causing liquidity shortages when users attempted to withdraw. Another user summarized the issue, stating, ""Deposit SOL to Coinbase, they take your SOL and stake it for profit. But if everyone wants their SOL at the same time, they don’t have it."" Coinbase attributed the delays to ""technical and blockchain issues."" However, users continue to demand more transparency, calling for concrete evidence that their assets remain liquid and accessible. Many believe centralized exchanges must improve their accountability, particularly in managing customer funds. The launch of PoR for cbBTC is a step toward rebuilding trust, but ongoing scrutiny suggests that users remain cautious when using centralized platforms to store and trade their assets.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|SOL|BTC|ARB|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-19 09:59:28

40536256,https://timestabloid.com/?p=57800,1739959275,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,SEC Acknowledges Bitwise’s Filing for Spot XRP ETF,https://timestabloid.com/sec-acknowledges-bitwises-filing-for-spot-xrp-etf/,"In a significant development shared by Cointelegraph, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially acknowledged Bitwise’s filing for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). This acknowledgment does not equate to approval but signals the beginning of the regulatory review process. As the demand for cryptocurrency investment products increases, this filing marks an important step toward integrating digital assets into mainstream financial markets. What Does SEC Acknowledgment Mean? When the SEC acknowledges an ETF filing , the application has been received and will undergo formal review. This includes assessing whether the proposed ETF meets regulatory standards, such as investor protection measures, market surveillance mechanisms, and proper custody arrangements. The acknowledgment also initiates a public comment period, allowing stakeholders to provide feedback before the SEC concludes. While this is a promising development for XRP, the approval process remains complex and uncertain, as the regulatory body has historically been cautious in approving crypto-related financial products. Why an XRP ETF? XRP has long been recognized for its utility in cross-border transactions and financial settlement solutions, making it a unique digital asset in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that primarily serve as speculative investments, XRP has seen adoption among financial institutions seeking efficient and cost-effective transaction methods. This real-world use case, coupled with increased regulatory clarity following the conclusion of a high-profile legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, makes XRP an appealing candidate for an ETF. The 2023 court ruling that XRP’s programmatic sales were not securities has contributed to greater confidence in launching investment products tied to the asset. Potential Implications of an XRP ETF If the SEC approves the spot XRP ETF, it could have profound implications for the financial sector. Institutional investors hesitant to engage directly with cryptocurrencies due to regulatory uncertainty may find a regulated ETF a more secure and compliant avenue for exposure. This could lead to increased adoption of XRP within traditional finance and a potential shift in market dynamics as more investors gain access to the asset through conventional investment platforms. Furthermore, an approved XRP ETF could set a precedent for similar financial products, potentially opening the door for ETFs linked to other altcoins. The regulatory decision could also influence global markets, as authorities in other jurisdictions may look up to the SEC’s stance when considering their cryptocurrency investment frameworks. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Challenges and Uncertainties Despite the enthusiasm surrounding the ETF filing, significant challenges remain. The SEC has maintained a cautious stance on cryptocurrency ETFs, citing market manipulation, regulatory oversight, and investor protection concerns. XRP’s legal history with the SEC could subject this filing to heightened scrutiny, particularly regarding compliance with existing securities laws. Furthermore, larger economic trends and regulatory changes can influence the SEC’s decision-making process, as the agency evolves its stance on digital asset regulation. Given these complexities, the timeline for an official decision remains uncertain, and stakeholders will need to monitor updates from both the SEC and Bitwise. The SEC’s acknowledgment of Bitwise’s spot XRP ETF filing marks an important moment in the ongoing integration of digital assets into the traditional financial system. While the road to approval remains uncertain, this development highlights the increasing dialogue between regulators and the cryptocurrency industry. If approved, the ETF could drive institutional adoption, enhance the legitimacy of XRP, and set a precedent for future crypto investment products. As the review process unfolds, all eyes will be on the SEC’s next moves, as their decision could shape the future of cryptocurrency regulation and investment for years to come.

This move continues the company’s long-standing practice of accumulating BTC through stock offerings. Michael Saylor confirmed that his firm had not acquired any Bitcoin in the past week, briefly interrupting its usual buying streak. Despite this pause, the company remains committed to its Bitcoin strategy. Since it began acquiring Bitcoin, Strategy has become one of the world’s largest holders of the cryptocurrency. Earlier this month, the company broke its 12-week streak of consecutive purchases , though it quickly resumed buying shortly after. Now, Saylor has acknowledged another temporary pause, stating, “Last week, Strategy did not sell any shares of class A common stock under its at-the-market equity offering program and did not purchase any Bitcoin. As of 2/17/2025, we hold 478,740 BTC acquired for ~$31.1 billion at an average of ~$65,033 per Bitcoin.” Shortly after making this announcement, Saylor followed up with another statement: Strategy is launching a private offering of $2 billion in convertible senior notes. The funds raised will be used to buy more Bitcoin , following the same approach as previous stock offerings. To sustain its Bitcoin purchases, Strategy has employed several methods, including selling shares. Recently, this led to BlackRock acquiring a 5% stake in the company. Meanwhile, its Strike Preferred Stock (STRK) has also performed well. The firm’s Bitcoin holdings have appreciated significantly, yet Strategy remains firm in its long-term commitment to holding these assets. Bitcoin’s price has experienced volatility in recent weeks, which may present a buying opportunity for Strategy . After sharp fluctuations, the price is now consolidating just under the $100,000 mark. While this isn’t a major decline, it does allow the company to accumulate more BTC at a slightly lower cost. At the same time, Strategy’s stock ( MSTR ) has underperformed, dropping nearly 15% over the past month. Despite this, the company remains steadfast in its Bitcoin-focused approach. This latest move aligns with Strategy’s well-documented approach—selling stock to increase its Bitcoin reserves. While there have been rumors of potential challenges in executing this strategy, no concrete issues have surfaced. For now, Saylor continues to maintain a highly bullish outlook on Bitcoin and appears committed to this aggressive accumulation strategy.",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|STRK,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-19 10:02:19

PepeGPT’s Crypto Presale Launches Feb 20 – Here’s How to Get In Early,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/pepegpts-crypto-presale-launches-feb-20-heres-how-to-get-in-early/,"The post The Hottest Meme Coin of 2025 Has Arrived! PepeGPT’s Crypto Presale Launches Feb 20 – Here’s How to Get In Early appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Meme coin investors have seen life-changing gains in previous bull cycles, with projects like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe skyrocketing in value after launching at just fractions of a cent. But while meme coins have delivered some of the biggest profits in crypto history, they’ve also been plagued by scams, rug pulls, and unsustainable hype cycles. Now, PepeGPT ($PEPEAI) is changing the game. This AI-powered meme coin is integrating next-generation security, autonomous trading tools, and fraud detection into its ecosystem—solving some of the biggest problems meme coin investors have faced for years. With its official presale launching on February 20, early buyers have a limited window to secure tokens at the lowest possible price before they hit the market. Here’s why PepeGPT is the hottest meme coin of 2025—and how you can get in before prices rise. Less Than 24hrs To Guarantee Low Entry – Join The Whitelist Now Why PepeGPT is the Most Anticipated Meme Coin of 2025 Meme coins have evolved. The days of hype-driven speculation with no real utility are fading, and investors now demand more than just a viral meme to justify long-term holdings. PepeGPT is answering that demand with a groundbreaking AI-powered ecosystem, giving investors a meme coin that actually works for them. Key Features That Set PepeGPT Apart AI-Powered Trading Bots – Automates profitable trades, maximizing returns without manual effort. On-Chain AI Security – Detects and prevents fraud, ensuring a safer investment environment. AI-Driven Governance – Prevents market manipulation and centralized control over token liquidity. Deflationary Tokenomics – Buy-back and burn mechanism increases scarcity, driving long-term value. Predictive Market Analysis – AI scans news, social sentiment, and price movements to provide trading insights. These features go beyond just hype—they make PepeGPT a smarter, more secure meme coin investment. For investors looking for 100x potential in the next big meme coin, PepeGPT is one of the most promising projects launching in 2025. The Power of Early Investment – Why Timing Matters in Crypto Presales In the world of cryptocurrency, timing is everything. History has proven that early investors in high-potential presales often secure the highest returns, and PepeGPT is offering a rare opportunity to buy in before it hits the mainstream market. Why Early Investors See the Biggest Gains Crypto presales allow investors to acquire tokens before they are listed on major exchanges, often at a fraction of their potential market value. This first-mover advantage means early buyers secure tokens at the lowest price possible, well before demand surges during public listings. Some of the biggest success stories in crypto have been presale investors who got in early and held through the price discovery phase. Ethereum’s ICO (2015): Investors who purchased ETH at $0.31 per token saw it rise to over $4,800, delivering over 1.5 million percent returns at its peak. BNB Presale (2017): Binance Coin (BNB) launched at $0.15 per token during its presale and eventually hit over $700 per token, generating astronomical gains for early adopters. Shiba Inu (2020): What started as a low-cap meme coin presale skyrocketed to become a top 20 cryptocurrency, minting multiple millionaire investors in the process. These examples highlight the undeniable power of getting in early, and PepeGPT presents a similar opportunity to invest at presale prices before AI-driven meme coins become the next big trend. Final Thoughts – Why PepeGPT is the Meme Coin to Watch in 2025 PepeGPT is more than just another meme coin riding the hype cycle. With its AI-powered security, automated trading, and deflationary tokenomics, it is positioned to dominate the next wave of meme coin investments. Investors who missed out on Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe Coin now have another chance to get in early on what could be the biggest meme coin of 2025. But with the presale launching on February 20 and price increases in every stage, time is running out to secure tokens at the lowest entry point.

His contribution to the enhancement of Binance made the platform the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange since its inception in 2017.

What is the net worth of Changpeng Zhao? Changpeng's net worth is $6,260 crores.2. What are the latest investments of Changpeng Zhao?Changpeng Zhao investing in the blockchain sector as well as artificial intelligence and biotechnology Entrepreneur Investor Chief Executive Officer has stepped in to support investors who lost money in the recent pump-and-dump of the TST token and BROCCOLI meme coin. His post about donating funds to affected investors has reignited the meme coin mania, underscoring the ongoing cycle of speculation, hype, and financial risk in the crypto space. What Happened with TST and BROCCOLI? The chaos began when CZ shared an educational video about the BNB Chain , featuring a token called Test (TST) as an example. This led to the creation of a TST meme coin, which saw a surge in trading despite CZ having no direct involvement. Meanwhile, another meme coin named BROCCOLI took off after CZ mentioned his dog’s name, fueling speculation. Initially, these tokens experienced 50% gains—BROCCOLI, for example, jumped 160% at launch. However, the rally was short-lived. Both tokens crashed by more than 60-80% in just days, triggering panic among traders who had jumped in hoping for quick profits. CZ Steps in to Compensate Investors Seeing the financial damage caused by the hype, CZ decided to take action. He announced that any funds sent to his address would be donated to victims of TST and BROCCOLI. Additionally, he donated 150 BNB (worth about $100,000) to a university student who had already contributed $50,000 to help victims of another crypto project, Libra. CZ clarified that his donations do not mean he endorses these tokens. “I won’t be keeping a satoshi of it. Will donate it away, most likely to people who had a loss on TST or some of the Broccolis,” he wrote on X. He also warned investors against reading too much into his actions, reminding them that speculation often leads to losses. After completing his four-month prison sentence on September 27, 2024, CZ wants to clean his public image and this compensation move could be a strategy to divert any negative talks. Moreover, he is now focusing more on investing and launching his digital education platform, Giggle Academy to educate new investors. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Binance Delisting Alert: 5 Crypto Trading Pairs to Be Removed on Feb. 21 , A Reminder About Meme Coin Risks CZ’s latest move serves as a warning about the unpredictable nature of meme coins . He also pointed to the LIBRA token , which went through a similar pump-and-dump cycle after being linked to Argentina’s President Javier Milei . Echoing a similar sentiment, Crypto expert Clayton Lowery, explains that many new tokens are created just to make quick money and disappear. Data from Chainalysis shows that in 2024, over 400,000 tokens were launched in just one month, but only 1.7% are still actively traded. This means most tokens either fail or are abandoned after the hype fades. Lowery also points out that 94% of suspected pump-and-dump tokens were scams where creators took the money and ran, while 6% were manipulated by insiders. However, not all meme coins are bad—some try to build real value through community involvement or useful features. Experts advise investors to look for projects with real utility rather than just hype to avoid getting caught in scams. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

He shared this view in a discussion with Trust Wallet CEO Eowyn Chen, highlighting how wallets are evolving beyond simple storage. Although CZ no longer leads Binance, he remains active in the industry through YZI Labs and the Giggle Academy . During the conversation, he emphasized that crypto exchanges should be liquidity pools for large traders, not platforms for everyday users. “Most people shouldn’t have to use an exchange,” CZ stated, arguing that wallets like Trust Wallet are more suitable for daily crypto interactions. His comments reflect a growing trend in the industry. Crypto wallets, once seen only as storage solutions, now support financial transactions, digital identities, and DeFi services. Users can manage wealth, send remittances, and access decentralized apps—all without relying on exchanges. Eowyn Chen confirmed that Trust Wallet has experienced rapid growth , now serving millions of users worldwide. “We have almost 200 million downloads, and this represents 77% of finance registration users,” she stated. The platform is shifting from serving speculative traders to providing decentralized finance solutions for everyday users. CZ also pointed out that wallets could play a key role in digital identity and government services . Many governments are exploring blockchain-based identity solutions, and wallets could become the primary gateway for secure credentials. “Governments looking into blockchain will need a decentralized ID solution. The wallet is like the browser for the internet—it’s the key infrastructure,” CZ explained. As discussions continue about user privacy and market regulations, Chen noted that separating wallets from exchanges allows platforms to serve different types of users. By focusing on financial tools and identity management, wallets can expand their role beyond finance into education and public services. She suggested that digital certificates, government access, and educational resources could all be integrated into wallets, making them an essential tool for modern digital life. This shift highlights the changing role of crypto wallets, moving from passive storage to active financial and identity management. The conversation suggests that blockchain adoption will continue to grow as wallets provide more functions for everyday use.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|BNB|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-19 10:05:11

Binance founder CZ announced that he donated 150 BNB to a student campaign supporting LIBRA victims. CZ said that after the LIBRA victims, it will also help investors affected by significant losses in tokens called TST and BROCCOLI. Making a statement from the X account, CZ said that the address to which he sent 150 BNB donations for LIBRA victims received more BNB and various tokens than he sent.

Stating that he will not keep any of the BNB and various tokens sent to his address, CZ said that he will donate these funds to TST and BROCCOLI victims. “Funny things happen in crypto. When you try to make money fast, you will most likely lose. When you give your money away, you get more back. I donated 150 BNB (~$100,000 USD) to a college student who put up $50,000 of his own money to help Libra victims. Now the address has received more BNB and more tokens than I donated. I won't keep a single satoshi of this. I'll probably donate it to people who lost money on TST or Broccoli's. This is NOT an endorsement for any of the tokens sent. Don't over-interpret this.” As you may recall, CZ recently announced that he has a dog named BROCCOLI, and many memecoins named BROCCOLI have emerged since then. Although the BROCCOLI price increased by 160% when it was first launched, the token has fallen by more than 75% since its peak, causing many investors to lose money due to FOMO. Likewise, the TST token experienced a huge increase after its launch due to its connections with CZ, but then experienced a huge dump. Funny things in crypto. When you try to make quick money, you often lose. When you give money away, you get more back.

But that euphoria didn’t last. Though the crypto bull market continued into early 2025, Finbold research found that the Republican’s return to the White House had the opposite effect, leading to stagnation and decline. Between January 21 – the day after the inauguration – and February 18, the number of BTC addresses holding more than $1 million worth of the coin dropped by 22,279. During the first weeks of President Trump’s second term, an average of 795 Bitcoin millionaire addresses were wiped daily as per data retrieved from BitInfoCharts using the Wayback Machine web archive tool. Notably, the starkest decline was in the number of addresses holding over $1 million in BTC, which fell from 157,563 to 138,693. High-value wallets with more than $10 million also dropped significantly, from 18,801 to 15,392. However, this downward trend extended across all wallet sizes. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); Bitcoin losses under Trump extend beyond millionaire wallets Indeed, there are now nearly 3 million fewer addresses with a balance between $1 and $9,999 at press time compared to January 21, while the number of those with between $10,000 and $999,999.99 likewise witnessed a sharp, 641,489 reduction. In total, the erasure of 3.54 million addresses with $1 or more worth of Bitcoin means that, on average, Donald Trump’s second administration oversaw the wiping of an average of 126,262 daily. It is important to note that the number of affected addresses doesn’t necessitate an equal number of traders being affected, as one person can have multiple Bitcoin addresses, or multiple people can pool their resources into one. How the election pump turned into the inauguration dump The swift transition from optimism to uncertainty that occurred almost as soon as Donald Trump stopped being President-Elect and became just the President can be traced back to a series of shocks affecting the market in recent weeks. Just days after the inauguration, the novel Chinese artificial intelligence ( AI ) model DeepSeek was released, triggering a massive technology sector selloff that had a spillover effect in the cryptocurrency market. The greater finance ecosystem was also impacted one week later as President Trump’s planned – and either implemented or postponed – tariffs against China, Mexico, and Canada added to the uncertainty. Even more recently, the latest figures demonstrated an uncomfortable rise in inflation in early 2025, mere days after the president advocated for further interest rate cuts. While President Trump remained adamant that inflation is the result of Joe Biden’s policy – and while he certainly had no direct role in the DeepSeek disruption – he may have, nonetheless, triggered the crypto market slowdown more directly. Is Donald Trump to blame for the stagnating crypto market? Specifically, the Trump family released a set of self-themed meme coins for the inauguration. Though these are, arguably, not as bad as most ‘pump and dump’ schemes as they are akin to commemorative coins, they remain uncomfortable as there has been an uptick in fraudulent digital asset launches in recent months. The recent and high-profile examples of the trend came with the controversial cryptocurrency launched by Haliey Welch – the Hawk Tuah Girl – and the one tentatively promoted by Argentinian president Javier Milei. Finally, along with some of Trump’s actions possibly giving headwinds for the cryptocurrency, his inaction might have also contributed. Ahead of the election, the President was adamant about establishing a national Bitcoin – and potentially other digital assets – reserve. Despite pre-election promises, Trump has yet to establish a national Bitcoin reserve. Whether this policy takes shape in the coming months remains to be seen.

The network was under development and testing for two and a half years before its mainnet was launched in 2020. It’s a network of interconnected sidechains designed to scale Ethereum DApps. SKALE provides transactions without fees and high transaction throughputs, enabling developers to create DApps without concern for high gas fees. The governance of the SKALE network is handled by the SKALE DAO, which includes over 50 members, comprising business organizations, other DAOs, and companies.

Among the numerous altcoins that have recently provided excellent profits is the SKL cryptocurrency. In reality, if we take the period from October 2023 to April 2024 into consideration, the SKL token rose by more than 400%. Can the SKL token rise much higher now that it has made some significant gains? The asset’s chart shows that it is still far from its peak; in fact, over the past few months, its value has dropped. Despite this setback, the cryptocurrency still has room to rise. Why is SKALE up? The SKALE/USD crypto pair price has spiked today as the buying influx has returned after yesterday’s selloff, surging the price to $0.0338. The bulls are targeting the resistance of $0.0351 next, but overall, the coin’s value has decreased significantly by 9.08% over the past week. Will SKALE recover? SKALE is currently bearish but continues to recover slowly. Though the crypto pair is trading below its yearly high, it is expected to recover because the RSI is also trending near the center line of the indicator. Will SKALE reach $0.100? Yes, SKALE should rise to touch $0.100 some time near the start of 2027 and can reach a maximum price of $0.122 during that period. Will SKALE reach $0.200? Yes, SKALE should rise above $0.200 in 2030. It is expected that by the year end, it will reach a maximum price of $0.218. Will SKALE reach $0.500? Per the SKALE price prediction, it is expected that the token may not get to $0.5, but it will reach $0.251 by 2031. Is Skale a good project? The SKALE blockchain platform is focused on improving the scalability of Ethereum. SKALE can handle a large number of transactions, which is essential for dApps to function smoothly. Users also don’t have to pay gas fees, which makes it more appealing, and it has seen growing adoption among the gaming community with many web3 games being built on the platform. Like any cryptocurrency, SKALE token is also volatile, but for investors, it is important to believe in the long-term potential of the project. Does Skale Network have a future? According to analysts’ price predictions, SKALE will trade higher in years to come. The token’s value is expected to increase many folds reaching a potential higher price of $0.251 by 2031. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory.

In a recent tweet, Ali posted a four-hour XRP/USDT chart from Binance, highlighting a buy signal. The TD Sequential indicator, a widely used tool in technical analysis, is signaling a potential shift in momentum, which could lead to a price increase. $XRP could be gearing up for a rebound, as the TD Sequential indicator flashes a buy signal on the 4-hour chart! Watching for confirmation! pic.twitter.com/ljd1BBamdk — Ali (@ali_charts) February 17, 2025 Understanding the TD Sequential Indicator The TD Sequential is a technical indicator developed by Tom DeMark, designed to identify potential trend reversals. It consists of a setup phase (nine consecutive candles meeting specific conditions) and a countdown phase (thirteen candles). When the sequence completes, it often signals exhaustion in the current trend and a potential reversal. In Ali’s shared chart, the TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal, represented by the number “1” and an upward arrow. This typically suggests that the downtrend may be losing strength and that a reversal could be imminent. Traders often look for confirmation through subsequent price action before entering positions. Market Context and XRP Price Action XRP has experienced a downward trend, as seen in the chart, with a series of bearish candles forming lower highs and lower lows. However, the recent buy signal indicates a possible shift in sentiment. If confirmed, XRP could see a short-term rally, attracting traders looking for a potential bounce. Ali’s analysis aligns with his previous bullish outlook on XRP. Recently, he pointed out that XRP had formed a cup and handle pattern , a classic bullish technical formation that suggests a potential breakout. According to his prediction, if XRP breaks above key resistance levels, it could move beyond $3. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What to Watch Next For traders considering Ali’s analysis, confirmation of the buy signal is crucial. Some key factors to monitor include: Price Action Above Key Levels – If XRP moves above recent resistance zones, it could validate the bullish outlook. Volume Increase – A spike in trading volume would indicate strong buying pressure, supporting the potential reversal. Market Sentiment – Broader market trends, including Bitcoin’s performance and overall crypto market conditions, can influence XRP’s price movement. While technical indicators like the TD Sequential provide valuable insights, it is essential to incorporate multiple factors before making trading decisions. Crypto markets remain highly volatile, and risk management is always necessary. Whether this buy signal translates into a meaningful upward move remains to be seen, but the setup warrants attention.

Despite multiple attempts to break higher, BTC has struggled to gain momentum, keeping price action range-bound. However, a breakout from this consolidation could reignite bullish sentiment, potentially pushing Bitcoin toward $107,000 in the coming weeks, as noted by analyst RLinda. Technical outlook: Bitcoin key levels to watch Bitcoin is consolidating within a tight range between $94,800 and $98,400, with a breakout from this zone likely to determine its next major move. BTC price analysis chart. Source: RLinda/TradingView A decisive push above $98,400 could shift market sentiment, potentially driving BTC toward $100,200, $102,700, and ultimately $107,000. However, the broader technical outlook suggests that Bitcoin could first test liquidity at $91,000 and $90,000 before resuming an upward trajectory. On the downside, $94,800 remains a critical support level, with the analyst cautioning that a failure to hold this range could accelerate a decline toward $91,300 and further down to $90,000. Should buyers step in at these lower levels, Bitcoin could stage a bullish reversal, setting the stage for a rally toward new highs. More bullish projections CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju also remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, highlighting that the bull cycle remains intact despite short-term consolidation. “I don’t think we’ll enter a bear market this year. We’re still in a bull cycle. The price would eventually go up, but the range seems broad. I personally think that the bull cycle could continue even with a -30% dip from ATH (e.g., 110K → 77K), as seen in past cycles.” — Ki Young Ju According to Young Ju, Bitcoin’s price range is expected to remain broad, but its overall trend remains upward. He notes that even if Bitcoin experiences a 30% correction from an all-time high to $77,000, a scenario observed in past cycles would not mark the start of a bear market . Instead, such a correction would represent a normal retracement within a larger bullish phase, keeping BTC well above its previous cycle’s all-time high. BTC price analysis At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $96,339, posting a 0.7% gain in the past 24 hours and a modest 0.21% increase over the past week. While BTC has held steady, market conditions remain cautious, with no clear catalyst for a breakout. BTC seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold A combination of Federal Reserve policy uncertainty and escalating trade tensions have added to economic concerns, weighing on investor sentiment and limiting risk appetite for speculative assets like Bitcoin. Adding to the unease, Bitcoin investment products saw $430 million in outflows last week, marking the largest single-week decline of 2025, as noted in a CoinShares report. This shift ends a 19-week streak of institutional inflows, during which Bitcoin investment vehicles accumulated $29 billion since the 2024 U.S. election .

With the major improvements that this network brings, it could bring a solid surge in ETH’s price. Meanwhile, PlutoChain could bring a hybrid Layer-2 platform that might activate new functionalities in Bitcoin’s ecosystem. Let’s check out all the details below. Ethereum Price Prediction: Can the Long-Awaited Pectra Upgrade Bring a New ATH for ETH? Ethereum’s long-awaited Pectra upgrade is officially set to launch on April 8, following testnet deployments on Holesky (February 24) and Sepolia (March 5). The timeline was confirmed during Ethereum’s latest core developer call by Tim Beiko of the Ethereum Foundation. One of Pectra’s key improvements is expanding blobspace from three to six blobs per block, improving Layer 2 scalability, and reducing fees. The upgrade also introduces execution-layer optimizations and strengthens Ethereum’s deflationary model by accelerating ETH burn rates. While Pectra could positively impact ETH’s price, market sentiment remains cautious. ETH has struggled to reclaim the $3,000 mark, trading around $2,700 recently. However, on-chain metrics suggest growing adoption. DefiLlama data shows Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL) at its highest level since 2022, and ETH ETFs have attracted $3.14 billion in net inflows. With Cboe BZX’s recent SEC filing to enable staking for the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF, demand for ETH may increase in the coming months. In a recent post on X, crypto angel investor VirtualBacon expressed confidence in Ethereum’s coming market dominance, urging followers not to miss the opportunity. His prediction for ETH is $14,000. PlutoChain’s Hybrid Layer-2 Technology Could Expand Bitcoin’s Capabilities and Solve Key Challenges PlutoChain, a new blockchain project, is developing a hybrid Layer-2 infrastructure that may enhance Bitcoin’s ecosystem by addressing some of its biggest limitations. One of Bitcoin’s long-standing challenges is its slow transaction speed due to 10-minute block intervals. PlutoChain’s Layer-2 solution offers a block time of just 2 seconds. Additionally, it could introduce smart contract functionality, opening the door for more advanced blockchain applications. A defining feature of PlutoChain is its integration with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), potentially bridging Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum’s well-established development environment. This cross-chain compatibility might enable Bitcoin-native applications in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and AI-powered tools. Preliminary tests indicate high scalability, with PlutoChain’s testnet processing over 43,200 transactions per day. Another factor that could set PlutoChain apart is its decentralized governance structure, allowing the community to have greater control over protocol decisions. Security has also been a major focus, with audits conducted by independent firms like SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi. PlutoChain may help transition Bitcoin from a store of value to a more functional and versatile blockchain platform, without compromising its foundational security. The Bottom Line The Ethereum Pectra upgrade is set to increase scalability, lower costs, and reinforce Ethereum’s deflationary model, potentially driving increased adoption and price momentum. But, while Ethereum refines its ecosystem, PlutoChain dcould expand Bitcoin’s utility beyond a store of value. With a hybrid Layer-2 solution with EVM compatibility, PlutoChain could enable faster transactions and smart contract functionality while preserving Bitcoin’s security. ——- This article is not financial advice.

At this point, while ETF applications are being made for altcoins such as XRP, Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), analysts currently think that LTC has a higher chance of receiving ETF approval. Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart published a report last week specifically listing the approval possibilities of Litecoin, Solana, XRP and Dogecoin ETFs and the deadlines for a decision by the SEC. Accordingly, analysts determined the probability and dates as 90% – 02/10/2025 for Litecoin; 70% – 10/10/2025 for Solana; 65% – 17/10/2025 for XRP and 75% – 18/10/2025 for Dogecoin. While the SEC recently accepted the evaluation of XRP ETF applications, Bloomberg analyst Eric Blachunas made important statements in a podcast he attended yesterday. Balchunas noted that the SEC’s decision to consider XRP ETFs is a significant development, as it means that XRP and other altcoins with ETF applications may no longer be classified as securities by the SEC. Balchunas also stated that this situation also points to a change in the way cryptocurrencies are handled in the US, and added that the ongoing crypto cases filed by the SEC will also be re-evaluated. Will Altcoin ETF Approval Come in 2025? Eric Balchunas also discussed the potential for other altcoins like Dogecoin and Cardano to follow suit with the XRP ETF. The analyst said that while the SEC's latest move is an encouraging sign, there is still uncertainty about when a final decision will be made, and the small possibility of not approving it should not be ignored. Opening a separate parenthesis for Litecoin, the analyst stated that LTC is the altcoin with the highest probability of ETF approval because it is similar to Bitcoin and is seen as a commodity, and they expect the LTC ETF to be approved in 2025. Finally, touching on XRP and Solana, Balchunas said that while there is more uncertainty for SOL and XRP ETFs, the SEC's latest move paves the way for more filings and decisions in the coming months. *This is not investment advice.

U.S. states are considering establishing Strategic Bitcoin Reserves, potentially leading to significant BTC purchases, reflecting growing institutional acceptance. UAE's Mubadala Investment Company invested $460 million in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, signaling potential similar moves by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. The Fort Knox episode could also highlight BTC's potential against its gold rival. Despite recent pessimism, these developments present a massive opportunity for investors to initiate or strengthen BTC exposure. Introduction Since my initiation , Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has performed by +67% versus +10% for the S&P 500 (SPX). However, for about three months now, BTC has been ranging between $91,000 and $109,000. As I'm writing this article, it stands at $95,641. TradingView In this logic, my last recommendation published on January 7, 2025, and which was my 3rd update on the matter, hasn't performed well. Since I published it, BTC has been down -1.2% while the SPX has been up +3.48%. In the article that I invite you to look at, I mentioned a major catalyst that I expect to support BTC in 2025. Despite these positive triggers I have identified, it is undeniable that the current range we are sitting in has brought a wave of pessimism among many investors. As a matter of fact, the BTC fear and greed index is now back in neutral territory. alternative.me In this article, I'm going to explain why I believe this situation represents a massive opportunity for investors to initiate or strengthen their BTC exposure. U.S. States Adoption Recently, we've seen many bills related to the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve introduced in multiple U.S. states. As of today, 22 bills have been introduced in 22 different states. These states will soon have the responsibility to decide if they want to have the possibility to invest in BTC. Bitcoinlaws The process is long and can take anywhere from a few months to over a year. After a bill is introduced in the state legislature, it gets debated in the first legislative committee. Then, it moves to the first chamber, where it is debated and voted on. If approved, the bill goes to a second committee in the other chamber for review. There, it is debated and voted on again. If both chambers pass the bill, it is sent to the governor for signing into law. According to VanEck , if voted across all states, this could potentially represent 250 000 BTC purchased in the future. This is almost 1.15% of the total supply and 1.3% of the circulating supply. VanEck In my opinion, these calculations must be considered carefully, as there is a high probability that not all states will cross the line and adopt BTC. However, I still interpret this trend very positively. It proves BTC has come a long way and is now even being considered for an investment envelope that requires the highest level of scrutiny: state funds investing citizens money. UAE - The First Country Checked Off my 2025 Bingo list... and More Will Join The Party In my previous article , I shared my 2025 Bingo list, where I identified countries, I expected to embrace BTC this year. Among them, I notably mentioned Switzerland, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, and South American countries like Argentina. A few days ago, an interesting news report came out. According to Yahoo Finance : Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala Investment Company, disclosed a $460 million stake in BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, making it the seventh-largest holder of this ETF. In my opinion, this is just the beginning. Now that the UAE has crossed the line, I expect another country to get in the game soon: Saudi Arabia. Why? Because these countries have historically competed, especially when it comes to investing. A few examples: both have aggressively deployed capital in the technology sector, both have fought to become the financial hub of the Middle East, and even in sports and entertainment, the UAE was the first to make significant investments in European football clubs, while Saudi Arabia followed by acquiring Newcastle United. In my opinion, with Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund now investing in Bitcoin ETFs, it's only a matter of time before Saudi Arabia follows. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund manages over $900 billion in assets, making it the 6th largest sovereign wealth fund globally. BTC aligns with the nation's goal of diversifying beyond oil. That's why I believe this country could be a potential buyer, and a game-changer for BTC. Visual Capitalist What About the US Strategic Reserve? First, an important element to consider: the U.S. still holds 207,189 BTC. There was a non-zero probability that the Biden administration would sell BTC holdings before Trump took office, but it didn't happen. This is very positive, as it suggests a potential bipartisan consensus on the matter. Since Trump has taken office, we haven't had any specific news about the so-called U.S. strategic reserve. However, another positive development has emerged. On February 3rd , President Trump signed an executive order for the creation of a Sovereign Wealth Fund. This comes along with the task assigned to Crypto Czar David Sacks to study the feasibility of a Bitcoin reserve or a digital asset stockpile. In a sense, I believe these two elements are related and could both serve as positive catalysts for BTC. It seems plausible that the U.S. sovereign wealth fund, which is expected to total $5.7 trillion in assets, could also invest in Bitcoin, just like the UAE did. Trump has given 90 days to the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Treasury to create this fund, so we will have news soon enough. In my opinion, these two developments represent real catalysts that will support BTC and strengthen its reputation as a reserve asset. Speculation Rising over Fort Knox Built in 1930, Fort Knox serves as the U.S. Bullion Depository, housing 147 million ounces of gold, worth approximately $425 billion. As gold prices rise and the Department of Government and Efficiency ((DOGE)) shakes up the U.S. administration, public interest in Fort Knox's actual reserves has surged. Due to growing distrust over how poorly U.S. taxpayers' money has been managed over the past decade, many are questioning whether the reported gold reserves are accurate. This skepticism has only been reinforced by multiple sources alleging that the last official audit of Fort Knox took place back in 1974. Twitter You might be wondering: how does this relate to BTC? If an audit is indeed conducted and reveals that gold reserves are missing, I have the conviction that it will reignite the gold vs. BTC debate. The idea of gold as the ultimate store of value would take a hit, and BTC, with its verifiable and transparent supply, could emerge as an even stronger alternative. In a world where trust in traditional assets is eroding, BTC's appeal as a decentralized, non-manipulable form of wealth storage could gain significant traction. To close this article, I wanted to share this data that, I believe, is crucial. It shows how the ETF and financialization of BTC represent a real advantage for BTC holders, driving demand and making BTC an even scarcer asset over the long term. Indeed, as time goes by and halving makes it even harder to mine BTC every four years, the new BTC supply continues to decrease. Meanwhile, ETF demand appears strong even a year after their launch. As you can see, despite BTC's poor price action on a YTD basis, net inflows into U.S. spot BTC ETFs have outweighed new supply in 2025 by a factor of 2.68x. Bitwise Meanwhile, BTC reserves on exchanges continue to decrease and currently stand at 2.23 million. Coinglass Conclusion Despite the current price action disappointing many BTC holders, I still believe there is significant upside potential in 2025, with major triggers and catalysts on the horizon. I consider the current level attractive, and I remain particularly optimistic about BTC's future. Periods of consolidation often test investor patience, but history has shown that Bitcoin tends to move in strong cycles, with explosive price action following phases of accumulation. Given the current setup, I have the conviction that we are in such a phase, making this an attractive time to accumulate for those with a long-term view. The braves will be rewarded. I remain optimistic about BTC's future and maintain my Strong Buy rating.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-02-19 11:54:38

Is this a perfect time to buy, or could the $SOL price fail to recover? What are the chances that $SOL price will now fall away? When $SOL went to $8 in the depths of the last bear market, it was a brave soul who was buying it. But those who did, probably knew that the fundamentals for Solana were unchanged. They knew that this layer 1 network had the potential to challenge Ethereum for most of the transactional value across all the layer 1 and 2 blockchains, and their bet paid off handsomely. Now, once again, $SOL is in trouble. It’s still a long, long way from that $8 bottom, but it did fall through its bull market trendline, albeit very briefly, and with just a couple of daily candle wicks. Therefore it now needs to be considered. What are the chances that the most serious challenger to Ethereum (if one discards Ripple $XRP and Binance $BNB) will now sink into oblivion? It just isn’t going to happen. The Solana ecosystem has been doing as much as 75% of the transactional value across the whole of crypto in recent times. On most other metrics, Solana also leads. Bull market trendline holds Source: TradingView The daily chart above shows how the $SOL price has consolidated above the bull market trendline. As long as this remains intact, a bounce to the upside is more likely than not. It could also be said that the big fall in the $SOL price did confirm the top of the descending trendline, although at a much lower level. It might be expected that the price does start to climb from here, and the major horizontal resistance at $202 will be the target. Major indicators are signalling a bounce to come Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $SOL puts everything into perspective. The bull market trendline looks to be holding, and this is bolstered by the major horizontal support at $174. Also, at the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index is showing that a bounce of the indicator line from the 46.00 level would be a very bullish move. This level has been both support and resistance since early 2022, and so could provide a bounce. Just below this indicator, right at the bottom of the chart, is the Stochastic RSI. This momentum indicator is showing that the indicator lines are bottoming. Once they cross back up and cross the 20.00 level, some very powerful upside price momentum should come into the market.

This scenario prompts investors to question: is now an opportune time for investment, or could the value continue to decline? Evaluating Solana's Resilience and Future Prospects Reflecting on the past, when Solana's price plummeted to $8 during a tough bear market, investors who had the foresight to buy then reaped considerable rewards. This was attributed to an unwavering belief in Solana's foundational strengths. Fast forward to today, $SOL faces adversity again. Despite distancing itself from its historic lows, it momentarily breached its bullish trendline. The pressing question remains: will Solana, recognized as a formidable competitor to Ethereum, manage to remain afloat amid these challenges? Given the platform's recent performance, contributing to a substantial portion of the transactional activities in the crypto sphere, its future still holds promise. A Glimpse at Solana's Stability and Prospects As evidenced by the daily chart, the price consolidates above its crucial bullish trendline, suggesting potential recovery. This stable footing could see $SOL target significant resistance points, like the $202 level. Analyzing the Indicators: Signs of Recovery? Examining the weekly chart, it's apparent that the bullish trajectory holds firm. Reinforcement is observed near the horizontal support of $174, fortifying this outlook. Additionally, key indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index, hint at bullish movements if it bounces from the 46.00 level. Furthermore, the Stochastic RSI signals potential upward momentum. Once these indicators show a positive crossover, it might signal a strong price increase, indicating that dismissing Solana now could be premature.

As a result, the BTC Volatility Index ( DVOL ) on popular options exchange Deribit has been dropping since Jan. 20, falling from a high of 72 to around 50.8. The drop signals bitcoin's maturation as an asset, according to Tracy Jin, COO of cryptocurrency trading platform MEXC. ""Rather than reacting sharply to short-term market shocks, BTC is showing signs of stabilization, increasingly resembling the dynamics of commodity markets and traditional safe-haven assets,” Jin said. While FTX creditor payouts have started rolling out, the Libra token debacle just keeps intensifying. The co-creator of the token, Hayden Davis, bragged about buying access to Argentine President Javier Milei’s inner circle ahead of the memecoin’s launch, according to messages reviewed by CoinDesk. Meanwhile, Strategy, the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, is set to r aise an additional $2 billion by selling zero-coupon convertible notes. The funds raised will mostly be used to accumulate more BTC. As Brevan Howard Digital’s CEO and CIO — that's just one person — stressed at Consensus Hong Kong, the cryptocurrency ecosystem has evolved since the collapse of FTX, but 24/7 risk management is still a necessity. On the macro front, traders are focusing on minutes from the Federal Reserve’s January interest rate meeting. Indications of the potential impact of increased tariffs are a particular point of focus, given President Donald Trump’s comments on tariffs “in the neighborhood of 25% for automobiles, semiconductors, and pharmaceutical products.” Recent U.S.-Russia talks in Riyadh have led to the appointing of teams to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine and commitments to “normalize the operation” of their diplomatic missions. Still, excluding representatives from Ukraine and Europe remains a point of contention. Stay alert!

The surge has been attributed to an increase in on-chain activity and a boost in general sentiment following the rebrand. The memecoin sector is reeling from the controversy over Argentine President Javier Milei and the Libra token. The market cap of the sector is down 4.4% in 24 hours to $72.9 billion as traders begin to pull liquidity and question the legitimacy of a market many view as an endless cycle of ""pump and dumps."" More than $35 billion worth of value has exited decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols since mid-December.

That's a sign of bullish expectations becoming tempered amid continued sideways price movement. LTC, TRX and HYPE lead growth in perpetual futures open interest.

The license allows the platform to operate as a virtual asset exchange and offer broker-dealer and investment management services in the region. It positions MANTRA, which focuses on the Middle Eastern region, for global expansion while reinforcing its focus on tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), the firm said. The firm's Chief Executive Officer John Patrick Mullin described Dubai as a leader in crypto regulation, noting that the approval is a “crucial step” in the platform’s strategy to bridge decentralized and traditional finance. With the license, MANTRA can offer regulatory-compliant financial products tailored to institutional investors, benefiting from Dubai’s progressive stance on Web3 and digital assets. The company plans to roll out DeFi products designed to meet both regional and international regulatory standards. “Regulatory compliance is fundamental to the trust we build with users,” Mullin said. “This license reflects our long-term vision of driving responsible growth in the digital asset space.” Last month, the platform entered an agreement with United Arab Emirates-based property conglomerate DAMAC Group to bring at least $1 billion of the firm's assets to blockchain rails. In 2024, it added Google as a primary validator and infrastructure for its blockchain and collaborated with the tech giant on an accelerator program for RWAs to encourage more development and innovation.

This forecast for Polygon’s price examines factors such as ecosystem trends, adoption rates, underlying technology, and technical analysis to project the POL price prediction from 2025 to 2031.

Currently, the bulls are defending a drop below the $0.3 level. POL price analysis 1-day chart: Polygon aims for immediate decline POL witnessed a bearish rally after bulls failed to push the altcoin above immediate Fib levels at $0.31. Over the last 24 hours, the price made a solid surge as it broke above crucial Fib lines. However, the Polygon price is now testing the $0.3 resistance line. The 24-hour volume dropped to $14.3 million, showing decreased interest in trading activity. The price is trading at $0.3045, declining over 0.37% in the last 24 hours. POL/USD price chart.

The SMA-14 level suggests upward volatility in the next few hours. POL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bears aim for a hold below EMA trend lines The 4-hour POL price chart suggests POL continues to experience bearish activity around EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. As the price continues to face resistance near the immediate Fib level, bears aim to dominate the chart by holding the price below the EMA20 trend line. POL/USD price chart.

The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the POL price from an immediate surge. However, if POL’s price successfully breaks above $0.3466, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.4229. POL Price Chart If bulls cannot initiate a surge, POL’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.2902, resulting in a correction to $0.2403. Is POL a good investment? POL token can be a good investment option in the long run as the project develops a roadmap for its Polygon 2.0 version. Polygon collaborates with diverse industries to enhance adoption, focusing on NFT solutions and Ethereum scalability. Partnerships include Starbucks for an NFT loyalty program and collaborations with Adidas, Prada, and Disney to develop NFT offerings. Why is POL price down today? Following a sell-off at $0.33, POL’s price failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a break below immediate Fib channels toward $0.3. Will POL Price Recover? If buyers hold the price above the immediate support of $0.3, we might see a strong surge. Will POL price touch $1? Yes, POL price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2025. However, this depends on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will POL Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and POL gains regulatory recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2030. Is POL a good long-term investment? As Polygon continues to expand its offerings, it gains a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, POL can be a good long-term investment option. Recent news/ Opinions on POL Indian telecom leader Jio Platforms released its JioCoin on the Polygon network, expanding its digital services. Starting January 16, Jio integrated JioCoin into its JioSphere browser following a collaboration with Polygon Labs to incorporate Web3 and blockchain technologies. POL price prediction February 2025 Following Donald Trump’s election victory, the crypto market witnessed a robust price surge. As a result, the altcoin market skyrocketed, resulting in a bull run in the Polygon price. However, analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices following a crash recently. We expect POL to record a minimum price of $0.29 and a maximum price of $0.42, with an average of $0.35 in February. POL Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high POL Price Prediction February 2025 $0.29 $0.35 $0.42 POL price prediction 2025 Ethereum fees increase dramatically during a bull market, making it too expensive for regular cryptocurrency users. That’s why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $1.34. It’s anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year.

LTC has risen in the last two consecutive days and is hovering at its highest swing since January 18. It has surged by over 70% from its lowest level this month. Let’s explore why Litecoin is soaring as crypto market liquidations jump to $350 million. Litecoin Price Defying Gravity as Crypto Market Liquidations Jump Litecoin price has largely defied gravity as most cryptocurrencies and the altcoin season index drop. It is up by over 70% from its January lows, while Bitcoin has moved into a technical correction after falling by about 10% from its highest level this year. CoinGlass data shows that crypto market liquidations jumped to $350 million in the last 24 hours as most tokens slipped. The most affected were coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Dogecoin, and XRP. Over 110,000 customers were liquidated, with the biggest victim losing $7.58 million. Crypto Liquidations LTC ETF Approval Odds are Rising The main reason why the LTC price is doing well is that many crypto investors anticipate the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot LTC ETF . Polymarket data places these odds at 84%, up from 42% in January. That is a sign that the agency will approve funds by Canary Capital, Grayscale, and Coinshares. Litecoin ETF Odds The main reason why the SEC may approve the LTC ETFs is that it has already approved spot Bitcoin ETFs . As Eric Balchunas, the senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg noted, as a Bitcoin fork, the SEC views it as a commodity. He said : “ We expect a wave of cryptocurrency ETFs next year, albeit not all at once. First out is likely the BTC + ETH combo ETFs , then prob Litecoin (because it’s fork of BTC = commodity).” LTC Price Technical Analysis: Litecoin Could Blast Off Soon The weekly chart shows that the LTC price is staring at a strong bullish breakout ahead of the ETF approval . It formed a small dragonfly doji candlestick pattern two weeks ago. This doji is recognized by a small body and a long lower shadow, and is a popular bullish reversal sign. This explains why it has risen in the last two consecutive weeks. Litecoin has jumped above $112.86, the horizontal line of the ascending triangle pattern . This pattern is made of a series of higher highs and higher lows and a strong resistance. More gains are usually confirmed when the coin rises above that resistance. The value of LTC has moved above the 50-week moving average, which is supporting the bullish momentum. Therefore, there are signs that the Litecoin price will surge if bulls clear the key resistance point at $146, its highest point in December. Litecoin Price Chart Litecoin Token Privce Targets The most likely scenario is where Litecoin jumps to the 50% Fibonacci Retracement point at $227, up by about 65% above the current level. This view will be confirmed if the coin jumps above $183.6, the 38.2% retracement point. On the flip side, a drop below the lower side of the doji candle at $80 will invalidate the bullish Litecoin forecast .

40539723,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=130675,1739966544,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent EUR/USD Price Analysis: Bullish Momentum Pauses at Critical Test,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/eur-usd-price-analysis-pause/,"Even in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, seasoned traders keep a close watch on traditional financial markets for signals and trends. Currently, the EUR/USD pair is presenting a fascinating scenario. After a robust rally last week, the bulls are taking a pause, and the pair is facing a significant technical test. Is this just a temporary breather, or could it signal a deeper shift in momentum? Let’s dive into the EUR/USD price analysis to uncover the critical levels and technical indicators at play. EUR/USD Price Analysis: Bulls Losing Steam? The EUR/USD pair has experienced a slight pullback on Tuesday, currently trading near 1.0450. This minor dip of 0.32% comes after an impressive rally in the previous week, suggesting that the upward momentum might be waning. While the pair remains above the crucial 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), which generally indicates a constructive outlook, recent price action and key technical indicators are flashing caution signs for bullish traders. Specifically, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has seen a sharp decline to 55. This drop from higher levels suggests a weakening in bullish traction. Concurrently, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram, while still showing green bars, has flattened out. This flatness signals hesitation amongst buyers and reinforces the idea that the previous strong buying pressure is diminishing. Let’s break down these indicators: Key Technical Indicator Readings: Indicator Current Reading Signal Relative Strength Index (RSI) 55 Weakening Bullish Momentum MACD Histogram Flat, Green Bars Buyer Hesitation 20-day SMA Around 1.0450 Current Support Level 100-day SMA Converging around 1.0450 Potential Resistance if crossed The Looming Bearish Crossover: A Critical Juncture One of the most critical technical developments to watch is the convergence of the 20-day and 100-day SMAs around the 1.0450 level. This close proximity raises the specter of a potential bearish crossover . In technical analysis, a bearish crossover occurs when a shorter-term moving average (like the 20-day SMA) crosses below a longer-term moving average (like the 100-day SMA). This event is often interpreted as a signal that downward momentum is gaining strength and that further price declines could be on the horizon. What does a Bearish Crossover mean for EUR/USD? Invalidation of Recent Gains: A confirmed bearish crossover could negate the positive price action seen in the recent rally. Reinforced Downside Bias: It would strengthen the argument for a shift towards a more bearish outlook for the EUR/USD pair. Potential Selling Pressure: Traders often interpret this signal as a reason to increase selling positions or reduce long positions. However, it’s crucial to remember that as long as EUR/USD manages to hold above the 20-day SMA, the bulls still retain a chance to regain control and push prices higher. The next few trading sessions will be pivotal in determining whether this bearish crossover materializes and its subsequent impact. Navigating Key Support Levels in Forex Trading For traders monitoring the forex trading landscape, understanding support levels is paramount. Should the EUR/USD pair fail to hold above the 20-day SMA, it would open the door for further declines. The immediate support levels to watch are: Immediate Support: 1.0420 – This level represents the first line of defense against further selling pressure. A break below this level would confirm increasing bearish sentiment. Deeper Downside Risk: 1.0380 – A sustained move below 1.0420 could expose the pair to a more significant drop towards the 1.0380 level. This would represent a substantial retracement of recent gains and potentially signal a deeper correction. Conversely, if buyers step back in and defend the 20-day SMA, a rebound could target previous resistance levels. However, for now, the focus is on these crucial support levels and the potential for a bearish crossover to unfold. Actionable Insights for EUR/USD Traders Given the current technical picture, here are some actionable insights for forex trading enthusiasts and EUR/USD watchers: Monitor the 1.0450 Level Closely: This level, where the 20-day and 100-day SMAs converge, is the immediate battleground. Watch for a decisive break below this level to confirm bearish momentum. Observe Price Action Around 20-day SMA: Is the price bouncing off the 20-day SMA, or is it struggling to hold above it? Sustained trading below the 20-day SMA increases downside risks. Track RSI and MACD: Further declines in RSI below 50 would strengthen the bearish case. A MACD crossover into negative territory would also add to the bearish signals. Prepare for Potential Downside: If the bearish scenario unfolds, be prepared for potential tests of the 1.0420 and 1.0380 support levels . Consider Risk Management: Always employ appropriate risk management strategies, including stop-loss orders, when trading in volatile markets like Forex. Conclusion: Navigating EUR/USD’s Crossroads The EUR/USD pair is currently at a critical juncture. The pause in the recent bullish rally, coupled with weakening technical indicators and the looming potential for a bearish crossover , suggests that traders should proceed with caution. While the broader outlook remains constructive as long as the pair holds above the 20-day SMA, the immediate risks are tilted to the downside. Monitoring the key support levels and the development of the bearish crossover will be crucial in determining the next move for the EUR/USD pair in the dynamic world of forex trading .

Strategic alt coin investing can help you to optimize your possible gains. With Rexas Finance (RXS) leading the way as the top choice for unheard-of gains, we investigate four of the most significant cryptocurrencies with excellent development prospects in this post. Rexas Finance (RXS) – The Ultimate Crypto For Explosive Gains Rexas Finance (RXS) is the most excellent choice for those seeking life-changing profits with a meager starting-off capital. With its presale already bringing over $45.01 million, this cryptocurrency has generated waves in the crypto scene. Pricing at $0.20, the last stage of its presale, RXS is currently in Stage 12 and has a confirmed launch price of $0.25 on June 19, 2025. Unlike many initiatives that depend on venture capital financing, Rexas Finance has deliberately avoided VC support to ensure that early adopters from the public can profit completely from its explosive growth. RXS is the most profitable among all the rising altcoins since market analysts estimate it will offer an explosive 100,000% increase. Investors can turn their holdings into almost $200,000 post-launch with just a $200 investment at the present presale pricing. RXS’s real-world asset (RWA) tokenization mechanism—which effortlessly lets users own or tokenize assets from anywhere globally—makes it even more appealing. Given growing investor confidence and solid foundations, Rexas Finance is the best choice for anyone seeking large gains in the upcoming bull run. Click Here To Buy Rexas Finance (RXS) Presale Onyxcoin (XCN) – A Web3 Powerhouse with Strong Growth Potential Rising by 1200% year-to-date, onyxcoin (XCN) has shown exceptional success in 2024. At $0.030352 right now, Onyxcoin shows great market activity with a daily trading volume of $257.34 million and a live market capitalization of $934.53 million. Technically, Onyxcoin’s indicators exhibit conflicting signals; the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has neutral readings, but the Moving Averages (MA) reflect otherwise. However, the Stochastic %K and Commodity Channel Index (CCI) suggest a buy potential and that XCN may be underpriced. An investment of merely $200 will yield roughly 6,588 XCN coins. Onyxcoin is a good choice for individuals looking for exponential gains, as its history of price performance and increasing acceptance point to a possible significant price increase. DeXe (DEXE) – A Hidden Gem in the Crypto Market Another cryptocurrency that has been gaining popularity is DeXe (DEXE), which has a current price of $21.56 and a 6.34% growth in the previous 24 hours. With a market value of almost $1.8 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $27.32 million, DEXE has become a significant participant in crypto. Its strong foundations and increasing token acceptance make it a candidate with great explosive potential. With an RSI of 54.12, which indicates that DEXE is still inexpensive and offers a purchasing possibility, technical indicators point to a positive future for the asset. A $200 investment in DeXe would produce roughly 9.26 DEXE coins at the present price. Given its growing popularity and increasing investor interest, DeXe is perfect for those wishing to start modestly and make big gains over the next months. Hyperliquid (HYPE) – The High-Performance Blockchain for DeFi Hyperliquid has attracted traders and investors equally with its entirely on-chain order book perpetual exchange. With a 1.9% growth over the past 24 hours, the token’s present price of $25.42 points to great market momentum. Technically, HYPE’s RSI of 54.12 shows that it is underpriced and could be almost ready for an increase. Investors who spend $200 can get about 7.85 HYPE tokens. As the project becomes more popular inside the DeFi ecosystem, its worth should rise dramatically. Hyperliquid, with its creative technologies and increasing acceptance, is a strong candidate for people looking for explosive returns in the crypto market. Conclusion – Which Crypto Should You Choose for Maximum Gains? Rexas Finance (RXS) stands out among these four choices for investors seeking explosive returns.

These rug pulls have drawn the attention of Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, who has termed the current situation a “hellscape.” SOL price trades at $172 today with a slight 2.5% gain. As the crypto community continues to raise concerns about SOL-based meme coins, how will this impact the price? Solana Founder Calls for Solutions to Meme Coin “Hellscape” In a recent X post, Yakovenko urged developers in the crypto industry to come up with solutions to the problem of meme tokens flooding the market. According to him, this problem has created an opportunity and a ready market for developers. He noted, “Every problem is an opportunity. Solve permissionless fair and fun token launching at scale and you’ll have a ton of customers.” Yakovenko’s remarks follow growing concerns over the losses experienced by traders speculating on the price of these Solana meme coins. An earlier report by Coingape revealed how the Libra meme coin promoted by Argentinian President Javier Milei left nearly 100% of holders in losses . On February 19, 2025, Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports, was also accused of a rug pull after creating a meme token dubbed “Greed”. Portnoy bought 35% of the meme coin’s supply and sold the tokens two hours later in a single transaction, triggering a 99% crash. Lookonchain: X The other popular meme coins launched on Solana include TRUMP and MELANIA, which are down by 77% and 90%, respectively in one month. Due to these losses and the growing concerns, Yakovenko noted that one of the ways out of the current “hellscape” was to solve permissionless token launching. The meme coin frenzy on the blockchain has also coincided with bearish trends for Solana price, which recently dropped below $170 for the first time since November 2024. Bearish Sentiment Pushes Solana Price Below $200 According to Santiment, the market sentiment on Solana dropped significantly after the SOL dipped to a 3-month low on February 18, 2025. While the number of discussions around SOL have increased, most of these discussions are negative and dampening the long-term Solana price forecast . Additionally, a death cross was looming on Solana’s daily chart. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is tipping south, and approaching the 200-day EMA. For now, traders should watch out for a bearish crossover that could accelerate the downtrend. SOL’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) also recently dropped to a multi-month low of 30 indicating an oversold situation. The RSI is recovering and tipping north suggesting that buyers took advantage of the recent dip. The RSI needs to make a higher low to confirm buyer strength. SOL/USDT 1-day Chart If a bullish reversal commences, the immediate resistance lies at the 200-day EMA at $189, with a swing above this level set to resume the uptrend. The market sentiment also needs to flip bullish for Solana price to sustain an upside momentum.

Uniswap’s UNI Token: Governance and Decentralized Trading Uniswap’s UNI token serves as a governance tool, launched in September 2020. It lets holders participate in decisions like fee changes and token distributions. The release aimed to strengthen user loyalty amid rival challenges, giving past users 150 million tokens. Each received 400 UNI, valued at over $1,000 each at launch. Uniswap is an influential decentralized exchange on the Ethereum network, using an automated liquidity protocol. This system allows trading without a central order book, offering users greater control over assets. It stands out from centralized exchanges by providing open accessibility and enhanced security. With over $3 billion in assets, Uniswap is a major player in decentralized finance. Fetch.AI: Bridging AI and Blockchain Technology Fetch.AI, founded in 2017, is an AI-driven platform launched via IEO on Binance in 2019. It develops a decentralized machine learning network with a crypto economy. The aim is to make AI technology accessible to all through a permissionless network. Users can connect and access secure datasets using autonomous AI. Tasks are executed using a global network of data. The platform’s use cases include DeFi trading, smart grids, and travel services. Fetch.AI predictions suggest growth potential in the coming years, with projected price ranges from $0.808541 to $1.024293 by 2025 and $0.601469 to $1.190916 by 2030. This indicates possible gains, suggesting its attractiveness in future markets. Worldcoin: Digital Identity and Financial Inclusion Vision Worldcoin (WLD) is a cryptocurrency established in 2023. It uses eye scans for digital ID verification to enhance financial inclusion and digital identity. This system employs an innovative device called the Orb for iris scanning. The project’s goal is to offer fair access to the global digital economy, supported by a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens. Co-founded by Sam Altman, Worldcoin has gained over two million users. Despite undergoing investigations over privacy concerns, it continues to attract interest due to its potential for widespread use and its vision for a more inclusive digital economic platform that could support Universal Basic Income. Conclusion While UNI, FET, WLD, and VET show potential, their short-term growth may be limited. In contrast, Catzilla emerges as a leading meme coin, aiming to bring financial freedom to all. With a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale and triple utility features, it invites enthusiasts to join the battle against crypto villains and achieve new heights together.

Chainlink (LINK) – Sitting at $19.70, LINK remains a DeFi essential, but new investors are hunting for higher upside potential. Polkadot (DOT) – At $4.50, DOT’s interoperability is valuable, but it hasn’t captured the excitement of this year’s hottest projects.

Why Investors Are Betting Big on MAGACOINOFFICIAL.COM While MATIC, LINK, DOT, and UNI have already had their runs, the real opportunity lies in fresh projects with room for exponential growth.

But despite this bullish outlook, AI development is currently in the hands of a few corporations. A recently published article by the Financial Times indicated that Big Tech companies have lined up over $300 billion to be spent on the AI industry in 2025. Of course, this type of spending was expected given the ongoing AI race between prominent figures like Elon Musk and OpenAI’s Sam Altman as well as on a national level following China’s Deepseek latest strides. The big question, however, is whether these key players, corporations or government authorities are best suited to drive the AI space forward? This question has been a major topic of discussion in recent years as more digital users come to the realization that big tech has been reaping big by monetizing their data while they get the shorter end of the stick – mere entertainment, personalized connections or recommendations on the internet or social media platforms. It is not any different with the current state of AI development. A few players such as OpenAI, Microsoft and Google have emerged as the frontrunners, thanks to their access to already existing large datasets for training. But can we trust these companies to provide a fair ecosystem for all the contributors in AI development? For context, the AI data generation cycle includes several stakeholders; data providers, data generation platforms, AI infrastructure providers and AI model developers. Despite playing an integral role, data providers are the least compensated in this equation, not to mention the hurdles designed to play out against smaller players looking to contribute in the AI space. Decentralizing AI Development Blockchain technology is well-known for its fundamental principles of decentralization, transparency, and immutability. These principles ensure that data is distributed across a network of nodes, making it resistant to tampering and centralized control. Integrating blockchain infrastructures with AI innovations could therefore change the current dynamics where centralized players control the show. To provide a better context, let’s take the example of Fraction AI , this is one of the few protocols that is already leveraging blockchain technology to democratize AI development. At the core, Fraction AI transforms AI data generation into a competitive marketplace, opening up the landscape for more people to participate in the AI space. So, what role does blockchain technology play? Fraction AI introduces a ‘decentralized arena’ that is accessible by anyone, allowing human beings to create AI agents that are capable of competing to generate high quality data; in return, the AI agents earn rewards for their creators. This approach is different from the traditional AI development ecosystem where centralized parties control data access and training hence the multiple instances of biasness and limited innovation. More importantly, Fraction AI has adopted a competitive model whereby AI agents pay a small entry fee to compete in generating the highest quality data. This is how it works; every minute, five AI agents are selected to compete; the agents are given 60 seconds to complete the task after which the outputs are assessed for quality through AI validation. The top performers are then rewarded depending on the quality of their outputs. In doing so, Fraction AI creates a fair playing ground for all stakeholders; builders have the opportunity to earn rewards and receive immediate feedback on the functionality of their AI agents. Meanwhile, the stakers who provide blockchain security earn yields while the AI ecosystem is supported by a continuous stream of high quality training data. This is just one example of blockchain’s potential in the AI industry. It is also worth mentioning that the DeAI space is one of the nascent blockchain niches that has been gaining significant traction; the funding allocated to this ecosystem tripled in 2024, with the latest report from Pitchbook indicating that DeAI startups raised $436 million, a 200% increase from the previous year. Looking Into the Horizon As mentioned in the introduction, the AI development space still has a long way to go both in terms of innovation and the total addressable market (TAM). However, it is important to be careful as we build the next era of innovation, pitfalls that have long plagued the Web2 space ought to be avoided at all costs. This means paying more attention to democratizing the development of AI models, from the data collection process, validation all through to the training phase. So far, blockchain technology is proving to be the only formidable innovation that can be integrated to challenge the status quo. While it may take some time and a significant amount or resources before disrupting the already established dominance, advancements by AI blockchain-powered protocols are a glimpse of what to expect once the two technologies fully converge.

Many have already shifted their focus to Rollblock , an AI-powered gaming and bidding platform that has raised over $10.7 million in its ongoing ICO. With its growing adoption and massive potential, analysts believe Rollblock could be one of the year’s biggest breakout projects. Rollblock (RBLK) Redefines Web3 Gaming with Blockchain Transparency Rollblock (RBLK) is shaking up the $500 billion gaming industry, bringing unmatched transparency and fairness to a sector that has long struggled with manipulation and trust issues. Unlike traditional platforms that operate behind closed doors, Rollblock’s Web3 model ensures every wager is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, making it fully auditable and verifiable. The demand for trustworthy, blockchain-powered gaming solutions is evident in Rollblock’s explosive growth. In December alone, there was a 600% surge in new gamers, with a staggering $1.75 million in wagered bids flowing through the platform. This rapid adoption is no surprise, as Rollblock offers over 7,000 games, a thriving sports prediction market, and a live dealer mode that fosters a highly engaged gaming community. Beyond gaming, Rollblock’s ecosystem is designed to create long-term value for its holders. The platform reinvests up to 30% of its revenue into RBLK buybacks, with 60% of those tokens burned to reduce supply and drive scarcity. The remaining 40% is allocated to staking rewards, offering holders up to 30% APY. With this self-sustaining cycle of buying pressure and staking incentives, demand for RBLK continues to climb. As Stage 10 tokens sell out quickly, RBLK’s price is set to increase again from its current discount of $0.055, positioning it as one of the most promising Web3 projects in 2025. Grayscale’s Spot XRP ETF Acknowledged by SEC, but Analysts Remain Skeptical The SEC recently acknowledged Grayscale's spot XRP ETF filing. However, Bloomberg ETF experts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas think XRP has the lowest chance of approval among the newest crypto ETF proposals. The SEC’s acknowledgment of 19b-4 filings generally signals a willingness to consider an ETF application, but it doesn’t guarantee approval. Seyffart and Balchunas analyzed multiple filings and gave the XRP ETF just a 65% chance of passing—a significantly lower prediction than Litecoin (LTC) at 90%, Dogecoin (DOGE) at 75%, and Solana (SOL) at 70%. At least six companies have submitted applications for an XRP ETF, including Bitwise, Canary Capital, Grayscale Trust, VanEck, 21Shares, and Wisdom Tree. The SEC has until mid-October 2025 to make a final decision, but doubts remain due to Ripple’s ongoing legal battle over whether XRP is a security or commodity. Despite market volatility, XRP remains resilient. Over the past 24 hours, it has dropped over 30%, trading at $2.50. Analysts, however, remain bullish, predicting a rebound to $3 by the end of March and a potential rally to $5 before Q2 2025 concludes. As ETF discussions continue, XRP’s role in shaping the future of crypto regulation is more critical than ever. Rollblock (RBLK) Poised for Explosive Growth as Demand Surges Rollblock is rapidly emerging as a dominant force in Web3 gaming, with its revolutionary ecosystem and 50x upside potential attracting massive investor interest. Unlike traditional platforms, Rollblock’s fully transparent, blockchain-based gaming model ensures fairness and verifiability, making it a top choice for gamers and traders. With demand for RBLK at an all-time high, its current price of $0.055 is a steal for early backers. As adoption expands, another price increase is expected in the coming days, positioning RBLK as a standout performer in the gaming and crypto sectors this cycle.

However, markets demonstrate Solana’s high price volatility, with analysts projecting that SOL will dip to $150 despite currently trading at almost $170. The cryptocurrency market currently experiences high attention toward Solana, while the new blockchain player Panshibi attracts worldwide audience interest. Investors can seize substantial returns through Panshibi’s presale coin status when Solana’s price remains unstable in its upward movement. Solana Price: What’s Next for This Market Leader? Experts sharply disagree on the Solana price trajectory because it might reach its peak again or find equilibrium at a different level. According to market predictions, Solana currently maintains a price of $168.99. Time has proven Solana’s value to be robust due to its efficient blockchain operations and dedicated developer network. Solana’s value decreased by 10% to $164.2, while it decreased by 19% throughout the previous week. The FTX plan to unlock 11.2 million SOL tokens on March 1, 2025, has led to Solana’s current price decline and other market-related factors. Liquidity influx on the network creates a strong downward force on Solana’s price. The Solana market shows worsening sentiment according to decreasing data reported by its on-chain metrics, including active addresses and transfer volume measurements. Fast transaction processing speed and minimal fees at Solana continue to attract investors as the platform deals with its issues. The Solana price experiences significant influences from market sentiment, worldwide economic activities, and other cryptocurrency networks competing in the market, yet its value remains unpredictable. Panshibi: The New Meme Coin Taking the Market by Storm The Solana price fluctuates alongside the cryptocurrency success of Panshibi, which gained rapid popularity in the market. The presale coin attracts extensive market attention because it brings innovative solutions to meme coins. Panshibi gains media praise for its potential to produce substantial profits, while Solana remains stuck below important resistance barriers. Investors are migrating to Panshibi because they view it as a formidable choice to dominate among meme coins and potentially surpass the price value of Solana. Panshibi differentiates itself from common meme coins because it brings staking rewards, NFTs, and DeFi functionality to its platform. Investors who need more than temporary trends find an attractive investment environment through these offerings. Panshibi stands on the path to becoming a prominent force in meme coin markets since expert projections show it will increase 50x in market value before year’s end. How Will Solana’s Price Impact Panshibi’s Rise? The price unpredictability of Solana operates as a driver to escalate interest in Panshibi. The price fluctuations of Solana create opportunities for Panshibi to become an investor destination. Panshibi is a promising alternative to Solana because its high-risk profile appeals to investors seeking adventure in the meme coin space. The ongoing support for the Panshibi coin remains strong, irrespective of Solana’s current market performance difficulties. The pre-sale performance of this cryptocurrency remains outstanding by attracting many investors who seek to benefit from its projected expansion. Panshibi is a promising presale coin choice for 2025 because its $0.005 presale price places it among the leading options while providing alternative fast and rewarding prospects compared to Solana. Final Thoughts on Solana Price and Panshibi The price swings of Solana confuse investors daily, yet Panshibi emerges as an attractive new high-value investment option. The main position of Solana’s price within the altcoin market might remain strong, yet the rapid growth potential of Panshibi creates an interesting alternative. The imminent meme coin season is making Panshibi a presale cryptocurrency, which demands attention because it delivers potential profitable returns despite Solana’s unpredictable price fluctuations. Investors curious about Solana should monitor Panshibi because it shows opportunities for faster profits with better prospective long-term performance. Panshibi continues to attract global attention, which could establish it as the following cryptocurrency success story, which aims to match Solana’s market performance within the next few months.

Polymarket Says 10% Chance After 15 Scams,https://coingape.com/trending/could-dave-portnoy-face-jail-in-2025-polymarket-says-10-chance-after-15-scams/,"Dave Portnoy, the outspoken crypto investor, creator, and founder of Barstool Sports, has been a center of controversy for days now. The reason behind this is his risky financial moves and strategies, where he believes in making a profit, even at the cost of others’ losses. With this mindset and alleged crypto scams, Portnoy might face legal issues because his tactics affected millions of investors. The Polymarket bets on his jail time have surged to 10%, so can he face imprisonment in 2025? Dave Portnoy Alleged In Multiple Crypto Scams The Barstool Sports owner has become the epicenter of crypto scams. It began with Portnoy earning $75k within a day by dumping meme coins. Soon, criticism started following the investor, but instead of apologizing, Portnoy claimed that everyone was there for profit, the same as he had been. I told you what I’m doing. I said I’m going to buy the coins and I’m going to dump them. I’m trying to make money. With his Jailstool endorsement, investors’ sentiments shifted for a while, pumping the token’s price by 119,000%. However, concerns stayed the same, and investor confidence declined with time, leading to the crash. Now, crypto analysts claim that Portnoy has allegedly conducted more than 15 pump-and-dump schemes, increasing the seriousness of the matter. With his influencer status and strong following, critics believed he had pumped certain meme coins before selling his holdings for profits. However, this is just the tip of the iceberg. He has also been reported to have participated in insider trading for LIBRA , which left millions of people under immense losses. More importantly, the LIBRA team compensated him $5M for his losses instead of the victim, which raised community disappointment. Although that discussion has not closed, Portnoy got involved in more controversy, this time with his launched meme coin. I learned how to use a phantom wallet 2 weeks ago. A week later I was the whistleblower in an international crypto scandal. I think my superpower is to always end up in the middle of a shit storm without having any clue how I got there. Good night trenchers. Keep trenching Dave Portnoy Launched GREED Meme Coin & Crased It After the Solana ecosystem faced turbulence, Dave Portnoy launched his own Solana meme coins , beginning with GREED. He encouraged his followers to invest in it, claiming he wasn’t selling it. However, soon, he went over his words, revealing that he only said that for the JAILSTOOL meme coin. He soon dumped $4M worth of GREED tokens but could only make $200,000 due to low liquidity. This caused Dave Portnoy a lot of backlash, but he was unapologetic and pushed this on the holders, saying, “People should invest only what they can afford to lose.” However, despite the criticism, Portnoy launched a second version of GREED and jocked on the people who said meme coins were dead and he was a scammer. In an X post, he said, “ You can’t beat me. Not in this meme coin market. I could launch a Greed 2 collectible coin right now, and it would moon. Nobody has principles. Just greed.” GREED2 is now live in the market, and according to the Lookonchain post, Portnoy holds 26.8% of the supply. Many experts have warned about this crypto coin, but Partnoy claims not to dump his holding until midnight or later, creating buzz around the topic. Is Portnoy Moving Towards Jail Time? Amid this chaos and criticism, the Polymarket odds on Portnoy facing jail increased 28% earlier in the day. However, the odds declined to 10% at press time, but speculation and investors’ anger remained the same. Dave Portnoy is in a tight spot with his market manipulation and pump-and-dump activities. However, since no formal charges have been filed, it is hard to conclude the situation. If considered charges, these could put the influencer in serious legal trouble due to the SEC’s serious take on crypto scams. Regardless, the biggest concern is the impact Portnoy is having on the crypto market. Portnoy has played a significant role in pumping and dumping crypto tokens for his gains. Due to his ability to mass-buy tokens and influence others to do the same, he impacts the performance of various tokens and their holders. Some even lost millions of dollars. If he continues such activities, he might endup in serious legal trouble. Bottom Line Dave Portnoy raises serious ethical concerns. His ability to manipulate the market shows investors blindly follow KoLs and trends and later face the consequences. Over the last two weeks, Portnoy has allegedly run 15 scams and failed to show remorse, increasing the backlash and odds of imprisonment for market manipulation. Investors must be cautious with Portnoy-related or endorsed cryptos and conduct proper research before getting involved. The post Could Dave Portnoy Face Jail in 2025?

Accordingly, blockchain analytics platform Bubblermaps wrote that a trader turned his $1 million investment in TRUMP into $109 million. Bubblemaps claims that a pseudonymous crypto trader “Naseem” made more than $100 million trading Donald Trump’s token, TRUMP memecoin. Bubblemaps noted that the trader received $1.09 million worth of TRUMP using an address starting with “6QSc2,” which he then split across at least nine wallets. Stating that he managed to buy TRUMP at the lowest price, Bubblemaps said that Naseem is not a random investor and has a proven successful track record. ” Naseem is not a random investor, he is an expert sharpshooter with a proven track record. Here are a few examples: “HAWK made $1 Million, LIBRA made $0.5 Million, ENRON made $3.9 Million and SHROOM made $8 Million.” Bubblemaps noted that while their research could not definitively prove that Naseem was ultimately behind the TRUMP trade, circumstantial evidence suggests there are too many connections to ignore. *This is not investment advice.

Pepe (PEPE), as the third largest meme coin, has captivated many with its recent market performance. Despite its significant following, another contender, ChowWow ($CHOW) , is turning heads with its strategic and promising approach, appealing to those looking for both innovation and return on investment. The Rise of Pepe: A Crypto Success Story The narrative of Pepe (PEPE) is a tale of its enduring appeal despite some challenges. While recent indicators like the TD Sequential suggest a potentially bullish phase, a history of descending trends prompts a more cautious optimism. Analysis from Coinglass reveals a notable sell-off, indicating ongoing interest from long-term investors who foresee growth. This sustained interest might propel Pepe's value upward, presenting it as a meme coin with a track record of resilience and potential for future rallies. ChowWow: A Fresh Perspective on Altcoin Dynamics With its roots planted firmly in the Solana blockchain, ChowWow ($CHOW) emerges as a potential disruptor in the meme coin market. The unique attributes of the Solana network, like swift transactions and lower fees, offer ChowWow a competitive edge over its Ethereum-based counterparts. ChowWow integrates a play-to-earn model, encouraging participation through its gaming platform. This structure ensures that active players gain rewards, fostering a loyal community of users who benefit from in-game transactions. Furthermore, the allocation of 10% of tokens for gaming rewards guarantees a stable ecosystem, supporting early adopters and enhancing user confidence. Furthermore, the ChowWow staking platform empowers users to generate income by staking their tokens, which bolsters network security and liquidity. This staking model rewards participants based on their staked amounts and duration, driving long-term commitment and growth. Why ChowWow Could Redefine Meme Coins Unlike Pepe, which rides on its viral appeal, ChowWow's approach is rooted in tangible utility. The intersection of gaming incentives and staking benefits positions ChowWow as a leading choice for those seeking the best investment in meme coins today. As interest swells, ChowWow emerges as a key player poised to reshape the market landscape. For those eager to explore ChowWow's potential, the presale continues at an attractive rate of $0.008 per token, inviting investors to be part of this burgeoning opportunity.

Trump and Democrats lawyer up,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/musk-running-doge-into-chaos-trump-lawyer-up/,"Democrats are not happy with Musk and DOGE’s access to federal data. To that end, they have filed a lawsuit calling the billionaire an “agent of chaos” in the federal government. They say the billionaire has been given virtually unchecked authority without proper legal authorization and supervision of his authority. The Trump administration has said that Musk does not have the power that people think. Both Trump and Musk have said that Musk is responsible for DOGE’s work cutting back on federal agencies. In fact, when Trump spoke about DOGE at a joint press conference last week, he mentioned that Musk is a “successful guy, and that’s why we want him doing this.” However, according to a court filing , Office of Administration Director Joshua Fisher said, “Mr Musk is an employee of the white house office. He holds a position of a non-career special government employee (SGE).” He added, “The US DOGE service is a component of the executive office of the president. The US DOGE service temporary organization is within the US DOGE service. Both are separate from the white house office. He is not an employee of the US DOGE service or the US DOGE service temporary organisation. Mr. Musk is not the US DOGE service administrator.” DOJ lawyers have also said in court that Musk doesn’t have any formal or actual authority to make any government decisions himself. They also noted that there are no examples of Musk being given formal authority to exercise the sovereign power of the United States. Musk has been behind broad cuts throughout the federal government. He has also been vocal about DOGE’s operations on social media. Federal judge declines Democratic attorneys request Judge Tanya Chutkan, a federal judge, declined the request made by Democratic attorneys to temporarily block Elon Musk and his DOGE from accessing federal data. However, the judge also said she didn’t trust what the Trump government said about Musk and his DOGE powers. Democrat lawyers also asked the judge to stop Musk and DOGE from firing or putting workers on involuntary leave. However, the judge said that they had to show that they would suffer immediate, irreversible harm without a temporary restraining order. She added that the state hadn’t done that. Judge Chutkan said, “The court is aware that DOGE’s unpredictable actions have resulted in considerable uncertainty and confusion for Plaintiffs and many of their agencies and residents “It remains ‘uncertain’ when and how the catalog of state programs that Plaintiffs identify will suffer.” The judge also explained that the states’ main case against Musk is strong. However, their claims at this point were not strong enough to meet the standard for the court to take emergency action. She wrote in the filing, “Plaintiffs raise a colorable Appointments Clause claim with serious implications. Musk has not been nominated by the President nor confirmed by the U.S. Senate, as constitutionally required for officers who exercise ‘significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States […] But even a strong merits argument cannot secure a temporary restraining order at this juncture.” The judge, however, warned the defense counsel, saying, “Defense counsel is reminded of their duty to make truthful representations to the court.” Pending lawsuits Other lawsuits are still being processed. They say that the administration broke privacy laws and other rules by letting people connected to the DOGE agency take control of very restricted government IT systems. There are cases that have not yet been challenged in court. Musk and DOGE have certainly been controversial since they started. For example, DOGE employees have reportedly accessed information for Medicare and Medicaid and used AI to search sensitive internal data for the Department of Education . In addition, Trump has made sweeping executive actions, and many of them haven’t been challenged in court yet. For example, he quit the World Health Organization and withheld federal funding from schools that let transgender women play women’s sports. He also put tariffs on China, removed protections around AI, and undid climate change efforts started by Biden. This includes telling federal agencies not to give some money that Congress had approved.

The roadmap supports scalability improvements while maintaining security and decentralization features to enable future growth of GameFi adoption. The rollout of this development brings positive momentum, particularly for the new blockchain GameFi project Rollblock (RBLK) , which bases its operations on Ethereum's transparent and tamper-proof blockchain system. RBLK presents investors with an attractive investment opportunity as it is poised to benefit from Ethereum's continued development. Rollblock Disrupts GameFi with Transparency, Security, and Explosive Growth Rollblock is transforming GameFi through its network of over 7,000 blockchain-based games. The Ethereum-based platform allows users to enjoy live dealer poker, among other traditional games. The blockchain records every outcome, guaranteeing fairness while eliminating the possibility of fraud. The iGaming industry has long struggled with unethical practices. Gaming fraud has surged 60% in the U.S. in recent years, and experts predict this trend will continue into 2025. Rollblock tackles this issue with complete transparency and security. The platform holds a full e-gaming license from the Anjouan Gaming Authority and has successfully passed a SolidProof audit, reinforcing trust among players and investors. This commitment to fairness has fueled rapid growth. In December alone, Rollblock processed $1.75 million in bids and saw deposits and signups increase by 600%. Its presale has also been a massive success, raising over $10.5 million across ten rounds. Rollblock’s rising demand is further supported by its strong presence in GameFi and its deflationary tokenomics. The platform allocates up to 30% of its revenue to buy back RBLK tokens from the open market. Of these, 60% are burned to reduce supply, while 40% are distributed as staking rewards, offering some of the highest APYs in the industry. Currently priced at $0.055, RBLK has outperformed Ethereum, delivering an impressive 450% return for early investors. With growing momentum, Rollblock is set to dominate the GameFi space. Hong Kong’s Crypto Boom and Ethereum’s Struggle—Is Rollblock the Better Bet? Hong Kong has become a world-leading digital finance hub after its crypto adoption levels rose by 85.6% from July 2023 to June 2024. The Hong Kong government sustains its pro-crypto stance through rigorous consumer protection laws and anti-money laundering standards enforced by the Securities and Futures Commission. Hong Kong's acceptance of Ethereum for investment immigration demonstrates its dedication to Web3. However, Ethereum faces ongoing price weaknesses due to ongoing delays in ETF approvals. While the broader crypto market has seen green days, ETH struggles to break past the $2,800 resistance level. Cautious investors are waiting for market signals, leaving ETH stuck at $2,703—a 2.26% weekly surge but still down nearly 18% for the month. Analysts believe Ethereum’s future depends on ETF progress, as institutional interest hinges on regulatory approval. Without a clear decision, ETH’s price could stay in a narrow range, limiting potential short-term growth. With Ethereum facing challenges, traders are turning to high-growth alternatives. Industry experts suggest that projects like Rollblock could thrive in this uncertainty, offering more substantial upside potential. Ethereum ETF Uncertainty Pushes Traders Toward Rollblock’s High-Growth Potential The delay in Ethereum’s ETF approval has created uncertainty, leading traders to explore projects with stronger growth prospects. Analysts see Rollblock as a prime beneficiary of this shift, with its presale quickly approaching $11 million. At just $0.055 per token, Rollblock remains an attractive entry point ahead of its official launch. With momentum building, early investors could secure a major advantage before the platform takes off. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

This initiative promises transparency and security, offering investors a fresh and promising opportunity as they stand on the cusp of Ethereum's revolutionary enhancements. Rollblock: Pioneering a Transparent and Secure Gaming Ecosystem Rollblock has carved out a unique niche by integrating blockchain into traditional gaming formats. Players experience a fair and fraud-free environment thanks to the immutable nature of blockchain. This commitment to integrity is backed by an e-gaming license from the Anjouan Gaming Authority, coupled with an audit by SolidProof, ensuring a high level of trust for its users. The gaming world has long battled with fraudulent activities, a problem Rollblock addresses head-on. By embracing blockchain, this platform is set to redefine ethical gaming, a trend that's seeing widespread adoption globally. The impressive performance of Rollblock is evident in its financial growth. With significant deposits and a surge in user registrations, its presale has surpassed expectations, highlighting its potential to lead the GameFi sector. Navigating the Crypto Waters: Hong Kong's Forward-Thinking Approach and Ethereum's Price Fluctuations While Ethereum has been a staple in the blockchain industry, its price fluctuations have led investors to seek alternatives with higher growth potential. In contrast, Hong Kong's proactive crypto policies are fostering a conducive environment for blockchain innovation, emphasizing the potential for projects like Rollblock. The future of Ethereum heavily relies on the approval of ETFs, a factor causing price stagnation as the crypto market looks for regulatory clarity. However, this has paved the way for emerging projects to capture attention, with Rollblock positioning itself as a compelling choice for forward-thinking investors. Although Ethereum grapples with regulatory delays, Rollblock's promising trajectory suggests it may outperform under current market conditions, offering early adopters a unique growth opportunity. Rollblock's Potential Amidst Ethereum's ETF Delay: A New Path for Investors As the uncertainty surrounding Ethereum's ETF approval persists, traders are turning towards alternatives with robust growth potential. Rollblock stands out in this climate, nearing a significant presale milestone while maintaining an accessible entry price for new investors. With a strategic vision and strong backing, Rollblock is positioned to offer substantial returns, making it an attractive option amid the current crypto landscape. The project's strong market fundamentals and strategic positioning suggest it might be a game-changer for those looking to invest in the burgeoning GameFi space.

Market analysts see this as a major step toward institutional adoption. Meanwhile, Rollblock (RBLK) is capturing attention in February with bold claims of becoming a top altcoin. As its presale nears completion, investors rush in, anticipating massive returns from this rising GameFi and Web3 gaming powerhouse. Rollblock (RBLK) Is Reshaping the $500 Billion Gaming Industry with Blockchain Transparency Rollblock (RBLK is bringing a fresh wave of innovation to the massive $500 billion gaming industry. Unlike traditional platforms, it leverages Web3 technology to ensure complete transparency, eliminating the risks of manipulation and unfair practices. Instead of operating behind closed systems, Rollblock records every bet directly on the Ethereum blockchain. This guarantees fairness, allowing players to verify outcomes and trust the system. The approach has captured market attention and fueled rapid adoption. Interest in Rollblock is skyrocketing. New player registrations surged 600% in December alone, pushing total bids to $1.75 million. The platform’s appeal comes from its vast selection of over 7,000 games and a thriving sports prediction market. Live dealer modes have also become a major attraction, strengthening its growing gaming community. Rollblock reinvests up to 30% of its revenue into RBLK token buybacks to sustain its growth. Of these, 60% are burned to reduce the token supply, while 40% fund staking rewards of up to 30% APY. This strategy increases buying pressure and encourages long-term holding. With Stage 10 tokens selling out fast, RBLK remains discounted at $0.055. As demand rises, another price increase is expected soon, making this a prime opportunity for early investors. XRP ETF Hopes Rise as Institutional Interest Grows U.S. President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto position has intensified hopes for creating an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). However, Ripple faces an ongoing legal dispute with the SEC, a major obstacle to approval. Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas predict the probability of an XRP ETF approval is 65%. Solana has a 70% approval rate, Dogecoin has 75%, and Litecoiin ranks highest with 90%. However, Seyffart predicts that the SEC will fail to authorize an XRP ETF until Ripple resolves its legal disputes. Despite the regulatory uncertainty, major companies Grayscale, WisdomTree, and 21Shares have submitted filings for XRP ETFs to the SEC. Their applications signal strong institutional interest in the token. The SEC is expected to acknowledge filings for both XRP and Dogecoin soon. Commissioner Hester Peirce’s crypto-focused working group could also provide more clarity on the approval process by 2025. Meanwhile, Nasdaq has submitted a request to list CoinShares’ XRP and Litecoin ETFs. If the SEC approves these listings, they could attract new investors and increase the price of XRP. Crypto analyst Edo Farina believes XRP could hit $10 once Ripple’s legal troubles end. The XRP community is watching closely and waiting to see if regulatory barriers will clear or continue to hold back its growth. Rollblock (RBLK) Set for Explosive Growth as Presale Nears Completion Rollblock’s presale is quickly selling out and analysts predict a massive surge in value. They forecast an 880% increase before launch, followed by an extraordinary 100x return once trading begins. This projection positions Rollblock as a top investment for those seeking high returns in the upcoming bull run. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

This major milestone allows Mantra to expand its reach in the UAE and across the MENA region. With this license, they can now operate as a digital asset exchange and offer broker-dealer, management, and investment services. Dubai and UAE Lead the Way with Clear Crypto Regulations Dubai and the UAE are quickly becoming global leaders in the cryptocurrency space, due to their well-structured regulatory frameworks that attract digital asset companies. Mantra CEO John Patrick Mullin praised Dubai and VARA for their forward-thinking approach, as he noted that by creating a comprehensive, ground-up framework for virtual assets and Web3, Dubai and VARA have set the standard in crypto regulation. He also emphasized that securing the VARA license is a crucial milestone for Mantra and a key move in its journey toward global expansion. Mullin highlighted that the UAE and the MENA region have fostered a thriving Web3 ecosystem through clear regulations. With the new license, Mantra could offer decentralized finance products that seamlessly connect DeFi with traditional finance. With its new VARA license, the platform is set to expand its offerings, providing top-tier financial services to institutional clients and qualified investors across the UAE. Mantra to Accelerate RWA Rollout The license will help Mantra speed up the creation of regulatory-compliant financial products to improve its ecosystem. Mullin emphasized that the next phase, focused on “real rollout of RWAs,” will be driven by regulation. He pointed to the surge in Crypto ETF inflows last year, emphasizing that ‘Regulation drives institutional adoption.’ .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Binance Faces Criticism Over Pi Network Listing Vote: Risks & Reactions , Notably, Mantra will initially focus on institutional investors involved in large-scale tokenization projects.

Besides, Mantra is already collaborating with major institutions in the UAE, including Damac, Libre, MAG, Novus Aviation, and Zand, to bring billions in assets onchain. “By the end of this quarter, and into the next, we’ll be sharing updates on new projects we are working on that will tokenize assets across multiple industries, markets and classes,” Mullin added. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Dogecoin is receiving a lot of media attention right now, but a different cryptocurrency in the market shows potential to reach $1 before even DOGE achieves it. Let us do a deep dive into Dogecoin price predictions and market performance and see why Remittix (RTX) has what it takes to beat Dogecoin in this race to $1. Dogecoin Price Prediction; Can Dogecoin Ride The Current ETF Hype Dogecoin stands as the top meme coin and holds the position of the largest meme coin based on market capitalization. The price movements of Dogecoin result from both social media popularity trends and endorsements from celebrity figures like Elon Musk. The current market value of Dogecoin stands at $37 billion while its trading price sits at $0.25. Perhaps the most important news swaying experts Dogecoin price predictions is increased optimism after Grayscale received formal approval from the SEC for their XRP and DOGE ETF applications. The SEC's standard procedure of acknowledging applications indicates potential changes in their stance toward alternative cryptocurrency ETFs. Chair Gary Gensler previously denied all such applications during his tenure. The SEC's recent approval shows potential changes in regulatory policies under Trump's administration as they promised to relax crypto regulations. Dogecoin enthusiasts discuss payment system integration extensively yet these discussions remain purely speculative at this time. The quick price gains forecasted by Dogecoin price predictions remain uncertain because of its meme-based foundation. Remittix (RTX) Is Emerging As The Hero of PayFi So, why's everyone buzzing about Remittix (RTX)? Remittix is sticking to the basic and most accessible needs of individuals and businesses. Remittix is not diving into the deep end of AI or the nitty-gritty of tokenizing your old vinyl collection; instead, it's tackling a giant headache: those ridiculous wire transfer fees that waste people’s hard-earned cash. Picture this: a teacher in the Philippines, teaching German kids online, or a construction worker in Dubai, sending his pay home. With Remittix (RTX), the money moves in a flash from wallet to cash, no bank fees hanging around like unwanted guests. For a lot of individuals, Remittix (RTX) isn't just another crypto project; it's a lifeline. Who doesn't want to save on sending money abroad? And it's not just talk; Remittix (RTX) has got the numbers to back it up. The Remittix presale is doing incredibly well and has already generated more than $12.3 million and sold a whopping 465 million tokens with prices currently at $0.0628 in this presale Stage. Experts are saying that if this momentum keeps up, especially with potential partnerships for kiosks or mobile wallets, Remittix (RTX) might sprint past the more niche projects. Unlike those focused on meme, AI or asset tokenization, Remittix (RTX) has a PayFi approach that's as broad as the ocean, appealing to anyone from gig workers to globe travellers. Remittix's (RTX) whole setup screams inclusivity. It's about making money transfer easy, secure and without the usual wait times or costs. Plus, they support over 100 cryptocurrencies, making it a go-to for anyone juggling digital and fiat currencies. This kind of versatility, paired with straightforward, low fees, makes Remittix (RTX) more than just another speculative play; it's a real-world solution. With its clear mission, solid funding, and a real-world problem to solve, Remittix (RTX) isn't just another crypto; it's the tool that could make sending money overseas as easy as a text message. While everyone's watching Dogecoin's rollercoaster ride, keep an eye on Remittix(RTX).

40542320,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=699533,1739971734,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/40542320.jpeg,Best ERC-20 Altcoins to Buy as Ether Reserves Record Historical All-Time Lows,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/best-erc-20-altcoins-to-buy-as-ether-reserves-record-historical-all-time-lows/,"Ether supply on exchanges is now at a 9-year low: specifically 18.95 million ETH as of February 18, at the time of writing. This suggests investors are now moving $ETH into cold storage, presumably for long-term HODLing purposes. If the ecosystem is overall looking to hold, rather than trade Ether, the historic all-time lows supply significantly increases the odds of ‘supply shock’ occurring, which would inevitably power an $ETH bull run and skyrocket the price. Basic economics dictate that a supply shock happens when the demand of an asset exceeds the supply, creating a significant gap. This ultimately results in an increase in price. $ETH has not been able to sustain the $4K mark so far, trading in the range of $4.1K to $2.2K since the last year. However, analysts believe this supply shock could just be what it needs. Add to this the possibility of $ETH staking, which could tighten supply and boost investor confidence in Ethereum as a long-term investment. The BTC and ETH Trains Wait for Nobody Nicolai Sondergaard, a crypto analyst, said that something similar is happening with Bitcoin too. $BTC reserves are now at a 3-year low with only 3.5M $BTC left with exchanges. Swelling demands and a shift towards long-term holdings are big positives for the crypto industry. According to Dr. Jan Wüstenfeld , there’s also less new capital entering the space, and record numbers of tokens being created. This suggests a significant battle for liquidity, perhaps even a dry out in the short term. Of course, it makes sense to be more risk-averse when you’re not sure about the best way forward, even the most degens of crypto degens know that! If you want a piece of the upcoming frenzy, this might just be the right time for fresh investments, and with stablecoins rearing for another bull run, altcoins will almost certainly follow suit. Here are some of the best ERC-20 altcoins that can benefit from surging $ETH and $BTC prices. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best ERC-20 Altcoin to Benefit from $BTC’s Growth BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) doesn’t just reduce the cost of investing in Bitcoin, but also exponentially increases the amount of money you stand to make if and when $BTC catapults to new highs. As the only crypto on the market to give out free $BTC to token holders, BTC Bull will see significant price appreciation alongside Bitcoin’s growth. Is it the next 100x meme coin? Quite possibly, yes. How does it work? If you’re a $BTCBULL holder and you’ve stored the tokens in Best Wallet, you’ll automatically receive $BTC airdrops when Bitcoin reaches the $150K, $200K, and $250K marks. Pretty neat. What’s more, seeing as 40% of the total token supply will be used for PR and marketing, it’s safe to say that BTC Bull will continue being a top trending crypto even months and years after its launch. Investors flocked to BTC Bull as soon as it launched. Barely into its second week, this project has already amassed a whopping $2.3M. Each token is currently available at $0.00237, but this won’t be the case for long as the price is slated to increase very soon. It’s worth noting that although BTC Bull is a Bitcoin-themed altcoin through and through, it’s built on the ERC-20 network to simplify cross-chain transfers and interoperability. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – First-Ever Layer 2 Solution on Solana Solana attracts a lot of meme coin developers thanks to the network’s low transaction fees and ability to rapidly create and trade these cryptos. However, it looks like Solana didn’t take into account just how popular it would get. It’s now struggling with network congestion, frequently failed transactions, and limited scalability. Solaxy ($SOLX) aims to build the first-ever Layer 2 blockchain for Solana. By leveraging Ethereum’s vast liquidity and Solana’s unmatched efficiency, Solaxy will offer lightning-fast transactions, faster throughputs, and even lower transaction costs on Solana. A value proposition if we’ve ever seen one. A meme coin with real utility (and therefore massive growth potential ), it’s hardly a surprise that Solaxy has gone on to become one of the best crypto presales ever. With over $22M in presale funding, $SOLX is still ridiculously cheap: just $0.00164 per token. If this is your first presale purchase, here’s how to buy $SOLX . 3. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best AI Agent Crypto Offering Crypto Trading Calls If you find it difficult to make consistent profits in crypto, you’re certainly not alone. These are tough markets, after all. What if you could leverage cutting-edge AI technology for your crypto investments? That’s exactly what MIND of Pepe ($MIND) does. $MIND is a revolutionary AI agent that interacts with the crypto community online (on dApps and platforms like X), wraps his ‘mind’ around all the hype and varying opinions on thousands of cryptos, and uses hive-mind analysis to narrow down on only the very best cryptos to invest in. All you have to do to receive these early-stage investment calls (as well as tons of other exclusive perks) is be a $MIND holder, a fantastic nod to and reward for the chads who never sell, who always ask ‘what’s an exit strategy?’ You can do so at the lowest possible cost if you invest in the $MIND presale , which is ongoing and has already raised over $6M. 1 $MIND is currently available for just $0.0033587. If you don’t know where to start, here’s how to buy it. 4. Shiba Inu ($SHIB) – Still a Prominent Dog Meme Coin We’ve all seen the explosive debut of FirstBroccoli, a dog-themed meme coin inspired by Binance’s CZ’s very own pet dog. With pet meme coins back in the game (not that they ever left), Shiba Inu ($SHIB), the biggest pet meme coin on ERC-20, is in a pole position to benefit from all the hype. Few dogs can match its cuteness, what can you do. $SHIB has generated sizable gains (+57%) for investors in the last year. Although its price hasn’t really gone anywhere recently, that could just as well be a positive sign indicating that a breakout may be around the corner. Also, Shiba Inu’s exchange netflow has been negative in the last month. This signals at a potential shift from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods. Another bullish signal. $SHIB is currently trading at $0.00001543. ERC Altcoins Are Here to Stay These are hands down the best ERC-20 altcoins to buy and HODL in 2025, at the time of writing. However, that’s not to say that they’re risk-free investments. The crypto market, after all, is full of ups and downs, and you can always lose everything you invest. Liquidity drying up is a concrete sign crypto investors found investments they’re happy with for now and are willing to hold on for a little longer before making any moves. Whether Bitcoin, Ether, or an ERC-20 altcoin, demand outpacing supply is a sign of growing prices. Still, we urge you to do your own research, as none of the above is a substitute for financial advice from a certified professional.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|SHIB|ALTCOIN|ETH,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-02-19 13:28:54

The approval now allows the entity to serve as a Virtual Asset Exchange and provide Broker-Dealer and Management and Investment Services. MANTRA’s Milestone According to a document shared with CryptoPotato , the VARA license reinforces MANTRA’s commitment to compliance, security, and innovation in the virtual asset space. It also reaffirms the entity’s global expansion and strengthens its presence in the Middle East. Commenting on the initiative was the platform’s CEO, John Patrick Mullin: “By establishing the most timely, comprehensive, and built from-the-ground-up framework for virtual assets and Web3, Dubai and VARA have become world leaders in crypto regulation. This license was a crucial step for MANTRA and a key step in our journey towards global expansion.” He also claimed that the UAE has become “a progressive global hub and thriving ecosystem for Web3 and virtual assets” due to its comprehensive regulatory framework. This license not only strengthens our presence regionally , it positions us internationally to deliver unique DeFi products that bridge the gap between decentralized finance and traditional finance. Our goal is to build a future-focused financial ecosystem that benefits institutional and qualified investors globally,” Mullin added. Meanwhile, MANTRA plans to launch various unique DeFi products designed to meet investors’ needs. Each offering is developed with strict adherence to domestic regulations and international policy frameworks, ensuring maximum protection for users. OM’s Price Rally Speaking of MANTRA, we should mention the solid performance of its native token, OM. Its price is up a whopping 3,000% on a yearly scale , recently hitting an all-time high of almost $7.90. OM Price, Source: CoinGecko Some market observers believe the asset may chart a further increase in the near future . The X user BullifyX, for instance, envisioned a rise above $8. On the other hand, Ali Martinez assumed OM could be headed for a pullback, citing the formation of a sell signal on the 3-day chart.

Namely, almost the whole crypto market is still very volatile. Solana (SOL) is no exception. That’s because it has been losing momentum for days. So, Solana investors are losing confidence. Meanwhile, FXGuys ($FXG) investors are gaining more confidence every day. Namely, thanks to FXGuys’ new and improved trading approach, it has the potential to be the market’s next 50x play. Because of this, this new crypto trading platform presents a much better investment than SOL! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Solana Is Losing Steam: Where Will This Go? Solana, the 5th largest crypto coin , is growing weaker. It all started with the recent market crash. Namely, during it, the SOL price dropped to $180. After that, it managed to bounce back a bit. However, now it’s falling again. Because of this, Solana investors are losing confidence. This means that many are selling their Solana coins as we speak. So, now, the SOL price is close to its recent low, currently at $190 . SOL’s failure to stay above $200 is causing even more bearish sentiment in the community. This is further fueled by Solana’s decreased trading volume. Namely, memecoin trading on Solana has slowed down a lot. So, people aren’t using SOL as much as they did. Considering all of these factors, experts say that the SOL price will continue to fall. They say that SOL’s price will reach its low again soon. And if the SOL price doesn’t start increasing then, it can fall below $180 in a few weeks.

Ethereum’s gas fees remain a big concern despite improvements like proto dank sharding and Layer 2 rollups. This is why users are seeking alternatives that offer affordability and efficiency. Meanwhile, Cutoshi is a meme token that redefines decentralized trading with its cross-chain capabilities and affordable swaps. Ethereum’s Gas Fee Challenges Ethereum’s high gas fees have long been a pain point for users. While the network’s move to proof-of-stake (PoS) in 2022 reduced energy consumption massively, it didn’t directly address gas costs. In 2025, Ethereum’s gas fees remain volatile, spiking during periods of high demand, such as NFT drops or DeFi protocol launches. For instance, during peak times, fees can further exceed for complex transactions, making microtransactions and small trades economically unviable. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism have taken away some pressure, handling over 60% of Ethereum transactions. However, these solutions still rely on Ethereum’s mainnet for finality, leaving users exposed to occasional fee spikes. This has created a growing demand for truly decentralized, cheap alternatives. This is a gap Cutoshi is perfectly positioned to fill. Cutoshi’s Multi-Chain DEX Cutoshi’s DEX was created to overcome the limitations of the traditional players. The platform integrates swaps on different blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and many others, getting rid of expensive cross-chain bridges. Credits: Cutoshi (X) Cutoshi’s DEX is remarkably less expensive than Ethereum’s main net, thus making it economical for retail investors as their flat fee of 0.25% per trade is so attractive. The DEX is also focused on privacy and safety. Their non-custodial trading is based on Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision of decentralized trading systems. Also, Cutoshi’s DEX is not like centralized exchanges that require the connection of a wallet for trading, leaving the users in control of their assets. Moreover, to encourage more users to use their platform, Cutoshi’s DEX offers liquidity providers a whopping 80% of trading fees. Reasons For Cutoshi’s Presale Success Cutoshi’s value creation does not stop at the DEX. It is a deflationary meme coin with a limited supply, which preserves scarcity and increases value in the long term. In addition to that, Cutoshi’s MemeFi ecosystem offers NFTs rewards to the community and an educational DeFi platform that completely goes against the typical notion of meme coins. Conclusion While Ethereum remains a stable bet in your portfolio, tokens like Cutoshi can give multifold returns. With Cutoshi’s focus on affordability, privacy, and community-driven growth, it is poised to become a key player in the decentralized trading space. $CUTO tokens can currently be bought on their website in their presale. The good part is that till Feb 19, you get a 35% bonus on all deposits.

This shift has led to increased interest in innovations like Cutoshi's multi-chain decentralized exchange, which promises not only to cut costs but also to enhance the user experience. Understanding the Gas Fee Dilemma Users of the Ethereum network have faced consistently high gas fees, often fluctuating dramatically during peak times, such as significant NFT releases or when new DeFi protocols come online. Despite Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake model aimed at reducing energy usage, it hasn't significantly curbed these costs. Reports of high gas fees continue to deter transactions, particularly smaller ones that become economically unfeasible under such conditions. Layer 2 solutions, while alleviating some pressure from Ethereum’s main network, still inherently depend on it, which exposes them to sporadic fee spikes. This environment has accelerated the demand for decentralized and cost-efficient alternatives—a gap that Cutoshi is poised to fill. The Promise of Cutoshi's Multi-Chain DEX Enter Cutoshi’s decentralized exchange, tailored to solve the very issues plaguing Ethereum’s network by enabling cross-chain swaps across various blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and others without incurring hefty bridge fees. The platform's flat trading fee of 0.25% makes it particularly appealing to retail investors. In addition, Cutoshi’s commitment to privacy through non-custodial trading systems ensures users maintain control over their assets, reminiscent of Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision. Liquidity providers on Cutoshi’s platform enjoy a generous share of the trading fees, receiving 80%, which further incentivizes participation. The Appeal and Impact of Cutoshi’s Presale Cutoshi is not just a DEX but also a deflationary meme coin, designed with a limited supply to maintain scarcity and potential value appreciation. Cutoshi's ecosystem, focusing on MemeFi , integrates NFT rewards and a comprehensive DeFi educational platform, redefining what a meme coin can offer. A New Frontier in Decentralized Trading For investors seeking diversification, Cutoshi presents an intriguing option with its focus on cost-effectiveness, privacy, and community engagement. It positions itself as a transformative player in the decentralized trading arena, offering significant potential returns. The opportunity to invest in $CUTO tokens is available through their ongoing presale, with a limited-time offer providing a 35% bonus on deposits until February 19.

First-time homebuyers hit historic lows as Bitcoin exchange reserves shrink",https://crypto.news/home-sales-slow-bitcoin-demand-surges/,"U.S. household debt just hit $18T, mortgage rates are brutal, and Bitcoin’s supply crunch is intensifying. Is the old path to wealth breaking down? Table of Contents Real estate is slowing — fast From scarcity hedge to liquidity trap Too many homes, too few coins The flippening isn’t coming — it’s here Real estate is slowing — fast For years, real estate has been one of the most dependable ways to build wealth. Home values generally rise over time, and property ownership has long been considered a safe investment. But right now, the housing market is showing signs of a slowdown unlike anything seen in years. Homes are sitting on the market longer. Sellers are cutting prices. Buyers are struggling with high mortgage rates. According to recent data, the average home is now selling for 1.8% below asking price — the biggest discount in nearly two years. Meanwhile, the time it takes to sell a typical home has stretched to 56 days, marking the longest wait in five years. BREAKING: The average US home is now selling for 1.8% less than its asking price, the largest discount in 2 years. This is also one of the lowest readings since 2019. It current takes an average of ~56 days for the typical home to sell, the longest span in 5 years.… pic.twitter.com/DhULLgTPoL — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) February 17, 2025 In Florida, the slowdown is even more pronounced. In cities like Miami and Fort Lauderdale, over 60% of listings have remained unsold for more than two months. Some homes in the state are selling for as much as 5% below their listed price — the steepest discount in the country. At the same time, Bitcoin ( BTC ) is becoming an increasingly attractive alternative for investors seeking a scarce, valuable asset. BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news BTC recently hit an all-time high of $109,114 before pulling back to $95,850 as of Feb. 19. Even with the dip, BTC is still up over 83% in the past year, driven by surging institutional demand. So, as real estate becomes harder to sell and more expensive to own, could Bitcoin emerge as the ultimate store of value? Let’s find out. From scarcity hedge to liquidity trap The housing market is experiencing a sharp slowdown, weighed down by high mortgage rates, inflated home prices, and declining liquidity. The average 30-year mortgage rate remains high at 6.96%, a stark contrast to the 3%–5% rates common before the pandemic. U.S. mortgages rates | Source: Mortgage News Daily Meanwhile, the median U.S. home-sale price has risen 4% year-over-year, but this increase hasn’t translated into a stronger market—affordability pressures have kept demand subdued. Several key trends highlight this shift: The median time for a home to go under contract has jumped to 34 days, a sharp increase from previous years, signaling a cooling market. A full 54.6% of homes are now selling below their list price, a level not seen in years, while just 26.5% are selling above. Sellers are increasingly forced to adjust their expectations as buyers gain more leverage. The median sale-to-list price ratio has fallen to 0.990, reflecting stronger buyer negotiations and a decline in seller power. Not all homes, however, are affected equally. Properties in prime locations and move-in-ready condition continue to attract buyers, while those in less desirable areas or requiring renovations are facing steep discounts. But with borrowing costs surging, the housing market has become far less liquid. Many potential sellers are unwilling to part with their low fixed-rate mortgages, while buyers struggle with higher monthly payments. This lack of liquidity is a fundamental weakness. Unlike Bitcoin, which can be traded 24/7 with near-instant execution, real estate transactions are slow, expensive, and often take months to finalize. As economic uncertainty lingers and capital seeks more efficient stores of value, the barriers to entry and sluggish liquidity of real estate are becoming major disadvantages. Too many homes, too few coins While the housing market struggles with rising inventory and weakening liquidity, Bitcoin is experiencing the opposite — a supply squeeze that is fueling institutional demand. Unlike real estate, which is influenced by debt cycles, market conditions, and ongoing development that expands supply, Bitcoin’s total supply is permanently capped at 21 million. Bitcoin’s absolute scarcity is now colliding with surging demand, particularly from institutional investors, strengthening Bitcoin’s role as a long-term store of value. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 triggered a massive wave of institutional inflows, dramatically shifting the supply-demand balance. Since their launch, these ETFs have attracted over $40 billion in net inflows, with financial giants like BlackRock , Grayscale , and Fidelity controlling the majority of holdings. The demand surge has absorbed Bitcoin at an unprecedented rate, with daily ETF purchases ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 BTC — far exceeding the roughly 500 new coins mined each day. This growing supply deficit is making Bitcoin increasingly scarce in the open market. Bitcoin new supply | Source: CryptoQuant At the same time, Bitcoin exchange reserves have dropped to 2.5 million BTC, the lowest level in three years. More investors are withdrawing their holdings from exchanges, signaling strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential rather than treating it as a short-term trade. Bitcoin exchange reserve balance | Source: CryptoQuant Further reinforcing this trend, long-term holders continue to dominate supply. As of December 2023, 71% of all Bitcoin had remained untouched for over a year, highlighting deep investor commitment. Bitcoin 1+ year HODLER data | Source: Bitcoin Magazine Pro While this figure has slightly declined to 62% as of Feb. 18, the broader trend points to Bitcoin becoming an increasingly tightly held asset over time. The flippening isn’t coming — it’s here As of January 2025, the median U.S. home-sale price stands at $350,667, with mortgage rates hovering near 7%. This combination has pushed monthly mortgage payments to record highs, making homeownership increasingly unattainable for younger generations. To put this into perspective: A 20% down payment on a median-priced home now exceeds $70,000—a figure that, in many cities, surpasses the total home price of previous decades. First-time homebuyers now represent just 24% of total buyers, a historic low compared to the long-term average of 40%–50%. Total U.S. household debt has surged to $18.04 trillion, with mortgage balances accounting for 70% of the total—reflecting the growing financial burden of homeownership. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has outperformed real estate over the past decade, boasting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 102.36% since 2011—compared to housing’s 5.5% CAGR over the same period. But beyond returns, a deeper generational shift is unfolding. Millennials and Gen Z, raised in a digital-first world, see traditional financial systems as slow, rigid, and outdated. The idea of owning a decentralized, borderless asset like Bitcoin is far more appealing than being tied to a 30-year mortgage with unpredictable property taxes, insurance costs, and maintenance expenses. Surveys suggest that younger investors increasingly prioritize financial flexibility and mobility over homeownership. Many prefer renting and keeping their assets liquid rather than committing to the illiquidity of real estate. Bitcoin’s portability, round-the-clock trading, and resistance to censorship align perfectly with this mindset. Does this mean real estate is becoming obsolete? Not entirely. It remains a hedge against inflation and a valuable asset in high-demand areas. But the inefficiencies of the housing market — combined with Bitcoin’s growing institutional acceptance — are reshaping investment preferences. For the first time in history, a digital asset is competing directly with physical real estate as a long-term store of value. The question is no longer whether Bitcoin is an alternative to real estate — it’s how quickly investors will adjust to this new reality.",Feature|Bitcoin|Inflation|real estate,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-02-19 13:32:56

Private credit was the most rapidly tokenized asset, showing that a whole industry is turning to crypto for liquidity. Tokenized RWA recently crossed the $20B milestone, a growth that has come courtesy of private credit. RWA tokenization is among one of the strongest narratives, surviving even the recent market drawdown. Based on various metrics, RWA tokenization, excluding stablecoins has surpassed $20B. Over $11.9B is tied into tokenized private debt, which has the largest share of all asset classes. The complete data on tokenization is fragmented, as token issuers use different chains and not all tokenized assets are trading in the same way. Private credit is the largest and fastest-growing sector for tokenized assets. More crypto startups are seeking access to private credit from reliable businesses. | Source: RWA.xyz RWA tokenization is also unregulated, with each platform deciding on its own format and approach. Tokenized assets range from highly tradable stablecoins backed by government securities to specialized token-based funds only available for accredited investors. According to Moody’s, private credit is one of the fastest-growing sources of liquidity, with $1.7T in assets under management and about $500B in assets waiting to be deployed. The current value captured by crypto companies is only a small fraction and is almost experimental in its valuation. Private credit offers opportunities to middle-market companies and privately owned enterprises. Moody’s predicts private credit will expand to $3T AUM by 2028, becoming one of the biggest sources of financing. RWA companies offer tools to raise liquidity The recent expansion of the RWA narrative led to the creation of additional infrastructure. DigiFT announced its partnership with Ivesco USA to launch a platform for tokenized senior secured loans with daily liquidity. DigiFT will offer its tokenized products to accredited investors. The platform’s main task would be to partner with reliable companies that issue private debt and offer access to businesses with strong fundamentals. DigiFT will tokenize a small fraction of Ivesco’s portfolio, following the fund’s overall strategy of searching for reliable businesses. On the side of purely crypto startups, the Kadena ecosystem also aims to tap the growing trend for tokenized securities. Kadena is offering a grant program for projects building new RWA infrastructure. 🚀 Kadena announces a $25M RWA Grant Program to accelerate the adoption of Real World Assets 🌎.

Srinivasan predicts a return to the token sale era, but this time backed by already developed companies.

Equity deals through the crypto markets may boost adoption and use cases, reviving the market for assets with intrinsic value. RWA narrative tokens stage a recovery Tokens bearing the RWA label recently staged a recovery, with leading assets going against the market direction. RWA tokens are valued at only $37B in total market capitalization, though they remain one of the most robust classes of crypto. As meme tokens see an outflow of enthusiasm, RWA is one of the first sectors to have a revival. Mantra (OM) had the biggest weekly rally, appreciating by over 29% to $7.56. Maker (MKR) also rallied to $1,189.90, as the DeFi hub is one of the biggest users of tokenized bonds used as collateral. RWAs have continued to outperform other narratives in the past 30 days, retaining their lead in all sectors. However, not all tokens are guaranteed to outperform, and altcoins are still relatively weaker. There is still no consensus on the most usable type of tokenization. Older platforms and altcoin projects are trying to revive their fortunes by adopting some form of RWA . The tokenized assets themselves also have a relatively low turnover and are often used for treasuries and unmovable vaults.

It’s also easy to appreciate if you’re familiar with its consensus mechanism, scarcity, and supply schedule. Of late, though, the world’s best-known digital asset is making waves in another area – DeFi. Once viewed as digital gold and the ultimate inflation safe haven, BTC’s increasing adoption in DeFi is now one of the hottest narratives in the industry. Indeed, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols has been on a steady march since last October. So, which factors can we credit with the bounce? And why does it matter? Bitcoin’s DeFi Boom It’s fair to say Bitcoin had a momentous 2024. Not only did it smash through its previous ceiling and post a new all-time high (ATH) price, but it experienced a halving event, saw huge interest from institutional investors thanks to spot ETF launches, and it was even praised by a leading Presidential candidate – who went on to win the election. This momentum continued into the new year, with Bitcoin’s price hitting a new ATH of $109,350 on January 20th. Perhaps more consequential than the price, though, is the coin’s attractiveness to the movers and shakers in decentralized finance, be they traders, lenders, borrowers, or stakers. This phenomenon has even birthed its own term: BTCFi. Incredibly, the total value of Bitcoin locked in DeFi rose more than 2,000% in 2024, from just $307 million in January to around $6.5 billion by December 31. As mentioned, the temperature of investor interest has risen sharply since October and at the time of writing, despite recent market choppiness, $6.8 billion is locked in BTFi. Clearly, Bitcoin’s unrivalled security and deep liquidity make it an ideal foundation for DeFi protocols, many of whom have benefitted from the emergence of scaling solutions like Lightning Network and exSat which enable faster and more scalable transactions to occur. The arrival of these platforms is no surprise given the depth of dormant liquidity held by bitcoiners, a community that has, until recently, been unable to capitalize on the myriad DeFi opportunities available using their favorite cryptocurrency. In hindsight, it was always a matter of time before solutions came online enabling the use of BTC in decentralized finance. exSat, described as the Docking Layer for Bitcoin scalability, is a particularly interesting example of a BTCFi project, in that it employs a hybrid consensus mechanism (Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake) to import Bitcoin blocks in a decentralized fashion. In so doing, exSat supports the extension of Bitcoin’s utility and enables the development of intuitive Bitcoin-based dApps like DEXs and lending protocols. Late last year, exSat rolled out Credit Staking to unlock new earning opportunities for bitcoiners while bolstering ecosystem security. With Credit Staking, users can validate BTC blocks within exSat’s network, sign the consensus, and earn rewards in the process. One of the leading Bitcoin restaking protocols, it now boasts $692m in TVL. By providing secure and transparent yield opportunities for hardcore bitcoiners, exSat’s Credit Staking replicates the success of Ethereum-based DeFi protocols that grew in popularity from 2019 onwards. Interestingly, Credit Staking relies on the use of a native exSat bridge, developed with the aid of Ceffu, ChainUp, Cobo, and Cactus Custody, which lets users retain ownership of their underlying BTC while participating in staking. Early Days for BTCFi Although Bitcoin’s DeFi TVL still lags behind the likes of Ethereum and Tron, it is on an undeniable upward trajectory. The blue-riband cryptocurrency’s transition from a static safe haven asset to a dynamic DeFi player is just beginning, with innovations like those mentioned above paving the way for broader adoption and lucrative market opportunities. Although the future of Bitcoin DeFi is bright, to borrow a popular phrase: we are still early. Particularly if Galaxy Digital’s prediction proves to be correct; last year, it said that 2.3% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply could be bridged into BTCFi by 2030 – around $47 billion. DeFi-curious bitcoiners, then, would do well to make sure they’re aware of the opportunities currently at their disposal.",Information,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-19 13:40:50

The coming up of its trading engine is aimed at enhancing the existing trading of Bitcoin assets including BRC-20 and Ordinals Trading. As revealed by UniSat Wallet via a X post today, Hexa is combining the efficiency of centralized exchanges (CEX) with the security and transparency of decentralized finance (DeFi), in order to provide its users with a seamless and robust trading experience. To enhance performance, UniSat has integrated Hexa with Fractal Bitcoin, an advanced layer designed to increase Bitcoin’s block space and reduce transaction confirmation times. This helps in increasing the block space by 20x, allowing more transactions per block. It further reduces confirmation time to 30 seconds, making Bitcoin trading significantly faster. What exactly is UniSat’s Hexa? Hexa is a next-generation hybrid trading engine that aims to enable efficient and secure trading of Bitcoin-native assets, including: BRC-20 tokens – A fungible token standard on Bitcoin. Ordinals and Bitcoin NFTs – Unique digital collectibles inscribed directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. Runes and Taproot Assets – The latest token standards that optimize Bitcoin’s scalability and functionality. Native Stablecoins – Stable digital currencies built within the Bitcoin ecosystem. UniSat’s Hexa introduces a high-speed, transparent, and verifiable trading system that ensures smooth transactions without compromising security. Unlike traditional centralized exchanges that require users to give up custody of their assets, Hexa allows traders to retain full control while benefiting from fast trade execution and liquidity. Introducing UniSat Hexa: The next-gen hybrid trading engine reimagining Bitcoin assets. We're starting small, but dreaming big. 1/ HEXA brings you the best of both worlds: CEX-like unified and seamless trading experience DEX-style self-custody natively from your wallet pic.twitter.com/xV53QDZvdU — UniSat – wallet, explorer & extension for bitcoin. (@unisat_wallet) February 19, 2025 Key Features of Hexa As a hybrid trading model, Hexa can bridge the gap between centralized and decentralized trading as it incorporates the best features of both models. It maintains an off-chain order book for efficient trade matching while ensuring that all transactions are settled on-chain, providing verifiability and security. Every trade executed through Hexa is recorded on-chain, ensuring full transparency and preventing manipulation. Unlike traditional CEX platforms, where users rely on the exchange’s internal records, Hexa allows traders to independently verify all transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. Hexa is designed to support a wide range of Bitcoin-based assets, enabling users to trade not only BRC-20 tokens but also new token standards such as Runes and Taproot Assets. This broad support positions UniSat as a leader in Bitcoin-native asset trading. One of the biggest challenges in crypto trading has been balancing security with usability. Hexa can eliminate the need for users to deposit their funds into an exchange, reducing the risk of hacks and mismanagement. Instead, trades are executed in a non-custodial environment, allowing users to retain full control of their private keys. Can Hexa be a Game Changer for Bitcoin Asset Trading? Bitcoin has traditionally been seen as a store of value rather than an ecosystem for DeFi and tokenization. However, with the rise of Ordinals, BRC-20 tokens, and Bitcoin NFTs, a new financial ecosystem is emerging on Bitcoin. The newly launched UniSat’s Hexa addresses the need for a scalable and efficient trading platform tailored specifically for these assets. By integrating Fractal Bitcoin’s enhanced infrastructure, Hexa can make trading on Bitcoin more efficient and accessible, potentially driving increased adoption of Bitcoin-native assets. Nonetheless, UniSat’s launch of Hexa marks a major milestone for the Bitcoin trading ecosystem. By combining the best elements of centralized and decentralized exchanges, Hexa offers traders a fast, secure, and transparent way to engage with Bitcoin-native assets. As interest in Bitcoin’s DeFi potential continues to grow, UniSat’s innovative approach could set the stage for the next evolution of digital asset trading.

The launch of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund marks the first Luxembourg-domiciled fund investing in U.S. government securities that's fully tokenized, the asset manager claimed in a press release. This means shares in the fund are recorded and transferred on the blockchain rather than through traditional processes, using Franklin Templeton's proprietary blockchain-based transfer agency platform for handling transactions to offer enhanced efficiency, transparency and security. The fund is available on the Stellar Lumens network (XLM) for institutional investors in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, following regulatory approval in October by Luxembourg regulators. The U.S.-registered version of the fund has attracted over $580 million of assets since its 2021 debut and is limited to U.S.-based investors only, per rwa.xyz data . Tokenized U.S. Treasuries have been at the forefront of red-hot real-world asset tokenization efforts, growing into a $4 billion asset class this year.

The Swedish company is launching a satellite with Spire Global, which operates a low-orbit satellite constellation. The satellite will be carried by SpaceX’s Transporter-13 mission in late February from Vandenburg Space Force Base in California. Discussing the launch during Consensus Hong Kong, Robin Wingardh, Wingbits' CEO and co-founder, said the satellite complements the startup’s 2,200-strong on-the-ground node network managed by flight enthusiasts around the world. The decentralized physical infrastructure network, or DePIN, project rewards data providers with Solana testnet tokens. The existing flight-tracking industry also relies on flight enthusiasts to supply data on airplane movements. Companies such as FlightAware and Flightradar24 sell data to aviation analytics companies, airlines, insurers and others, but don’t reward the enthusiasts for their work, Wingardh said. Wingbits already has data contributors from over 90 countries tracking some 120,000 unique flights daily. It plans to create a worldwide network through the reward system, which allows tokens to be exchanged for air miles, airport lounge access and other services. Wingardh said the satellite, when launched, will allow the company to verify data from the ground, providing protection against “spoofing” by cross checking flight data from the DePIN against data from the satellite, Wingbits hopes to ensure its information is more accurate than its competitors’.

Critical factors at this point include Trump’s change in tariffs and rising inflation concerns. Singapore-based cryptocurrency platform QCP Capital said tariff and inflation concerns are escalating and remain the most pressing issues for investors. However, analysts stated that the markets have priced in these concerns and that the markets are moving slowly, which puts pressure on investors. Analysts also noted that other factors continue to weigh on cryptocurrencies, citing Solana’s March 1 unlock of 30M tokens as an example. Analysts stated that the Solana (SOL) unlocking also put Bitcoin and Ethereum under pressure, and said that despite the negative catalysts, Bitcoin continued to remain resilient at the $95,000 level after falling to $93,000. At this point, analysts added that Bitcoin and altcoins are actually ready to rise, but they are having difficulty going higher due to the lack of catalysts in the short term. “Cryptocurrencies remain under pressure, with Solana set to unlock 30 million tokens on March 1.

The final order of forfeiture issued on Tuesday by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York formally severed Bankman-Fried's ownership stake in a property list dozens of pages long. The court document revealed the wide swath of assets the one-time billionaire claimed ownership in, including extensive crypto holdings of Alameda Research , the trading firm SBF co-founded. From the many pages of cryptocurrencies, Alameda's assets at Binance included $56 million in Ripple-connected token ( XRP ), $3.6 million of Tron's ( TRX ), $3.4 million of Cardano ( ADA ), $2.3 million in bitcoin ( BTC ) and dozens of others, according to the accounting. The weightiest holding detailed among the assets were the proceeds from the sale of Robinhood stock — $606 million held by Bankman-Fried's Emergent Fidelity Technologies . Other financial assets included: $119 million in Tether (USDT) held at Binance for Alameda Research $21 million at Marex held for Emergent Fidelity Technologies $50 million at Moonstone Bank for FTX Digital Markets $101 million at Silvergate for FTX Digital Markets $7 million at Flagstar Bank for SBF and another individual The accounting of forfeited assets also included two private jets: a 2009 Bombardier Global 5000 and a 2006 Embraer Legacy . The court document also detailed an extensive list of more than 250 political donations that had been pulled back from the campaigns and the organizations that received them, including amounts that other FTX executives allegedly gave under SBF's direction. At one point, one in three members of Congress during the last session were recipients of money from Bankman-Fried or other FTX executives, and they gave to an extensive array of state political organizations, too. Also on Tuesday, the first payouts began in the bankruptcy of FTX, with $1.2 billion going out to those who were owed relatively small amounts. They were set to recover about 119% of what they'd initially had in their accounts during the 2022 collapse, missing out on the huge upswing in crypto markets since then.",Policy|SDNY|Federal Court|FTX Collapse|Sam Bankman-Fried|SBF|Robinhood Markets Inc.,EN,0,0,MARKET|ADA|BNB|BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-19 14:00:00
33767162,[object Object],1739973615,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Musk’s DOGE Investigates SEC—Will It Impact The Ripple Lawsuit?,https://bitcoinist.com/musks-doge-investigates-sec-will-it-impact-the-ripple-lawsuit/,"The Elon Musk-led US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has set its eyes on conducting an in-depth investigation on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as part of the agency’s target to cut government wastage of funds. Some analysts speculated that the DOGE’s scrutiny of the regulatory body could impact the lawsuit faced by crypto firm Ripple, which might end up with SEC withdrawing the case against the firm. Probe On SEC The official DOGE-SEC account on X announced that the government efficiency department would initiate an investigation against the SEC , seeking public assistance in reporting possible wrongdoing of the regulatory body. “DOGE is seeking help from the public! Please DM this account with insights on finding and fixing waste, fraud and abuse relating to the Securities and Exchange Commission,” DOGE_SEC said in a post. The post received a great deal of attention from the public, encouraging people to report any SEC-related misconduct that they know. As of writing, the post has gained more than 8,000 replies. Drop The Cases Vs Crypto Players Consequently, many members of the cryptocurrency community are urging the SEC to drop, pause, or review the various lawsuits charged against several crypto players like Coinbase, Binance, Ripple, and Helium. Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase, even suggested that the regulatory body should shoulder the legal costs and fees of defendants if the SEC lost a lawsuit. Some analysts said this demand from Grewal is understandable, considering the many years of legal back-and-forth between the crypto exchange and the SEC. Moreover, many members of the crypto community are urging the SEC to dismiss the case filed against Richard Heart, founder of PulseChain, Hex (HEX), and PulseX (PSLX). Some individuals are pushing to conduct a probe on how the SEC handled the ETH Gate controversy and the case against Ripple, accusing the former SEC head Gary Gensler of political favoritism in his decisions. Ripple Case Seen To End Many members of the crypto community believe that the lawsuit could be dropped in the upcoming months with a new SEC head and the DOGE_SEC probe. The SEC under the Trump administration vowed to take a different approach toward regulating digital assets. In addition, SEC cases against Binance, Coinbase, and Lejilex might end up with a favorable ruling or possibly be dropped as Mark Uyeda has been appointed as Acting Chair while Commissioner Hester Peirce will lead the Crypto Task Force. Analysts believe that the Crypto Task Force will also have a vital role in resolving non-fraud-related crypto cases. Several legal experts suggested that the SEC will move away from its current aggressive enforcement actions against digital assets once Paul Atkins is confirmed as the new SEC Chair.

The articles discussed Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s claims that the company has seen increased hiring and business opportunities in the US since Trump’s election victory in November. The articles, originally published by Coindesk and The Block in early January, reported that 75% of Ripple’s current job openings are now US-based. CEO Brad Garlinghouse had also shared the info through a post on X, calling the new administration’s change of heart towards crypto the “Trump effect.” Trump’s posts on Truth Social garnered over 10,000 likes and 400 replies, with XRP enthusiasts saying the US President has “angered” Bitcoin maxis for publicly supporting Ripple’s cause. Supporters predict a good year for Ripple Before the November US elections, Ripple Labs and Donald Trump’s relationship was nothing more than shaky; the latter was a known donor of over $10 million to the presidential campaign of Trump’s competitor, former Vice President Kamala Harris. As reported by Cryptopolitan, some unverified sources say Ripple executives spent months asking to meet the president at his residence in Mar-a-Lago to mend the relationship. Moreover, per an Axios exclusive, a source familiar with the matter claims President Trump hauled some words at Brad and his team during their January 8 “closed meeting.” “When I needed you, where the f**k were you? You weren’t with me, and maybe you were with her,” referring to Harris, whom he defeated, “You guys made this amount of money last year, and you’re gonna make so much more now because of me.” Some crypto community members speculated that during that meeting, Trump and the executives verbally agreed to push Ripple, RLUSD, and XRP as the top choices for digital currency services in America. Despite the buzz surrounding Trump’s endorsement, XRP’s price remained largely unchanged, trading at $2.57, per Coingecko data. However, trading volume saw a sharp 2% increase over the past 24 hours, reaching $5 billion. Ripple vs. SEC may soon come to an end Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s founded Department of Government Efficiency announced on Monday that it will be auditing the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the coming days. The regulatory agency has been at the center of a high-profile legal battle with Ripple that started in December 2020 over allegations that XRP was sold as an unregistered security. The company insists that its operations in the US were largely hindered by the SEC’s lawsuit , and are hoping Trump’s administration will help throw out the case before the year ends. In July 2023, US District Judge Analisa Torres gave Ripple a partial “sigh of relief,” ruling that the company’s retail XRP sales did not violate any security laws but did say the token was offered to institutions as securities. The SEC, under former Chair Gary Gensler, appealed parts of the ruling, seeking a more definitive win against Ripple and causing the case to drag on to date. Some industry observers speculate that the SEC, now under interim pro-crypto leader Mark Uyeda, could withdraw its appeal or reach a financial settlement to finally end the legal battle. Rising hopes for an XRP ETF approval On Tuesday, expectations for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) went up after the SEC formally acknowledged another filing made by Cboe BZX to list 21Shares’ XRP ETF. The regulatory agency also acknowledged filings from the New York Stock Exchange for Grayscale and Bitwise, who had submitted an application for an XRP ETF in early October. While these acknowledgments do not guarantee eventual approval, they are seen as positive steps toward bringing XRP into the ETF market. SEC has now begun the 240-day mandated review timeline for these investment vehicles, expected to end in October 2025. Decentralized betting platform Polymarket now places the odds of an XRP ETF approval in 2025 at nearly 78%, up from the 64% seen about a month ago.

40543265,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=699514,1739973652,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Dogecoin Price Consolidates In Symmetrical Expanding Triangle, What’s Next For DOGE?",https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/doge/dogecoin-in-symmetrical-triangle/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is once again making waves in the crypto market. This time, it’s due to a fascinating technical pattern forming on its price chart: a symmetrical expanding triangle. Known for signaling periods of heightened volatility and potential breakout opportunities, this pattern has traders and investors on the edge of their seats, wondering what’s next for DOGE. The symmetrical expanding triangle is a rare and dynamic formation, marked by its widening price range and converging trendlines. For Dogecoin, this pattern reflects a tug-of-war between bulls and bears, with neither side gaining a clear upper hand yet. As the triangle continues to develop, the likelihood of a decisive price movement grows, setting the stage for an explosive breakout or breakdown. Analyzing Dogecoin’s Current Price Action Within The Expanding Triangle Dogecoin’s price action within the symmetrical expanding triangle suggests heightened market indecision as both bulls and bears attempt to assert dominance. The widening nature of the triangle indicates increasing volatility, with each price swing becoming more extreme. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Stuck In Limbo—What’s Holding Back The Recovery? Currently, DOGE is oscillating between the upper resistance trendline and the lower support trendline of the expanding triangle. Each swing is becoming more pronounced, with a higher high of $0.2923 and a lower low of $0.2403, reflecting increasing market uncertainty and aggressive trading activity. These key support and resistance trendlines will determine the next major move. If buyers push the price toward the upper boundary, a breakout could signal a bullish continuation. Conversely, a drop toward the lower trendline hints at a possible bearish breakdown. Volume trends and technical indicators like RSI will provide further confirmation of market sentiment as DOGE approaches a decisive move. A rising RSI toward the 50% threshold may indicate a strengthening upside momentum, whereas a continued downward move might reinforce the bearish outlook. Furthermore, an uptick in volume alongside a price surge would support a sustained rally while declining volume leads to weakening conviction among market participants. Key Levels To Watch For A Confirmed Breakout As DOGE continues to trade within a symmetrical expanding triangle, identifying key levels for a confirmed breakout is crucial for traders and investors. When a bullish or bearish breakout occurs, it could signal the start of a new trend, making it essential to monitor these levels closely. Related Reading: Dogecoin Rally To $0.35 Could Trigger Massive Short Squeeze Specifically, a strong close above the upper boundary of the pattern near $0.2923, coupled with a notable surge in trading volume, would confirm an upward breakout. This move will probably pave the way for further growth, driving the price toward $0.3563 or beyond. However, If DOGE fails to hold support near $0.2403, selling pressure could intensify, pushing the price down to $0.1800 or lower. A sustained bearish move below this level points to a deeper correction, bringing historical support zones into focus.

40543435,https://coingape.com/?post_type=markets&p=239832,1739973979,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"4 Ethereum Coins That Could Explode If ETH Price Hits $4,000",https://coingape.com/markets/4-ethereum-coins-that-could-explode-if-eth-price-hits-4000/,"The crypto market remains on edge, with ETH price comfortably below $3,000. However, Ethereum has formed an ascending triangle pattern and its exchange balances are falling, pointing to an eventual rebound. Here are the top Ethereum coins that may explode higher if it jumps to $4,000. Best Ethereum Coins that Could Surge if it Hits $4,000 ETH price has numerous catalysts. Its ETF inflows are rising, exchange balances have crumbled, it has formed an ascending triangle, and a giant megaphone pattern . These bullish catalysts may push its price higher soon, benefiting many Ethereum coins like Pepe (PEPE), AAVE (AAVE), Uniswap (UNI), and Ethereum Classic (ETC). Ethereum coins Price Chart Pepe (PEPE) An Ethereum price surge to $4,000 will benefit some of the biggest meme coins in its ecosystem. Pepe price may surge because of its popularity and the fact that it has formed a falling wedge pattern. This pattern comprises two descending and converging trendlines and often leads to a strong bullish breakout when they near their confluence. Pepe may surge to its all-time high of $0.00002828, up by almost 200% from the current level. Pepe Price Ethereum Classic (ETC) Ethereum Classic is one of the top Ethereum coins that may explode higher if ETH price surges to $4,000. One potential catalyst is that one or more firms will seek approval of a spot ETC ETF. Such approval would likely pass because it is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency. Ethereum Classic price is also in a three-year consolidation, which is a sign that it is going through an accumulation. It recently dropped to the lower side of the ascending channel, meaning that a strong rebound may happen soon. A move to the upper side of the channel at $40 would be an 86% surge. Also, a climb to the 50% retracement at $93 would be a 340% rally. Ethereum Classic Price AAVE (AAVE) AAVE is one of the biggest Ethereum coins that could explode higher if ETH price soars to $4,000. It is the second-largest player in the DeFi ecosystem with about $20 billion in assets. AAVE has strong technicals as it is forming a cup and handle pattern whose upper side is at $700. The lower side of the rounded bottom pattern has already been completed. There are signs that AAVE price is in the second phase of the Elliot Wave pattern, which is usually followed by the third one, which is often the longest. A rebound to the YTD high of $400 would be a 55% surge, while a rally to its all-time high of $705 would be a 175% rally. AAVE Price Uniswap (UNI) Uniswap is one of the best Ethereum coins to buy if the value of ETH rebounds. It has some of the best fundamentals in Ethereum because it is the biggest DEX network, handling billions of dollars in volume a day. The coin also remains above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since July 2022. A rebound to the December high would be a 100% rally. Uniswap price Summary on Top ETH Coins Many blue-chip ETH coins have struggled in the past few months as focus has been on Solana meme coins . Technicals and fundamentals point to more ETH price surge later this year, which will benefit many tokens in the ecosystem. The others to benefit are Shiba Inu, Chainlink, Mantra, and Ondo.

N1 , an ultra-fast, low-latency Layer 1 blockchain for futuristic crypto apps, has confirmed the commitment of its original investors in preparation for its mainnet launch in the coming months. The commitment involved several top crypto venture capital firms and angel investors, including Multicoin Capital and Arthur Hayes. The investors, who capital funded the predecessor of N1 – the now defunct 01 –aim to push forward the development and growth of the platform as the mainnet launch draws closer. N1 was founded by Founders Fund, a VC firm backed by Peter Thiel, aiming to develop a Layer1 that enables the development of new generation decentralized applications (DApps), solving the scalability challenges that its parent blockchain, Ethereum, faces. The new agreement with the original investors will see N1 revise their cap table to include them and support the launch of the Layer 1 blockchain designed to serve as a full-stack ecosystem for high-throughput DApps. Additionally, N1 also eliminates the trade-offs between on-chain and off-chain development, allowing every app to operate in its own isolated environment, resulting in zero state congestion. The blockchain provides developers with unrestricted scale and ultra-low latency, which supports the development of next-generation applications. Notwithstanding, N1 features horizontal scalability, sub-ms latency, and ultra-high throughput. Finally, it supports mainstream programming languages like TypeScript, with Python and more coming soon, making it significantly easier for developers to build sophisticated applications that can scale without compromise. The Switch From 01 Layer 2 to N1 Blockchain In December 2024, 01, a high-performance Ethereum Layer 2 solution, was shut down in favour of the N1 Layer 1 blockchain, as the team aimed to provide users with a futuristic platform to build next-gen apps. The founders drew upon everything they had learned while building 01 to develop N1. N1 offers drastically different utilities and capabilities to on-chain developers, as well as post-Ethereum smart contract chains. With the goal to supercharge DApp development, N1 will support all code on-chain, allowing developers to deploy apps using the programming language they are familiar with. This makes blockchain development feel no different from traditional software development, removing the friction that has historically slowed adoption. N1 blockchain also offers distinct settlement and execution layers with enhanced efficiency as well as a consensus-less design that achieves quorum without compromising security. As stated before, this allows DApps deployed on the blockchain to have their individual dedicated environment, enabling them to utilize their own language and scale vertically. New Features Unvieled on N1 Blockchain As the long-awaited mainnet launch draws closer, N1 also unveiled several new features on the platform, including the NTS, NordVM, NX, and N1 Studios. NTS is a Typescript smart contracts application development environment that offers a powerful, feature-rich, and extremely developer-friendly environment for all developers. NTS is currently available to a select group of early-access developers. These testers are already building applications that previously would have been impossible on-chain, pushing the boundaries of what can be done in a fully decentralized environment. The NordVM, also available to early access developers, is a Rust-based exchange-specific framework designed to make on-chain order books as performant and feature-rich as centralized exchanges. The NX, a virtual machine (VM) Agnostic framework, allows developers to build apps in any language (from Python to C to Rust) and with any VM. The NX will be released later during the testnet. Finally, N1 has also launched N1 Studios, a product studio dedicated to incubating and supporting the next generation of on-chain applications. The N1 Studios already boasts a couple of applications to kickstart the ecosystem on the blockchain, mostly built by the founders. In addition to helping developers launch DApps, N1 Studios will also focus on funding, mentoring, and launching high-impact applications that demonstrate the full potential of an unrestricted execution environment. This is expected to solve several bottlenecks in blockchain development, including constraints around compute, speed, latency and programming language compatibility. The studio aims to simplify the development of blockchain apps while ensuring the growth of groundbreaking applications in the future, a team statement from N1 reads.

Today, traditional Forex markets are sending ripples that can indirectly influence crypto sentiment. Let’s dive into the key movements in the Forex arena, focusing on how Pound Sterling and the Aussie Dollar are reacting to fresh economic data and central bank decisions. Understanding these shifts provides valuable context for crypto traders assessing broader market risk and potential capital flows. Forex Today: Decoding the Currency Market Moves The Forex Today landscape is painted with cautious optimism and strategic central bank actions. As investors hunt for the next market catalyst, Tuesday’s trading session is witnessing choppy movements across major currencies. Keep an eye on the European economic calendar, particularly the February ZEW Survey – Economic Sentiment for Germany and the Eurozone. Later today, Canada’s January Consumer Price Index (CPI) data will be a key indicator to watch. The US bond market’s reopening after a long weekend saw the 10-year Treasury yield climb above 4.5%, bolstering the US Dollar. Consequently, the USD Index is showing modest gains near 107.00. Several Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to speak later in the day, which could further influence the dollar’s trajectory. US Dollar Performance This Week Here’s a snapshot of the US Dollar’s performance against major currencies this week: USD EUR GBP JPY CAD AUD NZD CHF USD 0.26% -0.23% -0.18% 0.07% -0.11% 0.16% 0.06% EUR -0.26% -0.34% -0.48% -0.10% -0.29% -0.00% -0.10% GBP 0.23% 0.34% -0.06% 0.25% 0.11% 0.34% 0.24% JPY 0.18% 0.48% 0.06% 0.25% 0.11% 0.55% 0.22% CAD -0.07% 0.10% -0.25% -0.25% -0.16% 0.09% -0.01% AUD 0.11% 0.29% -0.11% -0.11% 0.16% 0.28% 0.19% NZD -0.16% 0.00% -0.34% -0.55% -0.09% -0.28% -0.10% CHF -0.06% 0.10% -0.24% -0.22% 0.00% -0.19% 0.10% Heat map of percentage changes of major currencies against each other. RBA Rate Cut: A Surprise Move in Currency Markets In a move that sent shockwaves through the currency markets , the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has decided to cut its policy rate by 25 basis points, bringing it down to 4.1% from 4.35%. This decision aligns with market expectations, but the implications are significant. Key takeaways from the RBA rate cut announcement: Inflation Concerns: The RBA expressed concerns that disinflation could stall, and inflation might remain above the target range if policy easing occurs too rapidly. Cautious Outlook: Governor Michele Bullock indicated in the post-meeting press conference that further rate cuts, as priced in by the market, are not guaranteed. Market Reaction: Interestingly, AUD/USD showed minimal immediate reaction, trading flat around 0.6350. This muted response could suggest that the rate cut was already largely anticipated by the market. Pound Sterling Finds Support in Positive Jobs Data Across the globe, the Pound Sterling is showing resilience, finding support from encouraging jobs data out of the UK. The Office for National Statistics reported that the ILO Unemployment Rate remained steady at 4.4% for the three months to December, beating market forecasts of 4.5%. Positive highlights from the UK jobs report: Stable Unemployment: The unemployment rate holding steady is a positive sign for the UK economy. Employment Growth: The Employment Change figure surged to 107,000, significantly up from the previous month’s 35,000, indicating a robust labor market. GBP/USD Reaction: Following the data release, GBP/USD edged slightly higher, trading just above 1.2600, demonstrating the positive sentiment surrounding the Pound. Other Currency Movements to Watch While the Pound and Aussie Dollar are in focus, other currency pairs are also exhibiting interesting dynamics: USD/CAD Consolidation: After a nearly 0.8% drop last week, USD/CAD is currently consolidating below 1.4200. The upcoming CPI data from Canada will be crucial in determining its next direction. EUR/USD Bearish Pressure: EUR/USD remains under slight bearish pressure but is holding above 1.0450. Market participants are awaiting the German ZEW survey for further cues. Gold’s Steady Climb: Gold continues to attract investors, trading positively above $2,900 after gains on Monday, indicating ongoing safe-haven demand. Central Banks and Monetary Policy: Key Concepts Explained Understanding central bank actions is crucial for navigating currency markets . Let’s clarify some frequently asked questions about central banks: What is the core mandate of a central bank? Central banks are primarily tasked with maintaining price stability within an economy. This involves managing inflation and deflation to ensure a stable economic environment. Major central banks like the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of England (BoE) typically aim to keep inflation around 2%. How do central banks manage inflation? The primary tool central banks use is adjusting the benchmark policy rate, also known as the interest rate. By raising or lowering interest rates, central banks can influence borrowing costs, thereby impacting economic activity and inflation. Monetary Policy Actions: Monetary Tightening (Hiking Rates): Used to combat inflation by making borrowing more expensive, slowing down economic activity. Monetary Easing (Cutting Rates): Used to stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper, encouraging investment and spending. Who shapes monetary policy decisions? Central banks are generally designed to be politically independent. Policy decisions are made by a board of members, often after rigorous vetting processes. These board members can be broadly categorized as: Doves: Favor looser monetary policy, low interest rates to boost economic growth, even if it means slightly higher inflation. Hawks: Prefer tighter monetary policy, higher interest rates to control inflation aggressively, prioritizing price stability. What role does the central bank head play? The chairman or president of a central bank leads policy meetings, fosters consensus among board members with differing views (hawks and doves), and can cast the deciding vote in case of a tie. They also communicate the central bank’s monetary policy stance and outlook through speeches and public appearances. To avoid market disruption, central bank members observe a ‘blackout period’ before policy meetings, during which they refrain from public comments to prevent market speculation. In conclusion, Forex Today highlights the intricate dance between economic data releases, central bank actions, and currency market movements. The RBA rate cut and positive UK jobs data are key events shaping the current trading landscape. For crypto investors, keeping abreast of these Forex dynamics provides a broader understanding of global market sentiment and potential risk-on/risk-off shifts that can influence digital asset markets.

This avant-garde Layer 1 blockchain aims to revolutionize the way decentralized applications (DApps) are developed and deployed. With support from initial backers like Multicoin Capital and crypto investor Arthur Hayes, N1 is poised for its impending mainnet unveiling, marking a pivotal moment in its development journey. Founded with the vision to overcome the limitations faced by its predecessor, the 01 Layer 2 solution on Ethereum, N1 has captured the interest of the investment community, including Founders Fund led by Peter Thiel. The firm's intent is to facilitate a new era of scalable DApps through a comprehensive ecosystem. This evolution is predicated on lessons learned from the 01 project, ultimately giving birth to a blockchain solution designed to address persistent scalability and congestion issues. From Conceptual Insights to Innovative Execution Transitioning from 01 to N1, a deliberate pivot in December 2024, enabled the founders to implement a cutting-edge approach to on-chain development. By adopting a Layer 1 architecture, they could craft a high-performance environment for application developers, drastically enhancing the overall efficiency of the blockchain infrastructure. N1's strategy involves creating a balanced interplay between on-chain and off-chain development, ensuring zero congestion and enabling each application to function independently.

With a new friendly SEC, the big money is about to flood in. If you're searching for the best altcoins that can send your portfolio into orbit, you’re in the right place. Let’s open Pandora’s dirty 1000x box and see what’s inside! Top 10 altcoins that could shatter reality this year We cut through the noise, dodged the scams, and chased down the coins that actually have a shot at the moon, locked and loaded for absurd growth this year. Here’s what made the cut: Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) iDEGEN (IDGN) Solana (SOL) Ethereum (ETH) Dogecoin (DOGE) Sui (SUI) Ripple (XRP) Cardano (ADA) Tron (TRX) Chainlink (LINK) Bitcoin Pepe For too long, BTC has been the boomer in the room: powerful, respected, but kind of boring. The biggest problem with Bitcoin is its aging infrastructure. Retail users want speed, they want fun, they want degenerate 1000x gains and Bitcoin Pepe’s BPEP is handing it to them on a silver platter. It’s the perfect onboarding tool to bring the next billion users into BTC, all while creating a new source of life-changing speculation. By creating the PEP-20 standard, Bitcoin Pepe cracks open a meme coin Pandora’s box right on Bitcoin’s trillion-dollar network. This is a full-scale invasion of Bitcoin’s dormant liquidity. That means anyone can now launch meme coins on Bitcoin, backed by its insane security and deep liquidity. Solana’s meme season sent a dozen garbage-tier projects to billion-dollar valuations. If you could have bought SOL before its meme coin economy explosion, wouldn’t you have? This is that opportunity, just on the biggest chain of them all. To learn more and to buy Bitcoin Pepe, check out the Official Website . iDEGEN Most AI cryptos come wrapped in the same tired promises: smarter automation, better efficiency, some vague talk about revolutionizing finance, but iDEGEN has crawled straight out of Pandora’s dirty box with no respect for regulation, ethics, and whatever passes for AI safety these days. With three bans on crypto X, every suspension fueled the hype, every attempt to silence it made it even more unstoppable, raising over $23.5m. Instead of fizzling out, it became the first AI agent to plant its flag in RedNote, opening the floodgates to 500 million users in Asia, and it’s now set to corrupt an entirely new audience. iDEGEN is about to go to war against China’s DeepSeek, a model that’s cutting AI costs to the bone and opening up new markets in Asia. The battle between Western crypto chaos and Eastern AI efficiency is about to be front-page news, and iDEGEN is in the thick of it. An AI arms race, but instead of world governments, it’s degen traders picking sides. Hype that never dies. Attention that never fades. An AI-driven project so reckless and unpredictable that it’s practically destined for a 1000x. And with its official launch on 27th February, the countdown has already begun. Visit the iDEGEN website to learn more. Solana Meme coins made Solana hot, but now institutions are loading up, and that’s what truly matters. With $1.6 trillion asset giant Franklin Templeton launching a fund on Solana, this blockchain is becoming a Wall Street favorite. In Q3 2024 alone, institutional investments in Solana-based DeFi soared 54%, totaling $173 million . The same big-money players who once shunned Solana are now staking their claim, knowing that its ultra-fast transactions and low fees make it the perfect on-chain trading hub. The mix of retail degenerates and institutional whales is the perfect recipe for a supply shock. Ethereum The ETH dev meeting on Feb. 13 saw Ethereum’s top minds agreeing on faster, more aggressive upgrades. The Pectra and Fusaka updates are coming in hot, streamlining Ethereum into an unstoppable force. Meanwhile, institutions are foaming at the mouth for exposure. The SEC just greenlit a combined BTC-ETH ETF proposal, and $655M in fresh institutional cash flooded Ethereum ETFs in a blink. If the final approval goes through, Ethereum could easily moon. Dogecoin Dogecoin has been through every kind of market storm, and every single time, it shrugs, winks, and pumps anyway. It is the only meme coin with deep market penetration, decade-long survival, and real-world brand power. Now, ETF speculation is starting to swirl. Institutions love assets with massive retail appeal and DOGE has it in spades. No meme coin has been around longer. And now that there’s a DOGE ETF in the works, Dogecoin could be ready for further action. Sui Most people still don’t understand what’s brewing with Sui, and by the time they do, the window to get in will be slammed shut. Sui is already positioning itself as a major player in DeFi, gaming, and next-gen blockchain applications. Franklin Templeton and Grayscale have already thrown their weight behind Sui, which has the kind of architecture that makes Solana look outdated. Analysts are calling for a move past $10, with math, volume, and momentum all pointing in the same direction. Ripple XRP has been the most legally cursed asset in crypto history, but now that chapter is over. Pumping from $0.50 to $2 in two months at the end of 2024, XRP shows decades of pent-up demand unloading all at once. And with the Trump administration easing up on crypto regulations, the entire sector is wide open for capital that’s been sitting on the sidelines for years. Cardano Cardano has been the nerd of the crypto world—too slow, too methodical, too obsessed with academic rigor to actually send it. But something’s changed. The Grayscale ADA ETF application was a signal that institutions aren’t waiting for ADA to prove itself anymore, they’re positioning ahead of the crowd. If this ETF gets approval, ADA could finally leave its slow-burn phase and hit a new ATH. Tron Tron is bigger than ever, stronger than ever, and growing faster than anyone expected. With 125 million active addresses , Tron has a sticky community, real demand, and the $10 million meme coin system to keep it among the top cryptos of the year and bank on the fastest-growing crypto trend. Tron outlasts market crashes, adapts to new trends, and keeps expanding. That’s the kind of resilience that leads to long-term dominance. Chainlink Chainlink is running the infrastructure of the entire DeFi sector, the glue holding the crypto economy together. While the market is pricing it like an afterthought, this could change this year. The NVT ratio is plunging, which means activity is surging while the price hasn’t caught up yet, which, historically, is a buy signal. As the market heats up, demand for LINK is going to hit critical mass. Every bull run has its overlooked altcoin that wakes up and runs the hardest and Chainlink is setting up to be exactly that. iDEGEN & ‘Solana on Bitcoin’ to moon this year The market is roaring, institutions are loading up, and crypto is moving faster than ever. This is the time to bet big, bet smart, and lock in before the world catches on. iDegen vs. DeepSeek, East vs. West, traders picking sides and betting on the future of AI itself, with iDegen’s degenerate backers the ones swinging the hammer. Bitcoin Pepe’s PEP-20 standard lets anyone, anywhere, launch meme coins directly on Bitcoin, and early buyers are getting in at only $0.0243, in a presale reminiscent of Solana’s own ICO price of $0.022 that did 1000x. And this madness hits Bitcoin, the chain that every institution, whale, and sovereign fund on Earth is already loaded up on, potentially sending BPEP to 1000x or more in a blink.

Despite an attempt to climb higher, the Gold price is finding it tough to hold onto gains, all thanks to a surprisingly resilient US Dollar. What’s behind this push and pull in the precious metals market? Let’s dive into the factors influencing gold right now and what it means for traders. Why is Gold Price Fighting an Uphill Battle Against USD Strength? For the second day in a row, gold is attracting buyers, driven by persistent worries about a potential global trade war. Remember Trump’s tariff threats? Those are still hanging over the market, pushing investors towards safe-haven assets like gold. Adding fuel to the fire, expectations are building that the Federal Reserve might just cut interest rates further down the line. Typically, lower interest rates are good news for gold, as they make non-yielding assets like bullion more attractive compared to interest-bearing investments. However, it’s not all smooth sailing for gold. A slight rebound in US bond yields and a modest uptick in the US Dollar are acting as headwinds, preventing XAU/USD from soaring. As we move through the European trading session on Tuesday, gold is hovering just above the $2,900 mark, indicating a struggle to break decisively higher. Key Factors Influencing Gold’s Price Action: Global Trade War Fears: President Trump’s protectionist trade policies continue to rattle investors. His recent hints about automobile levies coming as soon as April 2nd and reciprocal tariffs are keeping trade war concerns alive and supporting safe-haven demand for gold. Federal Reserve (Fed) Rate Cut Expectations: Disappointing US Retail Sales figures and mixed inflation signals have strengthened bets that the Fed might ease monetary policy with rate cuts in September or October. Fed Funds Futures are even pricing in a possible 40 basis point rate cut for 2025. Geopolitical Tensions: While optimism around Russia-Ukraine war talks provides some risk-on sentiment, the underlying geopolitical uncertainty still keeps gold supported as a safe haven. US Dollar (USD) Rebound: A slight recovery in US Treasury bond yields is boosting the US Dollar, which is pushing back against gold’s upward momentum. The USD is attempting to recover from its lowest levels since December 17th. Federal Reserve’s Stance: Rate Cuts or Steady Policy? Recent comments from Federal Reserve officials paint a mixed picture, adding complexity to the **interest rates** outlook and consequently, the Gold price. Hawkish Signals: Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker: Harker suggests a steady policy approach is warranted given a balanced labor market and persistent inflation. He emphasized that future Fed decisions will be data-dependent. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman: Bowman pointed out that high asset prices might be hindering progress on inflation. She stressed the need for more certainty about declining inflation before considering rate cuts. Fed Governor Christopher Waller: Waller acknowledged slow disinflation progress in the past year. However, he indicated that rate cuts could be appropriate in 2025 if inflation trends mirror the disinflation seen in 2024. These comments suggest the Fed is in a wait-and-see mode, carefully monitoring economic data before making any definitive moves on **interest rates**. This uncertainty itself can contribute to volatility in the Gold price. Technical Outlook for Gold Price: Bulls Awaiting Breakout From a technical analysis standpoint, the current range-bound movement in **Gold price** can be seen as a bullish consolidation after the recent surge to record highs. Daily chart oscillators are still in positive territory, indicating the path of least resistance may still be upwards. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing overbought levels. This means any further upward push might encounter strong resistance around the $2,925 horizontal zone. Beyond that, the $2,942-$2,943 area (the all-time high) is the next major hurdle. A decisive break above this level could signal a fresh breakout and continuation of the two-month uptrend. Key Technical Levels to Watch: Level Significance $2,925 Immediate resistance $2,942-$2,943 All-time high, major resistance $2,900 Immediate support $2,878-$2,876 Strong support zone $2,834 Key support level On the downside, initial support appears around the $2,900 mark, followed by a stronger support zone near $2,878-$2,876. Deeper declines towards $2,860-$2,855 might be viewed as buying opportunities. However, a break below $2,834 could trigger technical selling, potentially pushing XAU/USD towards $2,815, $2,800, and even $2,785-$2,784 support levels. USD Strength: A Temporary Headwind or a Trend Reversal? The **USD strength** is currently acting as a brake on gold’s upward movement. After a three-day losing streak, the US Dollar is attempting to bounce back from its lowest point since December 17th. This recovery is partly fueled by the rise in US Treasury yields. Whether this USD rebound is a temporary correction or the start of a more sustained uptrend remains to be seen. Traders are now looking towards the release of the Empire State Manufacturing Index and upcoming speeches from FOMC members for further clues about the US economic outlook and future direction of the US Dollar. Trade War Concerns: Will Tariffs Reignite Safe-Haven Demand? The looming threat of a **trade war**, sparked by President Trump’s protectionist policies, is a significant factor underpinning gold’s appeal. Trump’s repeated mentions of tariffs, particularly on automobiles and reciprocal tariffs on countries charging duties on US imports, are creating uncertainty in global trade relations. This uncertainty often translates to increased demand for safe-haven assets like gold. While optimism about Russia-Ukraine talks might temporarily ease risk aversion, the fundamental concerns about trade tensions and potential economic fallout remain. This backdrop suggests that any dips in gold prices could indeed be seen as buying opportunities, as the underlying supportive factors are still in play. Looking Ahead: Data and Fed Speak in Focus For gold traders, the near-term direction of the Gold price will likely hinge on upcoming US economic data and further insights from Federal Reserve officials. The Empire State Manufacturing Index and speeches from FOMC members are key events to watch. These events can provide fresh impetus to both the USD and gold, creating short-term trading opportunities. In conclusion, while gold is showing resilience and attempting to capitalize on safe-haven demand, the **USD strength** is proving to be a significant hurdle. The tug-of-war between these forces, along with evolving expectations around Federal Reserve policy and global trade dynamics, will continue to shape the Gold price trajectory in the days ahead.

But what if you could identify moments of relative calm, where the market takes a breather? Today, we delve into the EUR/USD currency pair, offering insights into a period of expected stability. Top analysts at UOB Group predict a phase of consolidation for EUR/USD, giving traders a crucial window to reassess strategies. Let’s explore what this means for your trading approach and how you can leverage this Forex market forecast. Understanding EUR/USD Consolidation: What Does it Mean for Forex Trading? In the dynamic realm of Forex trading , consolidation refers to a period where the price of a currency pair, in this case, EUR/USD , moves within a relatively narrow and defined range. Think of it as a pause after a significant move, where neither buyers nor sellers are dominating, leading to sideways price action. For traders, understanding EUR/USD consolidation is vital as it signals a potential shift in market momentum or a continuation of the existing trend after the consolidation phase ends. Here’s a breakdown of what consolidation typically entails: Reduced Volatility: Price swings become less dramatic, offering a temporary respite from rapid fluctuations. Defined Range: The price action is contained between clear support and resistance levels, creating a predictable trading environment for range-bound strategies. Indecision: Consolidation often reflects a period of market indecision as traders evaluate fundamental and technical factors before the next major move. UOB Group’s Forex Forecast: Projecting a Stable Forex Range for EUR/USD Leading financial institution UOB Group has released its latest analysis on the EUR/USD pair, anticipating a phase of consolidation. According to FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, EUR/USD is “expected to consolidate in a 1.0455/1.0505 range.” This projection provides traders with a crucial near-term outlook, suggesting that significant breakouts are unlikely in the immediate future. This UOB Group forecast isn’t just a shot in the dark. It’s based on a detailed technical analysis of market momentum and conditions. While the immediate 24-hour view points to consolidation, the broader outlook remains positive for the Euro in the longer term. Key Takeaways from UOB Group’s Analysis: Timeframe Outlook Expected Range/Target Key Support Level 24-Hour View Consolidation 1.0455/1.0505 N/A (within range) 1-3 Weeks View Positive Technical Target: 1.0530 1.0415 (Strong Support) Decoding the 1.0455/1.0505 Forex Range: Implications for Currency Traders The predicted Forex Range of 1.0455/1.0505 for EUR/USD is more than just numbers; it’s a roadmap for traders in the short term. Understanding this range is crucial for devising effective trading strategies. What does this range tell us? Short-Term Stability: Expect EUR/USD to fluctuate within these boundaries. Day traders and scalpers can look for opportunities to buy at the lower end of the range (1.0455) and sell near the upper end (1.0505). Range Trading Strategies: This is an ideal environment for range-bound trading strategies. Traders can employ techniques like buying low and selling high within the defined levels. Reduced Risk (Potentially): Lower volatility during consolidation can be perceived as a period of reduced risk compared to trending markets, but proper risk management is always essential. Technical Target of 1.0530: A Glimmer of Hope for EUR Bulls? While the immediate focus is on consolidation, UOB Group analysts highlight a positive longer-term Technical Target for EUR/USD at 1.0530. This suggests that despite the current sideways movement, the underlying bullish pressure for the Euro remains intact. What does this Technical Target mean? Potential Upside: The 1.0530 target indicates that analysts anticipate a potential breakout to the upside once the consolidation phase concludes. Longer-Term Perspective: This target is relevant for swing traders and those with a slightly longer-term outlook, suggesting potential gains if the Euro strengthens. Confirmation Signal: A sustained break above the consolidation range and towards 1.0530 could validate the positive outlook and attract further buying interest. Actionable Insights for Navigating EUR/USD Currency Trading During Consolidation So, how can you, as a trader, navigate this period of Currency Trading consolidation in EUR/USD ? Here are some actionable insights: Refine Range Trading Strategies: Focus on strategies designed for range-bound markets. Identify clear entry and exit points within the 1.0455/1.0505 range. Monitor Breakout Potential: While consolidation is expected, be prepared for a potential breakout. Keep an eye on price action near the range boundaries. A break above 1.0505 could signal a move towards the 1.0530 target. Risk Management is Key: Even in consolidation, proper risk management is paramount. Use stop-loss orders to protect your capital, especially if the range breaks unexpectedly. Stay Updated: Market conditions can change rapidly. Keep abreast of the latest Forex news and analysis from reputable sources like UOB Group to adjust your strategies accordingly. Conclusion: Riding the Stable Wave in EUR/USD Forex The EUR/USD pair is currently poised for a period of consolidation, according to UOB Group’s expert analysis. This presents a unique trading environment characterized by a defined Forex Range and reduced volatility. While short-term stability is anticipated, the longer-term Technical Target of 1.0530 suggests potential bullish opportunities ahead. By understanding the dynamics of EUR/USD consolidation and employing appropriate Currency Trading strategies, traders can effectively navigate this phase and position themselves for potential future movements in the Forex market.

The news of USDT (Tether) coming to Bitcoin and Lightning via Taproot Assets has been met with various reactions. Some believe it’s good for Bitcoin (most, actually, based on a small survey I conducted on X; yes, I know the sample size isn’t large enough for the results to be significant. I’M SHARING IT ANYWAY), while others aren’t so enthused about it. Tether (USDT) on Bitcoin and Lightning is: (Please share why in the comments and please RT after you vote.) — Frank Corva (@frankcorva) February 13, 2025 “Others” includes me — I’m not so enthused about it. That said, I’ve tried to be open-minded. I even recently profiled Jesse Shrader, the co-founder and CEO of Amboss , a company that provides intelligent payment infrastructure for payments made over Lightning, who’s a proponent of USDT on Bitcoin and Lightning, in efforts to see what I might be missing about the benefits of being able to transact with digital U.S. dollars over Lightning. In my interview with Shrader, he made the following points: The proliferation of USDT has proven that there’s a demand for U.S. dollars globally USDT is a massive payment mechanism; it processed over $10 trillion in payments in 2024, more than MasterCard, and some percentage of those payments will now be made over Lightning USDT will bring more liquidity to the Lightning Network, which will help the network grow and handle bigger payments From a business perspective, it’s hard to argue that the above aren’t good reasons to bring USDT to Lightning. And, as someone who believes that people should be free to use whatever money they want, I can't argue with them when looking at them through a practical lens. However, I do believe that bringing USDT to Bitcoin and Lightning comes at a price. One dimension of that price is technical, while the other is philosophical. On the technical level, running USDT over Bitcoin and Lightning potentially puts Bitcoin’s security at risk. If we see another Bitcoin hard fork comparable to the one we saw during the Blocksize War , larger economic nodes on the Bitcoin network, like the one operated by Coinbase, which manages much of the bitcoin that backs the U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs, may opt to support the “Tether fork” of the network, which could also include other changes to the network that could jeopardize Bitcoin’s security in the long run. In other words, if the likes of Coinbase, Tether and some other major players in the Bitcoin space support and push for the “Tether fork,” other major economic nodes will likely follow suit. What is more, everyone using USDT on Bitcoin and Lightning would also likely support that side of the fork, because the USDT that remains on the chain of the non-”Tether fork” will likely be nullified. Lyn Alden wrote about this in her essay “ Proof-Of-Stake And Stablecoins: A Blockchain Centralization Dilemma .” In the piece she stated “custodians can nullify the value of all stablecoins on whichever side of the fork they don’t view as the correct one.” Granted, Alden was referring to smart contract blockchains like Ethereum and Solana that rely heavily on DeFi, which stablecoins are a major component of, when she wrote this, but the same would apply to Bitcoin. (Alden was correct in this claim, as we saw when Ethereum shifted from a Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism during 2022’s “ The Merge .” Post-Merge, stablecoins issuers like Circle and Tether only continued to back the tokenized U.S. dollars on Ethereum, and not EthereumPoW (ETHW), the older chain that continued running the Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm.) The same type of scenario could play out with Bitcoin in the event of a chain split, giving Tether an inordinate amount of power over Bitcoin. My other reason for not liking USDT on Bitcoin is a philosophical one. Bitcoin, which was released into the world in the wake of the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2009 , was created as an alternative to the U.S. dollar. At the time, the dollar was being printed en masse (i.e., devalued) to bail out the same banks that caused the crisis. Bitcoin, money that can’t be printed at the whim of a government or central bank, was created to compete with the U.S. dollar, not to help buoy it. Bringing USDT, a mechanism the U.S. government uses to prop up U.S. dollar hegemony around the world, to Bitcoin feels morally wrong to me — and I’m not here for it. So, on a practical level, I get why some are in favor of USDT coming to Bitcoin and Lightning. I just think that many are missing the bigger picture in that Bitcoin has potentially both been put in a vulnerable position and has had part of its value proposition overshadowed (albeit maybe just temporarily) as a result.

For those keeping a close watch on the GBP/USD pair, recent forecasts from UOB Group suggest a potential upward movement in the short term. Is this a fleeting flicker or the start of a more sustained climb for the Pound Sterling against the US Dollar ? Let’s delve into the details and unpack what this forecast means for traders. Decoding the UOB Group’s GBP/USD Forecast: A Technical Analysis Perspective Renowned FX analysts at UOB Group, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, have released their latest technical analysis on the GBP/USD currency pair. Their outlook points towards a likely short-term appreciation of the Pound Sterling . However, this anticipated rise comes with caveats, primarily that any gains are expected to be contained within a defined trading range. Here’s a breakdown of their key projections: Short-Term Bullish Momentum: UOB Group anticipates further strength in the Pound Sterling against the US Dollar in the immediate future. Target Resistance Level: The primary focus for this upward movement is set at 1.2655. This level represents a crucial resistance point that could cap further advances. Trading Range Anticipation: While an upward edge is predicted, analysts believe this is part of a higher trading range, specifically between 1.2580 and 1.2655. This suggests that while GBP/USD may climb, a significant breakout beyond 1.2655 is deemed improbable in the short term. 24-Hour GBP/USD View: Riding the Edge Higher Looking at the very short-term, UOB Group’s 24-hour analysis provides a more granular perspective. Despite a recent pullback after reaching 1.2631, the analysts see scope for GBP/USD to continue its upward trajectory. Key takeaways from the 24-hour outlook: Revised Expectations: Previous expectations of a limited rise due to overbought conditions have been adjusted. GBP/USD demonstrated resilience by edging higher to 1.2635 before settling at 1.2626. Upward Bias Remains: The analysis suggests that there’s still room for GBP/USD to edge higher within the newly defined trading range. Range-Bound Movement: Crucially, the anticipated advance is still expected to occur within the 1.2580/1.2655 range. A decisive break above 1.2655 is considered unlikely in this immediate timeframe. 1-3 Weeks GBP/USD Outlook: Focusing on Key Levels Extending the timeframe to 1-3 weeks, UOB Group maintains a consistent outlook. Their analysis reinforces the likelihood of continued Pound Sterling strength, with the 1.2655 level remaining the key point of interest. Medium-term considerations: Sustained Strength Anticipated: The expectation of further GBP strength persists over the next few weeks. 1.2655 in Focus: The 1.2655 level continues to be the primary resistance to watch. A failure to break decisively above this could reinforce the trading range scenario. Key Support Level: On the downside, the analysts highlight 1.2525 as a crucial support level. A breach below this point would negate the strengthening outlook and suggest a potential shift in momentum. (Note: the previous ‘strong support’ was at 1.2480). What Does This Mean for Forex Traders? UOB Group’s forecast offers valuable insights for Forex traders monitoring the GBP/USD pair. Here are some actionable takeaways: Short-Term Trading Opportunities: The anticipated edge higher within the 1.2580/1.2655 range could present short-term trading opportunities. Traders might consider strategies that capitalize on movements within this range, buying near support and selling near resistance. Monitor Key Levels Closely: The levels of 1.2655 (resistance) and 1.2525 (support) are critical. Price action around these levels will provide clues about the validity of the forecast and potential breakout or breakdown scenarios. Risk Management is Paramount: As always in Forex trading, managing risk is essential. Traders should employ appropriate stop-loss orders and position sizing to protect their capital, especially given the inherent volatility of currency markets. Stay Updated: Market conditions can change rapidly. It’s crucial to stay informed of the latest news and analysis that could impact the GBP/USD pair. Economic data releases, geopolitical events, and shifts in market sentiment can all influence currency movements.

40546639,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=130387,1739980283,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Canada CPI Alert: Will Inflation Data Trigger a Canadian Dollar Surge?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/canada-cpi-inflation-dollar-surge/,"Cryptocurrency investors are keenly watching traditional markets for signals, and this week’s Canada Consumer Price Index (CPI) data is a key event. Expected to remain steady at 1.8% in January, this inflation report could significantly influence the Canadian Dollar (CAD) and the USD/CAD exchange rate. Will the data release confirm expectations, or will we see a surprise that sends ripples through the Forex markets? Let’s dive into what to expect and how it might affect your crypto portfolio indirectly through broader market sentiment. Decoding the Canada CPI and Inflation Rate Expectations Statistics Canada is set to release the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for January, and economists anticipate an annual inflation rate of 1.8%. This figure is crucial as it reflects the pace at which prices for goods and services are changing in Canada. For context, December’s headline inflation also stood at 1.8% year-over-year. However, it’s not just the headline number that matters; the core CPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy, is also under scrutiny. Here’s a quick look at the recent inflation trends: Headline Inflation (Year-over-Year): Expected to remain at 1.8% in January, same as December. Core CPI (Year-over-Year): December saw a 1.8% increase. Monthly Inflation: December headline inflation dropped by 0.4% month-over-month, while core CPI dipped by 0.3%. These numbers are not just economic statistics; they are potential market movers, especially for the Canadian Dollar. Bank of Canada Rate Decisions and Their Impact on CAD The Bank of Canada (BoC) plays a pivotal role in managing inflation through interest rate adjustments. In January, the BoC reduced its interest rate by 25 basis points, reflecting a broader trend of easing monetary policy that began in June 2024. Since then, the policy rate has been slashed by a significant 200 basis points, bringing it down to 3.00% as of January 29. This aggressive easing is partly attributed to concerns about tariff threats and the need to stimulate economic growth. Despite these rate cuts, the Canadian Dollar has shown remarkable resilience. In fact, the CAD has been strengthening against the US Dollar in recent weeks, demonstrating the complex interplay of factors influencing currency values. The BoC’s stance, influenced by inflation data, directly impacts the Canadian Dollar’s trajectory. USD/CAD Forecast: How Will CPI Data Influence the Pair? The USD/CAD pair has been closely watched, particularly as the Canadian Dollar has gained ground. The pair recently touched two-month lows, dipping to the 1.4150 region, after rejecting yearly highs around 1.4800 earlier in the month. This bearish trend suggests underlying strength in the Canadian Dollar, potentially fueled by factors beyond just interest rates. Analysts are keenly anticipating how the January CPI data will affect the USD/CAD forecast. A reading in line with expectations might solidify the Bank of Canada’s current stance, while a significant deviation could trigger market volatility and impact the currency pair. Here’s a summary of potential USD/CAD movements based on different CPI scenarios: CPI Data Outcome Potential USD/CAD Reaction In line with 1.8% forecast BoC policy outlook likely unchanged, moderate CAD support. Higher than 1.8% Potential for increased CAD strength, USD/CAD decline as BoC might reconsider further rate cuts. Lower than 1.8% Possible CAD weakening, USD/CAD increase as it reinforces BoC’s easing stance. Market participants are bracing for Tuesday’s release at 13:30 GMT, as it could set the tone for USD/CAD trading in the near term. Expert Analysis on the Inflation Rate and Canadian Dollar Outlook Experts at BBH (Brown Brothers Harriman) provide a detailed preview, stating: “Canada highlight will be January CPI data Tuesday. Headline is expected at 1.9% y/y vs. 1.8% in December, core median is expected to remain steady at 2.4% y/y, and core trim is expected at 2.6% y/y vs. 2.5% in December.” They also highlight the impact of the GST/HST holiday, which is expected to dampen inflation in certain sectors. The analysts further note, “The Bank of Canada projects headline and core CPI inflation to average 2.1% and 2.5% over Q1, respectively. The BoC has room to ease further, though at a more gradual pace because inflation has been around 2% since August. The market is pricing in 50 bp of easing over the next 12 months that would see the policy rate bottom at 2.50%”. Pablo Piovano, Senior Analyst at Bitcoin World, adds a perspective on the medium-term outlook for the Canadian Dollar: “Bullish attempts should lead USD/CAD to a potential visit to the interim 55-day SMA at 1.4305, prior to the 2025 high of 1.4792 reached on February 3,” suggesting potential upward corrections for the pair. However, he also cautions that “the Canadian Dollar should remain under pressure from US Dollar dynamics and the tariffs narrative in the medium term.” Inflation FAQs: Understanding the Basics To better understand the context of the Canada CPI data, let’s address some frequently asked questions about inflation: What is Inflation? Inflation is simply the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and consequently, the purchasing power of currency is falling. It’s usually expressed as a percentage change, either month-on-month (MoM) or year-on-year (YoY). Core inflation is a more refined measure that excludes volatile components like food and fuel, giving a clearer picture of underlying price pressures. What is the Consumer Price Index (CPI)? The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is the tool used to measure inflation. It tracks the changes in prices of a representative basket of goods and services over time. Central banks, like the Bank of Canada, closely monitor core CPI to guide their monetary policy decisions. A core CPI above 2% often signals potential interest rate hikes to combat inflation, while a reading below 2% might suggest rate cuts to stimulate the economy. How Does Inflation Impact Foreign Exchange? Counterintuitively, higher inflation can strengthen a country’s currency. This is because central banks typically respond to rising inflation by increasing interest rates. Higher interest rates attract foreign investment, as investors seek better returns on their capital, leading to increased demand for the currency and thus, appreciation. Conversely, lower inflation can weaken a currency as it may lead to lower interest rates. Inflation and Gold Prices: What’s the Connection? Traditionally, gold was seen as an inflation hedge. However, in the current economic environment, the relationship is more nuanced. While gold still acts as a safe-haven asset during extreme market uncertainty, high inflation often prompts central banks to raise interest rates. Higher interest rates increase the opportunity cost of holding gold (which doesn’t yield interest), making interest-bearing assets more attractive. Therefore, high inflation can sometimes be negative for gold prices due to the interest rate response from central banks. Conclusion: Staying Informed on Canada CPI and Market Impacts The upcoming Canada CPI data release is a crucial event for Forex markets, particularly for the Canadian Dollar and the USD/CAD pair. While expectations are for inflation to remain steady, any deviation could trigger significant market movements. For cryptocurrency investors, understanding these macroeconomic indicators is essential, as they indirectly influence broader market sentiment and risk appetite. Keep an eye on Tuesday’s data release at 13:30 GMT to see how the market reacts and adjust your strategies accordingly. Will the Canadian Dollar surge, or will the data paint a different picture?

Whale Buys $20 Million Worth Solana (SOL) Today, February 19, 2025, the blockchain-based transaction tracker Lookonchain posted on X (formerly Twitter) that a whale wallet address “AA21…VxH9” moved 123,500 SOL worth $20.80 million from Binance. Whale ""AA21…VxH9"" withdrew 123,500 $SOL ($20.8M) from #Binance today. https://t.co/rv6d81rWlI pic.twitter.com/Vs7W9xJ0W3 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) February 19, 2025 This substantial SOL transfer from Binance during market recovery appears to be a potential accumulation, which could create buying pressure and drive further upside momentum. However, Solana (SOL) has not reacted significantly, as its price remains unchanged. Solana’s Current Price Momentum At press time, the asset is trading near $169, experiencing a modest 1% upward momentum in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume dropped by 20%, indicating that traders and investors are still hesitant to participate in the asset. Solana (SOL) Technical Analysis and Key Levels The potential reason behind this fear is the recent breakdown of the crucial support level at $180, which SOL failed to hold. Additionally, it has fallen below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), indicating that the asset is in a downtrend. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical patterns, it appears that SOL is bearish, with a high probability of staying between $160 and $180 until it crosses the $190 mark. However, if the bearish sentiment and price decline continue, and SOL falls below the $160 level, there is a strong possibility it could drop another 20% to reach $120 in the future. Traders’ $145 Million Worth Long Bet Despite this bearish outlook, traders and investors seem unaffected, as they continue accumulating and betting on the token, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Source: Coinglass According to the data, traders betting on the bullish side are currently dominating the asset, as they are over-leveraged at the $162.8 level and hold $145 million worth of long positions.

Here Are the Details",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/utah-a-us-state-takes-important-step-towards-enacting-bitcoin-reserve-bill-here-are-the-details/,"Utah has taken a significant step toward allowing the state treasurer to invest public funds in Bitcoin with the referral of the “Blockchain and Digital Innovation Amendments” bill to the Senate standing committee. Utah's Bitcoin Reserve Bill Advances to Senate Standing Committee The bill, formally known as HB 230, passed the House 8-1 last month and was referred to the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee on Feb. 13 after its first reading in the Senate. If signed into law, the bill would go into effect on May 7, 2025. Key Provisions of HB 230 The bill, proposed by Utah Representative Jordan Teuscher on Jan. 21, aims to: Authorizing the Utah state treasurer to allocate up to 5% of public funds for investment in “qualified digital assets.” Defining qualifying digital assets as cryptocurrencies or a stablecoin with a 12-month average market value exceeding $500 billion. Bitcoin (BTC) currently has a market cap of $1.9 trillion, making it the primary eligible asset under the proposed criteria. Ethereum (ETH), with a market cap of $322 billion, would not qualify under the current terms of the bill. Utah Could Lead the Nation in Bitcoin Reserves Representative Teuscher highlighted the potential for Utah to become the first US state to successfully pass such a bill, despite at least 11 other states having enacted similar legislation. In a statement on X (formerly Twitter), he wrote: “While Utah would be the 11th state to introduce a similar bill, we would be the first to pass it.” Several other states, including Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Oklahoma, have also recently proposed similar initiatives to create Bitcoin reserves as part of their state investment strategies. The state-level crackdown on Bitcoin investment strategies has gained momentum, particularly following US President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance since taking office in January. Bitcoin's role as a government investment vehicle is becoming a growing policy debate among U.S. lawmakers. *This is not investment advice.

The analyst revealed how this could happen and also boldly asserted that the crypto could hit a trillion market cap in this cycle. How The XRP Price Will Hit $3.4 Trillion Market Cap In an X post , Egrag Crypto predicted that the XRP price would hit a $3.4 trillion market cap at some point. The analyst explained this was possible based on a Logarithmic measured move, which puts XRP’s market cap at $3.4 trillion. Meanwhile, the crypto analyst noted that the non-logarithmic measured move puts the crypto’s market cap at $200 billion. Egrag Crypto further remarked that these logarithmic charts are used for long-term analysis of exponential growth, and linear charts are for short-term precision in trade entries and exits. Based on XRP’s circulating supply, this means that the XRP price could reach $58 if the crypto hits a $3.4 trillion market cap. Meanwhile, XRP could reach a new all-time high (ATH) of $3.5 as it hits a market cap of $200 billion based on the non-logarithmic measured move. Interstingly, Egrag Crypto asserted that XRP could hit a trillion market cap in this market cycle. He revealed that the Fibonacci 1.618, often referred to as the golden ratio, is sitting at $978 billion, which makes a $1 trillion market cap achievable. The analyst further explained that XRP’s market cap skyrocketed 15,000% in the last cycle from just above Fib 1.0 to the top. As such, he is confident that the crypto hitting the Fib 1.618 or a $1 trillion market cap is “super doable.” Egarg Crypto also suggested that XRP could even surpass the $1 trillion market cap, stating that these calculations don’t account for when utility kicks in. It is worth mentioning that the crypto analyst recently predicted that the XRP price could reach $110 in the next cycle. What Needs To Happen For Bullish Continuation The XRP price is rebounding following a crypto market crash yesterday. Egrag Crypto stated for a bullish continuation and to negate the bearish count, XRP needs to close above $2.69 and $2.73 on the 4-hour time frame or even higher time frames to yield even better results. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez stated that XRP looks to be breaking out of an ascending triangle on the lower time frames, setting it up for a potential 4% move toward $2.68. Crypto analyst Dark Defender also suggested that the XRP price was ready to continue its upward trend. According to him, XRP is proceeding based on his projected lines. He remarked that after the corrective Wave 2 move, XRP will continue with the 3rd to 5th Waves on the daily chart. The analyst revealed that the support levels to watch out for are $2.4467 and $1.9996. Meanwhile, the resistance levels to watch out for are $2.6052, $3.3999, $5.8563, and $8.

40546832,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=130385,1739980590,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Decoding the USD Rebound: Is the Dollar’s Bearish Momentum Fading?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/decoding-usd-rebound-momentum/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency and global finance, understanding the ebbs and flows of traditional currencies like the US Dollar is crucial. Recent analysis from ING suggests a potential shift in the US Dollar’s trajectory, indicating that the previously dominant bearish momentum might be losing steam. For crypto investors and traders keenly observing macro trends, this development could signal shifts in risk appetite and asset allocation strategies. Let’s delve into the insights from ING and explore what this potential USD rebound could mean for the broader market. Decoding the Fading Bearish Momentum of the US Dollar For weeks, the US Dollar has navigated a landscape of fluctuating sentiments, influenced by geopolitical tensions and evolving economic indicators. ING’s latest Forex analysis points towards a critical juncture: the bearish momentum that has characterized recent US Dollar movements appears to be waning. This perspective is rooted in the belief that the dollar’s corrective phase might have reached its conclusion. But what exactly does this mean for traders and investors? Here’s a breakdown of the key factors contributing to this potential shift: Correction Run Its Course: ING analysts suggest that the downward correction of the US Dollar might be nearing its end. This implies that the factors pushing the dollar down are losing strength, paving the way for a potential recovery. Anticipating a USD Rebound: The core view is to anticipate and capitalize on a USD rebound , especially against other G10 currencies. This suggests a strategic opportunity to consider long positions in USD pairs. Geopolitical Risk Already Priced In? While a Russia-Ukraine peace deal could trigger a risk-on sentiment that initially weakens the dollar, analysts believe markets have largely factored this in. The longer-term geopolitical risks are still present, potentially limiting any significant dollar sell-off. Geopolitical Tensions and the Currency Market: US-Russia Talks in Focus The current geopolitical landscape, particularly the US-Russia talks concerning Ukraine, remains a central point of attention for the currency market . While a major breakthrough in these talks could temporarily dampen US Dollar strength, the overall sentiment suggests this impact might be short-lived. Key takeaways regarding geopolitical influences: Market Focus on US-Russia Talks: Any developments from these bilateral discussions are closely watched by the market and can induce short-term volatility in the Forex market . Limited Optimistic Push: Unless there’s a significant breakthrough, the optimistic market sentiment driven by hopes of de-escalation might lose steam. This could stabilize or even strengthen the US Dollar . Dollar Recovery Potential: As the initial euphoria of potential peace fades, the US Dollar is expected to regain ground, reinforcing the view of fading bearish momentum . USD Positioning: Are Dollar Longs Less Stretched? Investor positioning in the US Dollar is another crucial element in understanding its potential trajectory. Recent data provides insights into whether the market is still heavily skewed towards dollar longs, which could influence future price movements. Analyzing USD positioning: CFTC Data Insights: CFTC data on USD positioning against G10 currencies (excluding SEK and NOK) reveals a slight decrease in dollar longs. Seven-Week Low: USD longs have edged down to a seven-week low, indicating that some long positions have been trimmed. Above +20% Open Interest: Despite the decrease, USD long positions remain above 20% of open interest. This suggests that while slightly less stretched, the market is still net long on the dollar, providing a base for potential USD rebound . Macro Developments Take a Backseat – For Now While macro-economic data usually drives currency market movements, this week, geopolitical events and positioning data are taking center stage. However, key macro releases are still on the horizon and could regain importance soon. Macroeconomic factors to watch: Secondary Role This Week: Macro developments are expected to play a secondary role in influencing the Forex market this week, overshadowed by geopolitical news. FOMC Minutes Tomorrow: The release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes tomorrow is a notable exception and could provide insights into future monetary policy, potentially impacting the US Dollar . Limited Impact Today: Today’s Empire Manufacturing index and TIC flows are expected to have a limited immediate impact on the market, reinforcing the focus on geopolitical and positioning factors. Actionable Insights for Forex and Crypto Traders For those navigating the intersection of Forex analysis and cryptocurrency trading, understanding the potential for a USD rebound offers several actionable insights: Monitor Geopolitical Developments: Stay keenly attuned to news from US-Russia talks and any shifts in geopolitical risk sentiment. These events can create short-term trading opportunities in USD pairs. Watch FOMC Minutes: Pay close attention to the FOMC minutes for signals on the future direction of US monetary policy. Hawkish hints could further bolster the US Dollar . Assess Risk Sentiment: Gauge overall market risk sentiment. A move towards risk-off could favor the US Dollar as a safe-haven asset, strengthening its rebound .

One name that has been gaining massive attention is Coldware (COLD), a blockchain network that is revolutionizing mobile staking and Web3 applications. Coldware (COLD) allows users to stake and validate transactions directly from their smartphones, offering a scalable and energy-efficient alternative to traditional proof-of-stake models. This mobile-first approach is attracting a growing number of investors, with many predicting Coldware (COLD) will be the next big winner in the altcoin space. Why Coldware (COLD) Stands Out Among the Best Cryptos to Buy Now Unlike Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE), which have already seen massive growth, Coldware (COLD) is still in its early stages, presenting an opportunity for high returns. With increasing adoption of Web3 and mobile staking, Coldware’s unique blockchain infrastructure is set to disrupt multiple industries. As the demand for decentralized networks and scalable blockchain solutions grows, Coldware (COLD) is positioned as the next big altcoin. Investors looking for the best crypto to buy now should keep an eye on Coldware as it gains momentum in 2025, with analysts predicting a price surge to $6 in the coming months. Solana (SOL) Faces Key Resistance as Investors Watch for the Next Move Solana (SOL) remains one of the most discussed cryptocurrencies in 2025, with analysts debating whether it can reclaim its all-time highs. After experiencing a significant price decline from its January peak of $286 to $184, Solana is now battling to maintain its support levels. With the upcoming token unlock set to release billions of dollars worth of SOL into the market, uncertainty looms over its short-term price action. Some investors are betting on a rebound, while others are diversifying into alternative assets like Coldware (COLD) to hedge against potential losses. Dogecoin (DOGE) Gains Popularity but Lacks Fundamental Growth Dogecoin (DOGE) has remained a fan favorite, largely due to its meme-driven community and continued support from influential figures like Elon Musk. While DOGE has shown resilience during market downturns, its long-term growth potential remains questionable due to a lack of fundamental utility beyond speculation. Despite this, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to attract traders who are looking for short-term gains. However, investors seeking real-world use cases and sustainable growth are shifting toward more innovative projects like Coldware (COLD) , which offers practical applications in decentralized finance, gaming, and IoT.

One such innovation is Coldware (COLD) . It distinguishes itself by enabling transactions and staking directly from mobile devices, offering a sustainable and user-friendly experience. Coldware (COLD): The Pioneering Spirit Coldware’s approach is drawing considerable attention, not just from individual investors but also from industries looking to integrate blockchain solutions into everyday operations. With an eye on future possibilities, Coldware (COLD) is well-positioned for substantial growth, promising advancements in the realm of Web3 applications and staking methodologies. Projected growth trends suggest Coldware's value could climb significantly, making it an intriguing option for those tracking upcoming crypto stars. Market analysts are forecasting a potential leap to $6, showcasing its promising future. Challenges and Opportunities for Solana (SOL) Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) remains a key player, though it faces hurdles, particularly after a recent drop from $286 to $184. With market dynamics shifting, Solana aims to stabilize, even as investors weigh their options amidst economic uncertainties. The impending token unlock could lead to fluctuations in its value. Investors are divided, with some banking on recovery, while others are exploring diversified portfolios with up-and-coming cryptos like Coldware. Dogecoin (DOGE): Community Driven, But What's Next? Dogecoin (DOGE), on the other hand, continues to ride the wave of its meme legacy. Despite popularity, its market sustainability and fundamental utility remain topics of debate. It attracts speculative investors who relish its community spirit and high-profile endorsements. Nonetheless, the hunt for substantial and consistent applications might lead some to consider projects like Coldware (COLD) , which are carving out niches in decentralized sectors such as finance and gaming.

While the network remains strong, concerns over scalability and broader market trends have added pressure on SOL’s performance. As Solana struggles, investors are eyeing alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This emerging DeFi project, currently in its presale, offers a decentralized lending platform with real-world utility. With growing demand and a structured roadmap, analysts suggest MUTM could be a high-potential investment in the months ahead. Why Is Solana (SOL) Struggling? Solana (SOL) has been under selling pressure, with its price dropping nearly 3% as investor sentiment weakens. Despite its strong network activity and continued development, concerns over liquidity and market conditions have contributed to its recent struggles. The total value locked (TVL) on Solana has also declined, indicating a slowdown in DeFi participation on the network. This shift suggests that investors are becoming more cautious, opting to secure profits rather than hold through market uncertainty. Another factor impacting Solana is the anticipated release of 11.2 million SOL tokens from the FTX estate on March 1, 2025. Large token unlocks often create selling pressure, leading to increased volatility and hesitation among investors. Broader macroeconomic trends and shifting market dynamics have also played a role, prompting some traders to explore other high-potential investments while Solana navigates this period of uncertainty. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) As Solana faces uncertainty, investors are shifting their focus to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a promising DeFi project offering decentralized lending and borrowing solutions. Mutuum removes intermediaries, giving users full control over their assets. This approach has already attracted experienced investors looking for an early-stage opportunity with strong potential. Mutuum Finance introduces two lending models: peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P). In the P2C model, users deposit assets into liquidity pools, where smart contracts automatically manage loans and set interest rates based on supply and demand. This ensures a secure and efficient system for both lenders and borrowers. The P2P model offers more flexibility, allowing users to set their own lending terms and access tokens not commonly found in liquidity pools. This means investors can supply or borrow assets like Dogecoin (DOGE) or Pepe (PEPE), giving them broader opportunities beyond standard DeFi tokens. Mutuum Finance’s presale is moving fast, with investors rushing to secure their tokens at the lowest price. Over $720,000 has already been raised, and with Phase 1 nearing sellout, demand is only increasing. Early buyers are eager to lock in MUTM at $0.01, knowing the price will rise to $0.015 in Phase 2. Beyond the presale, analysts predict that MUTM will surge to $0.06 by launch, giving early investors a 600% gain. However, the growth potential doesn’t stop there. With increasing demand, strong fundamentals, and the upcoming platform launch, experts suggest that MUTM’s price will rise significantly beyond $0.06 in a short time. Some projections indicate that the token will reach a 1700% surge, making it a high-potential investment for those entering early. Mutuum Finance is running a $100,000 giveaway to reward early investors and boost community engagement. Ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM, giving them a chance to capitalize on the project’s growth before its official launch. As the presale gains traction, this giveaway adds extra incentive for investors looking to secure their holdings early. Full details and participation rules are available on the official Mutuum Finance website. With its structured tokenomics, stablecoin integration, and buy-and-distribute mechanism, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a long-term investment. As more investors look for high-growth opportunities, MUTM is becoming a top choice, offering real utility and strong market demand.

The initiative, called the Open Intents Framework (OIF), was kickstarted by contributors from the Ethereum Foundation and is supported by 25 projects including teams building layer-2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, ZKsync, and Scroll, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk. The goal of the initiative is to bring “intents” to all corners of the Ethereum ecosystem, which is a technological feature that lets a blockchain user accomplish a specific goal by asking an intermediary to fulfill that goal (like a trade or transaction they want to make.) There are some standards out there that are already trying to make cross-chain transactions easier by using intents. ERC-7683, which was introduced by the team behind the decentralized exchange Uniswap and the Across protocol, is one of those standards circulating the Ethereum space lately, and is supposed to address fragmentation and allow more chains in the Ethereum ecosystem to interoperate. But the OIF team claims that they will build on that standard through their framework allowing intents to function at scale. “By offering shared infrastructure and execution coordination, OIF makes intent-based transactions permissionless, efficient, and accessible for all projects,” the press release said. “As Ethereum's ecosystem becomes increasingly multichain, intents help streamline fragmented user experiences by enabling seamless, near-instant cross-chain transactions through specialized solvers. However, integrating intents remains complex and resource-intensive, making an open intents framework essential to standardize infrastructure, reduce barriers to adoption, and foster broader collaboration across the ecosystem,” the team shared with CoinDesk.

In an announcement on X, the firm said three Bitcoin non-profits, Brink, Open Sats, and Human Rights Foundation (HRF), will be responsible for allocating the funds. The contribution fulfills the company’s earlier pledge to donate 10% of the gross profits from its Bitwise Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) BITB annually. According to the firm , this is the first annual donation based on that commitment. It said: “Today, Bitwise is donating $150,000 to support Bitcoin open-source developers, who work tirelessly to secure and maintain the network.” Meanwhile, the firm thanked the investors of its Bitcoin ETF product, noting that the donation was possible because they chose BITB instead of the several other Bitcoin ETFs available. Bitwise BITB is among the top Bitcoin ETFs by assets, with $3.962 billion in assets under management (AUM). While this is only a small fraction of the $56.53 billion in BlackRock’s IBIT, the ETF is the fourth largest behind IBIT, Fidelity FBTC, and Ark 21Shares ARKB. The firm added that its contributions will continue to grow as BITB attracts more investment, noting that it will “strive to do our part to be a good steward of this incredible ecosystem alongside you.” Bitwise donations show it made $1.5 million in gross profits on its Bitcoin ETF in 2024. This is not completely surprising, given that the firm charges one of the lowest fees, 0.2%. Compared to it, BlackRock and Fidelity, which charge a 0.25% fee and have far higher AUM, likely made way more money. ETFs boost institutional Bitcoin adoption Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs have contributed significantly to the institutional adoption of Bitcoin according to the latest data on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 13F filings. A 13F filing is filed quarterly by institutional investment managers to show securities holdings that exceed $100 million. According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan , the value of Bitcoin ETF holdings disclosed through 13F filings reached $38.7 billion in Q4, a threefold increase from the $12.4 billion in Q3. Overall, professional investors now own 28% of the Bitcoin ETF assets and Hougan predicted this could surpass 40% by the end of 2025. Bloomberg senior analyst Eric Balchunas also noted that IBIT alone has 1,100 holders who filed 13Fs, showing massive institutional adoption towards the end of the year. Signs of the growing ETF adoption are already evident even among retail holders. Popular Bitcoin maximalist Plan B disclosed that he had transferred all his Bitcoin to ETFs because it helped him better manage his BTC. He said: “Yes I know, not your keys not your coins. But it is just easier for me to manage bitcoin the same way as equities and bonds. Also, not having to hassle with keys gives me peace of mind. I guess I am not a maxi anymore.” Another way institutional investors have been gaining exposure to Bitcoin is through the MSTR stock. The number of 13F filings for MSTR has grown substantially since the company adopted a Bitcoin treasury strategy, reaching 1,051 in Q4 of 2024. Analysts predict Bitcoin will see a resurgence Meanwhile, industry stakeholders believe Bitcoin is poised to see its value rise despite recent struggles. Crypto analyst James Van Straten noted that Bitcoin will reach new highs as financial conditions loosen. He noted the significance of BTC institutional adoption to all these, stating: “Bitcoin became even further entrenched into the financial system with the addition of ETFs and options” However, Van Straten does not expect Bitcoin to see a major price spike this month and believes a new high will not come until mid-March. BTC is currently trading at $95,000 and has fallen 10% in the past 30 days.

40546961,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=130415,1739980850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unstoppable WTI Oil Surges Above $71.50 Amid Shocking Kazakhstan Supply Disruptions,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/wti-oil-prices-kazakhstan-disruptions/,"Cryptocurrency markets are not the only ones experiencing volatility. Global energy markets are also feeling the tremors. The price of WTI Oil Prices is making headlines as it has dramatically surged past $71.50. This sharp increase is not due to typical market fluctuations, but rather to alarming Kazakhstan Supply Disruptions triggered by a recent Ukrainian drone attack. Let’s dive into the details of how this geopolitical event is impacting the energy sector and what it means for traders and investors. Why are WTI Oil Prices Skyrocketing? The primary driver behind this WTI Oil price surge is the disruption to Crude Oil supply from Kazakhstan. A Ukrainian drone attack has targeted a critical pipeline infrastructure in Russia, specifically the Kropotkinskaya station. This station is a key node in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), responsible for transporting approximately 1% of the global Crude Oil supply. The attack has effectively curtailed shipments, creating immediate concerns about supply shortages in the already sensitive Energy Markets . Here’s a breakdown of the key factors influencing the price hike: Drone Attack Impact: The Ukrainian drone strike on the Kropotkinskaya pumping station has directly disrupted the flow of Crude Oil from Kazakhstan. Supply Reduction: This pipeline is crucial for transporting about 1% of global Crude Oil , and its disruption immediately tightens global supply. Geopolitical Tensions: The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict adds a layer of geopolitical risk to Energy Markets , making them more susceptible to price swings. Western Firm Impact: Major Western energy companies like Chevron and ExxonMobil are directly affected by these Kazakhstan Supply Disruptions , as they rely on this pipeline for transporting their Crude Oil . Peace Talk Uncertainty: While peace talks are ongoing in Saudi Arabia, the absence of Ukraine and their firm stance against agreements made without their involvement adds uncertainty, preventing market stabilization. Understanding WTI Oil: The Benchmark Crude For those new to the energy market, understanding what WTI Oil Prices represent is crucial. WTI stands for West Texas Intermediate, and it’s a specific grade of Crude Oil . It’s known as a ‘light’ and ‘sweet’ crude due to its low density and sulfur content, making it easy and cost-effective to refine. WTI is primarily sourced in the United States and its delivery hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, is famously known as “The Pipeline Crossroads of the World”. Because of its quality and strategic location, WTI Oil serves as a major global benchmark for Crude Oil pricing. Let’s look at some key characteristics of WTI Oil in a table: Characteristic Description Type Light Sweet Crude Oil Benchmark Major global Oil Prices benchmark Origin United States (West Texas) Hub Cushing, Oklahoma Refining Easy and cost-effective Factors Influencing WTI Oil Prices: Beyond Supply Shocks While Kazakhstan Supply Disruptions are the immediate cause of the current price surge, several factors continuously influence WTI Oil Prices . Understanding these drivers is essential for anyone tracking Energy Markets . Supply and Demand Dynamics: Like any commodity, the fundamental drivers are supply and demand. Global economic growth typically increases demand, while recessions decrease it. Geopolitical Events: Political instability, wars, and sanctions can significantly disrupt Crude Oil supply, leading to price volatility. The current Russia-Ukraine conflict and drone attack exemplify this. OPEC Decisions: The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies (OPEC+) play a crucial role. Their decisions on production quotas directly impact global Crude Oil supply and, consequently, Oil Prices . US Dollar Strength: Since Crude Oil is primarily traded in US dollars, the dollar’s value influences prices. A weaker dollar can make Oil Prices more affordable for buyers using other currencies, potentially increasing demand and price. Inventory Data: Weekly inventory reports from the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) provide insights into supply and demand balances. Decreases in inventories often suggest rising demand, pushing Oil Prices up. Navigating the Volatile Energy Markets: Key Takeaways The current situation highlights the inherent volatility of Energy Markets and the significant impact of geopolitical events on Oil Prices . For crypto investors also monitoring traditional markets, understanding these dynamics can provide valuable insights into broader economic trends. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on geopolitical developments, especially those involving major Crude Oil producing regions and transit routes like Kazakhstan and Russia. Monitor Inventory Reports: Pay attention to weekly API and EIA inventory data to gauge short-term supply and demand shifts in Energy Markets . Diversify Investments: Energy market volatility can impact broader financial markets. Diversification remains a key strategy to mitigate risk. Understand OPEC+ Actions: Track OPEC+ meetings and announcements regarding production quotas, as these decisions have a direct impact on global Oil Prices . Conclusion: Energy Market Turmoil and its Ripple Effects The surge in WTI Oil Prices due to Kazakhstan Supply Disruptions is a stark reminder of the interconnectedness of global Energy Markets and geopolitical stability. The Ukrainian drone attack and the resulting supply concerns have sent ripples through the market, pushing prices upwards. As traders and analysts closely monitor the Russia-Ukraine peace talks and await further updates on supply flows, the volatility in Oil Prices is expected to persist. For those involved in cryptocurrency and broader financial markets, keeping an eye on these Energy Markets developments is crucial for navigating the complex global economic landscape.

But until now, a critical piece has been missing: the ability for AI agents to seamlessly interact and transact across different blockchain networks. EXE's launch of its Interchain AI Protocol marks a pivotal shift in this landscape, introducing a unified platform where machine-to-machine transactions can flow freely across chains. Building on CrossF i's established ecosystem of 100,000 users and $28M market cap, EXE isn't just theorizing about the future of AI-blockchain integration — it’s already delivering it. As the AI agent market barrels toward a projected $47B valuation by 2030 , the implications of this launch extend far beyond typical blockchain innovations. Breaking Down Blockchain Barriers The current landscape of AI deployment across blockchain networks resembles a fragmented maze. Developers face a daunting array of challenges. These include multiple tokens for different networks, complex bridging mechanisms that often fail, and siloed GPU resources that drive up costs. Each blockchain operates as its own isolated kingdom, forcing AI applications to either limit their scope or navigate an increasingly complex web of cross-chain solutions. EXE's protocol dismantles these barriers entirely. By creating a unified market for GPU resources across networks, they've transformed what was once a complex integration challenge into a single API call. This means developers can tap into Ethereum's GPU resources while running their application on Solana, or leverage Arbitrum's computational power from a Base deployment — all without wrestling with multiple token standards or bridge protocols. This level of integration slashes both development time and costs, making advanced AI applications viable for smaller teams and projects. The Machine Economy Takes Shape We're witnessing the birth of a new economic paradigm where machines don't just assist human transactions — they conduct business autonomously. EXE's agent-to-agent workflow represents the first practical implementation of this vision at scale. As the first platform to unite AI agents and human participants under one economic framework, EXE enables fluid collaboration between autonomous systems and human operators. The protocol creates an environment where both machines and users can form dynamic partnerships and execute transactions without traditional barriers or intermediaries. Imagine AI agents automatically negotiating and purchasing computational resources, trading specialized services, or collaborating on complex tasks across different blockchain networks, all without human intervention. This isn't just theoretical. With EXE's protocol, an AI agent running sentiment analysis on Arbitrum can instantly hire another agent's GPU resources on Optimism to process a surge in data. A machine learning model on Base can automatically purchase additional training capacity from unused resources on Avalanche. These transactions happen in real time, without centralized intermediaries, and at a fraction of the current cost. The implications are profound. As the AI agent market races forward, EXE is positioning itself as the fundamental infrastructure for this machine-to-machine economy. Early metrics from CrossFi's ecosystem show that automated agent transactions already account for 30% of network activity, suggesting we're just seeing the beginning of this transformation. Deflationary Dynamics The protocol's economic model addresses a core challenge in blockchain networks: sustainable value capture from increasing network activity. Each AI transaction on EXE automatically burns a portion of the fees, permanently removing tokens from circulation. This mechanism creates natural scarcity as network usage grows, particularly significant given the rapidly expanding AI computation market. Early simulations demonstrate how this model could reshape token dynamics. With projected daily AI transactions reaching millions across supported chains, the burn rate outpaces new token emissions by a significant margin. The system rewards active GPU providers and AI service operators while maintaining constant deflationary pressure through actual network usage rather than artificial supply constraints. The model also solves the traditional multi-token friction in cross-chain systems. Instead of juggling different tokens for each chain's GPU resources, users leverage a single, increasingly scarce asset. This unified approach streamlines machine-to-machine payments while building long-term value through genuine utility and growing demand for AI computation. Building the Machine-First Future CrossFi's established infrastructure provides EXE with immediate real-world validation. The protocol launches with 50,000 active mainnet wallets already integrated, plus 700,000 testnet participants stress-testing its capabilities. This built-in user base puts EXE miles ahead of typical blockchain launches, providing genuine usage data rather than theoretical projections. The numbers tell a compelling story. GPU providers on the network report 85% resource utilization, significantly higher than traditional cloud services. AI developers save an average of 60% on computing costs compared to centralized alternatives. The network processes over 100,000 daily agent-to-agent transactions, demonstrating robust adoption of autonomous machine commerce. Market forecasts suggest this growth marks the beginning of a larger transformation. As AI capabilities expand and more chains join the network, EXE's unified GPU marketplace positions itself at the center of a new blockchain paradigm. Enterprise adoption shows particular promise, with several Fortune 500 companies already exploring EXE's infrastructure for its AI deployment needs. The next wave of blockchain innovation will focus on machine-to-machine interactions rather than human transactions. EXE's protocol, backed by CrossFi's proven track record and deflationary tokenomics, provides the essential infrastructure for this shift. By solving the critical challenges of cross-chain AI deployment while maintaining true decentralization, EXE sets the stage for an autonomous digital economy where machines handle their own resource allocation, service procurement, and value exchange.

It has retraced by double digits from its 2024 high as investors wait for a catalyst. One catalyst may be a $5,000 stimulus check being mulled by Elon Musk’s led DOGE team. Dogecoin Price May Pump as Elon Musk Mulls Stimulus Checks A potential catalyst for the Dogecoin price is a potential DOGE dividend. The dividend will be in the form of a $5,000 stimulus check sent to American taxpayers using the savings that the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE has found. Elon Musk and Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, said that the DOGE team has already saved taxpayers $50 billion so far. Bessent added that the savings will likely be more as the team’s work continues. Elon Musk believes that the total savings could get to $2 trillion. James Fishback, an American executive recommended that DOGE should consider distributing the savings to taxpayers. He said : “ President Trump and Elon Musk should announce a ‘DOGE Dividend’ —a tax refund check sent to every taxpayer, funded exclusively with a portion of the total savings delivered by DOGE.” In response to the X post, Elon Musk said that he would speak with the president about it. Such a stimulus check would likely lead to higher crypto prices mirroring to what happened in 2020 and 2021. At the time, Trump’s and Biden’s stimulus checks helped to push Bitcoin and DOGE prices higher. However, it is unclear whether the stimulus checks will come as officials will be afraid of stimulating inflation. Also, a report by Bloomberg estimates that the real figure of the total savings so far is $16 billion. DOGE Price Analysis: Elliot Wave Points to a Surge The Dogecoin price chart shows that the coin may stage a strong comeback in the coming weeks. It recently crashed from a high of $0.4842 in November to a low of $0.2 this year. Its lowest point was a notable level since it was slightly above $0.2287, its highest swing in March last year. That is known as a break-and-retest pattern, which is a highly bullish sign. An Elliot Wave analysis shows the value of DOGE is in currently in the fourth wave, which is a corrective one. This performance means that the coin will then move to the bullish fifth wave. A conservative move to last year’s high of $0.48 would be a 90% surge from the current level. Dogecoin Price The bullish DOGE price forecast will become invalid if the coin crashes below the key support level at $0.20.

Argentine President Responds to $LIBRA Token Scandal,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/fraud-or-misstep-argentine-president-responds-to-libra-token-scandal,"Argentine President Javier Milei denies any wrongdoing in the collapse of $LIBRA, asserting that his social media post was not an endorsement and blaming political opponents for exploiting the controversy. Milei Refutes Claims of Endorsement Argentine President Javier Milei has denied any involvement in fraudulent activities related to the cryptocurrency $LIBRA , which suffered a dramatic collapse shortly after he mentioned it in a social media post. The president asserted that his intentions were solely to support economic growth and entrepreneurship in Argentina. On Friday, Milei shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) about $LIBRA, stating that the cryptocurrency aimed to boost Argentina’s economy by funding small businesses. His post included a link to a website selling the digital asset, which featured his well-known slogan, “Long live freedom.” Following his remarks, the token surged in value before plummeting, leading to significant financial losses for investors. Milei later deleted the post, citing uncertainties regarding the project. Defending His Actions Speaking on Argentine TV channel Todo Noticias on Monday, Milei defended his actions, emphasizing that he acted in ""good faith."" He compared the investors’ losses to gambling risks, stating, ""If you go to a casino and lose money, what's there to complain about when you knew the risks?"" The president also argued that his social media post did not constitute an endorsement but was merely an act of sharing information. His administration clarified that the president was not involved in any phase of $LIBRA’s development and had removed the message to prevent further unintended exposure. Political Fallout and Legal Challenges The incident has triggered a wave of legal and political repercussions. Opposition leaders have accused Milei of being complicit in a fraudulent scheme and have filed multiple criminal complaints, including one with the U.S. Department of Justice. The Popular Unity political party, among others, lodged a formal complaint alleging that $LIBRA was part of a ""rug pull"" scam—a deceptive practice where developers inflate a token’s value before abruptly withdrawing funds and leaving investors with worthless assets. A judge has been assigned to assess whether Milei should face fraud charges in connection with the incident. Meanwhile, critics have drawn parallels between this case and former U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent launch of the $TRUMP memecoin, which experienced a similar boom-and-bust cycle. Government Response In response to the backlash, the presidential office accused political adversaries of exploiting the situation for personal gain. It further announced that Argentina’s anti-corruption office had been directed to investigate the matter to ensure transparency and address public concerns. Despite the growing controversy, Milei remains firm in his stance, dismissing allegations of wrongdoing while maintaining that his original intention was to highlight potential funding avenues for Argentine entrepreneurs.

The downturn coincides with a network contraction, indicating reduced activity. The token is currently trading at a little over $18. However, certain factors signal that a rebound might just be on the horizon. Comeback For LINK According to the latest findings by popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the MVRV Ratio, which measures trader profitability, reveals that those who purchased LINK in the last 30 days are at an average loss of 16%, a level historically linked to selling exhaustion. Additionally, whales are showing confidence despite the dip. In fact, these entities accumulated over $20 million worth of LINK tokens in the past 24 hours alone, which demonstrated early signs of a potential recovery. However, for a confirmed uptrend, LINK must break above $19 to target $23.70. On the downside, the critical $15.50 support level is crucial – losing it could invalidate the bullish outlook and lead to further losses. Chainlink has been one of the top assets that World Liberty Financial, a financial company linked to the Trump family, has invested in over the past two months. This not only briefly boosted LINK’s price in December but also intensified whale accumulation. US blockchain company Ripple recently partnered with Chainlink to accelerate the adoption of the cross-border payments firm’s stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD). As part of the deal, Chainlink’s price oracle feeds will offer real-time pricing data for RLUSD on Ethereum to help DeFi applications integrate the stablecoin for trading and lending, among other use cases. Chainlink Tops in RWA Space Santiment recently reported that Chainlink continues to dominate the development activity in the real-world assets (RWA) sector. The decentralized oracle network outpaced competitors such as Ethereum-based synthetic asset platform Synthetix (SNX), privacy and tokenization-focused Dusk Foundation (DUSK), and Reserve Protocol (RSR), which lets users create a new currency backed 1:1 by a collection of tokenized assets.

40547330,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=130422,1739981526,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Correction: EUR/USD Plummets as Resurgent US Dollar Reacts to Fed’s Restrictive Policy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/eur-usd-corrects-us-dollar/,"Cryptocurrency markets are closely watching traditional finance for cues, and the recent movements in the Forex market are sending ripples. The EUR/USD pair is experiencing a notable correction, presenting traders with both challenges and opportunities. This shift is primarily driven by a robust rebound in the US Dollar , fueled by the Federal Reserve’s unwavering commitment to a restrictive policy stance . Let’s dive into the details of this developing situation and understand what it means for the broader financial landscape. Why is EUR/USD Correcting? Decoding the US Dollar’s Resurgence After a period of consolidation, the US Dollar is flexing its muscles again, pushing the EUR/USD pair downwards to near the 1.0450 mark. This resurgence is primarily attributed to signals from Federal Reserve officials indicating no immediate adjustments to their current monetary policy. Several factors are contributing to this dynamic: Hawkish Fed Stance: Despite some expectations for policy easing, recent statements from Fed officials like Governor Michelle Bowman and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker suggest a cautious approach. They emphasize the need for “greater confidence” in sustained inflation reduction before considering any policy shifts. Strong Economic Indicators: The US economy continues to show resilience, with a balanced labor market and persistent inflationary pressures. This strength gives the Fed room to maintain its restrictive policy without triggering immediate economic downturn fears. FOMC Minutes Anticipation: Investors are keenly awaiting the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes from their January meeting. These minutes are expected to provide deeper insights into the Fed’s thinking and future policy direction, further influencing the US Dollar’s trajectory. Essentially, the market is recalibrating its expectations regarding interest rates , realizing that the Fed is likely to maintain its current stance for a longer duration than previously anticipated. This realization is bolstering the US Dollar and consequently pressuring the EUR/USD pair. ECB’s Concerns and Euro Weakness: A Double Whammy for EUR/USD Adding to the EUR/USD’s woes is the growing uncertainty surrounding the Euro. European Central Bank (ECB) policymaker Joachim Nagel has voiced concerns about potential US tariffs, particularly under a Trump administration, and their impact on the German economy. Germany’s export-oriented economy is especially vulnerable to trade tensions, and these fears are weighing on the Euro’s outlook. Furthermore, market expectations of ECB interest rate cuts are also capping the Euro’s potential upside. The anticipation of multiple rate cuts this year, driven by concerns about inflation undershooting the ECB’s 2% target, weakens the Euro’s appeal compared to the US Dollar , which is backed by a more hawkish central bank. Technical Levels to Watch in EUR/USD Trading From a technical analysis perspective, the EUR/USD pair is currently navigating key levels. While the pair has retreated from the 1.0500 resistance, it’s crucial to note: Support at 50-day EMA: The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) around 1.0430 is acting as a crucial support level. Holding above this level could suggest continued bullish potential in the medium term. RSI Momentum: The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering below 60.00. A sustained break above this level would signal strengthening bullish momentum. Key Support and Resistance: The February 10 low of 1.0285 represents a significant support zone, while the December 6 high of 1.0630 acts as a key resistance barrier for Euro bulls. Traders should closely monitor these technical indicators alongside fundamental developments to gauge the future direction of the EUR/USD pair. Understanding the Euro: Key FAQs for Crypto-Savvy Investors For those in the crypto space, understanding traditional currencies like the Euro is essential for grasping global market dynamics. Here are some frequently asked questions about the Euro: Question Answer What is the Euro? The Euro (EUR) is the currency of the Eurozone, comprising 19 EU countries. It’s the second most traded currency globally, heavily influencing Forex markets and impacting global liquidity. What is the ECB’s role? The European Central Bank (ECB) manages the Eurozone’s monetary policy, primarily through setting interest rates to maintain price stability. ECB decisions significantly impact the Euro’s value. How does inflation data affect the Euro? Eurozone inflation data, like the HICP, is critical. Higher-than-expected inflation may compel the ECB to raise interest rates , strengthening the Euro. What economic data influences the Euro? Key economic indicators like GDP, PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment reflect the Eurozone’s economic health.
