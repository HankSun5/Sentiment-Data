Here’s the Best Altcoin to Buy and Hold in 2025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-your-portfolio-stuck-heres-the-best-altcoin-to-buy-and-hold-in-2025/,"Investors hunting for explosive growth in the crypto market are turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending platform whose presale is rapidly gaining momentum. Over $665,000 has already been secured in the opening phase of the presale, with more than 1,050 holders claiming stakes at the current price of $0.01 per token. 60% of Phase One tokens sold out within days and the project is demonstrating a level of demand rarely seen in early-stage crypto ventures. For early buyers, this translates to a guaranteed 600% return at launch and a potential 100x surge within two years. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Platform Built for Real-World Use Mutuum Finance (MUTM) addresses a critical need in decentralized finance: accessible, secure lending and borrowing. The platform allows users to either deposit assets into liquidity pools for passive income or borrow funds against their crypto holdings without selling them. Lenders earn variable yields tied to market demand, while borrowers retain ownership of their collateralized assets, a win-win structure attracting both cautious earners and strategic traders. Take Ethereum (ETH) holders, for example. By locking 10 ETH as collateral, they can borrow stablecoins to fund other investments or expenses, all while benefiting if ETH’s value climbs. This flexibility eliminates the need to liquidate positions during market dips, a feature resonating with investors seeking long-term portfolio growth. Driving Demand Through Innovation Beyond its core lending services, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rolling out an overcollateralized stablecoin backed by on-chain reserves. Designed to maintain price stability, this asset will streamline borrowing processes and enhance trust in the ecosystem. As decentralized finance platforms increasingly rely on stablecoins for transactions, Mutuum’s integration positions it to capture a larger share of this booming market. The project further distinguishes itself with a buy-and-distribute mechanism. A percentage of platform fees will automatically purchase MUTM tokens from the open market, redistributing them to stakers. This system creates continuous buying pressure, directly linking platform activity to token value appreciation. Combined with plans to launch a beta version of its platform alongside exchange listings, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is engineering conditions for sustained growth long after its presale concludes. Presale Momentum Builds Rapidly Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has strategically priced its presale to reward early participants. Phase One offers tokens at $0.01. At launch, the token will list at $0.06, locking in a 600% gain for Phase One buyers. With over half of the initial allocation already claimed, the window for securing tokens at this entry point is narrowing quickly. Historical patterns in the crypto market show that projects launching with functional platforms see sharper price increases post-listing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is following this blueprint, ensuring its beta lending platform goes live simultaneously with exchange listings. This operational readiness is critica. It allows immediate user adoption, driving transaction volume and liquidity from day one. To accelerate community growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is allocating $100,000 to a giveaway split among ten participants. The campaign, detailed on the project’s official channels, requires simple social media engagement. Such initiatives not only reward early supporters but also amplify visibility, drawing more investors to the presale before Phase One closes. Crypto analysts are unanimous; tokens with clear utility and built-in demand drivers outperform speculative assets during bull markets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) checks both boxes. Its lending platform solves real problems for DeFi users, while its tokenomics create scarcity through buybacks and staking rewards. Experts point to these factors when forecasting a rise to $1 in 2025, a 100x leap from the current presale price.

The choice of the best altcoin to buy in the U.S. usually involves a very close understanding of the trends in the market, new innovations, and their long-term prospects. For example, according to CoinMarketCap, Solana (SOL) is trading at $191.91 , with a 2.84% decrease in the last 24 hours. Dogecoin (DOGE) stands at $0.251 , down 3.22%, and Ethereum (ETH) trades at $2,627 , dropping by 2.89%. With such fluctuations, investors need to focus on tokens that offer stability, utility, and excellent future promise. Why the Market is Shifting Towards Smarter Investments An altcoin entered the U.S. market with uninterrupted DeFi solutions. The platform adapted to changing regulations, ensuring compliance and user trust at all times. Consequently, its rise indicated the dawn of a new era for decentralized finance. Investors seek platforms offering real-world utilities and adopt projects incorporating AI, automation, and financial tools. One such project making waves is RCO Finance (RCOF) , which is making a strong claim as the best altcoin to buy. Most altcoins use only hype, but RCOF combines AI-powered trading and real-world asset investment with a seamless DeFi experience. Central to its design is its AI-based Robo Advisor, which gives it an edge with intelligent investment insights drafted specifically for each user’s portfolio. In 2021, Squid Game Token (SQUID), inspired by the popular Netflix series, skyrocketed to over $2,800 before crashing to nearly zero in days, leaving investors with significant losses. The Robo Advisor could have flagged early signs, such as large withdrawals and alarming reductions in reserves for stakeholders to exit before the crash, reducing investors’ exposure to risk. RCOF: A Smarter Way to Trade and Invest RCO Finance is changing the entire paradigm of investment strategies by providing access to more than 120,000 assets within 12,500 asset classes, including stocks, bonds, and tokenized real-world assets like real estate, wallets, and commodities. This makes sure that crypto investors diversify away from conventional crypto trading. It also offers automated market-making, providing liquidity while rewarding users on DEXs. This provision entails users’ active participation in the DeFi ecosystem by joining liquidity pools to earn returns. With RCO Finance, up to 1000x leverage is available, allowing maximum returns with little capital across many asset classes. Such high-leverage provision is rare, once again solidifying RCOF’s position as the best altcoin to buy now. The Altcoin Fueling the Future of DeFi Private Syndicate ETF Funds offered by RCO Finance permit investors to consolidate their finance in diversified ETFs across numerous asset classes. Hence, crypto investors can reap the benefits from the constant proven strength of ETFs. Additionally, it uses a non-KYC model, which guarantees privacy and anonymity to users. This ensures that users can access decentralized finance products without going through verification processes. Asset purchases using cryptocurrencies can also be made via this platform, allowing investments in stocks, bonds, and real estate. An audit by SolidProof has been carried out on RCO Finance and is a mark of assurance for smart contracts and risks of exploit minimization. Consequently, investors feel secure that their funds are safe while remaining confident in RCOF. RCO Finance has also launched its Beta platform , where its users can test what the next cutting-edge functionalities would look like. Over 10,000 users have joined to test the ecosystem and give valuable feedback. Seize the Opportunity and Invest in RCO Finance Today Having sold over 13 million tokens, analysts believe the token could launch even higher than the projected $0.6, generating massive returns for early investors. Currently, RCOF is in the presale stage at the price of $0.10, which is expected to go up by 30% to $0.13 in the next stage. This makes it the best altcoin to buy right now, offering a golden opportunity to invest before the price surges! If you invest $1,000 today, you could get $70,000 profit post-listing. Don’t miss this opportunity to become part of the finance revolution. The platform also recently announced a giveaway of $100,000, with early investors able to take part in this massive offer. For those who missed out on early Solana (SOL) or Ethereum (ETH) investments, this is another chance to be a part of something equally, if not more revolutionary.

Web3Bay’s DAO Redefines E-Commerce – Explosive Presale Growth Expected!",https://thecoinrise.com/cast-your-vote-shape-your-market-web3bays-dao-redefines-e-commerce-explosive-presale-growth-expected/,"Today’s e-commerce giants like Amazon and eBay operate under a top-heavy, centralized framework that dictates policies and fees, leaving little room for user input. Enter Web3Bay, a game changer in online shopping that empowers its community through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This pioneering approach hands the reins of control back to the users. A DAO operates on a blockchain framework where decisions are democratically made by token holders, not a central figure. Ownership of Web3Bay ’s 3BAY token provides a ticket to this democratic process, allowing users to vote on key matters such as fee structures, platform updates, seller regulations, and security enhancements. By removing middlemen and enabling community-driven decisions, Web3Bay is creating an open and accountable ecosystem. This shift ensures that the platform evolves according to the needs and wants of its actual users, rather than the financial agendas of distant executives. Web3Bay Presale Success & Market Dynamics Web3Bay’s initial token offering is quickly gaining momentum, reflecting strong market faith in its revolutionary model. As of February 17, 2025, the initiative has amassed over $1.4 million, with more than 360 million tokens distributed at $0.004562625 each. This robust engagement underscores the market’s appetite for decentralized e-commerce solutions. Spanning 28 stages, the presale sees a consistent 15% hike in token price per stage. Now at Stage 4, each 3BAY token stands at $0.004562, anticipated to soar to $0.1959 by launch. This structured price ascent offers early backers substantial potential gains, mirroring the trajectories of previously successful blockchain projects. Unlike typical blockchain marketplaces focused solely on NFT transactions, such as OpenSea and Rarible, Web3Bay integrates DAO into everyday e-commerce. It allows its community to dictate everything from fees to seller standards and conflict resolution, marking a rare but significant stride in the industry and solidifying its competitive edge. Why Web3Bay’s DAO Model Is Transformative for E-Commerce Decentralized governance through DAO offers several transformative advantages for the e-commerce sector: Transparency & Trust : Each decision is immutably recorded on the blockchain, ensuring clarity and fairness in governance, free from manipulation. Community-Driven Rules : The platform adapts through community consensus rather than top-down mandates, reflecting the true needs and preferences of its users. Reduced Costs & Equitable Transactions : By cutting out traditional operational overheads and decentralizing control, Web3Bay minimizes fees and fosters fair trade practices. Enhanced Security with Smart Contracts : Automated escrow systems bolster transaction security, safeguarding against common e-commerce risks such as fraud and counterfeit listings. Web3Bay’s commitment to a DAO-based model resonates with the broader move toward decentralization seen across various sectors. Successful DAOs like Uniswap and MakerDAO have demonstrated the efficacy of governance tokens in balancing user empowerment with operational efficiency. By adopting this governance model, Web3Bay is not just participating in the market—it’s redefining the rules of engagement for the digital marketplace. With a thriving presale and a robust, community-first governance structure, Web3Bay is poised to lead the charge in the new wave of decentralized retail. As blockchain technology becomes more mainstream, the evolution towards user-managed marketplaces seems destined. Web3Bay isn’t merely launching another e-commerce platform; it’s pioneering an era of equitable, transparent, and community-focused shopping.

Nigerian Lawmaker Denies Crypto Ties, Sues for Defamation According to a local news outlet , Agbese is seeking a declaration that Gambaryan’s statements were defamatory, an order preventing him from making further claims, and a public retraction of the allegations. He also demands ₦1 billion in general damages and an additional ₦5 million to cover legal expenses. The controversy stems from social media posts in which Gambaryan accused Agbese and two other legislators of attempting to secure a $150 million bribe through cryptocurrency transactions. The claims quickly gained traction online and were widely reported by Nigerian media outlets, including Channels Television and Blueprint.

The lawsuit asserts that Agbese has never owned a cryptocurrency account or engaged in digital currency transactions. In addition to financial compensation, the lawsuit demands that Gambaryan issue a public apology in at least three national newspapers and remove all social media posts containing the allegations. The suit also seeks a court injunction to prevent further dissemination of the claims. The Nigerian government has also intervened in the matter. On February 14, 2025, the Minister of Information and National Orientation dismissed Gambaryan’s accusations, stating that no credible evidence had been presented to support them.

Binance Exec Tigran Gambaryan Freed After Months in Nigerian Detention Tigran Gambaryan, a Binance executive specializing in financial crime compliance, was arrested in Nigeria in February 2024 on money laundering charges during a business trip. His colleague, Nadeem Anjarwalla, managed to escape to Kenya , but Gambaryan remained detained at Kuje Correctional Center. Binance has consistently denied wrongdoing and called for his release, arguing that he was not a company decision-maker. The exchange also alleged that Nigerian officials requested a secret payment to resolve the issue, a claim the Nigerian government denies .

His detention led to severe health complications, including pneumonia, malaria, and a herniated disk that left him reliant on crutches. Despite medical reports recommending surgery, his requests for medical attention were repeatedly denied . The court ordered Gambaryan to pay a $2,000 fine for overstaying his visa before returning to the U.S . Despite all these legal attacks, Binance continues to dispute these allegations and is engaging with Nigerian officials to resolve the matter. Looking forward, the court has ordered Gambaryan to respond to its new lawsuit within eight days. Notices will be served through Nigerian media or his legal team. If he fails to respond, the court may proceed in his absence. Crypto, Politics, and Defamation: A Nigerian Court Showdown The legal clash between Nigerian lawmaker Philip Agbese and Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan highlights tensions between politics and the crypto industry. Agbese has filed a ₦1 billion defamation suit, asserting that false claims of a bribery attempt have harmed his public image. Meanwhile, Gambaryan—previously cleared of money laundering charges—now faces another court challenge. This dispute reflects Nigeria’s struggle to regulate cryptocurrencies while balancing innovation and accountability. As the proceedings continue, the ruling may not only settle a personal dispute but also redefine accountability for both public figures and crypto companies, setting a precedent for how weighty online claims are addressed in a digital society.

It is experiencing a tolerable 2% weekly loss as cautious traders reduce yields, volatility, and market turnovers to new lows. During the K33 report launch , the head of research, Vetle Lunde, indicated that the pro-crypto administration headed by President Trump had a long-term positive effect on Bitcoin and the entire industry. However, there is a short-term uncertainty that makes the market lethargic. Lunde said in a report on Tuesday: Bitcoin metrics are softening across all corners of the market. Volumes, yields, options premiums, and ETF flows have moved to areas not seen since before the election. Alongside these lethargic conditions, volatilities have plunged to multi-month lows. Vetle Lunde While comparing Bitcoin’s volatility to the top 100 U.S. companies, Lunde said that 37% of the firms currently show higher 30-day volatility than Bitcoin. Such crazy levels were last seen in October 2023. He further pointed out that periods of low volatility are temporary and rarely last longer; therefore, traders must be ready for a sudden shift. Low premiums are indications of weaker market performance The research further indicated that CME Bitcoin Futures shows premiums have recently dropped past 5%, a rare occurrence. The data from 2021 to 2025 shows that low premiums always coincide with weaker market performance. In futures trading, the basis refers to the difference between an asset’s futures and spot prices. A premium occurs when futures prices exceed spot prices, often signaling bullish sentiment, while a discount suggests bearish conditions. Lunde insists that Bitcoin always performs better in a strong basis regime and asks traders to be cautious during the current market uncertainty. The short-term time frame shows that the $BTC price continues to roll over after breaking through the top of the descending wedge. If this downtrend continues, the next horizontal support is $94,000, and the bottom range is $92,000. Just below this is the major ascending trendline that stretches back to the 2021 bull market. Bitcoin price remains uncertain, but the potential of an uptrend is still intact on the week A keen look at the weekly $BTC chart reveals how the prices have gone sideways over extended periods in the current bull market. The position is very healthy and will probably lead to a higher top than if the price keeps climbing. Looking at this chart, the bear might say that an M-top chart pattern may be playing out. Of course, this is always a possibility. However, the trend is still upward until the price falls and confirms below the current range, the bottom of which is bolstered by the ascending trendline. At the foot of the chart, the Stochastic RSI, which highlights price strength, has its indicators hitting the lowest point. If they turn back and climb over the 20.00 level, the renewed upward price force can push $BTC from its current range to the next new level. This will likely begin taking place in less than a month.

Macro Set-Up For Bitcoin And Ethereum Surge While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana face a downtrend due to rising volatility, Pal remains steadfast in his optimistic projection, believing that the market is in the greatest macro target of all time. The Real Vision CEO shared a series of thread posts on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting technical indicators and macro factors that would positively influence Bitcoin and Ethereum’s price trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forms Double Bottom After Crash, Is A Bounce To $112,000 ATH Possible? Sharing a logarithmic weekly chart of Bitcoin, Pal indicated that Bitcoin had experienced a long-term price uptrend line since 2020, showing a distinct pattern of higher lows. Currently, Bitcoin is moving within a tight trading range, which Pal believes could be bullish, as a strong break above the resistance line could trigger a major run. Similarly, the Real Vision Co-founder presented a price chart of Ethereum, highlighting that ETH is currently consolidated within a symmetrical triangle, signaling the potential for a price breakout. Typically, a symmetrical triangle pattern is seen as a bullish signal for ETH, but considering its recent underperformance compared to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana, a strong bullish breakout remains skeptical. Looking at the symmetrical triangle, a breakout from the upper trendline could see the Ethereum price skyrocketing to $4,000 or even higher based on Pal’s chart. Additionally, the Solana price, which has been seeing varying momentum lately, has tested a key horizontal resistance multiple times, forming a strong accumulation base. Historically such consolidation phases tend to precede explosive rallies, provided that broader market trends remain favorable. In his post, Pal encourages traders to “zoom out” , likely suggesting a shift from short-term fluctuations to long term cycles. He warned against excessive leverage and risk-taking to avoid liquidation in volatile conditions. He also urges traders to remain patient, watching how the market unfolds and preparing ahead of a potential bullish surge. Market Volatility Raises Fear In his analysis, Pal suggested that the broader crypto market is currently plagued by fear and panic, as volatility rises and crypto prices experience a downtrend. He explains that a significant portion of crypto investors or traders are currently bearish.

Due to this market change, many in the market had sold off their tokens to avoid further losses. Despite this bearish trend, Pal maintains an optimistic outlook, expecting a strong surge for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.

Tether co-founder Reeve Collins is now the chairman and co-founder of Pi Protocol, the maker of a new USDT competitor, USP, Bloomberg reports . The Pi stablecoin is scheduled to roll out on the Solana ( SOL ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchains later this year. Pi aims to use smart contracts to execute transactions and mint the USP stablecoin, which aims to be backed by bonds and other yield-bearing real-world assets. The project aims to be more decentralized than other stablecoin projects, such as Tether’s USDT, giving users a larger piece of the pie, according to the report. Says Collins on the new stablecoin, “I very much supported Tether over the years, it’s an extraordinary invention that we’ve developed… We view Pi Protocol as the evolution of stablecoins. Tether has been extremely successful in showcasing demand for stablecoins. But they keep all the yield. We believe 10 years later the market is really ready to evolve.” Says Pi CEO Bundeep Singh Rangar of the new crypto project, “You want assets that are non-correlated to crypto that are mid- to high yield, low risk. We have a mechanism that assesses the quality of the asset. They are ones that are vetted on their loss ratio and origination of where they are coming from.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Catzilla, a rising Solana-based meme coin, is making waves and positioning itself as a potential challenger to Litecoin and Polkadot. Table of Contents Catzilla: The monstrous meme coin Why Catzilla could be the next crypto heavyweight Conclusion The crypto market is buzzing with a potential new star on the horizon. Catzilla, a promising Solana-based project, is gaining attention for its growth potential. With the current bull run in full swing, enthusiasts are speculating whether this newcomer can challenge established giants like Litecoin (LTC) and Polkadot (DOT). Catzilla: The monstrous meme coin In the ever-chaotic meme coin battleground, Catzilla emerges as a behemoth ready to demolish the status quo. Unlike the usual dog-themed tokens that flood the market, Catzilla introduces an entirely new narrative — an unstoppable kaiju-cat storming through the crypto scene with fiery ambition. Inspired by the legendary appeal of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe, this token blends meme culture with real financial opportunity. What sets Catzilla apart isn’t just its name — it’s the movement it represents. This Solana-based sensation fuses anime aesthetics, gaming mechanics, and a decentralized vision to create a new kind of meme token experience. With a rebellious edge and a commitment to financial freedom, Catzilla is uniting crypto enthusiasts, gamers, and meme lovers in a battle against outdated financial systems. Why Catzilla stands out: Massive ROI potential: Catzilla’s presale features 14 stages, allowing early investors to capitalize on a rise from $0.0002 to $0.0016 — a massive 700% increase before its official launch. Game-changing narrative: While most meme coins focus solely on hype, Catzilla weaves an immersive kaiju-inspired storyline, giving the community a reason to rally beyond mere speculation. Triple utility model: Catzilla isn’t just a meme — it offers value through gameplay integration, a powerful community movement, and a fun yet lucrative crypto ecosystem. More than just another meme coin, Catzilla is here to redefine what it means to be a digital asset in the modern market.

The project offers a hybrid model that taps into multiple lucrative crypto sectors. Its threefold strategy — combining meme-driven virality, interactive gaming elements, and a decentralized mission — positions it as a force to be reckoned with. More than a payment coin: Litecoin’s appeal lies in its efficiency for transactions. Catzilla expands beyond payments by integrating gaming incentives and DeFi opportunities. Beyond interoperability: Polkadot enhances blockchain connectivity. On the other hand, Catzilla fosters community engagement and reward-driven ecosystems. Massive growth potential: With a presale offering up to 700% ROI, Catzilla’s early-stage opportunity challenges the stagnation seen in older altcoins. By embracing innovation while staying true to the playful spirit of meme coins, Catzilla isn’t just entering the arena — it’s redefining it. As the crypto market shifts towards high-engagement assets, Catzilla has the potential to outpace traditional altcoins and cement itself as a leader in the next wave of blockchain growth. Conclusion While Litecoin and Polkadot show less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as a meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom. Offering a 700% ROI during its presale — from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages — Catzilla’s triple utility empowers holders and unites them to join the fight against crypto villains.

The newly acquired licenses will allow LTP HK to deal in securities and futures contracts, advise on securities and futures contracts, and manage assets. LTP HK became the first prime brokerage focused on virtual assets to secure a comprehensive suite of HK SFC licenses. LTP announced today that its subsidiary LTP HK had secured types 1, 2, 4, 5, and 9 licenses from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (HK SFC). LTP HK became the first prime brokerage to deal in securities and futures contracts, advise on securities and futures contracts, and manage assets. LTP disclosed that LTP HK was now licensed to offer a range of financial services to institutional clients, including proprietary trading firms, hedge funds, asset managers, and corporate investors. According to LTP, the regulatory achievement solidified LTP HK’s credibility and leadership within the dynamic financial services landscape. Jack Young, the founder and CEO of LTP, said regulatory compliance was the ‘fundamental pillar’ of the firm’s institutional prime brokerage services. He added that LTP was committed to serving institutional clients who demanded secure high-performance trading infrastructure. LTP HK increases its financial service offerings with new HK SFC licenses LTP announced that its Hong Kong subsidiary, LTP HK, had gained approval for a type 1 HK SFC license, which allowed the company to deal in securities. LTP HK also received type 2 licensing, allowing it to deal in futures contracts. Types 4 and 5 licenses authorized LTP HK to advise on securities and futures contracts, respectively. The type 9 SFC license allowed LTP HK to engage in regulated asset management. HK SFC recently announced its swift licensing process and revamped the second phase of its assessment of virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs). The agency disclosed that its proactive engagement and enhanced communication with VATPs to provide direct and effective guidance on its expected regulatory standards were key to the swift licensing process. LTP stated that the LTP HK’s approvals from the HK SFC aligned with the company’s commitment to regulatory compliance, institutional-grade services offering, and investor protection. “This regulatory milestone marks a strategic leap forward in our mission to bridge traditional finance with digital asset innovation.” -Ethan Wang, CEO of LiquidityTech Limited (LTP HK) Wang added that LTP HK was set to empower institutions with compliant customer-protected solutions that drove growth in evolving markets as Hong Kong cemented ‘its role as a global hub for financial innovation.’ The HK SFC had earlier identified various deficiencies and substandard conduct during the course of its supervision of licensed corporations engaged in asset management. Hong Kong SFC streamlines licenses for virtual asset managers The HK SFC recently published a circular detailing a new streamlined licensing process that now applies to all new applicants for a virtual asset trading platform (VATP) license. The single external assessment conducted after the applicant had implemented all its internal systems and controls replaced the two-phased external assessment previously required. Previously, applicants for virtual asset trading platform licenses–under the HK SFC’s Scope of External Assessment Reports published in June 2023–were required to engage an external assessor to submit two assessment reports to the SFC. The phase 1 report was submitted with the license application, and the effectiveness of the design of the license applicant’s proposed policies was assessed. The phase 2 report was submitted by an external assessor after the SFC granted approval-in-principle of the virtual asset trading platform license application and assessed the effectiveness of the policies, procedures, and the systems and controls actually implemented. External assessors are required to submit only one assessment report under the new streamlined licensing process. HK SFC confirmed that assessment was required to ensure that a VATP applicant’s systems and controls, policies, and procedures were suitably designed and implemented to meet the requirements of the SFC’s VATP and AML/CFT guidelines. The circular contained no details of the required terms of reference, scope, and specific areas to be covered by the single assessment report. According to the HK SFC, these details were available in the now defunct Scope of External Assessment Reports.",Press Release,EN,0,0,ASIA|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-18 23:04:00

40517288,https://coingape.com/?p=239683,1739920676,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Bitwise Donates To Open Source Bitcoin Development Amid Market Downturn,https://coingape.com/bitwise-donates-to-open-source-bitcoin-development/,"Asset management firm Bitwise has unveiled a new donation to support open-source innovation of the Bitcoin network. According to the firm’s update, this latest donation aligns with its promise to give back after its Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ($BITB) launch in January 2024. Bitwise Aim to Boost Bitcoin Development At the time, Bitwise hinted at its plan to give 10% of its gross profits each year to charity. In a recent development, the asset manager announced the donation, saying it is finally fulfilling its promise to the public. Bitwise revealed on X that it will donate $150,000 to support Bitcoin’s open-source developers. The fund is designed to encourage developers who work tirelessly to secure and maintain the Bitcoin network. This is the first annual donation since the promise was made. Bitwise intends to allocate the funds to three non-profit organizations: Bitcoin Brink, Open Sats, and the Human Rights Foundation (HRF). It believes these entities already have established track records within the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. “Thank you to the investors who’ve chosen Bitwise and BITB among many options. This donation is made possible because of your choice. We hope you’re as proud as we are to support Bitcoin open-source developers,” Bitwise wrote on X. The Donation Rationale Significantly, this donation may trigger increased participation from developers as it promotes innovation and ensures the security of blockchain technology. Markedly, these open-source developers are crucial to the health status of the Bitcoin blockchain and, by extension, the broader crypto sector. The asset manager believes a donation of $150,000 could attract more talent into the ecosystem. Moreover, this funding positions Bitwise as a firm with futuristic goals and community links. This donation could also attract goodwill to the Bitcoin ETF issuer. Just like it does for Bitcoin, Bitwise also has staking pools, which is its way of supporting the Ethereum ecosystem, which also has ETF ties. The Bitwise Donation Timing Bitwise’s move coincides with the season in which the crypto sector is receiving more favorable policies. Several firms are submitting applications to list multiple crypto ETFs. They are encouraged by the improved trajectory of the crypto sector under President Donald Trump. Even Bitwise filed to list spot XRP ETF weeks ago. The US SEC has acknowledged this XRP ETF filing , officially kickstarting the countdown for the approval The Commission had earlier acknowledged a similar filing from 21Shares a week ago. Through the crypto task force , many are positive the filing will gain approval amid broad rules review.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Solana stalls, attention is shifting to Rollblock for its massive growth potential. Table of Contents Rollblock poised for 100x rally Is Solana facing another correction? Conclusion As the crypto market shifts between uncertainty and opportunity, investors are eagerly searching for the next 100x contender. While Solana (SOL) struggles to reclaim its January highs, a rising star is capturing market attention. Rollblock’s GameFi ecosystem, security, and staking model have helped it raise over $10 million in record time. Rollblock poised for 100x rally Rollblock is emerging as a power player in the $500 billion online casino market. Boasting more than 7,000 AI-powered games and a rapidly growing sports prediction league, Rollblock has already witnessed a 600% uptick in new registrations. As the project continues to dominate the altcoin market during its presale, analysts are projecting returns of up to 880% for early RBLK adopters. Unlike traditional gaming platforms, Rollblock incorporates both traditional and digital finance. Players can top up their accounts using 20+ compatible cryptocurrencies by connecting their wallets or deposit fiat currency via Google Pay, Apple Pay, or MasterCard. Rollblock is also committed to user security through its Ethereum-backed security system. All wagers are automatically encrypted on-chain, making it impossible to alter bets after they are placed. Rollblock’s smart contract has passed a SolidProof audit, ensuring that there are no secret back doors for hackers to exploit. You might also like: Coinbase files papers to list SOL; experts notice whales’ continued support for Rollblock Rollblock further sets itself apart from the competition with its native RBLK token. Investors can secure rewards of up to 30% APYs by adding RBLK to staking pools. With the revenue-sharing model, Rollblock will use up to 30% of its weekly revenue to make open market buybacks of RBLK and distribute 40% of these to holders as rewards. The remaining 60% will be permanently removed from RBLK’s supply, creating scarcity and putting deflationary pressure on the price. Currently, RBLK is in stage 10 of its presale with tokens selling for $0.055. Since Rollblock’s supply is capped at one billion tokens, analysts expect a massive 100x accumulation rally once RBLK is listed on major exchange platforms. Is Solana facing another correction? Solana’s price has remained volatile throughout 2025 after it reached an all-time high of $294 on January 19. Following the rally, a huge meme coin selloff pushed its price below $200. Although Solana’s price action paints a bearish picture, SOL’s Open Interest has surged to $3.3 billion. This recent spike suggests that increased capital is entering Solana’s contracts, potentially setting the stage for a recovery. Another optimistic metric is Solana’s Sharpe ratio which has recently increased to 0.48, suggesting that returns outweigh the associated risk at current prices. Solana is currently selling at $1678.35 following an intraday decline of 5.90%. The altcoin is still trading below several of its Exponential Moving Averages on the daily chart. With the MACD in a bearish crossover, analysts expect more volatility for Solana in the coming weeks.

After a slow initial rollout approximately four months ago, Bloomberg reports that the platform has sold over 24 billion of its WLFI tokens, representing more than 96% of its total supply. As it stands, fewer than 1 billion tokens remain available for sale. World Liberty Financial Token Sale Sparks Debate The World Liberty Financial token, priced at 5 cents each, is part of a broader initiative aimed at raising $300 million at a $1.5 billion valuation. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Faces Renewed Pressure—Is a Breakdown Imminent? The project launched its token sale in mid-October, with the intention of enabling token holders to propose changes to the platform and vote on others’ proposals. However, the limited rights associated with the WLFI tokens have raised concerns. Holders possess minimal voting rights and no economic entitlements, and the tokens cannot be traded or sold back to World Liberty, prompting questions about their long-term value and utility. Adding to the intrigue surrounding World Liberty Financial, crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun, founder of the TRON blockchain, recently disclosed a substantial investment of $45 million into the venture. This increased Justin Sun’s total stake in World Liberty Financial to $75 million, indicating strong confidence in the platform’s potential. TRUMP And MELANIA Tokens Experience Wild Price Fluctuations Analysts are speculating that forthcoming executive orders from Trump could positively influence the cryptocurrency landscape in the US, yet skepticism remains among industry veterans. Nic Carter, a venture capitalist, expressed concerns regarding the ethical implications of a sitting president engaging in business ventures that may present conflicts of interest. The launch of Trump’s memecoins has also stirred significant controversy. As previously reported by NewsBTC, the Donald Trump memecoin (TRUMP) saw a sharp decline, dropping from a weekend high of $75 to $17. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Bulls in Action—Is a New Upside Run Beginning? Similarly, the Melania Trump memecoin (MELANIA) disrupted the market with increased excitement among crypto investors, with its value fluctuating dramatically from a high of $13.64 to its current trading price of $1.26. Bernstein analysts have characterized this period as a “chaotic crypto era,” suggesting that government involvement with cryptocurrencies could redefine the relationship between leadership and emerging technologies. They argue that the launches of Trump and Melania’s memecoins could signal a potential regulatory shift, positioning digital assets as a direct link to a wider audience. While trading at $17, TRUMP is posting significant losses of 6%, 2% and 70% in the 24 hour, fourteen day and monthly time frames respectively, coupled with a 27% drop in trading volume, according to CoinGecko data.

The company announced on Tuesday that it is raising $2 billion in 0% convertible senior notes to buy more Bitcoin, betting even bigger on the long-term value of its holdings. The debt offering, open only to qualified institutional buyers, includes an option to raise an extra $300 million if demand is high. The notes mature in 2030, won’t pay interest, and won’t increase in value over time, according to Strategy’s announcement. Investors can convert them into cash or shares of Strategy’s stock, depending on what the company decides. The notes are redeemable starting in 2027, but only if Strategy’s stock price surpasses 130% of the conversion price for a set period. If that happens, Strategy can buy back the notes at face value plus any special interest owed, per the announcement . If Strategy faces a fundamental change, such as a major acquisition or restructuring, investors can demand repayment on March 1, 2028. The conversion rate and final terms will be determined at pricing, based on Strategy’s stock performance on the day the deal is finalized. Bitcoin acquisition and debt strategy Strategy has been using debt to buy Bitcoin for years, and this latest one actually follows a pattern: raise cash, buy Bitcoin, and wait for the price to rise. The company plans to use the $2 billion for general corporate expenses, but its real focus is accumulating more Bitcoin. In 2024, Strategy bought 258,320 BTC for $22.07 billion, paying an average of $85,447 per Bitcoin, including fees. The company didn’t sell a single Bitcoin, despite price fluctuations. As of December 31, 2024, Strategy held 447,470 BTC, valued at $23.9 billion. But its outstanding debt hit $7.27 billion, with $35.1 million in annual interest costs. The company posted a net loss for 2024, mostly due to $1.79 billion in Bitcoin impairment losses. If Bitcoin’s market price crashes, Strategy’s ability to meet financial obligations could be at risk. The company warned in a 10-K SEC filing that it “may not be able to regain profitability” if Bitcoin’s fair value continues to drop. Strategy has been dealing with old accounting rules that force companies to write down Bitcoin losses, but never adjust gains unless sold. That changes in January 2025 with new FASB fair-value accounting rules. Gains and losses will now be recorded in net income each quarter, creating massive fluctuations in reported profits. The new rules will immediately apply a $12.75 billion adjustment to Strategy’s retained earnings. But there’s a catch: tax liabilities could surge. The company warned that unrealized Bitcoin gains might trigger the 15% Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. “If we become subject to the CAMT, it could result in a material tax obligation that we would need to satisfy in cash,” Strategy said. The tax applies to companies with over $1 billion in annual adjusted financial income, and unless the law is amended, Strategy could owe huge taxes by 2026. The company also faces tax risks across multiple jurisdictions, with uncertainty around deferred tax assets and liabilities, as selling Bitcoin at higher prices than its cost basis will likely trigger some serious capital gains taxes. Strategy’s debt offering is private—only qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A can participate. The notes won’t be registered with the SEC and can’t be publicly sold without an exemption. Investors interested in the deal must attend a live webinar on February 19, 2025, where the company will go over terms, risks, and expectations. “Access to the Video Webinar and completion of the investor survey does not mean you will receive an allocation in this proposed convertible notes offering,” Strategy clarified today.

40517875,https://crypto.news/?p=14337994,1739921820,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/40517875.jpeg,Google to let users access their Bitcoin wallets via Google accounts,https://crypto.news/google-to-let-users-access-their-bitcoin-wallets-via-google-accounts/,"On Feb. 18, 2025, during Hong Kong Bitcoin Tech Carnival, Google web3 specialist Kyle Song revealed that Google is working to simplify the use of Bitcoin for Google users. According to Song, Google is “exploring ways to lower entry barriers so Web2 users can easily use Bitcoin.” Song said the company has been working on the integration of Bitcoin into its ecosystem for about a year since Bitcoin ETFs were approved by the SEC. Table of Contents Details revealed by Song Is this a huge news? The Bitcoin ETFs’ role Details revealed by Song Judging from what Song said, Google is preparing a really simple in-use solution that will seamlessly integrate cryptocurrencies into the Google ecosystem used by billions of people across the world. He said Bitcoin wallets will be embedded into the web2 interface so that users will be able to log into their BTC wallets using Google accounts. As for crypto payments, Google aims to make them as simple and intuitive as already existing web2 payment solutions. Another focus of the Google team is ensuring the security of their solution. They strive “to address trust issues between on-chain and off-chain systems.” To maintain stable, trustless functioning, Google is going to deploy Zero-Knowledge Proofs or similar encryption technologies. Is this a huge news? Although Song’s speech wasn’t a full-fledged announcement but rather a teaser, the project itself, if it plays out well, can propel Bitcoin’s adoption like nothing before did. Google is used by billions of users, many of whom have Google accounts. The way people perceive Bitcoin and crypto may change drastically if, one day, all of these people find out they have a seamless service within their Google account that allows them to purchase, exchange, or spend Bitcoin. If Bitcoin functionality is integrated with Google Pay, crypto may see an immense circulation boom. As people discover they have an easy and secure way to use crypto legally, they may start to explore new opportunities associated with this new class of assets. However, it’s important to keep in mind that sometimes ambitious plans set by top-tier companies fail, and it’s early to judge whether we are going to see this collaboration between Google and Bitcoin materialize or not. In 2020, two tech giants, Facebook and Telegram, had to withdraw their plans to deploy cryptocurrencies integrated into their services when it seemed that the projects were about to take off. Both companies survived and moved on. Eventually, Telegram started to support third-party crypto wallets in the form of mini-apps and bots. The wallets integrated into the messenger saw substantial traction, however, the service has its limitations and concerns while lacking serious promotion from Telegram itself. Will Google succeed in becoming the first high-profile company to implement crypto in its services seamlessly? The chances are higher as 2025 is way different than 2020, a year when Facebook and Telegram were about to launch their ambitious projects. Facebook Libra and Telegram Gram token projects didn’t come to fruition partly because they were set to launch in 2020 when the political and legislative environment was much more unfriendly towards crypto than now. More than that, crypto ETFs were not a thing in those days, making it even harder to bring crypto into web2 service. According to Gemini Exchange co-founder Cameron Winklevoss, the Facebook Libra killing was a politically motivated act . The Biden era was marked with Operation Choke Point 2.0, which denied banking services to various companies working with cryptocurrency, and the shutdown of Facebook Libra perfectly set the tone for the following years under Biden’s leadership and the Gensler-led SEC.

Ironically, it was Gensler who made it possible when he approved Bitcoin ETFs. The Bitcoin ETFs’ role Bitcoin ETF approval is widely viewed as a bridge connecting the crypto market and traditional investors. Bitcoin ETFs align with a clear legal framework while allowing its holders to benefit from the Bitcoin market value. ETFs helped big corporations to enter the crypto sector without having to deal with regulatory uncertainty. The fact that BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF IBIT became the fastest-growing asset in history proves that it’s approval was a transformational move.

The company recently submitted a proposal to acquire the remaining shares of Adecoagro, a major agribusiness and energy company. Tether Offers to Buy More Shares Tether is offering $12.41 per share, which, if approved, would increase its stake from 19.4% to 51%. This would make Tether the company’s majority owner, giving it control over its operations. This move further solidifies the stablecoin issuer’s expansion strategy beyond digital assets. Last September, the stablecoin issuer acquired a 9.8% stake in Adecoagro , which currently owns 19.4% of the agricultural company. On February 14, Tether offered $12.41 per share to buy the rest. If accepted, this would make Tether the majority owner. Adecoagro’s Board of Directors is carefully reviewing the proposal. On February 16, they brought in legal and financial experts to study the deal’s impact. After a full evaluation, a final decision will be made. Adecoagro’s Role in South American Agriculture and Energy Adecoagro is a major player in South America’s agricultural sector, managing over 210,400 hectares of farmland. The company produces more than 2.8 million tons of agricultural goods, including crops and dairy products. Additionally, it operates several industrial facilities and generates over 1 million megawatt-hours of renewable electricity annually. Thus, Adecoagro is a key food producer and an important contributor to the region’s energy sector. Tether’s interest in non-crypto industries is growing. If this deal goes through, it will give the stablecoin company control over a major agricultural and energy business in South America. This aligns with Tether’s broader strategy of diversifying its investments beyond digital assets. Tether’s Expanding Influence Beyond Stablecoins Tether is no longer just a stablecoin company. In the past year, it has invested in Bitcoin mining , artificial intelligence (AI), and even a football club. With this move into agribusiness, Tether is expanding its reach even further. At the same time, Tether’s flagship product, USDT, remains the largest in the market, with a value of over $140 billion. The company is also working with the government of Guinea to help the country with digital transformation, including using blockchain to support economic growth and innovation. A key part of this project is education. Tether is helping set up digital literacy programs in Guinea, teaching people about blockchain technology. The company also contributes to Guinea’s Innovation City project, which supports research and entrepreneurship.

BNB is currently priced at $646.51, reflecting a 0.33% increase over the past seven days. Despite a market cap decline of 3.26%, it still holds a strong valuation of $92.11 billion, with a 1.49% increase in 24-hour trading volume to $1.97 billion. Binance Coin’s long-term performance remains impressive, considering the staggering increase of over 672,878.62% from its all-time low of $0.09611 in January 2017.

The XRP price fall has raised concerns after Donald Trump’s revised tariff policies caused uncertainty, pushing the asset down 2.36%. Meanwhile, Dogecoin price resistance at $0.2655 continues to hinder its rebound despite multiple breakout attempts. However, BlockDAG (BDAG) is drawing significant attention as its 350% bonus offer nears its end. With $196 million already raised in its presale, BDAG’s price rises with every batch. The upcoming mainnet launch and predictions of a $1 price post-launch have made this bonus an opportunity for buyers aiming to multiply their holdings before BDAG’s next big move. XRP Price Falls as Markets React to New Trade Policies The XRP price fall has worsened after former U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest tariff announcements shook the financial markets. XRP dropped 2.36% in the past 24 hours to $2.43 as traders responded to the 25% tariff on steel imports and additional aluminum levies. The change in trade policies created a risk-off environment, leading market participants to exit speculative assets, including cryptocurrencies. Analysts are watching XRP closely, with $2.25 identified as a critical support level. Should the selling pressure persist, the XRP price fall could intensify, potentially driving it down to $2.00 and adding more market uncertainty. Dogecoin Price Resistance at $0.2655 Blocks Further Gains Dogecoin price resistance remains a key obstacle as the asset tries to recover above $0.250. After briefly dipping to $0.2388, DOGE regained some strength, climbing above a bearish trend line and surpassing the 100-hourly simple moving average. Despite this, strong resistance at $0.260 and $0.2655 is holding back its progress. If DOGE breaks through these levels, it could aim for $0.2725 and possibly reach $0.300 in the near term. However, failing to overcome the Dogecoin price resistance could result in a drop toward $0.2520 or even $0.2380, keeping traders cautious. BlockDAG’s 350% Bonus Ends Soon—A Limited Window to Expand Holdings BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700 bonus is in its last phase, giving buyers a limited-time chance to secure a 350% BDAG bonus before prices climb higher. For instance, a $5,000 purchase now delivers an extra $17,500 worth of BDAG, offering a rare chance to grow holdings instantly. With each presale batch increasing the price, this timing has become crucial. The presale has already raised $196 million, selling over 18.5 billion BDAG coins, showing strong market confidence. Since its launch, BDAG’s price has surged 2380% from $0.001 to $0.0248, making it one of the fastest-growing projects in the market. Each presale round is selling out faster than the previous one, and BDAG is expected to hit its $600 million target soon. Analysts consider BDAG one of the top crypto picks, with early buyers positioning for potentially significant long-term returns. BDAG’s real turning point will be its 2025 mainnet launch. Once live, the network’s utility will expand, driving up demand and strengthening its long-term prospects. Analysts are already predicting a $1 price for BDAG post-launch, highlighting the strong growth potential. As the ecosystem grows, BDAG’s value becomes clearer, and early accumulation is likely to pay off well. The project’s path toward wider adoption makes it one of the top crypto picks, with a promising future once the blockchain is fully operational. Final Say! As market dynamics shift, each of these assets faces a pivotal phase. XRP price fall remains a concern as new trade policies increase volatility, prompting traders to monitor key support levels. Dogecoin price resistance at $0.2655 continues to block its recovery, with a breakout being crucial for further gains. On the other hand, BlockDAG stands out as its 350% bonus offer is nearing its final stage. With $196 million raised and a 2380% price surge since batch 1, BDAG’s momentum is undeniable. A 2025 mainnet launch and a $1 price prediction put it among the top crypto picks of today.

In contrast, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is emerging as a game-changer, offering a smarter, AI-driven alternative with real utility. Analysts predict a 400% surge in the next three days, making it one of the most promising investment opportunities in the market. While the Shiba Inu price continues to battle whale sell-outs, WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents a more stable and profitable path, thanks to its ongoing presale, where tokens are currently priced at $0.0420 . With a price increase imminent and its official launch approaching, this project is positioned to outshine the Shiba Inu price, offering investors the chance to capitalize on its early-stage growth before it takes off. Whale Movements Continue To Squeeze Shiba Inu Price Currently priced at $0.000016, the Shiba Inu price has managed a slight recovery after massive whale transfers, climbing 1.3% in the last 24 hours and 3.4% over the past week. However, a closer look at the Shiba Inu price’s 30-day performance, which dropped 23.8%, paints a different picture. These fluctuations happen because whales accumulate when the Shiba Inu price is low and dump their holdings at higher levels, leaving retail investors to bear the brunt of the impact. As these investors seek more stable investments without whales’ influence, a new player is capturing their attention: WallitIQ (WLTQ). This project offers an alternative that combines AI-driven crypto management, near-zero transaction fees , and lucrative staking rewards (up to 180% APY ). Unlike the Shiba Inu price, which relies heavily on meme culture and community speculation, this altcoin positions itself as a utility-based token with tangible benefits. Here’s Why Analysts Say WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Surge By 400% In Three Days While the Shiba Inu price remains in a loop due to whale activities, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is gaining massive traction. Its presale is selling out rapidly as investors rush to secure their tokens at $0.0420 . The next presale stage will increase the price to $0.0620, and top exchange listings are on the way. Based on these developments, this project could see a 400% surge in value in the next few days. Beyond its booming presale , WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) well-structured tokenomics and real-world use cases give it a competitive edge over traditional cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu. With 45% of its supply allocated to public sales, 20% reserved for referral, airdrops and other community bonuses , and 15% dedicated to exchange liquidity, the project is designed for sustainable long-term growth. Unlike speculative meme coins, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is designed for utility-driven adoption. It allows users to pay for their everyday goods using crypto. Through its MVP build, this platform offers users access to AI-powered market insights and several sophisticated trading tools for smarter trading decisions, equipping them with all they need to maximize their profit potential. While the cryptocurrency space remains vulnerable to hacks and malicious smart contracts, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has undergone extensive audits by SolidProof, guaranteeing its reliability and integrity. With other security features such as biometric authentication, AI-driven anomaly detection, and AES & ECC encryption protocols, it further solidifies its reputation as a safe investment. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) platform empowers both retail and whale investors to take advantage of the volatile market. With exchange listings imminent, the WLTQ token price is expected to surpass its presale valuation. Analysts believe that once the upcoming beta platform goes live and early adopters begin testing the platform’s advanced features, demand will skyrocket, fueling a price rally of up to 400% within three days. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale Closing Soon: Last Chance Before The 400% Surge While Shiba Inu price continues to experience unpredictable price swings due to whale activity, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is proving to be a far more strategic investment. Its AI-powered wallet, low fees, and strong security features set it apart from traditional meme coins, making it a smart choice for investors seeking sustainable growth. With a presale selling out rapidly and a beta platform launch set to introduce groundbreaking crypto management tools, WLTQ is well-positioned for a significant 400% price explosion. By purchasing the WLTQ tokens at the current price of $0.0420 , those who get in now stand to gain the most.

In just 24 hours, an additional 400 investors joined the project, highlighting the strong demand for this emerging DeFi token. As the first presale phase nears its conclusion, investors are securing their tokens at $0.01, anticipating a 100% price increase in Phase Two. With its decentralized lending model, Mutuum Finance offers a unique opportunity for users to generate passive income while providing access to liquidity. The combination of strong market interest, structured tokenomics, and an upcoming platform launch has positioned MUTM as a high-potential investment in 2025. What Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance is a fully decentralized lending and borrowing protocol, designed to eliminate middlemen and put financial control back in the hands of users. Operating on smart contracts, the platform enables secure, automated lending and borrowing, allowing investors to maximize their crypto assets. The platform introduces two distinct lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Investors deposit assets into liquidity pools and receive mtTokens (such as mtETH or mtDAI), which accrue interest over time. This model ensures stable liquidity for borrowers while allowing lenders to earn passive income. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Users negotiate lending terms directly, unlocking borrowing options for tokens not supported in liquidity pools, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) or Pepe (PEPE) . This flexibility allows traders to access funds without selling their holdings. With a transparent and efficient approach, Mutuum Finance is addressing the growing demand for decentralized financial services. Why Investors Are Rushing to Mutuum Finance 1. Explosive Presale Growth Mutuum Finance has witnessed an exceptional presale performance, raising over $730,000 and attracting 400 new investors within 24 hours. With only a limited number of tokens available in Phase One, FOMO is growing as more investors rush to secure their position before the price moves up. 2. Passive Income with mtTokens Unlike speculative tokens, Mutuum Finance offers sustainable earning opportunities. By supplying assets to liquidity pools, investors receive mtTokens, which automatically accrue interest. For example, an investor who supplies $5,000 USDT at a 9% APY would earn an additional $450 in passive income over a year, without selling their initial investment. 3. Buy-and-Distribute Mechanism To create sustained demand, Mutuum Finance has implemented a buy-and-distribute mechanism. A share of the platform’s fees is allocated to buying back MUTM tokens, which are subsequently distributed to mtToken stakers. This process continuously drives demand, supporting price stability and benefiting long-term holders. Mutuum Finance is rapidly approaching its second presale phase, where the token price will increase from $0.01 to $0.015. Looking further ahead, by launch, MUTM is set to reach $0.06, representing a 600% surge. However, analysts suggest the price will go even higher, hitting $0.23 post-launch, marking a 2,300% increase. For instance, an investor purchasing 210,000 MUTM at $0.01 for $2,100 will see their holdings grow to $48,300 when the price reaches $0.23, showcasing the strong upside potential of early investment. With over 1,200 holders and $730K raised, Mutuum Finance is quickly proving to be one of the strongest DeFi contenders of 2025. Its decentralized lending platform, passive income opportunities, and innovative tokenomics have fueled growing investor interest. As Phase One nears completion, those looking to enter at the lowest possible price have limited time before the next price increase to $0.015.

40519444,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=699120,1739925027,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Bitcoin To $500,000: Standard Chartered Doubles Down On 2028 Target",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-500000-standard-chartered-2028-target/,"Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research, Geoffrey Kendrick, has reaffirmed his standout price forecast for Bitcoin. Kendrick, who envisions BTC hitting $500,000 by 2028, bases his conviction on evidence of increasing institutional involvement — specifically pointing to sovereign wealth funds, state pension funds, and other large-scale investors. Sovereign Wealth Funds Enter The Bitcoin Fray According to a new report from Standard Chartered cited by The Block, Kendrick sees growing signs that government-backed investment vehicles are ramping up their interest in Bitcoin. This view is reinforced by Abu Dhabi’s recent disclosure of a 4,700 BTC-equivalent position in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) via its sovereign wealth fund. Related Reading: Bitcoin Presents A ‘Generational Opportunity’ As Global Turmoil Intensifies, Says Bitwise Executive “While this is small for now, we would expect the size to increase over time and, indeed, for other sovereigns to also start buying,” Kendrick wrote in the Tuesday report. He explained that Abu Dhabi’s move marks a strategic shift and could presage broader participation from other wealth funds looking to diversify their portfolios with BTC. Kendrick’s confidence is partly rooted in Form 13F filings — quarterly reports that institutional managers overseeing at least $100 million in assets are required to file with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Reviewing data from the fourth quarter of 2024, Kendrick noted a compelling trend. “The 13F filings for Q4 show that process is underway…It is happening,” he said in an email to The Block. In Standard Chartered’s analysis, Q4 data revealed that while hedge funds maintained their lead in Bitcoin purchases, banks — which began buying in Q3 of last year — also ramped up their positions. Kendrick drew parallels between an earlier stage in Bitcoin’s market evolution, dominated by retail investors, and the more recent era, which saw hedge funds jump aboard through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Now, the spotlight appears to be broadening further to include state investment managers and central banks. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Big Breakout? Fed’s “Not QE, QE” Just Flipped The Switch “This gives us comfort to say that even if buying by Strategy… [formerly MicroStrategy] slows down dramatically (it has bought a staggering 227k BTC since the US election, more than 1% of the ever-to-exist supply), we think other buyers are waiting to step in,” Kendrick noted. The mention of MicroStrategy underscores just how significant one private company’s bitcoin holdings can be. Yet Standard Chartered’s analysis suggests that other large, patient pools of capital might absorb future supply, thus supporting higher prices over the long term. Among the institutions, Kendrick highlights the State of Wisconsin Investment Board and the State of Michigan Department of the Treasury. However, he also points to central banks as potential new participants. In the report, Kendrick references the Czech National Bank, which has considered allocating up to 5% of its €140 billion in reserves into bitcoin, and notes that the Swiss National Bank is in the early stages of contemplating a similar move. These developments could further bolster bitcoin’s legitimacy as a store of value on par with more traditional asset classes. “As institutional access to bitcoin improves and volatility declines, we expect more portfolios to migrate towards their optimal level from an underweight Bitcoin starting point,” Kendrick concluded. At press time, BTC traded at $95,581.
