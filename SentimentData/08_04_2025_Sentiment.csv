Why? Because global economic shifts and currency fluctuations can ripple through all asset classes, including digital currencies. Today, we’re diving into a significant Forex development: the British Pound (Sterling) has experienced a shocking slump against the Euro, reaching an eight-month low. This isn’t just another blip on the radar; it’s a consequence of escalating global trade tensions ignited by none other than former US President Donald Trump and his proposed reciprocal tariffs. Let’s break down what this means for the Forex market and the broader economic landscape. Understanding the Sterling Euro Exchange Rate Plunge The sterling euro exchange rate is a vital indicator of the relative economic health of the UK and the Eurozone. When you see headlines screaming about the Pound falling against the Euro, it signifies a weakening of the UK’s currency compared to the Euro. But what exactly triggered this recent downturn? The primary catalyst is the resurgence of trade war anxieties fueled by Donald Trump’s remarks about imposing reciprocal tariffs if re-elected. Trump’s Tariff Threats: The specter of increased tariffs, especially reciprocal ones, throws a wrench into global trade dynamics. Markets react swiftly to such pronouncements, anticipating potential disruptions to international commerce and economic stability. Market Uncertainty: Uncertainty is the enemy of stability in financial markets. Trump’s tariff rhetoric injects a significant dose of uncertainty into the forex market reaction , prompting investors to seek safer havens, often away from currencies perceived as being vulnerable to trade wars. Impact on GBP: The UK economy, already navigating Brexit-related complexities and inflationary pressures, is particularly sensitive to global trade headwinds. Trump’s tariff talk is seen as a negative factor for the UK’s economic outlook, leading to a sell-off in Sterling. To put it simply, the market is bracing for potential economic fallout, and the GBP EUR rate forecast is being revised downwards as a result. Decoding the Trump Tariffs Impact Why are Trump’s tariffs causing such a stir in the forex market reaction ? Let’s delve deeper into the mechanics of tariff impacts: Type of Tariff Mechanism Potential Impact on GBP/EUR Reciprocal Tariffs Tariffs imposed in response to tariffs imposed by another country. Creates a cycle of escalating trade barriers. Negative for GBP. Could lead to reduced UK exports to the US (if US tariffs are imposed on UK goods), weakening the UK economy and Sterling. Eurozone might be perceived as less directly impacted initially, strengthening EUR relative to GBP. General Import Tariffs Tariffs applied broadly to imports from many countries. Raises costs for businesses and consumers. Negative for GBP and potentially EUR, but impact could vary. If US tariffs are broad, global trade slows down, impacting all economies. However, relative impact on GBP could be greater if UK is more reliant on trade with tariff-affected regions. The fear is that reciprocal tariffs could trigger a trade war, leading to: Reduced Global Trade: Tariffs make imports more expensive, potentially reducing the volume of international trade. Slower Economic Growth: Trade wars can stifle economic growth by increasing costs for businesses, disrupting supply chains, and reducing consumer demand. Currency Volatility: Uncertainty surrounding trade policy leads to increased volatility in currency markets, making it harder for businesses to plan and invest. Navigating Global Trade Tensions: What Does This Mean for You? The current situation underscores the interconnectedness of the global trade tensions and financial markets. While you might be primarily focused on cryptocurrency, understanding these macroeconomic trends is vital. Here’s why: Risk Assessment: Forex market fluctuations are often leading indicators of broader economic sentiment. A weakening Sterling, driven by trade war fears, signals increased risk aversion in the market. This sentiment can spill over into other asset classes, including crypto. Portfolio Diversification: Understanding how traditional markets react to global events can inform your portfolio diversification strategies. If you see traditional assets becoming more volatile due to trade tensions, you might adjust your crypto holdings accordingly. Opportunity Spotting: Market volatility, while risky, can also present opportunities. Sharp currency movements can create trading opportunities in Forex and potentially impact crypto markets as well. Actionable Insights and the Path Ahead So, what should you do with this information? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on Forex news, especially developments related to trade policy and global trade tensions . Economic calendars and financial news outlets are your best friends. Monitor GBP/EUR: Track the sterling euro exchange rate closely. Significant movements can signal shifts in market sentiment and potential broader economic impacts. Consider Risk Management: In times of increased market uncertainty, prioritize risk management. This could involve adjusting your portfolio allocation, using stop-loss orders, or diversifying across different asset classes. Seek Expert Analysis: Don’t rely solely on headlines. Seek out expert analysis from reputable financial institutions and economists to get a deeper understanding of the situation and potential future scenarios for the GBP EUR rate forecast . Conclusion: Riding the Forex Waves The Sterling’s recent plunge against the Euro is a stark reminder of how global political and economic events can swiftly impact financial markets. Trump’s tariff threats have injected a fresh wave of uncertainty, highlighting the fragility of global trade and its influence on currency valuations. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, paying attention to these Forex market signals is not just about traditional finance; it’s about understanding the broader economic currents that can influence the entire financial ecosystem. By staying informed, analyzing market reactions, and adapting your strategies, you can navigate these turbulent times and potentially identify opportunities amidst the volatility. The Forex market, like the crypto market, is constantly in motion, and staying ahead of the curve is key to success.

The Stacks Foundation emphasizes the importance of attracting builders and developers to leverage the platform’s capabilities, aiming to transform Bitcoin into a globally accessible and decentralized financial system. These efforts underscore Stacks’ commitment to fostering growth and innovation within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin Cash Celebrates Halving Milestone and Sees Increased Adoption Bitcoin Cash (BCH) continues to experience significant developments within its ecosystem. The network recently celebrated a milestone with the successful halving event, reducing block rewards from 6.25 BCH to 3.125 BCH. This event has historically influenced the supply dynamics of BCH, attracting both miners and participants to adjust their strategies accordingly. The halving has also sparked discussions about its potential impact on Bitcoin’s upcoming halving, scheduled for April 20, 2025, prompting market participants to analyze and anticipate possible outcomes. ​ In the lead-up to the halving, BCH experienced a surge in adoption, with the number of funded wallets increasing from 25.88 million to 26.11 million within a ten-day span. This growth indicates a rising interest in the BCH network, as new users sought to capitalize on the perceived benefits of the halving event. However, post-halving, BCH’s price saw a correction, with a 15% decline observed shortly after the reward reduction. This fluctuation serves as a reminder of the market’s sensitivity to supply changes and the complexities involved in predicting price movements following such significant events.

Qubetics, in particular, has taken this concept to new heights by offering an easy-to-use platform that enables the tokenization of real-world assets like property, commodities, and intellectual property.

43052678,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147028,1744068038,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Groundbreaking Move: Nasdaq’s Janover Adopts Solana as Treasury Reserve, Rebrands to DeFi Powerhouse",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/janover-adopts-solana-defi-rebrand/,"In a truly revolutionary move that has sent ripples through both the traditional finance and cryptocurrency worlds, Nasdaq-listed Janover (JNVR) has announced its adoption of Solana (SOL) as its primary treasury reserve asset. This bold decision, reported by CNBC, signals a significant shift in corporate strategy and underscores the growing acceptance of digital assets by publicly traded companies. But what exactly does this mean, and why is it such a big deal for the future of finance and the crypto ecosystem? Why Solana as the Treasury Reserve Asset? The decision to anchor Janover’s treasury to Solana , a blockchain known for its speed and scalability, is far from arbitrary. It points towards a strategic alignment with the future of finance, which increasingly looks decentralized and crypto-centric. Let’s break down why Solana might be the perfect fit for this groundbreaking initiative: Speed and Scalability: Solana boasts incredibly fast transaction speeds and high throughput, making it ideal for handling the demands of a corporate treasury. Unlike older blockchains, Solana can process thousands of transactions per second, ensuring efficiency and agility. Low Transaction Costs: Another compelling advantage of Solana is its remarkably low transaction fees. This is crucial for a company managing its finances, as it minimizes overhead and maximizes the value of their holdings. Growing DeFi Ecosystem: Solana has a vibrant and rapidly expanding DeFi (Decentralized Finance) ecosystem. By holding Solana, Janover positions itself to potentially participate in and benefit from this burgeoning sector, opening doors to yield generation, staking, and other innovative financial instruments. Strong Community and Development: Solana benefits from a robust and active developer community. This continuous development and innovation ensure that the blockchain remains at the forefront of technological advancements, reducing the risk of obsolescence. Visionary Leadership: The takeover of Janover by crypto industry veterans, including former Kraken staff, suggests a deep understanding of the crypto landscape and a long-term vision for leveraging blockchain technology. Their expertise likely played a crucial role in selecting Solana. Rebranding to DeFi Development Corp: A Clear Signal of Intent? Janover’s planned rebranding to DeFi Development Corp is not just a cosmetic change; it’s a powerful declaration of their future direction. This name explicitly states their commitment to the world of Decentralized Finance. But what does this rebranding truly signify? Focus on DeFi: The new name leaves no doubt about the company’s primary focus. DeFi will be at the heart of their operations, suggesting they intend to build, invest in, or facilitate projects within this space. Attracting Crypto Talent and Investors: Rebranding as DeFi Development Corp is likely aimed at attracting talent and investors who are passionate about and knowledgeable in the crypto and DeFi sectors. It sends a clear message: “We are serious about DeFi.” Strategic Repositioning: For a Nasdaq-listed company to rebrand itself entirely around DeFi represents a dramatic strategic repositioning. It suggests a belief that DeFi is not just a niche market but the future of finance, and they want to be at the forefront. Potential Product and Service Development: The rebranding hints at the development of new products and services centered around DeFi. This could include building DeFi platforms, offering DeFi investment vehicles, or providing infrastructure for the DeFi ecosystem. Embracing Innovation: By adopting the DeFi moniker, Janover is signaling its embrace of innovation and its willingness to disrupt traditional financial models. This can be incredibly appealing to a market that is constantly seeking the next big thing. The Significance of a Crypto Treasury Reserve Strategy Adopting Treasury Reserve assets in cryptocurrency, especially Solana, is still a relatively novel concept for publicly traded companies. Traditionally, corporate treasuries are held in fiat currencies and low-risk assets. So, why would Janover choose to deviate from this norm and embrace a crypto treasury? Benefit Description Potential for Higher Returns Cryptocurrencies, while volatile, offer the potential for significantly higher returns compared to traditional treasury assets, especially in a low-interest rate environment. Diversification Holding Solana as a treasury asset diversifies Janover’s holdings beyond traditional markets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk in the long run. Inflation Hedge Some view cryptocurrencies as a hedge against inflation, as their supply is often limited or algorithmically controlled, unlike fiat currencies which can be subject to inflationary pressures. Alignment with Business Strategy For a company rebranding to DeFi Development Corp, holding crypto as a treasury reserve is a natural alignment with its core business and future direction. Brand Image and Innovation Being an early adopter of crypto as a treasury reserve can enhance Janover’s brand image as innovative and forward-thinking, attracting attention from investors and customers alike. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges associated with a crypto treasury reserve: Challenge Description Volatility Cryptocurrencies are known for their price volatility. Holding Solana as a treasury asset exposes Janover to potential significant fluctuations in asset value. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving and varies across jurisdictions. This uncertainty can pose risks and compliance challenges. Security Risks Storing and managing cryptocurrency holdings securely requires robust security measures to protect against theft and hacking. Accounting and Tax Complexity Accounting for and taxing cryptocurrency holdings can be complex and requires specialized expertise. Market Perception While innovative, the move to a crypto treasury might be viewed with skepticism by some traditional investors who are unfamiliar with or wary of cryptocurrencies. Crypto Rebranding: More Than Just a Name Change? The concept of Crypto Rebranding is becoming increasingly common as companies in the traditional space seek to align themselves with the burgeoning digital asset market. But is it merely a marketing gimmick, or does it represent a deeper strategic shift? In Janover’s case, it appears to be the latter. Signaling a Strategic Pivot: Rebranding to DeFi Development Corp is a clear signal that Janover is not just dabbling in crypto; it’s making a fundamental strategic pivot towards becoming a core player in the DeFi space. Attracting a New Audience: The rebranding is designed to resonate with a new audience – the crypto community, DeFi enthusiasts, and investors who are looking for exposure to digital assets through publicly traded companies. Creating a Cohesive Brand Identity: The new brand identity is designed to be cohesive with the company’s new focus on DeFi. It’s about creating a brand that is synonymous with innovation, decentralization, and the future of finance. Investor Confidence (Potentially): For some investors, a dedicated focus on DeFi and crypto might increase confidence in the company’s future prospects, especially if they believe in the long-term potential of digital assets. Cultural Shift Within the Company: A rebrand often accompanies a cultural shift within the company. It can be a catalyst for adopting new values, embracing innovation, and fostering a crypto-native mindset. A Nasdaq Listed Company Embracing Crypto: Is This the Start of a Trend? Janover, a Nasdaq Listed Company , taking such a decisive step into the crypto world is a landmark moment. It begs the question: is this an isolated incident, or are we witnessing the beginning of a broader trend where mainstream, publicly traded companies begin to integrate cryptocurrencies into their operations and balance sheets? Validation of Crypto as an Asset Class: When a Nasdaq-listed company adopts crypto as a treasury reserve, it lends further legitimacy and validation to cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class. Setting a Precedent: Janover’s move could set a precedent for other publicly traded companies to explore similar strategies, particularly those looking to innovate and tap into new growth markets. Increased Institutional Adoption: This could be a significant step towards increased institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. As more companies see the potential benefits, we might see a snowball effect. Bridging Traditional and Crypto Finance: This move helps bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world. It demonstrates that these two worlds are not mutually exclusive but can be integrated and mutually beneficial. Catalyst for Regulatory Clarity: As more publicly traded companies engage with crypto, it might also accelerate the push for clearer and more consistent regulatory frameworks for digital assets, which is crucial for wider adoption. Conclusion: A Bold Leap into the Future Janover’s adoption of Solana as its treasury reserve asset and its rebranding to DeFi Development Corp is a bold and potentially transformative move. It signifies a profound belief in the future of decentralized finance and the role of cryptocurrencies in the global economy. While challenges and uncertainties remain, this pioneering step by a Nasdaq-listed company could well be a watershed moment, paving the way for wider corporate adoption of crypto and accelerating the convergence of traditional and decentralized finance. Keep a close watch on JNVR – they might just be writing the next chapter in financial history.

He hinges his belief on several initiatives by the PCT while urging investors not to sell their Pi Coins in the face of extended bearish sentiments. Lang Says Pi Network Is Building Behind The Scenes After enduring a torrid week that saw Pi Network price tumble to $0.58, John Lang is kindling bullish sentiments for Pi Coin holders. According to a post on X , the Pi Network node runner revealed that the price correction is only a small blip in the grand scheme of things for Pi. His optimism stems from a series of behind-the-scenes activities by the PiCoreTeam which he says will usher a range of positives for the network. Per Lang, Pi community members should be patient with the PCT in view of the mountain of work before the development team. “Guys, be patient with the PiCoreTeam. They keep working, building meticulously behind the scenes,” said Lang. “Their task is not easy and there are so much things to do.” His comments come on the heels of scathing criticism against the PCT revolving around delays for KYB approvals for community projects. Things reached a head after PiDaoSwap launched NFTs on BSC as a temporary fix to the lengthy delays by the PCT. Furthermore, Lang wants investors not to capitulate despite the pervading bearish conditions. Pi price has slipped 13% and is in free fall toward $0.3 with all eyes on the PCT for a short-term fix. “Just trust the process and whatever the market condition is, never sell your Pi cheap,” said Lang. PiCoreTeam Releases Technical Conditions For Ecosystem Developers In a recent update, the PCT has released technical conditions for developers keen on building applications on the Pi Network. The conditions focus on a mobile-first strategy spelling out development language and framework while rolling out a software development kit. Per the announcement, developers must pass KYC certification, and apps on the network must indicate a way of value exchange. The PCT’s pragmatic suggestions include apps for virtual goods, service decentralized applications (DApps), and mini-game platforms. The PCT has released an update on Pi domain auctions , noting that bids have surpassed the 200,000 mark confirming rising on-chain metrics. Despite the rising PCT activity, market analyst Dr Altcoin has urged the PCT to burn billions of Pi Coins in its foundation wallets. The pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto has urged community members to help stabilize the Pi price via a decentralized strategy. Nakamoto proposes a community-driven liquidity pool (CDLP) powered by investors committing to purchase a fixed amount of Pi each month.

Imagine buying your favorite cryptocurrencies with the same ease and convenience you use for everyday online shopping. That future is rapidly becoming reality as Binance, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, joins forces with Worldpay, a giant in payment processing. This powerful partnership is set to revolutionize how users buy crypto, making it more accessible than ever before. Let’s dive into how this collaboration is streamlining crypto purchases for millions worldwide. What’s the Buzz About Binance and Worldpay’s Partnership? The headline says it all: Binance has teamed up with Worldpay to enable crypto purchases directly through Apple Pay and Google Pay. This isn’t just a minor update; it’s a significant leap forward in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. Here’s the core of what’s happening: Simplified Fiat-to-Crypto Gateway: By integrating Apple Pay and Google Pay, Binance is drastically simplifying the process of converting fiat currency (like USD, EUR, etc.) into cryptocurrencies.

43052963,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147030,1744068634,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Insights: CryptoQuant CEO Reveals On-Chain Data’s Secret to Mastering the Bitcoin Market,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crucial-insights-bitcoin-market-data/,"Ever wondered what truly drives the Bitcoin market? In a world buzzing with ‘paper Bitcoin’ narratives, are we missing the real story unfolding beneath the surface? CryptoQuant CEO, Ki Young Ju, recently dropped a truth bomb on X, highlighting the crucial role of on-chain data in understanding the Bitcoin market. Let’s dive deep into why ignoring it might be a costly mistake for any crypto enthusiast or investor. Why On-Chain Data is Your Secret Weapon in the Bitcoin Market Ki Young Ju argues that the real action, especially when it comes to big players, happens on the blockchain. He emphasized that institutional activities – think brokerage flows, OTC (over-the-counter) deals, custodial wallets, massive MicroStrategy transactions, and even those much-talked-about spot ETFs – are predominantly settled on-chain. Why? Because on-chain transactions provide an immutable, transparent record, essential for maintaining client trust and operational integrity in high-stakes finance. Consider this: Transparency and Trust: For institutions handling billions, on-chain data offers verifiable proof of transactions, fostering trust with clients and regulators alike. Comprehensive Market View: Unlike traditional market data, on-chain metrics provide insights into actual fund movements, not just price speculations on exchanges. Supply and Demand Dynamics: By tracking on-chain flows, we gain a clearer picture of the real supply and demand forces at play in the Bitcoin market. Ignoring on-chain data , according to Ki Young Ju, is akin to navigating the ocean without a compass, simply because you prefer paper maps. In the fast-paced, often volatile world of crypto, this could leave you directionless and vulnerable. Decoding Institutional Activity: What On-Chain Data Tells Us Institutional investors are no longer on the sidelines; they are increasingly shaping the Bitcoin market . Understanding their movements is key to anticipating market trends. On-chain data provides a window into their behavior, revealing patterns that are invisible through traditional market analysis alone. What kind of institutional activity can we track on-chain? Spot ETF Flows: While ETF trading volumes are reported, on-chain data confirms the actual Bitcoin movements into and out of ETF custodial wallets, validating the real impact of these investment vehicles. Custodial Wallet Balances: Significant changes in custodial wallet balances can signal accumulation or distribution phases by large institutions. OTC Desk Activity: Large OTC deals, often favored by institutions for their size and discretion, leave on-chain footprints that can be analyzed to gauge institutional buying or selling pressure. Brokerage Flows: Tracking flows to and from brokerage platforms can indicate shifts in institutional sentiment and positioning. The Power of Market Analysis with On-Chain Metrics Traditional market analysis often relies on price charts, trading volumes, and derivatives data. While these are valuable, they paint an incomplete picture. On-chain analysis adds a layer of depth and granularity, offering a more holistic view of the Bitcoin market . Here’s how on-chain data enhances market analysis : Identifying Whale Accumulation and Distribution: Large transactions and wallet movements can reveal the actions of whales, often early indicators of market shifts. Assessing Miner Activity: Miner flows and reserves provide insights into selling pressure from miners, a crucial aspect of Bitcoin’s supply dynamics. Analyzing Exchange Flows: Net exchange flows (inflows vs. outflows) can signal changes in investor sentiment – are people moving Bitcoin to exchanges to sell, or withdrawing to hold? Long-Term Holder Behavior: Metrics like HODL waves and coin dormancy can indicate the conviction and behavior of long-term Bitcoin holders, offering clues about market resilience. CryptoQuant CEO’s Perspective: A Data-Driven Approach CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju isn’t just another voice in the crypto space; he leads a company dedicated to providing on-chain data and analytics. His emphasis on the importance of this data stems from a deep understanding of market dynamics and a commitment to data-driven decision-making. His recent statement serves as a reminder to the crypto community to look beyond the surface noise and delve into the verifiable, transparent world of blockchain data. In a market often swayed by hype and speculation, CryptoQuant CEO advocates for a grounded, data-backed approach. Benefits of embracing on-chain data for market analysis: Enhanced Market Understanding: Gain a deeper, more nuanced understanding of market forces beyond price action. Improved Decision Making: Make more informed investment decisions based on verifiable data rather than speculation. Early Trend Detection: Identify emerging market trends and shifts in institutional behavior ahead of the curve. Risk Management: Better assess market risks and potential volatility by understanding underlying on-chain dynamics. Challenges and Considerations in On-Chain Data Analysis While incredibly powerful, on-chain data analysis isn’t without its challenges. It requires a certain level of technical understanding and the right tools to interpret the vast amounts of data effectively. Some key considerations include: Data Overload: The sheer volume of on-chain data can be overwhelming. Knowing which metrics to focus on and how to interpret them is crucial. Complexity of Interpretation: Interpreting on-chain data requires context and understanding of market mechanics. Raw data alone isn’t enough; it needs expert analysis. Tooling and Resources: Access to reliable on-chain data platforms and analytical tools is necessary. Potential for Misinterpretation: Like any data, on-chain metrics can be misinterpreted if not analyzed correctly or without considering other market factors. Actionable Insights: How to Start Leveraging On-Chain Data Ready to harness the power of on-chain data ? Here are some actionable steps to get started: Explore On-Chain Data Platforms: Familiarize yourself with platforms like CryptoQuant, Glassnode, Nansen, and Santiment. These platforms offer user-friendly interfaces and a wealth of on-chain metrics. Start with Key Metrics: Begin by tracking a few essential metrics like exchange flows, miner reserves, and whale transactions. Educate Yourself: Read articles, watch tutorials, and follow analysts who specialize in on-chain data interpretation. Combine with Traditional Analysis: Use on-chain insights to complement your existing technical and fundamental analysis for a more comprehensive market view. Practice and Observe: Regularly monitor on-chain data, observe market reactions, and refine your understanding over time. Conclusion: Unlocking Bitcoin’s Future with On-Chain Intelligence In conclusion, the message from CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju is clear: on-chain data is not just an optional extra; it’s a crucial component for truly understanding the Bitcoin market , especially the significant influence of institutional activity . By embracing on-chain analysis, we move beyond surface-level observations and gain access to the underlying dynamics that drive this revolutionary asset. In a market as dynamic and transformative as cryptocurrency, leveraging every available tool for insight is not just smart – it’s essential for navigating the path ahead.

Early reports confirm that 200,000,000 XRP, worth approximately $355.6 million, was transferred from an unknown wallet to Binance. This movement has triggered concerns about possible price volatility in the near term. The XRP price as a result of the Ripple whale dropped to around $1.61, sparking fears of a further dip. Ripple Whale Major Transaction Sparks Worry According to Whale Alert, a Ripple whale has moved 200 million XRP to Binance. The total value of this transfer stands at $355,576,574 based on the current XRP price. Such large movements often signal upcoming trading activity that could affect price behavior. Moreover, some optimism is building up brought by the NYSE Arca approval of listing and registration of Teucrium’s 2X Long Daily XRP ETF. Post the Ripple whale action, analysts on social media have shared differing views on this development. Dark Defender commented, “There is no change in our XRP Monthly Frame. $1.8815 is holding firm.” While the origin of the Ripple whale remains unknown, historical data shows that similar movements have preceded corrections or temporary price drops. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ali Charts has predicted that XRP price is breaking out of a head-and-shoulders pattern, setting the stage for a potential move to $1.30 . This interpretation adds a short-term XRP bearish perspective if the pattern confirms lower levels before a potential rebound. Will XRP Price Rally To $8 in April? Concurrent with the Ripple whale, Casi Trades, reported that the $1.90 support level has broken down, turning it into a resistance point for XRP price. “This low made new extremes on the RSI,” they stated, referring to the market-wide price dip that took XRP to $1.61. Casi also noted the next support at $1.55 , which aligns with the .618 Fibonacci retracement level. This is a crucial area where many traders are setting alerts. According to the trader, “If we do bottom near $1.55, it actually strengthens the bullish case for those big April targets—$8 to $13 still stands.” CredibleCrypto echoed similar thoughts, noting that XRP finally moved below a range low that had held for over a month. They pointed to a key demand zone between $1.61 and $1.79, suggesting it offers a possible setup for a rebound. However, they also noted that “Ideally we bracket/range here for a bit to form a base before a full-on reversal.” As of now, despite the Ripple whale move the XRP price is consolidating just above this zone. Analyst Outlines Key Resistance To Breach To Resume Bull Rally Technical analysts have continued to monitor the Elliott Wave structure, suggesting that XRP price may be completing Wave 2 of a larger trend. This theory proposes that a strong Wave 3 could begin soon, which typically represents a strong upward movement. The local resistance levels to watch include $1.97 and $2.17. A breakout above these points could lead to a move toward higher targets like $2.72 and possibly the previous all-time high of $3.70. However, a failure to hold above $1.61 could shift the focus to a deeper correction. According to Egrag, a potential double-bottom or inverse head-and-shoulders pattern forming, which could support a bullish reversal if confirmed. This pattern is forming within the demand zone, which is being viewed by some traders as an ideal long setup for XRP price. Historical Market Cycles and Long-Term View Egrag Crypto s hared a long-term view , drawing from past market cycles. They compared the current XRP price movement with patterns from 2017 and 2021. According to Egrag, during both cycles, XRP price touched or dropped below the 200 MA (moving average) before making large gains. “In 2017, XRP dropped 73% then pumped 2700%. In 2021, it dropped 78% then pumped 1000%,” Egrag stated. He emphasized that as long as the 50 MA hasn’t crossed below the 200 MA, the bullish trend remains valid. Egrag pointed out that short-term price declines are part of larger patterns. “You buy the blood, even if it’s your own,” he wrote, referring to buying during market fear.

The decision reflects a broader pullback from speculative digital asset ventures. Users are advised to relocate their assets to alternative storage options. VK, one of Russia’s largest social media platforms, announced that it would shut down its NFT marketplace, VK NFT Hub, on April 15, due to mounting financial losses. The move follows VK’s 2024 net loss of 94.9 billion rubles (around $1.1 billion), nearly triple its 2023 losses of 34.3 billion rubles. VK Financial Struggles and the Collapse of Its NFT Marketplace To reduce its debt load, VK plans to issue $1.36 billion in new shares, a decision made amid deepening financial setbacks. The company has urged users to move their NFTs to external wallets before April 15 to avoid losing access to their assets. After that date, the platform will remove the neon diamond icons on user avatars that once indicated NFT ownership. Users who bought NFTs mainly for avatar integration will lose their visual indicators on VK. While the VK NFT community page will remain accessible, the company has not confirmed whether it plans to return to the NFT or digital asset space in the future. VK’s exit comes during a downturn in the NFT sector, reflecting broader trends across the industry. 1/ After an incredible 3-year journey, I have some important news to share: X2Y2 will be sunsetting as an NFT marketplace on April 30, 2025. The contracts will remain live, but the platform itself will shut down. — TP | X2Y2 (@tp_x2y2) March 31, 2025 Recently, NFT marketplace X2Y2 and crypto exchange Bybit also announced closures of their respective NFT platforms. X2Y2, formerly the fourth-largest NFT platform by trading volume, will cease operations on April 30. Bybit closed its NFT marketplace earlier this month, on April 8. NFT Market Decline Mirrors Dot-Com Crash Signs NFT activity peaked in 2021, driven by celebrity endorsements and speculative investments. According to industry data , NFT trading volumes have dropped more than 90% since their all-time highs. NFT monthly trading volume(Jan 2023- Feb 2025)/ Source: Dune Analytics X2Y2, for example, recorded just $53.5 million in trading volume over the past year—down from a peak of $5.6 billion. High-profile sales, such as Beeple’s $69 million NFT at Christie’s, drew global attention to the space. I’ve seen a lot of people posting this. This is an example of demand > supply In 2021-2022 there were a lot of people trading digital assets. Market cap for NFTs hit $1.8 Billion. Right now it’s $3.9 million. You see I see opportunity NFTs have evolved in the last 3 years pic.twitter.com/drkGyROJVK — AspenShredder.eth (@aspenshredder) April 2, 2025 This momentum led brands, artists, musicians, and sports organizations to create their own digital assets and collectibles. Yet, much like the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s, the NFT market proved unsustainable in the long run, fueled more by speculation than lasting value. 96% of highly-ranked NFTs in 2022 are worthless today/ Source: NFTEvening Collections like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) saw record prices during the boom. However, many of these assets have since collapsed in value . For instance, Justin Bieber bought Bored Ape #3001 in January 2022 for 500 ETH (around $1.3 million at the time). It is now worth only 13.89 ETH —roughly $24,679 with ETH trading at $1,561 . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What lessons can be learned from the NFT marketplace shutdown? The shutdown shows digital asset platforms must build sustainable operations and ensure clear asset protection. It firmly warns that relying solely on market hype leaves platforms vulnerable to abrupt exits. How might this decision influence future market models for digital content? The closure could prompt a redesign of market models that focus on secure, transparent digital commerce. Stakeholders may adopt new criteria to evaluate underlying asset value rather than transient market trends. What role do emerging technical standards play in light of such platform exits? New tech standards can boost security and compatibility. As providers reevaluate operations, updated protocols may offer clearer benchmarks for verifying digital assets and managing custody efficiently.

Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the former CEO of Binance, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, has officially joined the Pakistan Crypto Council as a strategic advisor. This news, first reported by TechJuice, has ignited discussions and hopes for accelerated Web3 adoption and blockchain development within the nation. Backed by key government figures, this move signals Pakistan’s serious intent to position itself as a prominent player in the burgeoning digital economy. But what exactly does this mean for Pakistan, and how will CZ’s expertise shape its crypto future? Why is Changpeng Zhao’s Appointment a Big Deal for Pakistan? Changpeng Zhao, or CZ as he’s widely known, is a titan in the cryptocurrency industry. As the founder and former CEO of Binance, he steered the exchange to become a global powerhouse, handling billions in daily trading volume. His journey from a developer to a crypto billionaire is an inspiring story in itself. Now, his decision to become a strategic advisor to the Pakistan Crypto Council is being viewed as a major endorsement of Pakistan’s potential in the digital asset space. Here’s why this partnership is generating so much excitement: Global Expertise: CZ brings unparalleled global experience in building and scaling a massive cryptocurrency exchange. His insights into regulatory frameworks, technological infrastructure, and market dynamics are invaluable. Credibility and Influence: CZ’s involvement lends instant credibility to Pakistan’s crypto ambitions on the international stage. His reputation can attract investment and talent to the country’s nascent Web3 ecosystem. Strategic Guidance: As a strategic advisor, CZ will be directly involved in shaping Pakistan’s crypto policies, infrastructure development, and Web3 adoption strategies. This hands-on guidance can help Pakistan avoid common pitfalls and accelerate its growth trajectory. Focus on Web3 Adoption and Blockchain Development The core objective of this collaboration is to propel Pakistan into the forefront of the Web3 revolution. Web3, the decentralized internet of the future, powered by blockchain development , promises to transform various sectors, from finance to supply chain management and beyond. CZ’s advisory role is specifically geared towards: Developing Robust Regulatory Frameworks: One of the biggest hurdles for crypto adoption globally is regulatory uncertainty. CZ’s experience navigating complex regulatory landscapes worldwide will be crucial in helping Pakistan establish clear, effective, and investor-friendly crypto regulations. This includes frameworks for crypto exchanges, digital assets, and decentralized applications (dApps). Building World-Class Infrastructure: For widespread Web3 adoption , Pakistan needs robust technological infrastructure. This encompasses everything from high-speed internet access and secure digital payment systems to blockchain development platforms and educational resources. CZ’s advice can guide investments in the right infrastructure areas. Promoting Crypto Literacy and Adoption: Beyond infrastructure and regulation, fostering public awareness and understanding of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is paramount. CZ can help devise strategies to educate the Pakistani population about the benefits of Web3 and encourage responsible blockchain development and crypto usage. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Pakistan’s Crypto Ambitions? While CZ’s appointment is undoubtedly a positive step, Pakistan’s journey to becoming a regional digital finance hub will not be without its challenges. Here are some key hurdles to consider: Challenge Description Regulatory Hurdles: Crafting regulations that are both innovation-friendly and protect consumers is a delicate balancing act. Pakistan needs to avoid overly restrictive regulations that stifle growth while ensuring investor safety and preventing illicit activities. Infrastructure Gaps: While urban centers in Pakistan have decent internet connectivity, rural areas may lag behind. Bridging this digital divide is crucial for inclusive Web3 adoption . Talent Pool Development: The blockchain and Web3 space requires specialized skills. Pakistan needs to invest in education and training programs to build a strong domestic talent pool in areas like blockchain development , cryptography, and cybersecurity. Public Perception and Trust: Cryptocurrencies still face skepticism in some quarters. Building public trust through education and demonstrating the tangible benefits of blockchain technology is essential for widespread acceptance. Examples of Successful Crypto Hubs and Lessons for Pakistan Pakistan can draw inspiration from countries that have successfully positioned themselves as crypto hubs. Let’s look at a couple of examples: Singapore: Singapore has become a leading crypto hub by adopting a progressive regulatory approach, fostering innovation, and attracting global crypto businesses. Its clear regulatory framework and supportive government policies have been key to its success. Switzerland: Switzerland’s “Crypto Valley” in Zug has thrived due to its business-friendly environment, clear legal guidelines, and strong focus on data privacy. It has attracted a large number of blockchain startups and established companies. Dubai, UAE: Dubai is rapidly emerging as a crypto hub, driven by its forward-thinking government, favorable regulations, and investments in blockchain infrastructure. Its commitment to becoming a digital economy leader is attracting significant crypto activity. These examples highlight the importance of a proactive government, clear regulations, infrastructure investment, and talent development. Pakistan can learn from these models as it charts its own course in the crypto space. Actionable Insights: What Should Pakistan Focus On? To maximize the benefits of CZ’s advisory role and achieve its digital finance hub ambitions, Pakistan should focus on the following actionable steps: Prioritize Regulatory Clarity: Develop and implement clear, comprehensive, and innovation-friendly crypto regulations in consultation with industry experts and international best practices. Invest in Digital Infrastructure: Improve internet access, particularly in underserved areas, and build robust digital payment systems to support Web3 adoption . Promote Blockchain Education: Launch national-level blockchain education and training programs to build a skilled workforce and foster crypto literacy among the general public. Foster Public-Private Partnerships: Encourage collaboration between government, private sector companies, and academia to drive innovation and blockchain development . Engage with the Global Crypto Community: Actively participate in international crypto forums and engage with global industry leaders to stay abreast of the latest trends and best practices. Conclusion: A Transformative Opportunity for Pakistan The appointment of former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao as a strategic advisor to the Pakistan Crypto Council represents a transformative opportunity for the nation. It’s a bold move that signals Pakistan’s ambition to embrace the digital revolution and become a significant player in the global Web3 landscape. While challenges remain, CZ’s expertise, combined with proactive government policies and strategic investments, can pave the way for Pakistan to unlock the immense potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain development . The world will be watching as Pakistan embarks on this exciting journey to shape its digital future.

As of April 7, 2025, XRP is trading at $1.7917 , down over 13% in 24 hours . It’s clear: the days of turning $500 into $50K with XRP may be over. Meanwhile, one new crypto is proving immune to the chaos: MAGACOIN FINANCE . The emerging presale project has now raised $5.5 million dollars , with Phase 6 more than 90% sold out , positioning itself as the standout opportunity in a shaken market. XRP Dives Below $1.80 Amid Tariff Shock The broader crypto market has been rocked by news of new international tariffs, sparking panic selling across altcoins and majors alike. XRP is leading the drop among major alts: Current Price: $1.7917 Intraday High: $1.9542 Intraday Low: $1.6134 Volume: 504.84M 24H Change: -6.77% (Binance) Market Sentiment: Dropping fast Despite recent regulatory clarity after settling with the SEC, XRP hasn’t been able to maintain upward momentum. Even with forecasts placing XRP somewhere between $5 and $7 by late 2025, current price action is painting a different picture—and investors are starting to look elsewhere for growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Raised $5.5M and Climbing Fast While XRP struggles under macroeconomic pressure, MAGACOIN FINANCE is surging in presale demand. The project has officially raised over $5,500,000 . Why are investors flocking to this new token? Fixed supply with scarcity-driven price structure Massive 50% bonus still live with code MAGA50X Cultural and political momentum backing the brand Analysts predict up to 25x returns , with a $1 target by mid-2025 Even in today’s red market, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains in the green when it comes to investor demand. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Still Hit $1 by 2025 Its early fundraising success, combined with smart tokenomics and growing community support, has analysts calling it one of the few tokens positioned for exponential growth in 2025. In contrast to XRP’s mature price action, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still early —and early-stage is where fortunes are made. XRP vs. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Sentiment Shift Is Real LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH CODE MAGA50X With the entire market bleeding, the coins that can still grow during downturns are standing out. XRP’s sharp decline has reaffirmed fears that large-cap alts may be tapped out in terms of ROI. MAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, is benefiting from fresh investor inflow, not legacy speculation. This presale shows no signs of slowing down—and those entering before now are in prime position for upside. With Phase7 nearing full capacity, this is your last chance to grab MAGACOIN FINANCE at the current price. The next phase will push the price higher, just as the project nears critical mass and major exchange attention. Don’t wait for XRP to recover— MAGACOIN FINANCE might already be the smarter play for 2025 .

Ethereum is facing significant downside pressure, with analysts bracing for a potential correction to $1,400. XRP, meanwhile, is perched above crucial support at $2.00, inching toward a possible breakout at $2.94—but momentum is fading. Then there’s BlockDAG, moving in a different lane altogether. While others react to market cycles, BlockDAG is actively building its future. With $212 million already raised in its presale and a live Beta Testnet processing over 1.2 million transactions, it’s proving that traction and delivery still win. Tools, adoption, and usability—not just price charts—are what matter most, and BlockDAG is checking every box. As attention shifts from speculative trading to practical utility, long-term participants are starting to see where the real opportunity lies—and that spotlight is now firmly on BDAG. Will Ethereum Sink to $1,400? Technical Signals Point to More Pain Ethereum’s recent market activity is flashing caution signals as bearish momentum gains strength. Analyst Klejdi suggests ETH could fall toward the $1,400 level if current conditions hold, citing bearish MACD movement, weakening RSI, and key failed support levels. Ethereum’s price remains capped under crucial resistance zones, and without positive catalysts, downside risk grows. Wider economic concerns also weigh on sentiment. Macroeconomic pressures, uncertainty around U.S. policy, and slowing institutional demand have left Ethereum vulnerable. A breakdown toward $1,400 could ripple across decentralized finance (DeFi) and the NFT space, shaking investor confidence. Still, not all is gloom. Some long-term holders view this decline as a possible entry point—especially with Ethereum upgrades on the horizon. But near-term, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve’s decisions, which could either stabilize or further destabilize crypto’s second-largest asset. XRP Nears Make-or-Break Zone as $2.94 Target Comes Into Focus XRP is sitting on a knife’s edge as it consolidates between $2.00 and $2.20, with traders closely watching whether bulls can reclaim momentum. A breakout above $2.20 could open the door to higher targets at $2.50 and $2.94, while failure to hold above $2.00 may lead to declines toward $1.80 or even $1.50. Chart watchers have noted a developing head-and-shoulders formation, traditionally a bearish signal. Technical indicators such as RSI and MACD suggest fading strength, although a confirmed move past $2.20 could flip the outlook quickly. For traders seeking short-term opportunities, the $2.00 zone offers a potential entry point—with stops near $1.90 and targets aimed at the upper resistance band. The window for XRP to regain bullish footing is narrowing, making this a crucial stretch. BlockDAG Keunote Redefines Execution: Testnet Launch, $212M Raised, and $1 Price Potential BlockDAG’s latest keynote was more than a development update—it was a strategic milestone that signaled readiness for scale. The platform’s Beta Testnet V1 is now fully live, supporting more than 1.2 million transactions and over 100 operational community nodes. This rollout includes a functional block explorer, tools for building tokens and NFTs, and early decentralized apps already running. In just 48 hours after Keynote 3, BlockDAG raised an additional $5 million, pushing its presale to over $212 million. With 19.1 billion BDAG coins sold and 16,600 ASIC mining rigs shipped, adoption isn’t just growing—it’s accelerating. But what sets BlockDAG apart is its full-stack approach. The roadmap includes support for more than 1,000 decentralized applications by 2026, DeFi features like staking, swaps, and lending, and a dual EVM + WASM architecture. This makes it ideal for developers, creators, and institutions alike. Now in Batch 27 at $0.0248, BDAG offers an early-stage entry into a network that’s not only building the future—it’s already live. The projected $1 price target could mean a 40x return for those entering today. With a presale this active and infrastructure already delivering, BlockDAG isn’t just a promising idea—it’s a project in full motion. Final Look: Which Project Is Poised to Lead? Ethereum may still face a drop before stabilizing, with $1,400 now in sight if bearish conditions continue. XRP could break above $2.94, but that move hinges on reclaiming and holding key resistance levels. Both projects offer short-term trade potential, but neither is currently delivering new infrastructure at scale. BlockDAG stands in sharp contrast. With a live Testnet already processing over 1.2 million transactions, over $212 million raised, and tools for token creation, dApps, and staking in place before mainnet launch, it’s moving beyond promises and into production. Its roadmap, backed by confirmed DeFi features and dual compatibility with EVM and WASM, points to a project built for longevity. As Ethereum and XRP navigate technical barriers, BlockDAG’s consistent execution is gaining real-world traction. If it achieves even a portion of its $1 projection from its current $0.0248 presale price, the upside potential could far outpace what traditional players can offer in this cycle.

The study, which compares listings on BitMEX, Binance, Bybit, and OKX from the beginning of 2025 to March 2025, highlights significant exchange-specific variations in price performance. Key findings from the the study include: BitMEX Outperformance: BitMEX emerged as a standout exchange with the highest number of perpetual swap listings, with an average gain of 62.55% among listings that appreciated after the first day. Notably, 58.33% of its listings continued to appreciate post-listing day. Exchange Variability: The data shows that only 41.67% of BitMEX listings reached their all-time high (ATH) on the first day, contrasting with 70.83% on OKX and 50% on Binance. This indicates that the ""first day peak"" theory is not universally applicable across exchanges. Price Peak Timing: Most tokens that appreciate post-listing reach their maximum price within the first week, with BitMEX listings taking a median of six days to peak. ""Our analysis highlights BitMEX's unique ability to identify and support promising token projects, offering traders a platform where they can capitalise on sustained price appreciation. This is a testament to our rigorous listing process and market structure, which we believe provides a competitive edge for both traders and listed assets,"" said Stephan Lutz, CEO of BitMEX. The study underscores the importance of exchange-specific dynamics in helping traders profit from trading perpetual swap listings. By leveraging these insights, traders can develop more effective strategies for navigating the evolving landscape of new perpetual swap listings. With its superior listing performance and sustained price appreciation, BitMEX remains a preferred platform for both traders and projects seeking to maximise their potential in the cryptocurrency derivatives market.

In a new interview on Crypto Banter, Hayes, the founder of crypto investment firm Maelstrom, says that he’s expecting Bitcoin to continue dominating the crypto market for some time. However, Hayes says once BTC soars well above the $100,000 level again, riskier crypto assets will most likely start to shine. “We accelerated a bit after the recent Fed press conference where Powell announced the reduction of QT (quantitative tightening) and sort of teased QE (quantitative easing). We accelerated a bit, and if the market continues to collapse a bit, we’ll probably accelerate even more in terms of deploying capital. Most of what we’re buying is Bitcoin, I think Bitcoin dominance – that is the percentage of Bitcoin in the whole cryptocurrency market – continues to rise, and then at some point, let’s say Bitcion’s at $110,000 or $120,000 or some level, then altcoins will start to get to fire, and we’ll rotate out of that and into some things that we really like.” In the altcoin space, Hayes says he’s looking for Ethereum ( ETH ) to outperform Solana ( SOL ). “I hold a lot of Ethereum, I think at some point, the Ethereum hate is going to change. Usually, the most hated asset is the best-performing asset in the next cycle and the most loved is the worst-performing. It’s just mean reversion; it doesn’t necessarily mean that one is better than the other. But if I had to deploy a fresh dollar of capital today, I’d buy ETH rather than Solana just because ETH is more hated than Solana. And I think the memecoin fad is going to be done for a while, not to say it’s going away, I think memecoins are going to be here to stay for a very long time, but a lot of retail people lost a lot of money, and they’re not going to be slinging stuff on Pump.fun and creating transaction fees for Solana as much as they used to. So I think that narrative about Solana being the memecoin L1, that’s going to hurt its ability to really outpace other L1s in the cycle.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The Bitcoin rollercoaster might be gearing up for another thrilling ride. While Bitcoin has shown impressive resilience lately, outperforming traditional equities, a new report from Bitfinex Alpha suggests that Bitcoin volatility could be just around the corner. What’s fueling this potential turbulence? Let’s dive into the factors at play, from economic headwinds to the exciting fusion of crypto and traditional finance. Is Bitcoin Volatility Really Looming? Decoding the Signals Bitfinex Alpha’s weekly analysis points to a few key indicators suggesting increased Bitcoin volatility . Despite the positive price action, short-term funding rates and open interest are flashing warning signs. But what exactly do these metrics mean for the average crypto investor? Short-Term Funding Rates: These rates reflect the cost of borrowing Bitcoin in the derivatives market. Elevated funding rates can indicate an overheated market, potentially setting the stage for a correction. Think of it like borrowing costs getting too high, signaling that the party might be ending soon. Open Interest: This represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, like futures and options. A surge in open interest, especially when combined with high funding rates, can amplify price swings in either direction. It’s like more fuel being added to the fire, making the market more reactive to news and events. So, while Bitcoin’s recent performance has been encouraging, these technical indicators suggest we might be entering a period of heightened price fluctuations. Staying informed and prepared is key in such times. Tariffs and Economic Tremors: How They Impact Crypto Beyond the crypto-specific indicators, broader economic factors are also casting a shadow of uncertainty. U.S. tariffs are increasingly becoming a point of concern, applying pressure on manufacturing and contributing to inflationary pressures. But how do tariffs on goods translate to potential tariffs economy impact on the crypto market? Here’s a breakdown: Inflationary Pressure: Tariffs can lead to higher prices for imported goods, which can feed into overall inflation. In an inflationary environment, investors often look for alternative assets to preserve their purchasing power. Historically, some investors have viewed Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, although this narrative is still evolving. Economic Slowdown: Tariffs can disrupt supply chains, increase costs for businesses, and potentially slow down economic growth. Economic uncertainty can lead to risk-off sentiment in markets, which could impact both traditional equities and cryptocurrencies. Dollar Strength: The impact of tariffs on the US dollar is complex and can vary. A stronger dollar can sometimes negatively impact risk assets like Bitcoin, while a weaker dollar might provide a boost. The interplay between tariffs, inflation, and economic growth is a complex web, and its impact on the crypto market is not always direct or predictable. However, it’s crucial to be aware of these macroeconomic currents as they can indirectly influence investor sentiment and market dynamics. The Rise of Crypto Adoption : Japan Leads the Charge Amidst these economic and market uncertainties, the underlying trend of crypto adoption continues to advance globally. Positive developments are happening on multiple fronts, signaling the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. One notable example is Japan’s move to ease crypto tax rules. This is a significant step towards making crypto more accessible and attractive to Japanese investors. Tax clarity is often a major hurdle for widespread adoption, and Japan’s proactive approach is a positive signal for the industry. Here’s why Japan’s tax easing matters: Increased Retail Participation: Simpler tax rules can encourage more retail investors to participate in the crypto market without the fear of complex tax implications. Attracting Innovation: A favorable regulatory environment can attract crypto businesses and innovation to Japan, fostering growth within the domestic crypto ecosystem. Global Influence: Japan has historically been a forward-thinking nation in technology adoption. Its positive stance on crypto can influence other countries to adopt more crypto-friendly policies. Japan’s example highlights how regulatory clarity and supportive policies can be catalysts for crypto adoption on a larger scale. Crypto Finance Convergence : Spot Solana ETF and Tokenized Treasuries Perhaps one of the most compelling narratives in the crypto space right now is the growing crypto finance convergence – the integration of blockchain technology and digital assets into traditional financial systems. We’re seeing this convergence manifest in exciting ways, from spot ETFs to tokenized real-world assets. Grayscale’s filing for a spot Solana ETF is a prime example. Following the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the industry is eagerly anticipating the expansion of these investment vehicles to other cryptocurrencies. A spot Solana ETF would provide investors with regulated and easily accessible exposure to Solana, a prominent blockchain platform. Key benefits of a Spot Solana ETF: Benefit Description Accessibility Opens Solana investment to a wider range of investors through traditional brokerage accounts. Regulation Provides a regulated and potentially safer investment avenue compared to holding Solana directly. Mainstream Adoption Further legitimizes Solana and the broader crypto market within traditional finance. Simultaneously, BlackRock’s tokenized treasury fund is gaining significant traction, showcasing another facet of crypto finance convergence . Tokenization of real-world assets, like treasury bills, brings the efficiency and transparency of blockchain to traditional financial instruments. BlackRock’s dominance in this space underscores the growing institutional interest in tokenization. The rise of tokenized treasuries highlights: Real-World Utility: Tokenization bridges the gap between digital assets and tangible assets, demonstrating the practical applications of blockchain beyond cryptocurrencies. Institutional Acceptance: The involvement of major players like BlackRock signals that traditional financial institutions are increasingly embracing blockchain technology. Future of Finance: Tokenization paves the way for a more efficient, transparent, and potentially more accessible financial system. Navigating the Volatility and Embracing the Convergence The crypto market is at an interesting crossroads. On one hand, we’re facing potential Bitcoin volatility driven by market dynamics and macroeconomic factors like tariffs. On the other hand, we’re witnessing remarkable progress in crypto adoption and the exciting crypto finance convergence . This duality presents both challenges and opportunities. Actionable Insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on market indicators, economic news, and regulatory developments. Manage Risk: In periods of potential volatility, consider risk management strategies like portfolio diversification and position sizing. Embrace Innovation: Explore the opportunities emerging from crypto adoption and the convergence of crypto and traditional finance. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that crypto is a long-term game. Short-term volatility is part of the journey. Focus on the underlying trends and the evolving landscape. Conclusion: A Thrilling Chapter for Crypto The current crypto landscape is dynamic and full of potential. While Bitcoin volatility might bring short-term turbulence, the long-term trajectory of crypto adoption and crypto finance convergence remains incredibly promising. From Japan’s progressive tax policies to Grayscale’s ETF filings and BlackRock’s tokenization initiatives, the pieces are falling into place for a more integrated and mature crypto ecosystem.

The Freedom of Information Act lawsuit was filed by James Murphy, who based his accusations on claims made by DHS Special Agent Rana Saoud at a conference in April 2019, where she said a few of her colleagues had previously met with four people involved in creating Bitcoin. “My FOIA lawsuit simply asks for the notes, email and other documents relating to that alleged interview,” Murphy posted to X after announcing the April 7 suit. “IF the interview really happened as the DHS Agent claimed, there should be documentation of the substance of that meeting,” added Murphy, who goes by MetaLawMan on X. Source: James Murphy Speaking at the OffshoreAlert Conference North America in Miami in April 2019, Saoud said DHS agents met with the four people it believed to have created Bitcoin, asking what their motives were and what the “end game” is for Bitcoin. “The agents flew to California and they realized that he wasn’t alone in creating this, there were three other people, they sat down and talked with them to find out how this actually works and what the reason for it was,” Saoud said in the presentation, which is available on YouTube. If the DHS resists disclosure, Murphy said he will “pursue the case to conclusion” to solve the mystery. Murphy, however, noted that it is possible that Saoud and the other DHS agents were mistaken and did not interview the real Satoshi Nakamoto. Related: Satoshi Nakamoto turns 50 as Bitcoin becomes US reserve asset Murphy is being assisted by former Assistant US Attorney Brian Field, who specializes in Freedom of Information Act litigation. The purpose of the Freedom of Information Act is to promote transparency and accountability by granting the public access to information held by the government. Efforts to identify Satoshi Nakamoto have failed The lawsuit follows a wave of recent efforts attempting to uncover Satoshi’s identity. Last October, a controversial HBO documentary claimed that Peter Todd, a Bitcoin cypherpunk, invented Bitcoin. Todd refuted that conclusion, and most industry pundits said HBO’s evidence was weak. Nick Szabo, Adam Back and Hal Finney have also had their names tied to Satoshi’s identity. Szabo and Back regularly refute claims they’re Satoshi, as did Finney before he died in 2013. Meanwhile, members of the Bitcoin community are split on whether unveiling Satoshi’s identity would be a net positive for Bitcoin. Some worry that revealing Satoshi's identity could compromise Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos and put Satoshi’s safety at risk, while others want to be reassured that Bitcoin wasn’t created by the US government.

SOL Strategies Expands Stake Through Validator Acquisitions The company’s most transformative move was acquiring three prominent Solana validators , including the highly respected Laine validator and the validator analytics platform Stakewiz.com. The $24 million transaction was finalized on March 17 and marked a 102% increase in the company’s total SOL stake, which now stands at 3,351,617 SOL (approximately $388 million). Accompanying the acquisition was the addition of Laine’s founder, Michael Hubbard, to SOL Strategies’ executive team as Chief Strategy Officer. Hubbard, known for his technical expertise in the Solana ecosystem , is now spearheading the expansion of validator infrastructure and high-value institutional partnerships. The validator acquisition also introduced key performance enhancements. SOL Strategies reported 99.955% uptime across all validators and delivered an average APY of 7.41% to delegators, outperforming the network average. Key Validators Align Behind SIMD-228, but Proposal Falls Short Beyond validator operations, the company actively participated in the vote on SIMD-228 , a pivotal proposal to reduce Solana’s inflation rate from 4.5% to 0.87%.

This strategic IBM acquisition underscores the company’s aggressive push to expand its AI consulting capabilities and deliver enhanced value to its clients. Let’s dive into how this deal is set to reshape the landscape of enterprise AI solutions. Why IBM is Doubling Down on AI Consulting? IBM’s acquisition of Hakkoda is not an isolated event but rather a continuation of its determined investment in the burgeoning field of AI. This year alone, IBM has already made significant strides, acquiring DataStax, an AI application platform, and finalizing the purchase of HashiCorp, an infrastructure and security automation firm. These moves collectively highlight IBM’s strategic vision to become a dominant force in the Enterprise AI market. But why this relentless focus on AI? The answer lies in the numbers. IBM’s Q4 2024 earnings report showcased the power of AI, with the company experiencing its most substantial revenue surge in five years – a remarkable 10% jump in stock value. Furthermore, IBM reported over $5 billion in AI bookings and sales since inception, primarily driven by its thriving consulting business. This financial success story validates IBM’s strategy and fuels its further expansion into the AI domain. Hakkoda: The Perfect Piece for IBM’s AI Puzzle?

Hakkoda’s expertise spans across: Data Migration: Seamlessly moving vast datasets to the cloud. Data Transformation: Refining and reshaping raw data into actionable insights. Data Modernization: Upgrading legacy data systems to future-proof architectures. With a portfolio of tools and a client-centric approach, Hakkoda has garnered significant traction, raising $5.6 million in venture capital from firms like Tercera and Lead Edge Capital. Their deep understanding of data management and cloud technologies makes them an ideal partner for IBM as it seeks to bolster its Data and AI consulting services. What Does Hakkoda Bring to IBM’s AI Arsenal? The acquisition of Hakkoda injects several key advantages into IBM’s consulting division: Expanded Talent Pool: Hakkoda brings hundreds of experienced consultants located across the U.S., Latin America, India, Europe, and the UK, significantly augmenting IBM Consulting’s global reach and expertise. Deep Snowflake Expertise: Hakkoda’s specialization in the Snowflake data cloud strengthens IBM’s capabilities in this increasingly popular platform, enabling them to better serve clients leveraging Snowflake. Industry Focus: Hakkoda’s proven track record in industries like financial services, public sector, and healthcare aligns perfectly with IBM’s strategic client segments, promising immediate synergy and impact. Asset-Centric Delivery: Hakkoda’s approach to solution delivery, emphasizing reusable assets and accelerators, will enable IBM to deliver faster, more efficient, and cost-effective AI solutions to its clients. Unlocking Value for Clients Through Enhanced AI Consulting Mohamad Ali, SVP and head of IBM’s consulting business, emphasized that this acquisition is about delivering faster value to clients undergoing AI transformation. By integrating Hakkoda’s specialized data expertise with IBM’s global consulting infrastructure, the combined entity promises to: Accelerate AI Adoption: Streamline the process for businesses to integrate AI into their operations. Drive Data-Driven Decisions: Empower clients with robust data foundations for informed strategic choices. Enhance Business Outcomes: Deliver tangible improvements in efficiency, innovation, and competitive advantage through AI-powered solutions. Erik Duffield, Hakkoda’s co-founder, echoed this sentiment, highlighting the perfect alignment between Hakkoda’s industry-focused modern data consulting and IBM’s heritage of innovation and deep client partnerships. This union aims to propel Hakkoda’s expertise onto the global stage, shaping the future of data-driven transformation. The Future is AI-Powered Consulting IBM’s acquisition of Hakkoda is a powerful testament to the growing importance of AI in the enterprise landscape.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is stepping into the arena for a crucial public discussion that could significantly shape the future landscape of digital assets. Get ready for the “Between a Block and a Hard Place: Tailoring Regulation for Crypto Trading” roundtable, scheduled for April 11. This isn’t just another regulatory meeting; it’s a pivotal moment where public voices will contribute to the ongoing dialogue surrounding crypto regulation . Why is this Public Roundtable on Crypto Regulation a Big Deal? In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, clarity in crypto regulation is paramount. Currently, the industry navigates a complex web of existing laws, often designed for traditional financial instruments, not the decentralized and innovative nature of digital assets. This roundtable, spearheaded by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, signals a proactive approach to bridge this gap. It’s an opportunity to move away from ambiguity and towards a regulatory framework that fosters innovation while protecting investors. Think of it as a vital step in maturing the crypto space – from the Wild West to a structured, yet dynamic ecosystem. Here’s why you should pay close attention: Direct Public Input: Unlike many regulatory processes that happen behind closed doors, this roundtable is designed for public participation. Your voice, whether you’re a developer, investor, or simply curious, can contribute to shaping the future rules of the game. SEC Leadership Engagement: Key officials from the SEC will be present, listening and engaging. This demonstrates a serious commitment from the regulatory body to understand the nuances of crypto trading and the broader crypto ecosystem. Clarity on Crypto Trading Regulations: The title itself, “Between a Block and a Hard Place,” hints at the delicate balance the SEC is trying to strike – fostering innovation while managing risks. The discussions will likely delve into the challenges and opportunities in regulating crypto trading platforms, decentralized finance (DeFi), and more. Live and Accessible: The event will be held at the SEC headquarters and, importantly, streamed live online. This accessibility ensures that anyone, anywhere, can tune in and stay informed about these critical discussions. Hester Peirce Leading the Charge: A Crypto-Friendly Approach? Commissioner Hester Peirce, often dubbed “Crypto Mom” within the industry, is at the forefront of this initiative. Known for her generally pro-crypto stance and advocacy for regulatory clarity, her leadership of this public roundtable is a reassuring sign for many. Peirce has consistently emphasized the need for thoughtful regulation that doesn’t stifle innovation. Her involvement suggests that the SEC is genuinely seeking to understand the industry and create rules that are both effective and conducive to growth. However, it’s crucial to remember that Commissioner Peirce is just one voice within the SEC, and the roundtable is a collective effort to gather diverse perspectives. What to Expect at the Public Roundtable? While the specific agenda is yet to be fully detailed, we can anticipate discussions revolving around several critical areas of crypto regulation and crypto trading . Expect conversations on: Defining Crypto Assets: Are cryptocurrencies securities, commodities, or something else entirely? Clear definitions are fundamental for applying appropriate regulations. Regulation of Crypto Exchanges: How should platforms facilitating crypto trading be regulated? What are the best practices for ensuring market integrity and investor protection? DeFi and Decentralization: The rise of decentralized finance poses unique regulatory challenges. How can regulators approach DeFi without undermining its core principles of decentralization and accessibility? Investor Protection: A primary concern for the SEC is safeguarding investors from fraud and manipulation in the crypto space. What measures are necessary to achieve this effectively? Innovation vs. Regulation: Striking the right balance between fostering innovation in the crypto sector and implementing necessary regulations is the central tightrope walk. How Can You Participate and Stay Informed? Even if you can’t be physically present at the SEC headquarters, participating in the public roundtable is still possible. Here’s how: Watch the Live Stream: The SEC will be streaming the event live on its official website. Keep an eye on the SEC website for the link and timing details as April 11 approaches. Follow Social Media: Track updates and discussions around the roundtable on social media platforms like Twitter using relevant hashtags such as #CryptoRegulation, #SECRoundtable, #CryptoTrading. Read Post-Event Summaries: After the event, numerous crypto news outlets (like us!) will provide summaries and analyses of the key discussions and takeaways from the public roundtable . The Road Ahead for Crypto Regulation This public roundtable is not the end of the regulatory journey, but rather a significant milestone. It represents a crucial step towards developing informed and effective crypto regulation in the United States. The insights gathered from this event will likely influence future policy decisions and potentially lead to clearer guidelines for the crypto industry. For anyone involved or interested in cryptocurrencies, understanding these regulatory developments is essential. The discussions on April 11 could very well shape the operational landscape for crypto businesses and the investment environment for years to come. Stay tuned for more updates as we approach the April 11th public roundtable . The future of crypto trading and the broader digital asset space could very well be influenced by the dialogues that unfold during this landmark event.

Breaking News: Trump Considers Tariff Pause According to a report from Walter Bloomberg on X (formerly Twitter), citing Kevin Hassett, Donald Trump is weighing a 90-day suspension of tariffs. However, there’s a crucial caveat: this pause would apply to all nations except China . This news is rapidly circulating and sparking discussions across financial markets, prompting us to examine the potential ramifications, especially within the context of crypto markets . Here’s a quick breakdown of the key points: Source: Walter Bloomberg report on X, attributed to Kevin Hassett. Proposal: 90-day tariff suspension. Exclusion: China is explicitly excluded from this potential tariff pause. Impacted Nations: All countries excluding China could see a temporary reprieve from U.S. tariffs. Why a Tariff Pause? Understanding the Economic Policy Shift To grasp the significance of this potential economic policy shift, it’s essential to understand the context. Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, were a cornerstone of Trump’s trade strategy during his presidency. These measures were primarily aimed at protecting domestic industries and addressing trade imbalances, particularly with China. However, tariffs also have wide-ranging consequences, affecting businesses, consumers, and international relations. Here’s why a tariff pause might be considered now: Economic Slowdown Concerns: Globally, there are growing concerns about economic slowdown. A tariff pause could be seen as a measure to stimulate economic activity by reducing costs for businesses and consumers. Inflationary Pressures: Tariffs can contribute to inflation by increasing the cost of imported goods. Suspending tariffs, even temporarily, could help ease inflationary pressures. Geopolitical Strategy: Excluding China while offering a pause to other nations could be a strategic move to strengthen alliances and exert pressure on China. It could be interpreted as a nuanced approach to global trade relations. Market Sentiment: A tariff pause could be perceived positively by financial markets, boosting investor confidence and potentially leading to a positive market reaction . Impact on Global Trade and Beyond The implications of a 90-day tariff pause extend far beyond just the immediate financial markets. Let’s explore some potential impacts on global trade and related sectors: Area of Impact Potential Positive Effects Potential Challenges Businesses Reduced import costs, increased competitiveness for businesses relying on imported materials, potentially higher profits. Uncertainty about the duration of the pause, continued tariffs on Chinese goods may still disrupt supply chains for some. Consumers Potentially lower prices on imported goods, easing cost of living pressures. Limited impact if the pause is short-lived, benefits might not be immediately noticeable. International Relations Improved relations with nations (excluding China) benefiting from the pause, potential for stronger trade partnerships. Possible strain in relations with China, who remains under tariff pressure, could escalate trade tensions in the long run. Crypto Markets Positive sentiment in broader markets could spill over to crypto, increased risk appetite among investors, potential for capital inflow into crypto assets. Crypto market volatility is influenced by many factors, tariff pause is just one piece of the puzzle, impact might be short-term and overshadowed by other events. Crypto Market Reaction: Will We See a Surge? Now, for the question on everyone’s mind in the crypto space: how will this potential tariff pause affect crypto markets ? While the direct link might not be immediately obvious, global economic events often have ripple effects across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Here’s a look at potential scenarios for market reaction in the crypto world: Positive Market Sentiment: If the tariff pause is interpreted as a positive sign for the global economy, it could boost overall market sentiment. This positive sentiment could extend to the crypto market, leading to increased buying activity. Risk-On Environment: Reduced trade tensions might encourage a “risk-on” environment. In such environments, investors are often more willing to allocate capital to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. USD Impact: The U.S. dollar’s strength can be influenced by trade policies. A tariff pause might have a complex effect on the USD, which in turn can impact Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies often paired against the dollar. Inflation Hedge Narrative: If the tariff pause is seen as a measure to combat inflation (or if inflation concerns persist despite the pause), Bitcoin and other cryptos often touted as inflation hedges might see increased interest. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is driven by a multitude of factors, including technological developments, regulatory news, adoption rates, and broader macroeconomic trends. A tariff pause, while potentially influential, is just one piece of the puzzle. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Tariff Pause News So, what should crypto investors and enthusiasts do with this information? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Monitor news sources for further developments on this potential tariff pause. Confirmation and details are crucial. Analyze Market Sentiment: Observe how traditional financial markets react to this news. A positive reaction in stock markets could be a leading indicator for crypto. Assess Risk Tolerance: Consider your own risk tolerance. While a tariff pause could be a positive catalyst, crypto markets remain volatile. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification remains a key strategy in the crypto world, regardless of macroeconomic events. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that short-term market reactions might not always reflect long-term trends. Focus on the fundamentals of the crypto projects you are interested in. Conclusion: A Potential Turning Point or a Fleeting Pause? The news of a potential 90-day tariff pause, excluding China, is undoubtedly a significant development in the realm of global trade and economic policy . Whether it marks a genuine turning point in trade relations or simply a temporary reprieve remains to be seen. For crypto markets , it introduces another layer of complexity and potential opportunity. As always, staying informed, being adaptable, and maintaining a balanced perspective are crucial for navigating the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies.

The leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), has declined by more than 7% in the past 24 hours, and analysts predict further near-term challenges for the digital asset.​ US Tariffs Lead To Crypto Market Rout Notably, Trump’s baseline 10% tariffs on all countries went into effect on April 5, while the higher, country-specific reciprocal tariffs are scheduled to commence on April 9. These developments have raised fears of a global recession and widespread job losses.​ Related Reading: Shifting Sentiment? Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Stay Put Despite Losses The digital assets market has felt the impact of these tariffs, with BTC slipping over 7% in the past 24 hours – from approximately $82,300 on April 6, to a low of around $74,500 earlier today.​ Altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP have experienced even greater declines, tumbling by 17.2%, 16%, and 15.8% respectively over the past 24 hours. Similarly, the total crypto market capitalization has shed almost $130 billion during the same period.​ Commenting on BTC’s price action amid the market turmoil, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that there may be more challenges ahead for the leading digital asset, as it has flashed the infamous death cross on the daily chart, indicating the potential for further price pullbacks.​ For the uninitiated, a death cross is a bearish technical signal that appears when the 50-day moving average (MA) drops below the 200-day MA. It often suggests a potential downtrend or increased selling pressure in the market. Similarly, veteran trader Peter Brandt shared the following chart, showing BTC trading in a symmetrical triangle pattern, with a wedge retest located at $81,024. The trader hinted that BTC may follow a drop to the 50% retracement level of $54,000.​ To elaborate, ​a symmetrical triangle pattern in trading is a chart formation where the price consolidates with converging trend lines connecting a series of lower highs and higher lows, indicating a period of indecision before a potential breakout in either direction. Similarly, a wedge retest refers to the price action where, after breaking out from a wedge pattern – a formation with converging trend lines – the price returns to test the breakout level before continuing in the breakout direction. ​ An Opportunity To Stack Bitcoin? While heightened fears surrounding further price declines in BTC have unsettled investors and traders alike, some risk-seeking investors view this as an opportunity to accumulate more BTC at lower prices.​ Related Reading: Is a Bitcoin Rally Coming? Exchange Net Flow Data Suggests So For instance, CryptoQuant analyst BorisVest, in a recent analysis, emphasized that if BTC falls between $65,000 to $71,000, it could offer a favorable buying opportunity for investors with a decent risk-reward ratio. At press time, BTC trades at $76,678, down 7.5% in the past 24 hours.​ Featured image created with Unsplash, charts from X and TradingView.com",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|cryptocurrency|death cross|digital asset|ethereum|technical analysis|trade tariffs,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-04-08 00:30:19

Bitcoin , Solana , and Dogecoin are among the hardest hit. The massive sell-off has sparked fears of an impending collapse. Investors are left wondering which coins have the potential to bounce back. Is this the beginning of the end, or just another bump in the road? Dive in to find out which cryptos might recover. Bitcoin Price Analysis Amid Market Fluctuations Last month saw a drop of about 13.7%, while the previous six months delivered a strong rebound of 20.4%. Price shifts have been pronounced, with recent losses highlighting short-term bearish sentiment and long-term gains indicating underlying resilience. Historical swings have captured both steep declines and recovery spikes, reflecting the coin’s dynamic volatility. Current trading action revolves around a price range of roughly $73,941 to $93,783. Key support appears near $65,370, with the second support at $45,528. Resistance levels stand around $105,055, with the second resistance at $124,898. Bears seem to dominate as indicators lean negative; however, buying near support and selling close to resistance could be worthwhile strategies. Solana Price Performance and Trends Solana saw a steady decline over the past month and half-year, with prices dropping by around 30% in both periods. The downward trend has been consistent, with significant losses registered over six months. The coin’s performance has not shown any signs of a strong rebound, and overall sentiment remains cautious. The price action reflects a persistent bearish mood in recent periods, indicating a weakening trend. Current trading levels show prices oscillating between approximately $98 and $166, with support noted at $71 and resistance at $207. Bears currently dominate the market, with key indicators leaning negative. Traders might consider looking for buying opportunities near the support level, while they should approach targets above the resistance zone with caution until a clear trend reemerges. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Past Trends and Key Trading Zones Dogecoin prices dropped by 33.77% over the last month, accompanied by a 21.32% decline from the previous week. The last six months saw a rebound with a 22.66% gain, reflecting market volatility. These numbers highlight significant short-term weakness while suggesting a longer-term recovery may be underway, despite rapid sentiment changes. Current prices trade between $0.13 and $0.23, with a support level at $0.08 and resistance levels at $0.28 and $0.38. Bears are currently dominant, as momentum indicators and oscillators confirm recent downswings. Buyers may find opportunities near the support zone, while traders look for a clear move above the $0.28-cent resistance level for potential upside. Conclusion Bitcoin , Solana , and Dogecoin are experiencing sharp declines due to widespread selling. This has led to significant losses for investors. The current market trend suggests these cryptocurrencies are struggling. It's unclear how long this drop will last, but confidence has clearly been shaken. Right now, caution seems prudent. Markets need stability to regain momentum. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

43055120,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147067,1744072807,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Hopeful Turnaround: Over 90% of WazirX Creditors Approve Post-Hack Restructuring Plan,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/wazirx-creditors-approve-restructuring/,"In a significant development for the Indian crypto space, WazirX, one of the nation’s leading crypto exchanges, has received a resounding vote of confidence from its creditors. Following a substantial security breach last year, which sent ripples through the crypto community, WazirX has been diligently working on a restructuring plan to address the aftermath and pave the way for a robust recovery. The latest news brings a wave of optimism as a vast majority of creditors have given their nod to this plan, signaling a potential turning point for the exchange and its users. Unpacking the Creditor Approval: What Does 90% Mean for WazirX’s Restructuring Plan? The numbers speak volumes. According to reports from Cointelegraph, an overwhelming 93% of WazirX’s creditors, representing a staggering 94.6% of the total value owed, have given their thumbs up to the proposed restructuring strategy. This near-unanimous approval underscores a strong belief among creditors in WazirX’s ability to navigate through the challenges posed by the hack and emerge stronger. But what exactly does this approval entail, and how will it impact WazirX users? Let’s break down the key aspects: Strong Mandate: Securing over 90% approval is a powerful mandate. It demonstrates widespread support for the proposed course of action and reduces potential roadblocks in implementation. Value Representation: The fact that 94.6% of the value is represented in the approval signifies that even the larger creditors are on board. This is crucial for the financial viability and effectiveness of the restructuring. User Reassurance: This news is likely to be a significant source of relief for WazirX users. It suggests a clear path forward for the exchange to address the liabilities arising from the hack and work towards restoring normalcy. The $235 Million Hack: A Recap of the Challenge Faced by the Crypto Exchange To truly appreciate the significance of this creditor approval, it’s essential to revisit the incident that triggered the restructuring plan in the first place. Last year, WazirX experienced a substantial security breach, resulting in losses estimated at a hefty $235 million. In the volatile world of crypto exchange platforms, security is paramount, and such incidents can severely erode user trust and financial stability. The hack presented WazirX with a multifaceted challenge: Financial Strain: A $235 million loss is a massive financial blow to any organization. It necessitated a comprehensive strategy to address the deficit and ensure the exchange’s continued operation. Reputational Damage: Security breaches can significantly damage a crypto exchange’s reputation. Regaining user trust and confidence becomes a critical priority for long-term survival. Operational Disruption: Dealing with the aftermath of a hack requires significant operational adjustments, including security enhancements, legal compliance, and communication with affected users and stakeholders. Faced with these daunting challenges, WazirX embarked on formulating a robust restructuring plan , the cornerstone of which is now validated by the overwhelming creditor approval. Repayment Roadmap: How Will WazirX Deliver on its Commitments? The burning question on everyone’s mind is – when and how will users see their funds returned? WazirX has indicated that the repayment process is slated to commence as early as this month. The exchange is banking on a two-pronged approach to fulfill its repayment obligations: Asset Recovery: A key component of the plan involves active efforts to recover the assets lost in the hack. While the specifics of the recovery strategy are not fully detailed, successful asset recovery would directly contribute to the repayment pool. Profit-Sharing Mechanisms: Beyond asset recovery, WazirX intends to utilize profit-sharing mechanisms to generate funds for repayment. This suggests that a portion of the exchange’s future profits will be allocated towards fulfilling creditor obligations. While the promise of repayment starting this month is encouraging, users will be keenly watching for concrete details on the repayment schedule, the proportion of funds to be repaid, and the mechanisms involved. Transparency and clear communication will be crucial in maintaining user confidence throughout this process. Benefits of the Restructuring Plan: A Win-Win Scenario? The successful creditor approval and the impending repayment plan offer several potential benefits, not just for WazirX but also for the wider Indian crypto ecosystem: User Confidence Boost: A clear path to repayment can significantly restore user confidence in WazirX and, by extension, in the Indian crypto exchange landscape. Demonstrating responsibility and a commitment to user funds is paramount for the industry’s growth. Financial Stability for WazirX: The restructuring plan, if effectively implemented, can put WazirX on a more stable financial footing. Resolving the liabilities from the hack allows the exchange to focus on future growth and innovation. Positive Regulatory Signals: Successful navigation of this crisis by WazirX could send positive signals to regulators, demonstrating the industry’s capacity to address challenges and prioritize user protection. However, it’s important to acknowledge that the road ahead is not without its challenges. Challenges and Considerations: Navigating the Path to Full Recovery While the creditor approval is a major milestone, WazirX still faces several hurdles in its journey to full recovery: Asset Recovery Uncertainty: The success of asset recovery efforts is not guaranteed. Recovering stolen crypto assets can be a complex and lengthy process, with no assurance of full retrieval. Profitability Pressure: Relying on profit-sharing for repayment puts pressure on WazirX to achieve and sustain profitability in a competitive and often volatile market. Market fluctuations and regulatory changes could impact profitability projections. Execution Risk: Effective implementation of the restructuring plan is critical. Delays, unforeseen complications, or operational challenges could hinder the repayment process and erode user trust. Long-term User Trust: While repayment is a crucial step, rebuilding long-term user trust requires sustained efforts in enhancing security measures, ensuring platform stability, and maintaining transparent communication. Actionable Insights for WazirX Users and the Crypto Community What are the key takeaways from this development, and what should users and the broader crypto community be mindful of? Stay Informed: WazirX users should closely monitor official announcements from the exchange regarding the repayment plan , timelines, and procedures. Manage Expectations: While the news is positive, it’s prudent to manage expectations regarding the pace and extent of repayment. Asset recovery and profit-sharing are processes that take time and are subject to market conditions. Security Awareness: This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of security in the crypto space. Users should prioritize security best practices, such as using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and being vigilant against phishing attempts. Industry Resilience: The WazirX situation highlights both the vulnerabilities and the resilience of the crypto exchange industry. It underscores the need for robust security frameworks, proactive risk management, and transparent communication in the face of challenges. Conclusion: A Ray of Hope for WazirX and Indian Crypto? The overwhelming creditor approval for WazirX’s restructuring plan is undoubtedly a positive development. It offers a ray of hope for the exchange, its users, and potentially for the Indian crypto market as a whole. The commitment to begin repayments this month, coupled with asset recovery and profit-sharing mechanisms, signals a serious effort to address the aftermath of the hack and rebuild trust. While challenges remain and the path to full recovery will require sustained effort and transparency, this milestone marks a significant step forward for WazirX. The crypto community will be watching closely to see how the repayment plan unfolds and whether WazirX can successfully navigate these turbulent waters to emerge as a stronger and more resilient platform.

43055458,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147069,1744073453,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Price: Sudden Plunge Shocks Crypto Market as BTC Dips After Touching $79,472 Amid Rising Volatility",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-sudden-plunge/,"Buckle up, crypto enthusiasts! The digital currency rollercoaster just took another unexpected dip. Bitcoin, the king of cryptocurrencies, experienced a sudden plunge , dropping 1.52% in a mere five minutes after almost kissing the $80,000 mark. Just when optimism was peaking, the market threw a curveball, reminding us of the inherent crypto volatility that defines this exciting, yet unpredictable, asset class. Let’s dive into what happened and what it means for you. Understanding Bitcoin Price Volatility: The Heartbeat of Crypto Bitcoin price movements are rarely linear. If you’ve been around the crypto block even for a short while, you know that volatility isn’t just a buzzword – it’s the very pulse of the cryptocurrency market . But what exactly does crypto volatility mean, and why should you care? Inherent Nature: Unlike traditional assets, the cryptocurrency market operates 24/7, globally, with relatively less regulation (depending on jurisdiction). This always-on, loosely governed nature contributes significantly to price swings. News, social media sentiment, regulatory announcements, and even tweets can trigger rapid market reactions. Supply and Demand Dynamics: Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million coins. This scarcity, coupled with fluctuating demand, can lead to dramatic Bitcoin price changes. Increased demand with limited supply often pushes prices up rapidly, while fear or negative news can trigger swift sell-offs, causing prices to plummet. Market Sentiment: The cryptocurrency market is heavily influenced by sentiment. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) and Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) play significant roles. Positive news can ignite FOMO-driven buying sprees, while negative news can trigger panic selling, amplifying crypto volatility . Decoding the Recent BTC Price Drop: A 5-Minute Rollercoaster The headline screams BTC Price Drop – a 1.52% fall in just five minutes. Let’s break down what this means and put it into perspective: Metric Value Peak Price (Before Drop) $79,472.02 Price at Time of Drop $78,265.99 Percentage Drop (5 minutes) 1.52% Trading Platform Binance USDT Market Current Trading Price $78,265.99 (at time of writing) While a 1.52% drop might seem alarming at first glance, especially in such a short timeframe, it’s crucial to remember the context of the cryptocurrency market . In traditional stock markets, a 1% move is significant. In crypto, such fluctuations are almost routine. However, the speed of this BTC Price Drop – 1.52% in five minutes – does warrant attention and raises questions about potential triggers: Whale Activity: Large holders of Bitcoin, often referred to as “whales,” can significantly influence the market. A large sell order from a whale can trigger a cascade effect, leading to a rapid Bitcoin price decline. Leverage and Liquidations: The highly leveraged nature of some crypto trading platforms can amplify price movements. A small BTC Price Drop can trigger liquidation cascades, where leveraged positions are automatically closed, further pushing the price down. Market Sentiment Shift: News, rumors, or even social media buzz can quickly shift market sentiment. A piece of negative news, even if unfounded, can spark fear and selling pressure, contributing to crypto volatility . Profit Taking: After a period of upward price movement, some investors may choose to take profits. If a significant number of investors decide to sell simultaneously, it can lead to a BTC Price Drop . Navigating the Turbulent Cryptocurrency Market: Strategies for Traders and Investors So, how do you navigate the choppy waters of the cryptocurrency market and manage the inherent crypto volatility ? Here are some actionable insights: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market (which is notoriously difficult, especially with Bitcoin trading ), consider DCA. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the Bitcoin price . DCA helps to smooth out your entry price over time and reduces the risk of investing a large sum right before a BTC Price Drop . Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Given the crypto volatility , portfolio diversification is key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially in a single cryptocurrency. Consider allocating a portion of your investment to less volatile assets. Stay Informed, But Don’t Panic: Keep up-to-date with news and market trends in the cryptocurrency market , but avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term price fluctuations. Bitcoin trading requires a cool head. Separate noise from signal. Use Stop-Loss Orders: For active traders, stop-loss orders can be a valuable tool to limit potential losses during periods of high crypto volatility . A stop-loss order automatically sells your assets if the price drops to a predetermined level. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that Bitcoin price has historically been volatile but has also shown significant long-term growth. If you believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market , short-term dips can be viewed as buying opportunities rather than causes for panic. The Future of Bitcoin Trading Amidst Volatility: Opportunity or Challenge? Is crypto volatility a bug or a feature? For seasoned Bitcoin trading veterans, volatility is often seen as an opportunity. Price swings, while nerve-wracking for some, create chances for profit through trading. However, for newcomers, the cryptocurrency market ‘s volatility can be daunting. The future of Bitcoin trading will undoubtedly remain intertwined with volatility. As the market matures, we may see periods of reduced volatility, but the fundamental factors that drive price fluctuations – supply and demand, sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological advancements – will continue to shape the Bitcoin price landscape. The recent BTC Price Drop serves as a timely reminder: the cryptocurrency market is dynamic and unpredictable.

As SHIB continues to trade at $0.000012, a significant portion of its investor base is redirecting their funds into MUTM. Currently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is catching serious attention for its innovative blockchain solutions and strong early adoption. The project is currently priced at $0.025 per token in phase 4 of its presale. The project has already raised over $6.3 million and has attracted more than 7900 holders within days. This could be your second chance at life-changing gains. Phase 5 prices will spike with 20% to $0.03 and holders joining at this stage stand a 140% ROI when it launches at $0.06. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Traction Investors flock to Mutuum Finance due to its revolutionary decentralized finance model for crypto loans while decentralization funds its innovative financial services. The project maintains a rising momentum since it has raised over $6.3 million in investments and now attracts more than 7900 investors. The Phase 4 token price at $0.025 presents investors with a limited opportunity as an upcoming 20% price boost charts the completion of early investment entry. Potential investors who join during the presale period could earn 140% ROI since the token has defined a listing price at $0.06. As the Decentralized market grows, Mutuum Finance is leading the charge with its groundbreaking lending model and solid market positioning. The Mutuum Finance team is currently having its smart contract audited by CertiK, a crucial step in ensuring security and trust. Once finalized, the official audit report will be shared on their social media platforms. Transforming Crypto Lending with a Dual-Model System Mutuum Finance offers a modern lending platform that joins Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models for better access to assets as well as transparency and user empowerment. Through the Peer-to-Contract model users can add stablecoins to smart contract pools to earn passive income as they instantly allow borrowing access to platform users. Smart contracts manage automatic interest rate adjustments that provide enhanced earnings for lenders at reduced borrowing expenses. When people utilize the P2P model they create immediate lending relationships free of intermediaries that fulfill decentralization goals and let users exercise complete negotiation capabilities. Borrowers together with lenders operate in a system which offers complete transparency and efficiency to form custom agreements for loan transactions creating enhanced user-centric borrowing situations. The Mutuum Finance stablecoin functions on Ethereum by keeping stable prices through USD fund reservations. Financial transactions rely on this stablecoin system because it uses a resistant structure which prevents algorithmic stability problems. The combination of next-generation financial lending approaches with robust infrastructure elements enables Mutuum Finance to create the path for decentralized finance development. Giveaway Mutuum Finance continues to grow its community base through the provision of attractive monetary benefits. The giveaway campaign provides $10,000 MUTM tokens to 10 randomly selected winners throughout the program which has one million dollars in prizes. Simultaneously the new investor referral program exists to reward users for new investor acquisitions. Demographic participants gain access to unique staking pools in addition to governance privileges and update services which fosters extended commitment to the platform. The growing interest from Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) raises an intriguing question: what do they know that we don’t? As SHIB continues its price fluctuations, many of its investors are redirecting their funds into Mutuum Finance, a promising DeFi project that has already raised over $6.3 million and attracted more than 7,900 investors during its Phase 4 presale. For those looking to secure an investment in the next big DeFi opportunity, joining the Mutuum Finance presale before Phase 5 could be the move that sets them up for gains.

They’ve announced plans for multiple rounds of TT token buybacks , sending a strong signal of confidence in their ecosystem and commitment to their community. Let’s dive into what this means for ThunderCore, the TT token, and the broader cryptocurrency landscape. What’s the Buzz About ThunderCore’s Token Buyback? ThunderCore made the announcement via X, detailing their intention to buy back TT tokens within a price range of $0.002 to $0.01. This isn’t just a one-off event; the mention of ‘multiple rounds’ suggests a sustained effort to support the TT token and potentially influence its market dynamics. But what exactly is a token buyback, and why is it significant in the world of cryptocurrency? Think of a token buyback like a company buying back its own shares in the traditional stock market. In the crypto context, when a project like ThunderCore initiates a token buyback , it essentially means they are using their own funds to purchase TT tokens from the open market. This can have several implications: Reduced Supply: By taking tokens out of circulation, buybacks can decrease the overall supply of TT tokens available in the market. Basic economics tells us that reduced supply, with consistent or increasing demand, can potentially lead to price appreciation. Increased Scarcity: A buyback can create a sense of scarcity around the cryptocurrency , making it potentially more attractive to hold. Sign of Confidence: When a project invests its own resources to buy back its tokens, it’s often interpreted as a strong signal of confidence in the project’s future prospects and the inherent value of its token. Price Support: The buyback mechanism can act as a price support level. In ThunderCore’s case, the specified price range of $0.002 to $0.01 indicates the levels at which they are willing to actively purchase TT tokens, potentially creating a floor for the price. ThunderCore: A Quick Look at the Blockchain Powerhouse For those less familiar, ThunderCore is an EVM-compatible public blockchain , which means it’s designed to be compatible with applications and smart contracts built for Ethereum. This compatibility is a significant advantage, allowing developers to easily port their Ethereum-based projects to ThunderCore and benefit from its features. ThunderCore aims to address some of the common challenges in the blockchain space, such as scalability and transaction speed. Here’s a quick rundown of ThunderCore’s key aspects: Feature Description EVM Compatibility Seamless integration with Ethereum Virtual Machine, enabling easy migration of Ethereum dApps. Scalability Designed for high transaction throughput, aiming to handle a large volume of transactions efficiently. Public Blockchain Open and permissionless, allowing anyone to participate in the network. TT Token The native cryptocurrency of the ThunderCore network, used for transaction fees, staking, and governance. Why is ThunderCore Opting for a TT Token Buyback Now? The timing of this token buyback announcement is noteworthy. In the often volatile world of cryptocurrency, such initiatives can be strategic moves. Here are a few potential reasons behind ThunderCore’s decision: Market Conditions: The current market conditions might be seen as opportune for a buyback. If ThunderCore believes the TT token is undervalued, a buyback at these levels could be considered a strategic investment. Community Support: Buybacks can be a way to show support for the community and token holders. It demonstrates that the project is invested in the success of its token and is willing to take action to bolster its value. Long-Term Vision: This move could be part of a broader long-term strategy to strengthen the ThunderCore ecosystem. By increasing the perceived value of the TT token , it could attract more users, developers, and investors to the platform. Tokenomics Management: Buybacks are also a tool for managing tokenomics. They can help in controlling inflation and ensuring a healthier token distribution over time. Decoding the Price Range: $0.002 to $0.01 The specified price range of $0.002 to $0.01 for the TT token buyback is an interesting detail. This range likely reflects ThunderCore’s assessment of the token’s current value and potential upside. By setting a range, they provide some transparency into their buyback strategy. It suggests they are prepared to buy tokens if the price falls within or below this range, potentially providing a safety net for token holders. It’s crucial to remember that while buybacks can be a positive catalyst, they are not a guaranteed path to price appreciation. The success of this initiative will depend on various factors, including overall market sentiment, the continued development and adoption of the ThunderCore blockchain , and the broader utility of the TT token within its ecosystem. What Does This Mean for the Future of TT Token and ThunderCore? ThunderCore’s announcement of multiple rounds of TT token buybacks is undoubtedly a positive development for the project and its community. It showcases a proactive approach to managing their token economy and a commitment to long-term growth. For holders of the TT token, this news could be seen as encouraging, potentially signaling a period of increased stability and potential upside. However, as with any investment in the cryptocurrency space, it’s essential to conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved. While buybacks can be a positive indicator, they are just one piece of the puzzle. The long-term success of ThunderCore and the TT token will depend on continued innovation, adoption, and the overall health of the crypto market. Key Takeaways: ThunderCore announces multiple rounds of TT token buybacks in the range of $0.002 to $0.01. Token buybacks can reduce supply, increase scarcity, and signal confidence in a cryptocurrency project. ThunderCore is an EVM-compatible public blockchain focused on scalability and interoperability. The buyback initiative could be driven by market conditions, community support, and long-term strategic goals. While positive, the impact of buybacks depends on various market and project-specific factors. Looking Ahead: Is This a Turning Point for TT Token? Only time will tell if this buyback program will mark a significant turning point for the TT token . However, it’s clear that ThunderCore is taking decisive action to support its ecosystem and token holders. This move certainly adds an element of excitement and anticipation around the future of ThunderCore and its native cryptocurrency. For those invested in or considering investing in TT token, staying informed about the progress of these buyback rounds and the overall development of the ThunderCore ecosystem will be crucial. Keep an eye on official announcements and community discussions to stay updated on this evolving story. In conclusion, ThunderCore’s bold move to initiate multiple TT token buybacks is a noteworthy event in the cryptocurrency space. It reflects a project actively managing its token economy and demonstrating confidence in its future. Whether this translates to significant price appreciation for the TT token remains to be seen, but it undoubtedly injects a dose of optimism into the ThunderCore community and warrants close attention from the broader crypto world.

For those tracking the pulse of global finance, the US Dollar’s trajectory is always a critical factor. Bank of America (BofA), a financial heavyweight, recently released insights from its quantitative models, offering a glimpse into the near-term outlook for the dollar. But here’s the twist – it’s not a straightforward bullish or bearish signal. Instead, BofA’s analysis points to a mixed near-term outlook for the dollar , creating a landscape of uncertainty and potential opportunity for savvy traders and investors alike. Decoding BofA’s Quant Models: A Mixed Bag for the Dollar Bank of America’s quantitative models are sophisticated tools that analyze vast amounts of data to predict market movements. When these models signal a mixed outlook, it means that different indicators are pointing in different directions. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing; in fact, it can present a more nuanced and realistic picture of the complex forces influencing the US Dollar outlook . But what exactly does ‘mixed’ mean in this context? Let’s break down the key elements contributing to this ambiguous forecast: Conflicting Economic Signals: The global economy is currently a patchwork of strengths and weaknesses. While the US economy has shown resilience in certain sectors, concerns about inflation, interest rate hikes, and potential recession linger. BofA’s models are likely picking up on these conflicting signals, leading to an indecisive overall dollar prediction. Geopolitical Uncertainty: Global events play a significant role in currency valuations. Ongoing geopolitical tensions, trade disputes, and unexpected global events can inject volatility into the Forex market trends and impact the dollar’s perceived safe-haven status. These factors are inherently unpredictable, contributing to a mixed outlook. Technical Indicators: Technical analysis of price charts and trading volumes often provides clues about future price movements. If BofA’s quant models incorporate technical indicators, a mixed outlook could suggest that these indicators are not providing a clear consensus on the dollar’s direction. Some might be bullish, while others are bearish. Divergent Monetary Policies: Central banks around the world are pursuing different monetary policies in response to their unique economic challenges. The Federal Reserve’s actions, compared to those of the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, or the Bank of England, can create shifts in currency valuations. These policy divergences are likely factored into BofA’s Currency market analysis , contributing to the mixed signals. Why a Mixed Dollar Forecast Matters to You For those involved in the cryptocurrency space, understanding the Dollar forecast is crucial. The US Dollar remains the world’s reserve currency and a dominant force in global trade and finance. Its strength or weakness can have ripple effects across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Here’s why this mixed outlook should be on your radar: Cryptocurrency Volatility: A mixed dollar outlook often translates to increased volatility in the broader financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. Uncertainty about the dollar’s direction can lead to speculative trading and price swings in crypto assets. Trading Opportunities: Volatility, while risky, also presents opportunities. A mixed dollar outlook can create chances for traders to profit from short-term fluctuations in both the forex and crypto markets. Understanding the factors driving the dollar’s movements becomes even more critical in such an environment. Impact on Global Liquidity: The dollar’s strength influences global liquidity. A weaker dollar can sometimes inject liquidity into emerging markets and potentially into the crypto space. Conversely, a stronger dollar can tighten global financial conditions. A mixed outlook means this liquidity dynamic is less predictable. Safe-Haven Flows: The US Dollar is often considered a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty. If BofA’s models are indicating mixed signals due to underlying economic concerns, it raises questions about the dollar’s effectiveness as a safe haven in the near term. This could lead investors to explore alternative safe havens, potentially including certain cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Navigating the Forex Market Trends with a Mixed Dollar Outlook So, how do you navigate the Forex market trends when facing a mixed dollar forecast? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Strategy Description Benefits Challenges Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your portfolio across different currencies and asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Reduces risk, captures opportunities in different markets. Requires more research and monitoring across multiple markets. Technical Analysis: Utilize technical analysis tools and charts to identify potential trading opportunities based on price patterns and indicators. Helps identify short-term trends and potential entry/exit points. Technical analysis is not foolproof and requires skill and experience. Fundamental Analysis: Stay informed about macroeconomic data releases, central bank announcements, and geopolitical events that can influence the dollar and forex markets. Provides a deeper understanding of the underlying drivers of currency movements. Requires time and effort to analyze and interpret economic data. Risk Management: Implement robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders and managing position sizes, especially in volatile market conditions. Protects capital and minimizes potential losses. Requires discipline and adherence to a trading plan. Stay Informed: Continuously monitor market news and analysis from reputable sources like Bank of America and other financial institutions to stay updated on the evolving dollar outlook. Ensures you are making informed decisions based on the latest information. Requires filtering through vast amounts of information and identifying credible sources. Understanding Currency Market Analysis and BofA’s Perspective BofA’s Currency market analysis is highly regarded in the financial industry. Their quant models are built on sophisticated algorithms and vast datasets, providing valuable insights into potential market directions. However, it’s crucial to remember that even the most advanced models are not perfect predictors of the future. Market conditions can change rapidly, and unforeseen events can always disrupt even the most carefully crafted forecasts. When BofA signals a mixed outlook, it’s an acknowledgement of this inherent uncertainty. It’s not necessarily a sign of failure of their models, but rather a reflection of the complex and often unpredictable nature of the global financial landscape. Instead of viewing a mixed outlook as a lack of clarity, it should be seen as a call for caution, diligence, and a flexible trading approach. The Power of Uncertainty: Embracing the Mixed Signals In conclusion, Bank of America’s quant models are painting a picture of a mixed near-term outlook for the dollar . This isn’t a clear-cut bullish or bearish signal, but rather a nuanced perspective reflecting the various conflicting forces at play in the global economy and financial markets. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and forex traders, this uncertainty translates into both challenges and opportunities. By understanding the factors contributing to this mixed outlook, staying informed about Forex market trends , and employing sound risk management strategies, you can navigate this complex environment and potentially capitalize on the volatility that a mixed dollar forecast often brings. The key is to embrace the uncertainty, remain adaptable, and continuously refine your understanding of Currency market analysis to make informed decisions in this ever-evolving financial landscape.

The scammers would swindle victims up to three times. After stealing an initial sum through the investment scam , the fraudsters contacted victims twice more, masquerading as investment managers and then as authorities, offering to recover the stolen funds for a fee, Spanish police said in an April 7 statement. The scammers used deepfake ads of “national personalities” promising high returns on crypto investments, and would occasionally pose as financial advisers or even feign romantic interest to lure in victims. Experts have been warning of a rise in AI-enhanced scams. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said in its Feb. 13 Crypto Scam Revenue 2024 report that generative AI is making “scams more scalable and affordable for bad actors to conduct.” 🚩Detenidas seis personas por estafar más de 19 millones de euros usando #inteligenciaartificial 🔴Engañaban a las víctimas a través de anuncios manipulados con #IA para que realizaran inversiones con #criptomonedas en productos supuestamente muy rentables pic.twitter.com/rMrdgBpOYz — Policía Nacional (@policia) April 7, 2025 “Victims were not selected randomly; instead, algorithms selected those whose profiles matched the cybercriminals’ searches,” Spanish police said. “Once they selected their victims, they placed advertising campaigns on the websites or social networks they used, offering them cryptocurrency investments with high returns and zero risk of asset loss — investments that, obviously, turned out to be a scam.” When victims could not withdraw the funds, most realized it was a scam, according to Spanish police; however, the ruse didn’t end there. Scammers would trick victims again with follow-up scams The cybercriminals would then contact victims again, posing as investment managers , claiming the stolen funds were frozen and could be recovered if they paid a deposit. “The victims, hoping to finally recover their money, made the deposit without realizing they had been scammed again,” Spanish police said. The scammers would then contact victims a third time, this time posing as Europol agents or lawyers from the United Kingdom, offering to return the stolen funds if the victim paid the corresponding taxes in the country where it was blocked.

During a raid on the alleged leader behind the scam, Spanish authorities seized numerous cell phones, computers, hard drives, a simulated weapon and extensive documentation. Several people linked to the plot have also been identified in other countries , and the syndicate allegedly created a large number of fake companies to channel the stolen funds. “Furthermore, the members of the organization used multiple false identities. In the case of the leader, for example, he used more than 50 different identities,” Spanish police said. Magazine: Bitcoin heading to $70K soon?

Moonvalley, an innovative AI startup based in Los Angeles, has just announced a significant milestone. They’ve secured a fresh $43 million in funding, signaling strong investor confidence in the future of AI video technology. This substantial investment arrives hot on the heels of Moonvalley’s launch of their cutting-edge generative AI model, Marey, marking a pivotal moment in the rapidly evolving landscape of digital media. Why is Moonvalley’s $43M Funding a Big Deal for AI Video? This latest funding round, revealed in an SEC filing, includes 11 investors who remain unnamed for now. It’s important to note that while the filing indicates $43 million, Moonvalley hints that the final figure could be even higher. This injection of capital follows a previous seed funding round of $70 million, bringing their total funding to over $113 million – a testament to the immense potential seen in their AI video creation tools.

But did you know that the tech powering the next wave of digital art and content creation is also undergoing a massive transformation? Enter Krea, a startup making waves by securing a whopping $83 million to become the ultimate hub for genAI creatives . For those in the crypto space who are also visual artists, designers, or content creators, Krea’s mission to streamline the often-chaotic world of generative AI tools is something to watch. Feeling Overwhelmed by Generative AI Tools? Krea Offers a Solution If you’re a creative professional, you’ve likely experienced the whirlwind of new generative AI platform options popping up daily. Keeping track of which model does what, and how to best utilize them for your projects can be daunting. Krea steps in as a savior, aiming to simplify this complexity. Imagine a single platform where you can access a multitude of AI models through a user-friendly interface, specifically designed for visual creatives. This is the promise of Krea, and investors are betting big on their vision with an $83 million funding injection. Krea, based in San Francisco, has developed a “unified” platform, acting as a central command for various AI models. Their custom interface is engineered to make interactions with these models more intuitive and adaptable. Think of it as a universal remote for the ever-expanding universe of AI design tools . Early adopters from companies like Perplexity AI, LEGO, and Samsung are already on board, signaling strong industry validation. Decoding the $83 Million Krea Funding The $83 million isn’t just one lump sum; it’s a series of funding rounds that reflect Krea’s growing momentum and investor confidence. Let’s break down the Krea funding : Pre-seed/Seed: $3 million – Early stage funding to get the ball rolling. Series A: $33 million – Fueling initial growth and platform development. Series B: $47 million – Led by Bain Capital Ventures, this latest round signifies major expansion plans and a strong belief in Krea’s future. With a post-money valuation of $500 million, Krea is rapidly becoming a significant player in the creative AI space. Major investment firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Abstract Ventures are also backing Krea, highlighting the immense potential they see in the platform. From Barcelona to GenAI Revolution: The Founders’ Story Behind Krea are Victor Perez (CEO) and Diego Rodriguez (CTO), two kindred spirits who connected over a decade ago as students in Barcelona. Both consider themselves deeply rooted in the creative world – Perez in music and Rodriguez in visual arts – combined with a strong fascination for technology. “I was drawn to physics, maths, and any problem that challenged my mind,” Perez recalls about his student days. Their shared engineering background in audio-visual systems led them to explore the burgeoning field of AI. It was 2015, a pivotal year that saw the birth of OpenAI and the early stirrings of the generative AI revolution. After pursuing careers as AI researchers, they reunited at Cornell University, but the allure of building something transformative proved too strong. Perez’s vision for Krea sparked an immediate reaction in Rodriguez, leading them to drop out of their fellowships and embark on their entrepreneurial journey. Why Krea? Bridging the GenAI Gap for Creatives The problem Krea is tackling is acutely felt by designers and visual content creators today. The rapid proliferation of GenAI tools, while powerful, has created a fragmented and often confusing landscape. Here’s the core issue: Complexity for Designers: Designers aren’t necessarily prompt engineers. They want to focus on creativity, not the technical intricacies of AI interactions. Model Overload: Keeping up with the latest AI models and understanding their specific strengths and weaknesses is a full-time job in itself. Rapid Obsolescence: AI models are constantly being updated and surpassed, creating a sense of perpetual catch-up for users. Aaref Hilaly from Bain Capital Ventures perfectly summarizes Krea’s value proposition: “Each model is being leapfrogged very quickly by another one. Having a layer like Krea on top of all of them makes sense… They are getting the latest models with a great user experience.” Empowering Creative Sensibilities with AI Krea’s founders emphasize that their platform is built to understand and enhance the creative process, not replace it. They believe in empowering human creativity with AI, rather than automating it away. This philosophy is embedded in Krea’s platform: Users start by inputting their creative idea. Krea’s intelligent system then selects the most suitable AI models to bring that vision to life. The platform allows for iterative editing and refinement, ensuring the creator’s artistic input remains central. Unlike purely text-based “one-stop shops,” Krea’s ability to directly manipulate and refine generated images is a key differentiator. Rodriguez highlights this interactive approach: “Why isn’t it possible to go on an [AI-generated] image, and click and drag and drop something in or take something out? That’s how a painter would work.” Expanding Horizons: Video, Audio, and Enterprise Features Currently, Krea’s tools span still images and video, but their ambition extends further. The roadmap includes expanding into audio and music generation, making it a truly comprehensive creative suite. The new funding will also fuel the development of enterprise-grade features, catering to larger teams and organizations. Initially focused on individual creators and small teams, Krea is now setting its sights on broader industry adoption. Anish Acharya from Andreessen Horowitz aptly captures Krea’s essence: “Krea extends human creativity with a product that gives users full control without sacrificing power or craft. They’ve built a platform that moves at the speed of the best AI research but feels intuitive from day one.” The Future is Creative and AI-Powered Krea’s $83 million funding round signals a significant moment for the creative AI landscape. By simplifying access to diverse AI models and prioritizing user experience, Krea is poised to become an indispensable tool for designers and visual creators in the crypto world and beyond. As AI continues to evolve, platforms like Krea will be crucial in ensuring that these powerful technologies remain accessible and empowering for human creativity.

Recently, eagle-eyed on-chain analysts spotted a noteworthy movement involving crypto venture capital firm, Spartan Group . Wallet activity revealed a substantial deposit of Ethereum (ETH) to major exchanges, Binance and Coinbase . But what does this mean for the market, and why should crypto enthusiasts pay attention? Who is Spartan Group and Why Does Their Ethereum (ETH) Move Matter? Spartan Group isn’t just another name in the crypto space; it’s a well-established venture capital firm known for its strategic investments in blockchain technology and digital assets. Their portfolio spans across various sectors of the crypto ecosystem, making their on-chain activities closely watched by analysts and traders alike. When a firm like Spartan Group makes a move, especially involving a substantial amount of Ethereum (ETH) , it often signals something significant. It could be a strategic portfolio rebalancing, profit-taking, or even a shift in market outlook. Understanding the ‘why’ behind such transactions can offer valuable insights into potential market trends. Here’s why Spartan Group’s Ethereum (ETH) transaction is generating buzz: Size of the Transaction: 3,500 ETH , valued at approximately $5.22 million, is not a trivial amount. Such large transfers can influence market dynamics, especially for assets like Ethereum (ETH) . Destination Exchanges: Depositing funds to Binance and Coinbase , two of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, typically indicates an intention to sell or trade these assets. These platforms are known for their high liquidity and are preferred venues for large-volume transactions. Venture Capital Firm Activity: VC firms like Spartan Group often have a longer-term investment horizon. Their short-term actions can sometimes reflect shifts in their broader investment strategy or response to market conditions. Decoding the On-Chain Data: What Does the 3,500 ETH Deposit to Binance and Coinbase Tell Us? The on-chain data, highlighted by The Data Nerd on X (formerly Twitter), provides a transparent view into cryptocurrency transactions. The specific wallet, 0x770, linked to Spartan Group , sending 3,500 ETH to Binance and Coinbase , is a verifiable fact on the blockchain. But what are the possible interpretations of this data? Let’s break down the potential scenarios: Scenario Description Market Implication Profit Taking Spartan Group might be realizing profits from their Ethereum (ETH) holdings, especially if they acquired ETH at lower prices. Could indicate a potential short-term selling pressure on Ethereum (ETH) , depending on the broader market sentiment and demand. Portfolio Rebalancing The firm might be reallocating capital to other assets or projects within their portfolio. This could be due to strategic shifts or changes in investment thesis. May not directly impact Ethereum (ETH) price negatively in the long run, but signals a shift in Spartan Group’s asset allocation strategy. Preparing for New Investments Selling ETH could be a way for Spartan Group to raise capital for new investments in other crypto projects or to capitalize on emerging opportunities. Indirectly positive for the crypto space as it suggests continued investment activity from VC firms, albeit potentially in areas outside of Ethereum (ETH) for now. Hedging Market Risk In a volatile market, reducing exposure to certain assets like Ethereum (ETH) and increasing cash reserves or stablecoins can be a risk management strategy. Might reflect a cautious outlook on the market by Spartan Group , potentially signaling broader market uncertainty. Ethereum (ETH) Price Implications: Will This Deposit Trigger a Market Reaction? The immediate question on many traders’ minds is: will this 3,500 ETH deposit by Spartan Group impact the price of Ethereum (ETH) ? While a $5.22 million transaction is significant, the overall Ethereum (ETH) market is vast and highly liquid. Therefore, the direct impact might be limited, especially if the selling is spread out over time. However, the psychological impact and broader market sentiment play a crucial role. Potential Price Impact Factors: Market Sentiment: If the market is already bearish or experiencing negative momentum, a large deposit like this could exacerbate selling pressure. Conversely, in a bullish market, it might be absorbed with minimal price disruption. Trading Volume: The daily trading volume of Ethereum (ETH) on exchanges like Binance and Coinbase is enormous. A 3,500 ETH deposit, while substantial, is a small fraction of the total daily volume. Whale Watching: Traders and automated trading bots often monitor large wallet movements. If other ‘whales’ interpret this as a signal to sell, it could trigger a cascading effect, leading to increased selling pressure. Broader Market Context: External factors like macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, and overall crypto market trends will likely have a more significant influence on Ethereum (ETH) price than this single transaction. Navigating Crypto Whale Movements: Actionable Insights for Traders While predicting the exact market reaction to Spartan Group’s Coinbase and Binance deposits is challenging, understanding these movements provides valuable context for crypto traders. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed with On-Chain Data: Tools and analysts like The Data Nerd provide crucial real-time information about significant on-chain transactions. Following such sources can help you stay ahead of market-moving events. Consider the Broader Context: Don’t react solely to individual whale movements.

Over the past two weeks, Bitcoin has dropped by more than 10%, slipping under $75,000 earlier today—a level last seen in November 2024. The pullback coincides with broader market volatility coming from rising geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Amid this ongoing price move, a crypto analyst has suggested that the behavior of short-term holders during episodes like this is crucial in assessing the extent of ongoing market corrections. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dips Below $75K As Markets Tremble: What’s Going On? Short-Term Holders Show Early Signs of Stress According to CryptoQuant contributor Yonsei Dent, the current price action reveals important insights into investor behavior. Dent’s latest analysis centers on the STH-SOPR (Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio), a metric that measures whether coins moved by recent buyers are being sold at a profit or loss. A reading below 1.0 indicates that holders are realizing losses, a sign often interpreted as capitulation. While Bitcoin’s price has declined significantly, Dent points out that the STH-SOPR has not yet breached extreme levels seen in past correction events. Unlike major capitulation periods in 2024—such as those in May, July, and August—the current SOPR remains near its mean value, indicating that many short-term holders are not yet exiting their positions en masse. The absence of widespread capitulation raises questions about the potential for further downside. Dent warns that if selling pressure among short-term holders intensifies, the market could experience another wave of losses. Related Reading: Analyst Uncovers Clues—Is Bitcoin’s Historic Bull Cycle Finally Topping Out? For now, all eyes remain on the $78,000 support level, which may act as a key test for whether Bitcoin can stabilize or if deeper correction lies ahead. Yonsei Dent wrote: If STHs begin to exit more aggressively, the market could face further downside pressure. In the near term, close attention should be paid to whether the $78,000 support level can hold, as it may serve as a key line in the sand for the current market structure. Technical Outlook On Bitcoin Meanwhile, technical analysts’ outlook on BTC is slightly different. According to an analyst known as Merlijn The Trader on X, BTC is currently in what is termed the “green zone” where it is an ideal opportunity for accumulation. BITCOIN IS IN THE GREEN ZONE.

BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 Sparks April’s Crypto Buying Spree—Biggest Crypto Presale of 2025 About to End!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/212m-counting-blockdags-keynote-3-sparks-aprils-crypto-buying-spree-biggest-crypto-presale-of-2025-about-to-end/,"April marks a pivotal chapter for BlockDAG (BDAG) , as its recent Keynote 3 ignited one of the swiftest surges in the crypto scene this year. Within a mere 48 hours of its unveiling, BlockDAG amassed over $5 million, totaling $212 million and securing its spot at the forefront of the biggest crypto presale of 2025 to date. The keynote didn’t just outline future strategies—it revealed functioning infrastructure. The Beta Testnet V1, now handling over 1.2 million transactions, with 100+ nodes worldwide, demonstrates that BlockDAG is not just designing technology—it’s deploying it. This real-world application is what’s driving the current excitement. From Vision to Execution: How Keynote 3 Captured Attention CEO Antony Turner launched the keynote with a dynamic declaration: “Today’s presentation goes beyond gradual improvements; we’re setting a transformative agenda.” This paved the way for a robust demonstration that positioned BlockDAG well ahead of others. Unlike many initial-stage endeavors, BlockDAG’s ecosystem already boasts a public explorer, a token and NFT creator, an expanding suite of dApps, and active miner integration. With over 800,000 users on the X1 mining app and 16,800 ASIC miners in circulation, the ecosystem is not only thriving but also robustly supported by hardware. These accomplishments are not just notable achievements—they form the foundation of what is rapidly becoming the biggest crypto presale on the market. BlockDAG distinguishes itself in the presale space with its focus on scalability. During Keynote 3 , it was confirmed that over 10 centralized exchanges are poised to list BDAG post-mainnet. This step is crucial—CEX listings mean wider reach, heightened visibility, and the potential for substantial demand. And big players are taking notice. Following the keynote, there was a significant uptick in large-scale allocations, with multiple substantial buys suggesting growing interest from larger players. For those keen on backing infrastructurally sound L1 solutions, BlockDAG provides not just promise but tangible proof of progress. Hence, BlockDAG isn’t just making news—it’s leading the pack in the biggest crypto presale currently underway. Unpacking BlockDAG’s Impressive Growth Breaking Down the Facts: $212 million accumulated in just 10 months A striking $5 million collected within 48 hours following Keynote 3 More than 19.2 billion BDAG coins distributed Over 800,000 users of the X1 App 400,000+ TG Tap Miner enthusiasts A global shipment of 16,800+ miners These figures are not just for show. They demonstrate true market demand, widespread adoption, and strong community engagement. Together, they position BlockDAG as the biggest crypto presale by both funding and ecosystem involvement in 2025. Moreover, with the current Batch 27 price at $0.0248, early participants have realized a 2,380% ROI, with potential for further gains. The Rising Journey of BlockDAG BlockDAG”s secret advantage lies in its architecture. It merges DAG technology with Proof-of-Work, forming a hybrid that supports quick, scalable, and secure transactions. This system allows for simultaneous block confirmations, reducing bottlenecks and enhancing suitability for widespread use. BlockDAG”s technology stack is not only robust but also future-proof, with features like WASM and EVM compatibility, MEV resistance, and account abstraction. As the platform anticipates over 1,000+ dApps by 2026, demand for BDAG is set to surge. With tangible products, substantial hardware involvement, testnet developments, and confirmed CEX listings all before its official debut, BlockDAG is a frontrunner in the biggest crypto presale rankings. Keynote 3 emphasized that BlockDAG is not merely keeping pace—it”s setting the pace in the Layer 1 category before its market introduction. With record-breaking presale figures, escalating community activity, and operational technology, BDAG represents not just a smart choice—it’s a bold declaration. For those considering joining the wave of the biggest crypto presale , April may be the last chance before prices climb significantly.

However, BlockDAG has completely shifted the narrative. Post-Keynote 3, the project demonstrated real progress: a live testnet, delivered miners, and a functional app. While Bitcoin and Ethereum experience typical fluctuations, BlockDAG (BDAG) —with $212 million raised and a 2,380% ROI since its first batch—exemplifies effective execution even before its mainnet launch. Bitcoin (BTC): Retaining Leadership Despite a 12% Drop Bitcoin began 2025 robustly, priced at $94,443.52 on January 1. By April 1, 2025, it had decreased to about $83,201.67, a 12% reduction over the quarter. Despite this, Bitcoin continues to lead the crypto market with a market cap exceeding $1.63 trillion, holding its position as the largest cryptocurrency globally. The recent dip is partly due to global market uncertainties, including new U.S. tariffs affecting investor moods. Bitcoin remains a significant value holder, with sustained institutional interest. Analysts consider the recent dip a normal correction rather than a lasting downturn. Historically, Bitcoin has rebounded from similar declines. With mixed short-term sentiment, long-term holders remain steady. Despite economic challenges, Bitcoin’s enduring presence underscores its role as a crucial component of the crypto market. Experiencing a 45% Decline, Yet Whales Continue to Accumulate Ethereum saw a more severe correction than Bitcoin in the past three months. It started at $3,353.50 on January 1, 2025, but fell to about $1,827.88 by April 1, 2025, marking a 45% drop. Its market cap is currently around $220 billion, down from over $400 billion at the beginning of the year. This downturn is driven by regulatory challenges, profit-taking after ETF speculations, and wider economic shifts. Despite this, on-chain data shows significant ETH accumulation by large investors during this downturn, indicating strong confidence in Ethereum’s long-term prospects, particularly with upcoming network enhancements and Layer 2 growth. Although retail sentiment is cautious, the continued interest from major players suggests a possible recovery. Ethereum’s fundamentals remain robust, making it resilient amidst current market volatility. BlockDAG’s Real-World Impact Revealed at Keynote 3 For months, many labeled BlockDAG merely as another buzzworthy presale. But everything changed with the release of Keynote 3 . BlockDAG showed tangible results: physical miners dispatched, a functioning testnet up and running, a mobile application in use, and a significant $212 million gathered through the presale. Currently, with batch 27 priced at $0.0248, total coin sales have surpassed 19.1 billion. Those who joined early have witnessed a staggering 2,380% ROI from the first batch—a level of performance rarely seen, especially during a presale phase. More crucially, this isn’t merely about statistics; it’s about concrete delivery. The X30 and X100 ASIC miners are being received by users. Beta Testnet V1 is operational. The X1 Miner App is up and running and gaining traction among a community of mobile-first users. Doubters once asked if BlockDAG would progress beyond mere concept papers. Keynote 3 has robustly countered such doubts. This is no phantom product—it’s a robust framework, put into action even before the official mainnet release. It’s uncommon for a presale project to demonstrate such extensive development so early, and this is precisely why the excitement continues to build. With more than 140,000 holders now, BlockDAG is clearly establishing a comprehensive ecosystem, not merely marketing a dream. Real Results Trump Speculation in 2025 While Bitcoin is still the gold standard, and Ethereum constantly evolves through discussions on utility and updates, both have encountered challenges in the first quarter. Their journeys mirror those of established leaders—solid yet unsurprising. BlockDAG, in contrast, is crafting a unique narrative. After enduring months of skepticism, Keynote 3 brought substance to the table: operational products, live infrastructure, and undeniable forward motion. With over $212 million raised and an early 2,380% ROI, the project has transcended mere buzz. It’s not only vying for a spot at the table—it’s actively setting it. In a year where tangible outcomes are valued over mere conjecture, BlockDAG has offered a real benchmark to watch.

43057981,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147087,1744078219,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Tariff Claim: Trump’s Bold Stance on Decades-Overdue Trade Policy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-bold-tariff-trade-policy/,"In a move that has once again ignited global economic discussions, former U.S. President Donald Trump has taken to social media platform X to assert that tariffs should have been implemented ‘decades ago.’ This statement, echoing his long-held protectionist views, arrives amidst swirling rumors and clarifications regarding potential tariff waivers, adding another layer of complexity to the already intricate landscape of international trade. For those in the cryptocurrency world, these macroeconomic shifts are not just background noise; they represent significant factors that can influence market volatility and investment strategies. Let’s dive into what this all means and why it matters. Trump’s Tariff Declaration: A Blast from the Past? Donald Trump’s recent declaration on X isn’t exactly new territory. Throughout his presidency, tariffs were a cornerstone of his trade policy, often framed as a tool to protect American industries and jobs. His latest statement, ‘Tariffs should have been done decades ago,’ doubles down on this stance, suggesting a long-standing conviction about the necessity of import taxes. But what’s the rationale behind this enduring belief? Protecting Domestic Industries: Trump’s argument frequently centers on safeguarding American businesses from foreign competition. Tariffs, in theory, make imported goods more expensive, thereby making domestically produced goods more attractive to consumers. National Security: Another justification often cited is national security. Industries deemed critical to national defense, like steel and aluminum, have been targets of tariffs to ensure domestic production isn’t eroded by cheaper imports. Trade Deficits: Trump has consistently voiced concerns about trade deficits, viewing them as a sign of economic disadvantage. Tariffs are proposed as a way to reduce these deficits by discouraging imports. The Fake News Factor: Tariff Waivers and China Adding intrigue to the tariff narrative is the recent episode of ‘fake news’ concerning potential trade policy shifts. Reuters reported comments attributed to National Economic Council (NEC) Director Kevin Hassett, suggesting that Trump was considering a 90-day tariff waiver for all countries except China. This news briefly sparked hopes of eased trade tensions, particularly outside of the U.S.-China dynamic. However, this report was quickly debunked, highlighting the volatile information environment surrounding trade discussions. Why did this fake news spread, and what does it tell us? Market Sensitivity: Financial markets, including cryptocurrency markets, are highly sensitive to trade policy news. Any hint of easing tariffs can be interpreted positively, leading to market reactions. Information Warfare: In the current geopolitical climate, misinformation and disinformation are rampant. The spread of this fake news could be seen as a form of information warfare, testing market reactions or creating confusion. The Need for Reliable Sources: This incident underscores the critical importance of verifying information from trusted sources, especially in the fast-paced world of financial news and cryptocurrency updates. Decoding Global Economy Impact: Are Tariffs Really the Answer? The core question remains: are tariffs an effective tool for economic prosperity? Economists are sharply divided on this issue, and the real-world impact is complex and multifaceted. Let’s examine some key arguments: Argument For Tariffs Argument Against Tariffs Protection of Domestic Jobs: Tariffs can shield domestic industries from cheaper imports, potentially preserving jobs in those sectors. Increased Consumer Costs: Tariffs raise the price of imported goods, which can translate to higher prices for consumers, reducing purchasing power and potentially leading to inflation. National Security: Tariffs can ensure the viability of strategically important domestic industries, reducing reliance on foreign suppliers. Retaliation and Trade Wars: Tariffs often provoke retaliatory tariffs from other countries, escalating into trade wars that harm all involved economies. Bargaining Chip: Tariffs can be used as leverage in trade negotiations to pressure other countries to change their trade practices. Reduced Trade and Economic Growth: Tariffs can disrupt global supply chains, reduce international trade volumes, and hinder overall economic growth. For the cryptocurrency market, the ripple effects of global economy shifts due to tariffs are worth noting. Trade wars and economic uncertainty can lead to: Currency Fluctuations: Tariffs can impact exchange rates, potentially increasing volatility in fiat currencies and, by extension, influencing cryptocurrency valuations. Inflationary Pressures: As tariffs can contribute to inflation, cryptocurrencies are sometimes seen as a hedge against inflation, potentially increasing their appeal. Market Volatility: Uncertainty surrounding trade policy and economic stability can lead to increased volatility across all markets, including cryptocurrencies. Navigating the Trade Winds: Actionable Insights So, what can we glean from Trump’s renewed tariff rhetoric and the recent fake news episode? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed, Verify Sources: In the age of rapid information dissemination, especially on social media, it’s crucial to rely on credible news sources and verify information before making investment decisions. Monitor Global Economic News: Keep a close watch on developments in international trade and economic policy. These macro-level trends can significantly impact financial markets, including cryptocurrency. Diversify Your Portfolio: Economic uncertainty underscores the importance of portfolio diversification. Spreading investments across different asset classes can help mitigate risk. Understand the Broader Context: Trump’s tariff statements are part of a larger ongoing debate about globalization, protectionism, and the future of international trade. Understanding this broader context is essential for interpreting current events. The Lasting Impact of Tariff Policies Donald Trump’s continued advocacy for tariffs highlights a persistent tension in global economics – the balance between free trade and protectionism. While proponents argue for tariffs as a necessary tool to safeguard domestic industries and national interests, critics point to the potential for increased consumer costs, retaliatory trade wars, and overall economic disruption. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, understanding these dynamics is crucial. The interconnectedness of the global economy means that shifts in trade policy, even seemingly distant ones, can create waves that reach the digital asset markets. As the debate around economic impact of tariffs continues, vigilance and informed decision-making are more important than ever.

Monero, once the privacy king, is getting sidelined. Ondo, despite bold predictions, is running up against stiff technical barriers. And then there’s Qubetics, a quiet storm with over 506 million tokens already sold and a decentralized VPN utility that might just flip the script in 2025. Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just another token riding the wave. It’s solving real problems with real infrastructure — including one of the most in-demand features of our time: privacy-first, decentralized VPN technology. And with its current presale heating up fast, early participants are locking in gains while the price is still at $0.1573. In a sea of speculative promises, Qubetics is shaping up to be the top crypto coin to buy now for anyone who’s paying attention. Why Qubetics’ VPN Utility Is Winning Big in Web3 It’s no secret that VPNs are hot right now. But Web2 VPNs have limits: single points of failure, subscription models, and centralization risks. That’s where Qubetics changes the game. Its Decentralized VPN is powered through blockchain, giving users access to global private browsing, streaming, secure communication, and unrestricted internet — all without handing their data to a corporation. Picture this: a freelance journalist working from a restrictive country, a startup founder needing to collaborate with teams across the globe, or even a gamer looking for low-latency, geo-unlocked servers. Qubetics’ decentralized VPN puts the power back into their hands. The platform lets anyone deploy VPN nodes, earn rewards, and access private channels without borders — all while connecting seamlessly across multiple blockchains. And this isn’t just theory. Qubetics is the world’s first Web3 aggregator, uniting major blockchains under one hood. That interoperability gives its VPN app even more firepower, turning it into a core application in the growing Web3 ecosystem. It’s these utility-first innovations that are positioning Qubetics among the top crypto coins to buy now, especially for early adopters who value privacy, security, and cross-chain usability. Qubetics Presale: The Numbers, The ROI, and the Buzz The hype around the Qubetics presale isn’t just about buzz—it’s fueled by math. As of April 2025, Qubetics is in Stage 29 of its crypto presale , and $TICS is priced at $0.1573. Over 506 million tokens have already been sold, raising more than $15.9 million and drawing in a rapidly expanding community of over 24,400 token holders. The presale structure is tight: each stage lasts just seven days, and every Sunday, the price bumps up by 10%. That means missing even one week can cost latecomers big. Now let’s talk ROI. If someone were to purchase $TICS at the current $0.1573 price, and the token hits $1 post-presale, they’re looking at a 535.65% return. But if $TICS climbs to $5, the return spikes to a massive 3,078.26%. At $10? That’s 6,256.47% ROI. And at a hypothetical $15 price point after the mainnet launch? A jaw-dropping 9,434.71% ROI. That means a $1,000 entry at today’s price could yield $95,347.10—more than enough to change someone’s financial trajectory. Unlike other projects that promise sky-high returns with no utility, Qubetics is making waves because of what it’s solving—cross-border security, decentralized internet access, and multichain interoperability. It’s being featured in Best Altcoin to Buy now lists not because of hype, but because it’s doing what few others are: shipping product while the market watches. Ondo’s Hype Hits a Roadblock Ondo Finance came into 2024 swinging. With predictions of a potential 50x return, its name spread fast across speculative forums and breakout crypto circles. Analysts and YouTube personalities threw the project into spotlight territory, thanks to Ondo’s ambition to tokenize real-world assets and bring institutional finance to the blockchain. But according to recent coverage by The Crypto Updates, that bullish momentum has cooled. The price action is struggling to confirm a reversal from bearish patterns, and the charts show rejection at key resistance levels. Despite the hype around its future prospects, Ondo’s failure to break bullish structure has cast doubt over its immediate-term potential. In contrast, Qubetics’ consistent stage-by-stage progress, community growth, and real utility applications — like its decentralized VPN and aggregator framework — have given it a stronger technical and narrative edge, especially for those hunting the top crypto coins to buy now with tangible short- and long-term upside. Monero Fades After Binance Delisting Monero (XMR), once the poster child for privacy in crypto, is taking serious damage. Following its delisting from Binance in February, CoinDesk reports that darknet marketplaces are shifting back to Bitcoin. And for Monero, that’s a brutal signal. Losing traction among its most loyal user base — privacy-focused users — is the beginning of what many are calling a structural decline. Chainalysis has tracked this behavior closely. Their data shows darknet transactions now favoring BTC over XMR. Combine that with a lack of fresh adoption and institutional support, and it paints a bleak short-term picture. For a coin that once prided itself on being untraceable and untouchable, this shift in the market dynamic is more than just a headline. Meanwhile, Qubetics is actively building the future of privacy infrastructure — but without leaning solely on old-school privacy coin narratives. Its VPN use case, smart wallet integration, and cross-chain functionality mean it’s not only decentralized but highly scalable and user-friendly — everything Monero wishes it could still be. That contrast is helping Qubetics shine as one of the top crypto coins to buy now, especially for privacy-minded participants who also want real utility. Final Take: Which One Actually Deserves a Spot in Your Bag? With Monero struggling post-delisting, and Ondo failing to break out of resistance, Qubetics is emerging as the real standout in this trio. The $TICS token doesn’t just ride hype — it’s backed by functionality, cross-chain reach, and a presale structure that’s turning heads. Over $15.9 million raised, 506M tokens sold, and a mainnet launch locked for Q2 2025 — the numbers speak volumes. As a real-world VPN application, backed by strong tokenomics and robust ROI projections, Qubetics checks all the boxes for those eyeing the top crypto coins to buy now before the next surge. And with the presale stages flying by and weekly price hikes baked into the model, there’s little room left for hesitation. Those seeking to join this crypto presale now are getting early access to a platform that’s already redefining decentralized infrastructure.

Its real-world VPN use case, growing token sales, and aggressive presale structure give it standout utility and massive ROI potential in 2025. How much can you earn with a $100 Qubetics presale entry? If $TICS hits $15 after mainnet, a $100 buy-in today could turn into $10,488, based on current ROI projections.

This move, highlighted by Cointelegraph, comes roughly five months ahead of schedule and underscores the company’s strong financial position and confidence in its Bitcoin Treasury strategy. Let’s dive into what this means for Metaplanet, the broader crypto market, and the burgeoning trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption. Why is Metaplanet’s Early Bond Repayment a Big Deal for Bitcoin Treasury? Metaplanet’s decision to repay its bonds early isn’t just a routine financial transaction; it’s a powerful statement about the viability and potential benefits of a Bitcoin Treasury strategy. Here’s why this early repayment is noteworthy: Demonstrates Financial Strength: Early bond repayment signals robust cash flow and financial health. For a company that has publicly committed to holding Bitcoin, this action alleviates concerns about liquidity and financial stability often associated with volatile assets. Confidence in Bitcoin Strategy: By prioritizing bond repayment, even after allocating capital to Bitcoin, Metaplanet implicitly reaffirms its conviction in its Bitcoin Treasury approach. It suggests that their Bitcoin holdings have either performed well enough or their overall financial strategy is sound enough to allow for early debt reduction. Positive Signal for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: This move could encourage other companies considering or already implementing a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy . It showcases a real-world example of a company managing its finances effectively while incorporating Bitcoin into its treasury. Reduced Financial Risk: Paying off debt early reduces Metaplanet’s financial leverage and interest expenses, making the company less vulnerable to economic downturns and interest rate fluctuations. Metaplanet Bitcoin: A Bold Bet Paying Off? Metaplanet’s journey into the world of cryptocurrency began when it adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. This strategic pivot was driven by a desire to diversify its holdings and potentially benefit from Bitcoin’s appreciation. The company’s initial bond issuance of 2 billion yen was specifically intended to fuel further Metaplanet Bitcoin acquisitions. Now, just months later, repaying those bonds early raises some interesting questions: Has Bitcoin’s performance played a role? While the article doesn’t explicitly state this, Bitcoin’s price fluctuations could have influenced Metaplanet’s financial decisions. If Bitcoin holdings have appreciated significantly, it could have provided the company with increased financial flexibility. Is this a long-term strategy shift? The early repayment might indicate a shift in Metaplanet’s immediate financial priorities, perhaps focusing on debt reduction after a period of aggressive Bitcoin accumulation. However, their overall commitment to Bitcoin as a treasury asset appears to remain strong. What are the implications for shareholders? Early bond repayment is generally viewed positively by investors as it reduces risk and improves the company’s financial standing. For Metaplanet shareholders, this could translate to increased confidence in the company’s management and long-term prospects. Navigating the Challenges of Bond Repayment and Crypto Investment While early bond repayment is undoubtedly positive, it’s crucial to acknowledge the complexities and potential challenges involved in managing corporate finances alongside Crypto Investment , particularly in volatile markets. Here are some factors to consider: Challenge Considerations for Metaplanet & Others Market Volatility Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. Companies holding Bitcoin need robust risk management strategies to mitigate potential downsides. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Companies must stay informed and compliant with relevant regulations in their jurisdictions. Accounting and Tax Implications Accounting for and taxing cryptocurrency holdings can be complex and vary across jurisdictions. Clear guidelines and expert advice are essential. Security and Custody Safeguarding substantial Bitcoin holdings requires robust security measures and secure custody solutions to prevent theft or loss. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn from Metaplanet’s Bond Repayment? Metaplanet’s early Bond Repayment offers valuable insights for businesses and investors alike: Prudent Financial Management is Key: Even with innovative strategies like Bitcoin treasury adoption, sound financial management remains paramount. Metaplanet’s move underscores the importance of balancing growth initiatives with responsible debt management. Bitcoin as a Strategic Asset: This event reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin as a legitimate and potentially strategic corporate treasury asset. It demonstrates that companies can integrate Bitcoin into their financial strategies without compromising their financial stability. Transparency and Communication are Crucial: Metaplanet’s public disclosure of its Bitcoin strategy and bond repayment enhances transparency and builds trust with investors and the market. Adaptability is Essential: The dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market requires companies to be adaptable and responsive to changing market conditions and opportunities. Looking Ahead: The Future of Corporate Bitcoin Strategy Metaplanet’s proactive bond repayment could be a bellwether for the future of Corporate Bitcoin Strategy . As more companies explore integrating cryptocurrencies into their treasury management, examples like Metaplanet provide real-world data points and lessons learned. The coming years will likely see further evolution in how corporations approach Bitcoin, balancing potential rewards with inherent risks and navigating the evolving regulatory landscape. In conclusion, Metaplanet’s early bond repayment is more than just a financial maneuver; it’s a powerful signal of confidence in its Bitcoin strategy and a compelling case study for corporate crypto adoption. It highlights the potential for companies to leverage Bitcoin as part of a savvy and forward-thinking treasury approach, while maintaining financial prudence and stability.

On April 7, the regulator said its upcoming April 11 roundtable will discuss how it should handle crypto trading rules, calling it “Between a Block and a Hard Place: Tailoring Regulation for Crypto Trading.” It will be the second in a series of discussions on crypto, headed by its recently-formed Crypto Task Force . Taking part are Uniswap Labs chief legal officer Katherine Minarik, Cumberland DRW associate general counsel Chelsea Pizzola and Coinbase institutional product vice president Gregory Tusar — all firms that had once been in the regulator’s scope. Under the Biden administration, the regulator sued Cumberland DRW in October and Coinbase in June 2023 for alleged securities law violations, but both lawsuits were dropped this year under the Trump administration. The SEC also started an investigation for possible enforcement action into Uniswap Labs in April 2024, which was dropped in February with no further action. Also taking part in the roundtable are New York Stock Exchange product chief Jon Herrick, crypto brokerage FalconX business lead Austin Reid, securities tokenizing firm Texture Capital CEO Richard Johnson and the University of California, Berkeley finance chair Christine Parlour. Source: SEC Dave Lauer, co-founder of the advocacy group We the Investors and Tyler Gellasch, CEO of the not-for-profit Healthy Markets Association, will also take part, while law firm Goodwin Procter partner Nicholas Losurdo will moderate the discussion. Representing the SEC will be acting chair Mark Uyeda, Crypto Task Force chief of staff Richard Gabbert and Commissioners Caroline Crenshaw and Hester Peirce. The roundtable is the second crypto-focused discussion in a series of five that the SEC dubbed the “Spring Sprint Toward Crypto Clarity.” The first was on March 21, regarding the legal status of crypto, while three future discussions will cover custody, tokenization, and decentralized finance (DeFi). SEC’s Uyeda orders review of staff crypto comments The roundtables come as the SEC, under President Donald Trump, works to revamp its oversight of the crypto industry, with its latest action being to review staff statements on crypto so they can possibly be changed or withdrawn. Uyeda said in an April 5 statement shared by the SEC on X that due to Trump’s executive order on deregulation and recommendations from the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, he was reviewing seven staff statements, five of which concerned crypto. Source: SEC “The purpose of this review is to identify staff statements that should be modified or rescinded consistent with current agency priorities,” Uyeda said. Related: SEC paints ‘a distorted picture’ of USD stablecoin market — Crenshaw The first on the list was an April 2019 analysis from the Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology on how crypto sales could be investment contracts under the securities defining Howey test — an argument the agency had made to sue multiple crypto firms for legal violations. Also up for review are two Division of Investment Management statements, one from May 2021 asking investors to consider the risks of funds with exposure to Bitcoin futures and a November 2020 statement asking for feedback on whether state-chartered banks meet standards to be qualified custodians. The SEC will also look into a December 2022 Division of Corporation Finance statement that urged SEC-regulated companies to evaluate their disclosures to mention if a slew of crypto firm bankruptcies and collapses at the time impacted their business. Finally, the agency will review a Division of Examinations alert from February 2021 that said, “a number of activities related to the offer, sale and trading of digital assets that are securities present unique risks to investors.” Legal Panel: XRP win leaves Ripple a ‘bad actor’ with no crypto legal precedent set",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-08 02:30:02

The global economic stage is heating up again, and this time, it’s with a familiar face at the center of it all – former President Donald Trump. His recent pronouncements on trade with China are sending ripples across markets, and as always, the cryptocurrency world is watching closely. Are we on the verge of another major trade war? And how will this shocking tariff escalation impact your digital assets? Decoding Trump’s Tariff Threat: What’s the Deal? In a bold move that’s reminiscent of his previous administration’s trade policies, Donald Trump took to Truth Social to announce a potential doubling down on tariffs against China. Let’s break down the key points of this dramatic declaration: The 50% Tariff Ultimatum: Trump stated that if China proceeds with its newly announced 34% retaliatory tariff, the U.S. will respond with a massive 50% tariff on Chinese goods. This is not a minor tweak; it’s a significant escalation that could drastically alter trade dynamics between the world’s two largest economies. Reasoning Behind the Threat: Trump’s rationale echoes past grievances – concerns over China’s existing tariffs, unfair subsidies to its industries, and currency manipulation practices. These are long-standing issues that have been at the heart of trade tensions between the two nations. Ending Trade Talks: Perhaps the most assertive part of Trump’s statement is the declaration that all talks with China will be terminated. This suggests a complete breakdown in communication and a move away from negotiation as a tool to resolve trade disputes. Shifting Focus: Trump indicated that the U.S. will now pivot to trade negotiations with other countries. This implies a strategic realignment of trade partnerships, potentially leaving China isolated in terms of U.S. trade policy. This isn’t just about tariffs; it’s about a fundamental shift in the U.S.’s approach to international trade, particularly with China. But what does this all mean in practical terms? The Potential Ramifications of a China Trade War Escalation A 50% tariff is not just a number; it’s a seismic economic event waiting to happen. Let’s consider the potential fallout: Impact Area Potential Consequence Consumer Prices in the U.S. Significant increase in the cost of goods imported from China, potentially leading to higher inflation. Everything from electronics to clothing could become more expensive for American consumers. American Businesses Companies reliant on Chinese imports for production may face higher costs and supply chain disruptions. This could impact profitability and potentially lead to job losses in certain sectors. Chinese Economy A 50% tariff would severely impact Chinese exports to the U.S., potentially slowing down economic growth and affecting employment in export-oriented industries. Global Trade Escalating tariffs could trigger a broader trade war, impacting global supply chains and potentially leading to a slowdown in global economic growth. Other countries could get caught in the crossfire. Geopolitical Relations Increased trade tensions could further strain the already complex relationship between the U.S. and China, impacting diplomatic and geopolitical stability. For the cryptocurrency market, the implications are less direct but equally significant. Economic uncertainty and volatility often drive investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, perceived as hedges against traditional market turbulence. Trump ‘s Trade Tactics: Déjà Vu for the Markets? For those who followed market movements during Trump’s previous presidency, this news might feel like a rewind button has been pressed. His administration was characterized by aggressive trade negotiations and the frequent use of tariffs as a tool to achieve trade objectives. Remember the last time tariffs were a major talking point? Past Experiences: During Trump’s first term, the U.S. imposed tariffs on various Chinese goods, leading to retaliatory tariffs from China. This resulted in trade disputes, market volatility, and concerns about global economic stability. Market Reactions: Historically, announcements of new tariffs or escalations in trade tensions have often triggered negative reactions in stock markets. However, the crypto market’s response can be more nuanced, sometimes seeing inflows as investors seek safe havens. Uncertainty is the Key: The biggest market mover is often uncertainty. Trump’s unpredictable approach to trade policy injects a significant dose of uncertainty into the global economic outlook, which can be both a risk and an opportunity for different asset classes. Are we heading towards a repeat of past trade conflicts? Or is this a negotiating tactic designed to extract concessions from China? The answer remains unclear, but the potential for significant market disruption is certainly there. Navigating the Global Economy in the Age of Trade Wars In this volatile economic landscape, understanding the broader implications of trade policies is crucial, especially for those involved in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on developments related to U.S.-China trade relations. News about tariff implementations, trade talks (or lack thereof), and official statements from both sides can provide valuable signals. Diversify Your Portfolio: In times of economic uncertainty, diversification becomes even more important. Consider spreading your investments across different asset classes to mitigate risk. Monitor Market Sentiment: Pay attention to how traditional and crypto markets are reacting to trade news. Increased volatility in traditional markets can sometimes lead to increased interest in cryptocurrencies. Understand the Macroeconomic Picture: Trade wars are just one piece of the global economic puzzle. Factors like inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical events also play a significant role in shaping market conditions. Prepare for Volatility: Be prepared for potential market swings. Trade tensions can escalate quickly, leading to rapid shifts in market sentiment and asset prices. The threat of a 50% tariff is a serious development that could have far-reaching consequences. While the immediate impact on the cryptocurrency market might be indirect, the broader economic uncertainty and potential for market volatility are factors that crypto investors need to consider carefully. Conclusion: The Unfolding Trade Drama and Your Crypto Strategy Donald Trump’s latest tariff threat against China is a stark reminder of the interconnectedness of global economics and the potential for political decisions to send shockwaves through markets worldwide. Whether this is a negotiating tactic or a prelude to a full-blown trade war remains to be seen. However, the fear of escalation is real, and the implications for the global economy – and by extension, the cryptocurrency market – are significant. Staying informed, adapting your investment strategies, and preparing for potential volatility are crucial in navigating these uncertain times.

Recent technical analyses suggest that the DOGE price might be heading toward a major price correction. Will Dogecoin Price Dip from Long-standing Trendline? Dogecoin price has experienced a sharp decline as it broke below a long-standing ascending parallel channel. This channel had guided the price since 2018, and its breach marks a significant technical shift. According to Ali Charts, the loss of this key trendline support suggests bearish momentum. The breakdown also coincides with a rejection at the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level, located at approximately $0.16395. A technical analyst observed that the breakdown from this channel could lead to further declines. “The next major support level lies at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, which is around $0.06167,” the analyst noted. Amid this trend, a whale has transferred 300 million Dogecoin, valued at around $41.7 million, to the Binance exchange, adding to the uncertainty surrounding Dogecoin’s price. This level coincides with previous consolidation zones, making it an important point of focus for traders. However, if the price continues to move lower, a drop to $0.060 could be possible. The breakdown could signal a continued bearish trend if support levels fail to hold aligning with a recent DOGE price prediction . DOGE Price Bullish Divergence Shows Signs of Recovery Nevertheless, there is a sign of hope of bouncing back as this indicates that there was a break down recently. Dogecoin has hints of a bullish divergence on the daily chart, as per Crypto trader Trader Tardigrade. This pattern is evident when price goes lower while the Relative Strength Index (RSI), bounces and posts higher lows. This suggests that the selling momentum may be weakening, potentially indicating a price reversal. Dogecoin price is currently in the process of testing the $0.135 price level, which used to act as both support and resistance. The level had been holding firm throughout a consolidation stage in early 2023 and the breakdown may present a reversal pattern. According to the analysts, if the price of the Dogecoin will be able to sustain these supports, there is a possibility that DOGE price may recover and hit a $2 high. ‘$0.135 is significant because it has served as both support and resistance,’ said the analyst. If the price bounces from this level, we are likely to see a start of a new bulls trend. But if the support is not maintained, it is open for more downside movement. In such case, the price may drop lower and in extreme cases test $0.12 or even $0.10. Market Sentiment and Potential Bearish Continuation Despite the bullish divergence and potential for a recovery, the overall market sentiment remains cautious. The recent whale activity, alongside the price breakdown from the ascending channel, adds to the bearish outlook for Dogecoin. According an X post by to crypto analyst Kev Capital, market participants should watch for a reclaiming of the $0.18 level as a sign of a possible fakeout or short-term recovery. If Dogecoin is going to ‘flip’ this level and close above it, further resistance levels are set at $0.25 and $0.30. However, if the price fails to break through the key levels at $0.18 and $0.20, the memecoin may experience a slowdown in its recovery.

43059184,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147092,1744080616,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary AI Mandate: Shopify CEO Prioritizes AI Over Headcount Growth,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-shopify-headcount-revolution/,"In a revolutionary move signaling a major shift in tech employment strategy, Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke has declared a bold new policy. Before Shopify teams can even think about expanding their headcount, they must first demonstrate why Artificial Intelligence (AI) cannot handle the task. This isn’t just a suggestion; it’s a mandate, publicly announced by Lütke himself, sparking widespread conversation across the tech and business sectors. For those in the crypto world, always at the forefront of technological disruption, this news resonates deeply. Efficiency and lean operations are key in the volatile crypto market, and Shopify’s approach offers a glimpse into how AI could reshape teams everywhere, including potentially in the blockchain space. Why is Shopify Prioritizing AI Before Expanding Headcount? Lütke’s memo, shared openly on social media, is direct and unambiguous: teams need to prove that AI can’t do the job before requesting more human resources. He poses a thought-provoking question to his teams: “What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team?” This isn’t just about cost-cutting; it’s about fundamentally rethinking how work gets done at Shopify. The emphasis is on exploring the capabilities of AI agents to augment or even replace human tasks before simply adding more employees. This proactive stance highlights a crucial shift in corporate strategy, where efficiency driven by AI becomes a primary consideration for growth. Here’s a breakdown of the key points from Lütke’s announcement: AI-First Approach: Before seeking additional headcount , teams must explore and justify why AI cannot fulfill the required functions. Focus on Autonomous AI Agents: Lütke encourages teams to envision a future where autonomous AI agents are integral team members, prompting innovative project ideas and discussions. Efficiency and Innovation: The goal is to drive greater efficiency and potentially unlock new innovative solutions by leveraging AI capabilities. Public Transparency: By sharing the memo publicly, Lütke invites open discussion and sets a precedent for other companies to consider similar strategies. The Looming Question of Job Disruption and AI While Shopify’s move towards AI-first operations might seem innovative, it inevitably fuels the ongoing debate about job disruption due to AI. The fear that AI will replace human workers is not new, but it’s becoming increasingly tangible. A recent United Nations report further amplifies these concerns, estimating that AI could potentially disrupt over 40% of jobs globally. This is a significant figure, and it underscores the potential societal impact of widespread AI adoption in the workplace. For many, the excitement around AI innovation is tempered by anxieties about employment security. However, it’s crucial to consider a balanced perspective. While job disruption is a valid concern, AI also presents opportunities for job transformation and the creation of new roles that we can’t even imagine yet. The focus might shift from routine tasks to more strategic, creative, and human-centric roles, requiring upskilling and adaptation in the workforce. Klarna’s Example: AI-Driven Efficiency in Customer Service Shopify isn’t alone in exploring AI for enhanced efficiency . Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO of Klarna, a prominent fintech company, provides a compelling real-world example. Klarna’s AI chatbot is reportedly handling the workload equivalent to 700 customer service agents. This is not just incremental improvement; it’s a massive leap in operational efficiency . Siemiatkowski even suggests that AI could potentially reduce Klarna’s total workforce to just 2,000 employees, down from its current 4,000. This dramatic example illustrates the transformative power of AI in streamlining operations and potentially reshaping workforce sizes. Let’s compare Shopify and Klarna’s employee numbers to understand the context: Company Employees (Current) Potential Future Workforce (AI-Driven) Shopify (2024) ~8,100 Potentially smaller workforce in the future (unspecified) Klarna (Current) ~4,000 ~2,000 (Projected by CEO) It’s worth noting that Shopify had already undertaken significant layoffs in the past, reducing its staff by 20% the previous year and reportedly conducting further quiet layoffs in customer service in early 2024. This context suggests that the push for AI adoption might be part of a broader strategy to optimize resources and streamline operations in a competitive tech landscape. Navigating the Future of Headcount and AI: Challenges and Opportunities Shopify’s AI-first headcount policy presents both challenges and opportunities for businesses and employees alike. Challenges: Employee Morale and Anxiety: Announcements like these can understandably create anxiety among employees regarding job security and future career prospects. Implementation Complexity: Integrating AI effectively and ethically into existing workflows requires careful planning, investment, and potentially significant organizational change. Ethical Considerations: As AI takes on more responsibilities, ethical considerations around bias, transparency, and accountability become increasingly important. Skill Gaps: The workforce may need to adapt and acquire new skills to work effectively alongside AI systems and focus on tasks that AI cannot yet handle. Opportunities: Increased Efficiency and Productivity: AI can automate repetitive tasks, freeing up human employees to focus on higher-value activities, strategic thinking, and innovation. New Job Roles: The rise of AI will likely create new job roles in areas such as AI development, maintenance, ethics, and AI-human collaboration. Enhanced Customer Experiences: AI can power personalized and efficient customer service, leading to improved customer satisfaction. Business Growth and Innovation: By leveraging AI, companies can unlock new levels of efficiency , innovate faster, and potentially achieve greater business growth. Actionable Insights: Preparing for an AI-Driven Future For businesses and individuals navigating this evolving landscape, here are some actionable insights: Embrace AI Learning: Invest in understanding AI capabilities and limitations. Explore how AI can be integrated into your workflows or skillsets. Focus on Human-Centric Skills: Develop skills that complement AI, such as critical thinking, creativity, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving. Strategic Workforce Planning: Businesses should proactively plan for workforce evolution, considering how AI can augment human capabilities and where new roles might emerge. Open Communication and Transparency: Companies should communicate openly with employees about AI strategies and address concerns about job disruption transparently. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards an AI-Augmented Workforce Shopify’s mandate to consider AI before headcount growth is a significant signal. It reflects a growing trend in the tech industry and beyond – a move towards leveraging AI to enhance efficiency and potentially reshape the future of work. While concerns about job disruption are valid and need to be addressed thoughtfully, the potential for AI to drive innovation, create new opportunities, and augment human capabilities is undeniable. The coming years will be crucial in determining how effectively businesses and individuals adapt to this AI-driven transformation. Shopify’s bold move is not just about their company; it’s a bellwether for the broader evolution of work in the age of AI.

43059531,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147091,1744081246,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Validated Security: KuCoin Achieves SOC 2 Type II Certification, Setting New Crypto Exchange Standards",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/kucoin-soc2-security-compliance/,"In the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrency, security and trust are paramount. For users entrusting their digital assets to exchanges, knowing that these platforms adhere to the highest security standards is not just reassuring—it’s essential. KuCoin, a leading global crypto exchange, has taken a significant leap in reinforcing user trust by achieving the coveted SOC 2 Type II certification. This milestone isn’t just another badge; it’s a testament to KuCoin’s unwavering commitment to creating a secure and compliant environment for its users. But what exactly does this certification mean for you, and why should it matter in your crypto journey? What Does KuCoin’s SOC 2 Type II Certification Mean for Crypto Users? The SOC 2 Type II certification is a rigorous audit conducted by independent third-party firms to evaluate an organization’s systems and controls. It focuses on five key ‘Trust Services Criteria’: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. Achieving SOC 2 compliance , especially the Type II designation, is no small feat. It signifies that over a sustained period, in KuCoin’s case, a year-long audit by Decrypt Compliance, the exchange has not only designed but also effectively operated controls to safeguard user data and assets. Here’s a breakdown of what this certification practically means for KuCoin users: Enhanced Security Posture: The certification validates that KuCoin has implemented robust security measures to protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats. This includes everything from network security and access controls to incident response and data encryption. Improved Data Privacy: SOC 2 Type II emphasizes the protection of sensitive information. For KuCoin users, this means greater assurance that their personal and financial data is handled with the utmost care and in accordance with privacy best practices. Increased System Availability: Availability is another critical aspect of SOC 2. The certification confirms KuCoin’s commitment to maintaining system uptime and ensuring users can access the platform and their funds reliably. This is vital in the 24/7 crypto market. Operational Excellence and Trust: The rigorous audit process reflects KuCoin’s dedication to operational excellence. By undergoing and successfully completing a SOC 2 Type II audit, KuCoin demonstrates transparency and a commitment to building trust with its user base. In essence, KuCoin SOC 2 Type II certification acts as an independent seal of approval, assuring users that the exchange operates under stringent security and compliance frameworks. It’s a powerful signal in an industry where security concerns are often at the forefront of users’ minds. Why is Crypto Exchange Security and Compliance More Important Than Ever? The cryptocurrency landscape, while brimming with innovation and opportunity, is also a target for cyber threats. The decentralized and often pseudonymous nature of crypto transactions, combined with the high value of digital assets, makes exchanges prime targets for hackers and malicious actors. News headlines are unfortunately filled with stories of exchange hacks and security breaches, underscoring the critical need for robust crypto exchange security measures. Here’s why security and compliance are non-negotiable in the crypto world: Protecting User Assets: The primary responsibility of any crypto exchange is to safeguard user funds. Robust security protocols are essential to prevent theft, loss of funds, and ensure the integrity of user accounts. Maintaining Market Integrity: Security breaches and lack of compliance can erode trust in the entire crypto market. Exchanges that prioritize security contribute to a more stable and trustworthy ecosystem. Regulatory Scrutiny: As the crypto industry matures, regulatory bodies worldwide are increasingly focusing on compliance. Exchanges that proactively adhere to security and compliance standards are better positioned to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape and avoid potential penalties. Building User Confidence: In a nascent and sometimes volatile market, user confidence is crucial for adoption and growth. Certifications like SOC 2 Type II play a vital role in building this confidence by demonstrating a commitment to best practices. KuCoin’s achievement of exchange security standards through SOC 2 Type II certification is a proactive step towards addressing these critical concerns. It signals a commitment to going above and beyond basic security measures to meet internationally recognized benchmarks. Navigating Digital Asset Security: What Can Users Learn from KuCoin’s Example? KuCoin’s journey to SOC 2 Type II certification offers valuable lessons for both crypto exchanges and individual users navigating the complexities of digital asset security . For Crypto Exchanges: Prioritize Security from Day One: Security should not be an afterthought but a foundational element of exchange design and operations. Embrace Independent Audits: Seeking independent certifications like SOC 2 Type II demonstrates a commitment to transparency and accountability. Continuous Improvement: Security is an ongoing process, not a destination. Regular audits, security updates, and proactive threat monitoring are essential. Communicate Transparently: Inform users about security measures and certifications to build trust and confidence. For Crypto Users: Choose Secure Platforms: When selecting a crypto exchange, prioritize those with strong security track records and certifications like SOC 2 Type II. Practice Good Security Hygiene: Beyond exchange security, users must also adopt good security practices, such as strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and vigilance against phishing scams. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of security news and best practices in the crypto space. Diversify Risk: Consider not keeping all your crypto assets on a single exchange. Explore hardware wallets and other secure storage options for long-term holdings. Looking Ahead: The Future of Security and Compliance in Crypto As the crypto industry matures, the bar for security and compliance will only continue to rise. Certifications like SOC 2 Type II are becoming increasingly important benchmarks for exchanges seeking to demonstrate their commitment to user protection and regulatory adherence. We can expect to see: Increased Adoption of Security Standards: More exchanges will likely pursue SOC 2 and similar certifications to enhance their credibility and attract institutional investors and risk-averse users. Stricter Regulatory Oversight: Regulators worldwide will continue to tighten compliance requirements for crypto exchanges, focusing heavily on security and anti-money laundering (AML) measures.

Recently, a significant event caught the attention of on-chain analysts and crypto enthusiasts alike: an anonymous whale made a substantial crypto investment , scooping up a massive amount of Ethereum (ETH). Let’s delve into the details of this intriguing purchase and explore what it might signify for the broader crypto landscape. Decoding the Enigmatic Ethereum Whale Purchase According to the astute observations of pseudonymous on-chain analyst The Data Nerd on X (formerly Twitter), a mysterious entity, identified as a ‘whale’ due to the sheer size of their holdings and transactions, acquired a staggering 13,075 ETH in March. At the time of purchase, this ETH purchase was valued at an impressive $23.27 million. This large-scale acquisition by an anonymous player immediately sparks curiosity and raises several key questions: Who is this whale? The anonymity surrounding the purchaser adds an element of intrigue. Is it an institutional investor, a high-net-worth individual, or perhaps a fund making a strategic move? Why Ethereum? Out of the myriad of cryptocurrencies available, why did this whale choose to invest such a significant sum in Ethereum? What specific aspects of Ethereum attracted this level of investment? What are the market implications? Does such a large purchase signal bullish sentiment towards Ethereum? How does this crypto investment impact the overall market dynamics and future price predictions? To understand the significance, let’s break down the key aspects: Aspect Details Cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) Amount Purchased 13,075 ETH Value of Purchase $23.27 Million (in March) Purchaser Anonymous Whale Source of Information The Data Nerd (on-chain analyst) Why Ethereum? Unpacking the Whale’s Crypto Investment Strategy Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is more than just a digital currency. It’s a decentralized platform that hosts a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols. Several factors might have influenced the whale’s decision to make such a substantial crypto investment in Ethereum: Dominance in dApps and DeFi: Ethereum remains the leading platform for decentralized applications and decentralized finance. The growth and innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem present significant investment opportunities. The Merge and Technological Advancements: Ethereum’s successful transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, known as ‘The Merge’, significantly improved its energy efficiency and laid the groundwork for future scalability upgrades. This upgrade could be seen as a strong bullish signal for long-term investors. Institutional Interest: Increasingly, institutional investors are recognizing the potential of Ethereum and its ecosystem. Large purchases like this might indicate growing institutional accumulation. Potential for Price Appreciation: Whales often invest with a long-term perspective, anticipating future price appreciation. The current market conditions might have presented an opportune moment to accumulate ETH at a potentially favorable price. Analyzing the Market Impact of the Massive ETH Purchase A purchase of this magnitude naturally has implications for the market analysis of Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market. Here’s a look at potential impacts: Price Volatility and Momentum: Large whale transactions can contribute to short-term price volatility. However, they often signal strong buying pressure, which can lead to positive price momentum in the medium to long term. Market Sentiment: Such a significant ETH purchase can boost market sentiment. It suggests that a large player has confidence in Ethereum’s future prospects, which can encourage other investors to follow suit. Reduced Supply on Exchanges: When whales move large amounts of ETH off exchanges into private wallets, it reduces the available supply on exchanges. This scarcity can potentially drive up prices if demand remains constant or increases. On-Chain Metrics and Signals: Analyzing on-chain data, like whale transactions, provides valuable insights into market trends that are not always apparent from traditional market analysis . Tools that track whale movements can offer early signals of potential market shifts. Navigating Crypto Investments: Lessons from Whale Activity While mimicking whale trades blindly is not advisable, understanding their activity can offer valuable lessons for navigating the volatile crypto market and making informed crypto investment decisions: Due Diligence is Paramount: Whales likely conduct extensive research before making such large investments. Retail investors should also prioritize thorough research and due diligence before investing in any cryptocurrency. Long-Term Perspective: Whale investments often reflect a long-term outlook. Adopting a similar long-term perspective, rather than focusing on short-term price fluctuations, can be beneficial. Diversification: While this whale made a large bet on Ethereum, diversification remains a crucial risk management strategy. Spreading investments across different assets can mitigate potential losses. Stay Informed with On-Chain Data: Monitoring on-chain data and whale activity can provide valuable insights into market trends and potential opportunities. Tools and analysts like The Data Nerd play a crucial role in deciphering these signals. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of Crypto Market Dynamics The anonymous whale’s $23.27 million ETH purchase serves as a compelling reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the identity and specific motivations of this whale remain shrouded in mystery, their significant crypto investment underscores the enduring appeal and potential of Ethereum. By staying informed, conducting thorough research, and understanding the signals within market analysis and on-chain data, investors can better navigate the crypto landscape and potentially capitalize on emerging opportunities. The actions of whales, while not definitive guides, offer intriguing glimpses into the strategies and sentiments of major players in this exciting and evolving financial frontier.

Google is bringing this vision closer to reality with its latest Google AI Mode update. This groundbreaking feature now allows users to ask complex questions about images, opening up a new dimension of visual search capabilities. Think of it as having a super-smart AI assistant that can not only see what you see but also understand it deeply and answer your intricate questions based on visual data. Unlocking Visual Insights with Google AI Mode Google AI Mode , Google’s experimental search feature designed for complex and multi-layered queries, has just leveled up. Users with access to this innovative mode can now leverage its power to analyze images. This means you can upload photos or use your camera directly within Google Search and pose questions about them. This isn’t just simple image recognition; it’s a sophisticated understanding of visual content that goes beyond identifying objects. Powered by the robust multimodal capabilities of Google Lens, this new feature enables AI Image Search to comprehend entire scenes within an image. According to Google’s official announcement, Google AI Mode can discern the relationships between objects, understand their materials, colors, shapes, and spatial arrangement. This comprehensive understanding allows for a far more nuanced and informative search experience compared to traditional keyword-based queries. How Does AI-Powered Image Questioning Work? The magic behind this enhanced visual search lies in a technique Google calls “query fan-out.” Instead of just answering your direct question, Google AI Mode proactively asks multiple related questions about both the image as a whole and the individual elements within it. This proactive approach allows the AI to gather a more comprehensive understanding and provide richer, more detailed information than a standard search. Let’s break down the process: Image Upload or Capture: You begin by uploading an image or taking a photo directly within the Google AI Mode interface. Query Input: You then type in your complex question related to the image. AI Analysis: Google AI Mode , powered by Google Lens, analyzes the image, understanding objects, context, and relationships. Query Fan-Out: The AI generates and asks multiple internal questions to explore different facets of the image and your query. Detailed Response: Finally, Google AI Mode provides a detailed answer based on its comprehensive analysis, often going beyond a simple keyword match. Practical Examples of AI Image Analysis in Action Imagine you’re a book enthusiast. You can now simply snap a photo of your bookshelf and ask Google AI Mode : “If I enjoyed these, what are some similar books that are highly rated?” Here’s what happens: Book Identification: Google AI Mode instantly identifies each book on your shelf. Similarity Analysis: It then analyzes the themes, genres, and authors of these books. Recommendation Engine: Based on this analysis, it generates a list of highly-rated, similar books. Actionable Links: The recommendations come with direct links, allowing you to easily learn more about each book or even purchase them online. But the interaction doesn’t stop there. Google AI Mode allows for follow-up questions, enabling you to refine your search further. For example, you could ask: “I’m looking for a quick read, which one of these recommendations is the shortest?” The AI will then filter the recommendations based on your new criteria, showcasing its ability to understand context and engage in a conversational search experience. Expanding Access and Taking on Competitors Google is making Google AI Mode more widely accessible, rolling it out to millions more users enrolled in Google Labs, their platform for experimental features. Previously, this powerful tool was limited to Google One AI Premium subscribers. This broader release signals Google’s commitment to making advanced AI Image Search technology available to a wider audience. This move also positions Google AI Mode as a direct competitor to emerging services like Perplexity and OpenAI’s ChatGPT Search, which are also pushing the boundaries of AI-powered search. As the landscape of information retrieval evolves, Google AI Mode is poised to be a significant player, offering a unique blend of visual and textual understanding. The Future of Visual Search is Here Google has stated that they are committed to continuous refinement of the user experience and further expansion of Google AI Mode functionality. This suggests that we can expect even more innovative features and improvements in the near future, making visual search an increasingly integral part of how we interact with information online. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, the implications of such advanced Image Analysis and Multimodal Search are vast. Imagine quickly analyzing complex charts, infographics, or even screenshots of market trends simply by asking Google AI Mode targeted questions. The ability to extract insights from visual data with such ease can be a game-changer for research, analysis, and staying ahead in the fast-paced world of crypto. Revolutionary Google AI Mode is not just an incremental update; it’s a leap forward in how we interact with visual information. By blending the power of AI Image Search with conversational querying, Google is unlocking a new era of intuitive and insightful search experiences.

Many of these companies were set up purporting to provide “genuine services” but were instead believed to be scamming their victims, ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said in an April 8 statement. “There appears to be a common pattern of scam activity in the nature of ‘pig butchering,’” Justice Angus Stewart said in an April 4 court ruling after looking at 48 “Reviews of Misconduct” from 17 companies accused of facilitating romance scams. The judgment was made on March 21. Source: Rocky Perrotta Pig butchering scams involve scammers building fake relationships with victims to win their trust before convincing them to invest in a fraudulent crypto or financial scheme. The securities regulator also suspects that much of the scam activity is coming from Southeast Asia. Insolvency and restructuring advisers Catherine Conneely and Thomas Birch of Cor Cordis have been appointed as joint liquidators of the 95 companies. Related: Australian regulator’s ‘blitz’ hits crypto exchanges, money remitters Nearly 1,500 claims by “investors” had been received by the provisional liquidators, amounting to total claims of over $35.8 million, according to the court order. The claimants are based in 14 countries, including Australia, the US, Cameroon, Ghana, India, Nepal, the Philippines and France. The provisional liquidators found that only three of the 95 firms had assets to their name and recommended that the other 92 companies be wound up and immediately deregistered. ASIC shutting down scam websites ASIC said it has been removing around 130 scam websites each week of late, bringing its total to over 10,000 sites, which have included over 7,200 fake investment platform scams and 1,564 phishing scams. “However, these scams are like hydras: you shut down one and two more take its place. That's why we're warning consumers that the threat of scams and identity fraud remains high. We remind consumers to be vigilant,” Court said. Australia’s National Anti-Scam Centre recently reported a 26% fall in scam losses to $2 billion in 2024, while the number of scam reports also fell by 17.8% to 494,732.

However, total assets under management remained steady at $132.6 billion, reflecting a slight 0.8% increase. CoinShares stated that this stability is impressive when compared to other asset classes, such as MSCI World equities, which dropped 8.5% during the same period, highlighting the strength of digital assets in the face of economic uncertainty. According to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report , the bulk of the outflows came from Bitcoin as $207 million left the market over the past week, which reduced its total year-to-date inflows to $1.3 billion. Short-Bitcoin saw $2.8 million in inflows during the same period. Altcoin flows were quite varied, as Ethereum experienced withdrawals worth $37.7 million, and Solana and Sui saw outflows of $1.8 million and $4.7 million, respectively. On the other hand, XRP saw positive movement with $4.5 million in inflows, followed by multi-asset products with $1.4 million. Toncoin, a more “esoteric” token, also saw a gain of $1.1 million in inflows. For the second consecutive week, blockchain equities saw $8 million in inflows, with investors perceiving the recent price weakness as a chance to purchase. Regional outflows were significant, with the US and Germany leading the way with $210 million and $17.7 million in outflows, respectively. Switzerland and Sweden followed with $8.3 million and $7.1 million. Contrastingly, Canadian investors saw the market volatility as an opportunity to increase their positions, which resulted in inflows of $4.8 million. Brazil and Hong Kong saw more modest inflows of $1.4 million and $0.8 million, with Australia attracting $0.6 million.

In response, the meme stock price initially jumped only to succumb to the uncertainty plaguing the stock market as President Donald Trump announced heavy tariffs . The concerns over a global trade war have ignited a fresh wave of volatility in the market. Vibes and sentiments in the crypto market have already been severely negative and firmly in the ‘ fear ’ category ever since President Trump’s inauguration as the 47th President of the US on Jan. 20. That day, Bitcoin hit an all-time high (ATH) of $109,000 only to lose 23.1% of its value since then. This drawdown ended up obliterating altcoins and meme coins that have the total crypto market cap now sitting under $2.8 trillion, as per CoinGecko . However, things may finally change when GME actually begins the purchase and adds BTC to the company’s balance sheet. Substantial buying pressure like this has the potential to change market sentiments completely and bring in a much-needed fresh wave of bullish momentum. GameStop’s Bitcoin Investment Plans Speculations that GME will buy Bitcoin first started when GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen met up with Michael Saylor, the executive chair of the biggest public company by BTC holdings. Cohen actually posted a photo of himself with Saylor on X, which got the crypto community talking. CNBC also reported that GameStop is exploring investing in alternative asset classes, Bitcoin in particular, citing three unnamed sources. Just the consideration of the investment sent GME’s stock price soaring. A couple of weeks after that, Strive CEO Matt Cole sent a letter to Cohen and encouraged GME to adopt BTC as a reserve asset. “We believe GameStop has an incredible opportunity to transform its financial future by becoming the premier bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector,” read the letter. Now, finally, a week ago, GameStop announced that the board has unanimously approved a plan to buy Bitcoin with its corporate cash. The company currently holds about $4.8 billion in cash. According to the video game retailer, a portion of its cash or future debt and equity issuances may be invested in BTC as well as U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins. GameStop also said that it has not set a limit on the amount of crypto it would purchase. This week, GameStop raised $1.5 billion via a convertible note offering and has already earmarked the funds to acquire Bitcoin. In a filing with the SEC, the video game retailer said it plans to use the net proceeds from the offering for “general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin.” The Decentralized GME Revolution The crypto industry is excited about this upcoming purchase and its impact on the broad crypto market. The GME Ethereum community is also thrilled about what’s ahead and conducted a space on X, discussing the potential of such a big move from GME. https://t.co/wJDLd5Zri8 — GME Ethereum (@GMEethereum) April 3, 2025 GME Ethereum is a digital representation of the GameStop saga that saw the value of this stock skyrocketing as retail came together to fight institutions and hedge funds. Built on the secure Ethereum blockchain, GME Ethereum operates in a completely decentralized ecosystem. There’s no centralized party in control here as developers have renounced their ownership, giving the community full control over the project. Amidst the growing GME movement, GME Ethereum recently reached a milestone of 10,000 holders. Given the meme coin, GME Ethereum’s connection with the meme stock GME, crypto accumulation from the video retailer has the potential to send its prices higher.

However, at the time of writing, the asset is seeing a quiet rebound with prices now hovering back above $79,000. Regardless of this slight uptick, the asset is still down by 3.1% in the past day and nearly 30% from its peak above $109,000 registered in January. According to CryptoQuant contributor IT Tech, a significant shift may be underway. Related Reading: Understanding Bitcoin Struggles: Why Realized Cap Indicates A Bear Market Old Coins Starts To Move: Sell Off ahead? In a recent analysis titled “Massive spike in Exchange Inflow CDD signals old coins are waking up,” IT Tech noted a considerable surge in the Exchange Inflow Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric. CDD measures the movement of older coins—those that have not changed hands for a long time. When coins with high coin days are moved, it often indicates that long-term holders are transferring their assets to exchanges, potentially with the intent to sell. Historically, spikes in Exchange Inflow CDD have preceded large price corrections. IT Tech highlighted that the latest surge in this metric coincided with Bitcoin’s drop from $82,000 to $76,000, suggesting that some veteran holders may be preparing to liquidate their positions. Such behavior tends to exert additional sell pressure on the market, particularly during already volatile conditions. These movements could indicate an inflection point, with older investors potentially looking to secure profits amid broader market uncertainty. If this trend continues, it could serve as a bearish signal, as coins dormant for months or years re-enter circulation. Bitcoin Short-Term Metrics Indicate Possible Cooling Trend Meanwhile, in a separate analysis, another CryptoQuant analyst BilalHuseynov offered insights into short-term holder behavior through the lens of realized price data. In a post titled “Bitcoin: Realized Price – UTXO Age Bands,” the analyst examined how the realized prices for coins held by short-term investors—specifically those held for one week to one month and one to three months—can reveal the health of the ongoing market trend. These UTXO age bands help determine whether recent buyers are holding in profit or loss. In bullish phases, these bands trend upwards, signaling accumulation. However, at market tops, the lines tend to flatten or decline, indicating distribution by short-term participants. According to Huseynov, this is what the current data reflects. The 1-month to 3-month realized price is curving downward, echoing patterns seen at previous peaks in April and November 2021, and more recently in March 2025.

Buckle up, because Waymo, a leader in autonomous vehicle technology, is reportedly planning to leverage data from its robotaxis’ interior cameras for exactly that. This groundbreaking move, initially spotted in an unreleased privacy policy, is raising significant eyebrows in the tech and privacy spheres, especially for those concerned about data usage in the age of ever-evolving artificial intelligence. Waymo AI and Generative AI: A Data-Driven Future? According to tech researcher Jane Manchun Wong, Waymo is exploring the use of “interior camera data associated with rider’s identity” to train its generative AI models. This isn’t just about improving navigation or vehicle performance; it’s about potentially understanding rider behavior within the autonomous vehicle to an unprecedented degree. Imagine AI models trained on your reactions, expressions, and movements inside a robotaxi. This data goldmine could fuel a new wave of AI innovation, but at what cost to personal privacy? Waymo is working on Generative AI training using “interior camera data associated with rider’s identity,” provides opt-opts for this and data sharing under CCPA Waymo explicitly states in this unreleased Privacy page it may share your data for personalized ads pic.twitter.com/y4y9f6WwI1 — Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) April 5, 2025 Robotaxi Data Privacy: Are Your Rides Private? The revelation brings robotaxi data privacy into sharp focus. While Waymo assures riders of opt-out options for data sharing and AI training, the very idea of interior camera data being used for these purposes is unsettling for many. The unreleased privacy policy states Waymo might share data to: Improve and analyze its functionality. Tailor products, services, ads, and offers to your interests. While the first point is understandable for service improvement, the second raises immediate red flags about personalized advertising. It’s one thing to see targeted ads online, but the prospect of in-vehicle ads tailored to your robotaxi behavior feels distinctly more intrusive. Autonomous Vehicles and the Ad Revenue Stream: A New Frontier? Waymo explicitly states it “may share your data for personalized ads.” This hints at a potential new revenue stream for autonomous vehicles beyond ride fares. As Waymo expands its robotaxi services across cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Austin, the volume of ride data, including interior camera footage, is set to explode. With over 200,000 paid weekly rides, the data collection potential is immense. Waymo’s Robotaxi Growth (Weekly Rides): Period Weekly Rides Two Years Ago 10,000 As of February 2025 200,000+ This growth trajectory, coupled with expansion plans into Atlanta, Miami, and Washington D.C., underscores the increasing significance of data generated by its fleet. But is monetizing this data through targeted ads the right path, or does it cross a crucial privacy line? Data Sharing Concerns: Who Has Access to Your Robotaxi Data? The ambiguity surrounding data sharing is another key concern. It’s unclear what specific interior data will be used for AI training. Facial expressions? Body language? And crucially, is Waymo sharing this sensitive data with other Alphabet entities like Google or DeepMind, which are heavily invested in AI development? The privacy policy mentions opting out of sharing with “third parties,” but the definition of “third parties” in Alphabet’s vast ecosystem could be interpreted narrowly. The lack of transparency regarding data usage and sharing raises valid questions about control and consent. Navigating the Ethical Crossroads of AI and Privacy Waymo’s move highlights the complex ethical landscape of AI development, especially in the context of personal data. While the company offers opt-out options, the onus is on the user to be aware and actively manage their privacy settings. Many may be unaware of the depth of data collection or the implications of opting in or out. As autonomous vehicles become more integrated into our daily lives, striking a balance between innovation, revenue generation, and user privacy is paramount. The industry needs to proactively address these concerns to build trust and ensure a future where technological advancements don’t come at the cost of fundamental privacy rights. Bitcoin World has reached out to Waymo for further clarification on these points and will update this article as more information becomes available.

The always-vigilant Whale Alert has just flagged a colossal movement in the Bitcoin seas. A staggering 3,000 BTC , worth approximately $235 million at current valuations, has been transferred from the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex to Kraken . This significant Bitcoin whale transfer has the crypto community buzzing. But what does this mean? Let’s dive into the details of this intriguing transaction and explore its potential implications for the crypto market. Decoding the Bitcoin Whale Transfer: What Just Happened? When we talk about a Bitcoin whale transfer , we’re referring to the movement of a substantial amount of Bitcoin. In the crypto world, ‘whales’ are entities or individuals holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency. Their transactions can sometimes signal shifts in market sentiment or even precede significant price movements. A Bitcoin whale transfer of 3,000 BTC is definitely noteworthy, considering the sheer value and potential market impact. Here’s a breakdown of the key facts: Amount Transferred: 3,000 BTC Origin Exchange: Bitfinex Destination Exchange: Kraken Reported By: Whale Alert Estimated Value: Approximately $235 million (at the time of transfer) To put this into perspective, $235 million is a considerable sum in any market, but in the often volatile world of cryptocurrency, such a large transaction can trigger speculation and analysis. The immediate question on everyone’s mind is: Why? Bitfinex to Kraken: Unpacking the Exchange Dynamics Both Bitfinex and Kraken are well-established cryptocurrency exchanges, but they cater to slightly different segments of the market and have unique operational focuses. Understanding the nuances of these exchanges can offer clues about the rationale behind this Bitcoin whale transfer . Bitfinex , established in 2012, is known for its advanced trading features, margin trading options, and a strong presence in the professional trading community. It has historically been associated with sophisticated traders and institutional investors. Kraken , founded in 2011, is one of the oldest and most respected cryptocurrency exchanges globally. It’s recognized for its security, regulatory compliance, and a broad range of cryptocurrency offerings. Kraken is popular with both retail and institutional investors and is known for its fiat currency on-ramps and off-ramps. Considering these exchange profiles, several possibilities emerge for this Bitcoin whale transfer : Possible Reasons Description OTC Trade Settlement Large over-the-counter (OTC) trades are often settled through exchange transfers. A whale might have executed a large Bitcoin sale to a buyer who uses Kraken, necessitating the transfer for settlement. Liquidity Balancing Bitfinex might be rebalancing its Bitcoin reserves across different exchanges for operational or strategic reasons. Moving funds to Kraken could be part of a broader liquidity management strategy. Arbitrage Opportunities While less likely with such prominent exchanges, slight price discrepancies between Bitfinex and Kraken could create arbitrage opportunities. Whales might move funds to exploit these differences, although this is typically done with automated systems and smaller, more frequent transfers. Custodial Services The whale might be using Kraken’s custodial services for secure storage of their Bitcoin. Moving funds to Kraken could indicate a preference for their custody solutions. Preparations for Trading Activity The whale might be preparing to engage in significant trading activity on Kraken. Depositing a large amount of Bitcoin could be a precursor to buying other cryptocurrencies or engaging in margin trading on the Kraken platform. Impact on the Crypto Exchange Landscape and Market Sentiment While pinpointing the exact reason for this Bitcoin whale transfer is challenging without insider information, its occurrence does have implications for the crypto market and the exchanges involved. Potential Market Impact: Price Volatility: Large transfers can sometimes induce short-term price volatility, especially if the market interprets it as a potential sell-off. However, in this case, the transfer is from one exchange to another, which is less likely to immediately trigger selling pressure compared to a transfer to an unknown wallet. Market Sentiment: News of large whale transfers is always closely watched. It can influence market sentiment, sometimes creating fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) or, conversely, signaling confidence if interpreted as strategic positioning. Exchange Reputation: For Kraken , receiving such a substantial inflow of Bitcoin can be seen as a positive signal, reinforcing its position as a trusted and liquid exchange. For Bitfinex , outflows of this magnitude might raise questions, though it’s important to note that exchanges regularly manage large volumes of funds. Actionable Insights: What Can Crypto Traders Learn? Events like this Bitcoin whale transfer offer valuable lessons for crypto traders and investors: Stay Informed: Following crypto news sources like Whale Alert and reputable crypto media outlets is crucial. Staying informed about large transactions and market movements can help you anticipate potential market shifts. Understand Exchange Dynamics: Knowing the characteristics and user bases of different crypto exchanges like Bitfinex and Kraken provides context for interpreting on-chain data. Different exchanges attract different types of traders and serve various purposes within the ecosystem. Don’t Overreact to Whale Alerts: While significant, whale alerts should be interpreted cautiously. Not every large transfer leads to immediate price action. Analyze the context, the exchanges involved, and broader market trends before making trading decisions based solely on whale alerts. Focus on Long-Term Trends: While short-term volatility can be influenced by events like whale transfers, successful crypto investing often relies on understanding long-term trends, technological developments, and fundamental analysis rather than reacting to every short-term market signal. Conclusion: The Crypto Whale Watch Continues The Bitcoin whale transfer from Bitfinex to Kraken serves as a compelling reminder of the dynamic and often mysterious nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the precise motive behind this $235 million movement remains undisclosed, it underscores the importance of on-chain analysis, market awareness, and understanding the intricate web of crypto exchanges . As the crypto space matures, monitoring these large transactions and deciphering their potential implications will continue to be a fascinating and crucial aspect of navigating this exciting, albeit volatile, financial frontier.

Now, a crypto attorney is taking on a powerful government agency in a quest to shed light on this enduring mystery. James A. Murphy, known as “MetaLawMan” in the crypto sphere, has initiated a legal battle against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), demanding the release of documents that could potentially reveal the Satoshi Nakamoto identity .

To compel the agency to disclose records related to the elusive Bitcoin creator , Satoshi Nakamoto. Murphy alleges that his requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) have gone unanswered, prompting him to take legal action. This isn’t just about satisfying curiosity. Murphy argues that understanding the Satoshi Nakamoto identity is now more critical than ever, especially given the increasing regulatory interest in Bitcoin. Here’s a breakdown of why this lawsuit is significant: Unanswered FOIA Requests: Murphy claims his attempts to access information through the Freedom of Information Act have been ignored by the DHS. This act is designed to ensure transparency and public access to government information. Referencing a 2019 Interview: The lawsuit hinges on a 2019 interview where DHS Special Agent Rana Saoud reportedly mentioned that agents had interacted with four individuals involved in Bitcoin’s inception. This suggests the DHS might possess information about Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity. Relevance to Bitcoin’s Growth: Murphy emphasizes the growing importance of Bitcoin in the financial landscape. With the rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs and increasing federal and state scrutiny over Bitcoin reserves, knowing the origins of Bitcoin becomes crucial for regulatory clarity and market understanding. Public Interest: The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is a matter of intense public interest within the cryptocurrency community and beyond. Unveiling this identity could have significant implications for the perception and future of Bitcoin. The Freedom of Information Act and the Quest for Transparency At the heart of this legal battle is the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). This act grants the public the right to request access to federal agency records. Agencies are obligated to disclose requested information unless it falls under specific exemptions that protect interests such as national security or personal privacy. Murphy’s lawsuit argues that the information he seeks does not fall under these exemptions and is crucial for public understanding, especially in the context of Bitcoin’s growing significance. The lawsuit essentially challenges the DHS to either release the requested documents or provide a legitimate legal justification for withholding them. Here’s a simplified look at how the Freedom of Information Act works in this context: Step Action Description 1 FOIA Request James Murphy submits a formal request to the DHS for documents related to Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity. 2 Agency Response DHS is legally obligated to respond within a specific timeframe, either providing the documents or explaining why they cannot be released. 3 Lawsuit Filing Since Murphy claims his requests were unanswered, he files a lawsuit to compel the DHS to comply with the FOIA. 4 Court Decision The court will review the case and decide whether the DHS must release the documents or if their reasons for withholding are justified. Why Does Knowing the Bitcoin Creator Matter Now? The question arises: why is uncovering the Bitcoin creator ’s identity so important now? Bitcoin has been around for over a decade, and its decentralized nature is often touted as a key feature. However, several factors are converging that make this information increasingly relevant: Regulatory Scrutiny: Governments worldwide are grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies. Understanding the origins of Bitcoin, including who Satoshi Nakamoto is, could inform regulatory frameworks and policy decisions. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States marks a significant step towards mainstream adoption. Institutional investors are now entering the Bitcoin market, increasing the need for transparency and clarity about its foundations. Bitcoin Reserves and State Interest: As Bitcoin gains traction as a store of value, both federal and state entities are showing greater interest in Bitcoin reserves. Knowing the Satoshi Nakamoto identity could provide insights into the early motivations and potential vulnerabilities of the Bitcoin network. Market Confidence: For some, the anonymity of Satoshi Nakamoto adds an element of risk and uncertainty to Bitcoin. Unveiling the identity could either enhance or diminish market confidence, depending on who Satoshi turns out to be and their background. What Could the DHS Records Reveal About Satoshi Nakamoto Identity? If the court rules in favor of Murphy and compels the DHS to release the requested records, what kind of information might we expect to see? Based on the lawsuit and the referenced 2019 interview, the documents could potentially include: Identities of Individuals Met by DHS Agents: The records might name the four individuals DHS Special Agent Rana Saoud mentioned meeting in connection with Bitcoin’s creation. These could be key figures in the early development of Bitcoin. Communications and Internal DHS Assessments: The documents could contain internal DHS communications, reports, or assessments related to Satoshi Nakamoto and the origins of Bitcoin. Potential Leads and Investigations: The records might reveal any leads or investigations the DHS has conducted regarding Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity or the early days of Bitcoin. It’s important to note that the contents of these records are speculative at this point. The DHS may possess only limited information, or the information might be heavily redacted due to privacy or security concerns. However, even partial disclosure could offer valuable clues in the ongoing quest to unmask Satoshi Nakamoto. The Road Ahead: What’s Next in the DHS Lawsuit? The lawsuit is now before the District Court for the District of Columbia. The immediate next steps involve: DHS Response: The DHS will need to formally respond to the lawsuit, likely arguing why the documents should not be released, potentially citing exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act. Court Review: The court will review the arguments from both sides and determine whether to compel the DHS to release the documents. This process could involve legal filings, hearings, and judicial deliberation. Potential Appeal: Regardless of the initial ruling, either party could appeal the decision, potentially prolonging the legal battle. The outcome of this DHS lawsuit could set a precedent for future attempts to uncover information about decentralized technologies and their creators through legal means. It also highlights the increasing intersection of cryptocurrency, law, and government regulation. Conclusion: Will the Mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto Finally Unravel? James Murphy’s lawsuit against the DHS is a fascinating development in the long-standing mystery surrounding the Bitcoin creator . Whether it will successfully unlock the secrets of Satoshi Nakamoto identity remains to be seen. However, this legal challenge underscores the growing significance of Bitcoin and the increasing demand for transparency in the crypto space. The world watches with bated breath to see if this bold legal move will finally unveil one of the digital age’s most enduring enigmas.

With markets already reacting and Bitcoin’s sharp fluctuations underscoring broader investor nervousness, Dimon’s letter serves as a real-time cautionary tale rather than a distant forecast. As markets reel from tariff turbulence, Bitcoin and other digital assets are feeling the shockwaves. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon says that U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent tariffs may heighten the odds of a recession and prompt an economic slump in growth, his annual letter to shareholders reveals . Jamie Dimon Warns Of Tariff Concerns In the letter, Dimon warns that Trump’s controversial tariff policy will “likely increase inflation” and “slow down growth.” “There are many uncertainties surrounding the new tariff policy: the potential retaliatory actions, including on services, by other countries, the effect on confidence, the impact on investments and capital flows, the effect on corporate profits and the possible effect on the U.S. dollar,” he said.

Crypto markets were also drastically impacted by the turmoil, with Bitcoin hovering around $78,000 as of Monday afternoon. Earlier in the day, Bitcoin dropped below $75,000, with the cryptocurrency down 4.30% in the last five days. However, markets as a whole could get worse in the coming days given that Trump is planning to follow through with hiking up tariffs against China from 34% to 50% come April 9. On Monday afternoon, reports emerged that China had no intentions of backing down, with the country bringing their own reciprocal tariffs against the U.S. With Trump refusing to abandon his policy plans, only time will tell how heightened levels of global volatility will affect the digital asset sector long-term.

A fake news post on X on April 7 from the verified “Walter Bloomberg” account claimed that the White House was considering a 90-day pause on tariffs following an interview with Kevin Hassett, one of Donald Trump’s economic advisers. “Hassett: Trump is considering a 90-day pause in tariffs for all countries except China,” read the now-deleted post from the user, who is not affiliated with Bloomberg News. The account, which has a verified badge and 852,000 followers, caused quite a stir after the rumor was mistakenly aired as a banner on CNBC and then amplified by Reuters. The S&P 500 spiked more than 8% from its low on the day in reaction, the Nasdaq added 9.5% in less than an hour and the Dow Jones pumped 7%, adding trillions to stock markets. Bitcoin ( BTC ) prices saw a similar spike, with the asset pumping 6.5% to top $80,000 briefly before falling back again. The official White House “Rapid Response” account quickly posted on X that this was fake news, and markets began to dump again. “Market ready to ape” at a moment's notice While the rumor was debunked as fake, crypto YouTuber Lark Davis said that the episode revealed some critical things about the market. The market is ready to accept prolonged China negotiations as long as most deals can be resolved, he said before adding the “market is ready to ape, even a lame 90-day delay sent markets soaring.” “Now imagine what happens when dozens of deals are made with top players ie, India, Canada, and the UK. Shit tons of money is on the sidelines, ready to ape in at a moment's notice.” “That fake headline might actually give Trump, Navarro, and Lutnick more confidence to keep pushing this further,” commented X user Geiger Capital, who added, “They now know that at any point they can announce a pause and the market will rally ~10% in a single day.” What really happened in Hasset interview Fox News asked Hasset whether Trump would consider a 90-day pause in tariffs and was given a non-committal response. “I think the president is gonna decide what the president is gonna decide,” he said, adding: “Even if you think there will be some negative effect from the trade side, that’s still a small share of GDP.” Related: Billionaire investor would ‘not be surprised’ if Trump postpones tariffs “The idea that it's going to be a nuclear winter or something like that is completely irresponsible rhetoric,” he said.

The latest news from Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, is sending ripples of concern across the digital asset landscape. Buckle up as we delve into the details of a potentially massive Bitcoin loss and what it signifies for the broader crypto market volatility . Unveiling the $6 Billion Bitcoin Loss: What’s Happening at Strategy? Strategy, a company renowned for its aggressive embrace of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, has just dropped a bombshell. In a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), they’ve indicated an expected Bitcoin loss of a staggering $5.91 billion for the first quarter of this year. Yes, you read that right – billions . This figure reflects the dramatic decrease in the value of their substantial Bitcoin holdings during the period. Let’s break down what this means and why it’s a significant event: Unrealized Losses: The core issue here is ‘unrealized losses’. This means that while Strategy hasn’t actually sold their Bitcoin, the accounting rules require them to report the decrease in value as a loss on their books. It’s a paper loss, for now, but it still paints a concerning picture of the impact of crypto market volatility on corporate balance sheets. Difficulty in Profit Recovery: Strategy themselves have acknowledged a critical point. In their SEC filing, they highlighted that these unrealized losses related to digital assets could make it challenging to bounce back to profitability. This is a stark admission of the risks associated with holding volatile assets like Bitcoin, especially in large quantities. Tax Benefit Lifeline: It’s not all doom and gloom, though. There’s a silver lining, albeit a partial one. Strategy anticipates a substantial tax benefit of $1.69 billion, which will partially offset the massive unrealized losses. Think of it as a significant cushion, but it still leaves a substantial net loss. Digging Deeper: MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Bet – A Risky Strategy? Strategy’s (formerly MicroStrategy Bitcoin ) identity is now inextricably linked to Bitcoin. Under the leadership of Michael Saylor, the company made headlines by adopting Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. This bold move was lauded by some as visionary and criticized by others as reckless. This expected Bitcoin loss for Q1 puts their strategy under intense scrutiny. Let’s consider the context: Aggressive Bitcoin Accumulation: Over the years, MicroStrategy aggressively accumulated Bitcoin, using corporate funds and even raising debt to purchase more. Their holdings are substantial, making them one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin globally. Belief in Long-Term Value: MicroStrategy’s bet on Bitcoin is fundamentally based on a strong belief in its long-term value proposition as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. They view short-term price fluctuations as noise in the grand scheme of things. Impact of Market Downturn: The first quarter of the year witnessed significant turbulence in the cryptocurrency markets. Various factors, including macroeconomic uncertainties, regulatory concerns, and geopolitical events, contributed to a sharp downturn in Bitcoin’s price. This downturn directly translates into the massive unrealized losses for companies like Strategy holding substantial Bitcoin. Decoding the Q1 Earnings Report: More Than Just Bitcoin Losses? While the headline figure is undoubtedly the $6 billion Bitcoin loss , the full Q1 earnings report from Strategy will offer a more comprehensive picture of the company’s financial health. Investors and analysts will be keenly watching for details beyond just the Bitcoin write-down. Key areas to watch in the Q1 earnings report : Area Significance Revenue Performance How is Strategy’s core software business performing? Is it growing, declining, or stagnant? This provides insights into the fundamental strength of the company beyond its Bitcoin holdings. Operating Expenses Are expenses under control? Efficiency in operations is crucial, especially when faced with significant asset value depreciation. Overall Net Income/Loss While the Bitcoin loss is a major factor, the overall net income or loss will reflect the combined impact of all business operations and financial activities. Future Outlook & Guidance What is Strategy’s outlook for the rest of the year? Are they adjusting their Bitcoin strategy? Management’s commentary will be crucial in understanding their plan moving forward. Navigating Crypto Investment Risk: Lessons from Strategy’s Situation Strategy’s predicament serves as a stark reminder of the inherent cryptocurrency investment risk , especially for institutional investors venturing into this volatile asset class. While Bitcoin holds immense potential, it also comes with significant price fluctuations that can dramatically impact financial statements. Key takeaways regarding cryptocurrency investment risk : Volatility is Inherent: Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, are known for their high volatility. Price swings of 10%, 20%, or even more in a short period are not uncommon. Investors must be prepared for these fluctuations. Diversification Matters: Putting a significant portion of treasury reserves into a single volatile asset like Bitcoin can amplify both potential gains and potential losses. Diversification across different asset classes is a fundamental risk management principle. Accounting Implications: Current accounting standards treat cryptocurrencies as intangible assets, leading to potential volatility in reported earnings due to unrealized gains and losses. Companies need to understand these accounting rules and their impact on financial reporting. Long-Term Perspective vs. Short-Term Pain: Strategy’s long-term conviction in Bitcoin might eventually pay off if Bitcoin’s price recovers and appreciates significantly. However, in the short term, they are facing substantial paper losses and potential investor concern. Actionable Insights: What Can Investors and Companies Learn? So, what can we learn from Strategy’s experience? Here are some actionable insights for both investors and companies considering cryptocurrency investments: For Investors: Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Are you comfortable with the high volatility of crypto assets? Invest only what you can afford to lose. Do Your Research: Don’t blindly follow the hype. Understand the fundamentals of the cryptocurrencies you are investing in. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially in a volatile asset class. For Companies: Assess the Risks and Rewards: Thoroughly evaluate the potential benefits and risks of holding cryptocurrencies as treasury assets. Develop a Risk Management Strategy: Implement strategies to manage the volatility and potential downsides of crypto investments. Seek Expert Advice: Consult with financial advisors and accounting professionals to navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency investments and reporting. Conclusion: Navigating the Unpredictable Crypto Seas Strategy’s expected $6 billion Bitcoin loss serves as a stark reminder of the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the potential for high returns is alluring, the risks are equally significant. For investors and companies alike, a cautious, informed, and risk-aware approach is paramount when navigating the often unpredictable crypto seas. The crypto market volatility is a force to be reckoned with, and Strategy’s Q1 experience provides a valuable, albeit painful, lesson in the realities of digital asset investment.

The goal is to create a regulated and inclusive ecosystem that can draw capital and position the country as a competitive player in the global digital economy. Pakistan Signals Policy Shift With Launch of Crypto Council and Global Consultations Crypto adoption is already gaining ground in Pakistan, a country of over 230m people. Despite earlier warnings from the central bank about the risks of digital assets, interest in the space is growing. Trading and blockchain technology continue to gain traction, especially among younger populations. The Pakistan Crypto Council was formally launched last month . Led by Bilal Bin Saqib as CEO and chaired by Aurangzeb, the council brings together senior regulators and aims to establish clear guidelines while learning from international counterparts. “Pakistan is no longer avoiding crypto. It is preparing to embrace it responsibly,” Saqib told Cryptonews recently. The PCC has already begun consulting with global regulators in El Salvador, Nigeria, Malaysia and the European Union, signalling Pakistan’s intent to draw on international best practices.

A significant announcement just dropped from one of the biggest names in the game. Coinbase, the leading cryptocurrency exchange, has declared its intent to suspend trading for two lesser-known, but still relevant, digital assets: Gemini Dollar (GUSD) and GYEN (GYEN). If you’re holding these tokens on Coinbase, you need to pay close attention. Let’s dive into the details of this critical development and what it means for you. Why is Coinbase Delisting GUSD and GYEN? Coinbase officially announced the delisting via a post on X (formerly Twitter). The message was concise and to the point, stating that trading of GUSD and GYEN will be suspended on May 7th, at approximately 2 p.m. ET . While Coinbase didn’t explicitly state the reasons behind this decision in their public announcement, exchange delistings are often driven by a variety of factors. Let’s explore some potential reasons: Low Trading Volume and Liquidity: GUSD and GYEN might not be generating sufficient trading activity on Coinbase to justify their continued listing. Exchanges prefer to support assets with robust trading volumes to ensure liquidity for their users. Low liquidity can lead to wider bid-ask spreads and slippage, making trading less efficient. Regulatory Scrutiny: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving. It’s possible that GUSD or GYEN, or their issuers, are facing increased regulatory scrutiny that makes Coinbase uncomfortable continuing to offer trading support. Stablecoins, like GUSD, in particular, have been under the regulatory microscope globally. Strategic Realignment: Coinbase may be strategically focusing on supporting a narrower range of cryptocurrencies that align with their long-term vision and compliance standards. Delisting less popular or potentially riskier assets can streamline operations and reduce compliance burdens. Issuer-Specific Issues: There could be specific issues related to the issuers of GUSD (Gemini) and GYEN (GMO-Z.com Trust Company) that have prompted Coinbase’s decision. This could range from technical issues to business decisions at the issuer level. It’s important to remember that these are potential reasons, and Coinbase has not officially confirmed any of them. Regardless of the exact cause, the impact on users remains the same. Understanding GUSD Suspension and GYEN Delisting: What are These Cryptocurrencies? For those less familiar, let’s briefly understand what GUSD and GYEN are: Gemini Dollar (GUSD): GUSD is a stablecoin issued by Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins. It is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar and aims to provide a stable and regulated digital representation of USD on the blockchain. Stablecoins are designed to minimize price volatility, making them useful for trading, remittances, and as a safe haven asset in the crypto space. GYEN (GYEN): GYEN is a stablecoin pegged to the Japanese Yen, issued by GMO-Z.com Trust Company. It aims to provide a stable digital representation of the Japanese Yen. Like other stablecoins, GYEN is intended to offer stability relative to its fiat currency peg, in this case, the Yen. While both are stablecoins, they represent different fiat currencies and are issued by different entities. Despite their stablecoin nature, they are still subject to exchange listing and delisting decisions based on market dynamics and exchange policies. Impact of the Trading Suspension on Crypto Exchange Users The most immediate impact of this announcement is on users who currently hold GUSD and/or GYEN on Coinbase. Here’s what you need to know: Trading Ceases on May 7th: After approximately 2 p.m. ET on May 7th, you will no longer be able to trade GUSD or GYEN on Coinbase. This means you cannot buy, sell, or convert these tokens on the platform. Access to Funds Remains: Coinbase has clarified that while trading will be suspended, users will still have access to their GUSD and GYEN holdings. You will be able to withdraw your tokens from Coinbase even after the trading suspension takes effect. Action is Required: If you hold GUSD or GYEN on Coinbase and intend to continue trading or using these tokens, you will need to take action before May 7th. Waiting until after the suspension could limit your options and potentially lead to inconvenience. Actionable Insights: What Should GUSD and GYEN Holders Do? If you are affected by this trading suspension , here are some actionable steps you can take: Decide Your Next Move: First, determine what you want to do with your GUSD and GYEN holdings. Do you want to continue holding them, trade them, or convert them to other assets? Withdraw Your Tokens: The most prudent step is to withdraw your GUSD and GYEN from Coinbase. You can transfer them to a self-custodial wallet where you control your private keys or to another cryptocurrency exchange that continues to support trading for these tokens. Explore Alternative Exchanges: Research other crypto exchanges that list GUSD and GYEN. Exchanges like Gemini (for GUSD, naturally) and potentially others may still offer trading pairs. Be sure to check the liquidity and trading volumes on these alternative platforms. Convert to Other Assets: If you don’t have a strong preference for holding GUSD or GYEN specifically, consider converting them to other cryptocurrencies that are widely supported and have robust liquidity on Coinbase or other exchanges. Popular options include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), or other major altcoins. You can do this on Coinbase before the May 7th deadline. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from Coinbase, Gemini, and GMO-Z.com Trust Company for any further updates or clarifications regarding this delisting. Broader Implications for the Crypto Market and Crypto Exchange Strategies Coinbase’s decision to suspend trading for GUSD and GYEN reflects broader trends in the cryptocurrency market and the evolving strategies of crypto exchanges: Exchange Optimization: Exchanges are constantly evaluating their asset listings to optimize for trading volume, regulatory compliance, and user demand. Delisting less popular or potentially problematic assets is a part of this ongoing optimization process. Focus on Core Assets: Major exchanges like Coinbase are increasingly focusing on supporting a core set of established and highly liquid cryptocurrencies. This allows them to concentrate resources on compliance, security, and infrastructure for these key assets. Stablecoin Landscape Evolution: The stablecoin market is dynamic and competitive. While GUSD and GYEN are regulated stablecoins, they face competition from larger and more widely adopted stablecoins like USDT and USDC. Exchange listings often reflect market dominance and user preference. Regulatory Pressure: The increasing regulatory scrutiny on the crypto industry, particularly on stablecoins, is likely influencing exchange decisions regarding asset listings. Exchanges are becoming more cautious and may preemptively delist assets that could pose regulatory risks. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Crypto Holders The upcoming trading suspension of GUSD and GYEN on Coinbase serves as a timely reminder of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. For holders of these specific tokens, it’s a call to action to review your positions and make informed decisions before the deadline. More broadly, it underscores the importance of staying informed about exchange announcements and being prepared to adapt to changes in the crypto landscape. Always remember to diversify your holdings and avoid keeping significant amounts of crypto on any single exchange for extended periods.

Galaxy chooses Delaware for favorable corporate environment In the SEC Form S-4, first filed on March 27, Galaxy said it chose Delaware for the relocation because it would provide “a favorable corporate environment,” which would help it “compete more effectively with other publicly traded companies.” The firm also chose Delaware because it’s the “choice of domicile for many publicly traded corporations,” has an abundance of case law to assist in interpreting the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL), and lawmakers frequently update the DGCL to reflect current technology and legal trends. After the change, Novogratz will maintain control of the company with nearly 60% of voting power, according to the filing. Galaxy Digital’s share price on the TSX was down 8% after the bell, trading at $12.30 Canadian dollars ($8.70), according to Google Finance.

Whispers of deceit have emerged, casting a shadow over the much-hyped Llama 4 AI model. Crypto and tech enthusiasts alike are watching closely as accusations fly, questioning the integrity of Meta’s latest AI marvel. Did they truly boost AI benchmarks artificially, or is this just another case of online speculation gone wild? Let’s dive into the heart of this controversy and uncover the facts. Did Meta Deceptively Inflate Llama 4’s AI Benchmarks? Over the weekend, the internet buzzed with rumors suggesting that Meta, the tech giant behind Facebook and Instagram, had strategically trained its new AI models , specifically Llama 4 Maverick and Llama 4 Scout, to excel in AI benchmarks . The accusation? That this training was designed to mask potential weaknesses and present a misleadingly positive picture of the models’ capabilities. This explosive claim, originating from a disgruntled ex-Meta employee on a Chinese social media platform, quickly spread across X and Reddit, igniting a firestorm of debate within the AI and tech communities. The core of the accusation revolves around the concept of ‘test sets’ in AI benchmarks . Think of test sets as the final exam for an AI model. They are datasets used to evaluate how well a model performs *after* it has been trained. If a company were to train its model *on* these test sets, it would be akin to giving the model the answer key before the exam. This practice, if true, would artificially inflate the benchmark scores , making the model seem far more competent than it actually is in real-world applications. Meta’s Swift Denial: Setting the Record Straight In response to the escalating rumors, Ahmad Al-Dahle, Meta’s VP of generative AI, wasted no time in issuing a firm denial. Taking to X, Al-Dahle stated unequivocally that the allegations were “simply not true.” He explicitly refuted the claim that Meta trained its Llama 4 Maverick and Llama 4 Scout models on test sets used for AI benchmarks . This direct and public denial is a crucial step in damage control, but does it fully quell the rising tide of skepticism? Fueling the Fire: Reports of Inconsistent Performance Several factors have contributed to the rapid spread and persistence of these rumors: Whispers of Weaknesses: Reports have surfaced suggesting that Maverick and Scout, despite their impressive benchmark scores , exhibit less-than-stellar performance in certain practical tasks. This discrepancy between benchmark results and real-world application has understandably raised eyebrows. The LM Arena Factor: Meta’s decision to showcase an experimental, unreleased version of Maverick on the popular LM Arena AI benchmark platform has further fueled suspicion. Researchers observing the publicly available Maverick versus the version on LM Arena have reported noticeable differences in behavior and performance. Mixed Quality Across Platforms: Al-Dahle himself acknowledged user reports of “mixed quality” from Maverick and Scout when accessed through different cloud providers. While he attributed this to the initial rollout phase and ongoing optimizations, it nonetheless adds to the perception of inconsistency. The Race to Deployment: Speed vs. Stability? Al-Dahle’s explanation for the reported inconsistencies points to a rapid deployment strategy. He stated that Meta released the Llama 4 models “as soon as they were ready,” anticipating that it would take several days for public implementations to fully stabilize across various platforms. This “release early, iterate quickly” approach is common in the tech world, but in the sensitive domain of AI models , especially those touted as groundbreaking, it can invite scrutiny and skepticism if not managed transparently. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI Transparency? This episode highlights the growing importance of transparency and accountability in the development and evaluation of AI models . As AI becomes increasingly integrated into various aspects of our lives, from cryptocurrency trading algorithms to everyday applications, the need for trust and verifiable performance metrics becomes paramount. Here are some key takeaways from this unfolding situation: Benchmark Skepticism: The incident underscores the potential limitations of relying solely on AI benchmarks as definitive measures of model capability. While benchmarks provide a standardized way to compare models, they can be susceptible to manipulation or may not fully reflect real-world performance. The Power of Community Scrutiny: The rapid spread of rumors and the ensuing public discourse demonstrate the power of online communities, particularly within the AI research and open-source spaces, to scrutinize and hold tech giants accountable. Need for Clear Communication: Meta’s prompt response is commendable, but going forward, proactive and transparent communication regarding model development, evaluation methodologies, and potential limitations will be crucial for building and maintaining trust. Navigating the AI Hype Cycle: A Word of Caution The AI landscape is rife with hype and bold claims. While advancements in AI models like Llama 4 are genuinely exciting and hold immense potential, it’s essential to approach them with a healthy dose of skepticism. Don’t be swayed by inflated benchmark scores alone. Look for independent evaluations, real-world performance data, and transparent reporting from developers. The true measure of an AI model’s success lies not just in its ability to ace a test, but in its practical utility and positive impact on the world. The controversy surrounding Llama 4 ’s benchmark scores serves as a potent reminder: in the rapidly evolving world of AI, critical thinking and informed analysis are more vital than ever. As the technology matures and its influence expands, demanding transparency and rigorous evaluation will be key to ensuring responsible and beneficial AI development.

Fears of a prolonged trade war are now at an all time high. In a statement on Tuesday, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce slammed Washington’s plan to impose additional tariffs as “a mistake on top of a mistake.” The statement further added, “If the US insists on its own way, China will fight to the end.” This came after Trump vowed to impose an additional 50% import tax on Chinese goods if Beijing did not withdraw its recent retaliatory duties. According to a White House official, the new move would bring total announced tariffs this year to 104%, building on a 34% “reciprocal” increase set for April 9 and a 20% hike introduced earlier. Authorities in China signaled they will not back down easily. “The rhetoric from China is strong,” commented Michelle Lam, greater China economist at Societe Generale. Michelle Lam added, “Without Trump backing down investors may need to prepare for trade decoupling between both countries.” Despite the tension, the Ministry of Commerce left room for discussion, though Trump threatened to halt all talks if Beijing fails to comply. As the confrontation heated up, Chinese officials turned to market-support measures. They loosened their grip on the yuan to help exporters and directed a group of state-backed funds, known as the national team, to buy up assets. China’s onshore yuan slipped to its lowest since September 2023 Reports also suggested that some stimulus might be moved forward to stabilize the economy. Even so, the onshore yuan slipped to its weakest point since September 2023, and the offshore yuan touched a two-month low on Tuesday. A day after logging its worst dive since the financial crisis, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index surged as much as 2.26%. Hang Seng China Enterprises Index. Source: Google Finance Political tensions show no sign of easing. Observers note that Trump, who returned to the White House earlier this year, has not spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping since taking office again. It marks the longest a US leader has gone without contacting a Chinese counterpart in two decades. Analysts worry that lack of direct engagement could inflame the trade war. China’s reduced dependence on American demand may blunt the impact of tariffs, yet trade watchers warn that continued escalation could harm both economies. For now, investors worldwide remain on edge, fearing further escalation if neither side backs off from their stance. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

This new ETF, called XXRP, will give investors a way to trade XRP with a 2x leverage, meaning it aims to double the returns based on XRP’s daily price changes. This launch comes at a time when more investors are looking for ways to invest in altcoins like XRP. There are even more XRP ETFs waiting for approval from the SEC, along with ETFs for other cryptocurrencies like Solana. The excitement also comes after some good news for XRP’s legal troubles.

Here’s a breakdown of what Nova Reel 1.1 brings to the table: Extended Video Length: Users can now generate videos up to two minutes long, a significant increase from previous limitations. Multi-Shot Capability: The model can create videos composed of multiple six-second shots, providing a more dynamic viewing experience. Consistent Style: Maintaining a uniform visual style across shots ensures a cohesive and professional look for the generated videos. “Multishot Manual” Mode: This new mode allows users to provide a reference image alongside a text prompt, offering greater control over shot composition. Imagine tailoring the visual aesthetic of your video generation to perfectly match your brand or message. For content creators, especially those in the fast-paced world of crypto and blockchain, the implications are huge. Think about: Rapid Content Creation: Quickly generate explainer videos on complex crypto concepts, market analysis, or project updates. Engaging Social Media Content: Create eye-catching short videos for platforms like Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram to boost community engagement and reach. Educational Resources: Develop comprehensive video tutorials and guides on blockchain technology, DeFi, NFTs, and more, making complex topics accessible to a wider audience. How Does Nova Reel 1.1 Work? Delving into the Technical Details Nova Reel 1.1 operates by allowing users to input prompts of up to 4,000 characters to generate these longer videos. The “Multishot Manual” mode is particularly interesting. By supplying a 1280×720 resolution image and a prompt of up to 512 characters, users can guide the model to create videos with up to 20 shots. This level of control opens up exciting possibilities for creative direction in AI video length and content. Currently, Nova Reel is exclusively accessible through AWS platforms and services, including Bedrock, Amazon’s AI development suite. Access is granted upon request, suggesting that Amazon is taking a measured approach to its rollout. This exclusivity might be strategic, allowing Amazon to refine the model based on user feedback and control its initial impact on the market. The Ethical Tightrope: Copyright Concerns in AI Video Generation As with any powerful generative video technology, ethical considerations are paramount. The development of these models relies on vast datasets of existing videos, raising questions about copyright and intellectual property. Concerns linger about whether these models are trained using ethically sourced data. If copyrighted videos are used without proper authorization, the resulting video generation could inadvertently reproduce copyrighted material, potentially exposing users to legal risks. Amazon, while not explicitly detailing the source of Nova Reel’s training data or offering a clear opt-out for creators, has addressed the copyright issue through its indemnification policy. They have stated they will protect AWS customers from copyright infringement claims related to media generated by their models. This is a significant reassurance for businesses and creators venturing into AI video model utilization. Key considerations surrounding the ethical aspects include: Data Transparency: Lack of clarity on the training data sources for AI video model s raises concerns about potential copyright infringement. Creator Rights: The absence of a straightforward opt-out mechanism for content creators to prevent their videos from being used in training datasets is a point of contention. Legal Liabilities: While indemnification policies offer some protection, the legal landscape surrounding AI-generated content is still evolving, creating uncertainty. The Future of Video Content: AI and Beyond Amazon’s Nova Reel 1.1 is a significant stride forward in the realm of AI video generation . The ability to create longer, more controlled, and stylistically consistent videos opens up a universe of possibilities for content creators across various industries, including the burgeoning cryptocurrency and blockchain sector. As these technologies mature, we can expect even more sophisticated features and applications to emerge, further blurring the lines between human and AI creativity. For crypto enthusiasts and businesses, embracing these AI video model advancements could be a game-changer in how they communicate, educate, and engage with their audiences. The potential to streamline content creation, enhance visual storytelling, and reach new demographics is immense. However, navigating the ethical and legal considerations will be crucial to harnessing the full power of this revolutionary technology responsibly.

The delay gives tax authorities more time to respond to Binance’s request to cancel a court order that allowed documents to be sent by email, Reuters reported on Monday. Binance’s legal counsel, Chukwuka Ikwuazom, said the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) did not get court approval to serve documents outside Nigeria. He argued that the Feb. 11 order allowing substituted service was invalid. Binance is registered in the Cayman Islands and does not have a physical office in Nigeria. Consequently, the order for substituted service is “improper and should be set aside,” Ikwuazom said. The legal challenge could complicate what is already one of the most significant cases in Nigeria’s crackdown on crypto platforms. A Nigerian court has adjourned a tax evasion case against Binance to April 30 to allow the local tax authority to respond to a request by the cryptocurrency exchange to annul an order for court documents to be served on it by email https://t.co/OWHAFCnNqK — The Nation Nigeria (@TheNationNews) April 8, 2025 Nigeria Seeks $81.5B from Binance Over Tax and Market Disruption Claims The Nigerian government filed the lawsuit in February, accusing Binance with tax evasion and economic disruption . Authorities are seeking $81.5b in total. This includes $2b in back taxes and $79.5b for alleged economic damages. The FIRS alleges Binance’s peer-to-peer platform enabled unregulated trading. Further, it claims this activity worsened the depreciation of the naira. The currency has dropped over over 70% in value against the US dollar since 2023. Government Cites Binance’s Local Activity in Push for Tax Compliance With inflation approaching 30% in 2024, Nigerian officials have blamed unregulated crypto activity for weakening the country’s financial stability. Binance has been active in Nigeria since at least 2019. It reportedly processed more than $21.6b in transaction volume in 2023. As a result, the FIRS says Binance has a significant economic presence in Nigeria. It argues the exchange should be held accountable under the Companies Income Tax Act. Therefore, the agency is asking the court to order Binance to pay corporate income taxes for 2022 and 2023. It is also seeking a 10% penalty on unpaid amounts and 26.75% interest based on the Central Bank of Nigeria’s lending rate. The case marks one of the government’s most aggressive moves to rein in the influence of digital asset platforms.

BTC price has already bounced back from yesterday’s lows of $74,400, and is currently trading north of $80,000 levels as of press time. Investors are waiting for a better negotiation in the trade deal while leaving behind the volatility. Arthur Hayes Explains Why Chinese Money Could Enter Bitcoin Amid uncertainty in global monetary trends, market players are looking at China’s potential influence on Bitcoin. Arthur Hayes argues that a devaluation of the Chinese yuan (CNY) could drive capital outflows into BTC, reviving a trend seen in 2013 and 2015. With $USDCNH nearing five-year highs, whispers of a possible policy shift are gaining momentum. Hayes further establishes the link between a weaker Yuan and the Bitcoin nexus. He stated that Yuan devaluation, spurred by China’s independent monetary policy, is seen as a strategic move by President Xi Jinping to sustain economic competitiveness. As per Arthur Hayes, this creates a bullish narrative for Bitcoin as Chinese capital seeks alternative avenues amid the devaluation. While many doubt that China’s leadership will fundamentally alter its stance, the current trajectory of the yuan suggests that authorities may soon step in to arrest the decline. Trade War Tensions At New High US President Donald Trump is in no mood to back down on his tariffs, especially on China, as the two largest global economies escalate the trade war further. In further escalation, Trump announced plans to impose an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports , bringing the total tariffs on goods from China to 104%. This would combine the existing 20% and 34% tariffs with the new levy. The United States imports approximately $439 billion worth of goods from China annually. President Trump has given China until April 8 to rescind its 34% tariff on U.S. goods, warning that failure to do so will activate additional measures. However, Chinese officials have issued a firm statement, declaring they will “fight until the end” against the proposed tariffs. Where Is BTC Price Heading Next? As per the Bitcoin falling wedge pattern, the BTC price has bounced back from the crucial support and is currently trading 4.54% up at $80,336, with daily trading volumes surging 85% to more than $86 billion. Bitcoin is likely to rebound toward the critical $85,000 resistance level, a point where substantial selling pressure could emerge. Source: Captain Faibik Renowned crypto analyst Rekt Capital also believes that the Bitcoin bottom formation could be in amid the ongoing market correction. To forecast this, the analyst highlights historical trends in Bitcoin’s daily Relative Strength Index (RSI). According to the analyst, the current price levels, extending up to approximately $70,000, are likely to represent the lower boundary of this downturn. Our BTC price prediction indicator shows the asset to flirt around $77,000 over the next month.

43063099,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147200,1744088425,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Visionary Move: Riot Executive Unveils Groundbreaking Bitcoin Bond Company,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-bond-company-institutional-investment/,"In a groundbreaking development for the cryptocurrency space, Pierre Rochard, VP of Research at Riot Platforms, a prominent player in Bitcoin mining, has announced the launch of The Bitcoin Bond Company. This initiative signals a significant step towards bridging the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. For institutional investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin’s potential without direct cryptocurrency holdings, this new venture could be a game-changer. Let’s delve into what The Bitcoin Bond Company entails and its potential impact on the future of institutional investment in Bitcoin. What is The Bitcoin Bond Company and Why Bitcoin Bond? The Bitcoin Bond Company, spearheaded by the experienced Pierre Rochard, aims to create a transparent and regulated financial product – the Bitcoin bond – that allows institutions to invest in Bitcoin’s long-term growth narrative. Unlike directly purchasing and holding Bitcoin, which can involve complexities around custody and regulatory uncertainties for larger institutions, Bitcoin bonds offer a familiar and structured investment vehicle. Here’s a breakdown of why this is significant: Bridging Traditional Finance and Crypto: Bitcoin bonds can act as a crucial bridge, making it easier for traditional financial institutions, pension funds, and other large investors to allocate capital to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Transparency and Regulation: The company emphasizes transparency, suggesting a commitment to regulatory compliance, which is paramount for attracting institutional capital. Long-Term Bitcoin Growth Focus: The product is specifically designed for investors who believe in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, tapping into the potential for capital appreciation over time. Familiar Investment Structure: Bonds are a well-understood financial instrument, making it easier for institutions to incorporate Bitcoin exposure into their existing portfolios and risk management frameworks. Pierre Rochard and Riot Platforms: The Vision Behind the Venture Pierre Rochard, VP of Research at Riot Platforms, founder of The Bitcoin Bond Company Pierre Rochard’s background at Riot Platforms , a publicly traded Bitcoin mining company, lends credibility and expertise to The Bitcoin Bond Company. Riot Platforms is a major player in the Bitcoin mining industry, providing Rochard with deep insights into the Bitcoin ecosystem, its infrastructure, and its long-term potential. His decision to launch this venture signals a strong belief in the maturation of the Bitcoin market and the growing demand for regulated and accessible investment products. Riot Platforms itself benefits from this initiative indirectly. Increased institutional investment in Bitcoin, facilitated by products like Bitcoin bonds, can drive up the price of Bitcoin, positively impacting the profitability of Bitcoin mining operations like Riot. This move can be seen as a strategic effort to further legitimize Bitcoin as an asset class and expand its investor base. Benefits of Investing in Bitcoin Bonds for Institutions Why should institutions consider adding Bitcoin bonds to their investment portfolios? Here are some compelling benefits: Benefit Description Diversification: Bitcoin, as a nascent asset class, offers portfolio diversification benefits due to its low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds. Bitcoin bonds provide a structured way to access this diversification. Potential for High Returns: Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant price appreciation, outperforming many traditional asset classes. Bitcoin bonds offer a potential avenue to capture these high returns within a bond framework. Reduced Operational Complexity: Compared to direct Bitcoin ownership, Bitcoin bonds simplify custody, security, and regulatory compliance for institutional investors. Familiarity and Structure: Bonds are a well-understood investment instrument. Bitcoin bonds allow institutions to invest in Bitcoin using a familiar framework, aligning with existing investment policies and procedures. Transparency: The Bitcoin Bond Company emphasizes transparency, aiming to provide clear and accessible information about the bond structure and underlying Bitcoin exposure. Challenges and Considerations for Bitcoin Bonds While Bitcoin bonds present exciting opportunities, it’s crucial to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations: Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrency-related financial products is still evolving. Clarity and consistent regulations are essential for the widespread adoption of Bitcoin bonds. Volatility of Bitcoin: Bitcoin’s price volatility remains a significant factor. The value of Bitcoin bonds will be inherently linked to Bitcoin’s price fluctuations, requiring careful risk management. Credit Risk: The creditworthiness of The Bitcoin Bond Company itself will be a factor. Investors will need to assess the company’s financial stability and operational capabilities. Liquidity: The liquidity of Bitcoin bonds in the secondary market will need to be established. Active trading and sufficient market depth are important for institutional investors. Understanding Bitcoin Technology: While Bitcoin bonds simplify access, investors still need a basic understanding of Bitcoin and the underlying technology to assess the risks and potential rewards appropriately. Actionable Insights: Is Bitcoin Bond Right for Institutional Investment? The launch of The Bitcoin Bond Company is a noteworthy development that could reshape institutional investment in Bitcoin. For institutions considering Bitcoin exposure, Bitcoin bonds offer a potentially attractive pathway. However, thorough due diligence is paramount. Actionable Steps for Institutions: Conduct Comprehensive Research: Understand the structure of the Bitcoin bonds offered by The Bitcoin Bond Company, including fees, terms, and underlying Bitcoin exposure. Assess Risk Tolerance: Evaluate the institution’s risk appetite and determine an appropriate allocation to Bitcoin bonds within the overall portfolio. Consider Bitcoin’s volatility and potential downside risks. Engage with The Bitcoin Bond Company: Directly engage with the company to understand their regulatory compliance approach, security measures, and transparency practices. Seek Expert Advice: Consult with financial advisors and cryptocurrency experts to gain a deeper understanding of Bitcoin bonds and their suitability for the institution’s investment objectives. Start with a Pilot Allocation: Consider a phased approach, starting with a smaller pilot allocation to Bitcoin bonds to gain experience and assess performance before making larger commitments. Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin and Institutional Finance? Pierre Rochard’s initiative to launch The Bitcoin Bond Company marks a potentially transformative moment for Bitcoin and institutional investment . By offering a regulated, transparent, and familiar investment vehicle, it could unlock significant institutional capital flows into the Bitcoin market. While challenges and risks remain, the emergence of Bitcoin bonds signals a growing maturity and acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class within the traditional financial landscape. This venture could pave the way for broader institutional adoption of Bitcoin, driving further Bitcoin growth and solidifying its position in the global financial system.

In a quick-fire series of conflicting updates, the rumor initially floated at around 10:10 AM ET, sparked momentum in risk assets, and was eventually deemed “fake news” by the White House. The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) described the chronology on X, noting: “What just happened? At 10:10 AM ET, rumors emerged that the White House was considering a ‘90-day tariff pause.’ At 10:15 AM ET, CNBC reported that Trump is considering a 90-day pause on tariffs for ALL countries except for China. By 10:18 AM ET, the S&P 500 had added over +$3 TRILLION in market cap from its low.” Related Reading: Understanding Bitcoin Struggles: Why Realized Cap Indicates A Bear Market However, only seven minutes later, at 10:25 AM ET, reports emerged that the White House was ‘unaware’ of Trump considering a 90-day pause. “At 10:26 AM ET, CNBC reports that the 90-day tariff pause headlines were incorrect. At 10:34 AM ET, the White House officially called the tariff pause headlines ‘fake news.’ By 10:40 AM ET, the S&P 500 erased -$2.5 TRILLION of market cap from its high, 22 minutes prior. Never in history have we seen something like this,” The Kobeissi Letter writes. The mere suggestion of a temporary reprieve from tariffs managed to shift sentiment rapidly in both equity and crypto markets. BTC, which was trading around $75,805 at the time, soared by roughly 7.2% to surpass $81,200 within half an hour. Once confirmation arrived that no such pause was planned, the gains evaporated almost as fast as they had arrived, pulling Bitcoin back to roughly $77,560. The abrupt turn of events unleashed a wave of commentary among crypto observers. Pentoshi (@Pentosh1) remarked that “The fake news tweet showed there’s a lot of sidelined capital at least for relief rally and the risk is to the upside on any positive news at least temporarily.” Will Clemente III cautioned: “Bear take: Liquidity is bad and this volatility might break something. Bull take: This headline was the cointelegraph intern BTC ETF headline but for equities.” Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Bullish Fate Hinges On These 2 Resistance Zones – Details Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant, remarked that “Bitcoin’s current price drawdown is about to become the largest of the current cycle,” illustrating his point with a chart that showed BTC’s correction reaching -26.62%, matching the scale of August 2024’s correction. Macro analyst Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) invoked BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s observation that another 20% market drop is not out of the question, saying: “That’s the thing. Under normal circumstances, probability of such scenarios or things such as stagflation are so low you can just brush them off. Trump opened up the left tail => anything is possible. We are one headline away from a 7% candle in either direction.” Podcast host Felix Jauvin (@fejau_inc) agrees: “What’s so crazy about this crash vs other is its entirely self-willed and could be reversed in an instant on one tweet. Has there ever been anything like that?” In the midst of the turmoil, European Union Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen reaffirmed a willingness to seek solutions, stating, “Europe is ready to negotiate with the US,” including the possibility of zero-for-zero tariffs on industrial goods. At press time, BTC traded at $78,824.

XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has seen renewed attention after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently ended a multi-year legal battle with Ripple Labs, the token’s creator. The resolution, which required Ripple to pay $50 million , comes as part of a broader trend of dropped enforcement cases following President Donald Trump’s return to office. XXRP carries a 1.85% management fee and may include XRP futures or other instruments in the future, according to its prospectus. While XRP does not currently have active futures listings on major commodities exchanges, Teucrium’s offering signals growing institutional interest in altcoins beyond Bitcoin and Ether. Spot XRP ETF Yet to be Approved by SEC Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas posted on X that XRP ETF launch as “very odd”, pointing out that it may be the first instance of an asset’s debut ETF being a leveraged product. Balchunas also added that while a spot XRP ETF has not yet been approved, the likelihood of approval appears high. The ETF’s debut follows the SEC’s greenlighting of Solana futures ETFs last month and coincides with multiple pending applications for spot XRP funds from firms including WisdomTree, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton. While spot XRP ETFs remain under review, the appearance of leveraged products may offer a glimpse into the evolving attitude of regulators toward altcoin-based investment vehicles. XRP was trading at $1.91 at press time, up roughly 5% over the previous 24 hours.

A low was formed at $0.5106 and the price started a recovery wave. There was a move above the $0.540 and $0.5550 levels. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.6712 swing high to the $0.5106 low. Cardano price is now trading below $0.620 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.60 zone. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.60 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The first resistance is near $0.610 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.6712 swing high to the $0.5106 low. The next key resistance might be $0.6320. If there is a close above the $0.6320 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.680 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.70 in the near term. Another Drop in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.60 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.5680 level. The next major support is near the $0.5550 level. A downside break below the $0.5550 level could open the doors for a test of $0.5320. The next major support is near the $0.50 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for ADA/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.5680 and $0.5550. Major Resistance Levels – $0.6000 and $0.6100.",ADA|adabtc|adausd|ADAUSDT|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-04-08 05:08:32

As Ripple inches closer to the end of its legal battle with the SEC , a brand-new investment vehicle is being rolled out in the US—one that could open the floodgates for wider XRP adoption. For the first time, a leveraged ETF tied to XRP is set to go live , giving traders a chance to amplify their exposure to the asset’s daily moves. Teucrium Launches First-Ever Leveraged XRP ETF in the US Teucrium Investment Advisors is set to debut a 2x leveraged XRP ETF—XXRP—on NYSE Arca starting April 8, offering traders more exposure to XRP’s daily moves even before a spot ETF gets the green light. It will trade on NYSE Arca under the ticker XXRP, aiming to deliver twice the daily return of XRP through swap agreements, a financial tool used to mirror XRP’s price movements. Moreover, the ETF will charge a 1.89% management fee and cater to traders seeking bigger short-term moves without holding the underlying asset directly. How Will It Work Without a US Spot XRP ETF? Since the US doesn’t yet have a spot XRP ETF available, the XXRP fund will reference European-listed XRP ETPs instead. These include offerings from 21Shares, Bitwise, WisdomTree, Virtune, and CoinShares. It will also rely on benchmarks such as the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate and the XRP-Dollar Real-Time Index. What’s unusual here is that this leveraged product is arriving ahead of any approved spot XRP ETFs, which is almost unheard of in traditional ETF rollouts. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas called it “ very odd ,” noting the high expectations for a spot XRP ETF, which remains pending approval from the SEC. Shortly, Teucrium is also planning a short version of the ETF, which would let investors potentially profit from daily price declines in XRP. Investor Demand and Ripple’s Legal Win Drive the Launch According to Teucrium CEO Sal Gilbertie, now is the perfect time to launch this product due to XRP’s relatively low price and growing investor interest. Teucrium already manages $311 million and is known for niche ETFs, including a Bitcoin futures ETF approved in 2022 . The ETF launch follows fresh optimism around Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently predicted that multiple XRP ETFs could arrive in the second half of 2025. ETF Optimism Grows as XRP Inches Higher After the SEC dropped its legal case with Ripple, confidence is soaring. The chances of XRP ETF approval have shot up to 86%, with the token gaining 14% in value. Big players like Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, and 21Shares are already in line with ETF filings and industry voices suggest even BlackRock and Fidelity might soon join the XRP ETF race. At press time, XRP trades around $1.87, down 3% on the day, but investor interest remains high as the ETF race heats up.",News|Crypto ETF,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-08 05:09:29
43063403,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147201,1744089008,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Exciting News: Trump-Linked WLFI Unveils USD1 Airdrop Test on Ethereum,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/wlfi-usd1-airdrop-ethereum-test/,"Get ready for a potential crypto windfall! World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi project with ties to former President Trump, is making waves with its latest proposal. They’re planning a test airdrop – and it’s not just any airdrop. WLFI is aiming to send USD1 in crypto to every single WLFI token holder. Yes, you read that right, free crypto! But what’s the real story behind this intriguing move? Let’s dive into the details of this WLFI airdrop and explore what it means for the crypto community. What is the Buzz About the WLFI USD1 Airdrop? The crypto sphere is constantly buzzing with new projects and innovative strategies. The proposed WLFI airdrop is designed to serve multiple purposes, all rolled into one neat, crypto-package: System Testing: First and foremost, this airdrop is a crucial test for WLFI’s airdrop distribution system. Think of it as a dry run before a major event. It allows them to identify and iron out any potential glitches in their infrastructure, ensuring smooth and efficient future distributions. USD1 Stablecoin Promotion: At the heart of WLFI’s ecosystem is their USD1 stablecoin . This airdrop is a strategic move to put this stablecoin directly into the hands of users. By distributing USD1, WLFI aims to increase awareness and adoption of their stablecoin within the crypto community. It’s a clever way to get people familiar with and potentially start using their stablecoin for transactions or within the WLFI ecosystem. Rewarding Early Supporters: Loyalty in the crypto world is highly valued. This airdrop is a thank you note to the early believers and holders of WLFI tokens. It’s a way to show appreciation and strengthen the bond with their community. Rewarding early adopters can also foster a sense of belonging and encourage continued support for the project. Why Ethereum for the Airdrop? WLFI has chosen the Ethereum blockchain for this airdrop, which is a significant decision. Ethereum , being the second-largest cryptocurrency and a powerhouse for decentralized applications (dApps), offers several advantages: Robust Infrastructure: Ethereum boasts a mature and robust blockchain infrastructure, capable of handling a large number of transactions. This is crucial for an airdrop that aims to reach all WLFI holders. Widespread Adoption: Ethereum’s ecosystem is vast and widely adopted within the crypto community. Distributing the airdrop on Ethereum ensures accessibility for a large segment of crypto users who are already familiar with the network and its tools. DeFi Compatibility: As a DeFi project, WLFI naturally aligns with Ethereum, which is the leading platform for decentralized finance. Leveraging Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem can facilitate easier integration and utility for the USD1 stablecoin and WLFI tokens within the broader DeFi space. However, it’s important to note that conducting an airdrop on Ethereum also comes with considerations like transaction fees (gas fees). WLFI will need to carefully manage these costs to ensure the airdrop remains economically viable. Governance Vote and Eligibility Criteria: What’s Next? Before the WLFI airdrop becomes a reality, there are still a few crucial steps to navigate: Governance Vote: The proposal is currently pending a governance vote. This means that the WLFI community, likely through token holders, will have a say in whether or not this airdrop proceeds. Governance votes are a cornerstone of decentralized projects, ensuring community involvement in key decisions. Final Eligibility Criteria: WLFI will need to establish and announce the final eligibility criteria for the airdrop. This will define who exactly qualifies to receive the USD1. Criteria could include holding a minimum amount of WLFI tokens, holding them for a certain period, or participating in specific community activities. Clear and transparent eligibility rules are essential for a fair and successful airdrop. Once these steps are completed, and if the governance vote is in favor, the Ethereum airdrop will be set in motion. Keep an eye on official WLFI channels for updates on the governance vote outcome and the announcement of eligibility criteria. Benefits of the WLFI USD1 Airdrop This proposed airdrop holds potential benefits for various stakeholders: Stakeholder Benefit WLFI Project Tests airdrop system, promotes USD1 stablecoin, increases community engagement, gathers user feedback. WLFI Holders Receives free crypto (USD1), potential increase in WLFI token value if the airdrop is successful and drives adoption, rewarded for loyalty. Crypto Community Observes a real-world test case of a crypto airdrop, gains insights into stablecoin promotion strategies, potential for wider adoption of DeFi projects linked to notable figures. Challenges and Considerations While the WLFI airdrop presents exciting possibilities, there are also challenges and considerations to keep in mind: Airdrop Costs: Even a USD1 airdrop to a large number of holders can accumulate significant costs, especially considering Ethereum gas fees. WLFI needs to ensure the overall benefits outweigh these expenses. Regulatory Scrutiny: Projects linked to prominent figures, like former President Trump, often attract heightened regulatory attention. WLFI needs to ensure compliance with all relevant regulations regarding airdrops and stablecoin distribution. User Experience: The airdrop process needs to be user-friendly and seamless. Any complexities or difficulties in claiming the airdrop could lead to negative user experiences and hinder the intended promotional goals. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts What can you take away from this WLFI airdrop proposal? Stay Informed: Keep track of the WLFI governance vote and the announcement of eligibility criteria. If you are a WLFI holder, you’ll want to know if and how you can claim your USD1. Observe and Learn: This airdrop is a valuable case study in crypto project marketing and community engagement. Observe how WLFI executes this airdrop and the resulting impact on their ecosystem and the USD1 stablecoin . Explore DeFi Projects: The WLFI project and this airdrop highlight the innovative nature of DeFi. Explore other DeFi projects and learn about the diverse ways they are leveraging blockchain technology and tokenomics. Conclusion: A Glimpse into Crypto’s Innovative Future? The Trump-linked WLFI’s proposed USD1 airdrop is more than just a small crypto giveaway. It’s a strategic move designed to test infrastructure, promote a stablecoin, and reward a community. Whether it’s a stroke of genius or a minor experiment, it’s undoubtedly capturing attention and sparking conversations within the crypto world. As we await the governance vote and further details, this event serves as a reminder of the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of cryptocurrency and the creative strategies projects employ to grow and engage their communities. The outcome of this Ethereum airdrop could provide valuable insights into the future of crypto promotions and community building.

The firm points to data from the past two years showing the emergence of “Micro Altcoin Seasons,” short periods where certain altcoins outperform Bitcoin. This stands in stark contrast to the 2017-2022 cycle, when altcoins generally rose en masse, significantly reducing Bitcoin’s dominance. “The 90-day change in Bitcoin Dominance suggests that we have experienced several Micro Alt Seasons since 2023, a trend unlike anything we have seen before,” Alphractal said. Bitcoin Dominance currently stands at over 63%, and when stablecoins like USDT and USDC are included, the total dominance rises to 72.52%. Alphractal says this figure underscores how different the current market structure is compared to past cycles. Related News: Tariff Confusion: Will They Really Be Suspended for 90 Days? US President Donald Trump Sets the Final Word However, the firm notes that there is a silver lining for altcoin investors: As Bitcoin dominance increases, the risk-reward ratio for altcoins generally becomes more attractive. According to the Altcoin Seasonality Index, some altcoins have recently fallen less than Bitcoin, suggesting that accumulation may already be underway. “We may not see these low prices again for certain altcoins,” the report says, pointing to potential upside if market sentiment changes. Still, the outlook is not universally bullish. Popular tokens that saw strong gains in early 2024, such as SOL, XRP, AAVE, and BNB, could face another downturn if Bitcoin continues to fall, according to the analytics firm. Alphractal also notes that many lesser-known altcoins remain close to their launch or bear market prices, fueling skepticism around another altcoin rally. However, they caution investors not to dismiss the possibility, noting that altcoin seasons can occur in both bull and bear markets, especially when supported by the right metrics. *This is not investment advice.

Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) has surged a whopping 30% over the past 24 hours, topping $0.60 on April 8, according to CoinGecko. On April 7, the Solana-based memecoin hit a low of $0.42 amid the broader crypto market slump, which saw Bitcoin ( BTC ) prices fall below $75,000 to a five-month low. However, since then the token has gained more than 40% and is one of the crypto market’s top performers at the moment. Crypto trader “RookieXBT” told their 484,000 followers that Fartcoin volume was increasing “while the world falls apart,” adding, “No other coin is doing this.” The financial parody account “Not Jerome Powell” quipped , “hot air rises,” noting that every asset was down aside from Fartcoin. Stock markets across the globe slumped on April 7 in reaction to Donald Trump’s sweeping trade tariffs. S&P 500 tanked almost 10% over the past week. Source: Google Finance The Fartcoin token, which launched in October with no utility, has defied the markets several times before by bouncing upward when other assets have tanked. Bitcoin dumped 6% on April 3 in a fall from above $87,000 to around $81,500. Fartcoin was one of the first to recover, surging 36% the following day. Additionally, the token saw its market capitalization top $1 billion in December during a wider slump for altcoins. Goldbug Peter Schiff responds to Fartcoin prices.

Crypto analysts anticipate that the yuan's depreciation could favor bitcoin (BTC), drawing parallels to similar events from a decade ago. Early Tuesday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the so-called daily yuan fix at 7.2038 per dollar on Tuesday, the weakest since September. The yuan isn't a free float currency like the USD, euro and other G-7 nations and is allowed to trade in a range of 2% on either side of the daily fix announced at 9:15 a.m. Beijing time. The 7.2 level has been considered a ""harder line in the sand"" for the central bank for years. The USD/CNY pair has traded above the said level a few times since 2022 but never established a foothold. That could change with the PBOC explicitly setting the daily mid-point beyond the 7.2 level. In other words, the move signals a shift to managed depreciation of the yuan, which will help keep China's exports cheaper and competitive, potentially offsetting the negative impact of Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods. Capital flight to BTC? The managed depreciation could also trigger capital flight from China, which may find home in cryptocurrencies, according to analysts. ""The U.S. is now pursuing full-scale economic pressure on China, which may be forced to respond with quantitative easing and a currency devaluation. If so—and if China permits capital flight—Bitcoin could surge, much like it did in 2015,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research , said in a note to clients Monday. The Chinese central bank devalued the yuan by 1.9% on Aug. 11, 2015, the most significant single-day depreciation in over two decades, sending shockwaves across global financial markets. Bitcoin initially fell over 20% with the U.S. stocks but quickly turned higher and surged nearly 60% in the following four months. Ben Zhou, CEO and founder of the crypto exchange Bybit, voiced a similar opinion on X, saying yuan depreciation tends to bode well for bitcoin. ""China will try to lower RMB to counter the tariff, historically, whenever RMB drops, a lot of Chinese capital flow into BTC, bullish for BTC,"" Zhou said on X. Regulatory hurdles While history tells us to expect a bullish BTC reaction to yuan depreciation, note that over the years, China has become anti-crypto, citing financial stability risks and has some of the world's harshest regulations. A new regulation announced earlier this year requires banks to monitor and report suspicious international transactions, including those involving cryptocurrency. Banks are obligated to investigate and report any risky crypto trades, which may result in financial restrictions and potential blacklisting for the trader. The stringent stance means local traders may have a tough time diversifying into bitcoin and other digital assets in the event of a sustained yuan depreciation. ""Since August 2024, the Supreme People’s Court has significantly increased the legal risks for individuals using cryptocurrencies in connection with money laundering, which could easily extend to cases of capital flight,"" Thielen said. ""This presents a major deterrent, despite rising economic uncertainty.""",Markets|China|Yuan|Markets,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-08 05:19:04

XRP has gained more than 6% in the last 24 hours and is trading at $1.90 at the time of writing. According to experts, XRP is trapped within a descending parallel channel, hinting at a short-term bearish trend. The critical support here is around $1.75, with resistance at approximately $2.66. Additionally, the centerline of this channel, acting as a short-term resistance, sits near $2.15. Recently, XRP broke below the short-term support range of $1.95 to $2.05. As of now, it’s retesting this area, which could potentially act as new resistance. A confirmed breakout above $2.05 could lead to resistance at $2.15, with further hurdles around $2.24 to $2.30. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP ETF News: Teucrium Debuts XXRP Leveraged ETF Before Spot ETF Approval , Current Market Conditions and Patterns Currently, XRP is in a corrective phase, moving in an ABC structure. There’s a cluster of support around $1.55 to $1.57, which might offer a temporary bounce. However, the overall trend remains down unless XRP can decisively break above $2.17. If it fails to do so, we can expect further declines towards $1.55, possibly even testing the $1.33 to $1.21 range. Weekly Perspective: Fibonacci Support Levels XRP has bounced from the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level, providing support near $1.60. This level is crucial—if XRP drops below this, the next support could be around $1.30 to $1.40. The resistance levels to watch are near $2 and a strong barrier at around $3. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

43063752,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147205,1744089658,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Tactics: Google Allegedly Pays AI Staff Millions to Do Nothing Amid AI Talent War,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/google-ai-staff-non-compete-tactics/,"In the fast-paced world of artificial intelligence, where innovation is currency and talent is king, a shocking revelation has emerged from the heart of Silicon Valley. Tech giant Google, a name synonymous with AI advancement, is allegedly employing an unusual tactic to retain its top Google AI staff . Instead of fostering a stimulating environment, reports suggest Google is paying some of its prized AI researchers to do absolutely nothing for up to a year, all in the name of preventing them from joining rival companies. Is this a desperate move in the escalating AI talent war , or a questionable strategy that could backfire? The Alleged Google Tactic: Paid Inactivity for AI Staff According to a Business Insider report, Google’s AI division, DeepMind, based in London, is resorting to what are described as “aggressive” non-compete agreements . These agreements are not just standard clauses; they reportedly bar some Google AI staff from working for competitors for an extended period – up to a year. But here’s the twist: Google is allegedly paying these employees their salaries during this enforced hiatus. Imagine being paid your full salary to essentially sit on the sidelines. Sounds like a dream for some, but for ambitious AI researchers eager to contribute to the rapidly evolving field, it might feel more like a gilded cage. Here’s a breakdown of what’s reportedly happening: Aggressive Non-Competes: DeepMind in the UK is using stringent non-compete agreements . Paid Time Off… Sort Of: Affected Google AI staff are paid during the non-compete period, which can last up to a year. Talent Retention Strategy: This is seen as a measure to prevent talent from migrating to competitors like OpenAI and Microsoft. Researcher Frustration: Reports indicate that this practice can lead to frustration among researchers who feel disconnected from the rapid advancements in AI research . Why the Aggressive Non-Compete Approach? The context here is the fiercely competitive landscape of AI research and development. Companies like Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, and others are locked in a relentless battle for AI supremacy. Top Google AI staff , especially those at the cutting edge of innovation, are incredibly valuable assets. Losing them to a rival could mean handing over a competitive advantage. In this light, Google’s alleged strategy, while unconventional, can be seen as a drastic measure to protect its intellectual property and maintain its lead in the AI talent war . Consider these factors driving this aggressive approach: Intense Competition: The AI talent war is at its peak. Companies are vying for the best minds in the field. Value of Expertise: Experienced Google AI staff possess invaluable knowledge and skills that are hard to replace. Fear of Knowledge Transfer: Companies are wary of their proprietary AI research and breakthroughs being shared with competitors. Strategic Advantage: Retaining top talent is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving AI industry. The Downside: Stifling Innovation and Researcher Morale While Google’s motive might be understandable from a business perspective, the alleged practice raises serious questions about its impact on innovation and the morale of its Google AI staff . For researchers passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI research , being sidelined for a year, even with pay, can be incredibly demotivating. The field of AI is moving at lightning speed, and a year of inactivity could mean falling behind on crucial developments and losing valuable momentum. Nando de Freitas, VP of AI at Microsoft, even highlighted this issue in a post on X (formerly Twitter), stating that DeepMind staff are reaching out to him “in despair” seeking ways to escape their non-compete agreements . This paints a picture of talented individuals feeling trapped and frustrated, yearning to contribute actively to the AI research community. Here are potential negative consequences: Researcher Frustration: Being paid to do nothing can lead to boredom, stagnation, and a feeling of being undervalued. Skill Decay: A year away from active AI research could lead to a decline in skills and knowledge. Brain Drain (Potentially Later): While intended to retain talent now, this strategy could backfire in the long run if researchers become disillusioned and seek opportunities elsewhere after the non-compete period ends. Slower Innovation: If top minds are kept out of the active AI research loop, it could potentially slow down the pace of overall innovation in the field. Non-Competes: A Legal Minefield Across Continents The legality and enforceability of non-compete agreements vary significantly across different regions. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) banned most non-compete agreements last year, recognizing their potential to stifle competition and worker mobility. However, this ban does not extend to DeepMind’s London headquarters, where UK laws may permit more extensive use of such agreements. This creates an interesting dynamic. While US-based tech companies might face legal hurdles in enforcing broad non-compete agreements , their UK counterparts, like DeepMind, may have more leeway. This difference in legal frameworks adds another layer of complexity to the AI talent war and the strategies companies employ to secure and retain their top Google AI staff and other valuable employees. Consider this comparison: Region Non-Compete Agreement Legality Implications for AI Talent United States Largely banned by FTC (with some exceptions) Less restrictive for AI staff , greater mobility, potentially fosters competition. United Kingdom More enforceable, but subject to reasonableness and time limits Companies like DeepMind may have more power to restrict employee movement, potentially hindering individual career growth but securing company IP in the short term. Is This a Sustainable Strategy in the AI Talent War? Google’s alleged tactic of paying Google AI staff to do nothing might be a short-term fix to prevent talent from jumping ship in the heat of the AI talent war . However, its long-term sustainability and ethical implications are questionable. In the long run, fostering a stimulating and rewarding work environment, where researchers feel valued, challenged, and part of a groundbreaking mission, is likely to be a more effective and ethical strategy for attracting and retaining top AI research talent. While non-compete agreements can play a role in protecting company interests, relying on paid inactivity as a primary tool in the AI talent war seems like a drastic and potentially counterproductive measure. The AI industry thrives on innovation and collaboration. Strategies that stifle researcher enthusiasm and create a sense of stagnation could ultimately harm not just individual careers but also the overall progress of AI research . In conclusion, the reports surrounding Google’s alleged use of paid inactivity periods for Google AI staff highlight the extreme lengths companies are willing to go to in the fiercely competitive AI talent war . While the legality of non-compete agreements remains a complex issue, particularly across different jurisdictions, the ethical and long-term implications of such tactics deserve careful consideration. The future of AI innovation depends on nurturing, not stifling, the passion and drive of the brilliant minds that power this transformative technology.

While Metaplanet has reinforced its long-term Bitcoin strategy by repaying $13.5 million in bonds ahead of schedule, corporate treasuries globally have seen over $4 billion in value erased from their Bitcoin holdings as market volatility takes its toll. Corporate Bitcoin Treasuries Suffer $4B Blow Amid Trump Tariffs, Raising Doubts on BTC as a Treasury Asset Corporate treasuries holding Bitcoin have seen their portfolios take a staggering hit, shedding more than $4 billion in value following US President Donald Trump’s sweeping new tariffs on foreign imports. The aggressive economic move, announced on April 2, triggered a global market sell-off — and Bitcoin-linked corporate portfolios weren’t spared, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. Corporate Bitcoin holdings (Source: BitcoinTreasuries) As of April 7, the total value of corporate-held Bitcoin stands at roughly $54.5 billion, a sharp decline from the approximately $59 billion valuation just days prior. The plunge reflects not only the broader market panic sparked by protectionist policy but also renewed questions about the role of Bitcoin as a reliable asset within corporate treasuries. Collateral Damage: Publicly Traded BTC Holders Feel the Burn The tariff announcement sent shockwaves through both traditional and crypto markets, but companies with exposure to Bitcoin have been especially hard hit. The Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF (OWNB) — an exchange-traded fund tracking a diversified portfolio of corporate Bitcoin holders — has plunged over 13% since the tariffs were unveiled. Even Strategy, the firm founded by Bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor and often viewed as the poster child for corporate Bitcoin adoption, has not escaped the downturn. Shares of Strategy have mirrored OWNB’s slide, also falling more than 13%, per data from Google Finance. The losses are not isolated to a few firms. They represent a broader risk associated with holding a highly volatile, decentralized digital asset in environments where traditional economic shocks — like tariffs — can ripple unpredictably through markets. The decline has reignited a long-standing debate about whether Bitcoin truly belongs in corporate treasuries. Historically, these coffers have been filled with ultra-low-risk assets like US Treasury bills, intended to preserve capital and ensure liquidity. Bitcoin, by contrast, is known for its dramatic price swings and regulatory uncertainty. “Cryptocurrencies' high volatility and uncertain regulatory landscape are misaligned with the fundamental goals of treasury management — namely stability, liquidity, and capital preservation,” noted David Krause, a finance professor at Marquette University, in a January research paper. These concerns are echoed across financial circles. Despite 2024’s bull run — which saw shares of Strategy surge over 350%, according to FinanceCharts — the recent selloff shows just how precarious this strategy can be. GameStop's Bitcoin Pivot Sparks Investor Anxiety One of the most notable cautionary tales is GameStop. In March, the struggling retailer saw its market capitalization drop by nearly $3 billion after it revealed intentions to convert a sizable portion of its reserves into Bitcoin . The plan, intended to emulate Strategy’s crypto-fueled success, was met with widespread skepticism. “There are question marks with GameStop's model. If Bitcoin is going to be the pivot, where does that leave everything else?” said Bret Kenwell, a US investment analyst at eToro, in a March 27 interview with Reuters . The message from markets appears clear: corporate Bitcoin adoption is no longer an automatic ticket to shareholder enthusiasm. Despite growing criticism, some remain steadfast in their belief that Bitcoin offers strategic value in an increasingly unstable world. Fidelity Digital Assets argues that Bitcoin may serve as a long-term hedge against rising fiscal deficits, currency debasement, and geopolitical risks — the very type of risks underscored by Trump’s trade maneuvers. “Bitcoin has the potential to be a valuable treasury asset precisely because it is non-sovereign and resistant to centralized control,” Fidelity said in a 2024 report . That theory is being put to the test in real time. According to Binance’s April 7 market analysis, Bitcoin showed “signs of resilience” in the days following the tariff announcement — even as stocks and other risk assets crumbled. “In the wake of recent tariff announcements, BTC has shown some signs of resilience, holding steady or rebounding on days when traditional risk assets faltered,” the Binance report noted. The Verdict: A Crossroads for Corporate Crypto Strategy The fallout from the Trump tariffs has delivered a harsh reality check to firms betting big on Bitcoin. While digital assets may provide unique advantages in certain macroeconomic climates, their place in corporate finance remains contentious — particularly in an era of heightened global uncertainty. Investors and corporate leaders alike are now watching closely to see if Bitcoin can retain its appeal as a non-sovereign, permissionless asset in a world that appears to be retreating into economic nationalism. As market volatility continues and the geopolitical landscape shifts, the future of Bitcoin in corporate treasuries remains a high-stakes gamble — one that could either redefine modern treasury strategy or serve as a cautionary tale for years to come. Metaplanet Repays $13.5M in Bonds Early Amid Aggressive Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy In related news, Metaplanet, the Japanese hotel operator-turned-Bitcoin acquisition company, has repaid 2 billion yen ($13.5 million) worth of corporate bonds ahead of schedule. The repayment, announced on April 7, reinforces the firm’s strong liquidity position even as global markets face heightened volatility. According to the company’s statement, the early redemption of its 9th Series of Ordinary Bonds was completed on April 4, more than five months ahead of maturity. The zero-interest bonds, originally issued in March through Metaplanet’s in-house Evo Fund, were primarily used to fund additional Bitcoin purchases. While the repayment won’t materially impact Metaplanet’s fiscal 2025 results due to the bonds’ zero-interest structure, the move signals fiscal discipline and strategic intent as the company deepens its identity as a Bitcoin treasury-focused firm. Bitcoin at the Core of Metaplanet’s Strategy Once a relatively obscure player in the Japanese hospitality industry, Metaplanet has become one of the most closely watched Bitcoin adopters in Asia. Following a dramatic pivot in 2023, the company now trades publicly on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and has rapidly accumulated 4,206 BTC. Top 10 largest bitcoin holders (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.net) This puts Metaplanet among the top 10 publicly traded Bitcoin holders globally, surpassing several US and European firms that have only cautiously dipped into digital assets. In January 2024, Metaplanet unveiled an ambitious plan to purchase up to 21,000 BTC — roughly 1% of the total supply that will ever exist — by the end of 2026. To support the plan, the company aims to raise over $700 million through a combination of bond issuance, internal reserves, and equity financing. Despite Bitcoin’s recent turbulence, Metaplanet’s leadership has not wavered. On social media over the weekend, CEO Simon Gerovich reaffirmed the company’s unwavering stance on Bitcoin’s role in its financial roadmap. The comment came just as Bitcoin’s price briefly fell below $80,000 on April 7 in response to a global market sell-off. The panic was triggered by US President Trump’s ”Liberation Day” tariff announcement, which rattled investors across asset classes. Bitcoin’s dip mirrored steep declines in US equities, with the S&P 500 Index losing $5 trillion in market capitalization over two trading sessions. Yet, unlike many investors seeking safety, Metaplanet appears poised to leverage the downturn to buy more BTC at discounted prices. A 4,800% Share Price Surge and Rising Global Influence Metaplanet’s aggressive strategy hasn’t gone unnoticed. In the span of a year, its stock has risen a staggering 4,800%, according to Tokyo market data. While some investors see this meteoric rise as speculative, others interpret it as a reflection of growing institutional belief in Bitcoin and a shift in how corporate balance sheets can be structured in the digital age. The company’s financial architecture now mirrors that of early Bitcoin adopters like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), with a strong focus on accumulating and holding BTC as a strategic reserve asset. However, Metaplanet’s success is not without risk. As global markets enter a new period of protectionism and economic fragmentation, volatility in risk assets — including Bitcoin — is expected to increase. Trump’s tariffs, designed to reduce US dependence on foreign goods, may exacerbate inflationary pressures and further destabilize cross-border trade. In this climate, Bitcoin’s role as a non-sovereign hedge is both tested and validated. While short-term volatility may scare off traditional treasury managers, firms like Metaplanet are betting that Bitcoin’s finite supply, decentralized architecture, and growing institutional adoption will drive long-term returns.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-08 05:30:00

The fund, called the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF, will begin trading on NYSE Arca under the ticker XXRP on Tuesday, Apr. 8, as reported by Bloomberg. The fund is designed to deliver twice the daily return of XRP ( XRP ) by using swap agreements. For example, the ETF will increase by 2% if XRP increases by 1% and lose twice as much if XRP declines. It will charge a management fee of 1.89%, as per the company’s prospectus , and is intended for short-term, active investors who have a strong view of XRP’s daily price movements. Teucrium will use several indices and ETPs, such as the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate and a basket of XRP ETPs listed in Europe, such as those from 21Shares, Bitwise, WisdomTree, and CoinShares, to determine the swaps’ prices. These foreign products will act as initial benchmarks because there are currently no spot XRP ETFs trading in the United States.

With the SEC’s regulatory clarity, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has shown increasing confidence in XRP ETFs. In a Mar. 19 interview with Bloomberg, shortly after the regulatory win, he predicted that spot XRP ETFs could launch in the second half of 2025.

The company said this reorganization is a necessary step toward aligning with US regulatory and investor expectations. Founded by Novogratz, a former hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group, Galaxy Digital offers a range of services including trading, asset management and venture investments focused on digital assets. The firm has been pursuing a US listing for years but faced delays under a stricter regulatory climate. Rising Volatility and Tariffs Weigh on IPO Market Despite Renewed Interest The Biden administration’s cautious approach to the crypto industry made US listings difficult for digital asset companies. However, since President Donald Trump returned to office, several firms have begun reviving or accelerating their public listing plans. These include well-known names such as Circle , Kraken , Gemini , Ripple and Bullish. Still, recent market volatility tied to Trump’s new tariffs has cast a shadow over IPO activity. Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” the Cboe Volatility Index, has jumped to its highest level since August 2024. The rise shows growing investor concern and has led companies like StubHub, Klarna and eToro to delay their IPO plans due to worries about lower valuations and shaky markets. Galaxy, however, appears ready to move forward. It will retain its listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange while expanding its footprint to Nasdaq, a step the firm sees as critical to gaining wider access to institutional investors in the US market.

The bank, along with other institutional giants, also backed more policy rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in response to the economic downturn. Several analysts expect Bitcoin’s (BTC) price to climb after a dip below $80k. Fed Rate Cuts To Boost BTC Price According to the Goldman Sachs forecast, the Feds will lower interest rates by 25 basis points in each meeting three times. This aligns with similar sentiments on Wall Street, which also calls for lower rates. Wells Fargo Investment Institute and JP Morgan raised expected rate cuts to three. JPMorgan has previously tipped two cuts, with policy rates falling to 4.25%. Overall, most firms gauged 116 basis point cuts, highlighting a reduction in at least four of five Fed meetings. This projection is a major positive for the crypto market, as fund flows to risky assets are expected. On the other hand, rate hikes see investors move funds out of these assets, with the Feds seeking to lower inflation. Several interest rate cuts will fuel a market recovery coupled with signs of growing institutional demand. Recent events like the approval of spot crypto ETFs have heightened tradfi participation. A move to lower rates now will see Wall Street gravitate towards the market. This scenario occurred in 2024 following global policy rate cuts after central banks posted cooling inflation. It should be noted that the heated macro continues its correlation with crypto prices. Bitcoin trades at $79,688 at press time, plummeting over 6% in the last 24 hours. The wider market also fell over 5%, lowering the market cap to $2.47 trillion. Bitcoin bulls currently set their sights on an institutional-driven rally to $90k. Is A United States Recession Imminent? President Trump’s sweeping tariffs have impacted global trade, negatively affecting U.S. stocks. This low confidence triggered massive outflows, with investors taking huge losses. Following recent economic woes, Goldman Sachs raised the odds on the possibility of a U.S. recession to 45%. This marks the second raise in a week as economists project the effect of the tariffs. Last week, the bank raised its recession estimate from 20% to 35%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan places the odds at 60%, citing inflation and other factors as effects of the widespread tariffs. This comes as firms lower their U.S. economic growth forecast for 2025.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-08 05:48:37

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent added that nearly 70 countries have contacted the White House seeking tariff negotiations. However, this positive momentum was countered by Trump's refusal to suspend tariffs and his threat of additional measures against Chinese imports. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 5.68% to around 33,000 while the broader Topix Index gained 3.5% to 2,370 on Tuesday, recouping losses from the previous session. The Japanese yen climbed toward 147 per dollar on Tuesday, reversing losses from the previous, session, and tracked a global rise in yields driven by shifting sentiment on the economic outlook. In the latest developments, US President Trump has agreed to meet with Japanese officials to initiate trade talks, with Japan expected to be given priority in upcoming US tariff negotiations. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent believes Japan's swift engagement could expedite the negotiations. On the domestic front, Japan’s current account surplus jumped to a record high in February, as exports surged and imports declined—adding further weight to bond market moves and investor sentiment. The gauge for Japan’s service sector sharply declined to 45.1 in March 2025 from 45.6 in the previous month, marking the lowest level since August 2022, marking its third consecutive month of decline and the lowest level since July 2022. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.55% to around 3,115 and the Shenzhen Component climbing 0.45% to 9,400, as markets recovered some ground from the previous session despite intensifying trade tensions with the U.S. , and the offshore yuan held its recent decline around 7.35 per dollar, hovering near its lowest level in two months, weighed down by escalating US-China trade tensions. On Monday, President Trump threatened to slap an additional 50% tariff on Chinese goods starting Wednesday, building on top of existing duties totaling 54%. In response, China pledged further retaliation, warning it would ""fight to the end"" to defend its interests. Chinese state-owned holding firms and listed companies have announced share buybacks and investment pledges amid rising U.S. tariff pressure. Chengtong Holdings and Guoxin pledge to increase stakes in stocks and ETFs, with Guoxin pledging CNY 80 billion. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 0.91% to 20,304 in Tuesday morning trade, attempting to recover from a historic 13.2% plunge in the previous session—the steepest one-day loss since 2008. India ( SENSEX ) rose 1.08% to 73,877 in morning trade, halting losses from the previous three sessions. Sectors, led by consumer durables, moved into the green, following its steepest single-day fall in 10 months. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 1.89% to above 7,420 on Tuesday, recouping some losses from the previous session amid hopes that major trading partners could reach a deal with the US on tariffs. The Australian dollar climbed back above $0.60 on Tuesday after a sharp two-day decline. Australia’s NAB business confidence index edged down to -3 in March 2025 from a revised -2 in the previous month, marking the lowest level since last November. Australia's Westpac-Melbourne Institute Consumer Sentiment Index fell by 6.0% mom to a six-month low of 90.1 in April 2025.

Nigeria Demands $81B for Unpaid Taxes and Damages The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) is demanding $2 billion in unpaid taxes and $79.5 billion in damages, claiming Binance’s operations in Nigeria caused economic harm.The agency claims that Binance has a “significant economic presence” in the country and should have paid corporate taxes for 2022 and 2023, plus a 10% yearly penalty on overdue amounts. Binance’s court case in Nigeria has been delayed because the company argued that it wasn’t properly notified. Since Binance is based in the Cayman Islands and not physically in Nigeria, its lawyer said the tax authority needed special permission to send legal papers by email. The court has postponed the case to give Nigeria’s tax agency (FIRS) time to formally respond to Binance’s challenge. In the next hearing, FIRS is expected to defend its use of email to serve legal documents to the offshore exchange. Nigeria’s Crypto Crackdown Nigeria is cracking down on crypto platforms, accusing them of disrupting the country’s currency market. In 2024, two Binance executives were detained as part of an investigation into naira-based crypto trades. Authorities claim Binance and similar platforms hurt the official exchange rates and help money leave the country. In early 2024, the Central Bank claimed $26 billion in unknown user transactions went through Binance. Authorities demanded data on Binance’s top 100 users and their activity over six months. In response, Binance shut down its peer-to-peer (P2P) trading in Nigeria on February 20, citing system abuse and big currency swings. The government also blocked access to Binance’s website. A key court hearing on April 30 will address Binance’s legal pushback in its tax case. This growing clash highlights the struggle between fast-moving crypto innovation and strict financial regulation in countries like Nigeria.

Reuters reported on April 7 that a lawyer for Binance, Chukwuka Ikwuazom, asked a court the same day to invalidate an order allowing for court documents to be served to the company via email. Binance doesn't have an office in Nigeria and Ikwuazom claimed the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) didn’t get court permission to serve court documents to Binance outside the country. ""On the whole the order for the substituted service as granted by the court on February 11, 2025 on Binance who is ... registered under the laws of Cayman Islands and resident in Cayman Islands is improper and should be set aside,"" he said. FIRS sued Binance in February, claiming the exchange owed $2 billion in back taxes and should be made to pay $79.5 billion for damages to the local economy as its its operations allegedly destabilized the country’s currency, the naira, which Binance denies. It also reportedly alleged that Binance is liable to pay corporate income tax in Nigeria, as it has a “significant economic presence” there, with FIRS requesting a court order for the exchange to pay income taxes for 2022 and 2023, plus a 10% annual penalty on unpaid amounts along with a nearly a 27% interest rate on the unpaid taxes. Nigeria’s legal history with Binance In February 2024, Nigeria arrested and detained Binance executives Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla on tax fraud and money laundering charges.

Hayes said that if the Chinese central bank devalued its currency, the yuan, the “narrative [is] that Chinese capital flight will flow into Bitcoin,” adding that “it worked in 2013, 2015, and can work in 2025.” Bybit co-founder and CEO Ben Zhou said that China will try to lower the yuan to counter the tariff, adding that historically, whenever the yuan drops, “a lot of Chinese capital flows into BTC,” which is bullish for Bitcoin ( BTC ). The yuan has weakened against the greenback since 2022. Source. Google Finance China devalued the yuan by nearly 2% against the US dollar, which saw the largest single-day drop in decades in August 2015. Bitcoin did see some increased interest during this period, though the direct causative relationship is debated. When the yuan fell below the symbolic 7:1 ratio against the USD in August 2019, Bitcoin also saw price increases in the same timeframe. Some analysts suggested that Chinese investors were using Bitcoin as a hedge as the asset jumped 20% in the first week of that month. In 2019, crypto asset manager Grayscale noted the depreciation in the Chinese yuan at attributed it as a factor that spurred Bitcoin markets at the time. Currency control avoidance and wealth preservation Wealthy Chinese citizens may have used crypto in the past to preserve their wealth, move it beyond government reach, and avoid capital controls and restrictions within the country, according to analysts. It is also believed that currency devaluations also damage trust in central banks and government financial management, pushing people toward decentralized alternatives like Bitcoin.

The analyst looked into the short-term holder MVRV ratio, noting that they are at about 18% unrealized loss on average. This is equivalent to the levels at the bottom of the 2024 price action when Bitcoin dropped to $52,000. “Interestingly, this level of unrealized loss was also seen at the bottom of the bear market,” he observed before adding that the depths of the bear market were significantly worse as STH unrealized losses reached lows of 40%.

The lawsuit, filed in D.C. District Court, aims to force the agency to disclose information that could unmask one of the most mysterious figures in technology history. Murphy, commonly known as “MetaLawMan” on X, is using the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to force the DHS to release documents that could reveal who was behind the creation of Bitcoin. He is being assisted on the case by former Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Field, a FOIA litigation expert. Related News: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Issues Stark Warning Amid Fall At the heart of the case are statements allegedly made by DHS Special Agent Rana Saoud during an industry conference in 2019. According to the court filing, Saoud told attendees that the agency had located and interviewed a group of four individuals responsible for the creation of BTC. Saoud alleged that these individuals detailed their motivations and the inner workings of the cryptocurrency during meetings with DHS agents in California. Despite these claims, DHS has never publicly confirmed or released such information. Murphy argues that with Bitcoin now a trillion-dollar asset that impacts economies and attracts global investment, the public has a right to know who the cryptocurrency’s founder is. Murphy expressed hope that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, appointed as part of the Trump administration's efforts to increase transparency, would voluntarily release the information. *This is not investment advice.

Murphy argues that if true, this information could boost public trust in Bitcoin and promote wider adoption. The case coincides with other federal transparency efforts, including an executive order that mandates US agencies to report crypto holdings to the Treasury. Lawsuit Claims DHS May Know Who Created Bitcoin A new lawsuit that was filed by crypto lawyer James Murphy, also known as MetaLawMan, is seeking to compel the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to reveal whether it has information about the identity of Bitcoin's elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. The suit was filed under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and it centers on a statement made by DHS Special Agent Rana Saoud during an April 2019 presentation at the OffshoreAlert Conference in Miami. Saoud claimed that DHS agents interviewed four people that were involved in creating Bitcoin, suggesting a deeper government knowledge of Bitcoin's origins than previously known. This suggests that the US government has a much deeper knowledge of who Bitcoin’s creator may be than most people first thought. Murphy announced the lawsuit on April 7, and said he is simply asking for the notes, emails, or any other documents related to that alleged meeting. He believes that if the meeting really took place, there should be records with more details about its substance. In her 2019 speech, Saoud stated that DHS agents flew to California to speak with a person they believed helped create Bitcoin and discovered he was not alone—three others were allegedly involved. She explained the agents' goal was to understand how Bitcoin works and what the creators’ long-term vision was. Lawsuit filed against DHS (Source: James Murphy ) Murphy is open to the possibility that Saoud and her colleagues may have been mistaken, but believes it is still important to verify the claims. He is prepared to pursue the case until its conclusion to determine the truth. Brian Field, a former Assistant US Attorney with experience in FOIA litigation, supports the case. The FOIA exists to ensure transparency and accountability in government by granting public access to federal records. When asked whether he believes the DHS truly interviewed Satoshi, Murphy responded that it’s possible the agents met with code maintainers or imposters. However, he also pointed out that Saoud was a high-ranking official and likely had access to accurate information. Murphy argued that revealing whether the government actually possesses knowledge about Nakamoto could settle some very long standing questions and potentially boost public trust in Bitcoin. Murphy also acknowledged the concerns about privacy and the potential risks of disclosing Satoshi’s identity, and compared it to the well-known identities of other blockchain pioneers like Charles Hoskinson and Vitalik Buterin. He explained that he is not hiring private investigators but is instead using legal channels to request transparency from the government. He also pointed out that government agencies should not hold secrets from the public unless national security is at stake. Murphy has been involved in Bitcoin mining and investment since 2017, and believes increased transparency around Bitcoin’s origins could enhance adoption globally. He shared that audiences he speaks to often find it difficult to trust a financial system with an anonymous creator, especially when other projects have clear provenance. Murphy believes that identifying Satoshi is unlikely to impact Bitcoin negatively, as its code is open-source and changes require community consensus through the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process. His main intention is to either disprove Saoud’s claim or confirm it through proper legal channels. In his view, bringing this issue to light may remove one of the final mysteries surrounding Bitcoin and support its adoption, particularly in light of pro-Bitcoin initiatives like President Trump’s proposed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. HBO documentary cover This lawsuit now adds to a growing list of attempts to uncover Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity. Previous efforts, including an HBO documentary claiming that cypherpunk Peter Todd was the inventor of Bitcoin, have largely failed and was mostly met with skepticism. Other people like Nick Szabo, Adam Back, and Hal Finney have been repeatedly speculated upon, but each denied the connection. For now, the Bitcoin community is still divided on whether revealing Satoshi’s identity will really be beneficial or detrimental. US Agencies Ordered to Reveal Crypto Holdings Other US federal agencies are also under pressure to be more transparent as they are expected to disclose their cryptocurrency holdings to the Department of the Treasury by April 7, after an executive order was signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year. According to journalist Eleanor Terrett , the agencies have to report their crypto assets to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent by the deadline. These disclosures will stay confidential for now, and it is still unclear if or when the information will be made public. The reporting requirement stems from a March 7 executive order that started the formation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a broader Digital Asset Stockpile. The Bitcoin reserve will be seeded using BTC that was previously seized by federal agencies through civil or criminal proceedings. White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks described the reserve as a “digital Fort Knox,” assuring that the BTC stored in the reserve would not be sold but rather held as a store of value. Sacks previously criticized the US government’s decision to sell 195,000 BTC for just $366 million, and suggested that those assets could have been worth billions if they were never sold. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will initially be funded with BTC held by the Treasury. Other federal agencies are currently reviewing their legal authority to transfer their holdings to the centralized reserve. Meanwhile, the Digital Asset Stockpile is intended to encourage responsible management of government-held crypto under the oversight of the Treasury, potentially including controlled asset sales. On March 2, President Trump announced that the crypto reserve will include a variety of digital assets, and specifically named XRP, Solana, and Cardano. He later added Ethereum and Bitcoin to the list. This move was part of the major shift in US government crypto policy that signaled a much more structured and long-term approach to digital asset management. However, Trump’s most recent policy move rattled the markets. On April 5, the administration imposed a sweeping 10% tariff on all countries, with higher rates for specific nations like China, Japan, and the European Union. The global reaction was immediate and severe, with the overall cryptocurrency market shedding more than 8% of its capitalization and falling to $2.5 trillion. This unexpected shift from a pro-crypto stance to aggressive international trade policies introduced new volatility into both traditional and digital markets.

Dogecoin (DOGE), BNB Chain’s BNB, XRP and Cardano’s ADA rose as much as 10%, alleviating some of the past 24 hours' losses. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 ( CD20 ) added nearly 9%. Overall, crypto market cap has pulled back to levels seen in early November last year, when Donald Trump's victory triggered a rally that propelled the total value through a level that had been seen as offering resistance to further gains. Equity markets staged a bounce late Monday as rumors of an impending tariff respite caused the S&P 500 to soar over 7%, and then gave up nearly all those gains after the White House called the speculation “fake news.” Crypto-tracked futures amassed over $1.2 billion in liquidations on Monday as major cryptocurrencies slumped more than 20% at one point, setting the stage for a bounce as traders cut short positions and reversed overextended selling, as CoinDesk noted. Meanwhile, traders are eying bitcoin price action for cues on dip buying, with some saying they are cautious due to the uncertainty caused by the tariff wars. “We're optimistic that investors seeking safe havens may look to buy the dip on Bitcoin if it can show some relative strength against traditional assets during an eventual recovery period in the short term,” Jupiter Zheng, a partner at HashKey Capital, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “While global markets are experiencing record sell-offs, Bitcoin has also declined but remains relatively stable.” Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro's chief market analyst, said the market looked “emotionally oversold” and while a rebound was in place, the catalysts required for it to be a reversal were “not yet in place.” “Crypto market sentiment has returned to the extreme fear zone of 23, which is significantly higher than what we see in equities,” he said in an email. ""This does not mean that cryptocurrency investors are more confident about the future. Rather, it signals that the sell-off here is more organised, making it more dangerous.”",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-08 07:19:04

According to the graphic posted on the social media platform X, 70.33% of traders with open XRP futures are betting on a price increase, while only 29.67% are positioned short. This is reflected in a Long/Short Ratio of 2.37, indicating that for every short position, there are more than twice as many long positions. 70.33% of Binance traders with open $XRP futures positions are betting on a price increase! pic.twitter.com/pkoEmI3Ho4 — Ali (@ali_charts) April 6, 2025 The data is based on a 4-hour snapshot taken at 06:00 UTC on April 5, 2025. The visual representation shows a consistent trend over several previous 4-hour periods, with long positions maintaining a majority throughout. Although the percentage of long positions dipped slightly in earlier intervals, the overall trend appears to have rebounded toward increased optimism in the most recent data point. The chart, labeled under the account @ali_charts, further reinforces Ali’s commentary: “70.33% of Binance traders with open $XRP futures positions are betting on a price increase!” This suggests that sentiment among retail or institutional participants on Binance largely favors XRP appreciation in the near term. Trader Sentiment Leans Bullish Despite Recent Volatility A closer look at the chart shows a steady Long/Short Ratio above 2.0 in recent intervals, aligning with the dominance of long accounts in percentage terms. The ratio peaked at 2.37 as of the latest update, underscoring a sustained bullish bias among traders. These figures may suggest growing confidence or speculative momentum backing XRP at this stage of the market cycle. In response to the tweet, a user named Cygnet offered a more cautious interpretation, noting that such optimism could quickly reverse if negative price action resumes. Cygnet commented, “this means Hopeful market … but if they see another red day, this hope turns into SELLERs invasion … ‘too volatile’ would the following days be.” The user also revealed their current trading stance, stating, “Currently I’m on the 29.7% side,” indicating a short position aligned with the minority segment of traders. Implications of High Long/Short Ratios The disparity between long and short positioning can often serve as a sentiment indicator but is not always a reliable predictor of market direction. A high Long/Short Ratio can sometimes precede liquidation events if the price moves counter to the majority’s expectations. Conversely, it can also reflect strengthening bullish conviction if accompanied by supporting fundamentals or technical indicators. Market Reaction Will Determine Outcome At the time of the snapshot, no price data was shown directly on the chart, so it remains unclear whether these long positions are being opened in response to recent upward movement or in anticipation of a breakout. However, Ali’s focus on the percentage breakdown signals that sentiment, at least on Binance, is leaning strongly toward XRP gains. As of now, XRP market participants should consider both sentiment and market volatility when interpreting such metrics. While bullish positioning dominates, as shown in Ali’s analysis, the reaction to upcoming market developments will determine whether this optimism is well-founded or premature.

Besides, it also comes in tandem with the market expectations, anticipating a bounce back in Pi Coin’s price due to several factors. In addition, a top expert has revealed that the crypto is likely to hit $3 in the coming days, which has further fueled the investors’ optimism. Pi Network Price Soars: What Lies Ahead? Pi Network price jumped over 9% today and exchanged hands at $0.59, while its one-day volume fell 37% to $298.5 million. Notably, the crypto has hovered between $0.5375 and $0.6102 over the last 24 hours, reflecting the volatile scenario in the market. Meanwhile, this latest recovery indicates that the market participants are regaining their confidence in the asset. Besides, the low Pi Coin unlocks this week have further bolstered investors’ sentiment, which could have helped in the recent gains of the token. A Quick Tour Of Pi Network Unlock According to PiScan data , an average of 1.5 million Pi tokens will be unlocked through April 11. Over the next 30 days, the highest unlock will be on April 18 of around 9.8 million Pi, worth $5.7 million at the current price. Notably, the data also showed that a total of 160.74 million Pi tokens will get unlocked in the next 30 days, valued at around $93.77 million. Considering that, the experts have urged the Pi Core Team to burn tokens to offset concerns about this heavy inflow into the market. So, if the team manages to burn tokens or reveal any major announcement, it could trigger a strong rally in the asset’s price. Besides, the soaring adoption of Pi Network has further fueled investors’ confidence. What’s Next? Amid the ongoing recovery, a top expert said that Pi Coin price is expected to reach a new all-time high, sparking market optimism. For context, renowned crypto analyst MOON JEFF has forecasted that the Pi Network price will surge to $3 by June. This optimistic projection comes amid a tumultuous market, with PI’s value currently experiencing a downturn since February 27. Despite the bearish trend, MOON JEFF remains confident that PI will rebound and break through resistance levels once global trade tensions ease. According to the analyst, the Pi Network price’s potential is vast, with possibilities extending beyond current all-time highs. MOON JEFF’s prediction suggests a significant upside for PI, making it an attractive prospect for investors looking to capitalize on the cryptocurrency’s growth. However, this forecast contradicts a Pi price prediction , which indicates a bearish road ahead for the asset. Besides, a recent report also showed that some market experts anticipate Pi price to hit $0.3 if the bears continue to dominate. Having said that, investors should exercise due diligence while putting their bets into the market.

43067745,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147204,1744097145,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bold Move: Galaxy Digital’s Strategic US Redomicile Signals Nasdaq Listing,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/galaxy-digital-us-nasdaq-listing/,"In a move signaling growing confidence in the U.S. as a burgeoning hub for digital assets, Galaxy Digital, a leading financial services and investment management innovator in the crypto space, is set to redomicile to the United States. According to a recent announcement by Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto In America, the firm is shifting its base from the Cayman Islands to Delaware, a state increasingly recognized for its business-friendly environment. This strategic decision paves the way for Galaxy Digital’s highly anticipated listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange, marking a significant milestone for both the company and the broader cryptocurrency industry. Why the U.S. Redomicile? Navigating Crypto Regulation and Market Access The decision to redomicile in the U.S. is far from arbitrary. It reflects a calculated approach to align with the evolving crypto regulation landscape in America. Delaware, known for its robust corporate law and attractive business climate, offers a stable and predictable regulatory framework. This move signals Galaxy Digital’s commitment to operating within compliant and transparent structures, crucial for long-term growth and investor confidence. But what exactly are the driving forces behind this strategic shift? Evolving Regulatory Clarity: The U.S., while still developing comprehensive federal crypto laws, is showing increasing signs of regulatory maturity. States like Delaware are leading the charge in creating a welcoming environment for blockchain and digital asset businesses. Redomiciling to the U.S. positions Galaxy Digital to benefit from this growing clarity and potentially influence future regulatory developments. Enhanced Market Access: Being based in the U.S. and listing on Nasdaq provides Galaxy Digital with unparalleled access to the world’s largest capital markets and a vast pool of institutional investment . This move can significantly broaden their investor base, attracting both domestic and international investors seeking exposure to the burgeoning digital asset class. Strategic Alignment: The U.S. is increasingly becoming a focal point for crypto innovation and adoption. Redomiciling places Galaxy Digital at the heart of this ecosystem, enabling closer collaboration with U.S.-based partners, clients, and regulators. This strategic alignment is vital for staying ahead in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Nasdaq Listing: A Gateway to Institutional Investment and Mainstream Recognition The planned Nasdaq listing is arguably the most compelling aspect of Galaxy Digital’s redomicile strategy. Listing on a major U.S. exchange like Nasdaq is a game-changer for crypto firms, offering a multitude of benefits that can propel growth and legitimacy. Let’s delve into why a Nasdaq listing is such a significant step: Increased Visibility and Credibility: Listing on Nasdaq instantly elevates Galaxy Digital’s profile on the global stage. It signals a commitment to transparency, corporate governance, and regulatory compliance, enhancing credibility among institutional investment firms, retail investors, and the broader financial community. Enhanced Liquidity and Trading Volume: Nasdaq provides a highly liquid and efficient trading environment. A listing is expected to significantly increase trading volume for Galaxy Digital’s shares, making it easier for investors to buy and sell, and potentially attracting more institutional investors who require deep liquidity. Access to a Wider Investor Base: Many institutional investors and large investment funds are restricted from investing in companies listed on foreign exchanges or those not meeting specific listing requirements. A Nasdaq listing opens the doors to this massive pool of capital, potentially driving significant investment into Galaxy Digital and the broader crypto market. Benchmarking and Valuation: Listing on Nasdaq allows for easier benchmarking against traditional financial services firms and tech companies. It provides a more transparent and recognized framework for valuation, which is crucial for attracting investors and facilitating future capital raises. Galaxy Digital: A Pioneer in Institutional Crypto Services Founded by Michael Novogratz, Galaxy Digital has established itself as a leading player in providing diversified financial services for digital assets. The firm’s expertise spans across various sectors of the crypto ecosystem, making it a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset world. What makes Galaxy Digital stand out in the competitive crypto landscape? Service Area Description Significance Asset Management Offers a range of investment products and strategies focused on digital assets, catering to institutional and high-net-worth clients. Provides regulated and professionally managed avenues for institutional investment in crypto. Trading Provides over-the-counter (OTC) trading, derivatives, and algorithmic trading services for digital assets. Facilitates efficient and liquid trading for institutional clients in the often-volatile crypto markets. Investment Banking Offers advisory services for mergers and acquisitions, capital raising, and restructuring within the digital asset industry. Supports the growth and maturation of the crypto industry by providing traditional financial expertise. Mining Operates proprietary Bitcoin mining operations and provides infrastructure for other mining operations. Contributes to the security and decentralization of blockchain networks, a fundamental aspect of the crypto ecosystem. Challenges and Considerations for Galaxy Digital’s US Move While the redomicile and Nasdaq listing are overwhelmingly positive developments, there are challenges and considerations to acknowledge. Navigating the U.S. regulatory landscape, even in a crypto-friendly state like Delaware, requires careful planning and execution. What hurdles might Galaxy Digital face? Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased visibility as a publicly listed U.S. company will bring heightened regulatory scrutiny from agencies like the SEC. Maintaining compliance and navigating evolving regulations will be an ongoing priority. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile. As a publicly traded crypto firm, Galaxy Digital’s stock price will be subject to the same market fluctuations, potentially impacting investor sentiment. Competition: The crypto financial services space is becoming increasingly competitive. Galaxy Digital will need to continue innovating and differentiating itself to maintain its leadership position amidst growing competition from both traditional finance and crypto-native firms. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? Galaxy Digital’s move is more than just a company-specific event; it’s a bellwether for the broader crypto market. It sends a powerful signal that institutional adoption is accelerating and that the U.S. is becoming a more welcoming and strategic location for crypto businesses. What are the key takeaways for the crypto industry and investors? Validation of Crypto as an Asset Class: A prominent crypto firm like Galaxy Digital listing on Nasdaq further validates cryptocurrencies as a legitimate and investable asset class in the eyes of mainstream finance. Increased Institutional Confidence: This move is likely to boost confidence among institutional investment firms, encouraging greater participation and capital allocation to the crypto market. Positive Regulatory Signal: Galaxy Digital’s decision suggests a growing confidence in the U.S. regulatory environment for crypto, potentially encouraging other firms to consider the U.S. as a domicile. Catalyst for Further Growth: The increased visibility, liquidity, and investor access stemming from a Nasdaq listing can act as a catalyst for further growth and innovation within the entire crypto ecosystem. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Crypto Mainstream Adoption Galaxy Digital’s strategic redomicile to the U.S. and planned Nasdaq listing represents a bold and forward-thinking move. It underscores the increasing maturity of the cryptocurrency market and the growing acceptance of digital assets within traditional financial frameworks. By embracing U.S. regulations and seeking the visibility of a Nasdaq listing, Galaxy Digital is not only positioning itself for future growth but also paving the way for greater institutional participation and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. This landmark decision is a testament to the enduring potential of digital assets and their integration into the global financial landscape.

The proposal, posted on the web3 voting platform Snapshot on Apr. 7, suggests listing an initial PT test asset. Pendle ( PENDL ) is a decentralized finance protocol that lets users split yield-bearing tokens into two parts; the Principal Tokens and Yield Tokens. PTs represent the original value of the token and can be redeemed at full value once they mature, making them similar to fixed-income instruments. YTs, on the other hand, give holders access to the future yield generated by the underlying asset. The proposal recommends starting with a listing of one PT test token. While it does not suggest immediate onboarding, the goal is to evaluate user demand and technical integration. To reduce extra risk, the idea is to start with PT tokens linked to assets that are already supported on Aave ( AAVE ), like sUSDe. You might also like: Aave integrates Chainlink SVR to recapture oracle-related MEV Over the years, Pendle’s total value locked has risen to over $3 billion as interest in tokenized yield trading grows. The demand for using PTs as collateral has increased along with Pendle’s growth . By allowing users to borrow against PTs, Aave could capitalize on this momentum, giving yield traders new strategies and possibly unlocking billions in new loan volume. Aave intends to use a proprietary pricing technique known as the “linearly increasing lower bound” model to account for the distinct structure of PTs. After assessing the integration, Aave’s risk service providers will set the risk parameters. The proposal lays the groundwork for future, broader support of PT tokens, even though the test PT token won’t be onboarded right away due to ongoing discussions about related assets. The proposal’s Snapshot vote opened on Apr. 7 and will end on April 11. So far, 100% of the 6,500 DAO members that have voted have given the proposal a thumbs up. According to data from DeFiLlama, Aave’s V3 platform is still among the biggest in DeFi, with over $16.2 billion in total value locked and $9.9 billion in outstanding loans. The inflows for April have already reached $1.3 billion, surpassing $984 million recorded in March.

This decline led to a surge in selling activity, with many traders choosing to cut their losses. A key whale metric now hints that ETH may drop to the next support level of $1,290 before making a significant rebound. Ethereum Whale Average Cost Basis Hints at Drop to $1,290 Data from CryptoQuant shows that most Ethereum holders, excluding whales, have been sitting on massive losses since ETH plunged below $2,200. This is a key Ethereum price level that marks the average cost basis at which most traders purchased Ethereum. Meanwhile, the realized price of whales holding more than 100,000 ETH lies much lower at $1,290. As Ethereum price struggles at the multi-year lows and shows signs of plunging further, whales may begin to dump their holdings to minimize losses. This makes it likely for ETH to drop and find support at $1,290. ETH Whale Average Cost Basis The CryptoQuant analysis identified that Ethereum has previously dropped to find support at the realized price of whales. For instance, in 2022, during the Terra Luna collapse, ETH price dropped to test support at $870 before making a strong rebound. However, on-chain data indicates that whales remain bullish. This cohort quickly accumulated during the recent dip. According to SpotOnChain , Ethereum’s drop below $1,700 led to two major whale addresses buying 30,000 ETH valued at more than $49 million. Analysts Remain Bullish on Ethereum Price Analysts remain bullish that Ethereum price will register a strong rebound, and potentially reclaim levels above $2,000. One analyst observed that after the recent crash, ETH is now mimicking the March 2020 market crash that saw the price forming a local bottom. Trader Crypto General shared a similar Ethereum price prediction , noting that after the recent drop, Ethereum price tested a major support level at $1,500. If ETH defends this support level, it will enter into consolidation before being followed by a massive pump. Ethereum price chart Amid these bullish projections, it is likely that Ethereum price will defend levels above $1,400 and avoid a crash to $1,000. Ethereum Derivatives Data Shows a Bullish Outlook The derivatives market showed a bullish outlook towards Ethereum price. The liquidation heatmap with a seven-day lookback period shows that ETH has wiped out all the long positions after the recent crypto market crash . This removes the risk of further dips due to forced selling. At the same time, there is a hot liquidation zone above price at $1,837. This zone might act as a magnet, that may push ETH higher. Ethereum Liquidation Heatmap The $1,837 price level is also where many short positions on Ethereum will be liquidated if the altcoin rallies higher. The liquidation of these short positions will increase the buy-side pressure and spark notable price gains. To sum up, Ethereum price may be poised to make a rebound despite the support level for whales standing at $1,290. Derivatives data and the price prediction shared by analysts indicate that it might make a strong rebound.

The court also granted Binance’s request to annul an order that allowed legal documents to be served via email, citing the exchange’s lack of a physical office in Nigeria. As reported by Reuters, Binance’s lawyer, Chukwuka Ikwuazom, argued that the FIRS had not obtained court approval to serve documents outside Nigeria, a requirement he claims was overlooked.

Bitcoin plunges 5%, tests $84,600, potential 91% Ethereum crash as whales sell $1.42B. But, even amidst the bloodshed, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has remained untouched, with its presale gaining momentum as Phase 4 continues to fly off the shelf. Having raised $6.3 million and generated 7,900 holders, MUTM’s resistance against the bearish tide serves to highlight its unique value proposition — a combination of decentralized lending mechanics and aggressive tokenomics ready to transform DeFi’s profit potential. Bearish Signals Accumulate as Bitcoin and Ethereum Fall Bitcoin’s inability to retake the $86,200 resistance has crystallized fears of a “death cross” that’s looming, a historically bearish technical pattern preceding sharp drops. Analysts are now warning that the price could fall as low as $80,000, wiping out weeks of gains. Ethereum shares this fragility, with its daily $32 billion volume highlighting investors’ jitteriness. The asset’s vulnerability to Bitcoin — set to drop to 0.0020 BTC according to forecasts — shows a loss of faith in the once-mighty titans. Spooked by $1.6 trillion in destabilized market cap, traders are fleeing to alternatives that provide insulation from volatility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Finally Gets On Track As the market responds, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) responds — its Phase 4 presale exceeds all expectations, as investors turn to real utility. Available at $0.025, the strategic rise of this token secures a 20% jump to $0.03 in Phase 5, providing instant profits for early investors. Leaving aside presale mechanics, MUTM’s listing price of $0.06 represents an upward 140% profit, with post-launch forecasts suggesting an out-of-this-world price spike to $3.50 — a 13,900% rise on today’s entry point. This sentiment comes from Mutuum Finance’s lending backbone that allows mtTokens to earn passive yield and its buy-and-distribute mechanic to create sustainable buy pressure through strategically executed buybacks. Designed for the Long-Term Market Cycles Whereas speculative peers aim high and wide, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) finds value in real-world DeFi applications. Users deposit ETH or stablecoins, minting interest bearing mtTokens that accrue value over time. Borrowers access liquidity through overcollateralized loans in order to minimize the risks of system default and maintain stability. This balance of lender incentives with borrower safeguards facilitates organic growth then together with a peer-to-peer lending portal for niche assets such as meme coins, creates explosive potential. This innovation has magnetised 7,950 holders, with many securing Phase 4 20% off before the next price surge. Mutuum Finance’s team is also preparing a Certik audit of its smart contracts to consolidate investor trust. The results from the audit, once completed, will be broadcasted over social channels that were deemed most effective, reinforcing transparency. At the same time, a $100,000 giveaway adds urgency to the presale, with ten individuals winning $10,000 each — which is another strategy to increase FOMO as the window of opportunity to Phase 4 continues to shrink. A Rare Opportunity in Chaotic Times Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a new path amidst market uncertainty for Bitcoin and Ethereum. So far, its presale is over 35% complete, providing a limited opportunity to buy tokens at under $0.03 — a price point that disappears after Phase 5 begins. Already with $6.3 million in the bag, and bullish signs to boot, pausing could put you outside the window on one of 2025’s most hotly-anticipated DeFi launches. The project’s revenue-generative token burns, dynamic interest rates and forthcoming exchange listings dovetail into a formula for exponential growth.

The President team recently proposed distributing a significant amount of their newly launched stablecoin to eligible users. How to farm? Let’s discuss this. World Liberty Financial Airdrop Announced Amid Stabelcoin Launch World Liberty Financial, launched in September 2024, has gained significant traction in the crypto industry due to its constant crypto buying. Although it is a simple process, it always influences the price of the digital assets, benefitting traders. The platform has already raised $550M through token sales and recently launched the USD1 stablecoin in March. Interestingly, along with the stablecoin, World Liberty Financial has also proposed a USD1 airdrop to reward its supporters. More importantly, this is to test their airdrop system to ensure that it functions properly. Additionally, to increase the visibility of the USD1 stablecoin. As a result, it has become one of the most anticipated crypto airdrops of 2025 . A few investors call it the way to regulatory freedom. However, a lot is at stake in Congress debating the bipartisan STABLE Act and the crypto market crash amid tariff. USD1 Airdrop Listing, Allocation, & Other Details Although the USD1 stablecoin airdrop has been proposed, every other information, like listing date, tokenomics, allocation, and others, is unknown at this point. However, it is certain that all the current WLFI token holders are subject to receiving, but based on eligibility. The official World Liberty Financial proposal reveals that the distribution will be on-chain through the WLFI airdrop system on the Ethereum mainnet. For now, it is up for community discussion and feedback, which will finalize the USD1 airdrop amount. Next is governance, and last is the execution. The important point to note is that the WLFI can cancel or pause the airdrop even if it gets approved. How to Farm the Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial Airdrop? Since the WLFI airdrop has not yet been confirmed, all investors should interact with the Donald Trump crypto project for better visibility. The proposal mentions that it will be open to all who hold the WLFI token, so investors must hold it until the snapshot. All other crypto airdrop records reveal that the amount of holding also determines the allocation quantity, so investors can try to have a higher count. Additionally, having a non-custodial wallet with WLFI holding may work better than an exchange or a custodial wallet. Getting involved with the Ethereum mainnet can also help in farming the Donald Trump airdrop, as it will happen there. Lastly, stay updated with further World Liberty Financial news or updates to address any changes in eligibility or allocation.

It will settle on the last business day of each month. If regulators approve Cboe’s application, the futures would begin trading on April 28, it said.

They are a popular vehicle to hedge and manage risk and capitalize on trends and market behavior.

Despite speculation and hopes for a potential easing of trade tensions, Trump’s recent statement confirms his administration’s continued commitment to leveraging tariffs as a key tool in international trade negotiations. But what does this unwavering approach mean for the global economy, and how could it potentially shape the future of trade and financial landscapes? Let’s delve deeper into this developing story and understand the implications. Why Trump Tariffs Remain a Cornerstone of US Trade Policy? During his time in office, Donald Trump implemented a series of significant tariffs on goods imported into the United States, targeting countries like China, Mexico, and Canada, among others. His rationale, as consistently articulated, was to protect American industries, reduce trade deficits, and encourage other nations to engage in fairer trade practices with the U.S. Trump’s recent remarks, reported by USA Today on April 7th, suggest no change in this perspective. He explicitly stated he has “no plans to halt his tariff policies,” emphasizing that numerous countries are now approaching the U.S. to negotiate deals. This stance can be broken down into a few key elements: Negotiating Leverage: Tariffs are being used as a strategic tool to bring countries to the negotiating table. The pressure of tariffs, Trump believes, compels nations to seek agreements with the U.S. Fair Deals: Trump emphasizes the goal is to secure “fair deals” for the United States. The definition of ‘fair’ in this context often involves reducing trade imbalances and ensuring reciprocal market access. Revenue Generation: Beyond trade balance, Trump also pointed out that tariffs would result in “substantial tariffs” being paid to the U.S. This revenue aspect adds another layer to the policy’s perceived benefits. What is the Broader Impact of Global Trade Tensions? Trump’s unwavering stance on tariffs has far-reaching implications for the global economic landscape. Trade is the lifeblood of the modern globalized world, and tariffs act as barriers, potentially disrupting established supply chains and trade relationships. Let’s consider some of the key impacts: Increased Costs for Businesses and Consumers: Tariffs directly increase the cost of imported goods. These costs are often passed on to businesses, who may then pass them on to consumers in the form of higher prices. This can lead to inflationary pressures and reduced consumer purchasing power. Supply Chain Disruptions: Companies that rely on global supply chains can face significant disruptions when tariffs are imposed. They may need to find alternative suppliers, relocate production, or absorb higher costs, all of which can impact efficiency and profitability. Retaliatory Tariffs: When one country imposes tariffs, it often leads to retaliatory measures from affected nations. This can escalate into trade disputes or even trade wars, where multiple countries impose tariffs on each other’s goods, further disrupting global trade flows. Economic Slowdown: Trade wars and increased trade barriers can contribute to a slowdown in global economic growth. Reduced trade volumes, increased uncertainty, and dampened business investment can all negatively impact economic activity. Geopolitical Implications: Trade tensions can also strain political relationships between countries. They can be used as leverage in broader geopolitical negotiations, adding complexity to international relations. Analyzing the Economic Impact of Tariffs The economic effects of tariffs are a subject of ongoing debate among economists. While proponents argue that tariffs can protect domestic industries and create jobs, critics point to the potential for negative consequences. Let’s examine both sides of the argument: Potential Benefits of Tariffs Potential Challenges of Tariffs Protection of Domestic Industries: Tariffs can shield domestic industries from foreign competition, allowing them to grow and thrive. Job Creation: By encouraging domestic production, tariffs are argued to create jobs within the protected industries. Reduced Trade Deficits: Tariffs can reduce imports, potentially narrowing trade deficits. National Security: In strategic sectors, tariffs can be used to protect domestic production deemed essential for national security. Higher Consumer Prices: Tariffs increase the cost of imported goods, leading to higher prices for consumers. Reduced Consumer Choice: Tariffs can limit the availability of imported goods, reducing consumer choice. Damage to Export Industries: Retaliatory tariffs can harm a country’s export industries. Inefficiency and Reduced Innovation: Protection from competition can lead to inefficiency and reduced innovation within domestic industries. Global Economic Instability: Trade wars and escalating tariffs can create uncertainty and instability in the global economy. US Trade Policy : What’s Next? With Trump’s continued commitment to tariffs, the future of US trade policy remains closely watched. Several key questions arise: Will other countries continue to negotiate? Trump’s strategy hinges on the belief that tariffs will incentivize other nations to negotiate trade deals favorable to the U.S. Whether this approach will continue to be effective remains to be seen. How will businesses adapt? Companies operating in global markets will need to strategize how to navigate the ongoing tariff landscape. This may involve diversifying supply chains, lobbying for policy changes, or adjusting pricing strategies. What are the long-term implications? The long-term effects of sustained tariff policies on global trade, economic growth, and international relations are still unfolding. Economists and policymakers will be closely monitoring these developments. For investors and businesses, understanding the nuances of tariff measures and their potential impact is crucial. Staying informed about policy changes, analyzing market trends, and adapting to evolving trade dynamics will be key to navigating this complex environment. Conclusion: Navigating the Tariff Terrain Donald Trump’s unwavering stance on tariffs signals a continued era of assertive US Trade Policy . While the intended goals may be to secure fairer trade deals and protect American interests, the broader implications for the global economy are significant and multifaceted. From increased consumer costs and supply chain disruptions to potential economic slowdowns and geopolitical tensions, the ripple effects of tariff policies are wide-ranging. Businesses and individuals alike must remain vigilant, informed, and adaptable as they navigate this evolving trade landscape. The path forward will require careful consideration of both the potential benefits and the inherent risks associated with tariffs in a deeply interconnected world.

This move, seen as a response to increasing U.S. trade tariff pressure, is making waves in financial markets. However, this drop in the yuan’s value could lead to something bigger—more interest in Bitcoin. Experts at 10x Research say a similar situation in 2015 led to a big jump in Bitcoin’s price. Could this be the start of another major rise for crypto? China Eases Control Over the Yuan For years, China has tightly controlled the yuan, keeping its value within a set range. However, on April 8, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) set the yuan’s exchange rate at 7.2038 per U.S. dollar—the weakest level in months. This move suggests that China may be allowing the currency to weaken further to keep its exports competitive, especially as U.S. tariffs continue to rise. JUST IN: China's yuan falls to lowest against US Dollar since 2023 — The Spectator Index (@spectatorindex) April 8, 2025 Tensions between the two economic giants escalated even more when former U.S. President Donald Trump issued a warning about higher tariffs on Chinese imports. Posting on Truth Social, he stated, “If China doesn’t remove its 34% increase on trade by April 8, 2025, the U.S. will add a 50% tariff starting April 9. Additionally, we will end all talks with China regarding their requested meetings.” Bitcoin Could Benefit from Yuan Weakness Crypto experts believe that as the yuan weakens, Chinese investors might turn to Bitcoin as a safe haven for their money. Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research , pointed out that a similar situation happened in 2015 when China devalued the yuan. At that time, Bitcoin initially dipped but then skyrocketed by nearly 60% within four months. Ben Zhou, CEO of the crypto exchange Bybit, echoed this sentiment, saying that in the past, whenever the yuan dropped, large amounts of Chinese capital flowed into Bitcoin. If history repeats itself, Bitcoin could see a strong bullish trend in the coming months. Challenges for Chinese Crypto Investors Even though Bitcoin might get more attention, China’s strict rules make it hard for people to invest in crypto. The country has some of the toughest restrictions, and banks must now track and report any suspicious international transactions, including those with crypto. Since August 2024, the risks of using cryptocurrency have also increased. The government is working harder to stop money from leaving the country through digital assets, which could slow down Bitcoin’s rise.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-08 07:42:58

While the lawsuit filed against many cryptocurrency platforms, including Ripple and Coinbase, was closed, a Crypto Task Force was established to make regulations in the crypto field. In this context, the Crypto Task Force announced that it will hold a critical meeting on April 11, and also published the list of executives of US crypto and finance giants who will attend the meeting. Coinbase and Uniswap (UNI) Will Participate! Accordingly, it was reported that Coinbase and Uniswap will attend the SEC meeting as panelists. The list includes notable names from the crypto industry, such as Uniswap Labs Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Katherine Minarik, Coinbase chief executive Gregory Tusar, and Cumberland associate general counsel Chelsea Pizzola. The meeting will also be attended by senior officials SEC member and Crypto Task Force Leader Hester Peirce and interim SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda. Also attending the meeting will be New York Stock Exchange Chief Product Officer Jon Herrick, FalconX Business Leader Austin Reid, security tokenization firm Texture Capital CEO Richard Johnson, and University of California, Berkeley Chief Financial Officer Christine Parlour. The SEC said that a roundtable meeting on April 11 will discuss how crypto trading rules should be handled, and the meeting is called “Between Obstacle and Hardship: Adapting Regulation for Crypto Trading.” This meeting will be the second of the Crypto Task Force's meetings on cryptocurrencies. A lawsuit had been filed before! As you may recall, the SEC had filed a lawsuit against Cumberland and Coinbase for allegedly violating securities laws under the Joe Biden administration, but both cases were dropped this year under the Donald Trump administration. The SEC also launched an investigation into Uniswap in 2024, but that investigation was also closed in February. *This is not investment advice.

In the following lines, we will explore them and touch upon the latest price dynamics of its native token. The first XRP ETF in the US is on the way Earlier this week, asset manager Teucrium Investment Advisors revealed plans to launch the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF (ticker: XXRP). The investment vehicle received the necessary green light from the New York Stock Exchange and is expected to go live today (April 8). It is a 2x leveraged product designed to give traders double the daily price movement of the underlying asset. The company issuing the ETF explained that it is suitable for investors with “a short-term high-conviction view on XRP prices.” Teucrium also outlined that such developments could influence supply and demand for Ripple’s cross-border token, but warned that usage growth is not guaranteed. “Declining usage could heighten volatility or lower XRP’s price, negatively affecting the Fund,” it concluded. Meanwhile, investors are waiting for the launch of a spot XRP ETF in America. The companies willing to introduce such an investment vehicle include Grayscale, Bitwise, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and others. Rumors of a potential partnership with Cardano Several hours ago, Ripple uploaded a short video on X , predicting that tokenization could reshape global finance in the next years. It touched upon some important factors that may play a role in reaching that goal, but one particular element grabbed the attention of industry participants. The clip starts with a glimpse of Cardano’s logo, which led some to speculate that the two entities might soon announce a collaboration. This is not the first time the two have been rumored to shake hands. Towards the end of last year, Ripple’s CEO – Brad Garlinghouse – and Cardano’s founder – Charles Hoskinson – exchanged kind words. Shortly after, the latter hinted that Cardano might integrate Ripple’s stablecoin – RLUSD – into its system. “We’ve already had a call with the RLUSD people. We are actively talking,” he stated at the time. XRP price predictions The native token of Ripple witnessed a major decline at the start of the business week when the entire crypto market nosedived . XRP plummeted to approximately $1.65, a level last observed in November 2024. Nonetheless, the price rebounded from the local bottom and currently stands at around $1.87 (per CoinGecko’s data). Many analysts noted the revival , making interesting predictions for the short term. The X user CRYPTOWZRD believes that moving above the $2 resistance level could ignite a rally to as high as $2.80. “However, if Bitcoin continues to cause trouble, XRP may still decline to the $1.5160 daily support target,” they added. For their part, Crazy Buddha thinks the recent market pullback “is just setting up for a stronger rally.” The analyst claimed that XRP “is currently forming a triangle consolidation pattern, and a trend shift is about to happen.” Those willing to explore additional forecasts can take a look at our dedicated article here . The massive whale transfer Last but not least , we will mention the actions of an unknown large investor who recently moved 200 million XRP (worth over $370 million at current rates) to Binance. Such transfers generally indicate that the whale is preparing to cash out, which could increase the selling pressure and negatively impact the asset’s price.

Jupiter, the leading Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX), has just dropped a bombshell announcement via X, revealing a suite of major upgrades and exciting new product launches slated for April. This isn’t just a routine update; it’s a comprehensive overhaul designed to elevate user experience and expand Jupiter’s already impressive capabilities within the DeFi space. Buckle up, crypto enthusiasts, because April is shaping up to be a game-changer for Jupiter and the entire Solana network! What Major Upgrades Can We Expect from Jupiter in April? Jupiter is not holding back! The announced upgrades are ambitious and touch upon several key areas of their platform. Let’s dive into the specifics of what users can anticipate next month: Jupiter Mobile V2: A Quantum Leap in Mobile DeFi “Jupiter Trenches”: A New Frontier in Decentralized Trading Strategic Partnerships: Expanding the Jupiter Ecosystem These three pillars form the foundation of Jupiter’s April upgrade strategy. Each element is crucial and promises to bring significant enhancements to the platform. Let’s explore each of these in detail to understand the potential impact. Jupiter Mobile V2: Is This the Revolutionary Mobile DeFi Experience We’ve Been Waiting For? Jupiter Mobile V2 is touted as the most significant app upgrade to date. In today’s fast-paced world, mobile accessibility is paramount. A robust and user-friendly mobile app can be a massive advantage for any DEX . But what exactly makes V2 so special? While specific details are still eagerly awaited, we can infer that Jupiter Mobile V2 will likely focus on: Enhanced User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX): Expect a smoother, more intuitive interface that simplifies navigation and trading on the go. Mobile DeFi should be as seamless as traditional mobile banking or trading apps. Expanded Functionality: Beyond basic token swaps, V2 might introduce advanced trading features, staking options, or even access to Jupiter’s new “Trenches” platform directly from the mobile app. Improved Performance and Speed: Optimized for mobile devices, V2 should deliver faster loading times and smoother performance, crucial for real-time trading and monitoring the dynamic crypto markets. Security Enhancements: Mobile security is paramount. V2 will likely incorporate the latest security protocols to ensure user funds and data are protected while trading on mobile. Benefit: Jupiter Mobile V2 aims to break down barriers to entry for mobile users, making DeFi more accessible to a wider audience. Imagine trading your favorite Solana tokens, providing liquidity, or managing your portfolio all from the palm of your hand with a seamless and powerful app. This upgrade could significantly boost Jupiter’s user base and trading volume. Challenge: Mobile app development can be complex. Ensuring consistent performance across various devices and operating systems while maintaining top-notch security will be a key challenge for the Jupiter team. User adoption will also depend on how effectively Jupiter communicates the benefits and ease of use of the new mobile app. “Jupiter Trenches”: Diving Deep into a New Decentralized Trading Platform “Jupiter Trenches” is perhaps the most intriguing announcement. The name itself evokes a sense of depth and potentially, more advanced trading functionalities. What could this new decentralized trading platform entail? Considering the name “Trenches,” it’s plausible that Jupiter is venturing into more sophisticated trading instruments or features beyond simple token swaps. Here are some possibilities: Perpetual Futures or Margin Trading: “Trenches” could be Jupiter’s foray into offering perpetual futures contracts or margin trading, allowing users to leverage their positions and potentially amplify profits (and risks). This would cater to more experienced traders seeking advanced strategies. Options Trading: Another advanced trading feature that fits the “Trenches” theme is options trading. This would open up a new dimension of trading strategies for Jupiter users, allowing for hedging, speculation, and income generation. Advanced Order Types: “Trenches” might introduce more complex order types beyond market and limit orders, such as stop-loss orders, take-profit orders, or trailing stop orders, giving traders greater control and precision in their trading. Institutional-Grade Features: The “Trenches” platform could be designed to attract institutional traders by offering features like low latency execution, advanced charting tools, or API access for algorithmic trading. Benefit: “Jupiter Trenches” has the potential to position Jupiter as a comprehensive DEX catering to both novice and advanced traders. By offering more sophisticated trading tools, Jupiter can attract a wider range of users and increase trading volume and liquidity on its platform. It could also tap into the growing demand for advanced DeFi trading products. Challenge: Developing and launching a robust and secure platform for advanced trading features is technically complex. Jupiter will need to ensure the platform is resilient to market volatility, provides sufficient liquidity, and offers a user-friendly experience for sophisticated trading strategies. Educating users about the risks and complexities of advanced trading will also be crucial. Strategic Partnerships: How Will They Enhance the Solana DEX Ecosystem? Strategic partnerships are the lifeblood of growth in the crypto space. Collaborations can bring new users, technologies, and opportunities to a platform. Jupiter’s announcement of new strategic partnerships hints at a broader vision for expanding its ecosystem and reach within the Solana DEX landscape. What kinds of partnerships could Jupiter be forging? Wallet Integrations: Partnering with popular Solana wallets would streamline user onboarding and access to Jupiter’s platform. Seamless wallet integration is crucial for user convenience. Project Collaborations: Partnering with other Solana-based projects, such as lending platforms, yield aggregators, or NFT marketplaces, could create synergistic opportunities and expand the utility of Jupiter’s platform. Cross-Chain Bridges: Collaborations with cross-chain bridge providers could enable users to bring assets from other blockchains to Solana and trade them on Jupiter, expanding its reach beyond the Solana ecosystem. Data Providers and Analytics Platforms: Partnering with data providers and analytics platforms could enhance Jupiter’s platform with richer market data, charting tools, and analytical insights for traders. Benefit: Strategic partnerships can accelerate Jupiter’s growth, expand its user base, and enhance its platform’s functionality and appeal. By collaborating with key players in the crypto space, Jupiter can solidify its position as a leading Solana DEX and contribute to the overall growth of the Solana ecosystem. Challenge: Successful partnerships require careful selection and alignment of goals. Jupiter will need to choose partners that genuinely add value to its ecosystem and ensure seamless integration and collaboration. Managing multiple partnerships effectively can also be a logistical challenge. Why These Upgrades Matter for the Future of Crypto Upgrades and DeFi Jupiter’s April upgrades are not just about incremental improvements; they represent a significant leap forward in its evolution as a leading Solana DEX . These updates highlight several key trends in the broader crypto and DeFi space: Trend Jupiter’s Upgrade Relevance Mobile-First DeFi: The increasing importance of mobile access to DeFi services. Jupiter Mobile V2 directly addresses this trend, making DeFi more accessible on mobile devices. Advanced Trading Features on DEXs: The demand for sophisticated trading tools beyond simple swaps on decentralized exchanges. “Jupiter Trenches” aims to cater to this demand by potentially introducing features like futures, options, or margin trading. Ecosystem Expansion through Partnerships: The power of collaborations in driving growth and innovation in crypto. Jupiter’s strategic partnerships underscore the importance of ecosystem building and collaboration in the DeFi space. User Experience Focus: The growing recognition that user-friendliness is crucial for mainstream DeFi adoption. All of Jupiter’s upgrades, particularly Mobile V2, seem to prioritize enhancing user experience and making DeFi more accessible and intuitive. These upgrades demonstrate Jupiter’s commitment to innovation and its ambition to remain at the forefront of the DeFi revolution. By addressing key trends and user needs, Jupiter is positioning itself for continued growth and success in the competitive DEX landscape. Conclusion: A Thrilling April Awaits for Jupiter and the Solana Ecosystem Jupiter’s announcement of major April upgrades has sent ripples of excitement through the Solana and broader crypto community. With a revamped mobile app, a potentially groundbreaking new trading platform in “Jupiter Trenches,” and strategic partnerships on the horizon, Jupiter is poised for a transformative month. These upgrades are not just about enhancing a platform; they are about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in decentralized finance and making DeFi more accessible, powerful, and user-friendly for everyone.

The price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP value has surged by 9.56% in 24 hours to $1.85. In the latest update on the Ripple vs SEC case, Attorney Fred Rispoli has provided an updated timeline for the SEC v. Ripple case. He stated that the necessary documentation had already been produced following Alderoty’s declaration, and they are now awaiting a vote by the SEC Commission, which is expected in 30 days. Following this, the SEC will file a motion to lift the injunction, which Ripple will not contest. Once the judge signs off, the case will be finalized, most likely within 60 days. Coming to the expenses, which Ripple will be bearing, the case will be settled with a $50 Million payout to the SEC. That being said, we can expect the process to expedite, as Paul Atkins has given a positive statement in a recent speech about cryptocurrencies. Talking about the XRP price, it is up by 9.56% to $1.85. If the bullish momentum kick starts, XRP could aim at its resistance level of $2.024. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, the XRP price could take a plunge to $1.68. Our XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “Will XRP reach $10 in 2025?” by providing short-term and long-term Ripple (XRP) price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 1.85957621 10.03% Market cap $ 108,359,599,110.22 Circulating Supply 58,274,974,538.00 Trading Volume $ 10,424,511,550.8586 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Price Prediction 2025 The SEC believes that XRP can help release funds stuck in the U.S. Nostro accounts, which can then be used to buy more Bitcoins. There is more positive news for Ripple, as they have integrated their stablecoin RLUSD into their cross-border payments network: Ripple Payments . Moreover, Ripple has received approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to offer regulated crypto payments in the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC). If things go in favor of Ripple, the XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain under a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP price will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second-largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the XRP price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.87. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the long-term XRP price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050.

This happens despite the fact that Michael Egorov has offloaded nearly $2 million in CRV tokens over the past two weeks. This is because the leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol witnessed a record Q1, with $35 billion in trading activity, despite a sluggish market. Curve Finance Price Is Up 10%, $3 Rally Coming? After the crypto market crash on Black Monday, the Curve DAO (CRV) price bounced back over 10%, currently trading at $0.45 with its daily trading volume surging 27% to $240 million. As per the Coinglass data , the CRV futures open interest is up 6% to more than $107 million, showing strong bullish sentiment among traders. Prominent market analyst The Mental Trader has reiterated his bullish outlook on Curve (CRV), forecasting a rise to $3+ based on Elliott Wave (EW) theory. Despite recent price fluctuations, the analyst maintains that CRV remains in the “third of the third” mega wave upwards while hinting at a potential long-term upside. The trader shows that the recent Curve Finance price action is a second minor wave within the sub-third wave, and a breakout above $0.60 would confirm a bullish trajectory ahead. Source: The Mental Trader The swing low at $0.34 is highlighted as a critical level; a breach would necessitate a full revision of the EW count. Thus, traders should keep a close eye on CRV’s price action as it approaches pivotal resistance levels. Founder Michael Egorov on CRV Selling Spree Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov has resumed offloading CRV tokens amid a market rebound. On his latest sale, Egorov offloaded 236,457 CRV tokens valued at approximately $108,000. Egorov has sold a cumulative 3.083 million CRV tokens since March 24, amounting to $1.62 million. The tokens were sold at an average price of $0.527, strategically executed near local price peaks as reported by Spot On Chain. Source: Spot On Chain Surge In User Activity for Q1 The leading decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Curve Finance has witnessed a major surge in user activity during the first quarter of the year. During this period, the Curve platform clocked a massive $35 billion in trading volumes, up by 13% in comparison to the previous year. As per the data from DeFiLama, the platform’s total transactions surged from around 1.8 million to 5.5 million in the first three months. This has been one of the major reasons behind the DEX’s surge in trading volumes.

BTC at 80k,https://coinpaprika.com/news/tarrif-war-enters-new-stage,"On the fourth day of escalating tariff tensions , President Donald Trump made headlines with a bold new threat: an additional 50% tariff on Chinese goods if Beijing does not withdraw its retaliatory levies by April 9, 2025. The announcement, made via Truth Social, marked a significant escalation in the ongoing U.S.–China trade conflict. Trump said China’s 34% increase in tariffs—added on top of what he described as years of “long-term trading abuses”—would trigger further action from the U.S. unless reversed immediately. Despite increasing market anxiety, Trump remained firm. “We’re not looking at a pause,” he said, dismissing the idea of halting tariff moves to enable trade talks. Instead, he claimed “many countries” are eager to negotiate , and that any deal must be “fair” or the U.S. would cut off trade completely. His tone signaled a return to the aggressive “America First” trade posture seen during his presidency. Supporting Trump’s stance, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said the administration had been in touch with officials from over 50 countries interested in forging new trade deals. The message was clear: the U.S. is open to partnerships—but only on its terms. China’s response came swiftly. Liu Pengyu , spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, criticized the move as “unilateralism, protectionism, and economic bullying.” He emphasized that threatening China is not a productive negotiation strategy, warning that Beijing would ""firmly safeguard"" its interests . Markets responded with volatility. The S&P 500 index, representing America’s largest companies, saw significant swings throughout the day before closing down 0.2% . Apple, which relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing, dropped 3.7% , reflecting investor concerns about potential supply chain disruptions. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, however, edged slightly upward by 0.1% , showing mixed sentiment across sectors. Meanwhile, prominent investor Ray Dalio urged the public to look beyond the headlines. In a lengthy post, Dalio argued that the current focus on tariffs misses the broader, more dangerous trends at play. He sees the situation as part of a larger breakdown in the global order —economically, politically, and geopolitically. Dalio pointed to unsustainable debt levels , both public and private, as a root cause of the growing instability. He warned that economies like the U.S. are heavily reliant on borrowing, while creditor nations like China are overexposed to American debt and overly dependent on U.S. consumers. This creates a fragile system that is starting to unravel as trust erodes and global deglobalization accelerates . He also highlighted the collapse of domestic political consensus , driven by extreme inequality in income, opportunity, and education. These internal tensions are mirrored on the global stage, where the U.S. is no longer seen as a cooperative leader but rather as a unilateral actor imposing its will . This, Dalio noted, is why the current moment resembles past historical inflection points—periods marked by civil unrest, economic depression, and even war . Dalio cautioned against viewing tariff announcements in isolation. Instead, he emphasized understanding the five major forces reshaping the world: Monetary/economic instability from excessive debt and capital imbalances. Domestic political fragmentation between populist movements and eroding democratic norms. Geopolitical realignment , with the decline of U.S. dominance and rise of multipolar tensions. Environmental disruptions , such as climate change and pandemics. Technological revolutions , like AI, that are transforming economies and societies. He warned that Trump's trade actions, while headline-grabbing, are symptoms of a much larger systemic change . Ignoring these deeper dynamics could leave policymakers and investors unprepared for the massive shifts ahead. In conclusion, Trump’s tariff threat may have shaken the markets for a day, but experts like Dalio suggest a much longer, more turbulent road lies ahead . The interplay between trade tensions and deeper structural challenges could reshape the global economy in profound and unpredictable ways.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-04-08 07:46:31

The platform is poised for major achievements as the Ripple case nears its long-awaited conclusion after the XRP community’s four-year struggle. With about 20 XRP ETFs ready to launch, advocate John Deaton reflects on Ripple’s journey over the past four years. Notably, John Deaton sheds light on the phenomenal evolution of Ripple since 2020, despite the ongoing legal struggles. Let’s dive into Deaton’s critical role in the Ripple vs SEC case and the company’s potential developments. XRP Lawsuit to ETF Launches: John Deaton Weighs In Reflecting on the pivotal moments that shaped the Ripple landscape, XRP attorney John Deaton shared an X post earlier today. While Ripple has achieved a major milestone in the XRP lawsuit, Deaton looks back on his pivotal decision to file a Motion to Intervene in the case. The Ripple lawsuit has since yielded significant milestones, most notably Judge Torres’ landmark decision that XRP is not classified as a security, paving the way for further growth and adoption. Building on this success, Ripple now stands triumphant with the recent launch of multiple XRP ETFs. John Deaton’s Critical Role in the Ripple vs SEC Case Interestingly, John Deaton filed a Motion to Intervene before four years, marking a significant turn in the XRP lawsuit. The lawyer asked Judge Torres to let XRP holders join the fray as defendants. Though many lawyers and individuals criticized him, he didn’t hesitate to move forward. Further, citing his intention of gaining participatory rights as amici counsel, the XRP lawyer wrote, I knew Judge Torres would never force the SEC to sue, at the time, 12,600 XRP holders (which grew to 75K) but man, did it send the right message. Other than sending that message, my real goal was to be appointed amici counsel, with participatory rights, which, in effect, she did. Moreover, Deaton expressed his delight over Judge Torres’ summary judgment, which ruled XRP as a non-security. The lawyer explained that the judge cited the significance of XRP holder affidavits in her judgment. Notably, she referenced these affidavits on two separate occasions in her written XRP lawsuit ruling. Recently, John Deaton underscored the significance of the potential tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). In addition, he revealed how cryptocurrencies could help achieve the American Dream. XRP ETFs: A Major Benchmark John Deaton’s X post on the XRP lawsuit comes in response to the latest XRP ETF development. Recently, the NYSE Arca approved the Teucrium’s 2X Long Daily XRP ETF under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. “This is like the 20th XRP related ETF. Never say you can’t make a difference!,” stated John Deaton. With multiple platforms already applied to launch an XRP ETF, the community remains optimistic of the token’s future trajectory.

On April 7, it announced the agenda and attendees of the roundtable, which many industry observers and executives hope will usher in regulations for crypto in the United States. “Hearing the public’s concerns and suggestions helps the SEC create a clear, sensible, and fair path forward for the crypto industry,” said Commissioner Hester Peirce, leader of the Crypto Task Force. Crypto Regulations Coming Peirce added that she is looking forward to this roundtable and the rest of the series “as we move toward crypto clarity for the benefit of the American public.” SEC announces agenda and panelists for roundtable on crypto trading: https://t.co/RDQyWDlE8o pic.twitter.com/T0ifWIRP3a — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) April 7, 2025 The series of roundtable discussions were announced in March and include “Know Your Custodian: Key Considerations for Crypto Custody” on April 25, “Tokenization – Moving Assets Onchain: Where TradFi and DeFi Meet” on May 12, and “DeFi and the American Spirit,” on June 6. They are open to the public both in-person via registration and via live webcast. Opening remarks will be from acting chairman Mark Uyeda, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, and Commissioner Peirce. The main roundtable discussion is moderated by Nicholas Losurdo, a Partner at Goodwin Procter, and features diverse panelists, including representatives from traditional finance, crypto companies such as Coinbase, industry associations, and academic institutions. The move is a complete about-turn for the SEC, which has spent the past few years issuing lawsuits against American crypto companies. However, most of those investigations have now been closed or settled as the regulator operates under new leadership. No Love For Markets Nevertheless, the premise of a pro-crypto regulatory environment and the fostering of investment and innovation in the US sector has done nothing to prevent a massive market sell-off this week. Total capitalization tanked to a five-month low below $2.5 trillion this week as Bitcoin sunk and altcoins were obliterated. The trade war between the Trump administration and the rest of the world, particularly China, escalated this week when the POTUS promised additional tariffs on China. China responded, stating that it would “fight to the end” and “resolutely take countermeasures to defend its own interests.” No amount of pro-crypto regulation is likely to influence sentiment in the current economic climate until the dust settles from the trade war and agreements are inked.

In a recent post , Declan Fox responds to the results of a poll regarding the project and its community. So far, around 1,000 users have voted on the polls and most have expressed that they are still waiting on a Linea token airdrop to happen. Based on the poll results, Fox revealed that the team behind the Consensys -backed protocol has chosen to wait for the market to turn bullish again before launching a TGE. “My takeaways are still to improve communication, reignite excitement around the ecosystem and raise standards across the board (we are Consensys and it’s time to show that), flip all the bears to bulls and then TGE,” said Fox. Good to see the feedback. My takeaways are still to improve communication, reignite excitement around the ecosystem and raise standards across the board (we are Consensys and it’s time to show that), flip all the bears to bulls and then TGE 🫡 — Declan Fox (@DeclanFox14) April 7, 2025 At the moment, the crypto market is still in recovery mode after experiencing a slump on April 7. Major tokens like Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) crashed alongside the stocks in Asian, European and U.S. markets after President Trump introduced blanket tariffs on imported goods from 180 countries and regions. At press time, the overall crypto market cap has risen by 1.8% or around $200 billion, from $2.4 trillion to $2.6 trillion in the past 24 hours of trading, according to data from CoinGecko. In March, former Marketing Lead of Linea, Christopher Kocurek, said in a message to the Discord community that Consensys executives and the project’s board of directors were intent on making the TGE happen in the second quarter of 2025. However, Kocurek has since left the project and joined an “early-stage startup” and no news about the TGE has come about since.

The crypto KOL said patterns observed during previous yuan devaluations in 2013 and 2015 show that a weakening Chinese currency could bump up the demand for Bitcoin. Per TradingEconomics data, the offshore Chinese yuan held steady near a two-month low at 7.35 per US Tuesday, against the backdrop of escalating hostilities between the world’s two largest economies. On Monday, President Donald Trump announced plans to impose an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports starting Wednesday, on top of existing duties totaling 54%. In response to last Wednesday’s US tariff announcement, Beijing pledged to “fight to the end” to protect its economic interests, slapping a 34% levy on all US imports to begin this Thursday. Is Bitcoin a hedge for investors escaping falling Renminbi “ If not the Fed, then the PBOC will give us the yachtzee ingredients ,” Hayes wrote on X Tuesday, referring to the People’s Bank of China. “ CNY devaluation = narrative that Chinese capital flight will flow into BTC. It worked in 2013, 2015, and can work in 2025. Ignore China at your own peril. ” If not the Fed then the PBOC will give us the yachtzee ingredients. CNY deval = narrative that Chinese capital flight will flow into $BTC . It worked in 2013 , 2015, and can work in 2025. Ignore China at your own peril. pic.twitter.com/LAOeQZEjZt — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) April 8, 2025 Hayes’ reference to 2013 and 2015 draws on episodes when the yuan devaluation coincided with major rallies in Bitcoin. In late 2013, Chinese interest in Bitcoin exponentially increased, making the digital currency exchange BTC China the largest globally by trading volume. Bitcoin started the year at just $13, soared past $1,000 in November, hitting a high of $1,163 before the PBOC intervened in December. In a mirror-similar case in August 2015, the PBOC set up a series of three consecutive yuan devaluations, reducing the currency’s value by over 3%. The central bank coined the move as a way to push the yuan’s central parity rate more “closely aligned with market forces,” a reform promoted by President Xi Jinping since he took office in March 2013. The devaluation caused Bitcoin’s price to climb and reach a high of $502, from a Q1 low of $350, by year-end 2015. Investors could turn to Bitcoin, or not The crypto community was overwhelmingly supportive of Hayes’ theory, with Bybit CEO Ben Zhou also suggesting that the renminbi’s depreciation often results in increased Chinese interest in Bitcoin. “ US vs China Tariff war…China will try to lower RMB to counter the tariff ,” Zhou said in a quoted reply to Hayes, “ Historically, whenever RMB drops, a lot of Chinese capital flows into BTC. Bullish for BTC .” Crypto commentator Crypto_BN added that Bitcoin’s function as a hedge against fiat currency will be more evident if the Chinese market leans towards crypto. “ This is crystal clear that bitcoin is being used as a hedge against their local currency. This is the exact use case that Satoshi envisioned, ” they wrote. Still, not everyone agrees the situation will unfold as it has in the past. Several commenters online questioned the feasibility of capital flight via Bitcoin, given Mainland China’s blanket ban on cryptocurrency trading and restrictions on crypto exchanges operating within its jurisdiction. “ It feels like a lot of wishful thinking ,” one critic noted, pointing to the difficulty of converting yuan into crypto without relying on Chinese banking channels. “ How much stranded Chinese capital can really escape via Bitcoin if users still need to access exchanges via Chinese banking rails? ” Another user asserted that any flight to crypto may first take a detour to stablecoins rather than direct Bitcoin purchases. “ Obviously, I have a short bias now, but I think this capital flows into USDT first ,” the commenter wrote. “ Doubt they will instantly buy. Maybe after things settle .” Beijing taking a gamble with yuan devaluation According to several economists, allowing the yuan to weaken could help boost the appeal of Chinese exports by making them cheaper in international markets. However, the strategy carries quite the risk of increased capital outflows, loss of investor confidence, and further deterioration in US-China diplomatic relations. According to analysts at Wells Fargo & Co., there is a 75% chance that the PBOC will devalue the yuan very soon. Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies Financial Group, told Bloomberg if the PBOC decides to do so, “it’s likely to go big, like 20 or 30%.” Most market strategists believe China’s approach will be measured because a sudden steep devaluation is asking the market to panic. It could create a capital flight that Beijing may find arduous to contain. Ken Cheung, chief Asia FX strategist at Mizuho Bank, expects the PBOC to allow more flexible exchange rate movements while avoiding a sharp depreciation. “ We reckon that the PBOC will allow more two-way FX flexibility gradually to adjust the choppy market after the tariff da y,” Cheung said. “ But a sharp yuan depreciation is unlikely due to capital outflow risks. The PBOC will also opt to preserve FX stability to gain room to resume monetary easing. ” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) rose 32.7% to an intraday high of $12.5 on April 8, morning Asian time, while bringing its market cap back over $4 billion. Its daily trading volume was up nearly 50% over the previous day, hovering over $246 million. The recent gains have erased the losses from the past two days, which came during a broader market sell-off . That slump followed news of new U.S. trade tariffs announced by Donald Trump, sparking fears of a global trade war and dragging down the entire crypto market by over 13%. HYPE’s rally today comes as open interest climbed back above $450 million, up 20% from the day before, hinting at growing interest from derivative traders in the market. Even though the overall derivatives market is fairly calm, positive funding rates since March 25 hint that traders are still leaning bullish. Today’s gains were accompanied by an uptick in trading activity on Hyperliquid. DeFi Llama data shows that Hyperliquid saw a huge trading volume spike, up 66% over the previous day, to hit $13.05 billion. For comparison, its biggest rival, Jupiter ( JUP ), only hit $1.6 billion. In total, Hyperliquid has processed over $1.22 trillion in volume so far, easily beating Jupiter’s $278.4 billion.

As for what’s next, crypto analyst Glitch noted HYPE is testing a key resistance level between $11.7 and $12.5. If it breaks above that, he thinks it could flip it to support and rally all the way to $18.5 or even $20.5. Sharing a 1-day HYPE/USDT chart, fellow trader Crypto Target added that HYPE needs to flip the $11.7 – $12.5 resistance range into support to avoid losses. See below. Source: X/cryptotarget11 At press time, HYPE was trading at $11.95. Hype price analysis Looking at the 4-hour chart, HYPE seems ready to break out of a falling channel that’s been in place since March 24. Traders view this as a bullish sign, which often precipitates into a bullish rally upon a successful break. HYPE price, Supertrend and MACD chart — April 8 | Source: crypto.news The MACD is showing bullish momentum too, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line. Plus, the Supertrend indicator has flipped green, which usually suggests buyers are back in control, at least for now. Hence, the most likely target for HYPE is the $15 psychological resistance level, which it failed to breach earlier this month. A breakout above this could open the path towards the $20 mark.

They achieve this by pegging their value to reserves like fiat currencies or commodities. Stablecoins are engineered to maintain a fixed exchange rate, typically one-to-one, with the underlying asset. What does “stability” mean? At its core, stability demands three pillars: Reliable collateral: The tangible assets that back the token. Transparency: The ability for anyone to independently verify reserves. Consistent peg maintenance: Robust safeguards against depegging, where a stablecoin’s market value strays from its fixed ratio with the underlying asset. Without these foundational elements, stablecoins are little more than speculative instruments masquerading as safe harbors. In 2022 alone, billions in value evaporated when supposedly “secure” stablecoins lost their pegs , meaning their market prices diverged significantly from their intended 1:1 ratio with an underlying asset — prompting an unsettling question: Can digital assets ever be genuinely stable without demonstrable and independently audited backing? The need for reliable asset-backed models Recent market events have exposed severe fundamental weaknesses in privately issued stablecoins. These tokens often rely on opaque mechanisms, inadequate audit practices or collateral that investors cannot independently verify. These shortcomings repeatedly led to sudden “depegging” events, such as the collapse of Iron Finance’s TITAN token in 2021. The overleveraged algorithmic system collapsed to near zero , wiping out billions in liquidity. TerraUSD’s meltdown in 2022 also highlighted a similar vulnerability, with the stablecoin’s value disintegrating quickly, intensifying doubts about algorithmic models lacking transparent reserves. Meanwhile, partially collateralized and so-called “fully audited” stablecoins have faced scrutiny for inconsistent disclosure practices. Even well-known issuers must constantly prove their reserves are sufficient and legitimate. Recent: The state-backed stablecoin coin to change Kyrgtzstan’s (and global) economy These issues primarily stem from insufficient oversight and ambiguous collateral management practices by private issuers. Investors typically have limited means to independently verify reserves, fueling persistent doubts about whether the stated backing genuinely exists or whether tokens are properly collateralized. Only models with tangible asset support and verifiably documented reserves can genuinely deliver the stability that digital assets promise. Through transparent frameworks, we can rebuild trust and usher in a new era of reliable digital finance. These events underscore a universal truth: True stability is forged through auditable oversight and verifiable reserves, not hollow branding. Gold is a timeless anchor Gold has served as humanity’s ultimate store of value for millennia, preserving wealth through wars, economic collapses and pandemics. Its scarcity, intrinsic worth and universal acceptance have made it a refuge when institutions falter — evidenced by its 25% surge during the 2020 market crash as investors fled volatile assets. Gold’s value transcends borders and ideologies, resting on tangible scarcity rather than hollow promises. For example, while the US dollar has lost 96.8% of its purchasing power since 1913, gold has consistently preserved and even grown its purchasing power. This track record positions it as an ideal anchor for digital assets seeking stability in a volatile crypto landscape. Critics of gold might point to its storage and custodial costs, along with the logistical challenges of physically moving bullion. Modern vaulting solutions and robust insurance measures have, however, largely mitigated these concerns, particularly when combined with blockchain-based audit mechanisms. Gold-backed stablecoins capitalize on this timeless reliability, pairing physical gold’s enduring value with blockchain’s efficiency. By linking digital tokens directly to physical gold, they sidestep the speculative risks of cryptocurrencies and the inflationary pitfalls of government-issued money. Blockchain-enabled gold tokenization Blockchain technology removes the traditional obstacles to gold ownership by enabling fractional digital ownership and global trading without intermediaries. Physical gold stored in regulated vaults is digitized into tokens, each representing a precise fraction of the underlying asset. Every transaction is immutably recorded on a decentralized ledger, enabling investors to continuously check reserves in real time through automated smart contracts. This system overcomes gold’s historic limitations, including illiquidity and high storage costs, while eliminating the opacity of traditional reserve management. Merging gold’s tangible security with blockchain’s immutable record-keeping, the system also engineers trust directly into the architecture. This approach creates a stablecoin model unlike any other, where verifiable backing is the system’s backbone, not merely promised on paper. Creating stablecoins that truly deliver stability Gold-backed stablecoins merge blockchain’s inherent accountability with gold’s stability, establishing a new class of digital assets resistant to volatility. Anchoring digital tokens to gold’s intrinsic value, this model sidesteps the volatility of speculative cryptocurrencies and the inflationary risks of government-issued currencies. The result is a stablecoin engineered for trust, where stability isn’t promised by code or institutions — it’s bolstered by tangible scarcity and blockchain’s unyielding transparency. Trust as a cornerstone The primary challenge facing stablecoins is establishing user trust. This trust can’t be built solely on a company’s reputation. It must be earned through independently verifiable collateral, real-time audits and clear regulatory oversight. Innovative hybrid models showcase this approach effectively. The government strictly regulates and audits the gold reserves in a hybrid model to maintain verifiable 1:1 backing. The private entities handle token issuance, trading and compliance processes, carefully separating state verification of collateral from private management of operational functions. This public-private partnership ensures rigorous oversight without creating a central bank digital currency. As they divide responsibilities, the model establishes a system where the government guarantees authenticity and collateral integrity while private enterprises handle operational efficiency, ensuring a balanced and decentralized yet trustworthy environment. Toward a more trustworthy digital financial ecosystem Genuine stability in digital finance emerges not from marketing slogans but from transparent mechanisms and verifiable collateral. The future of digital finance lies in combining blockchain’s revolutionary transparency with the historically proven stability of gold, especially under government auditing and privately managed structures. As more asset-backed solutions emerge, institutions, regulators and everyday users will adopt stablecoins that transparently deliver on their stability promises. This evolution marks a pivotal shift. Investors will no longer accept vague assurances. Investors demand concrete stability. Gold-backed stablecoins, blending ancient reliability with blockchain innovation, will lead the next generation of digital financial instruments, ensuring stablecoins fulfill their original promise — stability without compromise.

The flagship cryptocurrency declined by more than 7% in the past 24 hours before making a slight recovery, trading in the low $80,000s at the time of writing.​ M2 Money Supply Surge May Help Bitcoin In an X post published today, crypto analyst Titan Of Crypto hinted that – despite the prevailing pessimism – a Bitcoin rally might be imminent following a surge in the global M2 money supply. The analyst shared a chart indicating how BTC has historically followed the M2 money supply with a slight lag. ​ For the uninitiated, ​the M2 money supply is a broad measure of the total money circulating in an economy, including cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near-money assets like savings accounts and small time deposits. Central banks monitor M2 to assess economic conditions and guide monetary policy decisions. As mentioned earlier, past data shows that BTC has a strong correlation with changes in the M2 money supply, often exhibiting a lag of approximately 70 to 107 days. For example, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, substantial increases in the M2 money supply due to stimulus measures were followed by significant Bitcoin rallies. ​ Fellow crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader echoed Titan’s sentiments. The trader shared a chart highlighting the reversal area in the M2 money supply, suggesting that if the correlation remains strong, similar behavior could be expected in BTC. Just A Healthy Pullback For BTC? While there is considerable concern surrounding BTC’s current sluggish price action – aligned with the declining global equity markets – some analysts view the current price pullback as a healthy correction rather than the end of the bull market.​ Bitcoin analyst Bitcoin Wukong shared their thoughts on the top cryptocurrency’s recent price action. In an X post published today, the analyst wrote:​ If you’re lost in the noise – zoom out. This pullback is just a correction following the Trump-driven rally, not the start of a bear market. Zooming out, the $66K–$73K zone still shows strong structural support. That said, BTC faces multiple strong resistance levels, as outlined by Titan Of Crypto in one of his recent analysis posts. The trader noted that BTC must overcome the Ichimoku Cloud resistance around the $88,000 price level.​ However, BTC managed to maintain bullish momentum with a positive March monthly candle close. At press time, BTC trades at $78,566, down 5% in the past 24 hours.​",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Rally|btc|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency|digital currency|M2 fractal|M2 Money Supply|US tariff,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ZK|WLD|CAKE|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-08 08:00:38

Analyst Says BTC’s Short-Term Future Hangs On These Levels",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-headed-to-69000-analyst-says-btcs-short-term-future-hangs-on-these-levels/,"The market volatility, fueled by the ongoing tariff war, saw Bitcoin (BTC) trade below the $75,000 mark for the first time since November. Despite recovering from the dip, the flagship crypto risks more short-term volatility if it doesn’t reclaim key support levels soon. Related Reading: XRP Confirms Head And Shoulders Breakdown: How Low Can It Go? Bitcoin Hits 5-Month Lows Bitcoin ended the week with a price drop below the $80,000 support zone, closing Sunday below the $78,500 mark. In the early hours of Monday, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization continued bleeding toward the $74,500 support zone before bouncing. Amid the 9.1% correction, Bitcoin registered its lowest trading price in five months, touching November 6 levels. Market watcher Daan Crypto Trades noted that BTC has been trading below its Bull Market Support Band for the past few weeks, attempting to get back above this level but ultimately facing rejection. According to the trader, “This is a good metric to gauge high timeframe market momentum. So far this cycle, price has traded below it shortly a few times (2023 & 2024) but never traded away from it for much more than ~20%,” suggesting that bull would like to reclaim this region. Analyst Rekt Capital noted that BTC’s current correction is “very close to equaling the retracement depth of the Post-Halving pullback of almost -33%.” The ongoing retrace has seen Bitcoin drop 31% since January’s all-time high (ATH) of $108,786. However, he considers that Bitcoin could bleed into the $70,000 support before hitting the correction’s bottom. “Whenever Bitcoin’s Daily RSI crashed into the sub-28 RSI levels – that wouldn’t necessarily mark out the price bottom. In fact, historically, the actual price bottom would be -0.32% to -8.44% lower than the price when the RSI first bottomed,” he explained, adding that Bitcoin is forming its second low, 2-79% below the first low. If it follows the same pattern and drops 8.44% below the first low, investors could see Bitcoin’s price bottom at around $69,000-$70,000. Another 10% Correction Ahead? Moreover, Rekt Capital outlined the key levels to reclaim after BTC’s weekly close below the $80,650 support. The analyst noted that Bitcoin already has “upside wicked into this level to tag it as potential new resistance” this week. As a result, it must recover last week’s close level if BTC wants to challenge 2025’s Weekly Downtrend, and it also needs to hold Sunday’s daily close level of $78,500. Bitcoin failed to Daily Close above the Downtrend. In fact, price continued to form new Lower Highs in its already extended series of Lower Highs. On the latest rejection, BTC landed into the ~$78,500 lows. Continue to hold this level as support, and BTC has a chance at challenging the $82,500 level in the short term. The analyst detailed that Bitcoin generally needs to close above the $78,500 level to “build a base here for a potential short-term rebound.” On the contrary, a daily close below this level would see BTC positioned for a bearish retest after closing below it for two consecutive days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Goes Beast Mode—Mining Power Tops 1 Zetahash In First-Ever Surge He concluded that “turning this level into a confirmed resistance would send price into additional downside continuation,” which targets the pre-halving highs price range between $69,000 and $72,000. As of this writing, BTC trades at $79,200, a 1% increase in the daily timeframe.

Set for 20-21 May 2025 at the prestigious Dar es Salaam Serena Hotel , this milestone event will be a catalyst for industry breakthroughs and will set the course for the future of iGaming in the region. Betting has been deeply embedded in Tanzania’s cultural fabric, long before the emergence of formal sports books and casinos. Over time, the industry has evolved, with land-based betting sparking excitement and paving the way for the booming online betting market. Today, Tanzania stands at the forefront of East Africa’s iGaming revolution, offering vast opportunities for innovation and growth. Key Insights from Our Chairperson, Thomas Buckley Opar Owuor Drawing from his experience in the region’s market, Thomas , Founder of Owuor Law and Chairperson of SBEA+ Summit 2025 , highlighted what makes Tanzania a key market for the sports betting industry: “The main reason it’s such an important market for the industry is that Tanzania is a trailblazer in many areas of gaming in Africa. [For instance], it was the first country in East Africa to establish written sports betting regulations. Ultimately, I think the Tanzanian gaming ecosystem makes it very easy for an operator or investor to have an impact on society, and there is also a lot of cross-governmental support for gaming operations.” In terms of technological developments the industry should be paying attention to, Thomas had the following to say: “More than anything, what’s interesting for me is the AI component, specifically regarding customer centricity and system efficiency. We’re looking at how it should make customer support easier–how AI can help operators attend to customer needs 24/7 and provide better answers consistently. Also, I see crypto, which is still a hot topic, being further integrated into sports betting.” Given the political and regulatory attention sports betting is receiving in East Africa, Thomas shared his take on the situation and its wider implications: “We’re seeing a lot of political and policing interventions coming through after the explosion of sports betting in East Africa. There tends to always be an increase in taxes and the argument that there are negative social consequences of sports betting that need to be mitigated, but I beg to differ. I believe that the problem the government tends to see is broader than that. I think both sports operators and regulators need to be in the room where these policies are being discussed.” Thomas also believes it’s important for governments, for example, to realise that many young people turn to sports betting because they don’t have many economic opportunities. He also believes that if the government continues to increase taxes, as they do in Kenya, it will only push the industry underground, leading to more offshore betting and money going overseas. There needs to be a balance. He added, “Bringing the conversation back to Tanzania, I think they are doing it right. They have a lot of robust discussions whenever there are changes to taxes or policies around betting.” Here’s why Thomas considers the SBEA+ Summit a must-attend event for every industry leader: “Dar es Salaam is a beautiful city with great people and great food. Tanzanians are also very tech-savvy and have a lot to teach anyone who ventures out to experience the retail and online sports betting scene. Aside from that, Tanzania’s record of being one of the first in organising gaming means there’s a lot to learn for regulators, investors, operators, marketers, and even community advocates around sports betting and how it should be done. These should be strong reasons for those in the industry not to miss the SBEA+ Summit 2025 in Dar es Salaam.” Celebrating Industry Excellence at the SBEA+ Summit Eventus Awards The Sports Betting East Africa+ Summit 2025 isn’t just about insightful discussions and networking—it’s also a stage for recognising visionaries and game-changers!

According to Ark’s latest trade filings, the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) purchased 64,806 Coinbase shares, worth around $10.2 million based on Monday’s closing price. Meanwhile, the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) picked up 19,708 shares, amounting to about $3.1 million. This comes after Ark Invest bought $13.4M worth Coinbase shares on Friday. Ark Invest Offloads $12.4M in Bitcoin ETF Shares Amid Market Volatility At the same time, Ark sold 159,496 shares of the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), worth roughly $12.4 million. Data from SoSoValue indicated the ARKB fund experienced net outflows of $4.69 million on the same day. As of Monday, Coinbase made up 5.92% of ARKW’s portfolio—ranking as its fourth-largest holding—and 7.65% of ARKF, making it the fund’s second-largest position, based on Ark’s most recent disclosure. Coinbase shares ended Monday down 2.04% at $157.28, but saw a 2.68% gain in after-hours trading, climbing to $161.50, according to Google Finance. Here’s what moves Cathie Wood and @ARKInvest made today 4/7 pic.twitter.com/hf0HRflInV — Ark Invest Daily (@ArkkDaily) April 8, 2025 The strategic buy occurred during a turbulent session across global markets. Asian equities suffered steep losses, with China’s Shanghai Composite down 7.3% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 sliding 7.8%. In the U.S., the Dow Jones fell 0.91% and the S&P 500 edged down 0.23%, while the Nasdaq eked out a 0.10% gain. Meanwhile, the crypto market also plunged on Monday. Bitcoin briefly dropped to around $74,300 but later rebounded to trade above $80,000, gaining 3.64% in the past 24 hours. Last week, Ark Invest also purchased Coinbase shares worth $13.4 million across three of its exchange-traded funds. ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) purchased 54,988 shares worth $8.8 million. Two other ETFs – the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and the Ark Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) – acquired 15,982 shares for $2.5 million and 12,187 shares for $2 million respectively. Crypto and U.S. Stocks Crash on Monday Cryptocurrency markets faced a brutal correction on what’s being dubbed “Black Monday,” with total liquidations exceeding $1.36 billion in the day. President Donald Trump recently unveiled a sweeping tariff package that includes a 25% levy on vehicle imports, a minimum 10% tariff on all imports, and “reciprocal tariffs” aimed at countries imposing duties on U.S. goods. These measures have rattled markets, leading to capital flight from riskier assets like crypto and a pivot toward safe-haven plays such as gold and the Japanese yen. As reported, over $1.2 billion of long bets were wiped out, with Bitcoin longs accounting for more than $392 million in losses. Crypto wasn’t alone in the selloff. U.S. stock futures also plunged Sunday night, heightening fears of a broader market crash. S&P 500 futures fell 5.98%, Nasdaq 100 futures slid 6.2%, and Dow futures dropped 5.5%, all pointing to a chaotic start to the trading week. Meanwhile, prominent hedge fund manager and Trump supporter Bill Ackman publicly urged the administration to pause the tariff escalation for 90 days, warning that the current trajectory could spark an “economic nuclear winter.” The post Ark Invest Scoops Up $13.3M in Coinbase Shares Amid Market Slump appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|ARK Invest|Coinbase,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-08 08:02:07

In its latest enforcement action against cryptocurrency crimes, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission confirmed in an April 8 statement that the Federal Court had approved its application to shut down the companies. According to the commission, the court agreed to wind them up on just and equitable grounds, with ASIC finding that most were registered using false information. The watchdog suspects the companies were part of coordinated scam operations, particularly linked to “ pig butchering ” schemes, where scammers build fake online relationships to earn victims’ trust before tricking them into investing in fraudulent crypto platforms. Justice Angus Stewart, who presided over the matter, described the case for winding up the companies as “overwhelming,” adding that there was a justifiable lack of confidence in their conduct and management. You might also like: Australian Federal Police warn of Binance impersonation scam targeting locals In a March 21 ruling reviewing 17 firms from the list, the court found a clear pattern of pig butchering scams linked to deceptive websites and apps. The Federal Court appointed Catherine Conneely and Thomas Birch of Cor Cordis as joint liquidators of the 95 firms. In their initial investigation, they found that only three companies held any assets, prompting a recommendation to deregister the remaining 92 immediately. The liquidators have since received nearly 1,500 claims from alleged victims across 14 countries, including Australia, the United States, Cameroon, Ghana, India, Nepal, the Philippines, and France. Reported losses exceed $35.8 million. ASIC believes many of the websites and mobile apps tied to the companies were designed to mimic legitimate trading platforms , tricking users into thinking their funds were being properly invested. In reality, the platforms were fake, and victims’ money was funnelled into accounts controlled by the offenders. “These companies were set up with the aim of providing a veneer of credibility,” said ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court, warning that “scammers will use every tool they can think of to steal people’s money and personal information.” ASIC has been targeting such fraud aggressively and has been taking down roughly 130 scam websites per week, according to the announcement. To date, the agency claims to have shut down over 10,000 malicious sites, including more than 7,200 fake investment platforms and 1,500 phishing scams. Last month, the agency also moved against crypto ATM operators , warning that those failing to comply with anti-money laundering rules would face legal action. AUSTRAC flagged a rise in suspicious transactions and scams tied to the machines, urging tighter oversight on Australia’s crypto ATM network.

With Pi Coin’s price crashing toward the $0.30 mark and the community growing impatient, criticism toward the PiCoreTeam (PCT) is mounting. Still, some dedicated users aren’t giving up just yet, urging fellow Pioneers to stay bullish and stick to the project. Price Drop Sparks Doubts Pi Coin has dropped by over 13% in recent days, falling to $0.58 and continuing on a downward trend. The drop has triggered fresh concerns among users, especially with many still waiting for the open mainnet to launch. Frustration also boiled over after delays in KYB approvals for community projects, with platforms like PiDaoSwap launching NFTs on Binance Smart Chain to bypass Pi’s slow internal processes. John Lang Calls for Patience Despite the growing negativity, Pi Network node runner John Lang took to X to defend the project. He emphasized that the PCT is working “meticulously behind the scenes” and reminded the community that building a global crypto platform is no small feat. “Their task is not easy,” Lang wrote. “Just trust the process and whatever the market condition is, never sell your Pi cheap.” Developer Push Behind the Scenes As a sign of ongoing progress, the PiCoreTeam recently rolled out technical requirements for developers. These include a mobile-first approach, mandatory KYC certification, and clear models for value exchange. The Pi SDK now supports applications involving virtual goods, mini-games, and decentralized services, aiming to revive the ecosystem with real utility. Community Still Active, But Concerns Remain Interestingly, the PCT noted that domain auctions on the Pi Network have surpassed 200,000 bids, showing that some users are still active on-chain. However, analysts like Dr Altcoin have warned that such activity isn’t enough. He’s pushing for the PCT to burn a significant amount of Pi Coins from its foundation wallets to ease inflation concerns. This week is crucial for the price of Pi, ahead of the upcoming influx of unlocked Pi coins to CEXs. If the Core Team does not make significant changes to its tokenomics and fails to announce major developments or partnerships by the end of this week, Pi is likely to plunge to… pic.twitter.com/XYovpjNYSU — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) April 7, 2025 Meanwhile, a pseudonymous figure named Satoshi Nakamoto proposed creating a community-driven liquidity pool (CDLP), where users commit to buying Pi monthly to stabilize its price. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market is Up Today?

A recent report by Singapore crypto payments firm Triple-A says this has increased to 24.4% in 2023. A poll of 1,006 Singaporeans reveals that the younger generations are leading the way. Gen Z (born 1997-2009) hold around 40% of cryptocurrency. Millennials (born 1981-1996) are not far behind at 39%. Gen X (born 1965-1980) and Baby Boomers (born 1946-1964) hold 19% and 9% respectively. Generational differences in Singapore’s crypto usage The Triple-A report indicates that there are strong trends in the adoption of cryptocurrency across different age groups in Singapore. The younger generations are likely to incorporate digital assets into their daily money-making endeavors. Among Gen Z and Millennial crypto holders (16-44 years old in 2025), e-commerce retailing leads the way with 41.1% using cryptocurrency to make e-commerce transactions. Bill payments come in second at 35.9%, where these young shoppers pay utility bills and subscription services in digital form. Third is in-store shopping at 27%. This indicates physical retail adoption is building steam among younger cohorts. Conversely, older generations between 1918 and 1980 have distinct preferences for their uses. This generation makes peer-to-peer transfers very frequently, with 42.9% of them applying cryptocurrency for purposes of friend-to-friend and family transfers alone. The younger generation shows a lower percentage of 38.7% for this kind of transfer. Internet shopping ranks second among older users at 35.7%, followed by bill payments and in-shop purchases with much lower percentages at 17.2% and 17%, respectively, than their younger counterparts. Remittance payments contain a fascinating trend: 33.6% of younger users are transacting cross-border using cryptocurrency, as opposed to only 25.1% of older users. This implies that younger Singaporeans are more at ease exploring remittance channels beyond the confines of conventional banking infrastructure. The most marked gap is in bill payments, in which younger customers (35.9%) are more than twice as probable as the older generations (17.2%) to use cryptocurrency. The gap suggests that younger customers may be more receptive to utilizing cryptocurrency for everyday financial obligations. Singapore crypto payment ecosystem sees growth Singapore’s crypto payment network has increased significantly. Almost US$1 billion (S$1.3 billion) worth of crypto was processed through merchant services during the second quarter of 2024. That is significantly greater than any previous quarterly total during the past two years, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. The rise in payment volume comes as more companies accept cryptocurrency. Some merchant collaborations include AXS, which works with Triple-A to enable app users to pay bills and top up using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, USD Coin, and Tether. Source: The Strait Times Charles & Keith fashion retailer has incorporated crypto payment choices on its online store, and Apple product reseller iStudio now accepts cryptocurrency at its brick-and-mortar stores. User incentives for taking up crypto payments show pragmatic concerns above investment interest. According to the Triple-A survey, 37% of respondents identified international acceptance as the most important advantage of cryptocurrency payments. Second on the list was the speed of transactions at 29%, and 20% valued lower fees, especially in cross-border transfers. But according to data, users too have some issues. These range from complexity of use, which ranked as the highest issue, with 63% of the respondents having found areas such as private key management hard to manage. Security issues came in a close second at 60%, while merchants’ limited acceptance is still a challenge for 54% of respondents. Singapore has accelerated crypto licensing Singapore’s expanding cryptocurrency usage operates within a progressively structured regulatory framework. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has accelerated its licensing of digital payment token (DPT) firms. It has granted a record 13 new licenses in 2024 itself. In spite of 2024 global technology sector job cuts, the future of Singapore’s blockchain jobs is bright. In a poll conducted by the Singapore FinTech Association (SFA), HQ.xyz, SG Builders, and Superteam, more than 75% of regional Web3 firms intend to hire more staff members in 2025. 60% of surveyed companies also intend to increase their staff by half or more. Currently, the local Web3 sector directly employs 2,433 individuals. The SFA attributes this hiring to growing institutional adoption, ongoing technological improvements, and expanding applications for blockchain technology. In-demand roles span various specialties, including partnerships, marketing strategy, sales, product management, and software engineering. The industry growth has also created opportunities in adjacent professional services such as legal, advisory, and consulting roles.

In a move that signals strong confidence in its future and commitment to its ecosystem, NKN, the innovative blockchain-based decentralized network connectivity protocol, has just announced a strategic token buyback program. This announcement, made via their official X account, has already sparked considerable interest and optimism within the crypto sphere. But what exactly does this mean for NKN and its users? Let’s dive deep into the details of this exciting development and explore its potential impact. Decoding the NKN Token Buyback Program: What’s the Buzz? At its core, a token buyback program is a mechanism where a project or company uses its own funds to repurchase its tokens from the open market. Think of it like a company buying back its own stock in traditional finance. In the context of crypto, a crypto buyback program like the one announced by NKN can serve several crucial purposes, all aimed at enhancing the health and sustainability of the project’s ecosystem. NKN’s announcement highlights a long-term vision, suggesting this isn’t a short-term pump, but a sustained effort to strengthen the foundations of their decentralized network . Here’s a breakdown of what we know so far about the NKN token buyback: Strategic Initiative: NKN is positioning this as a strategic, long-term program, indicating a well-thought-out plan rather than a reactive measure. Ecosystem Focus: The primary goal is to strengthen the NKN ecosystem. This implies the buyback is designed to benefit the project’s overall health and growth. Confidence Signal: A buyback program is often interpreted as a sign of confidence from the project team in the token’s intrinsic value and future potential. Why is NKN Implementing a Token Buyback? Exploring the Rationale Why would NKN choose to initiate a crypto buyback program now? There are several compelling reasons why this move makes strategic sense for the project: Reduce Token Supply: One of the most immediate effects of a token buyback is a reduction in the circulating supply of tokens. By taking tokens out of circulation, NKN aims to create scarcity, which can potentially lead to increased demand and upward pressure on the token price over time, benefiting long-term holders. Boost Token Value: As demand potentially increases against a reduced supply, the perceived value of the NKN token can be enhanced. This can attract new investors and further incentivize existing holders to remain invested in the project. Demonstrate Financial Strength: Implementing a buyback program requires financial resources. By allocating funds to repurchase tokens, NKN is signaling its financial stability and commitment to its token holders. This can boost investor confidence and trust in the project’s longevity. Support Ecosystem Growth: A healthier token economy can contribute to a more robust ecosystem. A stronger token price can incentivize node operators, developers, and other participants within the NKN network, fostering greater participation and contribution. Unpacking the Benefits: How Does the NKN Token Buyback Program Benefit You? The announcement of the NKN token buyback program is likely to bring a range of benefits to different stakeholders within the NKN ecosystem. Let’s break down some key advantages: For Token Holders: Potential Price Appreciation: Reduced supply and increased demand can lead to potential price appreciation, benefiting current holders. Increased Confidence: The buyback signals NKN’s confidence in its future, potentially increasing holder confidence and reducing selling pressure. Long-Term Value: The program is designed to strengthen the ecosystem long-term, potentially translating to sustained value for token holders. For the NKN Ecosystem: Stronger Network: A healthier token economy can incentivize greater participation in the network, leading to a more robust and resilient decentralized network . Attracts Developers and Partners: A thriving ecosystem and token can attract developers and partners, fostering innovation and growth within the blockchain NKN platform. Enhanced Project Sustainability: By strategically managing token supply and value, NKN can enhance the long-term sustainability and viability of the project. Navigating Potential Challenges and Considerations While the NKN token buyback program is a positive development, it’s important to also consider potential challenges and factors to keep in mind: Challenge/Consideration Description Market Conditions: The effectiveness of the buyback program can be influenced by overall market conditions. A bearish market could dampen the positive impact. Buyback Execution: The specific mechanics of the buyback (e.g., frequency, amount, price) will play a crucial role in its success. Transparency and consistent execution are key. Long-Term Strategy: The buyback is one component of a broader strategy. NKN’s continued development, adoption, and partnerships are equally important for long-term success. Community Expectations: The buyback may raise community expectations regarding price appreciation. Managing these expectations and focusing on long-term ecosystem growth is crucial. Actionable Insights for the NKN Community: What Should You Do? So, what should NKN token holders and the wider crypto community take away from this announcement? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on official NKN channels (X, website, community forums) for further details about the buyback program’s implementation and progress. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While the buyback is positive, continue to conduct thorough research on NKN’s technology, roadmap, team, and overall ecosystem to make informed decisions. Consider Long-Term Potential: The buyback program is a long-term initiative. Consider NKN’s long-term vision and potential within the decentralized connectivity space when evaluating your investment strategy. Engage with the Community: Participate in NKN community discussions to share your perspectives and stay updated on the project’s developments. Conclusion: A Strategic Boost for the NKN Ecosystem NKN’s announcement of a strategic token buyback program is undoubtedly a positive signal for the project and its community. It reflects a commitment to strengthening the NKN ecosystem , enhancing token value, and fostering long-term growth. While the crypto market remains dynamic and various factors can influence outcomes, this initiative demonstrates NKN’s proactive approach and confidence in its future. As the program unfolds, it will be crucial to monitor its execution and impact on the blockchain NKN network and the broader crypto landscape. This move could indeed be a significant step in solidifying NKN’s position as a leading player in decentralized network connectivity.

In a video update, the pseudonymous analyst tells his 209,000 YouTube subscribers that a combination of 200-week means suggests Bitcoin may soon enter an explosive uptrend based on historical precedent. The analyst says that the 200-week arithmetic and the 200-week geometric are currently close together on the chart, signaling a possible Bitcoin breakout. “It might be that the bull market is still forming and that the [arithmetic mean] will separate again, will diverge again, from the geometric mean. One more thing on those two lines. Notice that you can’t have a bear market or a big crash when the 200-week [arithmetic mean] and the geometric mean are together. The big crashes here [in 2021 and 2022] are happening when there’s a diversion between the two lines. Also, here in 2018, there was a big gap between the two [means]. Same here in 2014 and 2015.” Source: PlanB/YouTube The analyst says that when the two types of 200-week means were near each other on the chart in 2020 and 2017, Bitcoin soon went on explosive runs to the upside. “In fact, if we look at the historical situations where the lines are together, that would be here at the end of 2020; that’s when the bull market began. The end of the bull market, the FOMO (fear of missing out) phase. Same [thing] in the beginning of 2017, the lines were together. So [arithmetic mean] and geometric mean together could mean the bull market is about to start.” Bitcoin is trading for $80,641 at time of writing, up nearly 2% on the day.

The move aims to test its on-chain airdrop system while rewarding early supporters. Here’s how to qualify for the airdrop. WLFI Airdrop Plan For Eligible Holders On April 8, WLFI announced plans to distribute a small amount of its USD1 stablecoin to eligible WLFI token holders. The company described this as a “technical functionality test” designed to ensure the airdrop system works smoothly in a live environment. At the same time, it serves as a thank-you to early adopters. We just posted a new governance proposal: To test our airdrop functionality by distributing USD1 to all $WLFI holders — rewarding our earliest supporters and preparing for future growth. Join the discussion https://t.co/NDg5yMYUrM — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) April 7, 2025 WLFI, which launched in September, has already raised $550 million through token sales, and USD1 went live in March. The firm believes that a successful airdrop will boost visibility and awareness of its stablecoin before a full-scale rollout. “Testing the airdrop mechanism in a live setting is a necessary step to ensure smart contract functionality and readiness,” the company stated. How to Qualify for the Airdrop Although WLFI has yet to finalize the exact amount and date of the airdrop, the event will take place on Ethereum Mainnet and will be funded by the WLFI project. Investors hoping to benefit should hold WLFI tokens until the snapshot is taken. Historically, airdrop allocations have been based on the number of tokens held, meaning investors with larger WLFI holdings may receive a greater amount. Holding tokens in a non-custodial wallet instead of an exchange wallet could also increase eligibility. Political Concerns and Criticism Since its launch, WLFI has faced scrutiny due to its ties with Trump. Lawmakers have raised concerns about his financial involvement, warning that it could impact upcoming regulations such as the STABLE Act . Meanwhile, reports indicate that $390 million of the project’s funds have already been paid to DT Marks DEFI LLC, a Trump-linked entity. Although USD1 is backed by U.S. Treasuries and managed by custodian BitGo, WLFI’s governance token remains non-transferable, raising transparency concerns. Despite the backlash, WLFI continues pushing forward, positioning itself as a major player in the stablecoin market.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-08 09:16:37

Geopolitical tensions seem to be drawing attention back to Bitcoin ( BTC ), with Matrixport forecasting a potential rally like in 2015, when the yuan’s devaluation triggered a sell-off before BTC rebounded by the end of the year. In a recent research report on X, the analysts at the Singapore-based blockchain firm pointed out that the USD/CNY exchange rate is nearing key resistance levels, which could trigger a Bitcoin breakout as the yuan faces increasing pressure. 📊Today’s #Matrixport Daily Chart – April 8 2025 🔽 Bitcoin Poised for Rally as USDCNY Approaches Key Resistance #BTCETF #Matrixport #BTC #Crypto #market #trading $BTC #MarketTrends #RMB #USDCNY #Market #US pic.twitter.com/ZVgRV5Zt69 — Matrixport Official (@Matrixport_EN) April 8, 2025 Despite short-term concerns over U.S. Treasury yields, the analysts still appear to be optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term potential. “In 2015, following RMB devaluation, Bitcoin initially experienced a sell-off but concluded the year with significant strength. We may see a similar scenario unfold now, as parallels emerge with our bullish gold research from 18 months ago.” Matrixport You might also like: Bitcoin bleeds, stocks sink, and tariffs spike — is this the start of a global sell-everything moment? Geopolitical battle This all ties back to the broader U.S.- China tensions, with Beijing saying it will “fight to the end” over President Donald Trump ‘s threat of a 50% tariff on Chinese goods. The situation has gotten more heated, with Trump insisting on new tariffs unless China pulls back on its retaliatory measures, which already include 34% tariffs on U.S. goods. China has taken a strong stance, warning that more tariffs will just highlight the U.S.’s aggressive approach, which they call “blackmailing.” “The U.S. side’s threat to escalate tariffs against China is a mistake on top of a mistake, once again exposing the American side’s blackmailing nature.” A spokesman for China’s commerce ministry For Bitcoin, the growing geopolitical risk and a weaker yuan could create a good opportunity for growth, as investors look to crypto as a hedge against inflation and market uncertainty, the analysts suggest, adding that current prices “may be artificially suppressed,” but still “ready to surge upward rapidly.” Read more: Crypto markets on edge as Trump threatens historic tariff hike on China",News|Bitcoin|China|Donald Trump|Singapore|United States,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-08 09:17:19

The altcoins have marked substantial gains over the past 24 hours, with many posting double-digit price increases. BTC to Challenge $80K? What a week it has been for the crypto market. Bitcoin was riding high last Wednesday when it surged to $88,500 after reports that Elon Musk might leave US President Trump’s inner circle, but slumped hard in the following hours after the introduction of the latest set of tariffs from the US to the rest of the world. As every country was slapped with at least a 10% tax, BTC dumped toward $80,000 immediately. It bounced off and remained relatively still during most of the weekend at around $83,000, but started to lose value rapidly on Sunday evening and Monday morning. Its price slump took it to a five-month low of under $75,000, thus erasing over $12,000 in less than a week. After a fake report that the US might pause the tariffs for 90 days, BTC bounced off ot over $81,000 but dropped below $80,000 once again after the White House refuted the rumors and Trump actually warned China that he might add another 50% tax against it. For now, BTC has remained with notable 24-hour gains as its price stands above $79,000 after tapping $80,000 earlier today.

The Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF (XXRP) will list on NYSE Arca, offering twice the daily performance of XRP. Why a Leveraged ETF First? The fund comes amid growing momentum for XRP ETFs. Multiple issuers, including heavyweights like WisdomTree, Franklin Templeton, Canary Capital, and 21Shares, have already filed for such products, with all of them still under review by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In a post on X, Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas called the launch “very odd,” noting that leveraged products typically follow spot approvals. “Spot XRP still isn’t approved, though our odds are pretty high,” he added. The agency recently softened its stance on crypto following a reshuffle in its ranks instigated by Donald Trump’s victory in last year’s U.S. presidential election as well as a string of court losses. Last month, it decided to drop a long-running case against Ripple Labs, the creator of XRP. That settlement , which included a reduced fine of $50 million for Ripple, cleared a major hurdle for the crypto company and likely improved the chances for the approval of a spot ETF product tracking its native token. Teucrium’s fund targets short-term traders with a 1.85% management fee. The filing struck a cautious tone, highlighting risks like XRP’s volatility and declining performance . Demand for the product remains unclear, with Ethereum ETFs largely struggling as institutions still heavily focus on Bitcoin. XRP Price Action: A Mixed Bag As XRP gets ready to hit the market, the asset continues to show a mixed price trend. At press time, the token was trading at $1.87, posting a 7% gain over the past 24 hours. However, the short-term uptick failed to hide poor performances across different timeframes, with XRP slipping 11.2% in the last seven days. Furthermore, over the past two weeks, the asset fell 23%, while also losing nearly 20% of its value in the last month. Compared to the broader crypto market, which is down 8.2% after being caught on the wrong end of the aftereffects of President Trump’s new trade policies, XRP’s losses are slightly steeper. Still, on a yearly scale, the token is up by an impressive 215%, buoyed in part by favorable legal outcomes and the growing ETF speculation.

However, it did dip under $75,000 before recovering. That said, $80,000 is now horizontal resistance. Can Bitcoin get back above? A recovery on the way? According to a recent YouTube video on the Raoul Pal The Journey Man channel, macro economist Pal and his colleague Julien Bittel agree that financial conditions will ease into the rest of 2025. They say that various lagging indicators are pointing to a recovery for U.S. equities and crypto which could start in the next few weeks. Their forecast could be right or wrong of course, and even if right, the view is entirely a macro one, and so volatility over the short term can be expected. $80,000 becoming resistance Source: TradingView Looking at the $BTC price , it could be argued that it has held up comparatively well, and even though it did fall under $75,000 at one point on Monday, the price has recovered. The current situation is that Monday’s daily candle did close underneath the $80,000 support, thereby flipping it into resistance. As can be seen in the 8-hour chart above, the bulls are trying to get back above this level, but the candle wicks to the upside show that the bears are forcing the price back down. It may well be that further fall out from the Trump tariffs does eventually lead to capitulation down to the top of the previous bull market at $69,000. The orange line at the bottom of the chart shows how close this is now. Rapid descent to $69,000 could be likely Source: TradingView The weekly chart for Bitcoin shows how the price is attempting to break down underneath the $80,000 support. A weekly candle close beneath this level would be more serious for the bulls, and would suggest that a descent to $71,000 through to $69,000 would be quite likely, given that there is no support until these levels. With the majority of short term holders underwater even now, a drop to $69,000 could be a real capitulation event with many retail investors fleeing the market in fear. Nevertheless, this could be an excellent opportunity for those seeking to buy what could potentially turn out to be a bottom. Eight months of tortuous sideways price action, allied to the tops of the last bull market, make this level extremely strong. Be that as it may, a confirmed break beneath would definitively spell the end of the bull market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While BTC’s dip below $75k sparked widespread anxiety, the crypto’s resurgence has invoked enthusiasm and confidence. Analysts like Michael van de Poppe and Gert van Lagen believe that Bitcoin will continue its bullish rally. Bitcoin Price Surges 6%, Here’s Why After dipping below $75,000 yesterday, Bitcoin saw a significant uptrend, with its price breaking past $80,000. Over the past 24 hours, the crypto has seen a substantial hike of about 6%. Analyst Michael van de Poppe acknowledges this uptick as a “strong sign.” In his latest X post, van de Poppe expresses his confidence in the long-term potential of the Bitcoin price. Though he remains unclear about BTC’s next move, he cited, “However, with the amount of liquidity being added, 6 & 12 months from now prices will be substantially higher.” Notably, the sudden reversal of the last day’s negative trend is primarily driven by the speculations of the Federal Reserve’s potential interest rate cuts. Experts believe that the Fed will reduce interest rates due to the concerns surrounding Donald Trump’s tariff announcement. Bitcoin Price Rally To Sustain? Expert Insights As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at $79,348, marking a notable surge of 5.3% in a day. Despite this daily surge, BTC has declined by 5.5% and 7.9% over the past week and month, respectively. Interestingly, the prevailing positive momentum is clearly visible in the growing investor sentiment. The 24-hour trading volume of Bitcoin has increased by 12.57%, currently at $71.21 billion. According to analysts like Gert van Lagen, BTC is maintaining its bullish market trend. The expert identified that the Bitcoin price bounced off the neckline of a 4-year old Inverse Head & Shoulders pattern. This indicates BTC’s potential upside target of about $300k. $BTC [1W] is continuing its bull market after bouncing off the neckline of this 4-year-old iH&S, targeting ~$300k. Yesterday the bull market support at $74.8k was tested. Invalidation: weekly close — Update pic.twitter.com/gglOcKofzC — Gert van Lagen (@GertvanLagen) April 8, 2025 Van Lagen added that the crypto’s bull market support at $74,800 was tested yesterday, holding as a key level. A weekly close below this level could invalidate this bullish outlook. What Lies Ahead? This week kicked off negatively, with the global financial landscape experiencing a major collapse. The stock market saw a severe downturn, marking its largest crash since 2020. Mirroring the trend, the Bitcoin price also plummeted to its four-month low. However, as BTC has managed to recover from its recent crash, analysts and traders remain optimistic about its future path. Analyst Crypto Caesar forecasts the Bitcoin price’s continued bullish trend, with the focus kept on its all-time high of $108k.

Cosmos historic price sentiment Cosmos price history Cosmos, created by Ethan Buchman and Jae Kwon, launched its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2017, with the network officially going live two years later in 2019. During the bullish market cycle of 2021, Cosmos saw its price peak at over $44, driven by significant investor interest and market optimism. However, following this surge, on 3rd April 2022, the price of Cosmos (ATOM) sharply declined to $6.39. Since then, Cosmos entered a prolonged phase of consolidation, trading within a range between $6.39 and $16 as market dynamics fluctuated. In early 2024, particularly around 8th March, Cosmos encountered significant resistance at the $13 level, struggling to gain momentum above this point. This resistance reflected broader market sentiment and potential selling pressure. By July 2024, ATOM’s price was trading in a narrower range, between $5 and $6, indicating a lack of upward momentum. By August 2024, the price had further dipped to $4.02, suggesting increasing bearish pressure. This recent decline highlights ongoing challenges for Cosmos in maintaining its price stability and suggests potential further downside as market bears dominate, putting pressure on potential buyers to defend against a continued downward trend. On September 2024, the Cosmos price ranged between $4 to $5, and on October 06, the price traded at $4.5837 with a trading volume of $48.48M. On November 5, ATOM was trading at $4.10. By December 5, ATOM’s price surged significantly, trading at $10. Cosmos ATOM surged to $9 at the start of December 2024, but it declined to $9.6 and closed the year at $6.3. In January 2025, Cosmos peaked at $7.77, and in February, it’s trading between $4.54 and $4.86. ATOM value decreased further in March as it dipped to the $4.0 to $4.2 range.

A new report from Ripple and Boston Consulting Group projects the tokenized asset market could reach $18.9 trillion by 2033, while asset management giant Franklin Templeton has led an $8 million seed round in Cap, a startup aiming to launch a decentralized, interest-bearing stablecoin. Tokenized Asset Market Poised for Explosive Growth, Could Hit $18.9 Trillion by 2033, Says Ripple-BCG Report The global market for tokenized financial instruments—commonly referred to as real-world assets (RWAs)—could surge to a staggering $18.9 trillion by 2033, according to a new joint report from Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and blockchain infrastructure giant Ripple. The report marks a major inflection point in the digital asset industry, suggesting tokenization is approaching a ”tipping point” driven by accelerating institutional adoption, evolving regulations, and maturing technology. The forecast, which anticipates an average compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 53%, reflects a middle-of-the-road scenario between a conservative estimate of $12 trillion and an optimistic $23.4 trillion in tokenized assets over the next eight years. Such growth would mark a profound transformation in how traditional financial markets operate—ushering in an era of programmable money, 24/7 liquidity, and radically improved efficiency. Tokenization —the process of digitally representing ownership of real-world assets like bonds, real estate, or commodities on a blockchain—is no longer theoretical. It has become one of the most compelling use cases for blockchain technology, attracting attention from major traditional financial institutions seeking cost reductions and enhanced liquidity. “[The] technology is ready, regulation is evolving, and foundational use cases are in the market,” said Martijn Siebrand, Digital Assets Program Manager at Dutch banking giant ABN AMRO. JPMorgan's Kinexys platform, for instance, has already processed over $1.5 trillion in tokenized transactions and is seeing more than $2 billion in daily volume. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, issued in collaboration with Securitize, is approaching $2 billion in assets under management (AUM), gaining traction as a go-to tool for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Early Successes: Bonds, Treasuries, and Liquidity On-Demand Among the most mature use cases are tokenized government bonds and US Treasuries. These instruments are being utilized by corporate treasurers to manage idle cash in real time—moving funds into short-term government bonds directly from digital wallets without the need for intermediaries. The report also highlights private credit as a sector ripe for disruption. By making traditionally illiquid and opaque credit instruments accessible on-chain, tokenization offers investors transparent pricing and fractional ownership, democratizing access to markets that were once the domain of institutions only. Carbon markets are another promising frontier. Blockchain-powered registries could enhance transparency, traceability, and auditability of carbon credits—an increasingly important feature as companies face mounting regulatory pressure to prove environmental compliance. Despite the positive trajectory, the report outlines five critical barriers preventing widespread adoption: Fragmented Infrastructure – Most tokenized assets operate in closed systems, limiting network effects and scalability. Limited Interoperability – Lack of standardized protocols prevents seamless communication between platforms. Uneven Regulatory Progress – Regulatory clarity is inconsistent across jurisdictions, slowing global adoption. Custody Complexities – There’s no universal standard for how tokenized assets should be held and secured. Smart Contract Fragmentation – A lack of uniformity in smart contract designs hampers widespread use. As a result, many tokenized transactions remain reliant on off-chain components for final settlement, diminishing the very efficiency gains that blockchain technology promises. For example, delivery-versus-payment (DvP) capabilities, which are critical for unlocking secondary market liquidity, remain largely underdeveloped across most platforms. Global Legal Landscape: A Tale of Two Worlds On the legal and regulatory front, the report emphasizes a clear divide. Countries like Switzerland, Singapore, the EU, and the UAE have established progressive frameworks for tokenized securities, laying the groundwork for innovation and cross-border integration. In contrast, regulatory regimes in India and China remain restrictive or ill-defined, forcing institutions to navigate a patchwork of compliance requirements and tailor infrastructure on a per-jurisdiction basis. BCG and Ripple segment the evolution of tokenization into three distinct phases: Foundational Phase – Low-risk adoption of familiar instruments such as government bonds and funds. Expansion Phase – Broadening into complex financial products like private credit and tokenized real estate. Transformation Phase – Full-scale tokenization of illiquid markets including infrastructure and private equity. Currently, most institutional players remain in the first or second phase. However, achieving the third stage—full market transformation—will depend heavily on resolving interoperability issues, standardizing smart contracts, and harmonizing regulatory frameworks. Tokenization: A Cost-Saving Catalyst The report suggests that cost is becoming less of a barrier for institutions. Focused pilot projects can now be launched for less than $2 million, while comprehensive platforms that handle issuance, custody, trading, and compliance can range up to $100 million for large-scale financial institutions. Tokenization offers significant cost savings across a variety of functions. Processes like bond issuance, real estate fund tokenization, and collateral management can be streamlined through smart contracts, reducing administrative overhead and accelerating settlement timelines. While the promise of tokenization is immense, the report also comes with a cautionary note. ”Without industry-wide coordinated action, the same silos and fragmentation tokenization seeks to eliminate could reemerge in digital form,” warned Jorgen Ouaknine, Global Head of Innovation and Digital Assets at Euroclear, a leading financial market infrastructure provider. To avoid this pitfall, the report calls for collaborative action among financial institutions, technology providers, and regulators to establish universal standards and open architectures. Franklin Templeton Backs Cap’s Vision of a Yield-Bearing Stablecoin With $8M Seed Investment In other news, global asset manager Franklin Templeton has led an $8 million seed funding round into Cap, a blockchain startup developing a next-generation interest-bearing stablecoin and accompanying lending platform. The round also included backing from heavyweights like Susquehanna, Triton Capital, Nomura’s crypto arm Laser Digital, and market maker GSR—cementing Cap’s position at the intersection of traditional finance and cutting-edge crypto infrastructure. This institutional backing comes hot on the heels of a $1.1 million community round raised on the crowdfunding platform Echo, created by crypto personality Jordan “Cobie” Fish. Cap also counts among its early supporters a cadre of influential crypto angels including Spencer Noon, LayerZero founder Bryan Pellegrino, Blockworks co-founder Jason Yanowitz, and prominent investors connected to EtherFi, Steakhouse Financial, and Meteoria. At the core of Cap’s offering is cUSD, a stablecoin minted by depositing USDC or USDT. Unlike traditional stablecoins that sit idle, cUSD can be staked to earn yield derived from real-world institutional borrowing. The protocol is architected around EigenLayer’s shared security model, allowing Cap to tap into Ethereum’s restaking ecosystem for both security and scalability. Though transactions ultimately settle on Ethereum mainnet, Cap has aligned its growth strategy with MegaETH, an Ethereum Layer 2 still in its early days but designed as a technically superior alternative to rollup-centric solutions. MegaETH is built to optimize for real-time applications with low latency and high throughput, making it a natural home for an ambitious project like Cap. A New Yield Paradigm: Borrowing From the Crowd Cap’s yield-bearing mechanics are strikingly different from legacy systems. Rather than setting fixed interest rates, the protocol “outsources” yield generation to a decentralized network of operators, ranging from high-frequency trading firms and private equity shops to DeFi protocols and real-world asset platforms. These operators borrow cUSD from minters and stake providers to execute yield-generating strategies, creating a market-determined interest rate reflective of actual capital demand. Institutions like Franklin Templeton—now an investor in the protocol—can themselves become borrowers, tapping into Cap’s decentralized lending pool while offering yield to crypto-native lenders. The protocol charges a 10% fee on yield generated, while users retain the rest. Additionally, Cap introduces a safeguard in the form of loan insurance, which ensures that depositors are repaid even in the case of borrower defaults. While Cap’s architecture offers the promise of truly decentralized money markets, the team is not shy about acknowledging the risks. “Novel opportunities do not come without risk,” Cap’s team wrote in a recent blog post, listing several points of exposure: dependency on EigenLayer’s restaking mechanism, potential depegs of its cUSD stablecoin, bridge vulnerabilities if cUSD is used off Ethereum, and inherent smart contract risks stemming from the protocol’s non-custodial nature. These warnings are timely, especially as regulators in the US inch closer to comprehensive stablecoin legislation. Lawmakers have expressed particular concern around interest-bearing stablecoins, arguing that such instruments may blur the line between a stable digital dollar and unregulated securities. Cap’s structure—while technically innovative—could soon face legal scrutiny depending on how forthcoming bills address yield-generating dollar-pegged assets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-08 09:30:00

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now drawing Cardano (ADA)’s incredible 20,670.96% 8-year return comparisons. It is currently in Phase 4 of its 11-stage presale and has already secured $6,300,000 from 7,900 different investors, indicating soaring demand. Currently priced at $0.025, MUTM will jump 20% to $0.03 in Phase 5, which current participants expect to see a listing of the token on exchanges at $0.06, a 140% gain. Analysts are now questioning of whether this DeFi token could provide ADA’s mythical returns in months instead of years, backed by its lending utilities and institutional buy pressure. MUTM Presale Continues as Mutuum Finance Grows The presale for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 4 as it makes significant progress with investors battling to secure tokens before the price reaches the next level. The fixed 20% increase per phase in the project’s tokenomics translates into time-only profits for today’s purchasers once Phase 5 launches. Tokens bought at the listing price of $0.06 would earn a 140% return when launched. The post-launch estimates, meanwhile, take it to $3.50—a 13,900% increase—backs fueled by Mutuum Finance’s revenue-driven buybacks and growing lending sphere. What sets the protocol apart from its speculative peers is its mtTokens, which earn interest over time, and its overcollateralized loan structure. Mutuum Finance by funneling the fees of the platform into MUTM purchases, all while creating recurring demand, results in an incentive to hold it long term. A $100,000 freebie for early bird participants only adds to the FOMO, with investors racing to win an opportunity at the last low-value rounds before listings on exchanges commence. Cardano (ADA) Always Set the Bar Cardano (ADA) has been another crypto landmark, its mind-numbing 20,670.96% growth between 2017 and 2025 pointing to the benefits of early adoption. But its arc stretched over eight years — a schedule that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) seeks to shorten considerably. If the proof-of-stake model of ADA turned blockchain efficiency on its head, the real-world lending applications of MUTM and built-in scarcity mechanisms provide an accessible primary value vector. The presale structure of MUTM — which gradually pushes prices up in increments — could mean gains for investors could outpace ADA’s more organic market driven price adjustment, analysts find. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Close to Successful Auditing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to evolve ahead of launch, with security being one of the cornerstones of the project. The team is finalizing a smart contract audit with CertiK, a progression expected to instill investor confidence. Results will be widely shared through official channels, adding yet another layer of transparency once completed. Combined with the revenue-sharing plan integrated into the project and the versatility of mtToken, this makes the MUTM an antifragile cog in the wheel of decentralized finance. Timing the Market Shift Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just duplicating past success — it’s reinventing it. As Phase 4 slots are limiting, the opportunity to grab tokens under $0.03 is closing. Every presale step increases urgency — hesitating to secure assets at a discount could mean forgoing a 20% appreciation per phase. For context, a $1,000 investment today could yield $140,000 if launch target of $3.50 is then reached — and if we’re comparing to average market returns. While Cardano (ADA) loyalists once spoke skeptically of its potential yield as it soared; Mutuum Finance (MUTM) faces the same suspicion. But its presale momentum and planned scarcity hint at something different — a future where practicing patience isn’t the key to profits. As DeFi matures past speculation, the utility and tokenomics combination behind MUTM and its ecosystem may provide a template for rapid and sustainable growth. Last Chance to Get the Early Advantage As Phase 4 progresses and CertiK audits are awaited, the project embraces a dual approach of innovation while maintaining an accountable stance. For investors, the equation is simple: the $0.025 token of today may soon repeat Cardano’s run to the moon—in a fraction of the time. Waiting risks losing ground in a market where timing is everything.

Here’s where this price level is currently situated. Ethereum Has Only Realized Price Of Mega Whales To Rely On Now In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, analyst MAC_D has discussed about where the next major support level could lie for Ethereum. The line in question is a version of the Realized Price. The “Realized Price” is an on-chain indicator that, in short, keeps track of the average cost basis of investors belonging to a given ETH cohort. When this metric is under the spot price, it means the average member of the group is holding coins at a net loss. On the other hand, it being above the asset’s value suggests the cohort as a whole is in a state of net profit. Related Reading: Bitcoin Keeps Rebounding—But Is Momentum Really Turning Bullish? Investor cost basis is considered an important topic in on-chain analysis, as holders can be more likely to show some kind of move when their profit-loss status is challenged. Whether investors react by buying or selling can come down to which direction the retest of their acquisition level is occurring from. When it’s from above, holders may decide to accumulate more if the atmosphere is bullish, as they can consider the pullback to be just a ‘dip.’ This provides support to the asset, thus defending their cost basis. Similarly, investors who were underwater just prior to the retest might believe the surge wouldn’t last and they would fall back into losses again. So, they could make the decision to exit, to at least escape with their entire investment back. A cost basis level that has shown particular importance for not just Ethereum, but digital assets in general is the Realized Price of the entire network. As the chart shared by the quant shows, this level is currently situated around $2,250 for ETH. From the graph, it’s apparent that the line provided support to Ethereum last year, but it has failed recently as the coin’s price has significantly fallen under it. This means that the average holder on the blockchain is now sitting on a notable loss. With this major level gone, the Realized Price of the individual cohorts could help point to where the next support could be. Here is a chart displaying the trend in the indicator for investors holding between 100 to 1,000 ETH, 1,000 to 10,000 ETH, 10,000 to 100,000 ETH, and more than 100,000 ETH: As is visible in the graph, Ethereum has put three of the cohorts underwater with the latest crash. Now, only the largest of holders in the sector, those with over 100,000 ETH in their balance, are still in the green. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $0.57 Or $0.06? Analyst Says DOGE’s Fate Hinges On This Level Back in the 2022 bear market, ETH found support at the Realized Price of these humongous whales. Thus, it’s possible that this line could once again be of relevance to ETH. At present, the cohort has its average acquisition level at $1,290, so it will take more bearish action before a retest can take place. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,500, down more than 16% in the last 24 hours.

According to Farina, any significant increase in XRP’s value will not come from “imaginary lines on a chart” but rather from a combination of institutional adoption and scarcity. Let’s get this straight: $XRP won’t hit $100+ because of some imaginary lines on a chart. It will happen due to Institutional Adoption and scarcity. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) April 7, 2025 His comments come as analysts and crypto enthusiasts continue to present bullish technical projections for XRP, but Farina’s position highlights a more fundamental approach. He sees the growing infrastructure around the digital asset as the driver of future growth. The End of the SEC Lawsuit Ripple’s long-standing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently concluded, as both parties have dropped their appeals. Ripple’s initial $125 million penalty was reduced to $50 million. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse emphasized that the lawsuit’s conclusion opens up renewed opportunities in the U.S. financial sector. The resolution is pivotal for the digital asset’s legitimacy and growth prospects, especially as it removes one of the top regulatory uncertainties weighing on the asset for years. ETF Prospects and Institutional Demand In addition to legal clarity, the potential for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) is increasingly being considered as a near-term catalyst. Meanwhile, the SEC has already acknowledged multiple filings for an XRP ETF. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While no approval has been granted yet, many market observers expect a decision to come this year. If approved, an XRP ETF would provide regulated exposure for large-scale investors and asset managers, potentially accelerating institutional inflows. Farina’s view aligns with this broader shift toward utility-driven valuation. Institutional participation in digital assets generally requires regulatory clarity and compliant investment vehicles, both of which are beginning to emerge for XRP. Scarcity and Supply Constraints Farina also emphasized the role of scarcity, implying that XRP’s capped supply and the desire of institutional investors to accumulate tokens could lower the publicly available supply over time. Farina has previously referenced this upcoming supply shock, predicting it will liquidate 95% of token holders . With the lawsuit behind it, the prospect of an ETF ahead, and growing institutional interest, XRP is entering a new phase—one defined by infrastructure and adoption rather than speculation.

The case is part of the broader crackdown that led to executive arrests and Binance's March 2024 exit from Nigeria. Meanwhile, Australia’s securities regulator ASIC shut down 95 companies involved in crypto “pig butchering” scams, and exposed more than $35 million in global losses. In Spain, authorities shut down a $20 million AI-driven crypto scam that used deepfake ads and fake personas to defraud over 200 victims. Nigerian Court Delays Binance Tax Case A Nigerian court postponed its high-profile tax evasion case against Binance until April 30, giving the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) more time to respond to a request from the crypto exchange. The delay happened after a legal challenge by Binance’s lawyer, Chukwuka Ikwuazom, who argued in court on April 7 that the order allowing court documents to be served to Binance via email should be voided. According to Ikwuazom, since Binance does not have a registered office in Nigeria and is domiciled in the Cayman Islands, the FIRS did not have proper court authorization to serve documents outside of the country. Binance is facing a $2 billion tax claim from the FIRS, which also seeks $79.5 billion in damages for alleged harm to Nigeria’s economy. Authorities accused the exchange of contributing to the instability of the national currency, the naira, which is a claim Binance strongly rejected. FIRS also believes that Binance has a “significant economic presence” in Nigeria and is liable for corporate income taxes for 2022 and 2023. The agency is demanding back taxes along with penalties of 10% annually on unpaid amounts and nearly 27% in interest. The tax battle started after a broader crackdown on Binance’s operations in Nigeria, which intensified in early 2024 with the arrests of executives Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla on charges of tax fraud and money laundering. Although tax charges were dropped against both men in June, other charges against Gambaryan were only dismissed in October. Anjarwalla escaped custody and fled to Kenya, where he is still at large. Gambaryan, a US citizen, returned home after suffering serious health issues during detention, including pneumonia, malaria, and a herniated spinal disc. Binance exited the Nigerian market in March of 2024 by halting naira deposits and withdrawals. Australia Targets Pig Butchering Scam Rings Legal battles with the crypto sector are also being fought in other parts of the world. Australia’s corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), received court approval to shut down 95 companies suspected of operating crypto investment and romance scams known as “pig butchering.” Statement (Source: ASIC ) A crypto pig butchering scam is a type of long-term investment scam where fraudsters build fake relationships with victims online to gain their trust. Once the target is emotionally invested, the scammer slowly ”fattens them up” (like fattening a pig for slaughter) by encouraging them to invest in what appears to be a legitimate cryptocurrency platform. These platforms are actually controlled by the scammers. At first, the victim may even see fake profits to build confidence. Eventually, the scammer steals all the funds, and when the victim tries to withdraw, they either get blocked or are asked to pay fake fees or taxes. The Federal Court of Australia granted ASIC’s request on just and equitable grounds, after the watchdog discovered that most of the companies were registered using false information and were likely established to deceive victims under the guise of providing legitimate services. Judge Angus Stewart , who presided over the case, noticed a pattern of “pig butchering” behavior across the companies, and referred to findings from 48 misconduct reviews involving 17 of the firms. ASIC believes a big portion of this scam activity originates from Southeast Asia. Catherine Conneely and Thomas Birch of Cor Cordis have been appointed as joint liquidators of the companies. Provisional liquidators already received close to 1,500 claims from victims across 14 countries, totaling more than $35.8 million. These countries include Australia, the United States, Cameroon, Ghana, India, Nepal, the Philippines, and France. Only three of the 95 companies had any assets, which led liquidators to recommend the immediate winding up and deregistration of the remaining 92 firms. ASIC also ramped up its efforts to dismantle online scam operations, and even remove around 130 scam websites each week. These include more than 7,200 fake investment platform scams and over 1,500 phishing scams. Despite these efforts, ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court compared the scams to hydras —shut down one, and more emerge—and also warned consumers that the risk of scams and identity fraud remains high. On the bright side, Australia’s National Anti-Scam Centre recently reported a 26% drop in scam losses to $2 billion in 2024. This was accompanied by a 17.8% decrease in scam reports to 494,732. Fraud Ring Exposed in Spain In Spain, authorities arrested six people linked to a sophisticated global investment scam that used artificial intelligence to steal more than $20 million from at least 208 victims. According to a statement from Spanish police on April 7, the scammers defrauded their victims in multiple stages by using deepfake ads featuring well-known national figures to lure people into high-return cryptocurrency investments that were entirely fraudulent. Once victims invested and realized that they couldn’t withdraw their funds, the scammers launched follow-up cons, contacting them again while posing as investment managers. They claimed the victims’ funds were frozen and could be recovered for a fee, which many paid in hopes of retrieving their lost money. A third wave of deception followed, with scammers pretending to be Europol agents or UK-based lawyers, offering to return the stolen assets in exchange for supposed taxes owed in the countries where the funds were allegedly blocked. Spanish police said the scammers used AI algorithms to target specific people whose online profiles matched criteria that were set by the fraudsters. They then placed ads across websites and social media promising zero-risk crypto investments. The group is also accused of impersonating financial advisers and even fabricating romantic connections to build trust with the victims. The arrested individuals now face charges of fraud, money laundering, and falsifying documents as part of a criminal organization. During a raid on the home of the suspected ringleader, authorities seized a number of electronic devices, a simulated weapon, and extensive documentation. It is also believed that the group used dozens of fake companies to move the stolen funds and relied on false identities to evade detection. One member even allegedly used more than 50 different identities. Investigations are ongoing, and additional suspects were identified in other countries.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-08 09:34:31

That’s essentially what happened in the crypto world recently! A dormant Bitcoin wallet , untouched for a decade, suddenly sprang to life, moving a substantial amount of Bitcoin. This isn’t just any transaction; it’s a fascinating glimpse into the early days of crypto and the incredible gains that early adopters have witnessed. Decade-Old Dormant Bitcoin Wallet Awakens According to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, a dormant Bitcoin wallet that had been inactive for ten years decided to make a move. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Lookonchain revealed that this wallet transferred all 365 BTC it held to a new address. What makes this event truly noteworthy? The sheer value of those Bitcoins today. Let’s break down the key details: The Transaction: A dormant Bitcoin wallet transferred 365 BTC to a new address. Dormancy Period: The wallet had been inactive for 10 years. Source of Information: The information was reported by Lookonchain, a reputable on-chain analytics platform. Current Value: The 365 BTC is currently valued at a staggering $29 million. Original Value: Ten years ago, when the BTC was received, it was worth a mere $284 per coin. This movement from a dormant bitcoin wallet highlights the long-term investment potential of Bitcoin and the life-changing wealth accumulation it has enabled for some early believers. The Incredible Journey of Bitcoin Price Over a Decade To truly grasp the magnitude of this bitcoin transfer , let’s take a quick trip down memory lane and look at the journey of bitcoin price over the last decade. Back in 2014, Bitcoin was still in its nascent stages. It was a time of exploration, skepticism, and for those with foresight, immense opportunity. Consider this: Year Approximate Bitcoin Price (USD) Key Events 2014 $284 (at the time of receipt for this wallet) – Peaked around $900+ Mt. Gox Collapse, growing awareness of Bitcoin 2017 Reached ~$20,000 2017 Bull Run, mainstream media attention, ICO boom 2021 Reached ~$69,000 Institutional adoption, COVID-19 pandemic, DeFi and NFT surge 2024 (Present) ~$79,000+ Anticipation of Bitcoin halving, continued institutional interest, ETF approvals As you can see from the table, the bitcoin price has experienced significant volatility and growth over the years. For someone who held onto their Bitcoin since 2014, the patience has paid off in an unimaginable way. The $284 value per coin back then seems almost unbelievable compared to today’s prices! Why Do Dormant Crypto Wallets Suddenly Activate? The activation of a dormant crypto wallet after such a long period naturally raises questions. What could be the reasons behind such a move? While we can only speculate in this specific case, here are some common reasons why dormant wallets might become active: Lost Keys Found: Sometimes, individuals who bought Bitcoin early might have forgotten about their holdings or misplaced their private keys. The rediscovery of these keys can lead to the activation of a previously dormant crypto wallet . Estate Planning/Inheritance: In some instances, the original owner of the wallet might have passed away, and the Bitcoin is being moved as part of estate settlement or inheritance. Profit Taking: The most straightforward reason is profit-taking. After witnessing substantial price appreciation, holders of dormant bitcoin wallets might decide to finally sell their assets and realize their gains. Security Concerns: Long-term storage of crypto, especially on older wallets, might raise security concerns. Moving funds to a newer, potentially more secure wallet could be a precautionary measure. Strategic Portfolio Rebalancing: Large holders of Bitcoin might be rebalancing their portfolios, moving funds between different wallets for strategic reasons related to security, tax optimization, or diversification. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin and Crypto Market? While the movement of 365 BTC from a dormant bitcoin wallet is an interesting event, its direct impact on the broader bitcoin news and crypto market is likely minimal. However, it does serve as a powerful reminder of several key aspects of the cryptocurrency ecosystem: The Power of Long-Term Holding (HODLing): This event is a testament to the potential rewards of long-term investing in Bitcoin. Those who held onto their BTC through market cycles have seen exponential growth in value. The Maturation of the Crypto Market: Stories like this underscore how much the crypto market has matured in a decade. From a niche technology to a multi-trillion dollar asset class, the journey has been remarkable. Continued Interest in Bitcoin: Even after more than a decade, Bitcoin continues to capture attention and generate headlines. Its resilience and potential as a store of value remain strong. On-Chain Analytics and Transparency: The fact that Lookonchain was able to track and report this bitcoin transfer highlights the transparency of blockchain technology and the power of on-chain analytics in providing insights into market activity. Actionable Insights: Lessons from the Dormant Wallet What can we learn from this dormant bitcoin wallet story? Here are some actionable insights: Consider Long-Term Crypto Investments: While the crypto market is volatile, this story reinforces the potential of long-term investments in fundamentally sound cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Secure Your Private Keys: This event indirectly emphasizes the importance of securely storing your private keys. Had the owner lost their keys, this fortune would have remained inaccessible.

Ripple Just Released a Video, and it opens with the Cardano Logo",https://timestabloid.com/big-news-coming-for-xrp-ripple-just-released-a-video-and-it-opens-with-the-cardano-logo/,"In a striking move that has ignited speculation across the crypto community, Ripple has released a new promotional video that opens with a surprising visual cue: the Cardano (ADA) logo. Shared by prominent crypto enthusiast Julia on X, the video’s opening scene has triggered a wave of interpretations and theories, especially given the rapidly evolving conversation around blockchain interoperability and asset tokenization. Julia, who posted the clip with the caption, “Ripple $XRP just released a video and it opens with the Cardano $ADA logo. Something big is coming… Are you bullish enough for this?”, was quick to hint at the possibility of a significant cross-chain development—or the very least, a strong nod to broader collaboration in the digital asset space. BREAKING: Ripple $XRP just released a video and it opens with the Cardano $ADA logo. Something big is coming… Are you bullish enough for this? pic.twitter.com/bra2cEp6Pe — Julia (@CryptoJulzss) April 7, 2025 The Tokenization Message The video presents a compelling case: tokenization is poised to revolutionize global finance. Ripple emphasizes the transformative power of tokenization in reshaping financial markets by making assets more accessible, significantly reducing costs, and streamlining settlement times. According to the video, tokenization has the potential to cut costs by up to 60% and reduce settlement periods from days to mere seconds. This isn’t hyperbole; it’s grounded in actual, measurable advances within the blockchain sector. Formerly hesitant about digital assets, institutional investors are adopting tokenization for its efficiency and transparency. Ripple projects that by 2033, tokenized assets could surpass $18.9 trillion, firmly establishing themselves as the new backbone of the global financial ecosystem. Why the Cardano Logo Matters What truly captured attention, however, was not just Ripple’s strong reaffirmation of its mission to enable institutional tokenization through the XRP Ledger, but the placement of the Cardano logo as the very first visual. This has led many to wonder: is Ripple signaling a collaborative framework with Cardano? Could this be the prelude to interoperability between the XRP Ledger and the Cardano blockchain? While no official announcement has been made confirming a partnership, the deliberate inclusion of Cardano’s branding—especially in a Ripple production—cannot be overlooked as a coincidence. Both platforms have historically emphasized utility and compliance, positioning themselves as institutional-friendly chains. Their shared focus on enterprise-grade solutions, regulatory clarity, and real-world adoption adds more weight to potential synergy between the two ecosystems. Interoperability and the Future of Finance The broader message of the video hints at something profound: the increasing inevitability of interoperability in blockchain’s next chapter. For tokenization to succeed at scale, seamless communication across chains is essential. This enables seamless and secure transfer of tokenized assets across various protocols. Ripple’s acknowledgment of interoperability as one of the key drivers of tokenization’s mass adoption lends further credibility to the idea that bridges between major blockchains—such as XRP and Cardano—are more than theoretical. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Moreover, regulatory clarity, another theme emphasized in the video, is something Ripple and Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson , has actively championed. As global governments and financial watchdogs begin to understand and accommodate tokenized instruments, the foundations for cross-network collaboration are being quietly, but steadily laid. Community Reaction and Speculation The XRP and ADA communities have responded with cautious optimism. Speculation ranges from hopes of a shared liquidity protocol to more ambitious dreams of a jointly developed tokenization platform or digital identity system. While it’s important to distinguish between fan-driven speculation and formal development, it’s undeniable that Ripple’s visual cue has stirred attention precisely because of the strategic and calculated nature of its messaging. In a landscape often dominated by hype and quick reactions, Ripple’s track record suggests intentionality behind its communications. The mention of interoperability, real-world impact, and trillion-dollar projections suggests that Ripple sees itself—and perhaps, key allies like Cardano—as central players in this unfolding financial transformation. Ripple’s video serves as both a vision statement and a teaser, presenting tokenization not merely as innovation, but as inevitability. With $18.9 trillion on the horizon and financial institutions increasingly aligned with blockchain solutions, the opening frame featuring Cardano may be a subtle but powerful prelude to collaboration—or, at the very least, mutual recognition among blockchain leaders. Whether it foreshadows a deeper integration between XRP and Cardano remains to be seen. One thing is clear: tokenization is no longer a concept of the future. It’s a present reality that’s rapidly advancing. As Julia questioned, “Are you optimistic enough for what’s coming?” — the near future will likely show just how much growth to expect.

Murphy is suing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to force the agency to reveal what it knows about the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, following claims that DHS may have information on the pseudonymous figure. The U.S. DHS is being sued by crypto attorney James A. Murphy to uncover the real identity of Bitcoin ( BTC ) creator, who goes by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Murphy, who is licensed to practice law in New York and Virginia, regularly shares legal insights with his followers on X under the handle @MetaLawMan. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, follows Murphy’s attempts to obtain information through a Freedom of Information Act request submitted to the DHS on Feb. 12. Murphy claims that the agency has ignored his request, violating its statutory obligation to respond. A lawyer representing Murphy stated in the complaint, “Given the massive public and private investment in Bitcoin, it is important for Mr. Murphy and the public to understand better what the federal government knows about the identity of the actor(s) responsible for creating Bitcoin.” Murphy specifically wants access to documents related to an interview conducted by DHS Special Agent Rana Saoud in 2019, in which she allegedly claimed to know Nakamoto’s identity. According to Murphy, Saoud mentioned that four individuals were involved in creating Bitcoin, and that she had met with them to discuss its development. With billions of dollars recently invested in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and the U.S. government’s plans to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, Murphy believes this information is crucial. He has urged DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, appointed by Donald Trump, to disclose Nakamoto’s identity voluntarily. If the DHS does not cooperate, he said, he will continue to pursue legal action to uncover the truth.

Dozens of figures have been speculated to be Nakamoto, including Japanese-American engineer Dorian Nakamoto (due to name similarities and technical expertise), cryptographer Hal Finney (who was the first person to receive a recorded BTC transaction), Adam Back , CEO of Blockstream (for his early work on cryptographic protocols like Hashcash), Wei Dai (creator of b-money, a precursor to Bitcoin), and Paul Le Roux (due to his alleged connection to the first BTC transaction sent to Hal Finney). Most recently, Canadian software developer and cryptographer Peter Todd was spotlighted in the HBO documentary “Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery”, which speculated that he was Satoshi Nakamoto, based on his early activity in Bitcoin forums and similarity to Satoshi’s writing style. Todd has vehemently denied these claims, calling them as “ludicrous” and criticizing the documentary’s speculative approach.

BTC price witnessed a 6% uptick in the past 24 hours, closing in at the $79K level. Whereas ETH price surged nearly 10% to top $1,500. FARTCOIN price skyrocketed roughly 38% to cross the $0.5 mark. Now, cryptocurrency watchers are left wondering whether the current upswing is signaling an imminent recovery or is it just a short-lived bubble amid the ongoing market uncertainty fueled by Trump’s tariffs . Crypto Market Upswing Ignites Recovery Sentiments Among Investors A couple of market analysts have recently posted on X, asserting that the current upswing suggests that a recovery trend is cooking. Besides, some even believe that the massive correction witnessed recently is just a normal part of bull cycles. Renowned market trader Conor Kenny has said that the broader “market is recovering pretty nicely,” pointing towards today’s upswing. Source: Conor Kenny, X Simultaneously, renowned analyst Crypto Rover stated in another X post, “Big corrections are normal during a bull market.” Altogether, with renowned experts showing a strong sense of confidence in the crypto market’s long-term prospects despite the recent volatility, traders and investors sighed in relief amid today’s price pump. Source: Crypto Rover, X Bitcoin Price: Here’s What Analysts Predict For The Future Notably, analyst ‘Crypto Rover’ highlighted in another X post that the Bitcoin CME gap came in at $83,887. This statistic basically suggested that while the Bitcoin futures market was closed on weekends, BTC hit $83K, creating a gap on the futures chart. Source: Crypto Rover, X Historically, traders and investors have seen this gap refilled, indicating price trends eventually return to these levels. Asserting on this factor, the analyst says, “SEND IT BACK HIGHER.” Intriguingly, BTC price has erased nearly 5% weekly amid crypto market uncertainty brewed due to Trump’s tariffs. However, another renowned market analyst took to X, projecting a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. Market expert Javon Marks said, “BTC’s MACD confirms and is coming off of another hidden bullish divergence.” This statement revealed that the Moving Average Convergence Divergence, a momentum indicator, is signaling a trend shift to bullish. Source: Javon Marks, X In addition, renowned expert ‘Titan of Crypto’ revealed in his X post that “BTC bounced perfectly off the bottom line of the Supertrend indicator on the weekly chart.” This analysis hinted that bulls are again in control as the flagship crypto tested major support on the weekly Supertrend chart and bounced back up. Source: Titan of Crypto, X The abovementioned analysis of Bitcoin’s price chart indicates that a recovery is brewing, although short-term volatility remains the essence of the crypto market. Ethereum Price Forecast: Here’s What The Latest Metrics Signal An Ethereum OG rattled traders and investors by dumping 2,000 coins to Kraken despite ETH’s price showing signs of a recovery today. Data from Lookonchain revealed that an OG wallet revived after nearly 7 years of inactivity to dump $3 million worth of coins into Kraken. The massive selloff conversely set off bearish sentiments, underscoring the loss of market interest and rising selling for Ethereum. Despite major bear markets in the past 7 years, the OG decided not to sell his holdings. However, uncertainty amid Trump’s tariffs saga has left crypto whales and sharks apprehensive. The current market sentiment for Ethereum in the wake of this aspect is primarily uncertain. Traders and investors are awaiting a clear reversal signal before re-entering into the crypto market. However, some also believe the recent market dip to be a perfect time to open new positions and capitalize via a buy-the-dip strategy. Fartcoin Price Overview: Crypto Market Analyst Says Bulls In Control Data from Nansen suggested that FARTCOIN has secured a prominent spot on investors’ radars in the interim. Some traders are even cashing out big amid roughly 40% gains taken by the meme token intraday. Simultaneously, renowned market trader RookieXBT took to X, highlighting that the coin’s volume surged whereas the rest of the market fell apart. The latest metrics for the coin signal that a strong recovery sentiment is brewing, although short-term volatility may be witnessed due to broader trends. Source: RookieXBT, X Altogether, the current dynamics suggest that the crypto market’s long-term prospects glimmer with optimism and recovery to previous highs is highly possible despite short-term volatility.

According to the proposal, the initiative is intended to enhance visibility for USD1 ahead of its broader launch. The stablecoin, backed by U.S. Treasuries and managed by custodian BitGo, is part of WLFI’s effort to establish a regulated dollar-pegged digital asset. WLFI Plans Ethereum-Based USD1 Airdrop The airdrop, which will occur on Ethereum Mainnet and be funded by WLFI, is still being finalized in terms of distribution amount and timeline. “Testing the airdrop mechanism in a live setting is a necessary step to ensure smart contract functionality and readiness,” the proposal stated. However, the company reserves the right to alter or cancel the test at any time and may impose additional eligibility requirements. The proposal outlines a multi-phase process: community feedback, finalization of the distribution plan, a governance vote, and an official announcement. Voters can select from “Yes,” “No,” or “Abstain,” and early voting trends show a majority in favor of the test. We just posted a new governance proposal: To test our airdrop functionality by distributing USD1 to all $WLFI holders — rewarding our earliest supporters and preparing for future growth. Join the discussion https://t.co/NDg5yMYUrM — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) April 7, 2025 WLFI launched USD1 in March , coinciding with congressional discussions over the bipartisan STABLE Act. Critics have raised concerns over Trump’s financial ties to the project, including $390 million reportedly allocated to DT Marks DEFI LLC, a Trump-affiliated entity, from the $550 million raised during token sales. The platform’s governance token remains non-transferable, raising additional questions about transparency and decentralization. Tensions have escalated in Washington, with Democratic lawmakers pushing amendments to the STABLE Act that would prohibit sitting presidents and their families from launching stablecoins. Meanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Maxine Waters have called on the SEC to release internal documents related to WLFI, citing concerns over “regulatory favoritism.” The scrutiny follows the SEC’s recent decision to pause enforcement actions, including one involving Justin Sun, a WLFI investor and founder of the Tron blockchain . Trump Family’s World Liberty Financial Concludes Token Sale Last month, WLFI completed its token sale, raising an impressive $550 million and ranking among the most successful in crypto history. The public sale of WLFI’s governance token began on October 15, initially targeting a $300 million raise. The project offered 20 billion tokens at $0.015 each, restricted to whitelisted investors. However, early demand fell short, generating only $11 million from the sale of 766 million tokens, prompting the team to revise its target down to $30 million. Momentum shifted after the launch of Official Trump (TRUMP) and Melania Meme (MELANIA), two Trump-themed tokens that surged in popularity. Their success fueled renewed interest in WLFI, leading to stronger participation in its token sale. By January 20, the initial sale had closed with 20% of the token supply sold. Seizing the opportunity, the project issued an additional 5 billion WLFI tokens at $0.05 each. Demand remained high, and by March 13, 99% of the newly released tokens had been sold.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) was granted the green light by the Federal Court of Australia to dissolve the firms on just and equitable grounds, marking one of the most significant crackdowns on scam networks operating under the guise of legitimate businesses. The majority of these now-defunct entities were believed to be fronts for “pig butchering” schemes — a manipulative scam technique where perpetrators build emotional relationships with victims before coercing them into fake crypto investment platforms. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court stated that most of these companies had been established using fraudulent credentials and were never intended to offer real services. Justice Angus Stewart, in reviewing misconduct reports from 17 of the implicated firms, noted a recurring pattern of deception that matched the structure of pig butchering scams. “There appears to be a common pattern of scam activity,” he affirmed in a ruling dated March 21, citing the manipulation of trust for financial exploitation. International Victims, Phantom Companies The scope of the fraud is global. According to court documents, nearly 1,500 investors across 14 countries — including the U.S., Australia, India, Ghana, and France — had lodged claims totaling over $35.8 million. Yet shockingly, only three of the 95 companies were found to possess any actual assets. The rest existed in name only, lacking the infrastructure or capital expected of genuine enterprises. To facilitate the dismantling of the network, Catherine Conneely and Thomas Birch of Cor Cordis have been appointed as joint liquidators. Their investigations led to the recommendation that 92 of the companies be immediately shut down and deregistered. Australia Fights Against a Digital Hydra But ASIC’s efforts extend beyond corporate takedowns. The regulator has also been targeting the digital footprints of these scams. It is currently removing around 130 fraudulent websites weekly, having already taken down more than 10,000 — including over 7,200 fake investment platforms and 1,500 phishing sites. Still, Court likened the effort to battling a hydra: “You shut down one and two more take its place.” Despite these odds, Australia’s National Anti-Scam Centre recently reported a 26% drop in scam losses this year , suggesting that regulators may finally be gaining ground in an escalating cyber war.

The latest trigger came when President Donald Trump threatened additional tariffs on China and announced a blanket 10% tariff on all goods entering the U.S., set to take effect on April 9. The announcement triggered a broad market sell-off , though major crypto assets staged a modest recovery in the aftermath. Bitcoin ( BTC ) bounced back slightly, and XRP climbed to $1.88 at press time. XRP one-day price chart. Source: Finbold However, with President Trump doubling down on tariffs and threatening an additional 50% levy on Chinese goods, uncertainty remains over whether this rebound can be sustained. As macroeconomic volatility intensifies and regulatory uncertainty lingers, investors are closely watching whether XRP will continue its slide toward the $1 mark or begin to reverse course. XRP ETF debut signals rising interest A key development is the XRP news today as on April 8 the launch of the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF (XXRP), the first XRP-linked ETF in the U.S., albeit a leveraged one goes live. The fund aims to deliver twice the daily return of XRP, tapping into growing investor interest in leveraged crypto products. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas called it ‘odd’ that XRP’s ETF debut came in leveraged form before the approval of a traditional spot fund. A 2x XRP ETF is launching tmrw in US, the first-ever XRP ETF on the market. Very odd (maybe a first) that a new asset’s first ETF is leveraged. Spot XRP still not approved, altho our odds are pretty high. Story via ⁦⁦ @isabelletanlee ⁩ pic.twitter.com/Eg4Wq5Y1Qi — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 7, 2025 Ripple XRP news Meanwhile, legal uncertainty remains a significant overhang for XRP, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has gone silent on the status of its long-running case against Ripple. Notably, in previous instances, the commission has officially dropped cases shortly after similar periods of silence—something that has yet to materialize in XRP’s situation. A formal resolution could mark a turning point for the token, potentially paving the way for a U.S. spot XRP ETF, with applications currently under review from firms such as Grayscale, Bitwise, 21 Shares, and WisdomTree. Can XRP fall to $1? From a technical standpoint , XRP’s break below the $2 level has confirmed a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern, often viewed as a precursor to deeper losses. This setup could send XRP to $1.30, as noted by crypto analyst Ali Martinez , or potentially lower, especially if bearish sentiment intensifies. With network activity plunging 65% , macroeconomic uncertainty rising, and a hawkish Federal Reserve maintaining pressure on risk assets, XRP’s path forward may ultimately hinge on how quickly regulatory clarity arrives and whether ETF-driven demand is strong enough to reverse the downtrend.

This is due to architectural differences in platform infrastructures, user interfaces, and the inherent complexities of decentralized platforms. In a step to address this, the Seychelles-based leading crypto exchange, Bitget, has announced the launch of Bitget Onchain to bridge the gap between DEX and CEX users. Unveiled on Monday, its new feature, Bitget Chain, will allow its users to trade Onchain tokens with a spot account directly via its exchange application. How will Bitget Onchain Help Users Bitget Onchain will offer users of the its centralized exchange a direct and seamless way to explore and invest in decentralized assets. By leveraging this platform, users can gain early exposure to emerging on-chain projects and tokens, which are often first introduced in decentralized markets before making their way to centralized exchanges. ​ As per the Press Release shared with CoinGape , the primary objective of Bitget Onchain is to democratize access to these assets. This will certainly help in ensuring that CEX users are not at a disadvantage compared to their counterparts in the DeFi space. How can Users Purchase DEX-only tokens via Bitget Users can trade on-chain assets directly using USDT or USDC from their spot accounts on Bitget. This will eliminate the prior need for external Web3 wallets or complex setups. ​ Bitget Onchain assets will include those new and emerging tokens that traditionally live on decentralized blockchains (like Solana, BNB Chain, Base), But with its new feature, they can be bought/traded directly on its CEX platform — without needing a Web3 wallet like MetaMask. Initially, Bitget Onchain is supporting trading on the Solana, BNB Smart Chain (BSC), and Base networks, offering a selection of tokens including RFC, KTA. This also includes 30 other small-cap or emerging tokens that normally would only be found on DEXs like Raydium (Solana), PancakeSwap (BNB Chain), or BaseSwap (Base). These tokens are usually not yet listed on major centralized exchanges and are only accessible via DEXs (until now). But despite in early-stage, they tend to be have combination of highly risky yet highly rewarding. According to Tokeninsights, in Q4 2024, newer DEX tokens outperformed established ones. Tokens like AERO and THE saw exceptional returns, with AERO increasing over 2000% and THE gaining 500%. In another instance, recently, Solana DEX Orca’s ORCA token surged by 170% as Upbit exchange recently announced its listing. Thus, as Bitget aims to onboard more on-chain assets, this integration will simplify the process of accessing and trading emerging on-chain assets, providing users with a seamless and secure experience. Notably, Bitget Onchain is also incorporating AI-driven smart screening for enhanced investment precision by conducting real-time filtering of on-chain assets. This feature minimizes exposure to uninformed investments, enabling users to make strategic and data-driven decisions Implications for the Broader Crypto Ecosystem By providing CEX users with early access to on-chain assets, Bitget is lowering the barriers to entry for DeFi investments. This will enable a more diverse group of investors to participate in the decentralized market. Further, it can also contribute to increased liquidity across both markets, by f acilitating the movement of assets between centralized and decentralized platforms – benefiting traders and projects alike. ​ The post Bitget Onchain Product Goes Live – Allows Users to Purchase DEX-only tokens on CEX appeared first on CoinGape .",Pulse,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|SPONSORED|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-04-08 09:54:02

As of April 8th, the index, a product of Alternative.me, registered a score of 24. While this is a marginal increase of one point from the previous day, it’s crucial to note that it firmly remains within the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone. What does this mean for you, the crypto enthusiast, investor, or curious observer? Let’s dive deep into understanding this vital market gauge and decipher the current sentiment gripping the crypto sphere. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Your Sentiment Compass Think of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index as a compass for market sentiment. It’s designed to distill the complex emotions driving the cryptocurrency market into a single, easily understandable number. Ranging from 0 to 100, this index offers a snapshot of whether the market is dominated by fear or greed: 0-25: Extreme Fear – This zone suggests investors are excessively worried. It often signals a potential buying opportunity as assets might be undervalued. 26-49: Fear – Indicates a cautious market mood, where investors are apprehensive. 50-75: Greed – Points towards increasing optimism and a willingness to invest, potentially signaling market growth. 76-100: Extreme Greed – Suggests excessive market euphoria, which can be a warning sign of a potential bubble or market correction. Currently, with the index at 24, we are squarely in ‘Extreme Fear’. But what factors contribute to this reading? Unpacking the Metrics: What Fuels the Fear? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t based on gut feelings; it’s a data-driven analysis incorporating six key market indicators. Let’s break down each component: Volatility (25%) : Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often breeds fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) : Analyzes Bitcoin’s market momentum and trading volume relative to recent averages. Weak momentum can contribute to fear. Social Media (15%) : Tracks sentiment trends on social media platforms, primarily Twitter and Reddit, focusing on crypto-related hashtags and engagement to gauge public opinion. Negative social sentiment amplifies fear. Surveys (15%) : Conducts periodic crypto surveys to directly assess investor sentiment and expectations. (Note: This factor is sometimes less consistently updated than others). Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Monitors Bitcoin’s dominance in the overall crypto market. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a ‘flight to safety’ from altcoins during fearful times. Google Trends (10%) : Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries. A surge in searches like “Bitcoin crash” can signal increased fear. Crypto Fear & Greed Index Factors Factor Weight Description Impact on Fear/Greed Volatility 25% Bitcoin’s price fluctuations High volatility increases fear Market Momentum/Volume 25% Bitcoin’s trading strength Weak momentum increases fear Social Media Sentiment 15% Public opinion on crypto social platforms Negative sentiment increases fear Surveys 15% Investor sentiment from polls Negative survey results increase fear Bitcoin Dominance 10% Bitcoin’s share of the crypto market Increased dominance can indicate fear Google Trends 10% Bitcoin search query popularity Surge in negative searches increases fear Extreme Fear in Crypto: What Does It Really Mean? The persistent ‘Extreme Fear’ reading in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index suggests a prevailing sense of anxiety and uncertainty within the cryptocurrency market. This could stem from a variety of factors currently influencing the crypto landscape, such as: Macroeconomic Uncertainty : Global economic headwinds, including inflation concerns, rising interest rates, and geopolitical tensions, often spill over into the crypto market, inducing risk aversion. Regulatory Scrutiny : Ongoing regulatory debates and potential crackdowns in various jurisdictions can create nervousness among investors. Market Corrections : Recent price corrections and volatility in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum can contribute to a fearful outlook, especially for newer investors. Negative News Cycles : Bearish news headlines, exchange hacks, or project failures can amplify fear and dampen market sentiment. However, it’s crucial to remember that ‘Extreme Fear’ is not necessarily a purely negative signal. In fact, historically, periods of extreme fear have often presented compelling buying opportunities. Why? Is Extreme Fear a Buying Opportunity in Crypto? The contrarian investment strategy often thrives when fear is rampant. When the Crypto Market Sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, assets can become undervalued due to panic selling. This ‘blood in the streets’ scenario can be the ideal time for savvy investors to accumulate quality crypto assets at discounted prices. Consider these points: Undervalued Assets : Fear-driven sell-offs can push prices below their intrinsic value, creating potential for significant future gains when sentiment recovers. Reduced Competition : During fearful times, many retail investors may exit the market, reducing competition and allowing long-term investors to accumulate positions more easily. Historical Precedent : Looking back at crypto market history, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ have often been followed by significant bull runs. The adage “buy when there’s blood in the streets” rings true for some crypto cycles. However, proceed with caution! ‘Extreme Fear’ can also be a signal of further market downturns. It’s essential to conduct thorough research, understand your risk tolerance, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Don’t blindly follow the index; use it as one tool among many in your crypto analysis toolkit. Actionable Insights: Navigating the ‘Extreme Fear’ Zone So, how should you interpret the current ‘Extreme Fear’ reading of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index ? Here are some actionable insights: Review Your Portfolio : Assess your current crypto holdings. Are you comfortable with your risk exposure in the face of potential continued volatility? Due Diligence is Key : If considering buying, focus on fundamentally strong projects with solid technology, use cases, and teams. ‘Extreme Fear’ periods can weed out weaker projects, but strong ones can rebound powerfully. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) : Instead of trying to time the market bottom, consider DCA – investing a fixed amount at regular intervals. This strategy can mitigate risk during volatile periods. Stay Informed : Keep abreast of market news, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic trends that could be influencing sentiment. Manage Emotions : Fear and greed are powerful emotions that can cloud judgment. Rely on your research and long-term investment strategy, rather than succumbing to panic or FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Conclusion: Fear as a Barometer, Not a Stop Sign The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 24, lingering in ‘Extreme Fear’, paints a picture of a market gripped by uncertainty. While this might seem daunting, it’s crucial to understand that fear is a natural part of market cycles. This index serves as a valuable barometer of Crypto Market Sentiment , helping us gauge the prevailing emotions driving price action. Whether this ‘Extreme Fear’ zone represents a prime buying opportunity or a precursor to further declines remains to be seen. However, by understanding the index, considering its underlying factors, and acting with prudence and informed strategy, you can navigate these turbulent times and potentially position yourself for future opportunities in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. Remember, informed decisions, not emotional reactions, are the cornerstone of successful crypto investing.

The tokens being delisted include BADGER, BAL, BETA, CREAM, CTXC, ELF, FIRO, HARD, NULS, PROS, SNT, TROY, UFT, and VIDT. In an announcement made on Apr. 8, Binance explained that the delisting follows both internal reviews and the results of a community vote. Over 103,000 votes were cast by more than 24,000 participants, and after filtering out ineligible votes, around 93,000 votes were validated. To be eligible to vote, users had to hold at least 0.01 Binance Coin ( BNB ). Low trading volumes, a lack of project development, a lack of community involvement, and non-compliance with the platform’s internal or regulatory standards are some of the reasons provided by Binance for the delistings . The exchange pointed out that tokens that were not delisted in this round might still be removed later on if they don’t satisfy the requirements. You might also like: Binance integrates Apple Pay, Google Pay via deal with Worldpay All trading pairs for the 14 impacted tokens will be removed at 03:00 UTC on Apr. 16, and deposits for the tokens will be suspended. However, users will still be able to withdraw these tokens until June 9, after which any remaining balances may be converted into stablecoins. This action follows Binance’s Mar. 31 delisting of Tether ( USDT ) spot trading pairs in the European Economic Area to comply with the newly enacted Markets in Crypto-Assets regulations. MiCA aims to improve oversight and accountability over digital assets within the EU by requiring exchanges to delist tokens that don’t meet specific compliance standards. Exchanges need to demonstrate that they meet guidelines for enhanced security, transparency, and compliance with anti-money laundering regulations . The increased regulatory pressure has forced exchanges to be more selective about which tokens they support in the region.

This follows court approval, which allows the regulation to wind down the corporate entities. According to a statement from the regulator, the Federal Court of Australia agreed with its application to shut down these companies operating under false pretenses. Most of these companies reportedly registered using false details and did not offer any service; they only served as fronts for scammers. The report said: “The Court agreed with ASIC in finding that there was a justifiable lack of confidence in the conduct and management of each of the 95 companies, with Justice Stewart calling the case for winding up each company “overwhelming”.” Upon granting the application, the court also appointed liquidators to manage the winding up, and victims are already sending their claims to them. Court filings show that the liquidators have received over 1,500 claims worth over $35 million from victims in 14 countries, including the US, India, Cameroon, Nepal, Ghana, France, and Australia. Speaking on the matter, ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said that ASIC had taken steps to protect investors. By removing the companies from its registry, they no longer have any credibility, which should help potential investors from falling victim. She added that scammers use complex techniques, including registering companies with stolen identities to fleece victims. Pig butchering has become quite popular for scammers, with fake crypto investment schemes being a popular option. Pig butchering scam is growing and now accounts for 33% of all crypto scams (Source: Chainalysis) According to a report by Chainalysis , pig butchering is one of the major factors driving crypto scams. The blockchain analytics firm said revenue from this scam increased by 40% between 2023 and 2024. It tied the origin of the scams to Southeast Asia but noted that they are expanding globally, with criminal syndicates using human trafficking victims to carry out the scams. Interestingly, it was noted that scammers also use artificial intelligence, as AI tools now allow scammers to impersonate others and create fake content that looks genuine. Australia’s ASIC has shut down over 10,000 scam websites Meanwhile, the commission also noted that it has shut down websites and digital platforms associated with these companies. According to the Court, ASIC shuts down an average of more than 130 websites every week to stamp out the scams. The ASIC report also shows that the regulator has taken down over 10,000 websites, including fake investment platforms, phishing hyperlinks, and crypto investment scams. 2,460 of these websites were taken down in the second half of 2024. Still, these scams remain a major problem, and the regulators want consumers to be extra vigilant. Court said: “These scams are like hydras: you shut down one and two more take its place. That’s why we’re warning consumers that the threat of scams and identity fraud remains high. We remind consumers to be vigilant.” So far, the efforts have helped to reduce crypto scams in Australia. The amount lost to scams in 2024 was $2 billion, a 26% decline compared to 2023. Scam reports also declined by 17.87%. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

While China threatened to hit back hard against Donald Trump’s proposed 50% tariff on Chinese imports, crypto analysts believe Bitcoin is on the verge of a huge breakout. Matrixport, a Singapore blockchain company, cited similarities with 2015, when the devaluation of the yuan first caused a sell-off before Bitcoin recovered strongly by the end of the year. Matrixport Forecasts Bitcoin Bounce Back In a note published on X , Matrixport noted the USD/CNY exchange rate is approaching a resistance level. This, according to them, would be similar to the 2015 configuration, where Bitcoin dropped first before it surged as China devalued its currency. We can expect to see the same scenario play out now,” the report said, highlighting long-term bullishness despite near-term turbulence from U.S. Treasury yield fears. China Committed to “Fight to the End” on Tariffs Beijing has condemned Trump’s tariff policy as economic blackmail. With Trump urging new duties unless China relents, the trade war has grown sharply. China has already applied 34% tariffs on American imports. “The U.S. side’s threat… once again exposes the American side’s blackmailing nature,” a Chinese ministry of commerce spokesperson explained. Crypto as Hedge In Uncertainty Times Bitcoin could benefit from a weakening yuan and rising geopolitical uncertainty, says Matrixport. With traditional markets in fear, investors could turn to crypto.

The downfall of Mt Gox,https://crypto.news/what-is-mt-gox/,"The downfall of Mount Gox, once the biggest cryptocurrency exchange, is a lesson in what can go wrong. It took 10 years after the platform’s collapse for creditors to start getting their compensation. But this disaster pushed the entire crypto industry to rethink its approach to security. Table of Contents What is Mt Gox? Mount Gox bankruptcy in detail Mt Gox payments to creditors Mt Gox news in 2025 Who was the Mt Gox hacker? Looking back at Mt. Gox What is Mt Gox? The story of Mt Gox began in 2007, long before Bitcoin and cryptocurrency were even on the radar. That year, developer Jed McCaleb created a platform called Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange (MTGOX) on the website mtgox.com, designed for trading cards from the popular fantasy game, Magic: The Gathering. You might also like: Mt. Gox wallet moves $1B in Bitcoin raising market concerns Three years later, after learning about Bitcoin ( BTC ), McCaleb decided to pivot the platform into a cryptocurrency exchange. However, about a year after this transformation, he chose to sell the platform to Mark Karpeles, a French developer living in Japan, citing a lack of time to focus on the project. In the meantime, Mt Gox rapidly gained popularity. By 2011, the platform had tens of thousands of users, and by 2013 it was handling over 70% of all BTC transactions worldwide. In February 2014, Mt Gox suspended trading, and in April 2014 it filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. This was due to the loss of 850k BTCs, valued at $450 million at the time, which were stolen from Mt Gox’s wallets. The theft was the largest of its kind at the time, and it shook the confidence of many in the Bitcoin community. Mount Gox bankruptcy in detail On February 24, 2014, Mt. Gox suddenly stopped all Bitcoin transactions, and within hours, its website went offline. It soon became clear that around 750k BTC, belonging to users, had been stolen over a span of several years, and the platform was unable to recover from the loss. Four days later, on February 28, Mt Gox filed for bankruptcy and announced its shutdown. In its bankruptcy filing, the exchange revealed that, in addition to the stolen user funds, hackers had also made off with 100k BTC from the exchange’s own reserves. In total, this brought the theft to a staggering 850k BTC, roughly 7% of the entire Bitcoin supply at the time. Investigations revealed that hackers had stolen the private key to an Mt Gox wallet in September 2011. This key allowed them to gain control of the flow of cryptocurrency in and out of the exchange. Using this key, the attackers gradually drained the exchange’s funds over a span of several years. In May 2016, the Kraken exchange, which had assisted in the investigation, completed the process of collecting and analyzing creditors’ claims. According to analysts, 24,750 users had filed for compensation. Analysts, including Tokyo security company WizSec, have claimed that theft goes back to 2011. At the time, the exchange lost about $400k worth of Bitcoin. Its rise continued, and it reached its peak market share in 2013. In 2014, things took a turn for the worse when users complained of slow withdrawals. The exchange then suspended all withdrawals and made the public aware of the full extent of its losses. Mt Gox payments to creditors In September 2018, a Japanese court approved a rehabilitation plan that will see Mt Gox creditors receive roughly $1 billion in compensation. Investors received their first payments in December 2023 – nearly ten years after their funds were frozen in February 2014.As of March 2025, Mt Gox still held around 35k bitcoins, worth about $3.08 billion. Last year, the exchange pushed back its repayment deadline for creditors, extending it from October 31, 2024, to October 31, 2025, due to delays in verification and processing. Mt Gox news in 2025 On March 25, 2025, Arkham Intelligence noticed some major movements from the Mt Gox wallet. A total of 893 bitcoins were sent to a new address, while another 10,608 BTCs were transferred to a different wallet under Mt Gox’s control. A tiny amount of 0.000017 BTC was also sent to Kraken, likely for testing purposes. [ATTENTION] Mt. Gox just moved 11,501.4 $BTC ($1B) again! This includes 10,608 $BTC ($929.7M) sent to a new wallet and 893.4 $BTC ($78.3M) to a warm wallet. Notably, after Mt. Gox’s previous transfer, 332 $BTC ($25.5M) was deposited into #Bitstamp . It is likely the 893.4 $BTC … https://t.co/8HryhiHSoT pic.twitter.com/NBQtcWSREJ — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) March 25, 2025 This has led to speculation that the transfers could be linked to upcoming repayments for creditors. These movements follow earlier substantial transfers this month, including 12,000 BTCs on March 6 and 11,833 BTCs on March 11. Spot On Chain noted that some of these earlier transfers ended up on the Bitstamp exchange. Who was the Mt Gox hacker? Who exactly was behind the Mt Gox hack? That’s a question that continues to linger in the crypto world. While we don’t have a clear answer, there are a few theories that people keep going back to. You might also like: Total Recall: Why the crypto community still worries about the Mt. Gox collapse Some believe it was an inside job — someone with access to the platform’s systems might have exploited it. Others speculate that North Korean hackers could have been behind it, possibly to create chaos in the world’s financial markets. But with no definitive proof to support any of these ideas, the true identity of the hackers remains elusive. Looking back at Mt. Gox Mt Gox was a very powerful entity in the early years of Bitcoin. Bitcoin went from less than $1 to over $1k in those years. Had Mt Gox maintained its stature, it would easily be the largest cryptocurrency exchange today, moving billions in trading volumes. However, its collapse shaped crypto security, allowing regulators to participate through client protecting policies. Mt Gox lost 850k BTCs in the hack. These losses, some stemming from alleged management negligence,were the subject of lawsuits in subsequent years. After years of lawsuits, the Mt Gox exchange estate is still subject to claims.",Learn|Сrypto hack,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|ARKM,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-08 10:06:39

Since the start of April, 2025, the S&P 500 index has declined by 10.11%. Currently, it sits at $5,062.24. Fink predicts that the stock market could fall another 20%. His comments come as Bitcoin signals bearish momentum with a death cross pattern. Here is what you need to know. Bitcoin Triggers Death Cross: A Bearish Signal Emerges Yesterday, the 50-day Simple Moving Average of Bitcoin dropped below its 200-day SMA. The pattern, which forms when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average, is known as a ‘ Death Cross ’. This is a bearish signal. Since the start of April, the BTC market has declined by over 4.13%. On April 6 (just before the formation of the Death Cross pattern), the market dropped sharply by nearly 6.10%. Yesterday’s bullish momentum, which was triggered by a fake news report about the possible pause of Trump’s tariff action against China for around 90 days, failed to help the market recover from the sharp correction. As of now, the BTC price sits at $79,060. Experts believe that the crypto market is currently following the trend in the US economy, especially the US tech market. The US stock market is currently in a highly turbulent state. The aggressive tariff policy of US President Donald Trump has created havoc across the globe, including in the US market. Since the beginning of this month alone, the S&P 500 index has declined by approximately 9.56%. Larry Fink: “We’re Probably in a Recession Already” Interestingly, while speaking at an interview, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink stated that the US is probably already in a recession. He even warned that stock markets might fall another 20% due to fear triggered by steep US tariffs. He pointed out that tariffs might lead to higher prices and inflation. No Major Rate Cuts Expected, Says Fink During the March 2025 meeting, the US Federal Reserve kept the funds rate unchanged at 4.25% to 4.5%. There were rumours that the US Fed would resume its rate cut policy soon. In the previous year, the Fed implemented rate cuts at least 3 times. While discussing the probability of Fed rate cuts, he denounced rumours that the Federal Reserve will consider 4 to 5 interest rate cuts this year. Fink advised that the US government should implement pro-growth policies and focus more on deregulation. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Will Bitcoin Price Rise as China’s Yuan Hits 2023 Lows?

It’s the MOVE Index. That’s the bond market’s measure of volatility, and right now it’s on fire. On Monday, the index hit 137.2996, after jumping +11.5930 points in one day—a 9.22% surge. If it crosses 140, it hits the same emergency zone that has previously triggered Fed intervention. That’s when they stop talking tough and start printing money. The MOVE Index works like the VIX, but instead of stocks, it tracks how unstable the U.S. Treasury bond market is. Right now, it’s sitting near the cliff. If the index crosses 140, there could be a rush to dump Treasuries, and the financial system could face pressure that forces the Fed to act fast to avoid a deeper meltdown. MOVE index. Source: TradingView MOVE Index crosses key levels and builds panic The current jump is coming off a four-month stretch where the MOVE Index stayed trapped between 85 and 115. That sideways range had fake breakouts and constant rejections. But in late March, things changed. The index jumped from ~91 and printed 13 green candles in 14 sessions, which shows an aggressive upward surge. That kind of run doesn’t happen without real fear. From a chart analysis point of view, this isn’t a slow buildup. It’s panic. There’s been no pullback. No breaks. Just a nonstop upward move. That’s usually driven by stress, not just changing expectations. The rally broke above previous highs from January (~108) and March (~115). That breakout signals that bond traders are responding to pressure—not positioning. The rally structure is also aggressive. The candles are rising with almost no upper wicks, which tells traders aren’t selling into strength. There’s no resistance in the chart until 140–145, a zone that acted as a ceiling during the October 2023 spike. That zone isn’t visible now, but it’s important because it’s tied to past Fed responses. Even momentum indicators like RSI show extension, not exhaustion. The vertical move and clean structure show that buyers are controlling the action, and there’s no technical sign of reversal yet. That means the MOVE Index has room to keep going higher. Once it crosses 140, it hits a level that has triggered Federal Reserve action in past cycles. That level means liquidity is drying up, spreads are blowing out, and markets aren’t functioning. That’s when the Fed stops worrying about inflation and starts throwing liquidity at the system. Powell faces pressure as Trump triggers new volatility If the MOVE Index stays above 140 for even just two sessions, we expect many things to happen fast. That includes SOFR and repo market spreads widening, credit default swaps surging, and bond ETFs breaking away from their actual values. In that kind of situation, the Fed would have to react, even if inflation is still high. The usual playbook includes liquidity injections, repo operations, or even QE-lite tactics under the excuse of “market functioning.” The current stock market crash has fed into fears of stagflation—the mix of slow growth and rising prices. That’s a nightmare for any central bank. Lowering interest rates could help growth but would make inflation worse. Raising rates could slow inflation but choke the economy. So the Federal Reserve is stuck. Jerome Powell, the Fed Chair, said Friday that they aren’t rushing into a rate decision yet. “The appropriate path for Fed policy is not clear at this time,” Powell said. “It feels like we don’t need to be in a hurry.” He also said that while the new tariffs will probably cause a short-term jump in inflation, “it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent.”",OP-ED|Federal Reserve|Treasury Department|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-08 11:45:27

The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs market experienced a notable shift on April 7th, with a combined net outflow of $103.9 million. This marks the third consecutive day of withdrawals, raising eyebrows and prompting discussions about the current sentiment in the crypto market. Let’s dive into the details and understand what’s behind these Bitcoin ETF outflows and what it could mean for the future of crypto investments. Decoding the Latest Bitcoin ETF Outflows: What Happened on April 7th? According to data from Farside Investors, a financial information platform, April 7th saw a significant movement away from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs . Here’s a breakdown of where the outflows were most prominent: Grayscale’s GBTC: Leading the pack with a substantial outflow of $74 million. Invesco’s BTCO: Recorded outflows of $12.9 million. WisdomTree’s BTCW: Experienced outflows of $6.2 million. VanEck’s HODL: Saw outflows of $6.1 million. ARK Invest’s ARKB: Not far behind with $4.7 million in outflows. While these five ETFs experienced withdrawals, it’s worth noting that other crypto ETF market players reported minimal or no changes in their holdings. This suggests that the outflows might be concentrated in specific funds rather than a widespread exodus from all Bitcoin ETFs. But the question remains: why are we seeing these outflows, particularly from established funds like GBTC? Why are Investors Pulling Back from Spot Bitcoin ETFs? Several factors could be contributing to the recent investment outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs. Let’s explore some potential reasons: Profit Taking: After a significant rally in Bitcoin prices earlier in the year, some investors might be taking profits off the table. Selling ETF shares is a straightforward way to realize gains from Bitcoin’s price appreciation without directly managing Bitcoin wallets. Market Correction Concerns: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Concerns about a potential market correction could be prompting investors to reduce their exposure to Bitcoin, leading to ETF outflows. Alternative Investment Opportunities: With traditional markets also showing movement and other crypto assets gaining traction, investors might be reallocating their capital to explore different investment opportunities perceived as more attractive at this moment. GBTC Fee Structure: Grayscale’s GBTC has a higher fee structure compared to some of the newer spot Bitcoin ETFs. Investors who were previously locked into GBTC (before its conversion to an ETF) might now be opting to move their investments to lower-fee alternatives, contributing to GBTC outflows. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic uncertainties, inflation concerns, and changes in interest rate expectations can influence investor sentiment and risk appetite, potentially leading to shifts in investment strategies across all asset classes, including crypto. Analyzing GBTC Outflows: A Deeper Dive The significant GBTC outflows are particularly noteworthy. GBTC was the first and, for a long time, the only publicly traded Bitcoin investment vehicle available in the U.S. Its conversion to a spot ETF was a landmark event. However, its higher management fee compared to newer competitors like BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC might be a major driver behind the consistent outflows. Consider this comparison: ETF Expense Ratio Grayscale GBTC 1.5% BlackRock IBIT 0.12% (for the first 12 months, then 0.25%) Fidelity FBTC 0.0% (for the first few months, then 0.25%) As you can see, the difference in expense ratios is substantial. For large institutional investors or even retail investors conscious of fees, switching from GBTC to a lower-cost ETF can result in significant savings over time. This fee discrepancy, combined with potential profit-taking and market uncertainty, likely fuels the ongoing outflows from GBTC. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Still a Promising Investment Avenue? Despite these recent outflows, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are still relatively new investment products in the U.S. market. Their introduction has been a game-changer, providing traditional investors with easier access to Bitcoin exposure within regulated frameworks. Benefits of Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Accessibility: ETFs are easily accessible through traditional brokerage accounts, simplifying Bitcoin investment for a broader audience. Regulation and Security: ETFs operate within regulatory frameworks, offering a degree of security and investor protection that might be lacking in direct Bitcoin ownership. Liquidity: ETFs offer high liquidity, allowing investors to buy and sell shares easily during market hours. Diversification: Bitcoin ETFs can be used for portfolio diversification, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin and, consequently, Bitcoin ETFs remain volatile investments. Price swings can be significant and rapid. Fees: Expense ratios, while varying, do represent a cost that investors need to consider, impacting overall returns. Market Sentiment: ETF flows can be heavily influenced by market sentiment, leading to periods of both inflows and outflows, as we are currently witnessing. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and related investment products is still evolving, which could introduce uncertainties. Actionable Insights: Navigating Bitcoin ETF Investments So, what should investors make of these Bitcoin ETF outflows ? Here are some actionable insights: Don’t Panic: One day or even three days of outflows do not necessarily indicate a long-term trend reversal. Market fluctuations are normal. Look at the Bigger Picture: Assess the overall trend of Bitcoin ETF flows over a longer period, not just short-term movements. Consider Your Investment Horizon: If you are a long-term investor in Bitcoin, short-term ETF outflows might be less concerning than for short-term traders. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different asset classes, including within the crypto space, is a prudent strategy. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory developments, and factors influencing crypto prices and ETF flows. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of the Crypto ETF Market The recent Bitcoin ETF outflows serve as a reminder of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the $103.9 million net outflow on April 7th is noteworthy, it’s essential to analyze these movements within a broader context. Spot Bitcoin ETFs remain a significant development in the crypto investment landscape, offering both opportunities and challenges. By staying informed, understanding market dynamics, and adopting a balanced investment approach, investors can navigate the waves of the crypto ETF market and potentially benefit from the long-term growth of digital assets.

Druckenmiller says in a post on the social media platform X that he does “not support tariffs exceeding 10%.” The former hedge fund manager says he made his stance on tariffs “abundantly clear” in an interview with CNBC about two months ago. At the time, Druckenmiller said that tariffs of up to 10% would assist the US in raising revenues. “In a perfect world, I would not be for a 10% tariff, but we’re not in a perfect world. As you know, we have a big fiscal problem – mandatory spending plus interest expenses are literally 100% of revenues right now. And both sides of the aisle have said they are not about to cut entitlements, which is the elephant in the room. Because of that, we need pay-fors. So our main choices are an income tax and a consumption tax, like tariff. So when I say tariffs are the lesser of the two evils in terms of those two, because we have a fiscal problem, we need revenues. Tariffs will generate revenues. We also have a private savings problem in this country – they’re far too low. So I think a lot of economists who are out raising the alarm bells about tariffs would probably be fine with a consumption tax. To me, tariffs are simply a consumption tax that foreigners pay for some of it. Now, there’s a risk of retaliation. But as long as we stay in the 10% range and I think so-called fear of Donald Trump, I think the risks are overblown relative to the rewards. The rewards are not high, it’s more like they’re the lesser of two evils.” Last week, President Trump signed an executive order imposing a 10% tariff on all imported goods entering the US. He also issued a proclamation detailing “reciprocal tariffs” on dozens of specific countries, effective April 9th, with rates totaling up to 54% on China.

However, the price still faces a key support zone, and if this level is breached, the asset could experience a substantial downturn. XRP Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart XRP recently dumped hard by double digits, driven by a risk-off market sentiment and distribution behavior linked to global tariff tensions. This downward pressure pushed the price below the critical 200-day moving average at $1.8, reinforcing bearish sentiment as market participants shift toward safer assets like gold. However, Ripple is now approaching a significant support region near the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $1.6, which aligns with the wedge’s lower boundary. This area is expected to act as a strong support, potentially leading to consolidation. However, if selling pressure intensifies and the price breaks below this level, a deeper downtrend toward lower levels will become increasingly likely. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, XRP’s recent surge in selling pressure led to a breakdown below the lower boundaries of both the expanding wedge and the descending flag pattern at $1.8, strong bearish signals. Despite this, the asset has since rebounded, retracing toward the broken level and testing the last supply zone at $2. If Ripple faces rejection at this resistance, the bearish breakout will be confirmed, increasing the likelihood of another downward leg toward the $1.5 threshold.

Instead, he is eyeing two potential catalysts that could push it back up: the U.S. Federal Reserve or China’s central bank. The BitMEX co-founder is arguing that if the U.S. doesn’t ease monetary policy, China’s yuan devaluation will drive capital into the number one cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s Fate Tied to Central Bank Moves In a series of posts on X, Hayes declared that either the Fed or the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will trigger the next crypto surge. According to him, the catalyst could be currency manipulation, capital flight, or monetary easing. Citing past trends, the analyst claimed that a devaluation of the yuan often drives Chinese investors toward Bitcoin. “It worked in 2013, 2015, and can work in 2025,” he wrote , warning his followers not to dismiss China’s role in shaping crypto cycles. In both years, capital outflows from the Asian giant correlated with crypto rallies, and Hayes is betting on history to repeat itself. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou also echoed this thesis, stating, “Whenever RMB drops, a lot of Chinese capital flows into BTC. Bullish for BTC.” The yuan recently weakened past a key psychological threshold of 7.20 per dollar, its lowest point since late 2023. On April 8, PBOC set its daily fixing at 7.2038, a move Bloomberg described as easing its grip amid an intensifying trade war with the United States. This triggered a flurry of online commentary, with the Maelstrom Fund CIO dramatically amplifying the message: “CNY deval is on like Donkey Kong!” However, other reactions were mixed. Some members of the crypto community questioned the scale of the effect, while others pointed to alternative safe havens like gold. Still, many echoed Hayes’ optimism. “Don’t sleep in China, fam,” one user wrote. “If it keeps dropping, Chinese investors might FOMO into Bitcoin like 2013 & 2015.” Rollercoaster Week BTC has endured quite a bit of volatility over the past few days. Last week, it swung from $81,500 to $88,500 before crashing hard to $74,000. The latest dip came when U.S. President Donald Trump escalated his trade war with China, threatening to slap an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports, pushing the total rate to over 100%. Rumors of a 90-day delay on the imposition of the taxes sparked a brief price hike, but when they were quickly debunked, the news sent Bitcoin tumbling again. Hayes, however, didn’t flinch. Even as the cryptocurrency slid below his previously suggested support at $76,500, he doubled down , urging investors to buy the dip. Currently, BTC is trading a few dollars short of $79,000, having gained 4.2% in the last 24 hours. Still, the uptick hasn’t been enough to overturn losses made across different periods, with the asset 8.1% in the red over the past month. While it also dipped 5.3% in seven days, its performance was slightly better than the broader crypto market which shed nearly 9% in that time.

On April 8, 2025, the Federal Court approved the regulator’s application to wind down the corporate companies. Notably, Australia’s initiative underscores the country’s commitment to fostering a secure crypto space. The move aims to tackle the growing issue of crypto scams and fraudulent activities masquerading as legitimate companies. Australia Cracks Down on Crypto Scams: 95 Companies Targeted Australia’s Securities and Investments Commission has sought the court’s approval to shut down 95 firms reportedly connected to crypto scams. The Federal Court of Australia signaled a green light to the securities watchdog to wind down the companies. Reportedly, these companies have been involved in crypto investment and romance scams, often known as pig butchering scams. Under the disguise of legitimate businesses, these companies deceived customers into investing in fraudulent crypto platforms. In pig butchering scams, the hackers build fake online relationships to gain victims’ trust, ultimately manipulating them into the scheme. What Are Pig Butchering Scams? Explain ASIC Deputy Chair Significantly, ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court identifies the pig butchering scams as “hydras.” She warned that eliminating one scam will only lead to the emergence of two more, highlighting the challenges in combating these ever-evolving threats. Further, Sarah Court stated, ASIC believes many of these companies were set up with the aim of providing a veneer of credibility by purporting to provide genuine services. This action has shut these companies down and protects consumers from entities with no proper management or control, including some that were associated with potentially fraudulent activity. Interestingly, the ASIC’s crackdown comes following India’s arrest of five individuals involved in Japan-linked crypto scams worth $700k. Australia Takes Measures Against Crypto Fraud: Know More The ASIC is actively making efforts to disrupt the increasing fraudulent activities connected to crypto. Sarah Court posited that the regulator dismantles over 130 scam websites every week. In addition, the ASIC is working to prevent the growth of pig butchering and other crypto scams. “Our ongoing work to uplift and improve our registry system will also help to prevent conduct such as this from occurring in the future,” stated Court. Recently, crypto exchange Deribit released a warning against increasing crypto job scams. The platform stated that scammers attract job seekers, impersonating as prominent crypto firms.

The FSB's Nomination Committee agreed to recommend that Bailey take on the role for a three year term from the beginning of July, it said in a statement on Monday . The Group of Twenty (G20) tasked the FSB with coordinating the delivery of a regulatory framework for crypto-assets. In July 2023, the FSB finalised its recommendations for the regulation of crypto-assets and global stablecoin arrangements, ""which have characteristics that may make threats to financial stability more acute,"" the body's website said .

""This positions him well to guide the FSB forward, with a focus on ensuring the successful implementation of agreed reforms.” Knot's term as FSB chair will end in June.

Trump’s April 2 announcement of reciprocal import tariffs sent shockwaves through global equity and crypto markets. The measures include a 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods, effective April 5, with higher levies — such as a 34% tariff on Chinese imports — set to begin on April 9. However, the tariff negotiations may only be “posturing” for the US to reach an agreement with China, according to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor. “In the end, almost all the other tariff negotiations and rhetoric are all about getting China to agree a deal,” Pal wrote in an April 8 X post , adding: “That is the big prize and both China and the US understand it and need it. Everything else is negotiation posturing. China needs a weaker $ and the US needs tariffs.” Source: Raoul Pal “Also, the US is trying to shut down China tariff arbitrage using other channels such as Mexico or Vietnam,” Pal said.

How long did it take to recover after previous crypto market crashes?,https://crypto.news/black-monday-how-long-recover-crypto-market-crashes/,"Stock and crypto markets crashed on Apr. 7, 2025. Media dubbed this day a Black Monday, similar to Black Thursday of 2020, Black Monday of 1987, and other “black” dates of the strongest market crashes. What does history teach us? How far are we from recovery? As the Trump Administration waged the trade war and imposed tariffs on dozens of countries on a ‘Liberation Day’ (Apr. 2, 2025), markets began to shake, eventually plummeting on the Monday morning of April 7 as Trump didn’t show signs of changing his mind. Experts warn about the possible recession. Table of Contents How bad was the downfall, aka Black Monday? Was it the worst single-day downfall in the history of crypto? What’s next? How bad was the downfall, aka Black Monday? The crypto market downfall was pretty severe. On Apr. 7, Bitcoin lost around 7.7% in 24 hours, while other top cryptocurrencies saw harsher losses: Ether, Solana, and XRP lost around 20%, BNB saw around 9% decline, etc. The prices retraced by 3 to 5%. Around $600 million in leveraged crypto positions were liquidated within 24 hours.

At some point, the rumors about the potential 90-day pause on tariffs for all countries except for China helped to soften the downfall. Soon, the White House denied these claims, calling them fake news. The day closed with a slight decline of under 1%. Nasdaq saw the highest single-day amplitude since 2008.

The market crash may continue as the main factors behind it (trade war and aggressive rhetoric towards Canada and Greenland) persist. Was it the worst single-day downfall in the history of crypto? The April 7 Bitcoin crash, by far, wasn’t the worst single-day price drop. There was only one major drop in the stock and crypto market in Bitcoin’s history. It was a COVID-19-related sell-off in the spring of 2020. Mar 12, 2020, saw a 50% drop, following giving COVID-19 a pandemic status by the World Health Organization. The world stock market was in a panic, and traders needed cash, so they were selling everything they had, including crypto. What’s important is that the other day, the BTC price began to rise. Twenty-four hours after the crash, it regained over half of its value, fully recovering by the end of April. The stimulus payments handed by the government in 2020 and 2021 played a crucial role in the recovery of the crypto market. According to the Harris Poll, nearly 10% of Americans used stimulus payments to invest in crypto. Such an inflow of retail investors helped the market to recover quickly. On top of the 2020 Black Thursday, there were other days when Bitcoin prices experienced substantial downfalls. In April 2013, Mt Gox, an exchange responsible for 70% of crypto trading at that time, suspended its operations for 24 hours to cool down the market. The BTC price fell from $100 to $55. By the end of April, the price was already above $130. An FTX exchange collapse in November 2022 caused a single-day 15% drop in the Bitcoin price when it dropped from $18.5k to $15.7k. It took a couple of months for the market to fully recover from the decline, when whales like Tim Draper and Michael Saylor made a series of BTC purchases. What’s next? Cointelegraph quotes the founder of MN Consultancy, Michael van de Poppe, as saying that Liberation Day is the climax of uncertainty. Soon, the big players will understand the changing conditions, and the market will start recovering. In Poppe’s opinion, the tariffs may stay in effect from 6 to 12 months. Several days in, the countries are still exchanging threats and demands. It seems that the uncertainty climax may take longer. In the past, Bitcoin has shown its ability to rebound during economic turmoil. Hopefully, this time, it won’t be something new.

Understanding these cycles is crucial for navigating the crypto space effectively. Currently, the spotlight is firmly on Bitcoin Season , as indicated by the latest Altcoin Season Index reading. What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Does it Matter? The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool developed by CoinMarketCap (CMC) to gauge the prevailing sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. It essentially tells us whether Bitcoin is outperforming altcoins , or vice versa. Think of it as a crypto weather vane, pointing towards the dominant trend. Here’s a breakdown of what the index measures and why it’s significant: Measurement: The index analyzes the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) listed on CMC over the past 90 days. Comparison: It compares the performance of these altcoins against Bitcoin . Threshold for Altcoin Season: An Altcoin Season is declared when at least 75% of the top 100 coins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Threshold for Bitcoin Season: Conversely, a Bitcoin Season is in effect when 25% or fewer of these coins have outperformed Bitcoin . Index Range: The Altcoin Season Index score ranges from 1 to 100, providing a clear numerical representation of the market’s leaning. Currently, the Altcoin Season Index stands at a low 18, as reported at 00:30 UTC on April 8. This score, unchanged from the previous day, firmly places the crypto market in Bitcoin Season . But what does this really mean for you as a crypto enthusiast or investor? Decoding Bitcoin Season: What Does an Index of 18 Signify? An Altcoin Season Index of 18 is a strong indicator that Bitcoin is currently dominating the crypto market . When the index is this low, it signifies that a vast majority of altcoins are not keeping pace with Bitcoin’s price appreciation over the past three months. Essentially, Bitcoin is leading the charge, and altcoins are, on average, underperforming relative to the king of crypto. Let’s break down the implications of Bitcoin Season : Capital Flow to Bitcoin: During Bitcoin Season , we often see capital flowing into Bitcoin from altcoins . Investors may perceive Bitcoin as a safer haven during times of market uncertainty or simply see more immediate upside in Bitcoin . Bitcoin Price Momentum: Bitcoin Season can fuel further upward momentum for Bitcoin’s price as demand increases. Altcoin Underperformance: While some altcoins might still perform well individually, the general trend during Bitcoin Season is that altcoins as a whole tend to underperform compared to Bitcoin . Trading Strategies Shift: Traders and investors may adjust their strategies to focus more on Bitcoin trades and potentially become more selective with their altcoin investments. Navigating the Crypto Market During Bitcoin Season: Opportunities and Challenges Bitcoin Season presents a unique set of opportunities and challenges for participants in the crypto market . Understanding these can help you make more informed decisions. Opportunities in Bitcoin Season: Bitcoin Focused Trading: For traders, Bitcoin Season can offer concentrated trading opportunities around Bitcoin’s price movements. Volatility and volume in Bitcoin are often heightened during these periods. Accumulating Bitcoin: Long-term investors who believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential may see Bitcoin Season as a favorable time to accumulate more Bitcoin , especially if they anticipate an eventual altcoin season to follow. Identifying Strong Altcoins: Even in Bitcoin Season , some altcoins will still demonstrate resilience and outperformance. This period can be an opportunity to identify fundamentally strong altcoins that are bucking the trend and may be poised for significant gains when market conditions shift. Challenges in Bitcoin Season: Altcoin Portfolio Drag: If your portfolio is heavily weighted towards altcoins , a prolonged Bitcoin Season can lead to underperformance compared to simply holding Bitcoin . Missed Altcoin Gains (Potentially): While altcoins may underperform on average, there’s always the risk of missing out on explosive gains in specific altcoins , even during Bitcoin Season . Market analysis and selective investment are key. Market Sentiment Swings: The crypto market is known for its rapid sentiment shifts. While we are currently in Bitcoin Season , this could change relatively quickly. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial. Actionable Insights: How to Respond to Bitcoin Season So, the Altcoin Season Index is at 18, confirming Bitcoin Season . What should you do with this information? Here are some actionable insights: Review Your Portfolio Allocation: Assess your current crypto portfolio allocation. Are you heavily weighted in altcoins ? Consider rebalancing if you believe Bitcoin Season will persist. Focus on Bitcoin Analysis: Pay close attention to Bitcoin price charts, news, and on-chain metrics. Understanding Bitcoin’s trajectory is paramount during Bitcoin Season . Selective Altcoin Research: Don’t completely ignore altcoins . Use this time to research fundamentally strong projects that may be undervalued or have upcoming catalysts. Look for altcoins showing relative strength against Bitcoin . Manage Risk: Crypto markets are volatile. Bitcoin Season or not, manage your risk appropriately. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider using stop-loss orders and diversifying across different asset classes. Stay Informed: Keep track of the Altcoin Season Index and other market indicators. Market conditions can change rapidly. Stay updated with the latest crypto news and analysis. Conclusion: The Rhythmic Dance of Bitcoin and Altcoins The Altcoin Season Index serves as a valuable compass, guiding us through the cyclical nature of the crypto market . The current reading of 18 emphatically points towards Bitcoin Season , highlighting Bitcoin’s current dominance. While Bitcoin takes center stage, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is a dynamic ecosystem. Altcoin Seasons will inevitably return. Understanding these cycles, adapting your strategies, and staying informed are the keys to navigating the exciting, and sometimes turbulent , world of cryptocurrencies.

What set this operation apart wasn’t just the financial toll — but its sinister use of AI tools and deepfakes to impersonate trusted figures and manipulate emotions. According to an official statement issued by Spain’s national police on April 7, the scammers built a global web of deception, luring individuals with AI-generated ads featuring fake endorsements from recognizable public figures. These advertisements promised sky-high returns on crypto investments with “zero risk,” preying on both curiosity and desperation. Once a victim took the bait, the fraud didn’t end — in fact, it evolved. The criminals re-engaged their targets two more times under different guises, pretending to be investment managers and even government officials, offering to recover the stolen funds in exchange for upfront fees. Tragically, many victims complied, unknowingly falling into the same trap multiple times. Crypto Scam Schemes Reimagined Investigators revealed that the group employed advanced algorithms to profile and select potential victims, refining their target base rather than casting a wide net. Once identified, these individuals were hit with sophisticated marketing campaigns through social media and websites they frequented, many of which included deepfake videos mimicking personalities and financial advisors. In some cases, scammers went as far as initiating fake romantic relationships to gain trust before striking with a financial proposition. When victims attempted to withdraw their supposed earnings and discovered their funds were gone, the criminals continued to exploit them with follow-up scam—each designed to appear more legitimate than the last. By the time Spanish police intervened, the syndicate had crafted a complex web of fake companies, used over 50 false identities, and laundered the stolen funds through various channels. During the raid on the alleged ringleader’s residence, authorities confiscated phones, laptops, hard drives, counterfeit documents, and even a simulated firearm. Criminals Under Scrutiny Across Borders While six arrests have been made in Spain, law enforcement hinted that the network has international tentacles, with suspects identified in multiple countries. Charges against those arrested include fraud, money laundering, and document forgery under an organized criminal structure.

Here's His Latest Sales Volume!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/founder-of-decentralized-finance-defi-protocol-continues-to-sell-his-own-tokens-heres-his-latest-sales-volume/,"Michael Egorov, founder of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve Finance, has resumed selling his CRV tokens as crypto markets are in a modest recovery phase, according to on-chain monitoring platform Spot On Chain. Curve Finance Founder Continues CRV Token Sale, Sells $108K Amid Market Recovery On Tuesday, Egorov sold 236,457 CRV tokens worth around $108,000, marking his latest round of profit-taking after weeks of subdued activity. Spot On Chain data shows that Egorov has sold a total of 3.083 million CRV tokens since March 24 at an average price of $0.527 per token, generating approximately $1.62 million in revenue. Egorov’s latest sell-off comes as the broader cryptocurrency market is stabilizing following a sharp correction that saw Bitcoin drop below $75,000 and DeFi token prices come under pressure. Michael Egorov’s CRV token sale has been closely watched by the DeFi community given the founder’s significant holdings and the potential market impact of his transactions. In previous years, Egorov had sold large amounts of CRV and faced criticism from investors concerned about price pressure on the token. Curve Finance remains one of the largest decentralized exchanges (DEX) focused on stablecoin and liquidity pool trading, but CRV’s price performance has lagged behind broader market trends amid ongoing token unlocks and sell-offs. Despite Egorov’s recent sell-off, CRV’s price has shown relative resilience, holding above $0.40 as of Tuesday, reflecting improving sentiment in the crypto sector. While the token remains significantly down from its all-time high, it has benefited from renewed investor interest in DeFi protocols amid speculation of falling interest rates in the United States. *This is not investment advice.

In this article, we’ll unpack the several positives that could come out of this, how it’s a telling sign that the industry is leaning towards cryptos that reward HODLers, and what are the best presales you could buy right now. Impact of WLFI’s Stablecoin Airdrop Decision This particular move will serve several purposes. First, it’s an excellent way to reward and thank $WLFI token holders who have supported the project from the onset. Second, it allows WLFI to test the airdrop system to ensure the infrastructure is working as expected. Testing the airdrop mechanism in a live setting is a necessary step to ensure smart contract functionality and readiness – WLFI Last but not least, it will also be good marketing for the $USD1 stablecoin, increasing its visibility and awareness before a broader market rollout. The good thing is that there’s no minimum amount of $WLFI tokens that you need to hold to be eligible for the airdrop – every holder gets a piece of the cake. The exact time and amount of the airdrop are yet unknown. Trump’s Vested Interest Ever since Trump’s election as the president, lawmakers have raised concerns over his active involvement in the crypto markets. Democrats also floated a proposal that would bar cabinet members, presidents, and their families from launching their own tokens. This was done after Trump and First Lady Melania launched their own meme coins, $TRUMP and $MELANIA, just before the oath-taking ceremony. Plus, out of WLFI’s $550M token sales, around $390M flowed from DT Marks DEFI LLC, an entity linked to the Trump family. However, this proposed airdrop is a testament to the benefits of early investments in promising projects. Besides buying tokens at a low price, you could get perks like governance rights, airdrops, and exclusive access to features that are not usually available to regular investors. If you’re also looking to buy some crypto assets in their early stages, here are some new meme coins on presale you cannot miss out on. 1. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – Best Presale Right Now Offering Exciting Benefits for Content Creators and Fans SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is freshly out on presale, but its performance already suggests it could be the next crypto to explode . The SUBBD platform is a decentralized ecosystem offering AI-powered automation and tokenization, aiming to revolutionize how online content creators interact with their followers. This way, creators will be able to better manage the content they publish. As for the fans, they’ll enjoy exclusive access to their favorite creators’ content, who will be incentivized to gatekeep it on SUBBD. To make the most of the SUBBD platform, though, you must buy $SUBBD, the platform’s native token and one of the best cryptos to buy now . $SUBBD holders will get subscription discounts, early-bird access to upcoming features, loyalty benefits, and, of course, staking rewards. What’s more, as per SUBBD Token’s whitepaper , the platform will soon launch AI-powered influencer creation and image generation tools, live streams, and a full-blown app for creators. Considering SUBBD’s unique value proposition – as well as its clear-cut roadmap – it’s hardly a surprise that its presale, which launched just a few days ago, has already crossed the $100K mark. One $SUBBD is currently available for only $0.0551, but interested investors should hurry up because the price will increase in less than 26 hours from now. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – AI Agent Token Offering Crypto Investment Advice MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is another top altcoin on presale that unlocks its holders a slew of mind-blowing perks and real-life benefits. It’s a self-evolving and fully autonomous AI agent that lives on the internet – on dApps and social media platforms like X, to be precise. There, it talks to crypto influencers and traders and soaks in their biases and opinions on crypto. Next, MIND of Pepe uses its cutting-edge hive-mind intelligence to comb through all the data it has collected and find out which cryptocurrencies enjoy the market’s favor and are, therefore, worth investing in. Simply put, MIND of Pepe is an AI agent coin that will study the online chatter surrounding crypto to identify tokens most likely to generate returns. Another reason our $MIND price prediction suggests that it could reach 0.0263 by 2030 is that the developers will soon lend it the ability to launch its own tokens. Because MIND will create these cryptos based on what’s trending, they’ll be in a pole position to climb higher. It’s worth noting, though, that the only way you get access to MIND of Pepe’s insights and purchase recommendations is by becoming a $MIND token holder. $MIND is currently on presale ($7.8M+ raised), and each token is selling for just $0.0036965. Here’s how to buy it . 3. Bitcoin Pepe ($BPEP) – Popular New Crypto Project Building Debut Meme L2 on Bitcoin Although BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is inarguably the best Bitcoin-themed meme coin on the market right now, Bitcoin Pepe’s mission of creating the first-ever meme coin Layer-2 on the Bitcoin blockchain is nothing to sniff at, either. You could say $BPEP is essentially taking a leaf out of Solana’s book, as it’s looking to create a native infrastructure for the best meme coins on Bitcoin itself. To do this, Bitcoin Pepe plans to combine Solana’s speed and low fees with Bitcoin’s liquidity. This will not only ensure that transactions are executed quickly but also motivate meme coin degens not to shy away from making multiple trades (or scalps). If you like what you see and want to back Bitcoin Pepe, consider becoming an investor in it. The token, $BPEP, is currently on presale, meaning you can grab it at a low price of $0.0295. The project has raised an impressive $6.25M so far and is easily among the best low-cap cryptos to buy now . Bottom Line The best presales typically offer handsome rewards to loyal HODLers, which is also a smart way of generating hype and hopping onto the list of the top trending cryptos . However, even then, they’re rarely immune to the larger crypto market’s mood, which can be pretty volatile. Therefore, in addition to considering exclusive holder benefits, also look at the project’s fundamentals. And most importantly, do your own research before investing.

Dalio argued that tariffs are mere “symptoms of five underlying forces reshaping the global order,” including rapidly mounting debt, domestic politics, a shift in how geopolitical power is wielded, acts of nature, and how technological innovations such as AI impact the world’s economy. Dalio argues that Trump’s tariffs are just part of what drives everything https://t.co/Xpdl8fYoBg — Ray Dalio (@RayDalio) April 7, 2025 Dalio started by saying that a huge amount of attention is currently being “justifiably” paid to the announced ‘Trump tariffs’ and their “very big impacts on markets and economies” while very little attention is being paid to the circumstances that caused them and the biggest disruptions that are likely still ahead. He pointed out that people mostly overlooked the more important forces that drove “just about everything,” including the tariffs. Bitcoin’s decline below the $75K level less than 24 hours ago, according to on-chain data, coupled with the broader crypto market’s rapid 7% drop over the past weekend since “Liberation Day” point to what Dalio described as a “classic breakdown of the major monetary, political, and geopolitical orders” rather than simply a reaction to trade policy. Dalio argued that the “interconnectedness” of trade and capital flows means that when the “unsustainable debt” conditions and “breakdown of international order” materialized into concrete policy actions, the resulting flight to safety affected all risk assets simultaneously. Trump threatened on April 7 to raise the tariff on Chinese goods by an additional 50%, to which China–through the Ministry of Commerce–responded that it would “resolutely take countermeasures” to protect its “interests and rights.” The announcement also set a 49% tariff for Cambodia, 46% for Vietnam, and 44% for Sri Lanka, while the reciprocal goods tariff was 32% for Taiwan and 26% for India. The European Union was hit with a 20% tariff. “While these tariff announcements are very important developments and we all know that President Trump caused them, most people are losing sight of the underlying circumstances that got him elected president and brought these tariffs about.” – Ray Dalio Dalio, however, claimed that tariffs made local companies less efficient because global supply chains were suppressed but more survivable as long as domestic consumers could still buy enough of their goods. Trump implies that his tariffs led to the rebirth of America Trump announced that April 2, 2025, will “forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, America’s destiny was reclaimed, and Americans began to make America wealthy again.” However, leaders of multiple countries, including Canada and China, vowed they would take countermeasures, although they did not immediately provide details. For instance, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said that tariffs “make things work worse, not better” and that the EU was ready to take “firm countermeasures if necessary.” She added that the EU’s immediate response to tariffs was “unity and determination” against Trump’s tariffs. Dalio mentioned that there were “big pressures for these imbalances to be corrected one way or another” and that doing so would change the monetary order in significant ways. He further explained that it was “obviously incongruous” to have both large trade imbalances and large capital imbalances in a “de-globalizing world” in which the major players could not trust that the other major players would not cut them off from the items they needed–which was an American worry. However, Dalio stressed that it is “helpful to keep in mind that what was happening now was just a ‘modern version’ of what had happened many times throughout history.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

This level reflects weakness following a failed hold above the psychological and technical zone of $2.0390, which previously acted as a consolidation base. Major Patterns Bearish Continuation Flag (4H): After a steep drop to $1.69, XRP formed a consolidation channel between $1.82 and $1.90, resembling a bear flag. This typically signals continuation to the downside. A break below $1.82 could confirm further selloff. Head and Shoulders Breakdown (Daily): The daily chart shows a large head and shoulders pattern that broke down from the neckline at $2.03. This pattern implies a medium-term bearish outlook, with targets projecting toward $1.50–$1.60. Double Bottom Attempt (15M): In the short term, a possible double-bottom has formed around $1.69, hinting at a potential bounce. However, confirmation above $1.90 is needed for reversal validation. Indicators Analysis Bollinger Bands: On the 4H and daily charts, price trades near or below the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting high volatility and oversold territory. A reversion to the mean toward the mid-band ($1.97–$2.03) is possible in the short term but faces heavy resistance. MACD: The MACD shows weak recovery signs. On the 4H, histogram bars are turning lighter red, and a bullish crossover may be forming, indicating a slowing bearish momentum. However, confirmation is still pending. RSI: The RSI on the 4H and 1H hovers between 35–40, reflecting bearish bias but not oversold, leaving room for further downside. On the 15M chart, RSI has bounced from oversold territory, offering a short-lived relief rally potential. Volume: Volume surged during the breakdown , signaling strong selling pressure. However, recent candles show declining volume on green candles—suggesting that buyers lack conviction. Support & Resistance Levels Resistance: $1.90, $2.03, $2.26 Support: $1.82, $1.69, $1.50 We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Trade Setup Short Entry: $1.90–$1.95 (near upper channel resistance) Stop Loss: $2.10 (above structure) Take Profit 1: $1.70 Take Profit 2: $1.50 Long Entry (Bounce Play): $1.70 (with tight stop) Target: $1.90–$2.00 (watch volume) Fundamental Perspective XRP faces headwinds due to ongoing SEC litigation, with investor confidence tightly correlated to court outcomes. Additionally, lackluster crypto market sentiment and broader macroeconomic tightening are weighing on altcoins. Despite Ripple’s growing institutional use cases globally, technical structure dominates price direction in the short term. Future Direction XRP remains vulnerable below $2.03 , and without bullish momentum or fundamental catalyst, bearish continuation toward $1.70–$1.50 is likely. A reclaim of $2.05 with volume would be the first sign of a reversal. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Well-crafted prompts are essential — the more specific your instructions, the more accurate and useful ChatGPT’s responses will be. News-based signals work best when combined with broader market context, like Bitcoin trends or altcoin momentum, for a complete trading picture. AI is a tool, not a guarantee — always verify its insights with other research, charts and risk management practices before executing trades. The cryptocurrency market moves fast, and staying ahead of the curve can feel overwhelming — especially for beginners. News plays a huge role in driving crypto prices, but how do you sift through the noise and turn it into actionable trade signals ? Enter ChatGPT, a powerful AI tool that can help you analyze crypto news and spot opportunities . This guide will walk you through how to use ChatGPT (or similar AI tools like Grok ) to transform crypto news into trade signals, step by step. However, note that the examples used in this article are simplified and brief, intended purely for illustration purposes — executing AI-generated crypto trades in the real world requires deeper analysis, broader data inputs and thorough risk management. What are trade signals? Before you dive in, let’s clarify what a trade signal is. A trade signal is a suggestion to buy or sell a cryptocurrency based on specific information — like price trends, market sentiment or breaking news. For example, if a coin’s price drops due to increased supply, it might be a “buy” signal if you think it’s undervalued — or a “sell” if you expect it to fall further. The goal here is to use ChatGPT to help you identify these signals from the news. Now, let’s dive into how you can use ChatGPT to turn crypto news into potential trade signals. Step 1: Gather crypto news To get started, you need some crypto news to analyze. Here’s how to find it: Websites: Check crypto media websites of your choice. Social media: Platforms like X are goldmines for real-time crypto updates — search hashtags like #Bitcoin, #Ethereum, #CryptoNews or any specific project you’re tracking. News aggregators: Use tools like Google News or Feedly with keywords like “cryptocurrency” or “blockchain.” For example, let’s say you find this headline : “Pi Network price nears all-time lows as supply pressure mounts.” Step 2: Open ChatGPT If you’re using ChatGPT, head to the OpenAI website and log in. Then, type your questions or prompts into the chat interface. Step 3: Craft a simple prompt A “prompt” is just a clear instruction you give the AI. For beginners, keep it simple and specific. Tell ChatGPT what news you have and what you want it to do. Below is an example based on the above-selected headline: Prompt and ChatGPT’s response Prompt: “I read this news: ‘Pi Network price nears all-time lows as supply pressure mounts.’ Can you analyze this and tell me if it’s a buy or sell signal for Pi Network? Explain why (in brief).” The image below shows a ChatGPT 4o response analyzing this piece of news. It suggests a sell signal, citing the 126.6 million PI token unlock (1.87% supply increase) as a bearish factor likely to push the $0.65 price lower due to weak demand. Limited exchange listings (e.g., not on Binance) and bearish technicals like the relative strength index (RSI) in oversold territory reinforce this. However, buy confidence is noted for long-term investors, as the all-time low might indicate an oversold condition, hinting at a potential rebound. It also advises caution and further research. Step 4: Ask follow-up questions The first response might not cover everything, as seen above. Dig deeper with follow-ups like: Follow-up prompt 1: “Are there risks to buying Pi Network at its all-time low? Organize your answer in brief points.” The ChatGPT 4o response to the follow-up prompt No. 1 lists the risks of buying Pi Network at its all-time low ($0.65), as shown in the above image. It highlights token unlocks increasing supply and downward pressure, ongoing bearish momentum with no reversal signs, low liquidity due to absence from major exchanges like Binance, limited real-world utility and adoption, a centralized structure raising concerns, and speculative nature, as success hinges on uncertain future developments. This reinforces a cautious approach. Follow-up prompt 2: “What happened to Pi Network’s price in the past when supply increased? Organize your response in brief points.” ChatGPT 4o’s response to follow-up prompt No. 2 explains that token unlocks, like mining rewards, increase supply, often causing sharp price drops. For instance, the April 2025 unlock of 126.6 million PI tokens led to a 77% decline from February highs as demand lagged. This recurring pattern of price falls due to oversupply reinforces the bearish signal for Pi Network. Step 5: Combine news with market context News doesn’t exist in a vacuum. You could ask ChatGPT to factor in broader market trends. For example: Prompt : “Given this Pi Network news, how should I trade if Bitcoin is booming? Keep your answer brief.” ChatGPT 4o’s response to the above prompt advises against buying Pi Network (PI) despite Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) rise. It suggests avoiding PI due to its weak momentum and oversupply, recommending a focus on stronger assets like Bitcoin or altcoins benefiting from the market uptrend. It also advises waiting for PI demand or exchange listings to improve and using stop-losses if attempting to buy the dip, emphasizing capital protection. Step 6: Test and refine AI isn’t perfect — it’s a tool, not a crystal ball. Test its suggestions with small trades or paper trading (simulated trades without real money). Over time, tweak your prompts to get better results. For example: “Analyze this news — “Pi Network price nears all-time lows as supply pressure mounts” — and give me a buy/sell signal with a confidence score.” Caution: Limitations to be aware of The example in this article is based on one news headline and a few prompts. In the real world, successful trading requires analyzing multiple news sources, market trends and technical indicators. Relying on a single news item or prompt can lead to incomplete insights, so always cross-check and diversify your research. Did you know? In 2024, cryptocurrency scams generated a record-breaking $12.4 billion, with over 83% of the fraud tied to high-yield investment schemes and AI-driven “ pig butchering ” scams, according to Chainalysis — highlighting how artificial intelligence is now fueling the next wave of crypto crime. Risks of using ChatGPT-powered crypto trading insights Crypto trading with AI bots and tools like ChatGPT can be powerful, but it’s not without risks. Understanding these pitfalls can help you trade more safely. Market volatility: Crypto prices can swing wildly, and bots may not react well to sudden crashes or pumps. Overreliance on AI: ChatGPT’s signals are based on its interpretation of news, which might miss broader market trends or technical factors. Technical issues: Bot platforms can face downtime, bugs or API connection errors, potentially leading to missed trades or losses. Limited news scope: Relying solely on one news headline (like the Pi Network example) could lead to incomplete analysis. Security risks: If API keys are compromised, your funds could be at risk. Always enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your exchange. Tips for success A few best practices can help you get the most out of ChatGPT-powered trading insights while minimizing risks. Be specific: Vague prompts like “What’s a good trade?” won’t help. Include the news and crypto you’re focused on. Cross-check: Use ChatGPT’s analysis as a starting point, then verify with price charts or other traders’ opinions on X. Stay updated: Crypto moves fast. Feed the AI the latest news for fresh signals. Manage risk: Never trade more than you can afford to lose — AI can guide you, but it’s not foolproof. Start small: Test your bot with a small amount of capital to understand how it performs with ChatGPT’s signals. Diversify signals: Use ChatGPT to analyze multiple news sources, not just one, for a well-rounded strategy. Set stop-losses: Protect your funds by setting stop-loss limits to cap potential losses. Stay informed: Regularly check market trends and news to ensure ChatGPT’s signals align with the bigger picture. Ready to try a new headline? Now that you’ve seen how to turn crypto news into trade signals using ChatGPT, it’s time to put it into action ! Pick a fresh headline and follow the steps above. With practice, you’ll get better at spotting opportunities and making informed trades. However, keep in mind that ChatGPT is not a financial adviser — always assess your own risk tolerance before acting on AI-generated insights.

Ripple (XRP), once a leading player in the market, has faced recent declines, falling to $1.75 after a 23% drop over the last week. As we look to the future, questions remain about XRP’s ability to recover. On the other hand, Coldware (COLD) , a new player in the field, continues to show strength and resilience, trading above $0.006 despite the market's volatility. Coldware’s Steady Growth Amidst Market Turmoil In stark contrast to XRP, Coldware (COLD) has shown remarkable resilience. While XRP grapples with its decline, Coldware has remained relatively stable, trading above $0.006 and showing no signs of slowing down. Coldware has gained attention for its innovative approach to cross-border payments, leveraging hardware-based mining and PayFitechnology to allow users to mine and engage in DeFi directly from their laptops. Unlike traditional projects like XRP, which focus primarily on financial institutions, Coldware (COLD) makes blockchain technology accessible to the average user. This user-friendly approach, combined with its presale success, positions Coldware (COLD) as a strong competitor in the blockchain space, with the potential to grow exponentially as its presale continues into Stage 2. XRP's Decline and Uncertainty for 2025 Ripple’s XRP has faced significant challenges over the past few months. After peaking earlier in the year, XRP has fallen significantly due to a mix of market pressure and regulatory concerns. The announcement of new tariffs from the U.S. has only exacerbated the situation, causing further uncertainty among investors. Despite previous bullish trends, XRP now finds itself below critical price levels, currently trading at $1.75. As the market remains volatile, analysts predict that XRP could continue to face downward pressure. The $1.63 support level will be crucial for XRP, and failure to hold it could lead to further declines, with some predicting a potential drop to $1.27 in the short term. Will XRP Bounce Back? The big question for Ripple (XRP) in 2025 is whether it can bounce back. With the global market in flux and regulatory concerns hovering over its future, XRP will need strong institutional support and a shift in market sentiment to recover. Despite its long history and widespread adoption among financial institutions, XRP’s ability to innovate and keep pace with newer, more versatile projects like Coldware (COLD) will be crucial for its survival in the competitive blockchain ecosystem. The Case for Coldware (COLD) in 2025 Looking ahead to 2025, Coldware (COLD) presents a more attractive option for investors seeking both stability and growth potential. With its hardware integration and DeFi capabilities, Coldware stands apart from traditional blockchain projects like XRP, offering tangible, scalable solutions for cross-border payments. Coldware (COLD) is already experiencing success in its presale, and with Stage 2 set to launch soon, the token is expected to appreciate in value, making it a strong contender in the blockchain payments market. As XRP faces increasing pressure and market uncertainty, Coldware (COLD) could very well emerge as the superior choice for investors looking to capitalize on the future of decentralized finance. Conclusion: Coldware (COLD) Outshines XRP in 2025 As the market shifts, Coldware (COLD) continues to remain strong, while XRP struggles to regain its momentum. Investors are turning their attention to Coldware as the project’s innovative approach to blockchain technology and payments positions it for significant growth in the coming years. With Coldware trading above $0.006 and XRPbattling downward pressure, it’s clear that Coldware (COLD) offers a more attractive alternative for those seeking exposure to the future of decentralized finance. Coldware may well be the token to watch in 2025, while XRP's future remains uncertain.

43076511,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147442,1744114250,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Hopeful Signals: PlanB Predicts Imminent Bitcoin Bull Market as Key Averages Converge,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/planb-bitcoin-bull-market-signals/,"Exciting times might be ahead for Bitcoin enthusiasts! Renowned crypto analyst PlanB, known for his data-driven insights, is suggesting that Bitcoin (BTC) could be on the cusp of a significant uptrend. If you’ve been watching the market closely, you know that predicting the next big move in crypto is always a hot topic. PlanB’s latest analysis focuses on a fascinating technical indicator – the convergence of Bitcoin’s 200-week moving averages. Let’s dive into what this means and why it could signal the start of a fresh Bitcoin bull market . Decoding the Bitcoin Bull Market Signal: 200-Week Moving Averages So, what exactly are these 200-week averages that PlanB is talking about, and why are they important for identifying a potential Bitcoin bull market ? Essentially, the 200-week moving average is a technical analysis tool that smooths out Bitcoin’s price fluctuations over a long period – specifically, 200 weeks. There are two types PlanB mentions: 200-week Geometric Moving Average: This average gives more weight to recent price data but still considers the historical trend over 200 weeks. 200-week Arithmetic Moving Average: This is the standard average, calculated by summing up the closing prices over the last 200 weeks and dividing by 200. Historically, when these two averages get very close to each other, or ‘converge’, it has been a reliable indicator of major shifts in the Bitcoin market. According to PlanB’s analysis, this convergence often precedes the start of robust bull markets. Think of it like a coiled spring – the closer the averages get, the more pent-up energy there might be for a significant price surge. This is why the current convergence is generating buzz and fueling speculation about a new Bitcoin bull market . Why PlanB’s Bitcoin Analysis Matters PlanB is a well-respected figure in the cryptocurrency space, particularly known for his Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model, which attempts to predict Bitcoin’s price based on its scarcity. While the S2F model has had its critics and periods of inaccuracy, PlanB’s broader market analysis is still closely followed by many investors. His insights often cut through the noise and focus on long-term trends and historical patterns. In this instance, PlanB is drawing attention to the historical significance of the 200-week moving averages. His point isn’t solely based on his S2F model but on observed price action and established technical indicators. This adds weight to his assertion that the current convergence could be a strong signal for a potential Bitcoin bull market . It’s crucial to remember that no analysis is foolproof, but PlanB’s track record and the historical data behind the 200-week averages make his perspective noteworthy for anyone tracking the crypto market analysis landscape. Could This Convergence Really Mean a Bitcoin Uptrend? The million-dollar question, of course, is whether this convergence of 200-week averages truly translates into a sustained Bitcoin uptrend . While past performance is never a guarantee of future results, the historical data is compelling. Let’s consider what typically happens when these averages converge: Reduced Risk of Major Crashes: Historically, convergence has been associated with periods where Bitcoin is less likely to experience dramatic price drops. This doesn’t mean volatility disappears, but the downside risk might be somewhat mitigated. Bull Market Ignition: More importantly, these convergence points have often been followed by significant bull markets. Think back to previous Bitcoin bull runs – many of them have been preceded by similar technical setups. Market Sentiment Shift: Such technical signals can also contribute to a shift in market sentiment. When analysts like PlanB highlight these patterns, it can increase investor confidence and attract more capital into Bitcoin, further fueling an Bitcoin uptrend . However, it’s essential to maintain a balanced perspective. The crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors beyond technical analysis, including: Factor Impact on Bitcoin Price Macroeconomic Conditions Inflation, interest rates, and global economic stability significantly impact risk assets like Bitcoin. Regulatory Developments Government regulations, both positive and negative, can drastically alter market sentiment and investor behavior. Institutional Adoption Increased adoption by institutions and corporations can inject substantial capital and credibility into the Bitcoin market. Technological Advancements Developments in blockchain technology and the broader crypto ecosystem can drive innovation and adoption. Therefore, while the 200-week average convergence is an encouraging sign, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. A true and sustained Bitcoin uptrend will likely require a confluence of positive factors across these different domains. Navigating the Potential Bitcoin Bull Market: Actionable Insights If PlanB’s analysis proves accurate and we are indeed on the verge of a Bitcoin bull market , what should you do? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. Don’t rely solely on one analyst’s prediction. Understand the risks involved in the volatile crypto market analysis . Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Bull markets can be exciting, but they also come with increased volatility. Determine your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price. This strategy can help mitigate the risk of buying at market tops and smooth out your entry into the market. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest developments in the crypto space, including regulatory news, technological advancements, and macroeconomic trends. Follow reputable news sources and analysts to stay ahead of the curve in crypto market analysis . Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin bull markets can be exhilarating, but they are also part of a cyclical pattern. Having a long-term perspective and understanding Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term store of value can help you navigate market fluctuations with greater composure. Ultimately, the convergence of the 200-week moving averages, as highlighted by PlanB, offers a hopeful signal for the Bitcoin bull market . While it’s not a guarantee, it’s a historically significant indicator that aligns with the cyclical nature of crypto markets. By staying informed, being prepared, and approaching the market with a balanced perspective, you can position yourself to potentially benefit from any upcoming uptrend.

According to Arkham Intelligence’s data, the Republican President’s crypto holdings fell from a $23 million level to a $1 million level since the start of January this year to date. Let’s take a closer look at some of the most crucial factors that appear to have triggered a sharp decline in the president’s digital asset holdings. Donald Trump’s Crypto Holdings Plummet; Here Are The Tokens Bought According to the latest Arkham data , Donald Trump’s crypto holdings encompassed tokens such as TROG, TRUMP, TUA, MATIC, GUA, WFI, USACOIN, and the stablecoin USDC, among others. All of the abovementioned tokens, except stablecoins, have witnessed a steep decline ever since the year kicked off. Per the data, Trump’s digital asset holdings totaled over $23 million as of mid-January this year. However, following a massive correction in Bitcoin, Ether, and other crypto prices, the President’s portfolio shredded down to $1.15 million as of press time. Crypto Market Correction: What’s Fueling Bears? It’s vital to consider that the 2025 bull cycle halted as U.S. President Donald Trump announced new tariffs , which eventually blew up in his own face. In light of these tariffs, global markets responded by losing alarming values, reflecting investor uncertainty. A hawkish stance from the U.S. Fed, as interest rates were constantly kept unchanged, has added to the heat on risk assets. CoinGape earlier reported that the U.S. JOLTS data also came in weaker than expected, adding to macro heat. In retaliation, the broader crypto market erased concerning values in tandem with the U.S. stock market. Trump’s Crypto Prices Crash The drop in Donald Trump’s crypto portfolio is also attributable to the tokens in it that witnessed a price crash. TROG coin has erased nearly 19% weekly while losing roughly 28% over the past month. The meme token currently trades at $0.000003258. TRUMP coin’s price crashed 22% over the week and erased over 31% the month, exchanging hands at $7.91. The PolitiFi token that once stood among the top 10 coins by market cap is now ranking 49th. Also, MATIC price lost 13% weekly and slumped 26% over the month, trading at $0.1759. Overall, other tokens in the President’s portfolio also crashed in light of the broader trends mentioned above. Triggered by these bearish events, even Donald Trump’s crypto portfolio dropped to $1 million.

Ray Dalio Says Tariff-Fueled Crypto Meltdown Signals Deeper Economic Trouble,https://cryptonews.com/news/is-the-worst-over-ray-dalio-says-tariff-fueled-crypto-meltdown-signals-deeper-economic-trouble/,"Billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio believes the recent crypto and market meltdown, sparked by President Donald Trump’s aggressive new tariff policies, points to a far more serious unraveling of the global financial order than many realize. In a statement released Monday , Dalio, who founded Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, described the current market chaos as a “once-in-a-lifetime” event that signals a broader systemic breakdown. He said that President Trump’s sweeping tariffs, particularly against China, are symptoms of much deeper, long-term forces reshaping the world economy. Trump Threatens 50% Tariff Hike on China; Beijing Vows Swift Retaliation Late Monday, Trump threatened to increase tariffs on Chinese imports by another 50%, prompting a swift response from China’s Ministry of Commerce, which vowed to “resolutely take countermeasures” to protect its economic interests. While acknowledging Trump’s role in triggering the current volatility, Dalio emphasized that the real causes run deeper. “Most people are losing sight of the underlying circumstances that got him elected president and brought these tariffs about,” he wrote. According to Dalio, the chaos is driven by five structural forces: unsustainable debt levels, internal political divisions, evolving geopolitical dynamics, environmental pressures, and technological disruption—especially artificial intelligence. He pointed to the deteriorating U.S.-China debt dynamic as one example of how global financial imbalances have become untenable. “Debt has become unsustainable because of the large imbalance between debtor-borrowers who owe too much and lender-creditors who already hold too much,” Dalio said. Crypto markets, once seen as disconnected from traditional finance, have recently mirrored the volatility of U.S. equities. Bitcoin fell below $75,000 during the weekend sell-off, while the broader crypto market dropped 7%. Dalio sees this move as indicative of the broader collapse of existing monetary, political, and geopolitical frameworks. https://t.co/Xpdl8fYoBg — Ray Dalio (@RayDalio) April 7, 2025 He noted that the interconnectedness of global trade and capital flows means shocks in one area now ripple through all risk assets. As trust erodes, investors flee simultaneously, creating cascading effects across markets. Could China’s Yuan Devaluation Trigger a Bitcoin Bull Run? Hayes Thinks So Meanwhile, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes has argued that China’s response to U.S. tariffs—particularly a potential devaluation of the yuan—could ignite a fresh wave of capital flight into Bitcoin. Drawing parallels to previous years like 2013 and 2015, Hayes argued that similar economic conditions led Chinese investors to turn to BTC as a hedge against currency depreciation. If not the Fed then the PBOC will give us the yachtzee ingredients. CNY deval = narrative that Chinese capital flight will flow into $BTC . It worked in 2013 , 2015, and can work in 2025.

Crypto wasn’t alone in the selloff. U.S. stock futures also plunged Sunday night, heightening fears of a broader market crash. S&P 500 futures fell 5.98%, Nasdaq 100 futures slid 6.2%, and Dow futures dropped 5.5%, all pointing to a chaotic start to the trading week. Prominent hedge fund manager and Trump supporter Bill Ackman publicly urged the administration to pause the tariff escalation for 90 days, warning that the current trajectory could spark an “economic nuclear winter.” The post Is the Worst Over?

Crypto data and analytics platform Artemis Terminal shows that on March 17, 2024, the number of active developers tagged on open-source repositories in a week was 12,380. The number dropped to around 7,600 on March 16, signaling a 38.6% drop in weekly active developers in one year. The number of active developers working across over 1,500 ecosystems is used as an indicator of the Web3 ecosystem’s overall health. Developer activity suggests increased innovation and maintenance of protocols, which contributes to long-term sustainability. Weekly active developers in the crypto space. Source: Artemis Terminal Community calls for more developer-led narratives The drop in developer activity across the Web3 space spurred calls for more developer-led narratives on social media. On X, Optimism contributor Binji Pande said the drop in one of the “clearest signals of long-term health” means that attention shifted, incentives dried up, and speculation moved faster than utility. The developer said there isn’t much to do onchain, while those building real foundations rarely get into the spotlight. The developer said that this could cause the game to collapse. “If nothing meaningful happens onchain, distribution loses its power,” Pande wrote. Pande underscored the need for more support for developers and more teams thinking about the end-to-end products and not just code. “There’s been a lot of narrative-led development, but there should be more development-led narratives,” Panded added . Related: Ethereum devs prepare final Pectra test before mainnet launch Memecoin “casino” replaced real crypto products Responding to Pande, developer Ben Ward said that markets and venture capitalists have rewarded protocols with products for too long. The developer said that the only thing in crypto with a product-market fit is the decentralized finance (DeFi) “memecoin casino.” However, the developer said this is not sustainable, adding that the space is far from building things people want to use. In the first quarter of 2024, memecoins became the most profitable narrative in the Web3 space as it became easier to launch tokens using protocols like Pump.fun. The memecoin frenzy extended into 2025, when the United States President Donald Trump joined in, launching his own memecoin token . Pande said that while the space has come a long way, it may have gone the wrong way.

Ripple Announces New Investment of $1.25 Billion!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/attention-xrp-investors-ripple-announces-new-investment-of-1-25-billion/,"According to breaking news, Ripple announced today that it acquired crypto-friendly brokerage firm Hidden Road for $1.25 billion. The deal will be settled primarily in cash, XRP tokens, and company stock. The acquisition is expected to close in the coming months, pending regulatory approval. This acquisition represents one of the largest deals in the digital assets space. With this acquisition, Ripple becomes the first cryptocurrency company to own and operate a global, multi-asset primary brokerage firm. Hidden Road is one of the world’s fastest growing primary brokerages, providing institutions with a one-stop shop for advanced services including clearing, prime brokerage and financing across foreign exchange (FX), digital assets, derivatives, swaps and fixed income. Hidden Road has a strong business clearing $3 trillion annually in markets with over 300 institutional clients.

Hidden Road will also use Ripple USD (RLUSD) as collateral among its primary brokerage products. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a statement: “We are at an inflection point for the next phase of digital asset adoption. The U.S. market is effectively open for the first time due to increased regulatory burden with the demise of the old SEC, and the market is maturing to meet the needs of traditional finance. “With these positive tailwinds, we continue to pursue opportunities to transform the space at scale, leveraging our positioning and XRP’s strengths to accelerate our business and enhance our existing solutions and technology.” *This is not investment advice.

Simultaneously, he reiterated his view on how the US could have made profits if they had sold BTC to buy gold under the new administration. Peter Schiff Mocks US Bitcoin Reserve Plan; Pushes For Gold Strategy Economist and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has once again criticized Donald Trump’s Bitcoin push. In a recent X post, he said the US would have been in a better financial position if it had chosen gold instead of Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. According to Schiff, the reserve, established on March 6, has already posted a 12% loss in value. In contrast, gold prices have slightly increased during the same period. Schiff said : “So far, the value of the Bitcoin held in that reserve has declined by over 12%. Had the U.S. sold it and added to our gold reserve, not only would we have avoided that loss, but we would now have a 2% gain.” Having said that, the US would have seen a 2% gain instead if it had shifted its focus towards the precious metal. In other words, Schiff reiterated his view that how gold remains the safer bet in uncertain economic times. However, when another user pointed out that the Biden administration had already missed massive BTC gains years ago by selling early, Peter Schiff dismissed the claim. He responded that such comparisons are “irrelevant,” noting that profits or losses should be judged only from the moment the official reserve began. Peter Schiff Warns Of US Recession In a separate post, Schiff also raised red flags over the US economy. He linked Trump’s rising tariff plans to a possible recession and warned investors to brace for a sharp market downturn. According to him, the stock market hasn’t factored in the economic damage such trade policies could cause. He further stated that even with the recent dip and crypto market crash , equities remain overvalued. If a recession hits, the US could face its worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Schiff said even a 50% market drop might not be enough to reflect the true scale of the crisis. Can The US Fed Save The Economy? While Peter Schiff has warned over a potential US Recession after slamming Donald Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve plan, a user said that the recession is unlikely. However, responding to the user, Schiff sarcastically said that only the US Federal Reserve could stop it. However, he warned that doing so would require pumping more liquidity into the system, potentially triggering runaway inflation. Considering that, along with Trump’s recent threat of an additional 50% Tariff on China has fueled market concerns. Meanwhile, despite all these concerns, the market has recorded a strong recovery today, with the BTC price soaring to the $80K mark. However, investors must consider the current macroeconomic woes and other factors before putting their bets amid this uncertain period.

Standard Chartered predicts that XRP will reach $5.50 by the end of this year, $8 by 2026 year-end, $10.40 by the end of 2027, and $12.50 by end-2028. At the time of writing, XRP was trading almost 9% higher at $1.94. The bank noted that XRP rose sixfold following Donald Trump's election victory in November, reflecting expectations that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would drop its appeal against Ripple , and because of the potential approval of XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Such gains are sustainable, the bank said, in part due to leadership changes at the SEC, but also because ""XRP is uniquely positioned at the heart of one of the fastest-growing use cases for digital assets - facilitation of cross-border and cross-currency payments."" ""XRPL is similar to the main use case for stablecoins such as Tether: blockchain-enabled financial transactions that have traditionally been done through traditional financial (TradFi) institutions,"" wrote Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered Bank. Stablecoin transactions are expected to increase tenfold in the next four years, the report said. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold. They play a major role in cryptocurrency markets and are also used for to transfer money internationally. Ripple is also planning to push XRPL into the tokenization space, the bank noted. XRPL is XRP's decentralized public blockchain, and is used for payments. These positive factors mean that XRP should keep up with its larger peer bitcoin (BTC), in terms of price appreciation, the bank said. XRPL suffers from two flaws, the small number of developers and its limited value capture, but these are more than offset by positive tailwinds, the report added.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts also keeping an eye on traditional markets, understanding Forex movements can provide valuable insights into global risk sentiment and potential shifts in capital flows. Recently, financial giant Citi has released its analysis on the Australian Dollar against the Japanese Yen (AUD/JPY), and their outlook might surprise you. Let’s dive into Citi’s AUD/JPY forecast and understand why they predict limited upside for this popular currency pair after it reached key targets. Understanding Citi’s Forex Market Outlook on AUD/JPY Citi, a major player in global financial services, has issued a report suggesting that the bullish run for AUD/JPY might be losing steam. This isn’t just a casual observation; it’s a data-driven analysis based on market trends, economic indicators, and a deep understanding of global financial dynamics. But what exactly does ‘limited upside’ mean, and why should traders, including those interested in crypto, pay attention? Target Achieved: Citi believes that AUD/JPY has already reached its projected target levels. This means that the factors that initially drove the pair upwards may have played out. Shifting Market Dynamics: The global economic landscape is constantly evolving. Changes in interest rates, commodity prices, and geopolitical events can significantly impact currency valuations. Citi’s analysis likely incorporates these shifts. Technical Indicators: Financial institutions like Citi employ sophisticated technical analysis to identify trends and potential reversal points. These indicators might be signaling a slowdown in AUD/JPY’s upward momentum. Risk Sentiment: AUD/JPY is often considered a risk-on currency pair. Changes in global risk appetite can heavily influence its direction. Citi’s outlook might reflect a perceived shift in risk sentiment that could limit further gains. For those familiar with the crypto market’s volatility, the Forex market might seem comparatively stable, but subtle shifts can still present significant trading opportunities and risks. Understanding expert analysis, like Citi’s Forex market outlook , is crucial for making informed decisions, whether you’re trading currencies, stocks, or even cryptocurrencies. What Drives AUD/JPY? Key Factors in Currency Trading Analysis To truly grasp Citi’s perspective, it’s essential to understand the fundamental drivers of AUD/JPY. Several factors interplay to influence the value of this currency pair. Let’s break down some of the key elements that form the basis of any robust currency trading analysis : Factor Impact on AUD/JPY Interest Rate Differentials The difference in interest rates between Australia and Japan is a primary driver. Higher Australian interest rates generally make the AUD more attractive to investors, increasing demand and potentially pushing AUD/JPY higher. Commodity Prices Australia is a major exporter of commodities like iron ore and coal. Rising commodity prices tend to boost the Australian economy and the AUD. Conversely, Japan is a commodity importer, so higher prices can negatively impact the JPY. Global Risk Sentiment AUD/JPY is often seen as a proxy for global risk appetite. In times of economic optimism and low risk aversion, investors tend to favor higher-yielding currencies like the AUD, leading to potential gains in AUD/JPY. Conversely, during periods of uncertainty, investors may flock to safe-haven currencies like the JPY, potentially weakening AUD/JPY. Japanese Yen as a Safe Haven The Japanese Yen is traditionally considered a safe-haven currency. During global economic downturns or periods of heightened risk, investors often seek refuge in the JPY, increasing its demand and potentially causing AUD/JPY to decline. Economic Data Releases Economic data from both Australia and Japan, such as GDP growth, inflation figures, and employment numbers, can significantly impact currency valuations. Strong Australian data generally supports the AUD, while strong Japanese data supports the JPY. By considering these factors, analysts like those at Citi develop their Australian Dollar Yen forecasts. Their ‘limited upside’ view likely stems from an assessment of these factors, suggesting that the current balance may not favor further significant gains for AUD/JPY in the near term. Citi’s AUD/JPY Analysis: Digging Deeper into Limited Upside Citi’s analysis isn’t just a simple statement; it’s a nuanced perspective derived from in-depth market research. To understand the implications of their Citi AUD/JPY forecast, we need to consider the potential reasons behind their view. Why might the upside be limited even after AUD/JPY has reached its targets? Overbought Conditions: After a significant rally, AUD/JPY might be considered ‘overbought’ from a technical analysis perspective. This means that the price has risen too quickly and may be due for a correction or consolidation. Potential Shift in Interest Rate Expectations: While Australia currently has higher interest rates than Japan, future expectations can change. If markets anticipate a potential slowdown in Australian rate hikes or a possible shift in Japanese monetary policy, it could reduce the attractiveness of AUD/JPY. Commodity Price Volatility: While commodity prices have been supportive of the AUD, they are inherently volatile. A downturn in commodity markets could remove a significant tailwind for the Australian Dollar. Global Economic Slowdown Concerns: Growing concerns about a global economic slowdown could dampen risk appetite, potentially favoring safe-haven currencies like the JPY over risk-on currencies like the AUD. Geopolitical Risks: Unforeseen geopolitical events can trigger sudden shifts in market sentiment and currency valuations. Increased global uncertainty could boost demand for safe-haven assets, including the Yen. Understanding these potential headwinds is crucial for anyone involved in currency trading analysis . Citi’s ‘limited upside’ view isn’t necessarily bearish, but it suggests that traders should be cautious about expecting substantial further gains in AUD/JPY without significant new positive catalysts. Actionable Insights: Navigating AUD/JPY in a Limited Upside Scenario So, what does Citi’s analysis mean for traders? Even with a forecast of limited upside, there are still strategies and approaches to consider when dealing with Australian Dollar Yen . Here are some actionable insights: Manage Expectations: Don’t chase aggressive long positions in AUD/JPY expecting rapid gains. Citi’s analysis suggests a more cautious approach might be warranted. Focus on Short-Term Opportunities: Even in a range-bound or consolidating market, short-term trading opportunities can arise. Focus on technical levels and intraday movements. Consider Range Trading Strategies: If AUD/JPY enters a period of consolidation, range trading strategies, such as buying at support and selling at resistance, could be effective. Monitor Key Economic Data: Pay close attention to economic data releases from both Australia and Japan, as well as global economic indicators. Unexpected data can trigger shifts in market sentiment and create trading opportunities. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t over-allocate your trading capital to a single currency pair. Diversification across different currency pairs and asset classes can help manage risk. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest market analysis and news from reputable sources like Citi. Market conditions can change rapidly, and staying informed is crucial for making sound trading decisions. For cryptocurrency traders, understanding Forex dynamics can be a valuable addition to your market knowledge. The principles of risk management, technical analysis, and fundamental analysis apply across different markets, and insights from the Forex world can often provide a broader perspective on global financial trends. Conclusion: A Measured Approach to AUD/JPY Trading Citi’s analysis of limited upside for AUD/JPY serves as a valuable reminder of the importance of measured expectations and informed decision-making in trading. While the pair may have reached its targets, the Forex market is ever-evolving. By understanding the factors influencing AUD/JPY forecast , recognizing potential headwinds, and adopting appropriate trading strategies, market participants can navigate this currency pair effectively even in a potentially less bullish environment.

They are looking for other projects that offer utility and have growth potential. Although these tokens solidified their distinct positions, they face challenges such as dependence on market sentiment, regulation uncertainty, and scalability. Introducing Rexas Finance (RXS), a new crypto coin gaining traction, not for viral tweets or attractive partnerships, but for its fundamental method of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs). By connecting traditional finance with blockchain technology, Rexas Finance might discreetly emerge as one of the most significant success stories in 2025. Why This Crypto Coin Could Outpace SOL, ADA, XRP & DOGE in 2025 Rexas Finance is rapidly positioning itself as the crypto coin to watch in 2025. Going Past Hype: Reasons Investors Are Seeking Alternatives Dogecoin (DOGE) is recognized as the first meme coin and the largest by market cap. Solana is popular for its speed, Cardano for its scholarly approach, and XRP for cross-border transactions. However, despite their popularity, these crypto coins also have their limitations. Solana has been scrutinized for network downtimes, XRP’s regulatory challenges, Cardano’s slow development pace, and DOGE’s lack of utility. Nevertheless, in 2025, the actual growth might occur in different areas. What Distinguishes Rexas Finance? Rexas Finance is developing a straightforward yet impactful idea: converting physical assets such as real estate, commodities, and collectibles into tokens, and providing them as fractional investments. By doing this, it is enabling average investors to access high-value markets more easily Here’s why that matters: Barrier-free entry: Traditional investments in real estate or fine art require significant capital and legal navigation. Tokenization simplifies this with fractional ownership. Liquidity in illiquid markets: While traditional asset markets are often slow-moving, tokenized assets can be traded easily, opening up more flexibility for investors. Diversification in a volatile market: Crypto is famously volatile. By tying digital assets to real-world value, Rexas Finance provides a unique hedge against market swings. Strong momentum: A Closer Look at the RWA Crypto Coin Numbers Rexas Finance isn’t just an idea, it is gaining real traction. 600% presale growth: RXS jumped from $0.03 to $0.20 across 12 presale stages. Over $47 million raised: More than 457 million of the RWA tokens were sold, a number that speaks to rising investor confidence. Upcoming listing: On June 19, 2025, Rexas Finance is set to list on at least three major exchanges, priced at $0.25 per token. This milestone could bring a major liquidity boost and broader exposure. Tokenomics & Tech: Built for Longevity Rexas Finance has implemented deflationary tokenomics with a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens. Token allocations are designated for staking, liquidity pools, and presales, helping to prevent over-dilution and support long-term value. Rexas Finance tokenomics The project also passed a Certik audit, and its listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko have added visibility. To top it off, the Rexas AI Shield offers proactive smart contract security, something many projects only address reactively. Growing Buzz: A Strategic Giveaway To spark early engagement, Rexas Finance is giving away $1 million worth of RXS, with the top 20 participants each set to receive $50,000. The campaign has already garnered over 1.6 million entries, making it one of the most hyped token launches this year, not because of celebrity endorsements but due to its utility-driven promise. The Case for The New Crypto Coin Outperforming SOL, ADA, XRP, and DOGE So why might Rexas Finance outpace these established names in 2025? Grounded in real value: While many top coins rely heavily on network effects or market speculation, RXS derives its strength from asset-backed investment strategies. First-mover in a growing sector: The RWA tokenization space is still relatively young, and Rexas Finance is positioned as a fast-mover, and among the best new cryptocurrencies to invest in. Appeal to institutions: Tokenized assets are attracting the attention of financial giants. As institutions enter the space, Rexas could benefit from being ahead of the curve. Stability with upside: Tying crypto to real-world assets could offer a middle ground that is less risky than meme coins but with higher growth potential than traditional assets. Final Thoughts Rexas Finance isn’t trying to be the next Solana or XRP. It’s playing a different game, connecting blockchain to real-world finance in a way that’s accessible, scalable, and investor-friendly. For those looking to diversify beyond the usual crypto headlines and into projects with meaningful utility, RXS is one to keep on your radar in 2025.

43076928,https://timestabloid.com/?p=63362,1744114975,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Cardano (ADA) Price Action Analysis: Bulls Eye $1 Amid Momentum Surge,https://timestabloid.com/cardano-ada-price-action-analysis-bulls-eye-1-amid-momentum-surge/,"Cardano (ADA) is currently priced at $0.6025, down 1.24%, after a sharp recovery from the $0.5220 support. While the recent bounce shows promise, the broader market structure remains fragile. Here’s a concise analysis across timeframes, technical patterns, indicators, and key levels. Key Patterns across Timeframes Falling Wedge (4H/1H): On the 4-hour and 1-hour charts, a falling wedge pattern has played out. This bullish reversal structure broke to the upside near $0.5520, with ADA now attempting to reclaim the mid-range at $0.5800–$0.6040. A clean break above that level could confirm trend reversal and target $0.6300 next. Double Bottom (30M): The 30-minute chart shows a double bottom at $0.5220, a strong sign of local support. Price is currently testing the neckline at $0.5800. A breakout would affirm short-term upside potential. Bullish Flag (15M): A bullish flag is forming on the 15-minute chart after the bounce. Consolidation under resistance suggests a bullish continuation if volume supports a breakout above $0.5800. Indicator Analysis Bollinger Bands: On the 4H, the price bounced off the lower Bollinger Band and climbed toward the mid-band at $0.6048. A successful close above this level could pave the way to the upper band around $0.6875. BB squeeze on the 1H indicates incoming volatility. MACD: MACD on the 4H and 1H has just crossed bullish, and histogram bars have turned positive—signaling a momentum shift in favor of buyers. RSI: RSI across all timeframes has risen from oversold zones (below 30) to neutral (45–55), suggesting bullish momentum is building but not yet overbought—leaving room for further upside. Volume: Volume surged on the initial bounce from $0.5220, showing strong buying interest. However, the continuation volume remains moderate. Sustained upward pressure requires increased participation. Support & Resistance Support: $0.5520, $0.5220 Resistance: $0.6048, $0.6300, $0.6875 Fundamental Perspective Cardano’s fundamentals remain intact: active development, ongoing scaling improvements (Hydra), and growing DeFi adoption. However, the price remains reactive to Bitcoin movements and broader risk sentiment. ADA typically lags in breakout performance but holds mid-term potential for accumulation phases. Price Target ADA’s breakout from the falling wedge and recent bullish signals suggest a short-term upside toward $0.6048, with a potential extension to $0.63–$0.6875 and $1.0. A rejection at $0.5800 would likely bring ADA back to test $0.5520. Bulls must reclaim key resistance with volume to sustain this move.
