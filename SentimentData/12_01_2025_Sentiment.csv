Ethereum’s Role and Future in Blockchain Ecosystem Ethereum stands out for its innovation and versatility in the blockchain field. It is a leader in smart contract technology and decentralized applications, or dApps. Its ecosystem includes decentralized finance and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon to improve transaction speeds. Ethereum began in 2015 and shifted to a Proof-of-Stake model in 2022, enhancing its focus on decentralization. The planned sharding upgrade aims to improve scalability and reduce user costs. Ether (ETH), the network’s native currency, plays a key role. It is used for transaction fees and as a reward for stakers. Looking ahead, Ethereum appears promising based on historical price patterns, with significant growth expected by 2030. Conclusion While established tokens like ETH may see steady growth in the current bull market, Catzilla offers a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale stages. With governance features, loyalty rewards, and passive staking options, Catzilla aims to unite enthusiasts seeking financial freedom. Acquiring $CATZILLA tokens allows participation in a project poised for significant short-term gains.

Like many industry experts, Nate Geraci believes a major shift is coming to the ecosystem this year. XRP and Solana ETF Prospect In 2025 According to Nate Geraci, spot XRP and Solana ETF products will gain approval this year. As reported earlier by Coingape, asset manager VanEck filed the first Solana ETF product in the US in June 2024. Since then, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has welcomed other SOL ETF applications from Grayscale , Canary Capital, and 21Shares. While the Solana products are still under review, Canary Capital filed for XRP ETF in October 2023. This filing changed the crypto ETF outlook and inspired other asset managers to join the trend. While there is no definitive update from the US SEC, the confidence for approval remains high. The change in the US SEC leadership is a major catalyst many are citing will drive the approval. President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkins as US SEC Chair in the coming administration. Atkins is expected to redirect the SEC from its strict approach to crypto under Gary Gensler. Like other industry experts, Geraci believes 2025 will see the launch of Solana and XRP ETF products. The Nate Geraci Crypto ETF Predictions The ETF Store President shared 10 predictions on what to expect in the crypto ETF space. He believes spot Bitcoin ETFs will surpass the physical gold ETFs in assets under management. After one year of launch, several Bitcoin ETF milestones are now on record. The Bitcoin ETF products topped $150 billion Assets Under Management (AUM), a feat that took gold 20 years to achieve. Beyond the approval forecast for Solana and XRP ETF, Geraci also believes the U.S. SEC will approve Ethereum ETF staking this year. My 10 crypto-related ETF predictions for 2025… https://t.co/uDj1OCkaVQ pic.twitter.com/ye3zA2sinV — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) January 11, 2025 Meanwhile, he narrowed the predictions to include specific ETF filings from Grayscale and Bitwise, predicting approvals for both. He predicted that Vanguard would shift its stance and support crypto ETF trading. Donald Trump to Change the Tides President-elect Donald Trump will take office officially on January 20, creating a new era for the industry. Beyond Paul Atkins, Trump also named a Crypto and AI Czar, David Sacks, to help coordinate policies from the White House. As reported by Coingape, one of Sacks’ first tasks is to organize an inaugural crypto ball next week. As predicted by many experts, these trends will help fuel a robust shift in crypto regulation and enforcement. In addition to the Solana and XRP ETF approvals, price boosts are expected for both.

Predictions now indicate a possible surge up to $8. However, instead of the XRP price garnering investors’ interest, analysts have their eyes elsewhere. WallitIQ (WLTQ), a $0.042 altcoin, is stealing the spotlight with its impressive potential to generate 40,000% returns by Q1 2025. Ripple (XRP) May Hit $8 But WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Bring Jaw-dropping 40,000% Gains The XRP price is currently trading around $2.44, with predictions indicating a rise to $8. History shows that the XRP price often rises after new Ripple partnerships. For example, after Ripple Labs announced its partnership with MoneyGram in 2019, the XRP price saw temporary gains. Similarly, the XRP price saw fair hikes after Ripple Labs partnered with banks like Santander and American Express to promote its currency for cross-border payments. In August 2024, Ripple Labs began its partnership with the IMF, a move that is predicted to trigger an XRP price surge this year, perhaps up to $8. However, surges caused by partnerships are often short-lived and less than expectations, and smart analysts know this. Therefore, analysts are bullish on a surer option: a rising altcoin currently priced at $0.0420. This altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ), is not based on fleeting partnerships but on the latest AI technology, a factor that will inevitably trigger rapid adoption and jaw-breaking surges in Q1 2025. Already demonstrating its impressive potential, this altcoin generated over $6 million in the last presale stages as thousands of analysts bought over 350 million tokens. The ongoing presale, which is currently priced at $0.0420 per token, has recently started and has already generated over $200,000 from the sale of 5 million tokens. Analysts predict that this altcoin will effortlessly generate $5 million in monthly revenue by Q1 2025, ultimately dominating the $700 billion crypto wallet and AI market. While the XRP price surge to $8 due to the Ripple partnership is uncertain, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is expected to multiply investments by 40,000% in Q1 2025. Therefore, analysts advise investors to take advantage of this life-changing opportunity by joining the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale immediately. The $0.0420 price will not last for long, as hundreds of investors are joining the presale daily. For investors who want massive gains in Q1 2025, the best time to act is now. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Be The Next Game-Changer In Crypto A major reason why analysts are bullish on WallitIQ (WLTQ) despite the XRP price predictions is that this altcoin presents something more. This rising altcoin will change the scope of crypto trading with improved security and simplicity features. For instance, WallitIQ (WLTQ) uses a double-layered encryption process to protect transactions. It also features Escrow-connect, an AI-powered tool that double-checks external connections before establishing them. Additionally, WallitIQ (WLTQ) supports biometric authentication. Users can secure their accounts with fingerprints or facial recognition, which are more reliable than pins and passwords. This altcoin platform has publicly audited its smart contract with SolidProof , a top-notch and reliable smart contract auditing firm. Far from being complicated due to advanced security, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is very easy to use, even for beginners. It features a user-friendly interface that supports customizable widgets. The platform also contains a variety of educational resources to help investors learn as they trade. Conclusion While the XRP price is poised to hit $8 following the IMF partnership with Ripple Labs, its growth depends on short-term market reactions. Therefore, analysts are counting on WallitIQ (WLTQ), a highly innovative altcoin projected to grow 40,000% in Q1 2025. For any trader who wants to see massive gains in Q1 2025, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is the way to go. Coins are still going out for a token price of $0.0420, but not for long. With hundreds of investors joining daily, this price will skyrocket soon. Before that happens and you miss your chance, join the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale now.

Known for his active presence on social media, Schwartz recently warned about a new scam targeting crypto users. The Coinbase Impersonation Scam In a recent X post, Schwartz alerted the XRP Army about an alarming phishing tactic. Scammers posing as representatives of Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, are attempting to exploit users through fraudulent emails. The emails claim that recipients must review their account details to ensure seamless operations on the platform. Accompanying this, Schwartz shared an image of one such email, highlighting its deceptive design. Adding to the urgency, some community members confirmed receiving similar emails. One investor recounted receiving the email and a follow-up call from a Canadian phone number impersonating Coinbase support. Thankfully, the user remained vigilant and avoided falling victim to the scam. XRP Community Responds with Gratitude Schwartz has long been a guiding figure for the XRP community during his 12 years at Ripple, frequently sharing valuable advice. In a similar incident in 2024, the Ripple CTO revealed that scammers had tried to contact him by text and email. As mentioned above, the bad actors posed as the ‘Asset Shielding Department’ in the exchange. The phishing attempt aimed to deceive Schwartz into sharing his personal information, presumably to gain unauthorized access to his assets or sensitive data. Schwartz’s swift action earned him accolades from the XRP community. Many expressed gratitude for his vigilance, with one user dubbing him a “true community caretaker.” Others echoed the sentiment, appreciating his consistent efforts to safeguard the ecosystem. A Growing Threat of Crypto Scams The rise of digital assets has brought innovation and opportunity, but it has also increased illicit activities like phishing scams. These scams often target unsuspecting users, tricking them into revealing sensitive information or transferring funds. Many users have fallen victim to such schemes, losing access to their accounts and hard-earned assets. Industry leaders and regulatory agencies are taking proactive measures to combat the rise in scams . As seen in Schwartz’s recent tweet, companies like Ripple are educating users about security threats and sharing timely warnings. Exchanges also enhance their security protocols, implement two-factor authentication, and monitor suspicious activity. Regulatory agencies have introduced stricter guidelines to protect users. Governments worldwide are cracking down on fraudulent activities, requiring exchanges to verify user identities and report suspicious transactions. Some agencies have also launched public awareness campaigns to help users recognize and avoid scams.

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-11 21:24:00

As the weekend approaches, Tether has performed exemplary, topping the weekly revenue chart with $122.78 Million in fees for the last seven days. The latest data from DefiLlama shows the revenue performance of different sectors within the crypto ecosystem. The data shows that stablecoin issuers are performing well. This weekly fee revenue data highlights the success of protocols that focus on providing value to users willing to pay for services rather than relying solely on token price speculation. The revenue data indicates a change in crypto trading. Early crypto traders depended on price surges, while current traders relied on earning fees from actual services, including payment processing, lending, trading, and blockchain usage fees. The dominance of Tether in fee generation, followed by Circle ($33.33 Million) and Ethereum ($30.33 Million), shows how critical financial infrastructure commands the highest user payments. Source: DefiLlama Stablecoins are putting up top performance in the blockchain ecosystem Tether’s weekly revenue of $122.78 Million shows how critical stablecoins have become to crypto’s financial system. The fee accumulates from transaction costs as users always transfer USDT across different blockchains. Tether supports 11 networks, including Ethereum, Tron, and Solana. Circle appeared second among stablecoin issuers, after generating revenue worth $33.33 Million in weekly fees. The pattern gives a clear indication that the need for digital dollars in crypto payments has gone up. Layer-1 blockchains have not been left far behind in fee generation. Solana raised a $35.06 million weekly fee, outperforming Ethereum’s $30.33 million and Tron’s $13.37 Million. The fees show that the Solana network attracts more transactions due to more active users. Liquid staking is also generating a lot of revenue. Jito appears at the top with $43.42 Million earned in weekly fees, with Lido generating $20.78 Million across several chains. There is an increase in demand for staking services that give users a way to earn yield without interfering with liquidity. DeFi protocols are keeping up as their performance is promising Most DeFi revenue comes from decentralized exchanges, with Raydium earning $43.36 Million in weekly fees. Uniswap, which is running in more than 22 chains, earned $31.97 Million in weekly fees. Lending platforms like Aave managed $15.32 Million, way below Raydium and Uniswap, which shows that the current market supports trading more than lending. Uniswap has a straightforward revenue model; its fee comes from traders paying to swap tokens. The lending sector, under the DeFi protocol, drives a narrative of a market condition.

Expert Breaks Down The Potential Path",https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/7000-ethereum-in-sight-expert-breaks-down-the-potential-path/,"There is a reason for Ethereum fans to be optimistic, as expert analysis suggests that the cryptocurrency is going to touch the skies in the coming months. As Bitcoin has just crossed $94,000, Ethereum also shows signs of life and bounces back from its recent low and hints at the possibility of price explosion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Remains Below $95k: Analyst Says It’s a Golden Time to Accumulate—Here’s Why A Quick Look At The Patterns Well-known crypto analyst Ali Martinez has found a bullish reversal pattern that can potentially take the price of Ethereum into much higher value. Trading at $3,281 at the moment, Ethereum has slipped below the middle line of its rising channel and has traders spooked. But Martinez is one who thinks if Ethereum could just retest the lower boundary at $2,800 and rebound, it will likely launch into a bullish trend. This rebound may eventually set the stage for Ethereum to reach between $6,000 and $7,000. If #Ethereum $ETH is following an ascending parallel channel, a dip to the lower boundary at $2,800 could act as a launchpad for a move toward $6,000. pic.twitter.com/uYP6BW3DZh — Ali (@ali_charts) January 10, 2025 Market Sentiment & Challenges Even though these are all good signs, the mood in the futures market right now is not clear. Open interest in Ethereum has gone down by 1.25%, which shows that some buyers are becoming more cautious. The long-to-short number is still less than 1, which means that traders are betting against Ethereum instead of for it. Also, funding rates have gone down a lot, which shows that people are less interested in taking leveraged long bets. Although short-term sentiment may be negative, long-term holders may see attractive entry points at current prices. Due to their inherent volatility, cryptocurrencies require constant vigilance and awareness of market trends. Key Resistance Levels All eyes will be on Ethereum’s performance and whether it can overcome important resistance thresholds as we advance into 2025. Several elements determine whether one may achieve $6,000 or even $7,000: market conditions, investor mood, and more general economic impact. At the time of writing, Ether was trading at $3,274, down 0.9% and 9.9% in the daily and weekly timeframes, data from Coingecko shows. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Bounce Back?

Ether is expected to rise by a solid 93% in six months and 94% in three months, according to predictions by CoinCheckup.

So why are so many investors moving over to Rollblock (RBLK), and how will Ethereum fare in the next quarter?

Ethereum has also now brought proto-danksharding onto the Ethereum (ETH) network which has gone a long way to reducing gas fees.

What started as a joke or a mere fad has turned into a legitimate investment avenue, attracting both seasoned investors and curious newcomers. In a world where traditional markets are often volatile, meme coins have emerged as a refreshing alternative, creating unique opportunities for short-term gains. This trend has drawn in a wave of enthusiastic investors eager to cash in on the latest buzz, and trust me, it’s a wild ride. Over the years, meme coins have captured the hearts (and wallets) of millions. From Dogecoin’s meteoric rise to Shiba Inu’s massive community, these playful tokens have shown they can pack a punch in the market. But now, we’re entering a new era with exciting contenders like BTFD Coin that promise to elevate the meme coin phenomenon to dizzying new heights. With features like a play-to-earn game, a lucrative referral program, staking rewards, and a strong community backing, BTFD Coin is not just another meme coin—it’s a game-changer. BTFD Coin is making waves in the presale arena, raising over $5.1 million in just its first month, and it’s not slowing down. As we dive deeper into this article, we’ll explore why BTFD Coin stands out among the best new meme coins to invest in for the short term, comparing it with established names like Brett and Cheems. So, buckle up; we’re about to delve into the nitty-gritty of these exciting projects and see what sets them apart. BTFD Coin: The New Contender in Meme Coins BTFD Coin is the latest player in the meme coin game, and it’s already making headlines. Currently in its 13th presale stage, with a price of just $0.000142, this coin has already sold over 63 billion tokens and amassed a remarkable tally of over 8,000 holders. But what’s really turning heads is its phenomenal presale performance, having raised over $5.1 million in such a short time. Investors are buzzing, and many are already eyeing it as one of the best new meme coins to invest in for the short term. The hype around BTFD Coin isn’t just about numbers—it’s about potential. Analysts are predicting that, with the right momentum, the price could reach $0.0006 by the end of the presale. Let’s break that down. If an investor puts in $35,000 at the current price, they’d snag an impressive 246,478,874 $BTFD Coins. When the price hits $0.0006, that investment could balloon to a staggering $148,000. That’s the kind of short-term gain that gets folks talking! But what’s more exciting is the community aspect of BTFD Coin. This isn’t just a token; it’s about building connections among holders. The referral program incentivises users to bring in new investors, creating a buzz that can drive the price even higher. Plus, the staking rewards mean that those who hold onto their coins can earn while they wait for the price to rise. As the community grows, so does the potential for profits, making BTFD Coin one of the best new meme coins to invest in for the short term. Brett: A Steady Player in the Meme Coin Space Now, let’s talk about Brett. This meme coin may not have the explosive growth of BTFD Coin, but it’s been a steady player in the meme coin market. Brett has built a loyal following, and investors appreciate its stability compared to the often chaotic nature of meme coins. But in a market that thrives on excitement and potential, does Brett still hold its ground as one of the best new meme coins to invest in for the short term? One of the things that set Brett apart is its consistent community engagement. The developers have worked hard to keep the community informed and involved, which has fostered a sense of loyalty among holders. Plus, with its recent updates and enhancements, Brett is showing it’s not just sitting on its laurels. Yet, while it has its strengths, the question remains whether it can compete with the fresh energy that BTFD Coin brings to the table. While Brett has its advantages, the current market sentiment seems to favour new entrants that promise quicker returns. Investors looking for fast profits may be swayed to BTFD Coin, especially given its impressive presale results. However, Brett’s reliability might appeal to those who prefer a more measured approach. In a nutshell, while Brett has its merits, it’s essential to weigh its stability against the potential gains offered by BTFD Coin. Both may have a place in a diversified portfolio, but right now, the spotlight is firmly on BTFD. Cheems: The Meme King Still in the Game Ah, Cheems—the beloved meme coin that has garnered a cult following. It’s been a fan favourite for a while now, but the question is: can it keep up with the new kids on the block like BTFD Coin? Cheems has proven to be a resilient player in the meme coin arena, but its ability to compete for the title of the best new meme coins to invest in for the short term is under scrutiny. Cheems has established a strong community, and its playful branding has certainly helped it capture the hearts of many. However, the meme coin market is ever-evolving, and the excitement surrounding new projects like BTFD Coin is hard to ignore. While Cheems has its strengths, it’s possible that the novelty of newer coins could overshadow its longstanding reputation. Investors looking for a quick turnaround may find Cheems a bit too slow for their liking. With BTFD Coin’s impressive presale performance and dynamic features, it’s no wonder many are flocking to the latter. That said, Cheems still has a loyal base that appreciates its consistency. The challenge lies in whether it can innovate and adapt to the changing landscape of meme coins. In conclusion, while Cheems has remained a solid player in the meme coin market, the recent buzz around BTFD Coin could shift the attention and investment away from it. For those seeking the best new meme coins to invest in for the short term, the choice may lean more towards BTFD, especially with its community-driven features and impressive presale figures. Conclusion: The Future Belongs to the Bold Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that BTFD Coin is shaking things up in the meme coin space. Its impressive presale performance, innovative features, and strong community engagement make it a standout contender among the best new meme coins to invest in for the short term. While Brett and Cheems have their strengths, they may not be able to keep pace with the excitement and potential that BTFD Coin offers. Investors looking for a quick return should seriously consider joining the BTFD Coin presale now. With its potential to explode in value and a community that’s passionate and active, BTFD Coin is paving the way for the future of meme coins.

Recent analysis and sentiment metrics suggest the asset may be on track for a continuation of its bullish trajectory, potentially reaching new all-time highs. Cointelegraph recently highlighted XRP’s price behavior, stating it is preparing for a “powerful move” above the $2.9 mark. This comes as optimism grows within the XRP community, with both technical and on-chain indicators aligning to reinforce a positive outlook. LATEST: $XRP price preps for ‘powerful move' above $2.90 as sentiment metrics signal optimism, suggesting that it’s gearing up for a run to new all-time highs. pic.twitter.com/bstTXx3Uib — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) January 10, 2025 Key Technical Levels Analyzing the digital asset’s 4-hour chart, several critical levels and zones emerge. At the time of Cointelegraph’s analysis, XRP traded at $2.3168, with a recent bounce off the support area of $2.1558 that sent it as high as $2.5. This support zone corresponds to an order block, a region of prior accumulation, that has historically served as a launchpad for upward momentum. Cointelegraph also highlighted a fair value gap (FVG) near the $2.1558–$2.2 range, indicating inefficiencies in price movement that may attract bullish interest. The market may revisit this area before a sustained rally takes place, as liquidity and support converge here. On the resistance side, the daily chart shows a key resistance zone around $2.5. Breaking through this range would likely signal a continuation of XRP’s broader uptrend, potentially pushing it above $2.9. Beyond this, the psychological $3 level could be a magnet for price action, supported by both technical setups and increasing market confidence. If XRP can sustain its momentum, it could reach a new all-time high in no time. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Sentiment and Market Factors The sentiment surrounding XRP remains positive, bolstered by its spectacular performance in late 2024, and its resilience in early 2025. The digital asset has stayed above $2 level for weeks now, and with the positive signs on its chart, it could soon turn the $3 level to support, and potentially target its all-time high of $3.84. At press time, XRP had risen to $2.32 slightly higher than its price at the time of Cointelegraph’s analysis. Other factors could also contribute to XRP’s momentum as it targets the $2.9 threshold. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently met with President-elect Donald Trump and described this meeting as a strong start to 2025 . This meeting and Trump’s upcoming return to office and the resignation of Gary Gensler, current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have set the stage for a massive bullish resurgence.

SUI’s price has recently reached a new high of $5.35, a 20% increase in just 10 days, driven by solid technical signals and increased acceptance. Conversely, Litecoin’s future value is uncertain as it strives to recover from a 40% decline from its December high of $147.22. In this environment, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out with its advanced GHOSTDAG technology and the aggressive LAUNCH300 campaign, which gives a 300% boost on BDAG purchases. Having raised over $179 million, and with analysts expecting its price to hit $1 by 2025, the Layer-1 project is drawing significant attention from large-scale participants and developers. This piece explores the recent developments and future prospects of these promising projects. The Latest 300% Bonus Boosting BDAG Toward $1 BlockDAG Network has been making significant strides in marketing since its inception, quickly securing over 170,000 participants. This Layer 1 project has been prominent for over a year, gaining additional traction as it nears its mainnet launch. A key highlight of BlockDAG’s initiatives is the LAUNCH300 campaign, offering a hefty 300% bonus on BDAG acquisitions. Seen as a potential Kaspa competitor, the project is surrounded by optimistic forecasts, with some analysts predicting it could reach $1 by 2025. BlockDAG continually exceeds expectations on many levels. Its swift transaction capability of 10 blocks per second has attracted both crypto specialists and large-scale participants, while rapid advancements toward mainnet launch have spurred a successful presale, amassing over $179 million worldwide. With plans for establishing a Swiss foundation, allocating grants, and maintaining an active low-code/no-code platform, BlockDAG’s path forward appears robust. With BDAG priced at $0.0248 during the presale, and large-scale participants leveraging the LAUNCH300 code, many view this as an excellent opportunity for long-term engagement. Litecoin’s Price Fluctuations: Can LTC Climb to $184 or Dip Further? Litecoin’s future price trajectory is unpredictable as it currently trades below the crucial $110 resistance mark. Despite an impressive 120% surge in late 2024, Litecoin has struggled to keep up the pace, falling 40% from its December high of $147.22. Nevertheless, LTC has managed to uphold its descending resistance trend line as support twice, signaling a possible upturn. With RSI and MACD showing neutral readings, there are no definitive signs of a bullish breakout or a continued downfall. The wave analysis hints that Litecoin might be embarking on its fifth upward movement, eyeing $184 as per Fibonacci retracement levels. The pivotal $110 level will likely shape its long-term trajectory. Until there’s a significant market move, Litecoin’s future price remains a balanced play of hope and caution. Will SUI Continue to Climb or Retreat? The SUI price has surged remarkably, setting a new record at $5.35, following a rapid 20% increase in just ten days. This surge has eclipsed major altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. Since November 2024, SUI has been charting a bullish path within a rising channel, bolstered by solid technical indicators such as RSI and SMA. Having surpassed a $2 billion Total Value Locked (TVL) with 69.75% of its tokens locked, SUI’s potential remains strong. If the momentum persists, SUI may revisit its peak and target $6.60. Conversely, a downturn could see it approaching critical support near $4.50. SUI continues to draw significant interest due to its robust growth and potential for long-term appreciation. Summing Up the Top Cryptos In 2025, Sui, Litecoin, and BlockDAG each offer distinct prospects within the cryptocurrency space. SUI’s recent peak of $5.35 and its substantial $2 billion TVL underscore its robust expansion potential, possibly pushing toward $6.60. On the other hand, Litecoin faces a cautious path, as it struggles to breach the $110 mark aiming for $184, with essential technical support being crucial. BlockDAG, meanwhile, shines with its advanced GHOSTDAG protocol, rapid transaction capabilities, and the impactful LAUNCH300 campaign, which has helped gather $179 million in crypto presale . For those looking to diversify, the upward trajectory of Sui, the potential recovery of Litecoin, and the pioneering technology of BlockDAG present strong cases for consideration.

According to the local press, the man has been forced to move his family from one Airbnb to the next because the police are apparently unable to guarantee their safety. Criminals Intended to Torture Victim Speaking about the attempted kidnapping, the father of four told the Quebec newspaper La Presse that his would-be abductors had been prepared to mete out violence on him and his children to achieve their goal. He said they had torture equipment and probably intended to cut one of his limbs using a two-foot by two-foot tarpaulin with a hole in the middle and claws around it. The victim’s ordeal began on November 4, 2024, when two masked men threatened him outside his house, but he managed to lock his door before they could gain entry. On November 8, he claimed to have noticed a black car without a license plate parked near his home, prompting him to contact the police. A few days later, the man said he found himself behind the same strange vehicle on a main road before it suddenly swerved, causing him to pull over. One of the car’s occupants then reportedly pulled a gun on the unidentified individual, forcing him to use pepper spray to defend himself. Following investigations, police arrested four suspects, with two of them appearing in court in November 2024, accused of plotting an abduction and being in possession of illegal firearms. Having no prior criminal records, the alleged assailants were released on bail and confined under house arrest until March 2025, when their trial was scheduled to begin. The move left the crypto enthusiast living in fear, as he suspected his attackers may have links to organized crime, compelling him to find temporary accommodation in different places. According to the police, the culprits targeted the victim, believing he owned 2.5 million BTC after being misled by posts on a Facebook page he had been moderating for the last few years. However, the man claims his Bitcoin holdings may be worth only $10,000 at most. Rising Threats According to Casa co-founder Jameson Lopp, there have been more than 100 physical attacks on BTC holders in the last few years. In October 2024, the crypto security expert launched an archive chronicling several violent encounters digital asset owners had faced, including stabbings in New York City and kidnappings in Lithuania and Turkey. This latest case signals rising crypto-related abductions, especially in Canada. In November last year, Dean Skurka, CEO of prominent crypto firm WonderFi, was reportedly hijacked in Toronto and forced to pay $720,000 to secure his release. In the same month, Montreal police discovered the body of crypto influencer Kevin Mirshahi, who had been kidnapped earlier in the year along with three others. Mirshahi had been accused of promoting a pump-and-dump scheme involving a cryptocurrency called Marsan (MRS), whose value plummeted by more than 90%, causing untold losses to thousands of investors.

In a decisive move, CEO Eric Turner has confirmed the layoff of 15% of the company’s workforce. This shift aims to sharpen focus on what Messari does best: delivering top-tier crypto data and insights. For now, the company has chosen not to announce the changes formally, but the impact is clear. “Streamlining for Growth”: The New Messari Direction The layoffs include full-time employees and contractors whose terms were not renewed. Notably, this is a common step for businesses at the start of a new year. Messari’s decision struggles in the crypto industry, with companies like Kraken, Sky Mavis, and Paxos cutting jobs. Even competitor CoinDesk has weathered multiple layoffs, signaling an industry-wide belt-tightening. For Messari, this is not a retreat; it is a refocus. Founded in 2018, the company has built a reputation for clear analytics, reliable pricing data, and its popular Mainnet conference in New York. These layoffs could signal a pivot toward consolidating its strongest assets. Ryan Selkis Fuels The Messari Legacy of Vision and Controversy Messari was started by Ryan Selkis, a leader known for being influential and controversial. Selkis pushed the company forward with big ideas, but his strong opinions on social media caused problems. In one case, he argued with critics of President-elect Donald Trump and made harsh comments during a political debate. Eventually, Selkis stepped down, saying his outspoken nature had put the company at risk. Turner’s Steady Hand in a Shifting Market Selkis’s departure paved the way for Eric Turner, a calmer and more focused leader, to take charge. Turner’s promotion to CEO marked a turning point. Under his leadership, Messari has shifted its approach. The firm moved from Selkis’ grand vision of hiring 1,000 analysts to a more streamlined, efficiency-driven model. Despite recent challenges, Messari remains a heavyweight in the crypto research space. Backed by financial giants like Point72 Ventures and Galaxy Digital, the company raised $35 million in its series B funding round in 2022 . Turner’s plan focuses on helping Messari’s smaller team deliver great insights while staying competitive. Messari’s restructuring is part of a larger story unfolding across the crypto world. After years of fast growth, companies face tough choices and must plan carefully. For Messari, this could be the fresh start it needs to succeed in a market where survival depends on focus and innovation.

Pepe Rescues Trump (PEPERTRU), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPERTRU is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Rescues Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Rescues Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Rescues Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Rescues Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Rescues Trump by entering its contract address – HtgdKmNDff2UgXmmJYCryKhjVE2F89XMncNt8oThipHz – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPERTRU. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-11 22:50:00

Over the past 24 hours, FTM price has rebounded and has now crossed the $0.7 resistance level per current market data. Drawing on the Sonic hype, this current Fantom rebound might usher in more uptick soon. The Sonic Chain Milestone and Ecosystem Trend According to Sonic Chain’s update, it has reached the $100 million Total Value Locked (TVL) milestone. The protocol recorded this milestone in less than 6 weeks since the Sonic Genesis block went live . $100 Million TVL. pic.twitter.com/UKICYqrv0k — Sonic Labs (@SonicLabs) January 11, 2025 While this milestone is significant, it is not the first for the protocol. Per an earlier update from Coingape, Sonic Chain breached the 1 million block milestone about 3 weeks after it launched. The total value locked is a metric that depicts the cumulative amount of capital resident on the blockchain. Since its inception, Sonic Labs, the previous Fantom, has released some Decentralized Applications (DApps) on the protocol. An Ethereum bridge went live in late December 2024 to chart a strong foundation for the network. Implication for Fantom Price While the Sonic Chain has its native token, S, most of the advances within its ecosystem impact Fantom’s price the most. When writing, the coin changed hands for $0.7206, up by 2.82% in the past 24 hours. Amid the drawdown of the past week, the price of FTM jumped from a low of $0.6929 to a high of $0.7296 before resting at its current level. Fantom had a rocky year in 2024, with a combined growth of 71%. This 52-week growth rate pales compared to its core rivals like Solana (SOL), which has jumped 90%. Meanwhile, Sonic Labs seeks to change the future for Fantom through the new chain. With better speed, connectivity, and a robust ecosystem, the expectation is that FTM may breach the $1 mark in the short term. The Altcoin Season Advantage Amid the push for relevance in the broader blockchain ecosystem, Sonic Chain and Fantom may benefit from the price surge the expected altcoin season might usher in soon. In a recent update, Santiment data shows HODLer count growth for Ethereum , Dogecoin, and other top altcoins. This metric shows a broader market confidence for these chains, a trend that may impact Fantom if it persists. In addition, the incoming Donald Trump administration is poised to benefit altcoins, considering the President-elect’s family is pro-DeFi.

Sui’s impressive all-time high of $5.36 and Sei’s steady price gains are grabbing attention. However, Web3Bay is emerging as the real game-changer in blockchain-based commerce. Known as the “Amazon of Web3,” Web3Bay delivers lower fees, full transparency, and direct buyer-seller rewards. Unlike traditional marketplaces, it cuts out middlemen to create a fairer system. Its presale is a chance to get in early on what many see as a promising project. For those exploring cryptos with real-world utility, Web3Bay could lead the next wave of decentralized e-commerce. Web3Bay: A New Era for Blockchain Commerce Web3Bay is rapidly becoming a leader in decentralized commerce, often called the “Amazon of Web3.” By combining blockchain’s strengths with the simplicity of an online marketplace, it delivers exactly what buyers and sellers need—lower fees, better transparency, and direct rewards. Unlike Amazon, Web3Bay removes middlemen, creating a peer-to-peer system where users get the full benefits without additional costs. This unique approach makes it one of the underrated cryptos to watch now. The ongoing presale is gathering pace, allowing early adopters to purchase 3BAY tokens at $0.0039675 during stage three. The presale has already raised over $580,000, with each stage seeing a 15% price increase. Early participants could achieve a return on investment (ROI) of over 6,430%, mirroring the early days of Amazon when those who believed in its potential reaped major rewards. What sets Web3Bay apart from others is its user-focused system. Sellers earn better margins, buyers gain rewards, and blockchain ensures total transparency in transactions. The platform is building for the future, with plans to introduce staking and cross-chain compatibility to increase flexibility. For anyone exploring underrated cryptos with real-world applications, Web3Bay could be the game-changer of 2025, poised to revolutionize decentralized e-commerce. Sui Hits New All-Time High of $5.36 – What’s Driving the Surge? Sui recently reached a new milestone, with its Sui all-time high hitting $5.36. As a Layer 1 blockchain known for its low-latency, high-speed transactions, Sui has quickly become a favorite for DeFi applications. Its unique parallel transaction model allows developers to build fast, scalable dApps, making it a strong contender in the blockchain industry. The network’s TVL has crossed $1.85 billion, reflecting growing trust from the community. Partnerships, such as with Franklin Templeton Digital Assets, and the upcoming AI integrations are adding further momentum. Despite minor setbacks like the November 2024 network outage, Sui remains a solid choice for blockchain enthusiasts. Sei Price Holding Strong – What’s Supporting Its Stability? The Sei price remains steady at $0.38874, continuing to show resilience in the ever-changing crypto market. Sei’s blockchain, designed for decentralized exchanges (DEXs), has carved out a niche by offering ultra-fast transaction times of just 380 milliseconds. Recent developments are fueling Sei’s stability, including the planned Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, set for release in 2024. This upgrade will make it easier for developers to bring their smart contracts to Sei, attracting a wider range of users. As the ecosystem grows with platforms like DragonSwap and Pallet Exchange, Sei’s long-term potential remains strong. Final Takeaway: Why Consider Web3Bay? With Sui’s all-time high reaching $5.36 and the Sei price holding firm at $0.38874, both blockchains show strong promise in their respective areas. Sui’s focus on scalable DeFi solutions and Sei’s ultra-fast DEX capabilities make them popular picks. However, Web3Bay stands out by bringing blockchain into everyday use through decentralized commerce. Dubbed the “ Amazon of Web3 ,” Web3Bay’s presale offers early adopters the chance to secure 3BAY tokens before they rise in price. With its practical marketplace features and a focus on user rewards, Web3Bay has the potential to reshape online retail for good. As more crypto enthusiasts take notice, it could prove to be one of the most promising opportunities of 2025.

The altcoin leader’s decline comes amid heightened market volatility and uncertainty, with many investors reevaluating their positions following the recent selloff. However, despite the downturn, on-chain data suggests that underlying investor sentiment remains robust. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Major Deleveraging – Analyst Explains Price Crash Below $100K According to data from IntoTheBlock, Ethereum saw significant outflows from exchanges this week, with net outflows surpassing $1.4 billion—the highest level since November. Such activity often signals strong accumulation trends as investors move their holdings off exchanges and into cold storage or other wallets, indicative of long-term confidence in the asset. These substantial outflows underscore Ethereum’s resilience even amid challenging price action. Analysts are closely monitoring whether these accumulation trends can offset the bearish momentum and spark a recovery in the coming weeks. With Ethereum trading near critical support levels, the next moves will be pivotal in determining the direction of its price in 2025. As bullish seasonality for altcoins often kicks in during post-halving years, many believe that Ethereum could soon reclaim its upward trajectory, contingent on both market conditions and broader macroeconomic factors. Ethereum Prepares For Rebound Ethereum has shown signs of recovery after its recent drop, now attempting to break above the $3,300 level. The altcoin leader has faced considerable challenges, with a 15% decline from its recent highs putting pressure on bullish sentiment. However, key on-chain metrics indicate that Ethereum’s fundamentals remain strong, pointing toward potential growth in the coming months. Data from IntoTheBlock, shared on X, highlights a significant development: this week saw net $ETH outflows from exchanges exceeding $1.4 billion, the highest level since November. Such substantial outflows often signal that investors are moving their holdings off exchanges, a behavior typically associated with accumulation. This trend suggests that, despite recent bearish price action, confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential remains intact. While Ethereum’s recent price action may appear underwhelming to some, these accumulation trends provide a bullish underpinning for the asset. Historically, large exchange outflows have preceded significant price rallies, as reduced sell-side liquidity can drive upward momentum when demand increases.

As Ethereum works to reclaim higher levels, breaking above $3,300 could signal the beginning of a more sustained recovery. With strong fundamentals and growing investor confidence, Ethereum appears well-positioned for a potentially bullish 2025. However, the asset must navigate current market volatility to confirm its uptrend. Testing Weekly Demand Ethereum is trading at $3,250, reflecting ongoing struggles to break above the $3,300 resistance level. The price action remains tentative as ETH tests critical weekly demand levels. This area has historically provided strong support, and if Ethereum manages to close above the $3,100 mark, it could pave the way for a meaningful rebound in the coming days. The current consolidation phase highlights a market looking for direction. For bulls to regain control, Ethereum must break above key resistance levels. Reclaiming the $3,750 mark is crucial to confirm a bullish breakout and signal a potential uptrend. Such a move would not only restore investor confidence but also position ETH to retest higher levels as market sentiment shifts. However, failure to hold the $3,100 demand zone could lead to further downside pressure, with lower support levels likely to be tested. The coming sessions will be pivotal as Ethereum navigates these key levels. Related Reading: Key Metrics Reveal Bitcoin STH Support Levels Around $89K–$86K – Is BTC At Risk? With the broader market sentiment in flux, ETH’s ability to stay above its critical support zones will determine whether a bullish trend emerges or a prolonged consolidation phase persists.

This development coincided with the 16th anniversary of Bitcoin’s first-ever mention on Twitter, a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency history. Blockchain trackers have identified a series of large transactions involving unknown wallets and major exchanges, raising questions about the motive behind these significant transfers. $903 Million in Bitcoin Moves Across Wallets and Exchanges According to the data from the blockchain analytics service Whale Alert , there have been 10 large Bitcoin transactions in the last 24 hours with the total transaction amount of about 903 million BTC. The transfers primarily involved changing between addresses of unknown entities and cryptocurrency exchanges like Kraken, Binance and Robinhood. Among the largest ones, there were 620 BTC for $58.4 million, 888 BTC for $83.8 million, and 1,027 BTC for $96.7 million sent from Kraken to various unknown wallets. Also, 1,164 BTC or $109,700,000 was transferred between the wallets with unknown owners, and Robinhood sent 600 BTC or $56,800,000 to another unknown wallet. There was also much action on Binance as 999 BTC valued at $93.6 million was transferred from an unknown wallet. The same pattern continued with 1,881 BTC worth $176.5 million being sent to Kraken from other anonymous wallets. These movements have raised questions into whether the activity is related to sales, purchases or over the counter transactions. Potential Reasons Behind Bitcoin Transfers The cause of such a significant volatility of BTC price remains unknown, but there are several hypotheses. Transfers to exchanges like Kraken and Binance are usually a signal of the sellers while withdrawals to unidentified addresses could be a signal of accumulation. OTC trading can also be another possible reason because it enables buyers and sellers to transact large volumes of crypto without necessarily affecting the general market. Due to the fact that some of the wallets can be anonymous, it is difficult to establish the exact final intent for these transactions. Others have suggested that this could be due to some form of market positioning or potential future market event or institutional reallocation of assets. Nevertheless, without more information, the motives for these transfers are uncertain. BTC Marks 16th Anniversary of $0 Value Tweet The timing of these transactions coincides with Bitcoin’s 16th anniversary of its first-ever public mention. On January 11, 2009, Hal Finney, one of Bitcoin’s earliest supporters, tweeted, “Running Bitcoin.” This marked the cryptocurrency’s debut on social media and has since become a historic milestone in its journey from obscurity to global recognition. At the time, Bitcoin price was at $0, as adoption and utility were still in their infancy. Since then, Bitcoin’s price has risen dramatically, currently trading at $94,306. Although it remains far from Hal Finney’s long-term prediction of $10 million per coin, its progress continues to inspire confidence among investors. Bitcoin Price Rally Looming? At present, Bitcoin’s price is trading slightly below its recent all-time high (ATH) of $108,268, reached in December 2024. Despite this, analysts believe that the market remains in a bullish phase. On-chain data from Glassnode indicates that Bitcoin’s long-term holders are still in profit, with no significant loss-making among this group. As Bitcoin remains just over $94,000, some traders anticipate further price volatility in the near term. A correction to around $91,000 has been suggested as part of an Elliott Wave price analysis, but some forecasts predict that Bitcoin could reach as high as $210,000 before mid-February 2025.

Shiba Inu Bullish & INJ Resilient,https://thecoinrise.com/protect-your-shopping-experience-with-web3bay-580k-raised-in-presale-shiba-inu-bullish-inj-resilient/,"In the digital currency market, both well-established coins and emerging projects are marking their presence. The Shiba Inu market trend showcases a robust 14% increase in its value, pushing its market cap to $14 billion, although it faces potential hurdles from rising selling pressures. Similarly, Injective’s (INJ) performance is on the upswing with a 16% increase, spurred by a deflationary policy and the buoyant mood around Bitcoin’s growth. Amidst these financial waves, Web3 in e-commerce is carving out a niche as Web3Bay (3BAY) tackles increasing concerns about data privacy. In its third presale stage, having amassed over $580,000, Web3Bay fuses blockchain technology with e-commerce, crafting a decentralized marketplace that underscores security, transparency, and worldwide user accessibility. Shiba Inu Market Trend: A Look at Its Speculative Surge The Shiba Inu market trend has been in the spotlight recently due to a 14% rise in value over the past week, boosting its market cap to $14 billion. This upturn highlights a moderately bullish phase, with the RSI at 60.8, hinting at potential room for further growth. However, with decreasing ADX values and growing sell-offs, this upward trend might meet resistance. Analysts are eyeing a potential golden cross which could thrust Shiba Inu towards pivotal resistance levels at $0.0000298. Alternatively, an increase in bearish sentiments could guide the Shiba Inu market trend towards a consolidation phase, where crucial support levels at $0.000022 or $0.0000185 will be key in determining its next movements. INJ’s Performance: Deflationary Tactics & BTC’s Ascent Injective’s performance is commendable, with a 16% surge reinforced by strategic enhancements in its ecosystem and enthusiasm over Bitcoin’s potential rise to $100,000. INJ’s price escalated to $26.33, paired with a substantial 127.27% increase in trading volume, highlighting heightened market activity and growing investor interest. Central to this surge is Injective’s proposed 3.0 governance model, designed to amplify its deflationary mechanism through streamlined token burns and staking incentives, reducing overall supply. This strategy aims to reinforce INJ’s value in the crypto market as it strives to regain its peak of $52.75. Web3Bay: Pioneering a Secure Path in E-commerce The 2023 MOVEit data breach shed light on the critical vulnerabilities within centralized e-commerce platforms, sparking a demand for more secure and transparent shopping alternatives. Traditional online shopping platforms not only lack in protecting user data but also impose heavy fees, which can stifle small business growth. Web3Bay (3BAY) is addressing these critical issues by merging blockchain technology with e-commerce, ensuring a secure and reliable space for users to conduct transactions online. Now in its third presale stage, the 3BAY token is available at just $0.0039675. So far, the presale has successfully raised over $580,000 and seen more than 160 million tokens purchased. With projections pointing to a price of $0.1959 at launch, early investors could see an impressive 6430% return on investment. By leveraging web3 in e-commerce , Web3Bay eliminates middlemen, offering worldwide access, faster transactions, and enhanced security for personal data. It’s a platform that not only prioritizes transparency but also reaches out to the underbanked, ensuring an inclusive shopping experience. Both traders and consumers are drawn to Web3Bay’s revolutionary model, which promises to reshape online marketplaces and offers significant potential returns for its early backers. With ongoing reports of data breaches, Web3Bay is increasingly recognized as a dependable option for secure and efficient online shopping. Embrace the Future of E-commerce with Web3Bay While the Shiba Inu market trend and Injective’s performance garner attention, Web3Bay is making significant strides in redefining e-commerce through blockchain. Shiba Inu’s notable rise reflects its growing appeal, and Injective continues to impress with its substantial gains, fueled by deflationary policies and Bitcoin’s momentum. Simultaneously, Web3Bay is tackling critical issues such as data privacy and secure online transactions head-on. With significant funding and an impressive number of 3BAY tokens sold, Web3Bay is establishing new benchmarks for Web3 in e-commerce. At the current presale price, investors have the opportunity to partake in what could be a transformative force in the fusion of cryptocurrency and online commerce.

In contrast, Litecoin’s future value remains uncertain as it struggles to recover from a 40% decline from its December high of $147.22. Amid these developments, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making significant strides with its modern GHOSTDAG technology and the aggressive LAUNCH300 campaign, which provides a 300% bonus on BDAG purchases.

BlockDAG Projects for $1 as LAUNCH300 Offers Goes Viral! BlockDAG Network (BDAG) has been vigorously marketing since its debut, quickly amassing over 170,000 holders in a few months. The Layer 1 project has remained in the limelight, gaining momentum as it nears its mainnet launch. A key highlight is the LAUNCH300 campaign, providing a significant 300% bonus on BDAG purchases. Often referred to as a Kaspa Killer, the initiative is prompting optimistic price forecasts, with some analysts suggesting it might reach $1 by 2025. BlockDAG continues to exceed expectations in various areas. Its rapid transaction capability of 10 blocks per second has attracted crypto experts and enthusiasts, and swift advancements toward mainnet development have supported a prosperous presale, accumulating over $179 million worldwide. With plans for establishing a Swiss foundation, allocating grants, and enhancing a low-code/no-code platform, BlockDAG’s path forward looks bright. With BDAG priced at $0.0248 during the presale, and enthusiasts eagerly utilizing the LAUNCH300 code, the project is seen as a promising long-term prospect. Will LTC Climb to $184 or Decline Further? The future price of Litecoin is currently uncertain as it trades below the crucial $110 resistance level. Following a significant 120% rally in late 2024, Litecoin faced challenges in sustaining its growth, with a 40% drop from its December high of $147.22. Despite these setbacks, LTC has consistently found support at its descending resistance trend line, hinting at a possible recovery. Neutral readings from technical indicators such as the RSI and MACD show no definitive signs of a bullish surge or continued downfall. The wave analysis indicates that Litecoin could be approaching its fifth upward wave, aiming for $184 based on Fibonacci retracement levels. However, the movement around the $110 mark will be crucial in defining its long-term trajectory. Until a definitive trend is established, predictions for Litecoin’s price will continue to balance cautious optimism with prevailing uncertainty. SUI’s Record High: Will It Reach $6.60? SUI’s price trajectory has been remarkable, reaching a new all-time high of $5.35, marking a 20% increase in just ten days and surpassing major altcoins such as Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. SUI has been trading within a bullish channel pattern since November 2024, supported by strong technical indicators like the RSI and SMA. The project has now exceeded $2 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL), with 69.75% of its supply locked, suggesting it is still undervalued. If the current bullish trend persists, SUI might challenge its recent high again and target a new milestone at $6.60. Conversely, a downward turn could see its price drop to significant support levels near $4.50. SUI continues to be a strong candidate for long-term growth, drawing sustained interest with its robust performance. Final Say As we look towards 2025, Sui, Litecoin, and BlockDAG each offer distinct prospects in the crypto market. SUI’s recent all-time high of $5.35 and its impressive $2 billion TVL underscore its potential to climb towards $6.60. Meanwhile, Litecoin’s prospects remain mixed as it strives to overcome the $110 resistance and aim for $184, underpinned by crucial technical support. On the other hand, BlockDAG is rapidly emerging with its cutting-edge GHOSTDAG protocol and swift transaction capabilities, enhanced by the LAUNCH300 campaign’s success, which has led to a $179 million crypto presale achievement. For those looking to diversify their holdings, the upward trends of Sui, the potential recovery of Litecoin, and the pioneering technology of BlockDAG present compelling opportunities.

This in-depth guide will help users evaluate the benefits of each wallet, making it easier for users to choose the top crypto wallet for securing assets and grabbing profitable opportunities in the year ahead. 1. Plus Wallet: Maximize Gains and Minimize Effort Plus Wallet has secured its place among the top 4 crypto wallets today with its efficiency, security, and earning opportunities. One standout feature is its quick 15-minute token listings, where new tokens are live on the platform within just 15 minutes. This allows traders to engage with fresh options and seize potential opportunities as soon as they launch. In addition, Plus Wallet offers a unique Swap to Earn feature where users earn rewards for every single trade they make.

All of this is supported by strong security, a user-friendly interface, and advanced tools designed to streamline users’ trading experience. This combination of speed, security, and gains makes Plus Wallet the best among the top 4 crypto wallets for 2025. 2. Binance Web3: The Trusted Crypto Wallet Binance Web3 Wallet offers strong support for multiple cryptocurrencies, allowing users to manage different assets in one place. It's known for security features and includes SegWit and Bech32 address options, adding flexibility. The wallet also has built-in exchange functionality, allowing users to easily swap assets. As part of Binance, one of the most trusted names in crypto, it provides an added layer of reliability. However, it may not be the best choice for beginners due to its complexity, and customer support could be improved. Additionally, users who prioritize complete decentralization might prefer alternatives, given its connection to a centralized exchange. 3. Uniswap Wallet: Easy Ethereum Swaps Uniswap Wallet, available as a mobile app and Chrome extension, provides a straightforward user experience with a built-in swap function that mirrors the Uniswap web interface. This feature allows users to easily swap tokens within the wallet without a learning curve. The wallet also includes a “Buy” function, enabling users to purchase popular cryptocurrencies using various payment methods, through third-party processors with associated fees. Mobile app users can connect to any DApp through browsers without needing additional extensions. However, Uniswap Wallet is limited to Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens, which may restrict its use for other blockchain assets. 4. SafePal: The Reliable Cold and Hot Wallet Option SafePal is a multi-platform wallet offering robust security features, including an app, a browser extension, and a cold wallet option. It supports cross-chain swaps and spot trading, allowing users to buy crypto with credit or debit cards. The wallet is compatible with thousands of coins and tokens and includes NFT storage. However, some users have raised concerns about the security of the S1 hardware wallet, especially considering its price of $49.99. While the wallet offers value, it's essential to weigh the price against potential security risks for those considering its use. Find Your Best Fit Among the Top 4 Crypto Wallets Each of these wallets offers distinct benefits, making them the top four crypto wallets for 2025. SafePal Wallet is ideal for users looking for a versatile option, offering both hardware and software solutions. However, there have been some complaints about the hardware model in the past. Uniswap Wallet is a great pick for those holding Ethereum-based assets, offering a versatile platform tailored to this ecosystem. Binance Web3 Wallet stands out for its advanced security features, ensuring asset protection for users. Finally, Plus Wallet earns its spot as number one among the top 4 wallets for 2025 , thanks to its rapid token listings, strong security, and unlimited rewards—all available through a simple and intuitive mobile app. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

PropiChain and SUI tokens are suitable alternatives traders are looking up to due to their unique AI integration. Experts further state that PCHAIN has the potential to deliver 30,000x in the coming weeks due to its RWA impact. Below we will discuss the XRP price action resistance and why SUI and PropiChain serve as an alternative to investors. Why traders are considering PropiChain and SUI as the XRP Price alternatives After an incredible rally late last year, the XRP price has failed to go above $2.5 for some days now. Although it had over 6% growth in the last 7 days, regardless, the XRP price has been hovering around $2.3, and the total market cap dropped by 5% to $133.98B. This has got some traders on the lookout for alternatives. SUI is among the hottest projects at the moment and it keeps trying to gain momentum. The project recently announced its plans to integrate AI to enhance its efficiency and security. SUI’s plan to integrate AI and the recent rally the project had positioned it as a great alternative for traders as the XRP price action loses momentum. Also, experts believe PropiChain , a crypto AI project that aims to revolutionize the real estate sector is a great alternative as the XRP price action keeps facing resistance. This project is a decentralized real estate marketplace that offers solutions to the primitive issues in the sector. This token has been gaining traction and a massive inflow of investors, which is evident from the success of its first presale round, where the project raised more than $1.3 million. The project has now crossed $2 million from presale and it is not slowing down. Investors are taking advantage of the discounted entry price of $0.011 in the second presale round to position for the potential 30,000x ROI. Many tipped this token to dominate the real estate and AI market. CoinMarketCap has listed the project which added to its visibility, and audits from BlockAudit boost traders’ confidence in the project. PropiChain Will Dominate Real Estate With its AI Offerings and Other Features PropiChain’s increasing traction and speedy token presale stages are due to its connection to the multi-trillion industry. With its decentralized marketplace, PCHAIN plans to make real estate better via innovations and this helps it edge SUI. Some of the benefits expected when PropiChain is launched include: Advanced Property Filtering PCHAIN’s artificial intelligence will help investors in real estate with property filtering and recommendations quicker and better. This PropiChain innovation will go beyond basic search criteria and employ advanced filters to improve efficiency and investors. For instance, investors can use prompts like possible growth and expected ROI to search for suitable assets. Asides from filtering, PropiChain AI can recommend properties to investors based on their previous searches. Predictive Market Insights Investors need all the help they can get to make profitable decisions. PropiChain marketplace offers this by using AI to appraise market situations and historical statistics. The vast statistics that will be available on this decentralized platform are far beyond the ones mediators reach in the conventional real estate market. The AI will evaluate market trends, property values, and investment opportunities, and this will enhance the predictions’ accuracy and result in strategic investment decision-making for investors. Accurate Property Valuation Getting accurate coats of assets has been a major concern for real estate investors. Overpricing, underpricing, and additional costs imposed by brokers and agents are common concerns. However, with PCHAIN’s AI, getting the actual cost of the property will be easier. This is because the AI will use the vast available information, both historical and present, to calculate real-time prices. PropiChain ’s AI will also take over most intermediary roles to save costs and stress. This also promotes efficiency in the trillion-dollar marketplace. Fractional Ownership PropiChain aims to make real estate more inclusive by breaking the barriers hindering investors. Since its inception, the industry has been reserved for wealthy investors because not everyone can afford huge entry capital or costly mortgages. However, with the real estate fractional ownership model that PropiChain offers, property acquisition will now be easier for investors. For instance, you can pay as low as $1000 for a portion of assets that is worth $650,000 to $700,000 while other investors contribute the remaining capital. Conclusion With the resistance faced by the XRP price, it is wise for investors to find alternatives. PropiChain comes to mind not only because it aims at improving the trillion-dollar industry but also because of its AI integration, which is the sought-after narrative in the crypto market. PropiChain is currently going for $0.011 at the second presale phase, and this is the lowest entry investors will get because the entry price will increase in the third round, and it will rally from there. An investment of $1000 could potentially yield more than 8 figures profit for investors. The XRP price faces its challenges; however, SUI and PropiChain serve as the beacon of hope for investors and Ripple traders are determined to harness the AI-driven insights of PropiChain for smarter, faster, and more secure real estate transactions.

Hackers are increasingly targeting social media accounts to promote fake tokens Hacking social media accounts to promote fake projects or tokens is common among crypto-criminals. The Litecoin incident is the latest in a series of high-profile X account hacks targeting organizations and individuals to promote fake tokens and phishing schemes. These scams aim to steal funds and sensitive user data, underscoring the need for heightened cybersecurity measures. In October, Andy Ayrey, Truth Terminal’s founder’s X account, was attacked. The hacker used the access to promote a token called “IB” and walked away with $600 million in net profit. During the same month, Restaking protocol, EigenLayer’s X account was hacked to promote a fake airdrop campaign.

These quirky tokens, born from internet culture, have a way of capturing the imagination and wallets of investors. From the early days of Dogecoin to the wild ride of Shiba Inu, these coins have shown that sometimes, the biggest returns come from the most unexpected places. Now, if you think you’ve missed the Bonk party, hold up! BTFD Coin is stepping into the spotlight, and it’s shaping up to be one of the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. With a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, a killer referral program, and staking rewards offering a whopping 90% APY, BTFD Coin is ready to take meme coin popularity to new heights. What sets BTFD Coin apart is not just its meme-worthy branding but the actual utility it brings to the table. Launched in a presale that’s already raised over $5.1 million, BTFD Coin has captured the interest of over 8,100 holders, affectionately known as “Bulls.” The excitement surrounding its features is palpable. With the P2E game going live on January 1, 2025, and staking rewards that promise impressive returns, BTFD Coin is not just riding the wave of meme coin hype; it’s creating its own tidal wave. So, as we dive into this article, let’s explore how BTFD Coin stacks up against Bonk. We’ll break down the latest developments, analyst predictions, and what makes BTFD Coin the standout choice for anyone looking to invest in the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. Buckle up, because we’re about to uncover why this could be one of the smartest moves you make this year. BTFD Coin: The Future of Meme Coins BTFD Coin has exploded onto the scene and is making waves that are hard to ignore. With its presale currently in the 13th stage at a price of $0.000142, the coin has already sold over 63 billion tokens. That’s no small feat! As of January 10, 2025, the presale has brought in a staggering $5.1 million, showing that investors are keen on what BTFD has to offer. But what’s all the fuss about? One of the standout features of BTFD Coin is its Play-to-Earn game , which launched on January 1, 2025. Imagine diving into a game that not only entertains you but also rewards you in crypto. Players can earn while they play, making it a fun way to engage with the community and build wealth simultaneously. Talk about a win-win! And let’s not forget the staking aspect. BTFD Coin offers an incredible 90% APY on staking, which is practically unheard of in this space. If you’re thinking about passive income, this is where you want to be. On December 2, staking went live, and investors have been flocking to get in on the action. The referral program is the cherry on top. Invite your friends, and you can earn rewards together. The more, the merrier, right? Now, think about this: if you invested $20,000 when the presale started at just $0.000004, you’d snag an impressive 5 billion BTFD coins. If the price reaches its predicted listing price of $0.0006 once the presale ends, your investment would balloon to a whopping $3 million. That’s the kind of return that gets your heart racing! With all these features combined, BTFD Coin is shaping up to be one of the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. It’s not just a cute token; it’s a serious investment opportunity that could help you cash in big time. Bonk: The Meme Coin That Started It All Now, let’s take a moment to appreciate Bonk. This meme coin made headlines and captured the hearts of many crypto enthusiasts. Launched as a playful alternative to more serious tokens, Bonk quickly gained a following. It brought a sense of community and fun, making it a staple in the meme coin world. But as the hype surrounding Bonk grows quieter, some are left wondering: is it still a good investment? Bonk’s charm lies in its community-driven approach. It became popular primarily through social media buzz and influencer endorsements. However, the lack of substantial utility compared to new contenders like BTFD Coin is starting to show. Bonk doesn’t have a P2E game or staking rewards that can keep investors engaged in the long run. While it had its moment as a fun meme, it’s becoming clear that it might not hold the same potential as newer coins. Analysts have predicted a plateau for Bonk, suggesting that while it remains a beloved token, it may not have the same explosive growth potential as BTFD. The market is shifting, and the focus is now on coins that offer real engagement and rewards. If you’re sitting on Bonk, it might be time to reassess your investment strategy. Are you holding onto a coin that’s losing momentum, or are you ready to jump into something with a brighter future? In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies, waiting too long can be a costly mistake. The meme coin landscape is evolving, and BTFD Coin is leading the charge. If you’re looking for the top new meme coins to buy for 2025, it’s hard to argue against the potential that BTFD brings to the table. Why BTFD Coin is the Right Choice for 2025 As we wrap things up, the evidence is clear: BTFD Coin is not just another token in the sea of meme coins. Its innovative features, including the P2E game, jaw-dropping 90% APY staking, and a rewarding referral program, position it as a top contender among the new meme coins to buy for 2025. With over $5.1 million raised in its presale and more than 64 billion coins sold, the enthusiasm surrounding BTFD is undeniable. The community vibe is electric, and the potential for growth is massive. Crypto analysts are buzzing about BTFD’s prospects, predicting that it could see significant price increases once it hits the exchanges. If you’re still on the fence about where to invest, consider this your wake-up call. The presale is an opportunity you won’t want to miss. Don’t let this wealth-generation chance slip through your fingers. Make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity with BTFD Coin presale !

Interestingly, this rather exciting development comes shortly after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recommended the East African nation overhaul its current crypto policy and align with global standards. Kenya Takes Aim At Crypto Regulation In an effort to adopt a more inclusive approach toward the crypto industry, the Kenyan government through its National Treasury and Economic Planning Department has called for public consultation on its proposed regulatory structure. This framework centers around two documents, one of which is “ The Draft National Policy On Virtual Assets (VAs) and Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) ” which aims to guide the governance of VAs and VASPs as well ensure a fair and efficient market for all stakeholders among other objectives. The second document is a proposed legislation named the “ The Virtual Asset Service Providers Bill, 2025” which focuses on the designation of regulatory authorities and licensing requirements for VASPs. This bill will also highlight general obligations for VASPs in regards to prevention of money laundering , terrorism financing and proliferation financing. Public consultations on both documents will run till January 24, before which all Kenyans and relevant stakeholders are invited to submit their opinions on the proposed crypto framework. Kenya Set To Reverse Anti-Crypto Stance In 2015, the Kenyan Central Bank issued a warning on the use of cryptocurrencies as they banned its use as a legal tender. However, the digital assets movement has remained strong in the East African nation with about 2.8 million Kenyans being crypto owners. With calls for public consultations on a proposed crypto regulatory structure, the Kenyan government appears ready to embrace the potential of this nascent industry. Commenting on this sudden move to legalize virtual assets, the nation’s Cabinet Secretary for Treasury & Economic Planning, John Mbadi shows the significant change in policy. According to local media The Saturday Standard, Mbadi said: The emergence and growth of Virtual Assets (VAs) and Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) have given rise to innovations in the local and international financial system with dynamic opportunities and challenges. The Cabinet Secretary also recognizes the current woes of the crypto industry including fraud, money laundering etc., but believes that these risks can be contained by an efficient regulatory system. As earlier stated, Kenya’s U-turn on crypto comes shortly after a nudge by the IMF. In a technical assistance report , The United Nations’ financial agency had advised Kenya to step up its crypto regulation through the adoption of a clear legislative framework, and ensure consumer protection through financial literacy among other recommendations. At press time, the crypto market cap is valued at $3.21 trillion following a 0.55% loss in the past day.

This substantial purchase comes amid Dogecoin’s bullish recovery in key metrics, as analysts project a significant push to the upside. Dogecoin Whales Buy 470 Million DOGE Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed on X (formerly Twitter) on January 11 that Dogecoin whales have begun accumulating again. Martinez announced the latest DOGE acquisition by these deep-pocketed investors, highlighting that Whales recently bought over 470 million tokens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Unravels 157-Day Fractal Similar To Last Cycle, Why A Surge To $169,000 Is Possible This substantial DOGE purchase, which occurred in the last 48 hours, is valued at approximately 155 million based on current market prices. Such large-scale whale activity often signals a renewed interest in the cryptocurrency, potentially influencing market sentiment and trends. Martinez shared a chart presenting data related to Dogecoin, focusing on the behavior of whales holding assets spanning from 10 million to 100 million DOGE. The shaded area on the chart highlights the cumulative holdings of these wallets owning millions of DOGE. Around late December 2024, Dogecoin whale holdings were relatively stable but began increasing significantly in early January 2025. CEO, a crypto analyst on X, commented on this surging accumulation trend, highlighting that whales have purchased over 1 billion Dogecoin in the last seven days. Martinez’s chart also shows that large amounts of Dogecoin were purchased between $0.314 and $0.355. These prices highlight areas where Dogecoin experienced notable volatility and a slight pullback, presenting a buying opportunity for investors. Dogecoin previously surged to new highs above $0.4 in 2024. However, a steep correction pushed its price back towards the $0.3 mark. Interestingly, the 470 million Dogecoin purchased by whales comes as the cryptocurrency experiences a steady bullish recovery in significant metrics. Crypto analyst Javon Marks disclosed that Dogecoin is forming a new Descending Wedge pattern. Additionally, a market expert on X, identified as ‘Rose Premium Signals,’ has revealed that Dogecoin’s macro charts are signaling a strong bullish structure as it accumulates near key support zones and aligns with long-term Fibonacci levels. DOGE Forms New Descending Wedge Pattern As mentioned earlier, Dogecoin is currently forming a new Descending Wedge pattern, signaling another potential price breakout. Marks stated in his X post that the popular meme coin is well positioned to continue another substantial bullish trend once it breaks out of this Descending Wedge pattern. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin’s 30% Decline A Chance To Buy On Discount? Here Is the Pertinent Level To Watch A Descending Wedge, also known as a Falling Wedge, is a technical chart pattern that indicates the potential for a price reversal or continuation. It is a bullish pattern that typically occurs during a downtrend, with its completion marked by a breakout above the upper trendline. Marks predicts that if Dogecoin breaks above the Descending Wedge pattern, it could hit a new ATH soon, reflecting a potential 120% increase. The analyst has revealed that this massive price gain could happen anytime soon, pushing Dogecoin from its current market price of $$0.33 to a new bullish target of $0.739.

The top global crypto exchange by trading volume listed aixbt by Virtuals ( AIXBT ), ChainGPT ( CGPT ) and Cookie DAO ( COOKIE ). CGPT, the native asset for ChainGPT, a web3 artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure project, witnessed particularly pronounced gains, ripping by about 105% from $0.2 to $0.41 in a 24-hour period between Thursday and Friday. The 301st-ranked crypto asset by market cap has given up some of its gains and is trading at $0.346 at time of writing. AIXBT is a crypto market intelligence platform developed by the Virtuals Protocol, an AI agent project. The altcoin surged from a 24-hour low of $0.385 to a high of $0.578 to record a 50% increase. AIXBT has retraced since and is trading at $0.477 at time of writing. Cookie DAO is an index and data layer for AI agents. The project’s native token, COOKIE, rallied over 61% in 24 hours from a low of $0.449 to a high of $0.725. At time of writing, COOKIE DAO is valued at $0.557. Binance attached a seed tag to all three assets. The exchange applies seed tags to lower-liquidity projects that could exhibit higher volatility compared to other listed tokens, and it requires users who want to trade assets with seed tags to pass quizzes every 90 days to ensure they’re aware of the risks.
