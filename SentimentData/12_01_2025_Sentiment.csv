Ethereum’s Role and Future in Blockchain Ecosystem Ethereum stands out for its innovation and versatility in the blockchain field. It is a leader in smart contract technology and decentralized applications, or dApps. Its ecosystem includes decentralized finance and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon to improve transaction speeds. Ethereum began in 2015 and shifted to a Proof-of-Stake model in 2022, enhancing its focus on decentralization. The planned sharding upgrade aims to improve scalability and reduce user costs. Ether (ETH), the network’s native currency, plays a key role. It is used for transaction fees and as a reward for stakers. Looking ahead, Ethereum appears promising based on historical price patterns, with significant growth expected by 2030. Conclusion While established tokens like ETH may see steady growth in the current bull market, Catzilla offers a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale stages. With governance features, loyalty rewards, and passive staking options, Catzilla aims to unite enthusiasts seeking financial freedom. Acquiring $CATZILLA tokens allows participation in a project poised for significant short-term gains.

Like many industry experts, Nate Geraci believes a major shift is coming to the ecosystem this year. XRP and Solana ETF Prospect In 2025 According to Nate Geraci, spot XRP and Solana ETF products will gain approval this year. As reported earlier by Coingape, asset manager VanEck filed the first Solana ETF product in the US in June 2024. Since then, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has welcomed other SOL ETF applications from Grayscale , Canary Capital, and 21Shares. While the Solana products are still under review, Canary Capital filed for XRP ETF in October 2023. This filing changed the crypto ETF outlook and inspired other asset managers to join the trend. While there is no definitive update from the US SEC, the confidence for approval remains high. The change in the US SEC leadership is a major catalyst many are citing will drive the approval. President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkins as US SEC Chair in the coming administration. Atkins is expected to redirect the SEC from its strict approach to crypto under Gary Gensler. Like other industry experts, Geraci believes 2025 will see the launch of Solana and XRP ETF products. The Nate Geraci Crypto ETF Predictions The ETF Store President shared 10 predictions on what to expect in the crypto ETF space. He believes spot Bitcoin ETFs will surpass the physical gold ETFs in assets under management. After one year of launch, several Bitcoin ETF milestones are now on record. The Bitcoin ETF products topped $150 billion Assets Under Management (AUM), a feat that took gold 20 years to achieve. Beyond the approval forecast for Solana and XRP ETF, Geraci also believes the U.S. SEC will approve Ethereum ETF staking this year. My 10 crypto-related ETF predictions for 2025… https://t.co/uDj1OCkaVQ pic.twitter.com/ye3zA2sinV — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) January 11, 2025 Meanwhile, he narrowed the predictions to include specific ETF filings from Grayscale and Bitwise, predicting approvals for both. He predicted that Vanguard would shift its stance and support crypto ETF trading. Donald Trump to Change the Tides President-elect Donald Trump will take office officially on January 20, creating a new era for the industry. Beyond Paul Atkins, Trump also named a Crypto and AI Czar, David Sacks, to help coordinate policies from the White House. As reported by Coingape, one of Sacks’ first tasks is to organize an inaugural crypto ball next week. As predicted by many experts, these trends will help fuel a robust shift in crypto regulation and enforcement. In addition to the Solana and XRP ETF approvals, price boosts are expected for both.

Predictions now indicate a possible surge up to $8. However, instead of the XRP price garnering investors’ interest, analysts have their eyes elsewhere. WallitIQ (WLTQ), a $0.042 altcoin, is stealing the spotlight with its impressive potential to generate 40,000% returns by Q1 2025. Ripple (XRP) May Hit $8 But WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Bring Jaw-dropping 40,000% Gains The XRP price is currently trading around $2.44, with predictions indicating a rise to $8. History shows that the XRP price often rises after new Ripple partnerships. For example, after Ripple Labs announced its partnership with MoneyGram in 2019, the XRP price saw temporary gains. Similarly, the XRP price saw fair hikes after Ripple Labs partnered with banks like Santander and American Express to promote its currency for cross-border payments. In August 2024, Ripple Labs began its partnership with the IMF, a move that is predicted to trigger an XRP price surge this year, perhaps up to $8. However, surges caused by partnerships are often short-lived and less than expectations, and smart analysts know this. Therefore, analysts are bullish on a surer option: a rising altcoin currently priced at $0.0420. This altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ), is not based on fleeting partnerships but on the latest AI technology, a factor that will inevitably trigger rapid adoption and jaw-breaking surges in Q1 2025. Already demonstrating its impressive potential, this altcoin generated over $6 million in the last presale stages as thousands of analysts bought over 350 million tokens. The ongoing presale, which is currently priced at $0.0420 per token, has recently started and has already generated over $200,000 from the sale of 5 million tokens. Analysts predict that this altcoin will effortlessly generate $5 million in monthly revenue by Q1 2025, ultimately dominating the $700 billion crypto wallet and AI market. While the XRP price surge to $8 due to the Ripple partnership is uncertain, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is expected to multiply investments by 40,000% in Q1 2025. Therefore, analysts advise investors to take advantage of this life-changing opportunity by joining the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale immediately. The $0.0420 price will not last for long, as hundreds of investors are joining the presale daily. For investors who want massive gains in Q1 2025, the best time to act is now. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Be The Next Game-Changer In Crypto A major reason why analysts are bullish on WallitIQ (WLTQ) despite the XRP price predictions is that this altcoin presents something more. This rising altcoin will change the scope of crypto trading with improved security and simplicity features. For instance, WallitIQ (WLTQ) uses a double-layered encryption process to protect transactions. It also features Escrow-connect, an AI-powered tool that double-checks external connections before establishing them. Additionally, WallitIQ (WLTQ) supports biometric authentication. Users can secure their accounts with fingerprints or facial recognition, which are more reliable than pins and passwords. This altcoin platform has publicly audited its smart contract with SolidProof , a top-notch and reliable smart contract auditing firm. Far from being complicated due to advanced security, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is very easy to use, even for beginners. It features a user-friendly interface that supports customizable widgets. The platform also contains a variety of educational resources to help investors learn as they trade. Conclusion While the XRP price is poised to hit $8 following the IMF partnership with Ripple Labs, its growth depends on short-term market reactions. Therefore, analysts are counting on WallitIQ (WLTQ), a highly innovative altcoin projected to grow 40,000% in Q1 2025. For any trader who wants to see massive gains in Q1 2025, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is the way to go. Coins are still going out for a token price of $0.0420, but not for long. With hundreds of investors joining daily, this price will skyrocket soon. Before that happens and you miss your chance, join the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale now.

Known for his active presence on social media, Schwartz recently warned about a new scam targeting crypto users. The Coinbase Impersonation Scam In a recent X post, Schwartz alerted the XRP Army about an alarming phishing tactic. Scammers posing as representatives of Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, are attempting to exploit users through fraudulent emails. The emails claim that recipients must review their account details to ensure seamless operations on the platform. Accompanying this, Schwartz shared an image of one such email, highlighting its deceptive design. Adding to the urgency, some community members confirmed receiving similar emails. One investor recounted receiving the email and a follow-up call from a Canadian phone number impersonating Coinbase support. Thankfully, the user remained vigilant and avoided falling victim to the scam. XRP Community Responds with Gratitude Schwartz has long been a guiding figure for the XRP community during his 12 years at Ripple, frequently sharing valuable advice. In a similar incident in 2024, the Ripple CTO revealed that scammers had tried to contact him by text and email. As mentioned above, the bad actors posed as the ‘Asset Shielding Department’ in the exchange. The phishing attempt aimed to deceive Schwartz into sharing his personal information, presumably to gain unauthorized access to his assets or sensitive data. Schwartz’s swift action earned him accolades from the XRP community. Many expressed gratitude for his vigilance, with one user dubbing him a “true community caretaker.” Others echoed the sentiment, appreciating his consistent efforts to safeguard the ecosystem. A Growing Threat of Crypto Scams The rise of digital assets has brought innovation and opportunity, but it has also increased illicit activities like phishing scams. These scams often target unsuspecting users, tricking them into revealing sensitive information or transferring funds. Many users have fallen victim to such schemes, losing access to their accounts and hard-earned assets. Industry leaders and regulatory agencies are taking proactive measures to combat the rise in scams . As seen in Schwartz’s recent tweet, companies like Ripple are educating users about security threats and sharing timely warnings. Exchanges also enhance their security protocols, implement two-factor authentication, and monitor suspicious activity. Regulatory agencies have introduced stricter guidelines to protect users. Governments worldwide are cracking down on fraudulent activities, requiring exchanges to verify user identities and report suspicious transactions. Some agencies have also launched public awareness campaigns to help users recognize and avoid scams.

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-11 21:24:00

As the weekend approaches, Tether has performed exemplary, topping the weekly revenue chart with $122.78 Million in fees for the last seven days. The latest data from DefiLlama shows the revenue performance of different sectors within the crypto ecosystem. The data shows that stablecoin issuers are performing well. This weekly fee revenue data highlights the success of protocols that focus on providing value to users willing to pay for services rather than relying solely on token price speculation. The revenue data indicates a change in crypto trading. Early crypto traders depended on price surges, while current traders relied on earning fees from actual services, including payment processing, lending, trading, and blockchain usage fees. The dominance of Tether in fee generation, followed by Circle ($33.33 Million) and Ethereum ($30.33 Million), shows how critical financial infrastructure commands the highest user payments. Source: DefiLlama Stablecoins are putting up top performance in the blockchain ecosystem Tether’s weekly revenue of $122.78 Million shows how critical stablecoins have become to crypto’s financial system. The fee accumulates from transaction costs as users always transfer USDT across different blockchains. Tether supports 11 networks, including Ethereum, Tron, and Solana. Circle appeared second among stablecoin issuers, after generating revenue worth $33.33 Million in weekly fees. The pattern gives a clear indication that the need for digital dollars in crypto payments has gone up. Layer-1 blockchains have not been left far behind in fee generation. Solana raised a $35.06 million weekly fee, outperforming Ethereum’s $30.33 million and Tron’s $13.37 Million. The fees show that the Solana network attracts more transactions due to more active users. Liquid staking is also generating a lot of revenue. Jito appears at the top with $43.42 Million earned in weekly fees, with Lido generating $20.78 Million across several chains. There is an increase in demand for staking services that give users a way to earn yield without interfering with liquidity. DeFi protocols are keeping up as their performance is promising Most DeFi revenue comes from decentralized exchanges, with Raydium earning $43.36 Million in weekly fees. Uniswap, which is running in more than 22 chains, earned $31.97 Million in weekly fees. Lending platforms like Aave managed $15.32 Million, way below Raydium and Uniswap, which shows that the current market supports trading more than lending. Uniswap has a straightforward revenue model; its fee comes from traders paying to swap tokens. The lending sector, under the DeFi protocol, drives a narrative of a market condition.

Expert Breaks Down The Potential Path",https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/7000-ethereum-in-sight-expert-breaks-down-the-potential-path/,"There is a reason for Ethereum fans to be optimistic, as expert analysis suggests that the cryptocurrency is going to touch the skies in the coming months. As Bitcoin has just crossed $94,000, Ethereum also shows signs of life and bounces back from its recent low and hints at the possibility of price explosion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Remains Below $95k: Analyst Says It’s a Golden Time to Accumulate—Here’s Why A Quick Look At The Patterns Well-known crypto analyst Ali Martinez has found a bullish reversal pattern that can potentially take the price of Ethereum into much higher value. Trading at $3,281 at the moment, Ethereum has slipped below the middle line of its rising channel and has traders spooked. But Martinez is one who thinks if Ethereum could just retest the lower boundary at $2,800 and rebound, it will likely launch into a bullish trend. This rebound may eventually set the stage for Ethereum to reach between $6,000 and $7,000. If #Ethereum $ETH is following an ascending parallel channel, a dip to the lower boundary at $2,800 could act as a launchpad for a move toward $6,000. pic.twitter.com/uYP6BW3DZh — Ali (@ali_charts) January 10, 2025 Market Sentiment & Challenges Even though these are all good signs, the mood in the futures market right now is not clear. Open interest in Ethereum has gone down by 1.25%, which shows that some buyers are becoming more cautious. The long-to-short number is still less than 1, which means that traders are betting against Ethereum instead of for it. Also, funding rates have gone down a lot, which shows that people are less interested in taking leveraged long bets. Although short-term sentiment may be negative, long-term holders may see attractive entry points at current prices. Due to their inherent volatility, cryptocurrencies require constant vigilance and awareness of market trends. Key Resistance Levels All eyes will be on Ethereum’s performance and whether it can overcome important resistance thresholds as we advance into 2025. Several elements determine whether one may achieve $6,000 or even $7,000: market conditions, investor mood, and more general economic impact. At the time of writing, Ether was trading at $3,274, down 0.9% and 9.9% in the daily and weekly timeframes, data from Coingecko shows. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Bounce Back?

Ether is expected to rise by a solid 93% in six months and 94% in three months, according to predictions by CoinCheckup.

So why are so many investors moving over to Rollblock (RBLK), and how will Ethereum fare in the next quarter?

Ethereum has also now brought proto-danksharding onto the Ethereum (ETH) network which has gone a long way to reducing gas fees.

What started as a joke or a mere fad has turned into a legitimate investment avenue, attracting both seasoned investors and curious newcomers. In a world where traditional markets are often volatile, meme coins have emerged as a refreshing alternative, creating unique opportunities for short-term gains. This trend has drawn in a wave of enthusiastic investors eager to cash in on the latest buzz, and trust me, it’s a wild ride. Over the years, meme coins have captured the hearts (and wallets) of millions. From Dogecoin’s meteoric rise to Shiba Inu’s massive community, these playful tokens have shown they can pack a punch in the market. But now, we’re entering a new era with exciting contenders like BTFD Coin that promise to elevate the meme coin phenomenon to dizzying new heights. With features like a play-to-earn game, a lucrative referral program, staking rewards, and a strong community backing, BTFD Coin is not just another meme coin—it’s a game-changer. BTFD Coin is making waves in the presale arena, raising over $5.1 million in just its first month, and it’s not slowing down. As we dive deeper into this article, we’ll explore why BTFD Coin stands out among the best new meme coins to invest in for the short term, comparing it with established names like Brett and Cheems. So, buckle up; we’re about to delve into the nitty-gritty of these exciting projects and see what sets them apart. BTFD Coin: The New Contender in Meme Coins BTFD Coin is the latest player in the meme coin game, and it’s already making headlines. Currently in its 13th presale stage, with a price of just $0.000142, this coin has already sold over 63 billion tokens and amassed a remarkable tally of over 8,000 holders. But what’s really turning heads is its phenomenal presale performance, having raised over $5.1 million in such a short time. Investors are buzzing, and many are already eyeing it as one of the best new meme coins to invest in for the short term. The hype around BTFD Coin isn’t just about numbers—it’s about potential. Analysts are predicting that, with the right momentum, the price could reach $0.0006 by the end of the presale. Let’s break that down. If an investor puts in $35,000 at the current price, they’d snag an impressive 246,478,874 $BTFD Coins. When the price hits $0.0006, that investment could balloon to a staggering $148,000. That’s the kind of short-term gain that gets folks talking! But what’s more exciting is the community aspect of BTFD Coin. This isn’t just a token; it’s about building connections among holders. The referral program incentivises users to bring in new investors, creating a buzz that can drive the price even higher. Plus, the staking rewards mean that those who hold onto their coins can earn while they wait for the price to rise. As the community grows, so does the potential for profits, making BTFD Coin one of the best new meme coins to invest in for the short term. Brett: A Steady Player in the Meme Coin Space Now, let’s talk about Brett. This meme coin may not have the explosive growth of BTFD Coin, but it’s been a steady player in the meme coin market. Brett has built a loyal following, and investors appreciate its stability compared to the often chaotic nature of meme coins. But in a market that thrives on excitement and potential, does Brett still hold its ground as one of the best new meme coins to invest in for the short term? One of the things that set Brett apart is its consistent community engagement. The developers have worked hard to keep the community informed and involved, which has fostered a sense of loyalty among holders. Plus, with its recent updates and enhancements, Brett is showing it’s not just sitting on its laurels. Yet, while it has its strengths, the question remains whether it can compete with the fresh energy that BTFD Coin brings to the table. While Brett has its advantages, the current market sentiment seems to favour new entrants that promise quicker returns. Investors looking for fast profits may be swayed to BTFD Coin, especially given its impressive presale results. However, Brett’s reliability might appeal to those who prefer a more measured approach. In a nutshell, while Brett has its merits, it’s essential to weigh its stability against the potential gains offered by BTFD Coin. Both may have a place in a diversified portfolio, but right now, the spotlight is firmly on BTFD. Cheems: The Meme King Still in the Game Ah, Cheems—the beloved meme coin that has garnered a cult following. It’s been a fan favourite for a while now, but the question is: can it keep up with the new kids on the block like BTFD Coin? Cheems has proven to be a resilient player in the meme coin arena, but its ability to compete for the title of the best new meme coins to invest in for the short term is under scrutiny. Cheems has established a strong community, and its playful branding has certainly helped it capture the hearts of many. However, the meme coin market is ever-evolving, and the excitement surrounding new projects like BTFD Coin is hard to ignore. While Cheems has its strengths, it’s possible that the novelty of newer coins could overshadow its longstanding reputation. Investors looking for a quick turnaround may find Cheems a bit too slow for their liking. With BTFD Coin’s impressive presale performance and dynamic features, it’s no wonder many are flocking to the latter. That said, Cheems still has a loyal base that appreciates its consistency. The challenge lies in whether it can innovate and adapt to the changing landscape of meme coins. In conclusion, while Cheems has remained a solid player in the meme coin market, the recent buzz around BTFD Coin could shift the attention and investment away from it. For those seeking the best new meme coins to invest in for the short term, the choice may lean more towards BTFD, especially with its community-driven features and impressive presale figures. Conclusion: The Future Belongs to the Bold Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that BTFD Coin is shaking things up in the meme coin space. Its impressive presale performance, innovative features, and strong community engagement make it a standout contender among the best new meme coins to invest in for the short term. While Brett and Cheems have their strengths, they may not be able to keep pace with the excitement and potential that BTFD Coin offers. Investors looking for a quick return should seriously consider joining the BTFD Coin presale now. With its potential to explode in value and a community that’s passionate and active, BTFD Coin is paving the way for the future of meme coins.

Recent analysis and sentiment metrics suggest the asset may be on track for a continuation of its bullish trajectory, potentially reaching new all-time highs. Cointelegraph recently highlighted XRP’s price behavior, stating it is preparing for a “powerful move” above the $2.9 mark. This comes as optimism grows within the XRP community, with both technical and on-chain indicators aligning to reinforce a positive outlook. LATEST: $XRP price preps for ‘powerful move' above $2.90 as sentiment metrics signal optimism, suggesting that it’s gearing up for a run to new all-time highs. pic.twitter.com/bstTXx3Uib — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) January 10, 2025 Key Technical Levels Analyzing the digital asset’s 4-hour chart, several critical levels and zones emerge. At the time of Cointelegraph’s analysis, XRP traded at $2.3168, with a recent bounce off the support area of $2.1558 that sent it as high as $2.5. This support zone corresponds to an order block, a region of prior accumulation, that has historically served as a launchpad for upward momentum. Cointelegraph also highlighted a fair value gap (FVG) near the $2.1558–$2.2 range, indicating inefficiencies in price movement that may attract bullish interest. The market may revisit this area before a sustained rally takes place, as liquidity and support converge here. On the resistance side, the daily chart shows a key resistance zone around $2.5. Breaking through this range would likely signal a continuation of XRP’s broader uptrend, potentially pushing it above $2.9. Beyond this, the psychological $3 level could be a magnet for price action, supported by both technical setups and increasing market confidence. If XRP can sustain its momentum, it could reach a new all-time high in no time. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Sentiment and Market Factors The sentiment surrounding XRP remains positive, bolstered by its spectacular performance in late 2024, and its resilience in early 2025. The digital asset has stayed above $2 level for weeks now, and with the positive signs on its chart, it could soon turn the $3 level to support, and potentially target its all-time high of $3.84. At press time, XRP had risen to $2.32 slightly higher than its price at the time of Cointelegraph’s analysis. Other factors could also contribute to XRP’s momentum as it targets the $2.9 threshold. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently met with President-elect Donald Trump and described this meeting as a strong start to 2025 . This meeting and Trump’s upcoming return to office and the resignation of Gary Gensler, current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have set the stage for a massive bullish resurgence.

SUI’s price has recently reached a new high of $5.35, a 20% increase in just 10 days, driven by solid technical signals and increased acceptance. Conversely, Litecoin’s future value is uncertain as it strives to recover from a 40% decline from its December high of $147.22. In this environment, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out with its advanced GHOSTDAG technology and the aggressive LAUNCH300 campaign, which gives a 300% boost on BDAG purchases. Having raised over $179 million, and with analysts expecting its price to hit $1 by 2025, the Layer-1 project is drawing significant attention from large-scale participants and developers. This piece explores the recent developments and future prospects of these promising projects. The Latest 300% Bonus Boosting BDAG Toward $1 BlockDAG Network has been making significant strides in marketing since its inception, quickly securing over 170,000 participants. This Layer 1 project has been prominent for over a year, gaining additional traction as it nears its mainnet launch. A key highlight of BlockDAG’s initiatives is the LAUNCH300 campaign, offering a hefty 300% bonus on BDAG acquisitions. Seen as a potential Kaspa competitor, the project is surrounded by optimistic forecasts, with some analysts predicting it could reach $1 by 2025. BlockDAG continually exceeds expectations on many levels. Its swift transaction capability of 10 blocks per second has attracted both crypto specialists and large-scale participants, while rapid advancements toward mainnet launch have spurred a successful presale, amassing over $179 million worldwide. With plans for establishing a Swiss foundation, allocating grants, and maintaining an active low-code/no-code platform, BlockDAG’s path forward appears robust. With BDAG priced at $0.0248 during the presale, and large-scale participants leveraging the LAUNCH300 code, many view this as an excellent opportunity for long-term engagement. Litecoin’s Price Fluctuations: Can LTC Climb to $184 or Dip Further? Litecoin’s future price trajectory is unpredictable as it currently trades below the crucial $110 resistance mark. Despite an impressive 120% surge in late 2024, Litecoin has struggled to keep up the pace, falling 40% from its December high of $147.22. Nevertheless, LTC has managed to uphold its descending resistance trend line as support twice, signaling a possible upturn. With RSI and MACD showing neutral readings, there are no definitive signs of a bullish breakout or a continued downfall. The wave analysis hints that Litecoin might be embarking on its fifth upward movement, eyeing $184 as per Fibonacci retracement levels. The pivotal $110 level will likely shape its long-term trajectory. Until there’s a significant market move, Litecoin’s future price remains a balanced play of hope and caution. Will SUI Continue to Climb or Retreat? The SUI price has surged remarkably, setting a new record at $5.35, following a rapid 20% increase in just ten days. This surge has eclipsed major altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. Since November 2024, SUI has been charting a bullish path within a rising channel, bolstered by solid technical indicators such as RSI and SMA. Having surpassed a $2 billion Total Value Locked (TVL) with 69.75% of its tokens locked, SUI’s potential remains strong. If the momentum persists, SUI may revisit its peak and target $6.60. Conversely, a downturn could see it approaching critical support near $4.50. SUI continues to draw significant interest due to its robust growth and potential for long-term appreciation. Summing Up the Top Cryptos In 2025, Sui, Litecoin, and BlockDAG each offer distinct prospects within the cryptocurrency space. SUI’s recent peak of $5.35 and its substantial $2 billion TVL underscore its robust expansion potential, possibly pushing toward $6.60. On the other hand, Litecoin faces a cautious path, as it struggles to breach the $110 mark aiming for $184, with essential technical support being crucial. BlockDAG, meanwhile, shines with its advanced GHOSTDAG protocol, rapid transaction capabilities, and the impactful LAUNCH300 campaign, which has helped gather $179 million in crypto presale . For those looking to diversify, the upward trajectory of Sui, the potential recovery of Litecoin, and the pioneering technology of BlockDAG present strong cases for consideration.

According to the local press, the man has been forced to move his family from one Airbnb to the next because the police are apparently unable to guarantee their safety. Criminals Intended to Torture Victim Speaking about the attempted kidnapping, the father of four told the Quebec newspaper La Presse that his would-be abductors had been prepared to mete out violence on him and his children to achieve their goal. He said they had torture equipment and probably intended to cut one of his limbs using a two-foot by two-foot tarpaulin with a hole in the middle and claws around it. The victim’s ordeal began on November 4, 2024, when two masked men threatened him outside his house, but he managed to lock his door before they could gain entry. On November 8, he claimed to have noticed a black car without a license plate parked near his home, prompting him to contact the police. A few days later, the man said he found himself behind the same strange vehicle on a main road before it suddenly swerved, causing him to pull over. One of the car’s occupants then reportedly pulled a gun on the unidentified individual, forcing him to use pepper spray to defend himself. Following investigations, police arrested four suspects, with two of them appearing in court in November 2024, accused of plotting an abduction and being in possession of illegal firearms. Having no prior criminal records, the alleged assailants were released on bail and confined under house arrest until March 2025, when their trial was scheduled to begin. The move left the crypto enthusiast living in fear, as he suspected his attackers may have links to organized crime, compelling him to find temporary accommodation in different places. According to the police, the culprits targeted the victim, believing he owned 2.5 million BTC after being misled by posts on a Facebook page he had been moderating for the last few years. However, the man claims his Bitcoin holdings may be worth only $10,000 at most. Rising Threats According to Casa co-founder Jameson Lopp, there have been more than 100 physical attacks on BTC holders in the last few years. In October 2024, the crypto security expert launched an archive chronicling several violent encounters digital asset owners had faced, including stabbings in New York City and kidnappings in Lithuania and Turkey. This latest case signals rising crypto-related abductions, especially in Canada. In November last year, Dean Skurka, CEO of prominent crypto firm WonderFi, was reportedly hijacked in Toronto and forced to pay $720,000 to secure his release. In the same month, Montreal police discovered the body of crypto influencer Kevin Mirshahi, who had been kidnapped earlier in the year along with three others. Mirshahi had been accused of promoting a pump-and-dump scheme involving a cryptocurrency called Marsan (MRS), whose value plummeted by more than 90%, causing untold losses to thousands of investors.

In a decisive move, CEO Eric Turner has confirmed the layoff of 15% of the company’s workforce. This shift aims to sharpen focus on what Messari does best: delivering top-tier crypto data and insights. For now, the company has chosen not to announce the changes formally, but the impact is clear. “Streamlining for Growth”: The New Messari Direction The layoffs include full-time employees and contractors whose terms were not renewed. Notably, this is a common step for businesses at the start of a new year. Messari’s decision struggles in the crypto industry, with companies like Kraken, Sky Mavis, and Paxos cutting jobs. Even competitor CoinDesk has weathered multiple layoffs, signaling an industry-wide belt-tightening. For Messari, this is not a retreat; it is a refocus. Founded in 2018, the company has built a reputation for clear analytics, reliable pricing data, and its popular Mainnet conference in New York. These layoffs could signal a pivot toward consolidating its strongest assets. Ryan Selkis Fuels The Messari Legacy of Vision and Controversy Messari was started by Ryan Selkis, a leader known for being influential and controversial. Selkis pushed the company forward with big ideas, but his strong opinions on social media caused problems. In one case, he argued with critics of President-elect Donald Trump and made harsh comments during a political debate. Eventually, Selkis stepped down, saying his outspoken nature had put the company at risk. Turner’s Steady Hand in a Shifting Market Selkis’s departure paved the way for Eric Turner, a calmer and more focused leader, to take charge. Turner’s promotion to CEO marked a turning point. Under his leadership, Messari has shifted its approach. The firm moved from Selkis’ grand vision of hiring 1,000 analysts to a more streamlined, efficiency-driven model. Despite recent challenges, Messari remains a heavyweight in the crypto research space. Backed by financial giants like Point72 Ventures and Galaxy Digital, the company raised $35 million in its series B funding round in 2022 . Turner’s plan focuses on helping Messari’s smaller team deliver great insights while staying competitive. Messari’s restructuring is part of a larger story unfolding across the crypto world. After years of fast growth, companies face tough choices and must plan carefully. For Messari, this could be the fresh start it needs to succeed in a market where survival depends on focus and innovation.

Pepe Rescues Trump (PEPERTRU), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPERTRU is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Rescues Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Rescues Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Rescues Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Rescues Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Rescues Trump by entering its contract address – HtgdKmNDff2UgXmmJYCryKhjVE2F89XMncNt8oThipHz – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPERTRU. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-11 22:50:00

Over the past 24 hours, FTM price has rebounded and has now crossed the $0.7 resistance level per current market data. Drawing on the Sonic hype, this current Fantom rebound might usher in more uptick soon. The Sonic Chain Milestone and Ecosystem Trend According to Sonic Chain’s update, it has reached the $100 million Total Value Locked (TVL) milestone. The protocol recorded this milestone in less than 6 weeks since the Sonic Genesis block went live . $100 Million TVL. pic.twitter.com/UKICYqrv0k — Sonic Labs (@SonicLabs) January 11, 2025 While this milestone is significant, it is not the first for the protocol. Per an earlier update from Coingape, Sonic Chain breached the 1 million block milestone about 3 weeks after it launched. The total value locked is a metric that depicts the cumulative amount of capital resident on the blockchain. Since its inception, Sonic Labs, the previous Fantom, has released some Decentralized Applications (DApps) on the protocol. An Ethereum bridge went live in late December 2024 to chart a strong foundation for the network. Implication for Fantom Price While the Sonic Chain has its native token, S, most of the advances within its ecosystem impact Fantom’s price the most. When writing, the coin changed hands for $0.7206, up by 2.82% in the past 24 hours. Amid the drawdown of the past week, the price of FTM jumped from a low of $0.6929 to a high of $0.7296 before resting at its current level. Fantom had a rocky year in 2024, with a combined growth of 71%. This 52-week growth rate pales compared to its core rivals like Solana (SOL), which has jumped 90%. Meanwhile, Sonic Labs seeks to change the future for Fantom through the new chain. With better speed, connectivity, and a robust ecosystem, the expectation is that FTM may breach the $1 mark in the short term. The Altcoin Season Advantage Amid the push for relevance in the broader blockchain ecosystem, Sonic Chain and Fantom may benefit from the price surge the expected altcoin season might usher in soon. In a recent update, Santiment data shows HODLer count growth for Ethereum , Dogecoin, and other top altcoins. This metric shows a broader market confidence for these chains, a trend that may impact Fantom if it persists. In addition, the incoming Donald Trump administration is poised to benefit altcoins, considering the President-elect’s family is pro-DeFi.

Sui’s impressive all-time high of $5.36 and Sei’s steady price gains are grabbing attention. However, Web3Bay is emerging as the real game-changer in blockchain-based commerce. Known as the “Amazon of Web3,” Web3Bay delivers lower fees, full transparency, and direct buyer-seller rewards. Unlike traditional marketplaces, it cuts out middlemen to create a fairer system. Its presale is a chance to get in early on what many see as a promising project. For those exploring cryptos with real-world utility, Web3Bay could lead the next wave of decentralized e-commerce. Web3Bay: A New Era for Blockchain Commerce Web3Bay is rapidly becoming a leader in decentralized commerce, often called the “Amazon of Web3.” By combining blockchain’s strengths with the simplicity of an online marketplace, it delivers exactly what buyers and sellers need—lower fees, better transparency, and direct rewards. Unlike Amazon, Web3Bay removes middlemen, creating a peer-to-peer system where users get the full benefits without additional costs. This unique approach makes it one of the underrated cryptos to watch now. The ongoing presale is gathering pace, allowing early adopters to purchase 3BAY tokens at $0.0039675 during stage three. The presale has already raised over $580,000, with each stage seeing a 15% price increase. Early participants could achieve a return on investment (ROI) of over 6,430%, mirroring the early days of Amazon when those who believed in its potential reaped major rewards. What sets Web3Bay apart from others is its user-focused system. Sellers earn better margins, buyers gain rewards, and blockchain ensures total transparency in transactions. The platform is building for the future, with plans to introduce staking and cross-chain compatibility to increase flexibility. For anyone exploring underrated cryptos with real-world applications, Web3Bay could be the game-changer of 2025, poised to revolutionize decentralized e-commerce. Sui Hits New All-Time High of $5.36 – What’s Driving the Surge? Sui recently reached a new milestone, with its Sui all-time high hitting $5.36. As a Layer 1 blockchain known for its low-latency, high-speed transactions, Sui has quickly become a favorite for DeFi applications. Its unique parallel transaction model allows developers to build fast, scalable dApps, making it a strong contender in the blockchain industry. The network’s TVL has crossed $1.85 billion, reflecting growing trust from the community. Partnerships, such as with Franklin Templeton Digital Assets, and the upcoming AI integrations are adding further momentum. Despite minor setbacks like the November 2024 network outage, Sui remains a solid choice for blockchain enthusiasts. Sei Price Holding Strong – What’s Supporting Its Stability? The Sei price remains steady at $0.38874, continuing to show resilience in the ever-changing crypto market. Sei’s blockchain, designed for decentralized exchanges (DEXs), has carved out a niche by offering ultra-fast transaction times of just 380 milliseconds. Recent developments are fueling Sei’s stability, including the planned Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, set for release in 2024. This upgrade will make it easier for developers to bring their smart contracts to Sei, attracting a wider range of users. As the ecosystem grows with platforms like DragonSwap and Pallet Exchange, Sei’s long-term potential remains strong. Final Takeaway: Why Consider Web3Bay? With Sui’s all-time high reaching $5.36 and the Sei price holding firm at $0.38874, both blockchains show strong promise in their respective areas. Sui’s focus on scalable DeFi solutions and Sei’s ultra-fast DEX capabilities make them popular picks. However, Web3Bay stands out by bringing blockchain into everyday use through decentralized commerce. Dubbed the “ Amazon of Web3 ,” Web3Bay’s presale offers early adopters the chance to secure 3BAY tokens before they rise in price. With its practical marketplace features and a focus on user rewards, Web3Bay has the potential to reshape online retail for good. As more crypto enthusiasts take notice, it could prove to be one of the most promising opportunities of 2025.

The altcoin leader’s decline comes amid heightened market volatility and uncertainty, with many investors reevaluating their positions following the recent selloff. However, despite the downturn, on-chain data suggests that underlying investor sentiment remains robust. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Major Deleveraging – Analyst Explains Price Crash Below $100K According to data from IntoTheBlock, Ethereum saw significant outflows from exchanges this week, with net outflows surpassing $1.4 billion—the highest level since November. Such activity often signals strong accumulation trends as investors move their holdings off exchanges and into cold storage or other wallets, indicative of long-term confidence in the asset. These substantial outflows underscore Ethereum’s resilience even amid challenging price action. Analysts are closely monitoring whether these accumulation trends can offset the bearish momentum and spark a recovery in the coming weeks. With Ethereum trading near critical support levels, the next moves will be pivotal in determining the direction of its price in 2025. As bullish seasonality for altcoins often kicks in during post-halving years, many believe that Ethereum could soon reclaim its upward trajectory, contingent on both market conditions and broader macroeconomic factors. Ethereum Prepares For Rebound Ethereum has shown signs of recovery after its recent drop, now attempting to break above the $3,300 level. The altcoin leader has faced considerable challenges, with a 15% decline from its recent highs putting pressure on bullish sentiment. However, key on-chain metrics indicate that Ethereum’s fundamentals remain strong, pointing toward potential growth in the coming months. Data from IntoTheBlock, shared on X, highlights a significant development: this week saw net $ETH outflows from exchanges exceeding $1.4 billion, the highest level since November. Such substantial outflows often signal that investors are moving their holdings off exchanges, a behavior typically associated with accumulation. This trend suggests that, despite recent bearish price action, confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential remains intact. While Ethereum’s recent price action may appear underwhelming to some, these accumulation trends provide a bullish underpinning for the asset. Historically, large exchange outflows have preceded significant price rallies, as reduced sell-side liquidity can drive upward momentum when demand increases.

As Ethereum works to reclaim higher levels, breaking above $3,300 could signal the beginning of a more sustained recovery. With strong fundamentals and growing investor confidence, Ethereum appears well-positioned for a potentially bullish 2025. However, the asset must navigate current market volatility to confirm its uptrend. Testing Weekly Demand Ethereum is trading at $3,250, reflecting ongoing struggles to break above the $3,300 resistance level. The price action remains tentative as ETH tests critical weekly demand levels. This area has historically provided strong support, and if Ethereum manages to close above the $3,100 mark, it could pave the way for a meaningful rebound in the coming days. The current consolidation phase highlights a market looking for direction. For bulls to regain control, Ethereum must break above key resistance levels. Reclaiming the $3,750 mark is crucial to confirm a bullish breakout and signal a potential uptrend. Such a move would not only restore investor confidence but also position ETH to retest higher levels as market sentiment shifts. However, failure to hold the $3,100 demand zone could lead to further downside pressure, with lower support levels likely to be tested. The coming sessions will be pivotal as Ethereum navigates these key levels. Related Reading: Key Metrics Reveal Bitcoin STH Support Levels Around $89K–$86K – Is BTC At Risk? With the broader market sentiment in flux, ETH’s ability to stay above its critical support zones will determine whether a bullish trend emerges or a prolonged consolidation phase persists.

This development coincided with the 16th anniversary of Bitcoin’s first-ever mention on Twitter, a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency history. Blockchain trackers have identified a series of large transactions involving unknown wallets and major exchanges, raising questions about the motive behind these significant transfers. $903 Million in Bitcoin Moves Across Wallets and Exchanges According to the data from the blockchain analytics service Whale Alert , there have been 10 large Bitcoin transactions in the last 24 hours with the total transaction amount of about 903 million BTC. The transfers primarily involved changing between addresses of unknown entities and cryptocurrency exchanges like Kraken, Binance and Robinhood. Among the largest ones, there were 620 BTC for $58.4 million, 888 BTC for $83.8 million, and 1,027 BTC for $96.7 million sent from Kraken to various unknown wallets. Also, 1,164 BTC or $109,700,000 was transferred between the wallets with unknown owners, and Robinhood sent 600 BTC or $56,800,000 to another unknown wallet. There was also much action on Binance as 999 BTC valued at $93.6 million was transferred from an unknown wallet. The same pattern continued with 1,881 BTC worth $176.5 million being sent to Kraken from other anonymous wallets. These movements have raised questions into whether the activity is related to sales, purchases or over the counter transactions. Potential Reasons Behind Bitcoin Transfers The cause of such a significant volatility of BTC price remains unknown, but there are several hypotheses. Transfers to exchanges like Kraken and Binance are usually a signal of the sellers while withdrawals to unidentified addresses could be a signal of accumulation. OTC trading can also be another possible reason because it enables buyers and sellers to transact large volumes of crypto without necessarily affecting the general market. Due to the fact that some of the wallets can be anonymous, it is difficult to establish the exact final intent for these transactions. Others have suggested that this could be due to some form of market positioning or potential future market event or institutional reallocation of assets. Nevertheless, without more information, the motives for these transfers are uncertain. BTC Marks 16th Anniversary of $0 Value Tweet The timing of these transactions coincides with Bitcoin’s 16th anniversary of its first-ever public mention. On January 11, 2009, Hal Finney, one of Bitcoin’s earliest supporters, tweeted, “Running Bitcoin.” This marked the cryptocurrency’s debut on social media and has since become a historic milestone in its journey from obscurity to global recognition. At the time, Bitcoin price was at $0, as adoption and utility were still in their infancy. Since then, Bitcoin’s price has risen dramatically, currently trading at $94,306. Although it remains far from Hal Finney’s long-term prediction of $10 million per coin, its progress continues to inspire confidence among investors. Bitcoin Price Rally Looming? At present, Bitcoin’s price is trading slightly below its recent all-time high (ATH) of $108,268, reached in December 2024. Despite this, analysts believe that the market remains in a bullish phase. On-chain data from Glassnode indicates that Bitcoin’s long-term holders are still in profit, with no significant loss-making among this group. As Bitcoin remains just over $94,000, some traders anticipate further price volatility in the near term. A correction to around $91,000 has been suggested as part of an Elliott Wave price analysis, but some forecasts predict that Bitcoin could reach as high as $210,000 before mid-February 2025.

Shiba Inu Bullish & INJ Resilient,https://thecoinrise.com/protect-your-shopping-experience-with-web3bay-580k-raised-in-presale-shiba-inu-bullish-inj-resilient/,"In the digital currency market, both well-established coins and emerging projects are marking their presence. The Shiba Inu market trend showcases a robust 14% increase in its value, pushing its market cap to $14 billion, although it faces potential hurdles from rising selling pressures. Similarly, Injective’s (INJ) performance is on the upswing with a 16% increase, spurred by a deflationary policy and the buoyant mood around Bitcoin’s growth. Amidst these financial waves, Web3 in e-commerce is carving out a niche as Web3Bay (3BAY) tackles increasing concerns about data privacy. In its third presale stage, having amassed over $580,000, Web3Bay fuses blockchain technology with e-commerce, crafting a decentralized marketplace that underscores security, transparency, and worldwide user accessibility. Shiba Inu Market Trend: A Look at Its Speculative Surge The Shiba Inu market trend has been in the spotlight recently due to a 14% rise in value over the past week, boosting its market cap to $14 billion. This upturn highlights a moderately bullish phase, with the RSI at 60.8, hinting at potential room for further growth. However, with decreasing ADX values and growing sell-offs, this upward trend might meet resistance. Analysts are eyeing a potential golden cross which could thrust Shiba Inu towards pivotal resistance levels at $0.0000298. Alternatively, an increase in bearish sentiments could guide the Shiba Inu market trend towards a consolidation phase, where crucial support levels at $0.000022 or $0.0000185 will be key in determining its next movements. INJ’s Performance: Deflationary Tactics & BTC’s Ascent Injective’s performance is commendable, with a 16% surge reinforced by strategic enhancements in its ecosystem and enthusiasm over Bitcoin’s potential rise to $100,000. INJ’s price escalated to $26.33, paired with a substantial 127.27% increase in trading volume, highlighting heightened market activity and growing investor interest. Central to this surge is Injective’s proposed 3.0 governance model, designed to amplify its deflationary mechanism through streamlined token burns and staking incentives, reducing overall supply. This strategy aims to reinforce INJ’s value in the crypto market as it strives to regain its peak of $52.75. Web3Bay: Pioneering a Secure Path in E-commerce The 2023 MOVEit data breach shed light on the critical vulnerabilities within centralized e-commerce platforms, sparking a demand for more secure and transparent shopping alternatives. Traditional online shopping platforms not only lack in protecting user data but also impose heavy fees, which can stifle small business growth. Web3Bay (3BAY) is addressing these critical issues by merging blockchain technology with e-commerce, ensuring a secure and reliable space for users to conduct transactions online. Now in its third presale stage, the 3BAY token is available at just $0.0039675. So far, the presale has successfully raised over $580,000 and seen more than 160 million tokens purchased. With projections pointing to a price of $0.1959 at launch, early investors could see an impressive 6430% return on investment. By leveraging web3 in e-commerce , Web3Bay eliminates middlemen, offering worldwide access, faster transactions, and enhanced security for personal data. It’s a platform that not only prioritizes transparency but also reaches out to the underbanked, ensuring an inclusive shopping experience. Both traders and consumers are drawn to Web3Bay’s revolutionary model, which promises to reshape online marketplaces and offers significant potential returns for its early backers. With ongoing reports of data breaches, Web3Bay is increasingly recognized as a dependable option for secure and efficient online shopping. Embrace the Future of E-commerce with Web3Bay While the Shiba Inu market trend and Injective’s performance garner attention, Web3Bay is making significant strides in redefining e-commerce through blockchain. Shiba Inu’s notable rise reflects its growing appeal, and Injective continues to impress with its substantial gains, fueled by deflationary policies and Bitcoin’s momentum. Simultaneously, Web3Bay is tackling critical issues such as data privacy and secure online transactions head-on. With significant funding and an impressive number of 3BAY tokens sold, Web3Bay is establishing new benchmarks for Web3 in e-commerce. At the current presale price, investors have the opportunity to partake in what could be a transformative force in the fusion of cryptocurrency and online commerce.

SUI’s price has recently soared to a new high of $5.35, marking a 20% increase in just 10 days, driven by robust technical signals and increased acceptance. In contrast, Litecoin’s future value remains uncertain as it struggles to recover from a 40% decline from its December high of $147.22. Amid these developments, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making significant strides with its modern GHOSTDAG technology and the aggressive LAUNCH300 campaign, which provides a 300% bonus on BDAG purchases.

BlockDAG Projects for $1 as LAUNCH300 Offers Goes Viral! BlockDAG Network (BDAG) has been vigorously marketing since its debut, quickly amassing over 170,000 holders in a few months. The Layer 1 project has remained in the limelight, gaining momentum as it nears its mainnet launch. A key highlight is the LAUNCH300 campaign, providing a significant 300% bonus on BDAG purchases. Often referred to as a Kaspa Killer, the initiative is prompting optimistic price forecasts, with some analysts suggesting it might reach $1 by 2025. BlockDAG continues to exceed expectations in various areas. Its rapid transaction capability of 10 blocks per second has attracted crypto experts and enthusiasts, and swift advancements toward mainnet development have supported a prosperous presale, accumulating over $179 million worldwide. With plans for establishing a Swiss foundation, allocating grants, and enhancing a low-code/no-code platform, BlockDAG’s path forward looks bright. With BDAG priced at $0.0248 during the presale, and enthusiasts eagerly utilizing the LAUNCH300 code, the project is seen as a promising long-term prospect. Will LTC Climb to $184 or Decline Further? The future price of Litecoin is currently uncertain as it trades below the crucial $110 resistance level. Following a significant 120% rally in late 2024, Litecoin faced challenges in sustaining its growth, with a 40% drop from its December high of $147.22. Despite these setbacks, LTC has consistently found support at its descending resistance trend line, hinting at a possible recovery. Neutral readings from technical indicators such as the RSI and MACD show no definitive signs of a bullish surge or continued downfall. The wave analysis indicates that Litecoin could be approaching its fifth upward wave, aiming for $184 based on Fibonacci retracement levels. However, the movement around the $110 mark will be crucial in defining its long-term trajectory. Until a definitive trend is established, predictions for Litecoin’s price will continue to balance cautious optimism with prevailing uncertainty. SUI’s Record High: Will It Reach $6.60? SUI’s price trajectory has been remarkable, reaching a new all-time high of $5.35, marking a 20% increase in just ten days and surpassing major altcoins such as Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. SUI has been trading within a bullish channel pattern since November 2024, supported by strong technical indicators like the RSI and SMA. The project has now exceeded $2 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL), with 69.75% of its supply locked, suggesting it is still undervalued. If the current bullish trend persists, SUI might challenge its recent high again and target a new milestone at $6.60. Conversely, a downward turn could see its price drop to significant support levels near $4.50. SUI continues to be a strong candidate for long-term growth, drawing sustained interest with its robust performance. Final Say As we look towards 2025, Sui, Litecoin, and BlockDAG each offer distinct prospects in the crypto market. SUI’s recent all-time high of $5.35 and its impressive $2 billion TVL underscore its potential to climb towards $6.60. Meanwhile, Litecoin’s prospects remain mixed as it strives to overcome the $110 resistance and aim for $184, underpinned by crucial technical support. On the other hand, BlockDAG is rapidly emerging with its cutting-edge GHOSTDAG protocol and swift transaction capabilities, enhanced by the LAUNCH300 campaign’s success, which has led to a $179 million crypto presale achievement. For those looking to diversify their holdings, the upward trends of Sui, the potential recovery of Litecoin, and the pioneering technology of BlockDAG present compelling opportunities.

This article highlights the top 4 crypto wallets for 2025: Plus Wallet, Binance Web3 Wallet, Uniswap Wallet, and SafePal Wallet. Each of these wallets offers top-tier security and a range of advanced features, such as hardware wallet integration, lightning-fast token listings, and earning opportunities. This in-depth guide will help users evaluate the benefits of each wallet, making it easier for users to choose the top crypto wallet for securing assets and grabbing profitable opportunities in the year ahead. 1. Plus Wallet: Maximize Gains and Minimize Effort Plus Wallet has secured its place among the top 4 crypto wallets today with its efficiency, security, and earning opportunities. One standout feature is its quick 15-minute token listings, where new tokens are live on the platform within just 15 minutes. This allows traders to engage with fresh options and seize potential opportunities as soon as they launch. In addition, Plus Wallet offers a unique Swap to Earn feature where users earn rewards for every single trade they make.

With no limits on swaps or referrals, this creates a simple and steady, passive income opportunity for users that requires no extra effort, just regular trading. All of this is supported by strong security, a user-friendly interface, and advanced tools designed to streamline users’ trading experience. This combination of speed, security, and gains makes Plus Wallet the best among the top 4 crypto wallets for 2025. 2. Binance Web3: The Trusted Crypto Wallet Binance Web3 Wallet offers strong support for multiple cryptocurrencies, allowing users to manage different assets in one place. It's known for security features and includes SegWit and Bech32 address options, adding flexibility. The wallet also has built-in exchange functionality, allowing users to easily swap assets. As part of Binance, one of the most trusted names in crypto, it provides an added layer of reliability. However, it may not be the best choice for beginners due to its complexity, and customer support could be improved. Additionally, users who prioritize complete decentralization might prefer alternatives, given its connection to a centralized exchange. 3. Uniswap Wallet: Easy Ethereum Swaps Uniswap Wallet, available as a mobile app and Chrome extension, provides a straightforward user experience with a built-in swap function that mirrors the Uniswap web interface. This feature allows users to easily swap tokens within the wallet without a learning curve. The wallet also includes a “Buy” function, enabling users to purchase popular cryptocurrencies using various payment methods, through third-party processors with associated fees. Mobile app users can connect to any DApp through browsers without needing additional extensions. However, Uniswap Wallet is limited to Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens, which may restrict its use for other blockchain assets. 4. SafePal: The Reliable Cold and Hot Wallet Option SafePal is a multi-platform wallet offering robust security features, including an app, a browser extension, and a cold wallet option. It supports cross-chain swaps and spot trading, allowing users to buy crypto with credit or debit cards. The wallet is compatible with thousands of coins and tokens and includes NFT storage. However, some users have raised concerns about the security of the S1 hardware wallet, especially considering its price of $49.99. While the wallet offers value, it's essential to weigh the price against potential security risks for those considering its use. Find Your Best Fit Among the Top 4 Crypto Wallets Each of these wallets offers distinct benefits, making them the top four crypto wallets for 2025. SafePal Wallet is ideal for users looking for a versatile option, offering both hardware and software solutions. However, there have been some complaints about the hardware model in the past. Uniswap Wallet is a great pick for those holding Ethereum-based assets, offering a versatile platform tailored to this ecosystem. Binance Web3 Wallet stands out for its advanced security features, ensuring asset protection for users. Finally, Plus Wallet earns its spot as number one among the top 4 wallets for 2025 , thanks to its rapid token listings, strong security, and unlimited rewards—all available through a simple and intuitive mobile app. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

PropiChain and SUI tokens are suitable alternatives traders are looking up to due to their unique AI integration. Experts further state that PCHAIN has the potential to deliver 30,000x in the coming weeks due to its RWA impact. Below we will discuss the XRP price action resistance and why SUI and PropiChain serve as an alternative to investors. Why traders are considering PropiChain and SUI as the XRP Price alternatives After an incredible rally late last year, the XRP price has failed to go above $2.5 for some days now. Although it had over 6% growth in the last 7 days, regardless, the XRP price has been hovering around $2.3, and the total market cap dropped by 5% to $133.98B. This has got some traders on the lookout for alternatives. SUI is among the hottest projects at the moment and it keeps trying to gain momentum. The project recently announced its plans to integrate AI to enhance its efficiency and security. SUI’s plan to integrate AI and the recent rally the project had positioned it as a great alternative for traders as the XRP price action loses momentum. Also, experts believe PropiChain , a crypto AI project that aims to revolutionize the real estate sector is a great alternative as the XRP price action keeps facing resistance. This project is a decentralized real estate marketplace that offers solutions to the primitive issues in the sector. This token has been gaining traction and a massive inflow of investors, which is evident from the success of its first presale round, where the project raised more than $1.3 million. The project has now crossed $2 million from presale and it is not slowing down. Investors are taking advantage of the discounted entry price of $0.011 in the second presale round to position for the potential 30,000x ROI. Many tipped this token to dominate the real estate and AI market. CoinMarketCap has listed the project which added to its visibility, and audits from BlockAudit boost traders’ confidence in the project. PropiChain Will Dominate Real Estate With its AI Offerings and Other Features PropiChain’s increasing traction and speedy token presale stages are due to its connection to the multi-trillion industry. With its decentralized marketplace, PCHAIN plans to make real estate better via innovations and this helps it edge SUI. Some of the benefits expected when PropiChain is launched include: Advanced Property Filtering PCHAIN’s artificial intelligence will help investors in real estate with property filtering and recommendations quicker and better. This PropiChain innovation will go beyond basic search criteria and employ advanced filters to improve efficiency and investors. For instance, investors can use prompts like possible growth and expected ROI to search for suitable assets. Asides from filtering, PropiChain AI can recommend properties to investors based on their previous searches. Predictive Market Insights Investors need all the help they can get to make profitable decisions. PropiChain marketplace offers this by using AI to appraise market situations and historical statistics. The vast statistics that will be available on this decentralized platform are far beyond the ones mediators reach in the conventional real estate market. The AI will evaluate market trends, property values, and investment opportunities, and this will enhance the predictions’ accuracy and result in strategic investment decision-making for investors. Accurate Property Valuation Getting accurate coats of assets has been a major concern for real estate investors. Overpricing, underpricing, and additional costs imposed by brokers and agents are common concerns. However, with PCHAIN’s AI, getting the actual cost of the property will be easier. This is because the AI will use the vast available information, both historical and present, to calculate real-time prices. PropiChain ’s AI will also take over most intermediary roles to save costs and stress. This also promotes efficiency in the trillion-dollar marketplace. Fractional Ownership PropiChain aims to make real estate more inclusive by breaking the barriers hindering investors. Since its inception, the industry has been reserved for wealthy investors because not everyone can afford huge entry capital or costly mortgages. However, with the real estate fractional ownership model that PropiChain offers, property acquisition will now be easier for investors. For instance, you can pay as low as $1000 for a portion of assets that is worth $650,000 to $700,000 while other investors contribute the remaining capital. Conclusion With the resistance faced by the XRP price, it is wise for investors to find alternatives. PropiChain comes to mind not only because it aims at improving the trillion-dollar industry but also because of its AI integration, which is the sought-after narrative in the crypto market. PropiChain is currently going for $0.011 at the second presale phase, and this is the lowest entry investors will get because the entry price will increase in the third round, and it will rally from there. An investment of $1000 could potentially yield more than 8 figures profit for investors. The XRP price faces its challenges; however, SUI and PropiChain serve as the beacon of hope for investors and Ripple traders are determined to harness the AI-driven insights of PropiChain for smarter, faster, and more secure real estate transactions.

The scam involved a post that read, “LTC is now in Solana,” The hacker wrote a now-deleted and grammatically incorrect post featuring a contract address and a pump.fun link to the scam token. The Litecoin team later announced that they had resolved the matter. They noted that they were now in control of the account and said the attack was due to a compromised delegated account that had since been deleted. Hackers are increasingly targeting social media accounts to promote fake tokens Hacking social media accounts to promote fake projects or tokens is common among crypto-criminals. The Litecoin incident is the latest in a series of high-profile X account hacks targeting organizations and individuals to promote fake tokens and phishing schemes. These scams aim to steal funds and sensitive user data, underscoring the need for heightened cybersecurity measures. In October, Andy Ayrey, Truth Terminal’s founder’s X account, was attacked. The hacker used the access to promote a token called “IB” and walked away with $600 million in net profit. During the same month, Restaking protocol, EigenLayer’s X account was hacked to promote a fake airdrop campaign. The hacker posted several malicious links from the account, advertising the “Season 2 Stakedrop,” which they falsely claimed was sourced from reallocated EIGEN tokens before the EigenLayer team regained control. At the beginning of November, rapper Wiz Khalifa’s account was also compromised. The hacker took the opportunity to promote a fake celebrity memecoin called ‘WIZ’ on the account. The threat actor linked the token with the musical artist. Hackers target Cardano Foundation and Animoca Brands On December 8 Cardano Foundation’s X account was also compromised, with attackers posting false information about an alleged SEC lawsuit and promoting a fraudulent token (ADAsol).

Elon Buys Solana (ELONBSOL), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Buys Solana launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 85b1Mza2zF6SDGXZURjeu53wdapN6W1UjFC4PAqhKE8k – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBSOL.

These quirky tokens, born from internet culture, have a way of capturing the imagination and wallets of investors. From the early days of Dogecoin to the wild ride of Shiba Inu, these coins have shown that sometimes, the biggest returns come from the most unexpected places. Now, if you think you’ve missed the Bonk party, hold up! BTFD Coin is stepping into the spotlight, and it’s shaping up to be one of the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. With a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, a killer referral program, and staking rewards offering a whopping 90% APY, BTFD Coin is ready to take meme coin popularity to new heights. What sets BTFD Coin apart is not just its meme-worthy branding but the actual utility it brings to the table. Launched in a presale that’s already raised over $5.1 million, BTFD Coin has captured the interest of over 8,100 holders, affectionately known as “Bulls.” The excitement surrounding its features is palpable. With the P2E game going live on January 1, 2025, and staking rewards that promise impressive returns, BTFD Coin is not just riding the wave of meme coin hype; it’s creating its own tidal wave. So, as we dive into this article, let’s explore how BTFD Coin stacks up against Bonk. We’ll break down the latest developments, analyst predictions, and what makes BTFD Coin the standout choice for anyone looking to invest in the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. Buckle up, because we’re about to uncover why this could be one of the smartest moves you make this year. BTFD Coin: The Future of Meme Coins BTFD Coin has exploded onto the scene and is making waves that are hard to ignore. With its presale currently in the 13th stage at a price of $0.000142, the coin has already sold over 63 billion tokens. That’s no small feat! As of January 10, 2025, the presale has brought in a staggering $5.1 million, showing that investors are keen on what BTFD has to offer. But what’s all the fuss about? One of the standout features of BTFD Coin is its Play-to-Earn game , which launched on January 1, 2025. Imagine diving into a game that not only entertains you but also rewards you in crypto. Players can earn while they play, making it a fun way to engage with the community and build wealth simultaneously. Talk about a win-win! And let’s not forget the staking aspect. BTFD Coin offers an incredible 90% APY on staking, which is practically unheard of in this space. If you’re thinking about passive income, this is where you want to be. On December 2, staking went live, and investors have been flocking to get in on the action. The referral program is the cherry on top. Invite your friends, and you can earn rewards together. The more, the merrier, right? Now, think about this: if you invested $20,000 when the presale started at just $0.000004, you’d snag an impressive 5 billion BTFD coins.

This substantial purchase comes amid Dogecoin’s bullish recovery in key metrics, as analysts project a significant push to the upside. Dogecoin Whales Buy 470 Million DOGE Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed on X (formerly Twitter) on January 11 that Dogecoin whales have begun accumulating again. Martinez announced the latest DOGE acquisition by these deep-pocketed investors, highlighting that Whales recently bought over 470 million tokens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Unravels 157-Day Fractal Similar To Last Cycle, Why A Surge To $169,000 Is Possible This substantial DOGE purchase, which occurred in the last 48 hours, is valued at approximately 155 million based on current market prices. Such large-scale whale activity often signals a renewed interest in the cryptocurrency, potentially influencing market sentiment and trends. Martinez shared a chart presenting data related to Dogecoin, focusing on the behavior of whales holding assets spanning from 10 million to 100 million DOGE. The shaded area on the chart highlights the cumulative holdings of these wallets owning millions of DOGE. Around late December 2024, Dogecoin whale holdings were relatively stable but began increasing significantly in early January 2025. CEO, a crypto analyst on X, commented on this surging accumulation trend, highlighting that whales have purchased over 1 billion Dogecoin in the last seven days. Martinez’s chart also shows that large amounts of Dogecoin were purchased between $0.314 and $0.355. These prices highlight areas where Dogecoin experienced notable volatility and a slight pullback, presenting a buying opportunity for investors. Dogecoin previously surged to new highs above $0.4 in 2024. However, a steep correction pushed its price back towards the $0.3 mark. Interestingly, the 470 million Dogecoin purchased by whales comes as the cryptocurrency experiences a steady bullish recovery in significant metrics. Crypto analyst Javon Marks disclosed that Dogecoin is forming a new Descending Wedge pattern. Additionally, a market expert on X, identified as ‘Rose Premium Signals,’ has revealed that Dogecoin’s macro charts are signaling a strong bullish structure as it accumulates near key support zones and aligns with long-term Fibonacci levels. DOGE Forms New Descending Wedge Pattern As mentioned earlier, Dogecoin is currently forming a new Descending Wedge pattern, signaling another potential price breakout. Marks stated in his X post that the popular meme coin is well positioned to continue another substantial bullish trend once it breaks out of this Descending Wedge pattern. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin’s 30% Decline A Chance To Buy On Discount? Here Is the Pertinent Level To Watch A Descending Wedge, also known as a Falling Wedge, is a technical chart pattern that indicates the potential for a price reversal or continuation. It is a bullish pattern that typically occurs during a downtrend, with its completion marked by a breakout above the upper trendline. Marks predicts that if Dogecoin breaks above the Descending Wedge pattern, it could hit a new ATH soon, reflecting a potential 120% increase. The analyst has revealed that this massive price gain could happen anytime soon, pushing Dogecoin from its current market price of $$0.33 to a new bullish target of $0.739.

This allows early backers to support a project and potentially benefit from lower prices and exclusive perks. It offers a chance to contribute to the project’s goals while possibly earning rewards. For the developers, presales provide essential funding to develop their technology, grow their user base, and enhance community involvement. It helps attract a dedicated group of early users who provide valuable input for future improvements. Web3Bay: Facilitating Easier Crypto Transactions Web3Bay distinguishes itself by integrating regular online payment methods like PayPal and credit cards with blockchain. Unlike typical blockchain platforms that only accept crypto, Web3Bay offers more payment flexibility. This inclusive approach invites newcomers to the blockchain by allowing them to sell items and accept payments in fiat or digital currencies. This flexibility caters to various user comfort levels, encouraging more people to explore decentralized commerce. Some users may prefer traditional payment methods, while others may delve deeper into Web3 functionalities. Web3Bay’s integration of both payment worlds aims to broaden user adoption across its platform. Web3Bay Embraces Decentralized Governance Web3Bay plans to evolve into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), where control is spread across its user base. Token holders have the power to propose and decide on changes to the platform. This democratic approach allows for a diverse range of ideas and promotes transparency, as all proposals and voting outcomes are recorded on the blockchain. Although larger stakeholders have more influence, the goal is to keep the platform equitable for all participants. By involving users in decision-making, Web3Bay nurtures loyalty and cooperative development, contrasting with conventional centralized governance models. Scaling Decentralized Commerce for Efficient Transactions To manage numerous transactions efficiently, Web3Bay incorporates Layer-2 solutions that handle transactions off the main chain. This setup lowers transaction costs and increases processing speed. The use of auto-scaling servers ensures the platform performs well during peak usage, adjusting resources dynamically to maintain speed and reduce costs. Why Consider Web3Bay’s Crypto Presale? Web3Bay’s presale provides an opportunity for early backers to purchase tokens that are crucial for a widely applicable marketplace. The platform has impressively amassed over $580,000 rapidly, advancing to its third presale phase with tokens priced at $0.0039675. Unlike purely speculative tokens, these offer genuine utility in both the transactions and governance aspects of the platform. Early participants not only potentially benefit from an increase in token value but also acquire the ability to influence decisions through voting. This active involvement allows the community to directly shape the development of future partnerships, enhancements, and policy modifications. The presale targets users interested in a system that combines the ease of Web2 with the innovations of Web3. Despite inherent risks like possible delays or market volatility, Web3Bay stands out by integrating practical commerce applications. Interested buyers are encouraged to conduct thorough research, as the potential advantages include contributing to a marketplace that supports both fiat and digital currencies. Summarizing the Appeal of Web3Bay’s Approach Understanding the mechanics of a crypto presale is crucial to appreciating what Web3Bay offers. By incorporating conventional payment methods, empowering community governance, and ensuring robust infrastructure, the platform appeals to both traditional and cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Participants can engage in purchases using either fiat or digital currencies and progressively immerse themselves in governance and staking opportunities. This strategy simplifies the transition to decentralized commerce, making it more accessible and less daunting for newcomers. However, it remains vital for potential participants to assess the project’s trajectory and current market trends. Should Web3Bay achieve its objectives, it could exemplify the successful fusion of standard e-commerce frameworks with blockchain innovations. For those seeking convenience coupled with new opportunities, this presale offers a chance to get involved at an early stage and help shape a marketplace designed to be inclusive and responsive to all user contributions. Web3Bay’s Expanded Vision: A Community-Centric Marketplace Web3Bay’s strategy encompasses inclusive access, user-driven governance, and adaptable technology. By participating in the presale, early adopters gain the opportunity to guide the platform’s evolution through governance rights and impact updates directly. As the project matures, it is expected that user feedback will drive the introduction of new partnerships and the expansion of offerings, such as additional payment options and broader product categories. This method of transparent governance distributes responsibility among its users, fostering a deeper sense of ownership that transcends the traditional consumer-seller model. Web3Bay aspires to redefine the online marketplace by prioritizing user engagement, enhancing operational efficiency, and lowering the hurdles to entry. For those eager to participate in a system that combines the ease of Web2 with the innovations of Web3, Web3Bay’s presale presents a distinct chance to contribute to the next generation of e-commerce .

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 01:40:00

Meanwhile, the Avalanche (AVAX) ecosystem continues to shine, recording $17.7 billion in swap volume and showcasing its growing influence in DeFi and beyond. But all eyes are on BlockDAG , whose early 2025 mainnet launch will be a game-changer. With plans to list on 10 top exchanges, the enhanced liquidity and accessibility are set to drive the coin’s value higher, solidifying its potential as 2025’s next big crypto. Ethereum Upgrade ‘Serenity’ Sparks Market Optimism in 2025 The Ethereum upgrade, dubbed “Serenity,” marks a pivotal advancement for the blockchain network, focusing on improved scalability, security, and energy efficiency. This milestone transition to a proof-of-stake mechanism drastically reduces energy consumption, a move welcomed by both environmental advocates and crypto enthusiasts. The enhanced transaction speed and lower fees are expected to appeal to developers and users alike, particularly as smart contract functionalities become more robust. Market reactions to the Ethereum upgrade have been overwhelmingly positive, with its price surging by 12% in just two days. This progress cements Ethereum’s status as a frontrunner in blockchain innovation. Avalanche (AVAX) Ecosystem Surpasses $17.7 Billion in Swap Volume The Avalanche (AVAX) ecosystem continues to demonstrate its scalability and efficiency, recording $17.7 billion in swap volume across 4.8 million transactions over 90 days. With 454,000 unique participants driving this activity, the ecosystem’s decentralised applications (dApps) are proving highly effective in meeting diverse user needs. Notable trends include the dominance of WAVAX in swap volume and USDC as the most frequently used stablecoin, highlighting the versatility of the Avalanche (AVAX) ecosystem for both high-value traders and retail users. This surge in activity underscores the network’s role in supporting innovative projects, fostering adoption across DeFi, NFTs, and community-driven tokens. 2025 Mainnet Launch: BlockDAG’s Big Leap in the Crypto Space The early 2025 mainnet launch of BlockDAG is more than a technological upgrade—it’s a defining moment for the project’s trajectory. By combining scalability, high performance, and a vision for decentralised financial systems, this milestone marks BlockDAG’s entry into the upper echelons of blockchain networks. With its advanced infrastructure, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a serious contender for the next big crypto, capturing the attention of blockchain enthusiasts and analysts alike. The launch is anticipated to establish new benchmarks, enhancing its appeal to both developers and traders in an increasingly competitive space. In preparation for this transformative launch, BlockDAG has announced plans to list its BDAG coins on ten top tier-two and tier-three exchanges. This strategy paves the way for broader access, fostering greater liquidity and adoption across global markets. Such moves ensure the network’s ecosystem remains dynamic and accessible, giving it the momentum needed to meet its ambitious goals. BDAG’s growing presence on these platforms is expected to unlock new opportunities, driving interest from a diverse audience of retail and institutional participants. BlockDAG’s journey is just beginning, but its achievements so far set the tone for an exciting future. With its record-breaking presale hitting over $179 million and the coin’s value already soaring 2380%, BDAG’s potential seems boundless. Analysts predict its price could climb to $1 this year, fueled by the mainnet launch and exchange listings. These developments are more than milestones—they’re stepping stones toward cementing BlockDAG’s place in the blockchain world. Missing out on BlockDAG could mean watching 2025’s next big crypto from the sidelines. The Bottom Line: Why 2025 is Crypto’s Next Era The crypto industry is entering an exciting phase as projects push boundaries in 2025. Ethereum’s Serenity upgrade has sparked renewed interest, setting the stage for a greener, faster, and more efficient network. Avalanche (AVAX) continues to impress with its ecosystem’s $17.7 billion in swap volume, demonstrating its appeal to a diverse range of users. But the boldest moves come from BlockDAG. With its early 2025 mainnet launch and upcoming exchange listings, BlockDAG is shaping up to be a frontrunner. Analysts are already predicting exponential value growth for BDAG, and those who act now may secure a front-row seat in this unfolding success story.

BitTorrent Chain ($BTTC) has ignited discussions with its target of reaching $5 by 2025. In contrast, Stacks, a key Bitcoin Layer 2 network, encountered a five-hour disruption that paused transactions. In this landscape, Web3Bay (3BAY) has positioned itself as a noteworthy new web3 blockchain initiative. With an anticipated return on investment of 6,430%, the platform’s presale has quickly attracted a significant following. Already, Web3Bay has secured $580K and distributed over 160 million coins. As it progresses, the platform aims to offer a novel approach to blockchain investment. BitTorrent Price Target: Can $5 Be Reached by 2025? The possibility of BitTorrent Chain ($BTTC) achieving a $5 price target within the next couple of years has stirred much debate among crypto enthusiasts. This target hinges on the platform’s growth trajectory within the expanding Web3 framework. $BTTC is establishing itself as an essential element of decentralized infrastructure with its decentralized applications and peer-to-peer sharing features. Nevertheless, reaching this price milestone will require overcoming substantial challenges, including its large circulating supply, which demands significant market demand or strategic token burns. Stacks News: A Brief Interruption for the Layer 2 Network Stacks, a prominent Bitcoin Layer 2 solution, recently faced a five-hour outage, halting its block production temporarily. This incident, caused by decreased signer activity, has brought to light the scalability challenges of blockchain networks. In response, Stacks mobilized its developers to work closely with the signers, ensuring a quick resolution. This event occurred shortly after the Nakamoto Upgrade, aimed at increasing transaction speeds and enhancing network security. Despite the upgrade’s potential, the recent downtime exposed some ongoing issues with network capacity. Notably, this happened as Stacks announced that its total BTC supply had topped 1,000, a sign of its expanding reach. 6430% ROI Opportunity—Web3Bay’s Attractive Pricing! Web3Bay (3BAY) is reshaping the future of e-commerce with a groundbreaking platform that fully embraces blockchain technology. This initiative not only makes buying and selling straightforward but also integrates the use of digital assets in daily transactions. What makes Web3Bay standout is its commitment to ensuring that all dealings are secure, clear, and outside the grip of any central authority. The early success of Web3Bay’s presale, which has already generated $580,000 and moved over 160 million tokens, underscores the growing interest from investors. As the price of 3BAY tokens is poised to climb with each presale stage, now presents a strategic time to get involved. Investors jumping on board today will not only benefit from lower prices but are also likely to see higher returns as the project scales up. With an anticipated ROI of 6430%, Web3Bay offers a unique opportunity for those looking to get in early on an innovative web3 blockchain venture. As demand surges and the supply of tokens dwindles, the chance to join this innovative venture at a favorable price is rapidly closing. As Web3Bay garners more attention within the crypto world, early adopters will find themselves well-placed in a project primed for significant expansion. Closing Thoughts The cryptocurrency sector is filled with potential yet accompanied by considerable challenges. BitTorrent’s $5 price goal is ambitious, facing obstacles from competitors and market dynamics. Likewise, Stacks has dealt with operational issues that highlight the intricate demands of scaling blockchain technologies. Amid these developments, Web3Bay shines as a promising web3 blockchain project. Its successful presale has raised substantial funds and distributed millions of tokens at a compelling price of $0.0039675. With a projected ROI of 6430%, Web3Bay presents a unique chance for early investors to capitalize on before prices climb further.

Despite this setback, the meme coin leader still maintains a bullish structure, holding above a crucial demand zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Major Deleveraging – Analyst Explains Price Crash Below $100K Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared compelling on-chain data, revealing that whales have been actively accumulating DOGE during this downturn. In the last 48 hours alone, over 470 million DOGE tokens have been acquired by large holders, suggesting confidence in the asset’s potential recovery and long-term value. This significant accumulation indicates strong institutional and whale interest, even as the broader market remains uncertain. Dogecoin’s resilience at current levels reflects its ability to capture investor attention, especially during volatile periods. With the broader market searching for direction, DOGE’s ability to maintain its bullish structure could pave the way for a substantial rebound. Dogecoin Prepares For A Big Move Dogecoin is demonstrating resilience as it holds firm above the $0.33 mark, despite a notable drop from its recent local highs. This level has become a key demand zone for the meme coin, serving as a foundation for potential recovery and upward momentum. Market analysts and investors are closely monitoring DOGE’s price action, anticipating a continuation of its upward trend, as expectations for a strong rally this year grow. Martinez recently highlighted compelling on-chain data on X, revealing that whales have accumulated over 470 million DOGE within the last 48 hours. This surge in whale activity during a period of price consolidation underscores a growing confidence among large holders in Dogecoin’s long-term prospects. Historically, such accumulation has often been a precursor to significant price movements, as institutional and high-net-worth investors position themselves for the next big move. Related Reading: Key Metrics Reveal Bitcoin STH Support Levels Around $89K–$86K – Is BTC At Risk? The bullish whale activity adds a layer of optimism for Dogecoin, even as the broader market navigates through a period of uncertainty. With smart money actively accumulating, DOGE appears to be in a strategic accumulation phase, setting the stage for a potential breakout. If this trend continues, Dogecoin could attract renewed retail interest and reclaim higher levels, further solidifying its position as one of the most-watched assets in the crypto space. Price Analysis: Key Supply Levels Dogecoin is trading at $0.33, showing resilience as it holds above the critical $0.31 demand level despite recent market volatility. This support zone has provided a solid foundation, but the price continues to face significant resistance in its path to recovery. Every day that DOGE remains below the $0.40 mark increases the risk of a deeper correction, putting pressure on bulls to reclaim higher levels to sustain the bullish structure. For Dogecoin to regain momentum and inspire confidence among investors, the price must break above the $0.40 mark and hold it as support. This level is a key psychological and technical barrier, and reclaiming it would signal strength, encouraging further buying pressure. Beyond $0.40, the $0.43 mark becomes the next critical target. A breakout above this level would pave the way for Dogecoin to enter price discovery mode, potentially reaching new highs.

However, with recent whale activity and strong demand at current levels, Dogecoin has the potential to reverse its downtrend and resume its upward trajectory. The coming days will be crucial as the market watches for a decisive move.

While Bitcoin continues to hold its position as the dominant force, altcoins are showing strong growth potential. From the well-established Ethereum (ETH) to the emerging BIG BOSS INU, these digital assets are set for significant gains. Investors are closely watching these top picks, as they are likely to surge before the market truly takes off. BIG BOSS INU’s Presale: A Promising Start in Crypto BIG BOSS INU is making waves in the crypto world, with its presale launch drawing considerable attention from investors. The project is positioned as a high-reward opportunity for those who get in early. Interest around its presale is rapidly increasing, making BIG BOSS INU one of the most watched cryptos at the end of 2024. With cutting-edge features and a bold development roadmap, BIG BOSS INU is poised to see significant growth in the coming months. >>>>>> Ethereum (ETH) has gained momentum after the successful implementation of the Dencun upgrade, which significantly reduced transaction fees on Layer-2 networks. This development is expected to drive broader adoption of Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dApps), though analysts are cautious about a potential short-term price correction. Currently, ETH is stabilizing around $3,350. Polygon (MATIC) saw strong gains, benefiting from Ethereum’s upgrade, with prices rising by 8-10% prior to the event. If buying pressure continues, MATIC could potentially rise to $2, although it faces some resistance near the $0.47 mark. TRON (TRX) has maintained its solid market position, with steady interest from investors. Though it has seen slight fluctuations, TRX remains a key player in the crypto space, with traders closely watching its performance. >>> Arbitrum (ARB) has also surged following the Ethereum upgrade, gaining around 6% over the last 24 hours. ARB may continue upward, with a potential target of $0.7, though it faces resistance at $0.75. Conclusion : As Bitcoin approaches $150K, altcoins like BigBossInu, Ethereum, Polygon, TRON, and Arbitrum are positioned for strong gains. BIG BOSS INU’s promising presale, Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade, and the growth of Polygon and Arbitrum highlight their potential. With the market rallying, these cryptos could see substantial returns by 2025. Always research carefully and consider risks in the volatile crypto market.

With XRP benefiting from favorable developments, Solana maintaining its position as a leading blockchain platform, and the new altcoin offering early-stage growth potential, 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for these projects. Ripple (XRP) Surge on Legal and Market Tailwinds Ripple’s new rise in price has caused fresh interest in the crypto, pushed by good news in its law fights and more big firms getting on board. XRP has made itself a top pick for cross-border payments because of its quick transaction times and small costs, which have drawn deals with money groups worldwide. Main ͏reasons for XRP’s rise are better legal clarity, with new court decisions giving a brighter view for Ripple and lessening rule doubts. Also, banks and money groups are more and more using Ripple’s payment tools, which has raised need for XRP. Fresh trust from buyers has also helped to lift XRP’s price, making it one of the best stars in start of 2025. With its strong utility and regulatory progress, analysts anticipate that XRP’s momentum could lead to further price increases in the months ahead. Solana (SOL) Eyeing $600 in 2025 Analysts predict that SOL could reach a price range of $260 to $600 by 2025, driven by its increasing adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). A cup-and-handle pattern identified on the weekly chart indicates the potential for a price surge to $600, with an extended bull cycle target of approximately $1,827. Additionally, Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has reached $9.215 billion, setting a new all-time high and reflecting growing momentum in the DeFi sector. Moreover, Solana has surpassed Ethereum in attracting new developers, with 7,625 developers joining its ecosystem in 2024, positioning it as the leading ecosystem for developer growth this year. These developments collectively support an optimistic outlook for Solana’s price trajectory in the coming years. New Altcoin Gaining Investor Interest While projects like Ripple and Solana often steal the spotlight, Lightchain AI is quietly emerging as a favorite among savvy investors. Positioned at an early-stage price, Lightchain AI combines cutting-edge innovation with real-world practicality. Its affordability offers significant growth potential for those looking to invest early. What sets Lightchain AI apart is its strong emphasis on real-world applications, making it more than just another speculative token. As adoption rises and interest surges, momentum is quickly building around this promising project. With predictions of exponential growth, Lightchain AI presents a high-risk, high-reward opportunity that could rival—or even surpass—some of the biggest names in the market.

While Bitcoin targets an all-time high of $120,000, Dogecoin continues to rally, riding on its community-driven momentum. Amidst this excitement, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is emerging as the sleeper pick with explosive growth potential, poised to surge from $0.004 to $2 or more in the coming months. Dogecoin Riding the Meme Coin Wave to New Heights Dog coin (DOGE), the first funny money, has always counted on its faithful group and fun culture ties to push rise. New changes, like more big player care and Elon Musk’s steady support, have helped DOGE's new climb. With fresh attention, watchers think Dogecoin might reach new tops if it keeps its push. But, Dogecoin'͏s worth stays linked to market guessing, with few real-world uses. Although it does well as a token driven by community, its chance for growth is not as great as new projects like Lightchain AI which mix tech progress with strong group involvement. Bitcoin King of Crypto Targeting $120K Bitcoin, often hailed as the King of Crypto, has recently surpassed the $100,000 milestone, reflecting its dominant position in the cryptocurrency market. Analysts project further growth, with forecasts suggesting Bitcoin could reach $120,000 in the near future. This optimism is fueled by several factors, including the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have attracted significant institutional investment. Additionally, the election of President Donald Trump, who has expressed support for cryptocurrencies, has bolstered market confidence. However, it's important to note that Bitcoin's price is highly volatile and influenced by various factors, including regulatory developments and market sentiment. While the current trajectory appears promising, potential investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. Lightchain AI Rising Star Ready for a $2 Surge AAmid Dogecoin’s rally and Bitcoin’s climb, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is quietly emerging as a standout project in the crypto space. Having raised an impressive $9.4 million during its presale, it’s drawing attention for its innovative fusion of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Lightchain AI’s ability to execute decentralized AI computations gives it real-world utility in industries like logistics, healthcare, and predictive analytics, setting it apart from speculative tokens. The platform is also fostering ecosystem growth with strong developer support through grants and resources for building dApps, ensuring long-term adoption. With a presale price of $0.004 and a projected rise to $2, the potential 50,000% increase highlights its explosive growth possibilities, driven by a solid roadmap, major exchange listings, and strong investor interest. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Analysts predict that the ARB token could reach $1.83 by the end of 2024, driven by the growing adoption of Ethereum’s Layer-2 solutions. Despite some short-term volatility, ARB is well-positioned for long-term growth. Cardano (ADA) has faced a tough fourth quarter, with its price dropping to around $0.87. Analysts forecast ADA might stabilize between $1.5 and $2.0 in January, 2025 with the potential to rise to $2.5 by second quarter of 2025 if it can regain key resistance levels. Upcoming developments, such as the Vasil hard fork, could boost ADA’s performance. Injective (INJ) continues to show strong performance, benefiting from its focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) and innovative applications. The token has experienced consistent growth and remains a key player in the DeFi space, with potential for further gains as the market expands. >>> Kaspa (KAS) is gaining recognition for its high transaction throughput, thanks to its unique block processing approach. This positions KAS as a strong contender for future growth, particularly during the next market bull run, as it offers fast and efficient transactions. Conclusion: BIG BOSS INU , Arbitrum, Cardano, Injective, and Kaspa each offer unique opportunities for exponential growth by 2025.

Pepe Rescues Trump (PEPERTRU), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPERTRU is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Rescues Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Rescues Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Rescues Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Rescues Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Rescues Trump by entering its contract address – HtgdKmNDff2UgXmmJYCryKhjVE2F89XMncNt8oThipHz – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPERTRU.

Table of Contents Rexas Finance: A rising star Why traders are moving away from Solana RXS’s value proposition The trader’s bold prediction Momentum building ahead of the next bull market How to buy RXS Looking ahead Conclusion Stories of exponential expansion define the crypto market, and each cycle introduces fresh competitors demanding attention. While Solana (SOL) has been popular among traders due to its fast speed and scalability, that trend is slowly shifting as investors look toward newer altcoins. A trader has identified Rexas Finance (RXS) as the next big thing, predicting tremendous growth that a $640 capital investment would grow to $64,000 in 64 days. You might also like: Solana nears breakdown with short build-up; Rexas Finance hits presale ATH Rexas Finance: A rising star Offering a strong platform that combines real-world asset tokenizing, a token builder for new businesses, and a launchpad to help developers, Rexas Finance is making waves in the blockchain ecosystem. Its emphasis on practicality and creativity distinguishes it in a market frequently overflowing with speculative assets. At just $0.175 in its 11th presale stage, RXS has raised $35.3 million and sold over $392.5 million in tokens, drawing interest from traders looking for notable profits. Although Solana already has a high market valuation and limited space for explosive expansion, Rexas Finance presents the ground-floor possibility that crypto aficionados dream about. Why traders are moving away from Solana In recent years, Solana has had various difficulties, including centralizing issues and network failures. Although it is still a strong participant in the blockchain scene, its explosive increase has lowered hopes for future profits. Many traders think Solana’s days of producing explosive returns reflect past events. Now, introduce Rexas Finance, a startup meant to fill the present blockchain scene. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, RXS offers a fresh emphasis on valuable applications and the security and scalability of Ethereum’s infrastructure. This combo ranks it among the best contenders for traders looking for the next significant altcoin. RXS’s value proposition Rexas Finance stands apart with elements meant for both developers and regular consumers. Its token builder and launchpad streamline token creation and distribution, enabling new initiatives to flourish. This ecosystem offers a strong basis for long-term development and promotes invention. The initiative’s dedication to openness makes it even more attractive.

Among the various tokens that have emerged, meme coins have captured the hearts and wallets of many. Initially seen as a joke, these coins have taken on a life of their own, often driving significant investment and community engagement. It’s fascinating to see how something that started as a meme can become a serious financial asset. But the real question is: how do you pick the best new meme coins to join for long term success? Over the years, meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have skyrocketed in popularity, creating waves of interest and investment opportunities. Now, we’re witnessing a new wave of meme coins that promise to take the charm and community spirit of these coins to the next level. Among the most promising players in this space are BTFD Coin, Mog Coin, and Apu Apustaja. Each brings unique features and community-driven initiatives that could make them standout choices for anyone looking to invest in the best new meme coins to join for long term growth. BTFD Coin, in particular, has shown an impressive presale performance, breaking the $4 million mark in just the first month. With exciting features like a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game and staking rewards, it’s not just about the memes anymore; it’s about tangible benefits and community engagement. Analysts are buzzing with predictions, and with the current presale stage hitting over $5.1 million, it’s clear that BTFD Coin is setting the bar high. Let’s dive deeper into what makes these coins the best new meme coins to join for long term investment. BTFD Coin’s Presale Golden Streak BTFD Coin, also known as $BTFD, has taken the meme coin world by storm, especially with its presale performance. As of January 9, 2025, it’s in its 13th stage, with a current price of $0.000142. This coin has already raised over $5.1 million and boasts over 8,100 holders. What’s more, they’ve sold more than 64 billion coins, which is no small feat. This is the kind of momentum you want to see when looking for the best new meme coins to join for long term success. But what sets BTFD apart? For starters, this isn’t just another meme coin; it’s backed by a robust community and innovative features. The team behind BTFD Coin is focusing on building a Play-to-Earn game that promises not just fun but real financial rewards for players. Imagine playing a game and earning tokens that you can then use or trade. That’s the allure here, and it’s something that could elevate BTFD Coin to the top of the meme coin hierarchy. Moreover, the referral program adds another layer of excitement. It incentivizes community members to spread the word, creating a viral loop of growth. Anyone who gets in early on this coin might find themselves in a position to reap serious rewards. Analysts are predicting that once the presale ends and the coin hits exchanges, the price could soar to new heights. If you invested $80,000 at the current price, you would acquire around 563 million $BTFD coins. When the price potentially reaches $0.0006 by the end of the presale, that investment could be worth a whopping $337,800. That’s the kind of upside that makes BTFD Coin one of the best new meme coins to join for long term. Mog Coin Raising Expectations Next on our list is Mog Coin, another rising star in the meme coin universe. While it might not have the same presale figures as BTFD, Mog Coin is carving out its niche and raising expectations among investors. Its unique selling proposition lies in its community governance model, which allows holders to influence key decisions about the project’s direction. This level of engagement is crucial when you’re searching for the best new meme coins to join for long term investment. Mog Coin has been gaining traction through its active community and creative marketing strategies. The team behind Mog is committed to transparency and open communication, which builds trust—a vital factor when considering any investment. With a focus on creating a strong brand identity, Mog Coin is positioning itself to be a contender in the meme coin race. One of the exciting features of Mog Coin is its staking rewards. Investors who hold their coins can earn additional tokens simply by being part of the community. This not only incentivizes long-term holding but also aligns with the trend of making passive income from cryptocurrency investments. Imagine waking up to find that your investment has grown while you slept. That’s the dream, right? And let’s not forget about the potential for meme culture to drive prices up. If Mog Coin can tap into the right trends and humor, it might just explode in popularity. With its community-driven approach and potential for adoption, Mog Coin is definitely one of the best new meme coins to join for long term. Apu Apustaja Out to Prove Itself Last but not least, we have Apu Apustaja, a meme coin that’s out to prove it’s more than just a passing fad. With a name derived from internet culture, this coin has harnessed the power of memes to build a community that’s both engaged and passionate. The driving force behind Apu Apustaja is its commitment to charity and social impact, which resonates well with younger investors looking for something more meaningful. Apu Apustaja is working on several community initiatives aimed at giving back, which can elevate its brand image and attract more investors. It’s not just about making a quick buck; it’s about creating a legacy. This approach can significantly enhance its appeal, making it one of the best new meme coins to join for long term success. The coin has also announced plans for a P2E game, similar to BTFD Coin, which adds another layer of excitement. Combining gaming with charity creates an attractive proposition.

Price Poised for 80% Rally,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/xrp-breakout-alert-price-poised-for-80-rally/,"The post XRP Breakout Alert! Price Poised for 80% Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP, the native token of Ripple Labs, is poised for significant upside momentum following the breakout of a bullish price action pattern on the daily timeframe. Over the past few days, the overall cryptocurrency market has been struggling, and during this period, XRP experienced a prolonged consolidation. XRP Price Prediction According to expert technical analysis, XRP has broken out of a bullish flag and pole price action pattern on the daily timeframe and has closed a daily candle above the pattern. This pattern breakout has ended XRP’s prolonged consolidation. Based on recent price action, there is a strong possibility that it could soar by 80% to reach the $4.5 level in the coming days. Source: Trading View This bullish pattern appears to be a textbook example, indicating an ideal buying opportunity for traders and investors looking for long-term holdings. On-Chain Metrics Signal Investor Confidence Besides the recent breakout, XRP investors have already shown strong interest and confidence in the token, even during periods of price struggles. Since December 18, 2024, exchanges have recorded token inflows on only three days, despite a notable price decline across the market, as revealed by Coinglass’s spot inflow/outflow metrics. Source: Coinglass $13 Million Worth of XRP Outflow from Exchanges However, in the past 24 hours, on-chain metrics indicate that investors have withdrawn a significant 13 million XRP tokens from exchanges, highlighting the continuous accumulation by long-term holders. This ongoing accumulation could strongly support XRP in its rally. Besides long-term holders, trader participation has also skyrocketed. Since the breakout, XRP’s open interest has jumped by 31%, indicating strong engagement from traders amid the market shift. Current Price Momentum Currently, XRP is trading near $2.54 and has experienced a price surge of over 8.75% in the past 24 hours.

This resistance level has proven a formidable barrier, with bearish pressure consistently preventing any meaningful breakout. Despite initial signs of a potential rebound, DOGE’s inability to surpass this key threshold suggests that bullish momentum remains fragile, leaving the meme coin in a precarious position. The rejection at the 4-hour SMA highlights the growing dominance of sellers in the market, casting doubt on whether buyers can regain control to push the price higher. A decisive move above the 4-hour SMA could signal a resurgence of positive sentiment, possibly paving the way for DOGE to target higher resistance levels. On the other hand, a continued failure to overcome this obstacle might lead to increased selling pressure, pushing the price toward lower support zones. Analyzing DOGE’s Recent Price Movement Analyzing Dogecoin’s recent price movement reveals a significant challenge for the bulls. Despite an initial rebound, DOGE has struggled to break through the resistance at the 4-hour SMA, which has become a critical barrier. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Dips: A Warning Sign or A Hidden Opportunity? This indicates that upward momentum has faltered, and the market sentiment may be shifting. The failure to surpass this key level could suggest that further gains are unlikely without a consolidation phase or additional bullish catalysts. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator provides additional confirmation of the current bearish trend as the RSI line continues to stay below the 50% threshold. The RSI is widely used to assess the market’s strength, and when it remains below 50%, it often signals that selling pressure is prevailing over buying activity. This aligns with the recent price action of DOGE as the asset struggles to break through the key resistance level at the 4-hour SMA. DOGE’s RSI’s failure to rise above the 50% mark implies that bearish forces persist, limiting the meme coin’s chances of sustaining a rally. As long as the RSI remains below 50%, downward pressure may continue, making it hard for Dogecoin to break resistance and potentially push the price toward lower support levels. A bullish reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50%, signaling a shift in market sentiment. For now, the bearish tone indicated by the RSI highlights the challenges DOGE faces in maintaining an upward trajectory. Critical Support And Resistance Levels To Watch For DOGE, key support and resistance levels offer vital insights into its future price movements. Dogecon’s price is currently testing the $0.3066 support level, which could act as a foundation if the bearish momentum persists. If DOGE falls below this support, it may head toward $0.2677, reflecting more downside risks. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Confirms Breakout: Analyst Sets New Price Targets On the upside, should Dogecoin make a positive turn and break above the 4-hour SMA, the immediate resistance to watch is $0.3563. Furthermore, a successful breach of this level might pave the way for further upward movement, with the next target being the $0.4 resistance zone.

38820428,https://crypto.news/?p=14326423,1736653324,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/38820428.jpeg,Heritage Distilling and 5 other companies embracing Bitcoin,https://crypto.news/heritage-distilling-plus-5-other-food-beverage-bitcoin/,"Heritage Distilling is just the latest company to integrate Bitcoin into their operations, either by accepting it as a payment method or by holding it as part of their corporate treasuries. The Gig Harbor, Washington-based craft spirits producer will implement Bitcoin ( BTC ) payments through its direct-to-consumer e-commerce platform. The move follows the creation of the company’s Technology and Cryptocurrency Committee, led by digital payments expert Matt Swann. Heritage’s policy highlighted Bitcoin’s growing adoption among consumers, financial institutions, and policymakers. The company points to the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s 2023 policy change, which allows public companies to mark Bitcoin to fair value as an asset, making it more practical for corporate treasury management. The company also shares a different approach to managing Bitcoin price volatility, insisting that it offers protection that traditional Bitcoin investors lack when purchasing with fiat currency. As a consumer product manufacturer, Heritage notes that its production margins provide a buffer against Bitcoin price fluctuations. “As a company producing goods for sale, acceptable margins between the retail price of our products and their cost of production are expected to offset potential fluctuations in the value of bitcoin we accept as payment,” CEO Justin Stiefel said Jan. 10 in a prepared statement. You might also like: Nasdaq-listed Heritage Distilling introduces Bitcoin treasury plans Swann, who chairs the company’s Technology and Cryptocurrency Committee, will develop a formal Bitcoin Treasury Policy for board approval. “The growth of bitcoin is still in its early stages, and the opportunity for companies to accept bitcoin as payment is substantial,” he added. The policy builds on recent developments in corporate Bitcoin adoption (i.e. MicroStrategy ), as companies are adopting cryptocurrency for Treasury management and/or payment options. Here are several other notable examples in the food/beverage space: Table of Contents Steakholder Foods Beck & Bulow Chipotle Whole Foods Starbucks Honorable Mentions You might also like: 10 companies launch Bitcoin treasuries, but not Microsoft: Here are the risks, benefits Steakholder Foods Steakholder Foods Ltd., a company specializing in alternative protein production, announced in November that its board has approved the purchase of up to $1 million in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency tracking indices. CEO Arik Kaufman explained the decision, citing the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies. “As demand for cryptocurrencies grows and their acceptance as an asset class increases, we believe Bitcoin, or a mix of cryptocurrencies, will be strong treasury reserve assets for the company,” he said. Kaufman also pointed to recent developments like cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and institutional investor interest as reasons for the move. “Cryptocurrencies could add value to our treasury strategy and act as a store of value,” he said. Based in Rehovot, Israel, Steakholder Foods focuses on sustainable food technology. The decision to invest in cryptocurrency reflects the company’s interest in new financial strategies beyond its core business. Beck & Bulow Beck & Bulow, a Santa Fe-based meat and seafood company, announced last April that it would start accepting Bitcoin as a payment method, both online and in-store. The move, described by the company as an “innovative step,” aims to enhance payment flexibility and promote financial independence for customers and employees. Through an integration with IBEX, a third-party payment processor, customers can now purchase Beck & Bulow’s products using Bitcoin. But the company didn’t stop there. It also revealed plans to convert 20% of its assets into Bitcoin, citing the cryptocurrency’s potential as a reliable store of value. “We will also retain all Bitcoin payments received, reinforcing our confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential,” the company said in a statement. Beck & Bulow’s commitment to Bitcoin extends beyond payments and treasury. The company pledged to incorporate Bitcoin into its employee 401(k) program, offering staff a way to invest in the digital asset as part of their retirement planning. This bold move places Beck & Bulow among a growing number of businesses adopting Bitcoin, not just as a payment method but also as a core component of their financial strategies. The company’s decision reflects confidence in the cryptocurrency’s role in fostering financial innovation and resilience. Chipotle Chipotle Mexican Grill is especially bullish on Bitcoin and digital currencies as part of its strategy to innovate and engage tech-savvy customers. The fast-casual restaurant chain accepts Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for in-store payments through Flexa, a digital payments platform. Customers can use Flexa-enabled apps like Gemini or SPEDN to make cryptocurrency payments seamlessly. Chipotle has also leveraged cryptocurrency in its marketing campaigns, creating unique promotions to attract attention and reward customers. In April 2021, the company celebrated National Burrito Day by giving away $100,000 in Bitcoin. Participants guessed a six-digit passcode on a microsite for a chance to win. In July 2022, Chipotle ran another crypto-themed campaign, awarding over $200,000 in digital currencies through an interactive game. Of this, $35,000 in Bitcoin was split among six lucky winners. Chipotle’s digital innovation extends beyond cryptocurrencies. The company launched “Burrito Bucks,” its in-game currency on the Roblox platform, allowing players to exchange their Burrito Bucks for free entrée codes redeemable at participating Chipotle locations. Whole Foods Whole Foods currently accepts Bitcoin payments through third-party applications, allowing customers to purchase groceries using cryptocurrency. While the supermarket franchise doesn’t hold its own crypto treasury, its parent company is reportedly considering it. Recall how Amazon.com Inc. acquired Whole Foods in 2017, in a deal valued at $13.7 billion. The acquisition was a landmark move at the time, marking Amazon’s entry into the brick-and-mortar grocery business. And last month, a group of Amazon shareholders — led by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) — has proposed that the Seattle-based company allocate at least 5% of its assets to Bitcoin. The measure is currently set for review ahead of Amazon’s 2025 annual meeting, according to Guru Focus. Amazon’s board has yet to respond to the proposal. This push follows a similar effort by the NCPPR to encourage Microsoft to adopt Bitcoin, which was ultimately rejected by its shareholders. Starbucks In 2018, there was some confusion regarding Starbucks’ stance on accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. The company later clarified that it didn’t accept any form of crypto as a payment option. But that has since changed. The Seattle-based coffee giant now accepts Bitcoin payments via Flexa’s SPEDN app. This enables customers to pay for their drink and food orders using cryptocurrency. So far, there is no indication that Starbucks plans to build a Bitcoin treasury. The company’s focus appears to be on providing customers with diverse payment options rather than using cryptocurrency as a reserve asset, aligning with its strategy of convenience and innovation. While the adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury asset is still emerging in the food and beverage industry, these examples highlight a growing trend of integrating cryptocurrency into various aspects of business operations. Honorable Mentions Pizza Hut : In Venezuela, the casual dining franchise began accepting Bitcoin for payments due to the country’s economic challenges, though there are no reports of Bitcoin being held as part of its treasury. Restaurant Brands International : The Burger King parent company has begun accepting Bitcoin for payments in specific markets, including Germany and Venezuela. It remains to be seen whether the so-called “home of the Whopper” discloses crypto treasury holdings. Sheetz : The convenience store chain has begun accepting digital currencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, at all its locations. This move caters to the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies among consumers.

However, a new token called Rollblock makes the top 5 list of coins to consider in 2025 after a presale raise of over $8.5 million. Let’s check out our top 5 coins for 2025 and why they could be worthwhile investments. 1. Rollblock (RBLK) Rollblock is the newest kid on the block, but it has already established itself as one of the top cryptos to buy. The Rollblock project features a blockchain-based casino that eliminates conventional issues like rigged games and unfair house edge. It also features DeFi features like staking, with up to 30% APY for investors. There’s also a revenue-sharing program that rewards players and investors with a chunk of the casino’s weekly profits. So, both the operator and users get to benefit from the casino’s operations. The Rollblock RBLK token presale is currently in stage 9, trading for $0.045. 2. Solana (SOL) Solana is fast becoming the top choice for developers, especially those building dApps. As a result, the SOL token is predicted to reach new highs in the coming months. This will be fueled by DeFi projects gaining more traction. Consequently, SOL went up to $222 in early January, but the SOL price is now down to around $185. 3. Cardano (ADA) The ADA blockchain is famous for its altcoin. However, its use cases include supporting dApps to solve different blockchain-related problems. The ADA network’s DeFi features, including staking, are also attractive to investors. These features are powered by the ADA token. The ADA price is currently around $0.92, down by over 13% in the past week. However, analysts remain optimistic about a massive breakout in the near future. 4. XRP XRP is notable for its global payment network, which businesses leverage and developers use to exchange cryptocurrencies. The XRP token powers the ecosystem, and it has started 2025 on a high. In the past week, XRP has surged to $2.35 from its $2.25 price at the start of the year. The increase in the XRP price is a result of its increased demand following various strategic partnerships and network upgrades. However, there’s still a massive demand required for the XRP price to reach its all-time high value of $3.40 this year. 5. Shiba Inu (SHIB) SHIB is another crypto that started the year strong and can be a decent addition to any portfolio based on its recent performance. The meme coin has surged by over 100% in the past year, and its initial run to $0.000025 in early January indicates more potential gains. Though the Shiba Inu price is now down by over 9% in the past week, some investors are packing it up. That means they consider the current Shiba Inu price of $0.000022 to be a bargain ahead of its potential jump. Conclusion XRP, ADA, SHIB, RBLK, and SOL are the altcoins to consider in 2025. However, at its current low price, RBLK is better positioned for a massive jump. Interested investors can purchase the casino token for $0.045 before it increases to $0.052 in the next stage.

This movement is driven by increased liquidity and a rise in trading volumes. At the same time, the Injective (INJ) rally is picking up pace, with optimistic signs hinting at new peaks, despite the cautious stance from futures traders. Meanwhile, Web3Bay (3BAY) is incorporating web3 into e-commerce, completely rethinking online trade. With over $580,000 collected and 160 million tokens sold, Web3Bay’s decentralized method promises a safe, open, and cost-saving shopping experience. Poised to pioneer the next wave of online commerce, Web3Bay aims to take a substantial portion of Amazon’s market share. Filecoin Price Prediction: Reaching $30 After Multi-Year Formation? The Filecoin price prediction has become more compelling as FIL exits a longstanding symmetrical triangle, hinting at a shift to bullish trends. Recently, Filecoin has experienced a 30% increase, with experts setting a $30 target for the near future. A major element fueling this positive outlook for Filecoin includes the introduction of the FIL/KRW trading pair on South Korea’s Bithumb exchange, improving both liquidity and access. Additionally, a growing Total Value Locked (TVL) of $91.12 million and robust open interest are supporting Filecoin’s potential for sustained growth. Injective Rally Signals Hope for Reaching $30 The Injective (INJ) rally has captured the interest of traders, with the token rising 33% in value recently before stabilizing. Currently priced at $21.26, INJ displays bullish signals like an RSI of 58.88 and a positive MACD crossover, pointing to further gains. The community-backed shift to Injective 3.0, which reduces INJ’s supply, is propelling its upward trajectory. Although futures traders are still cautious, as shown by a Long/Short Ratio under 1, analysts believe the ongoing Injective rally might cause a short squeeze, potentially pushing prices above $28.72. If the momentum continues, INJ could break past $30 and may even reach $35.26, marking a significant achievement for the asset. Web3Bay Poised to Transform Traditional E-commerce! Web3Bay is set to revolutionize the e-commerce industry by blending blockchain technology with features that prioritize user security and cost-effectiveness. The platform’s presale has amassed over $580,000 with 160 million tokens sold. Aiming to change how users purchase, trade, and sell digital goods, Web3Bay is quickly becoming a decentralized e-commerce force, set to capture a large market share. But the big question remains: Should traditional platforms like Amazon be worried? While traditional e-commerce platforms have established the foundation for online shopping, Web3Bay introduces solutions that tackle key industry issues, like high fees and central middlemen, ensuring secure, transparent, and affordable transactions. Moreover, by integrating web3 into e-commerce, Web3Bay demonstrates its commitment to global access, enabling transactions without centralized control. Web3Bay’s vision extends beyond basic e-commerce offerings, planning an NFT marketplace and partnerships with DeFi platforms for staking, lending, and borrowing services. This expansive ecosystem underlines Web3Bay’s forward-looking approach, appealing to both traders and consumers. Currently, at just $0.0039675 per token in presale stage 3, the 3BAY token is projected to jump to $0.1959 at launch, presenting a potential 6,430% ROI. As Web3Bay’s presale figures near the million-dollar mark, its platform signifies a decisive move towards decentralized, secure, and efficient digital commerce. In essence, Web3Bay’s progress leaves no doubt: Amazon and other traditional e-commerce platforms have every reason to be concerned. Summing Up! The cryptocurrency landscape is evolving with promising opportunities across different sectors. The Filecoin price prediction highlights a bullish scenario, aiming for $30 following its breakout from a multi-year symmetrical triangle. Similarly, the Injective rally shows potential for significant gains, supported by community-led reductions in token supply and positive technical indicators. On the other hand, Web3Bay is setting itself up to challenge Amazon’s dominance in e-commerce, seeking a major market share . By integrating web3 into e-commerce, Web3Bay provides a new way of secure and cost-effective transactions. With over $580,000 raised, Web3Bay is not just transforming e-commerce but also offering a decentralized alternative to conventional giants.

The “Banana Zone,” coined by Pal, refers to periods of significant upward price movement. “Yes, we are still in the Banana Zone,” Pal said on X on Jan. 10, adding that the first phase of this bull market began with a breakout in November last year. This phase was followed by consolidation, similar to the 2016–2017 cycle, which Pal noted “won’t last long.” Pal predicted the next stage, the “Banana Singularity,” as an altcoin season “when everything goes up, followed by a bigger consolidation.” Altcoin seasons typically follow declines in Bitcoin (BTC) dominance, which currently remains high at 58%, per TradingView. DeFi researcher 0xNobler appeared to agree with Pal, writing on X that “Bitcoin just entered the acceleration phase” and forecasting a dramatic rise to $500,000, which could “ignite the biggest altseason in history.” Futures trader CoinMamba, however, offered a more skeptical take, saying, “This sell-off is so bad that we will have an altseason just by prices going back to what it was one week ago.” Pal described the third and final phase of the Banana Zone as the “concentration phase,” where “core winners explode on to make much higher highs.” Despite recent corrections, crypto markets have risen 90% year-over-year in total market capitalization, growing from $1.8 trillion to $3.4 trillion after most of 2024 was spent consolidating. Total market capitalization reached an all-time high of $3.9 trillion on Dec. 17, marking a 27% increase over the previous cycle’s peak.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 04:02:00

He highlighted the government’s stance on fostering technological progress, stating, “We want technology to evolve.” Mnuchin further addressed the regulatory approach, stressing that it was designed to ensure a “level playing field,” where financial services provided by traditional banks, fintech companies, or digital payment systems, are subject to the same standards. XRP’s Role in Leveling the Playing Field The video resurfaced in crypto discussions after Linda P. Jones, a prominent Wall Street veteran and crypto enthusiast, interpreted Mnuchin’s comments as aligning with Ripple’s XRP Ledger (XRPL). The XRPL’s native cryptocurrency, XRP, has long been touted as a solution for cross-border payments, offering cost-effective and efficient alternatives to legacy systems. Jones argued that XRP had been integral to the broader financial innovation plan, asserting, “Understand the XRP ledger is a public good, and all countries will be using it.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Mnuchin’s remarks provide a foundation for understanding the evolving regulatory landscape. Jones noted that Mnuchin acknowledged the benefits of distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), and underscored the need for oversight to prevent misuse. The focus on maintaining fairness across financial providers resonates with Ripple’s vision for the XRPL. Designed as an open, decentralized platform, the ledger enables real-time cross-border transactions while supporting interoperability between financial institutions. The Ledger also allows anyone to use it for various purposes. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Stuart Alderoty highlighted this decentralization in 2024 when there was speculation that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has been embroiled in a legal battle with Ripple for multiple years, was operating a node on the XRPL. A New Era for the Crypto Market Ripple has consistently positioned itself as a collaborator with regulators, advocating for transparent and equitable standards. Given the timing, Mnuchin’s acknowledgment of distributed ledger technology and his emphasis on a fair regulatory framework hold particular significance. In 2020, the crypto space faced increased scrutiny. This intensified in the following years with Gary Gensler and the Biden administration. However, things are changing, as Gensler resigns on January 20, the day of Trump’s inauguration. The XRP army is already celebrating Trump’s return to office. The freedom his administration will give the crypto space could help digital assets like XRP reach their full potential and help level the global financial playing field.

Elon Buys Solana (ELONBSOL), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Buys Solana launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 85b1Mza2zF6SDGXZURjeu53wdapN6W1UjFC4PAqhKE8k – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 04:25:00

While Bitcoin continues to lead the market, these altcoins are offering thrilling potential for exceptional gains. From the dependable Ethereum (ETH) to the rapidly emerging BIG BOSS INU, these digital assets are poised for significant growth. With a bull run anticipated, these top picks are positioned for strong performance in the coming months, attracting attention from savvy investors. Crypto Watch: BIG BOSS INU’s Presale Sparks Major Interest BIG BOSS INU is rapidly emerging as a key player in the crypto space, with its presale drawing strong investor interest. Seen as a high-reward opportunity, early backers are eager to jump in. The growing enthusiasm makes BIG BOSS INU a must-watch cryptocurrency this November. With its cutting-edge approach and bold development plans, BIG BOSS INU is poised for significant growth in the months ahead. >>>>>> Cardano (ADA) is gaining renewed investor attention following the Chang hard fork, which introduced on-chain governance to the network. ADA has been steadily growing, currently trading around $0.8, and is projected to reach $1 in the coming months due to its strong fundamentals in the DeFi space. Polygon (MATIC) continues to lead as a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, providing faster and more cost-effective transactions. With ongoing partnerships and its role in scaling Ethereum’s infrastructure, MATIC remains a strong contender for long-term growth, especially as DeFi and NFTs expand. Kaspa (KAS) has seen impressive growth, recently surging 36% following a major exchange listing. Known for its high transaction speeds through its GHOSTDAG technology, Kaspa is positioning itself as a key player in the blockchain space, especially for those seeking fast and efficient transactions. >>> TRON (TRX) is making significant gains in the DeFi and dApp sectors, with its price nearing its 2017 all-time high. TRX’s low transaction costs and high speeds make it an attractive option for developers, and analysts believe it could reach $2 by the first quarter of 2025, driven by increasing adoption. Conclusion As the crypto market prepares for another rally, investing in altcoins like BIG BOSS INU , Cardano, Polygon, Kaspa, and TRON offers a unique opportunity for significant growth. BIG BOSS INU’s presale has captured major investor interest, while Cardano’s advancements in DeFi, Polygon’s leadership in Ethereum scaling, Kaspa’s fast transactions, and TRON’s adoption in the DeFi space all indicate strong potential for explosive returns.

As the tokens gained new traction, their performance increased, increasing their demand even further. Let’s analyze the Fartcoin Vs Pippin price performance and where investors should invest in before January ends. Fartcoin Vs Pippin: Analyzing Their Price Performance Since its launch in October 2024, Fartcoin’s price has grown by 1580754.15%, showing an impressive performance on the chart. Although the meme coin had a slow start, it hit its prime at the beginning of January 2025, creating an ATH of $1.60 regardless of the market’s declining conditions. However, it currently traded at only $0.7913 after a 50% drop from the peak with $791M in market capitalization. There’s a significant drop in demand as the 24-hour trading volume has declined 40% to $98.81M. This is the result of the continuous downtrend, reducing the buyer’s activity as investors flock to utility-based tokens amid a consolidating market. On the other hand, Pippin is in its price right now, creating an ATH of $0.3269 just a few hours ago with increasing investor interest. According to Coingecko data , the Pippin price has surged 1453% in the last week and 3692% over the week, currently trading at $0.226. It also has $252M in market capitalization and $134M in trading volume, indicating a high demand for the token in the market. However, it could face consolidation next, with the RSI presenting overbuying zone. Where To Investment Before January Ends? Both meme coins have witnessed new highs in the last few days. One trader made $2.5M with Pippin , whereas many earned with the other. Interestingly, with a similar total supply and market background, Fartcoin is ahead in overall performance, but investors’ bullish sentiments are higher for Pippin per CoinmarketCap’s community sentiments. Considering the rising demand for AI cryptos and the market favoring AI in the cryptocurrency trend 2025 , Pippins gets ahead in the Fartcoin vs. Pippin battle for the short-term objective. However, Fartcoin is not much behind and presents a potential for trend reversal and recovery. A strategic trade with deep research and analysis could make significant returns for investors in both meme coins. What To Remember From This Fartcoin Vs Pippin Analysis? 2025 has favored two less-known cryptocurrencies, Fartcoin and Pippin, as their demand has grown in the last few days. The former achieved a peak at the beginning of the month and is in a downtrend today, but the other achieved a peak a few hours ago. However, consolidation could follow as the technical indicators indicate overbuying. Overall, both tokens show profit potential for January. This is not a Pippin price prediction or investment advice but an analysis of current performance. Investors should do their own research and technical analysis before investing in any cryptocurrency, as a market trend and community sentiments fluctuate often, leading to price fluctuations.

While the general market sentiment remains bullish, recent developments in the US economy indicate that macroeconomic factors may be against the premier cryptocurrency in 2025. Currently, Bitcoin trades above $94,000 following another turbulent price performance which produced a loss of 3.45% in the past seven days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Mixed Signals: Institutional Investors Accumulate Amid Retail Weakness Fed’s Pivot To Rate Cuts Is Dead – Analysts In an X post on December 10, market experts at global capital market analysis firm The Kobeissi Letter dissected the employment situation summary for December 2024. According to the BLS, nonfarm payrolls employment rose by 256,000 jobs in this month, indicating an additional 100,000 jobs to the widely predicted figures. Following this report, The Kobeissi Letter analysts highlight that the US economy has gained an average of 165,000 jobs since July representing the highest 6-month average since July 2024. Considering the US Federal Reserve began implementing interest rate cuts from September 2024 citing then a reduction in jobs growth and inflation, the analysts at The Kobeissi Letter stated the Apex Bank’s approach may have been misguided in light of the recent developments. Therefore, the Fed is expected to halt interest rate cuts to battle an expected heightened inflation due to a strong jobs data, with the potential of even adopting rate hikes. Generally, an absence of rate cuts or introduction of rate hikes is negative for Bitcoin as lower Interest rates afford investors the capacity to deal In risky assets such as cryptocurrencies. Following the Fed’s previous announcement of potential reduced rate cuts in 2025, Bitcoin experienced a flash crash of over 9% mid-December as investors moved to close their volatile positions in all financial markets. Currently, The Kobeissi Letter forecasts that the Fed’s pivot to rate cuts is likely over, with a 44% probability that there will be no rate cuts through June 2025.

Meanwhile, the premier cryptocurrency is down by 3.72% and 6.35% in the past seven and thirty days respectively. Despite the potential of reduced rate cuts in 2025, Bitcoin investors are likely to retain bullish sentiments due to other factors including historical price performance in a bull cycle, an expected pro-crypto US government and continuous institutional investments via the spot ETFs. With a market cap of $1.84 trillion, Bitcoin continues to rank as the largest cryptocurrency and world’s eight largest asset.

Judge Phyllis Hamilton’s order establishes clear boundaries for what information can be sealed from public view in the ongoing litigation. Legal Documents Get New Privacy Guidelines This latest ruling addresses specific exhibits tied to Ripple’s summary judgment motion. The court approved limited redactions of sensitive business data and personal information while maintaining broad public access to the core legal proceedings. The sealed documents include eight documents submitted by Ripple and 56 exhibits referenced by the plaintiffs. The court also accepted additional redactions sought by the plaintiffs to protect information linked to Ripple’s efforts to exclude certain expert testimony. The court based its decision on the “compelling reasons” standard outlined by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Under this standard, parties must demonstrate that the need for confidentiality outweighs the public’s interest in accessing court records. Judge Hamilton concluded that the proposed redactions were appropriately limited and satisfied legal requirements, ensuring sensitive business and personal information were protected. The decision follows an earlier directive requiring both parties to narrow their initial sealing requests . The SEC secured permission to protect portions of four exhibits containing confidential information. These include three documents supporting Ripple’s summary judgment motion and one related to expert witness testimony.

The regulatory body’s next filing could signal its strategic direction. This filing is even more notable because the SEC leadership is about to experience a major shake-up. Gary Gensler, the Chair of the regulatory agency, will resign on January 20. After years of holding back the crypto market, the news of Gensler’s departure was celebrated in the crypto industry. Many in the community believe Paul Atkins, the pro-crypto candidate picked by President-elect Donald Trump, will end the lawsuit against Ripple. However, the SEC has until January 15 to file its appeal brief or the lawsuit will be dismissed , so Gensler’s administration might still submit this brief. Despite this, the consensus is that the lawsuit will be dropped. Many in the community see Trump’s return to office as a game-changer for the crypto world, and it will be intriguing to see how the new SEC leadership handles the legal dispute with Ripple.

This time, the group has Meta Platforms Inc. in its crosshairs. Ethan Peck, a National Center employee, submitted a Bitcoin Treasury Shareholder Proposal to Meta on behalf of his family, marking yet another attempt to bring the cryptocurrency to the boardrooms of tech giants. Tim Jotzman, a Bitcoin ( BTC ) podcast host, shared the proposal on Jan. 10 via a social media post. See below. A #Bitcoin Treasury Shareholder Proposal has been submitted to Meta. The shareholder, Ethan Peck, who is an employee at The National Center for Public Policy Research – the organization that submitted to $MSFT & $AMZN – informed me he submitted on behalf of his family’s shares. pic.twitter.com/KrAKw7nHwp — Tim Kotzman (@TimKotzman) January 10, 2025 Will corporate treasuries turn into crypto strongholds? Based in Washington, D.C., the NCPPR has been touting Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic turbulence. They’ve already approached Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. with similar pitches. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft nixed the idea, but Seattle-based Amazon will reportedly consider it at an April meeting of its shareholders. NCPPR seems to be taking a page out of Michael Saylor’s playbook. Saylor, as former CEO and current chair of MicroStrategy, crafted a Bitcoin-heavy corporate strategy and has emerged as a poster child for corporate treasuries filled with crypto. If NCPPR gets its way, Meta and Amazon, like MicroStrategy, will allocate a portion of their respective assets to Bitcoin. Why? They see it as an alternative to lackluster corporate bonds due to its fixed supply. Also, Bitcoin ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, spiked 100% by the end of 2024. That’s quadruple the returns of the S&P 500 index and 35% higher than the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which tracks the magnificent seven tech giants (of which Meta, Microsoft and Amazon are members). And then there’s MicroStrategy, which saw its stock balloon 2,191% over five years. You might also like: Heritage Distilling and 5 other companies embracing Bitcoin Remember Libra? No? Good. Meta attempted to launch its own digital currency, Libra, in 2019 when the company was known as Facebook. The project aimed to create a global stablecoin backed by a basket of fiat currencies and government securities. Libra was intended to facilitate low-cost, seamless transactions worldwide, particularly for the unbanked population. However, the initiative faced significant regulatory pushback from lawmakers and financial authorities globally, who raised concerns about monetary sovereignty, data privacy, and potential misuse for illicit activities. The project rebranded as Diem in 2020, focusing solely on U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins. Meta courted Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal to be partners, but they withdrew support. By early 2022, Meta sold Diem to Silvergate Bank for around $200 million. While the Libra/Diem initiative was a bust, it demonstrated Meta’s ambition in the digital currency space. Whether Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his board take the NCPPR’s bait and make Bitcoin their next big move, remains to be seen.

While Bitcoin remains a dominant force, these altcoins are offering massive growth potential. From the well-established Ethereum (ETH) to the rising star BigBossInu, these digital assets are on track for extraordinary gains. Investors are closely watching these top picks as they are primed to surge ahead of the market rally, making them some of the most promising opportunities in the space. BigBossInu: Revolutionizing Crypto with Its Explosive Presale BIG BOSS INU is rapidly shaking up the crypto market, with its presale igniting strong demand from investors. This opportunity promises massive rewards for early backers. As anticipation builds, BigBossInu is one of the hottest cryptos to track this November. Armed with cutting-edge features and an ambitious roadmap, BIG BOSS INU is set to deliver game-changing growth in the months to come. >>>>>> XRP is currently trading around $2.2, buoyed by recent optimism surrounding potential ETF news and its ongoing legal battles with the SEC. Analysts suggest that if the legal outlook remains favorable, XRP could push toward $5 in the coming weeks. However, any negative developments could see the price drop back to support at $2.0. Dogecoin (DOGE) is hovering near $0.38 after a recent attempt to break above the $0.5 resistance level. Sellers have dominated the last few sessions, preventing DOGE from holding gains above this level. Buyers will need to defend current support levels to prevent a drop back toward $0.20. Sei (SEI) has experienced substantial growth over the last 30 days, rising by 43% and currently trading at $0.45. However, analysts warn of a potential pullback due to overbought conditions, with the price possibly dropping to $0.30 before a rebound that could drive SEI higher​. >>> Polkadot (DOT) is struggling to hold above the $8.50 resistance level, with recent declines pushing it down to around $6.5. Buyers have lost momentum, and if DOT fails to stay above critical support levels, it could face further declines. Final Thought As Bitcoin nears the $150K mark, cryptos like BIG BOSS INU, XRP, Dogecoin, and Polkadot show strong potential for growth. BIG BOSS INU’s presale, XRP’s legal optimism, Dogecoin’s resistance battle, and Polkadot’s support levels highlight their promise for significant returns.

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS.

Impact on Trend A move below the STH cost-basis could shift the bullish trend into a neutral or bearish phase , marking a turning point in market dynamics. Factors That Could Drive a Reversal 1. Profit-Taking by Investors Recent gains have led to increased profit-taking , which may push prices lower. 2. Broader Market Volatility External factors such as macroeconomic uncertainties or regulatory developments could contribute to downward pressure. 3. Declining Momentum Weakening trading volumes and reduced buying pressure may exacerbate a potential decline. Historical Precedents of STH Cost-Basis Breaches Date STH Cost-Basis Breach Market Reaction January 2022 Fell below key level Bearish trend ensued March 2023 Stabilized above key level Bullish rally followed August 2024 Briefly breached Sideways consolidation Historical data highlights the importance of this metric in signaling potential market shifts.

This article explores Woo’s insights, the underlying market dynamics, and what it means for Bitcoin investors. The Current Market Sentiment 1. Bullish Sentiment Prevails Bitcoin’s price momentum has fueled optimism, attracting both retail and institutional interest. Many investors view this as the beginning of a prolonged upward trend. 2. Signs of Profit-Taking Woo noted that profit-taking is becoming increasingly common, with more investors selling their holdings as prices climb.

Potential Correction A market correction could serve as a reset, providing an opportunity for new buyers to enter at lower price points. 3. Impact on Sentiment Overextended bullish sentiment could shift to caution or fear if corrections are significant. Strategies for Bitcoin Investors 1. Avoid Overleveraging Investors should refrain from using excessive leverage, as heightened volatility increases liquidation risks. 2.

Monitor Key Indicators Keep an eye on on-chain metrics, such as realized profits and market sentiment, to anticipate potential market shifts. 4.

Support and Resistance Levels Key support levels, such as $90,000 , and resistance levels, such as $100,000 , will play a pivotal role in shaping price movements. 3. Institutional Activity Institutional behavior often influences market sentiment; increased selling from large players could amplify corrections. FAQs 1. Why is Willy Woo urging caution for Bitcoin investors? Woo highlighted that market risk is peaking, with increased profit-taking indicating a potential short-term correction. 2. What does peaking risk mean for Bitcoin’s price? Peaking risk suggests heightened volatility and the possibility of a market reset before resuming upward momentum. 3. Should I sell my Bitcoin holdings now? Investors should assess their financial goals and market conditions; long-term holders may choose to ride out short-term volatility. 4. What are the key support levels for Bitcoin? Current support levels include $90,000 , with resistance at $100,000 . 5. How can investors manage risk in a volatile market?

Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz recently shared an example of a phishing email designed to impersonate Coinbase. The fraudulent email attempts to deceive recipients into updating their account details via a malicious link, potentially compromising their sensitive information. Scam Warning: If you see an email that looks like this, it's a scam. pic.twitter.com/klneRy7dor — David ""JoelKatz"" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 11, 2025 Increasing Scam Attempts in 2025 Scam campaigns have plagued the cryptocurrency space for years, with scammers exploiting unsuspecting users by imitating trusted platforms. This warning from Schwartz follows other scam attempts reported in late 2024, indicating that malicious actors ramp up their efforts as the new year begins. The broader crypto community has shown appreciation for figures like Schwartz, who regularly alert users to such dangers. One community member, BankXRP (@BankXRP), stated , “It’s really great that you do this David along with some of the other large X accounts to help protect the community.” Ripple has historically taken a strong stance against scams. In early 2024, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse publicly criticized platforms such as X and YouTube for allowing scam-related content to proliferate, as both platforms hosted XRP scams as ads. While these platforms have made efforts to address the issue, scammers continue to find ways to bypass detection mechanisms. XRP Community Response to Schwartz’s Warning Community members have also shared advice on how to avoid falling victim to scams. One user emphasized the importance of exercising caution with email links, saying , “I make it a practice to never use links sent in emails unless I’ve just requested it.” He noted that this practice helps avoid scam emails, as scammers are becoming increasingly sophisticated and it is harder to tell them apart from real emails. Others echoed similar sentiments, urging users to verify communication authenticity directly through official channels. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 How To Stay Safe The phishing email shared by Schwartz reflects a common tactic in these scams. It mimics the branding and tone of legitimate companies, creating a false sense of urgency to manipulate recipients into acting hastily. The email claims that users need to update their account details, directing them to click on a link that likely leads to a malicious website. Experts recommend several precautions to safeguard against phishing and other fraudulent schemes. First, users should never click on unsolicited links or attachments in emails, even if the sender appears legitimate. Instead, they should navigate to the official website by manually entering the URL into their browser. Second, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on accounts adds additional security. The scam attempts have become more frequent since the start of the new year, and as scams become increasingly sophisticated, community awareness remains a crucial defense.

In a recent blog post, Butterfill suggested that establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States could yield a more profound impact on Bitcoin adoption than the highly anticipated Bitcoin ETFs launched last year. Butterfill argues that this legislation could alleviate lingering skepticism around institutional Bitcoin investments, setting a precedent for other governments and significantly boosting Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Understanding the U.S. Bitcoin Act 1. What Is the Bitcoin Act? The Bitcoin Act proposes the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States, positioning Bitcoin as a national asset similar to gold. 2. Goals of the Act Legitimizing Bitcoin : Enhance Bitcoin’s status as a credible institutional asset. Encouraging Adoption : Incentivize other governments to explore similar strategies. Strengthening U.S. Financial Leadership : Establish the U.S. as a global leader in cryptocurrency adoption and innovation. How the Bitcoin Act Could Impact Institutions 1. Overcoming Negative Perceptions Institutional investors often face scrutiny over cryptocurrency investments due to regulatory uncertainty and market volatility. By establishing a strategic reserve, the Bitcoin Act could lend credibility to Bitcoin as a reliable asset class, reducing hesitations among major investors. 2. Increasing Institutional Flow Butterfill predicts that the Act could trigger a substantial influx of institutional capital , surpassing the impact of Bitcoin ETFs. Institutions like pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and insurance companies could be more inclined to add Bitcoin to their portfolios. 3. Global Ripple Effect If the U.S. leads by example, other governments may follow suit, creating a domino effect that accelerates Bitcoin’s adoption worldwide. Comparison: Bitcoin ETFs vs. the Bitcoin Act Aspect Bitcoin ETFs Bitcoin Act Adoption Catalyst Simplifies access for retail investors Targets large-scale institutional adoption Impact Horizon Short to medium term Long term Credibility Boost Moderate High, due to government endorsement Scope Limited to financial products National and global financial ecosystems Why the Bitcoin Act Matters More Than ETFs 1. Greater Institutional Confidence Government backing reduces perceived risks, encouraging institutions to invest larger sums. 2. Broader Adoption Beyond ETFs While ETFs primarily attract retail investors, the Bitcoin Act appeals to institutional and governmental players, amplifying Bitcoin’s reach. 3. Stability for Bitcoin Establishing a national reserve would reduce Bitcoin’s perceived volatility, making it more attractive to long-term investors. CoinShares’ Perspective on the Bitcoin Act According to Butterfill, the Bitcoin Act could fundamentally reshape the global perception of Bitcoin by: Aligning Bitcoin with traditional strategic assets like gold. Encouraging broader financial system integration. Highlighting the utility of Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat currency risks. What Would Adoption Look Like? 1. U.S. Reserve Implementation The U.S. government could allocate a portion of its treasury holdings to Bitcoin, signaling its importance as a strategic asset. 2. Institutional Buy-In Institutions would likely follow the government’s lead, viewing Bitcoin as a credible and necessary diversification tool. 3. International Adoption Countries like Switzerland and Singapore, already friendly toward crypto, could adopt similar measures, accelerating global Bitcoin adoption. Potential Challenges 1. Regulatory Pushback Critics may argue that allocating government resources to Bitcoin is risky due to its volatility. 2. Market Volatility While the Bitcoin Act could stabilize Bitcoin over time, initial market reactions might be unpredictable. 3. Political Resistance Gaining bipartisan support for such an initiative could be challenging, delaying its implementation. FAQs 1. What is the U.S. Bitcoin Act? The Bitcoin Act is a proposed legislation to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the U.S., positioning it as a national asset. 2. How does the Bitcoin Act compare to ETFs? While ETFs cater to retail investors, the Bitcoin Act targets institutional and governmental adoption, offering long-term benefits. 3. What is the significance of a strategic Bitcoin reserve? It legitimizes Bitcoin as a strategic asset, reducing skepticism and encouraging institutional investments. 4. Could other countries follow the U.S. Bitcoin Act? Yes, Butterfill believes the Act could inspire other nations to adopt similar measures, boosting global Bitcoin adoption. 5. What are the potential risks of the Bitcoin Act? Regulatory pushback, political resistance, and short-term market volatility are key challenges. Conclusion The proposed U.S. Bitcoin Act could have a transformative impact on Bitcoin adoption, surpassing the effects of last year’s Bitcoin ETFs. By legitimizing Bitcoin as a national strategic asset, the Act has the potential to attract significant institutional investments, reduce skepticism, and inspire global adoption. While challenges remain, the Bitcoin Act represents a bold step toward integrating Bitcoin into the broader financial ecosystem, ensuring its role as a critical asset in the 21st century.

38743181,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/best-crypto-to-buy-now-meme-index-hits-2m-in-presale,1736661607,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/38743181.jpeg,Best Crypto To Buy Now? Meme Index Hits $2M In Presale,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/best-crypto-to-buy-now-meme-index-hits-2m-in-presale,"A new meme coin, Meme Index (MEMEX) , is receiving considerable praise early in its presale, with some calling it one of the best crypto to buy now. There is a strong demand for MEMEX among smart money investors and retailers alike, with the new meme coin having already raised over $2 million in its presale. Meme Index - Invest In Meme Coin Baskets The strong demand for meme coins means that the sector has ballooned to thousands of tokens, a number of which have high upside potential. While whales can easily invest in a broad selection of meme cryptos for outsized returns, small-scale retailers often have just enough funds for two to three investments. Their all-in approach also has considerable risk and opportunity cost — many tokens underperform while others may turn out to be scams. Consider, Moo Deng, for example. The meme coin is live on almost all top-tier CEXs, including Coinbase and Binance Futures. It currently represents the third-largest allocation by the trading firm Wintermute. And yet, the Moo Deng coin is down by nearly 30% since its Coinbase listing. While the meme coin is expected to eventually skyrocket, small-scale investors who went all-in on MOODENG are currently in significant losses. Meme Index is looking to tackle this issue head-on. It is the first-ever decentralized index fund for meme coins, seeking to offer broad market exposure to investors while spreading the risk. Investors will have their choice from four separate indexes. The Meme Titan Index will include blue-chip meme coins, many of which have multi-billion dollar valuations. The basket will likely feature assets like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe. Similarly, the Meme Moonshot Index will include the high-flyers — tokens that have been showcasing outsized growth and are poised to hit the billion-dollar mark. This basket could have projects like Notcoin, First Neiro On Ethereum and Snek. Third is the Meme Midcap Index, featuring assets within the $50 million and $250 million valuations. Investors could find the next Binance meme coins in the basket, especially since the world’s leading exchange has been listing low-cap crypto assets in recent months. Finally, the Meme Frenzy Index will include high-risk, high-reward meme coins. This index is designed for the degens and could offer outsized returns, especially in the upcoming meme coin supercycle. Notably, only MEMEX holders will be able to invest in these baskets, which explains the strong early demand for the new crypto coin. Moreover, they will vote on which meme coins are included in each basket, a feature that has impressed the experts. It will allow investors to benefit from community-intelligence — making money from investments that they otherwise would have missed out on. Moreover, it would be extremely unlikely that a scam token would make it into the basket. With its unique value proposition, it is no surprise that smart money investors are calling Meme Index one of the best crypto to buy now. Is MEMEX The Best Crypto To Buy Now? Aside from its innovation and community governance, MEMEX is also a meme coin with strong fundamentals. Smart money investors are impressed with its community-centric tokenomics, multiple security audits and strong social media presence. For instance, the Meme Index X account — which was created at the start of the presale — already has nearly 20k followers. This is on top of the 2.3k Telegram subscribers. Retail investors are also investing in MEMEX due to its presale staking platform, which is currently offering a reward rate of over 1100%. Unsurprisingly, Meme Index is being backed as one of the best crypto to buy now. Many smart money investors are eyeing up to 10x returns from it following its launch.

As Ripple continues to solidify its position in cross-border payment solutions, XRP is seen as a valuable asset in the evolving financial ecosystem. 2.

Reduced Circulating Supply Large-scale purchases remove significant quantities of XRP from circulation, potentially driving up demand. 3.

38825799,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=120536,1736662328,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"India Needs Favorable Policies for Web3 to Avoid Losing ₹17,700 Crores in TDS Revenue",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/india-favorable-web3-policies/,"India stands at a pivotal juncture in the global Web3 revolution. Despite having one of the largest cryptocurrency user bases, restrictive taxation and policies are driving Indian crypto traders and investors toward offshore platforms. This trend not only hampers the growth of the domestic Web3 ecosystem but also poses a risk of losing ₹17,700 crores in Tax Deducted at Source ( TDS ) revenue over the next five years. Organizations like CoinDCX and the Blockchain and Web3 Association (BWA) are advocating for friendlier policies and reduced tax burdens to keep India competitive in the Web3 space. With the Indian government inviting citizens to contribute their ideas for the Union Budget 2025-2026 , now is the time to act. The State of Web3 Taxation in India 1. High Tax Rates Are Pushing Users Offshore Since the 1% TDS on cryptocurrency transactions was implemented in July 2022 , over ₹500,000 crores have been traded on offshore crypto platforms . A report by Esya Centre estimates that India lost ₹6,000 crores in tax revenue as a result of this migration. 2. Complex Tax Laws Discourage Local Engagement The current Sections 194S and 115BBH of the Income Tax Act impose high tax burdens on crypto transactions, with a flat 30% tax rate on gains. This lack of differentiation between speculative trading and legitimate investments stifles the Web3 ecosystem’s potential. Why Favorable Policies for Web3 Are Essential 1. Economic Growth and Job Creation Web3 is a rapidly expanding industry that offers opportunities in blockchain development , DeFi , NFTs , and metaverse applications . Pro-business policies could foster job creation and economic growth, turning India into a global Web3 hub. 2. Boosting Tax Revenues Lowering the tax rate and encouraging onshore trading could significantly increase compliance, boosting tax revenues. 3. Retaining Talent and Capital Restrictive policies risk driving away India’s talented developers and entrepreneurs to countries with more crypto-friendly environments, such as Singapore or Dubai. Three Key Requests for Strengthening Web3 in India 1. Reduce the Crypto Tax Rate to 0.01% A lower TDS rate would reduce the burden on traders, encourage onshore trading, and improve compliance. Countries like Japan have implemented lower tax rates to foster innovation in blockchain and cryptocurrency. 2. Amend Sections 194S and 115BBH of the Income Tax Act Introduce provisions ensuring that offshore platforms comply with local tax laws , irrespective of their physical location. This would create a level playing field for domestic exchanges and discourage capital flight. 3. Provide Regulatory Clarity Establish clear guidelines for the taxation and operation of Web3 companies. Recognize cryptocurrencies and blockchain as legitimate industries, distinct from speculative gambling. How Citizens Can Contribute to Policy Change The Indian government is inviting citizens to submit suggestions for the Union Budget 2025-2026 . Here’s how you can help shape Web3 policy: Visit the official portal to share your suggestions: Union Budget Suggestions Portal Advocate for the following: Reduction of the crypto tax rate to 0.01% . Amendments to Sections 194S and 115BBH to ensure fair competition. Policies that encourage Web3 innovation and blockchain adoption . What’s at Stake if India Doesn’t Act? 1. Loss of Revenue India risks losing ₹17,700 crores in TDS revenue over the next five years if the current trends persist. 2. Brain Drain Top developers and entrepreneurs may relocate to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. 3. Missed Global Leadership Opportunities With countries like the UAE, Singapore, and Switzerland making strides in Web3, India could lose its chance to lead this global transformation. FAQs 1. Why should India reduce the crypto tax rate? Lowering the tax rate to 0.01% would encourage onshore trading, boost compliance, and increase tax revenues while fostering innovation. 2. What are Sections 194S and 115BBH of the Income Tax Act? These sections govern the taxation of cryptocurrency transactions, imposing high tax rates that discourage domestic engagement. 3. How can individuals contribute to Web3 policy reform? Citizens can share their suggestions on the Union Budget Suggestions Portal , advocating for friendlier Web3 policies. 4. What are the benefits of fostering Web3 innovation in India? Web3 has the potential to drive economic growth, create jobs, and position India as a global leader in blockchain technology. 5.

However, in the past weeks, XRP has broken through key resistance levels, which could signal the start of a new bullish trend. At the time of writing, XRP is trading above the $2.50 mark and is up by more than nine percent in the last 24 hours. When looking at the chart, the price of XRP is now positioned above certain important levels, hinting that the market could potentially move upwards towards new highs. Important Price Levels To Monitor Looking ahead, for XRP to continue its upward movement and reach new highs, it will need to break through some key resistance points. The first level to watch for an upward breakout is around $2.55, followed by another resistance level at $2.72. If XRP can clear both of these levels, it could pave the way for a rally that may take the price toward all-time highs. However, it’s important to note that there is an invalidation point for this bullish scenario. If the price drops below $1.96, this could signal that the current trend may not continue, and the market outlook would need to be reassessed. Therefore, the support levels in the $2.20-$2.30 range are critical for the short-term outlook of XRP. Technical Analysis: XRP has formed a triangle pattern, which consists of five waves: A-B-C-D-E. This pattern has now technically completed its minimum requirements. The formation of this pattern suggests that the price could break out either upwards or downwards. As of now, there has already been a positive reaction to the support areas between $2.20 and $2.30, which are Fibonacci levels that traders use to identify potential support and resistance zones.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-12 06:18:00

Despite challenging conditions, XRP has managed to maintain its position above key demand levels, fueling optimism among investors and analysts alike. As the market looks for signs of recovery, many see the altcoin as a potential leader poised for significant gains in the coming months. Related Reading: Whales Buy 470 Million Dogecoin In 48 Hours As Price Tests Crucial Demand Level – Details The anticipation of a massive rally continues to build, with investors eagerly awaiting XRP’s breakout above its all-time high (ATH). Such a move would mark a pivotal moment, setting the stage for price discovery and substantial growth. Adding to the optimism, top analyst Cheds Trading recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting a critical development in XRP’s price action. According to Cheds, XRP has scored a lower high break on the daily timeframe—an indicator that often signals a bullish continuation. This technical milestone suggests that XRP’s upward momentum could intensify soon, further solidifying its bullish outlook. With market participants closely monitoring these developments, XRP appears well-positioned to capitalize on any broader market recovery and lead the charge toward new heights. XRP Eyes Rally Amid Market Uncertainty XRP is trading just below a crucial supply zone. Market watchers are optimistic about its potential to ignite a massive rally if it breaks through this level. This optimism is fueled by XRP’s strong performance since the U.S. election, which has bolstered investor confidence in its prospects for 2025. Analyst BigCheds recently shared a technical analysis on X that adds weight to the bullish sentiment surrounding XRP. According to BigCheds, XRP has achieved a lower high break on the daily timeframe, which is a key technical signal for a bullish trend. This development suggests that the momentum is building, and XRP may be preparing for a significant breakout. For XRP to sustain this bullish trajectory, the next critical step is to break above the $2.80 mark. This level serves as a major barrier and a gateway to challenging its all-time high (ATH). If XRP reclaims this territory, it will enter price discovery—a phase often leading to exponential growth as buyers drive the price higher with little historical resistance.

Investors are closely monitoring these developments, as breaking the $2.80 level could set the stage for XRP to lead the market into a new era of gains. Price Action Shows Bulls In Control XRP is trading at $2.54 after an impressive 15% surge since Friday, showcasing renewed bullish momentum in a market filled with cautious optimism. Bulls have taken control, pushing the price higher and testing crucial resistance levels that could define the next phase of XRP’s rally. The immediate challenge for XRP lies at the $2.72 supply zone, a key level that hasn’t been tested since mid-December. Breaking above this critical resistance would signal the potential for a rally into uncharted territory, setting XRP toward price discovery. A breakout here would likely lead to an aggressive upward move, attracting fresh capital and fueling bullish sentiment. However, the bullish case is not without risks. XRP must hold above the $2.45 mark to sustain its upward trajectory. Failure to maintain this support could lead to increased selling pressure, possibly sending the price back into a consolidation phase.

Jones has addressed recent interpretations of her comments on XRP’s future. During Episode 1453 of her podcast, Jones provided important context about her perspective on the digital asset’s price trajectory, particularly addressing reports that suggested she had predicted a $100 valuation. The discussion emerged following Jones’s December 31, 2024, social media post where she illustrated XRP’s price evolution through a comparative analysis. She detailed how her initial investment demonstrated the significant growth XRP has experienced. XRP’s Growth Over the Years When Jones first entered the market, traders could buy 400 XRP for just $100 with tokens costing approximately $0.25. In contrast, the same $100 investment now yields roughly 44 XRP tokens, reflecting the substantial appreciation in value. Jones emphasized that her analysis was not intended as a short-term price prediction, but rather as an illustration of the digital asset’s evolution. “I’m just not going to give a price target,” she stated during her podcast, directly addressing the media’s interpretation of her comments. In her post from December, Jones compared XRP’s price, and wrote, “Sometime in the future, it will buy 1 XRP.” While she did not directly predict that the digital asset would grow to $100 , it is easy to imply that from her statement. She encouraged her audience to examine complete contexts rather than relying on headline interpretations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 When is XRP Going to $100 Jones clarified that she did not say XRP would reach $100 this year. XRP is trading at $2.53, following a massive 7.15% increase in the past 24 hours. Jones has an optimistic outlook on the asset’s future, particularly in light of evolving regulatory frameworks and institutional adoption patterns. While avoiding specific predictions, she suggests that the cryptocurrency market is in its early stages, indicating potential for significant future development. This suggests there is much room for growth, and the digital asset could hit the $100 target somewhere down the line. Jones’s analysis incorporates historical cryptocurrency market developments, particularly drawing from Bitcoin’s price evolution. Bitcoin began at almost nothing and recently hit an all-time high of over $108,000, showing the potential of cryptocurrencies. Jones also delved into regulatory developments affecting the cryptocurrency sector. She referenced significant policy statements, including those from former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in July 2019 regarding leveling the playing field in financial markets, and her recent post suggests XRP and the XRP Ledger can fulfill that role. While media attention has focused on potential price targets, Jones’s message emphasizes the digital asset’s potential. Although she did not provide a timeline, she expects big things for the digital asset. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

While the market has once again found support in a key area, the level could be broken to the downside soon. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart On the daily chart, the asset was recently pushed above the $100K level but failed to maintain momentum and fell down. Yet, the $92K level has once again held the cryptocurrency, preventing a deeper decline. Yet, as the level has been tested multiple times already, it is very likely that the price will break to the downside in case of another test. On the other hand, if the level holds, the market will once again try to break above the $100K level and pave its way toward a new all-time high. The 4-Hour Chart Looking at the 4-hour chart, the recent price action becomes much more clear to interpret. With a failed bullish breakout above $100K a few days ago, the market has experienced a quick downturn. However, the $92K level has halted the decline. Yet, the momentum is still bearish, as the market is not showing any significant willingness to rise back toward the $100K area. Therefore, if things remain the same, a breakdown of the $92K level and a drop toward the $85K mark will be probable. On-Chain Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Exchange Reserve While Bitcoin’s price has been consolidating below the $100K level over the past couple of months, market participants are becoming worried about the overall direction. This is quite clear when analyzing the futures market sentiment. This chart presents the funding rates metric, one of the best measures for evaluating the futures market sentiment. Positive values indicate bullish sentiment, and negative numbers are associated with a bearish sentiment. As the chart suggests, while the funding rates remain positive, they have significantly declined compared to December and even March last year when the market first touched the $70K mark. While this shows uncertainty by market participants, it also indicates that the futures market is not overheated, and sufficient spot market demand can push the price higher and initiate a sustainable rally.

The price remains confined within a sideways wedge pattern, highlighting a phase of consolidation and indecision. A decisive breakout is necessary to establish a sustained market direction. XRP Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Ripple’s current low volatility signals a lack of trading interest, potentially linked to broader macroeconomic factors, such as uncertainty surrounding President Trump’s transition to the White House. XRP’s price remains trapped within a wedge pattern and oscillates in the $2-$3 range even though it jumped to $2.6 yesterday evening. A breakout from this range is crucial, as it will likely dictate Ripple’s long-term trend. A bullish breakout could trigger a rally, while a bearish breakout may result in significant declines. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Ripple found support at the 0.5 Fibonacci level ($2), prompting a minor upward move. However, the price has now entered a low volatility phase with no clear directional bias. Ripple faces significant support near the 0.5 ($2) and 0.618 Fibonacci levels, which have served as strong defenses for buyers in recent months. If buyers manage to defend this region, XRP may experience a bullish spike. However, if sellers push the price below this key support zone, the market could face long liquidations, leading to a substantial decline.

Cardano (ADA) is one example of how a blockchain can originate to become a viable Layer 1 ecosystem. But often, the spotlight is cast on new contenders able to deliver extraordinary returns in the market. Cardano Price Journey: ADA Down 6% Daily As with Cardano’s story, it’s one of continuity and the ability to bounce back. As a competitor to Ethereum, it quickly gained traction based on its focus on scalability, sustainability, and security. Soon after, the Cardano price reached its all-time high at $3.10 in September 2021 and was recognized as one of the top cryptocurrencies. It was such an astronomical rise that it offered life-changing gains to early ADA investors who experienced the 14,400% increase in Cardano price. Like most cryptocurrencies, ADA also could not escape the subsequent market downturn. Currently, ADA trades at around $0.93 —which is far from the ATH Cardano price. As its ecosystem grows with new projects and partnerships, Cardano is only scratching the surface of what’s possible. However, analysts have noted that ADA’s potential for meteoric growth is limited by the size of its market cap, which, at over $32 billion, is extremely large. If you’re looking for a huge upside, Cardano prices today look decidedly more stable than transformative. Enter IntelMarkets (INTL): The Next Big Thing Cardano has made it big, but IntelMarkets is the future. The cutting-edge features of this project bring together artificial intelligence and blockchain technology to create a revolutionary AI-powered trading platform. IntelMarkets is preparing to change the face of how trading is done by targeting inefficiencies in the $264 billion crypto trading market. The experts behind IntelMarkets are a team of leading researchers from OpenAI and MIT who developed the proprietary Intell-M trading bots. By generating trading insights, INTL creates the opportunity for its platform to monitor mountains of market data in real-time and make very sophisticated trading decisions on its users’ behalf. Unlike other trading systems, IntelMarkets is constantly learning from past performance, and as a result, it’s a step ahead of its competition. Its early-stage value proposition makes IntelMarkets even more compelling. The INTL token is in the ninth presale phase of its ICO and is priced at $0.082 at present. Its high reward and low entry point make it a promising investment. IntelMarkets may register a whopping 14,400% growth; it could go toe to toe with Cardano’s meteoric rise in the 2021 bull run, experts predict. The Next Cardano is Here ADA has a great legacy as one of the top altcoins, but the room for growth on Cardano prices is limited by its size and the fact that it’s become established in the market. With its AI-powered approach to crypto trading, IntelMarkets is revolutionizing blockchain innovation. Being a low-priced investment with enormous potential for life-changing returns makes it an unrivaled option for investors seeking to change their lives.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-is-days-away-from-breakout-towards-new-all-time-highs-heres-why/,"An analysis of XRP’s current market position suggests that a significant price move is imminent, and this move could send it to a new all-time high. Currently trading at $2.56, the digital asset has demonstrated notable resilience and strength, capturing the attention of analysts. One of the key factors driving optimism is XRP’s stability around critical Fibonacci retracement levels. Cryptocurrency analyst The Great Mattsby (@matthughes13) recently highlighted on X that the token’s positioning near the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level is a crucial technical signal. He showed that breaking above $2.36, which aligns with the 0.886 Fibonacci level, could pave the way for a substantial price rally, indicating strong bullish momentum. According to Mattsby, the digital asset is potentially days away from a new all-time high, and now that it has broken above $2.36, it is much closer to achieving this goal. This daily chart suggests that $XRP might just be weeks, if not days away from a breakout towards all time highs. Perhaps it just once to touch the cloud ONCE before launch pic.twitter.com/7gfwZwmTy2 — The Great Mattsby (@matthughes13) January 10, 2025 Additional XRP Bullish Signs Adding to this outlook, XRP trades well above the Ichimoku Cloud, a widely regarded indicator of market sentiment and momentum. The asset’s price exceeds the Conversion Line at $2.33 and the Base Line at $2.31, typically associated with upward trends in asset prices. Significant accumulation by whales further highlights XRP’s positive trajectory. Historically, such accumulation patterns have been precursors to significant price movements, suggesting institutional confidence in XRP’s long-term potential. From a market structure perspective, analyst Captain Faibik has noted XRP’s breakout from a descending channel, a development that traditionally signals a shift in market dynamics. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potential Targets for XRP This breakout and the token’s ability to maintain a price above $2, have led to ambitious projections. Faibik suggested XRP could target $3.66, a level supported by his technical indicators and sustained trading activity. Market factors are also bolstered by increasing adoption. David Stryzewski, CEO of Sound Planning Group, recently revealed that Bank of America has incorporated XRP into its internal transaction processes, further validating its utility. This development aligns with broader expectations for increased adoption, particularly if cryptocurrency-friendly regulations emerge. With XRP on the rise again, investors will eagerly observe its price to see what direction it takes. The market has significant positive momentum, and this could help the asset reach the $3.66 level or a new all-time high soon.

Several technical signals, such as the Golden Cross and bounce from the $91,000-$92,000 zone, are pointing to the fact that the crypto bull run is far from over. With BTC ripe for a major comeback , this could be the perfect opportunity to invest in altcoins – and there’s hardly a better time to purchase these tokens than in their presales. In this article, we bring to you the top 4 altcoin presales dominating the market right now. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Overall Best Crypto Presale in 2025 Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) gives retail investors trading signals and insights into the crypto market that are usually only accessible to Wall Street investors. Its goal is to create an active community that can take power away from the hands of crypto whales, empowering the common man. The token went into presale towards the end of 2024. So far, it has managed to raise more than $45M . Currently, each token is priced at $0.00036646, but the next phase of the presale is only a few hours away, so right now is the cheapest available price. As per some experts, $WEPE could be the best-performing token in 2025. The biggest reason for this is that while some meme coins are just a trend (meaning their popularity might crash at any time), $WEPE actually solves the problem of crypto whales manipulating the market and creates an even playing ground for everyone. Some even say that $WEPE might outperform $PEPU, whose price jumped by 500% after launch. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Layer-2 Solution on the Solana Network Solaxy ($SOLX) is native to the Solana blockchain and is, in fact, the first-ever Solana Layer-2 upgrade. It aims to mitigate the problems of Solana’s current network, such as traffic congestion and slow transactions. The project has raised over $9.8M so far and plans to raise more. One $SOLX is currently available at $0.001598, and you can read more about the project in its whitepaper and by following its X feed . Speaking of $SOLX’s growth, some experts initially believed it might be the next 100x token. However, its latest performance suggests that it could very well soar past 200% from its current presale price. 2025 will probably be its best year. 3. Flockerz ($FLOCK) – Vote-to-Earn Project Nearing $10M in Presale Flockerz ($FLOCK) is a unique vote-to-earn platform that rewards investors with free tokens for sharing their opinions on important platform decisions. For example, the platform might ask which exchange should the token be listed on after presale. The users who share their opinions will be rewarded, regardless of the final decision. Like $WEPE, $FLOCK, too, launched its presale towards the end of 2024 and has managed to raise over $9.5M so far. If you get in right now, you’ll only have to shell out $0.0066883 per $FLOCK token. Interested investors should hurry up because the token is in its final presale stage, which ends in around 10 days. In addition to an impressive 283% staking APY, which is certainly another key attraction for investors, $FLOCK has a sizable following on platforms like X and Telegram . 4. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Proprietary Token of The Fastest-Growing Crypto Wallet in 2025 Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is native to the popular crypto wallet Best Wallet . Holders of these tokens get a wealth of extra benefits, such as lower transaction fees and higher staking rewards. The wallet itself has many interesting features. For example, it gives you access to vetted tokens at presale stage 0, when the prices are their absolute lowest. This project, too, gives investors voting rights, meaning you can influence the direction of the project. What’s more, given that Best Wallet is all set to capture over 40% of the non-custodial wallet market by 2026, there’s no denying $BEST’s potential for massive gains. Currently in presale, $BEST has managed to raise close to $7M. Each token is priced at $0.023575, but prices will increase in the next couple of days. Verdict – Superb Potential, But Not Without Risks It’s important to remember that although these coins have serious potential, most of which is backed by a slew of unique features and not just hype, the crypto scene is pretty volatile – as it has always been. As always, we recommend being very thorough with your own research (DYOR) before ultimately putting your money into the crypto market. Another rule of thumb is to always only spend how much you’re comfortable losing.",Altcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-12 07:15:27

Pepe Rescues Trump (PEPERTRU), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPERTRU is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Rescues Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Rescues Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Rescues Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Rescues Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Rescues Trump by entering its contract address – HtgdKmNDff2UgXmmJYCryKhjVE2F89XMncNt8oThipHz – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPERTRU. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 07:20:00

With the right picks, even a small investment of $500 could grow into a million-dollar portfolio. Among the most promising candidates are BigBossInu, Cardano (ADA), Bitcoin (BTC), Kaspa (KAS), and Arbitrum (ARB). Here’s a closer look at why these digital assets stand out as top choices for exponential growth. BIG BOSS INU’s Hot Presale Ignites Investor Interest BIG BOSS INU is quickly gaining recognition in the crypto scene, with its presale generating immense excitement among early investors. Seen as a high-reward opportunity for those who act fast, BIG BOSS INU is drawing widespread attention. As the excitement around its presale peaks, BIG BOSS INU has emerged as one of the top cryptos to watch this November. Backed by a strong development plan and cutting-edge features, BigBossInu is on track for substantial growth in the near future >>>>>> Cardano (ADA) Although ADA remains well below its all-time peak of $3.09, the crypto community is optimistic about its future prospects. Some improvements are expected to play a crucial role in driving ADA’s value higher as more use cases and applications emerge. Bitcoin’s (BTC) Bitcoin (BTC) continues to hold a strong bullish position, trading near $92,000. Market sentiment indicates the potential for BTC to surge past the $110,000 mark, though possible corrections might bring the price down to support levels around $100,000. Increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin is expected to bolster its upward trajectory further. Kaspa (KAS), currently priced at a modest $0.05, has made waves in the crypto space with its rapid and efficient Proof-of-Work transaction capabilities. Its low-cost entry point is attracting attention from many in the market. However, savvy investors are increasingly looking toward BigBossInu, which not only matches Kaspa’s transaction speeds but also boasts a dynamic growth trajectory. Arbitrum (ARB) is at the forefront of Layer-2 solutions for Ethereum, enhancing its network by offering faster and more cost-effective transactions. Its technology has become a go-to choice for developers looking to build scalable and efficient decentralized applications. >>> Conclusion For those looking to turn a small investment into a fortune, these five altcoins — BIG BOSS INU, Cardano (ADA), Bitcoin (BTC), Kaspa (KAS), and Arbitrum (ARB) — offer a unique mix of technology, scalability, and growth potential. Each of these digital assets has the power to transform a $500 investment into a million-dollar portfolio before the next bull market takes off.

After starting the year with a 20% increase in value, XRP has continued its upward momentum, trading at $2.54 at press time. This marks a near 9% increase from yesterday, highlighting its strong performance despite a period of market consolidation. Amonyx (@amonbuy), a prominent figure in the XRP community, highlighted the asset’s momentum, stating that the “floor has been activated” and asking XRP holders to prepare. Amonyx has consistently supported XRP and the current performance reinforces his bullish sentiment. XRP’s Remarkable Performance XRP outperformed most of its competitors in 2024, with a 300% surge in November and a subsequent climb in December. The cryptocurrency’s price surge brought it to levels not seen since 2018, reaching a peak of $2.86 in early December. According to the TLDR from CoinMarketCap, XRP’s current momentum is driven by its integral role in advancing financial systems and its use in innovative payment solutions. Ripple’s strategic considerations, including the potential launch of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF), further bolster the asset’s position in the market. The announcement of significant leadership changes at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also contributed to the market optimism surrounding XRP. Gary Gensler, the current SEC Chair, has confirmed his resignation effective January 20, 2025. President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkins as his successor. Atkins is widely regarded as a crypto-friendly figure, and his potential leadership has sparked speculation that the new administration could resolve the long-running legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Everyone Is Bullish On XRP Community sentiment within the XRP ecosystem reflects this optimism, as Amonyx received many positive replies and many community members showed excitement and anticipation. Ripple’s broader efforts to expand its influence in the financial sector have also been noteworthy. The company has consistently advocated for regulatory clarity and has positioned XRP as a critical tool for cross-border payments and liquidity solutions. The potential introduction of an XRP-focused ETF is seen as a strategic move to attract institutional investors and reinforce its market standing. Multiple companies have already filed for XRP ETFs, and Ripple President Monica Long believes the new administration could expedite the approval process . With significant developments on the horizon, including the transition to a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, the cryptocurrency appears well-positioned to capitalize on its recent gains.

Analyst Evaluated,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-could-happen-to-bitcoin-price-on-the-day-of-trumps-inauguration-how-will-cryptocurrencies-move-after-trump-analyst-evaluated/,"The cryptocurrency market is bracing for turbulence as the new U.S. administration takes office. The largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is recovering after a shaky start to the year as investors debate the future of crypto under President Trump. Tanaya Macheel, a market analyst, suggests that the first quarter could be a volatile one as conflicting elements of the administration’s agenda come to the fore. A pro-crypto White House and Congress present opportunities for better regulation, while other policies like tariffs that strengthen the US dollar could weigh on Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin rallied over 45% in the month following the election, but tariff concerns have dampened enthusiasm and posed risks to both cryptocurrencies and the broader markets. “This clash between pro-crypto regulation and a stronger dollar shows the dual nature of the administration’s influence on crypto trading,” Macheel said. Related News: Attention Analysis Company Announced! ""If This Metric Fluctuates, Bitcoin Volatility Will Increase A Lot"" Despite the short-term risks, analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term potential. It’s been a year since Bitcoin ETFs were approved, and their growing popularity, combined with regulatory clarity, could boost Bitcoin prices. Some investors believe BTC could double in value by the end of the year, helped by congressional debates on issues like stablecoins and market structure. However, Macheel warned that the effects of any regulatory progress may not be felt until later in the year, leaving room for market uncertainty in the meantime. Phil, a portfolio manager, noted the impact of Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT, the most successful ETF launch in history. However, he noted that a shift occurred last week when the fund recorded its first significant outflow, losing $337 million in a single day. Phil suggested that Bitcoin’s consolidation phase could either lead to higher highs or a temporary shakeout in weak hands. While the inauguration could prompt a “buy the rumor, sell the news” reaction, it could set the stage for a stronger rally. *This is not investment advice.

As more Bitcoin liquidation levels are stacking up, there’s a looming risk that Bitcoin could face downward pressure in the short term. One factor influencing Bitcoin’s price right now is BlackRock’s decision to sell off a large amount of Bitcoin recently. The firm saw a $184 million outflow from its Bitcoin ETFs on Friday. Bitcoin Price Levels: Testing Support and Resistance When it comes to Bitcoin’s price levels, the cryptocurrency is currently facing several challenges. On the weekly chart, analyst Josh of Crypto World said that the price is encountering resistance at a key Fibonacci extension level around $102,000. This level has become a major hurdle for Bitcoin, as it shows a significant point where the price could either bounce back or face further downward pressure. Despite this resistance, Bitcoin is still in a larger bullish trend, as indicated by the SuperTrend indicator, which remains in the green. However, there’s a bearish divergence forming on the weekly chart, signaling that the bullish momentum may be slowing down. This divergence suggests that Bitcoin could experience a cooldown, which might lead to short-term price pullbacks or sideways movement. Important Short-Term Targets A key price range to watch is between $96,300 and $100,518, which may act as a resistance zone for a potential corrective rally. If Bitcoin can break above $100,518, it may mean a shift toward higher targets. Alternatively, there is a scenario where Bitcoin could hit a Fibonacci extension level of $87,748, which could serve as a potential low for the correction, though this remains less likely. Whether Bitcoin continues its bullish run or faces a short-term correction, traders should be paying close attention to the support and resistance levels discussed above.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-12 07:53:47

According to the US Office of Government Ethics, Bessent will have to relinquish his position at the hedge fund immediately after the Senate’s approval. However, for his shares, he’d have a 90-day window post-confirmation to divest them. Bessent revealed his assets, valued at more than $500 million State officials must report their assets and provide plans to divest holdings that could present conflicts of interest before the Senate confirms them. Bessent’s hearing is set for Thursday next week, and he will be required to reveal his holdings. His publicly disclosed personal financial statement shows his assets are valued at $521 million. Among his highest-valued holdings are two tranches of US Treasury bills, two Invesco funds, and foreign currency positions linked to the Key Square Group. He also acknowledged his personal investment at an iShares Bitcoin ETF, worth about $500,000, which he will need to divest post-confirmation. Other assets include a $25 million farmland in North Dakota, a $25 million Bahamian property, and at least $1 million worth of art and antiques. In his letter to the Treasury Department’s ethics office, Bessent made it clear that he plans to shut down the investment firm Key Square Capital Management, resign from the Bessent-Freeman Family Foundation, and relinquish his role at Rockefeller University as chairman of the investment committee post-confirmation. He will also sell several other investments, such as his stake at All Seasons, a conservative book publishing company. Bessent will help Trump with his pro-crypto agenda Scott Bessent emerged as the top pick for the treasury secretary seat, edging out competitors like Apollo Global Management Inc. executive Marc Rowan, former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty, and Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick. If he earns Senate approval, Bessent is expected to aid Trump in rolling out tax cuts, imposing new tariffs, and renegotiating some trade deals. Given his experience with digital assets, Bessent is also projected to play a vital role in pushing for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, especially with Trump proposing the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve.

Catslap ($SLAP) is a one-of-a-kind meme coin where all token holders can earn slap points by just slapping their favorite characters on the homepage. The more the number of slaps, the more points you get. Each of the top 10 slappers will get a $10K USDT airdrop. Even if you do not make it to the top 10, you’ll get $SLAP tokens as per your position on the leaderboard. However, there was another dimension to this challenge – completing tasks on Zealy. For those unaware, Zealy is a tasking-questing platform used by brands to build a community through a reward-based system. Catslap enthusiasts were required to join the Catslap Zealy page and complete social and on-chain tasks to earn Zealy points. These points weigh more than the slap points. One point on Zealy is equal to 1000 slap points. The more tasks you complete on Zealy, the higher your chances of making it to the top 10. This means that there are two leaderboards: one with the slap points and one with Zealy points. As per the Catslap team’s Telegram communication, the Zealy points will be converted into slap points to arrive at the final leaderboard list on Tuesday. Now, although you could have used any EVM-compatible crypto wallet to participate in these two challenges, you need a Best Wallet crypto address to claim your rewards. In fact, Catslap has an affiliation with Best Wallet , where you can buy the token directly from Best Wallet. Is It a Good Time to Buy the Catslap Dip? Catslap ($SLAP) launched on the MEXC exchange on December 6 and made a high of $0.010546, delivering 251% returns on the same day. Early investors made as much as 4x on their investments. Since then, the coin has seen a 68% dip in prices and is currently trading below its opening price on the listing date. This begs the question of whether it’s a good time to buy the dip. Catslap is a community-driven meme coin launched directly on decentralized exchange to compete with the likes of $POPCAT. It started 2025 on a positive note with 45% gains in the first week. And now, the price may just be ripe for a fresh entry in what’s a high-potential meme coin. We say so for several reasons. Firstly, Catslap plans to burn $1M $SLAP tokens on January 31. It has already burnt $1.18M worth of tokens so far. Burning tokens rebalances the demand and supply forces, leading the prices to go up. Secondly, Catslap has an active buyback program in place where it buys back tokens from the open market. So far, $883,637.54 worth of $SLAP tokens have been bought back. Just like token burning, buying back tokens also strengthens the price of the underlying asset by controlling the supply. Plus, there’s an active staking program where token holders can earn up to 30% APY on their staked tokens. Verdict – Onwards and Upwards for $SLAP All these are positive signs for this small-cap meme coin. This shows the dedication of the founders to make Catslap one of the biggest meme coins going around. It has an active following of over 12K members on X , besides an active Telegram community. Moreover, it has also been audited by SolidProof and has a good TrustNet Score of 60.30, indicating that it’s a very trustworthy asset in the Web3 space. It’s worth noting that $SLAP has already made a return of 2,360% for investors, and you may not get the opportunity to buy Catslap at a current price of $0.002376 again. However, as always, this isn’t investment advice. Also, we highly recommend doing your own research (DYOR) before you part with your money.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-12 08:00:51

In a new strategy session on YouTube, the pseudonymous trader known as DonAlt tells his 65,000 subscribers that price targets for BTC above $150,000 are likely too aggressive. DonAlt also says that he’s anticipating an end to the market cycle in the next couple of months, rather than targeting a late-2025 peak that some analysts are forecasting. “I would like to see a last leg for everything. Like an aggressive last leg. Bitcoin to like $150,000, I think that’s already a tall ask, if everything goes crazy maybe it doubles but I don’t think this cycle we’re going to see more than $200,000, I think $150,000 would be a lot already. So Bitcoin [could go] another 10-20-30-40-50% if it goes really well. I think at that point you’re stretching it, and $100,000 is already basically the target that makes the most sense, everything else is a little bit more aggressive. I hope we’re going to see a little bit of an altcoin rotation at the end of it. That’s kind of where my mind’s set but let’s see, it’s hard to predict this time around. I think time-wise, I don’t give it much more than a couple of months, at best, for this cycle to end. I could be wrong, we’ll see how it goes.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,586.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/wealth-mentor-believes-xrp-will-make-holders-rich-heres-why/,"Linda Jones, a prominent figure in the crypto wealth mentorship space, has recently endorsed the claim that XRP has the potential to generate significant wealth for its holders. Jones’s response came as an agreement to a statement by technical analyst Steph, who shared a compelling analysis regarding whale activity in the XRP market. Steph, a well-known chartist, highlighted data from CryptoQuant, showcasing substantial whale engagement with XRP. He asserted in a tweet that “whales are all in on #XRP,” further claiming that holders of the token “are all going to be rich.” Linda Jones responded with a succinct affirmation, saying, “Yep.” As previously reported by Times Tabloid, Jones projected that XRP could reach $100 per token , a price point that would represent a remarkable 4229% increase from its current level of $2.31 Yep. https://t.co/341vobB0oL — Linda P. Jones (@LindaPJones) January 9, 2025 Analyzing Whale Transactions with Binance Steph’s claim is underpinned by data from CryptoQuant showing increased whale transactions involving XRP and Binance, the leading crypto exchange by trading volume. The chart he shared revealed that whale-to-exchange activity for XRP has surged significantly in recent months. This trend began gaining momentum in late 2024 and peaked in early January 2025. Notably, on January 2, the number of whale transactions to Binance reached 63,968, marking a multi-year high. Similarly, CryptoQuant reported a significant inflow of 2.73 billion XRP to Binance on January 4. However, 2.87 billion XRP outflowed the same day, effectively neutralizing the inflow. By January 9, whale activity had tapered, with transactions to Binance falling to 3,305. The corresponding inflow of XRP on that day amounted to 134 million tokens. Although increased inflows to exchanges from whales are typically perceived as bearish, as they often indicate selling pressure, Steph interpreted the development optimistically. He anticipates that sustained whale interest in XRP will ultimately benefit its value. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Price Trends and Whale Engagement Recent price movements of XRP seem closely tied to whale activity on Binance. Data suggests a pattern where spikes in whale-to-exchange transactions correlate with increases in XRP’s price, while declines in such transactions align with price dips. For instance, on December 24, whale transactions to Binance rose sharply to 28,013. On the same day, XRP’s price recovered to $2.32. Conversely, when whale transactions dropped to 770 on December 30, XRP’s price fell below $2. A similar pattern emerged in January 2025. When whale transactions surged to 63,968 on January 2, XRP’s price climbed to $2.50. However, by January 9, as transactions decreased significantly, XRP’s price declined to $2.20. Outlook on XRP’s Wealth Potential Linda Jones’ endorsement of XRP’s potential aligns with broader optimism among some analysts and investors. While whale activity is often a complex indicator, with both bullish and bearish implications depending on the context, the continued engagement of major investors with XRP reflects sustained interest in the token.

As we approach Donald Trump’s inauguration, the market is expected to recover, and BTC could breech $100,000 again. While BTC remains the undisputed market leader, we are also nearing altcoin season, which will result in massive price gains. The altcoin market, particularly memecoins, made incredible gains following Donald Trump’s election win. Memecoins have become an increasingly popular investment opportunity with the potential for triple-digit gains. Let’s look at the performance of Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Dogwifhat (WIF) and explore Husky Inu (HINU), the newest memecoin sensation from the Solana network. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE), the top memecoin by market cap, exploded in the weeks following the US election to become the 7th largest crypto with a market cap exceeding $50.2 billion. Dogecoin (DOGE) is undoubtedly following an upward trajectory, surging over 304% in the past year. The OG memecoin quickly rose through the ranks to become a household name in the crypto industry, owing its success to a strong community and endless potential. DOGE began its journey in the industry as a joke but has transitioned into a legitimate investment opportunity with excellent profit potential. The memecoin skyrocketed with the involvement and endorsement of Elon Musk. Musk, the world’s richest man with a net worth exceeding $400 billion, is the CEO of Tesla, owner of social media platform X (formerly Twitter), and one of the president-elect’s most prominent supporters. The tech wizard joined the Trump campaign and was integral to Trump’s victory, and his involvement with the republican party could see DOGE run to new highs in the coming months. DOGE’s surge stepped into overdrive after Donald Trump released a statement revealing that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to Trump, DOGE will pave the way for his administration to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditure, and restructure Federal Agencies – Essential to the “Save America” Movement.” Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the top-selling memecoins with a market cap exceeding $12 billion. The decentralized community-led token and its reputation as the “Dogecoin Killer” has yielded impressive rewards in the past year, gaining over 115%. SHIB is also a proud member of the Solana network and is Husky Inu’s best friend. The memecoin quickly rose to fame in the crypto industry and has since become a household name. SHIB, launched in 2020, is currently the 15th largest crypto by market cap and the second biggest memecoin after Dogecoin (DOGE). This decentralized, community-led project and its native token, SHIB, quickly gained the attention of its dedicated community of investors thanks to its charm and support from industry giants such as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF) is still new to the industry but has made a significant impact since joining. WIF has high hopes of becoming the new top dog, and despite its infancy, yielded an impressive 535% gain in the past year, currently trading around $1.55. Dogwifhat (WIF) stepped into the spotlight after crypto exchange Coinbase announced it would support WIF for trading. WIF’s recent gains have analysts predicting a potential 2000% increase for the year, placing it firmly on investors' radar. WIF’s impressive gain is supported by its strong community engagement, strategic partnerships, and bullish market sentiment. Husky Inu (HINU) Husky Inu (HINU) is one of the newest members of the highly coveted Solana network, created to bring its holders more value and utility by harnessing the power of this popular blockchain. The project has raised attention because of its ambition to compete with the best in the memecoin industry. Husky Inu recently launched the presale of its native token, HINU , with tremendous success, and the two are on a mission to conquer the memecoin industry through a robust and supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Since going live, the presale has generated nearly $700,000, with numbers rapidly rising, and it will soon reach its fundraising target. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting. Husky Inu is still in presale and is set to gain majorly following exchange listings. HINU presale tokens are available at a modest $0.00015000 with exceptional profit potential for early backers.

Experts predict a remarkable 10,000% token price growth for FXGuys by the end of 2025, and with $FXG gaining momentum, this token is shaping up to be a crypto game-changer! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Solana Dominates DEX Trading, But DeFi Coin Price Volatility Raises Questions Solana has grabbed attention in the crypto world with its recent milestones. The network recently surpassed Ethereum and Base in 24-hour DEX trading volume. Data from DefiLlama revealed that Solana-based DEXs reached a staggering $3.8 billion in daily volume on January 6, 2025. This outperformed Ethereum’s $1.7 billion and Base’s $1.2 billion, solidifying Solana’s growing dominance in DeFi. Despite these achievements, SOL’s DeFi coin price has shown notable volatility. From December 2024 to early January 2025, SOL’s price dropped from $238 to $204 . This fall from grace leaves many questioning Solana’s short-term growth potential. Market analysts predict SOL could face further price pressure, possibly falling to the $200 mark. While Solana token holders contemplate their next moves, some are pivoting to newer opportunities like FXGuys . Chainlink Whale Panic Sparks Bearish Sentiment: Is the DeFi Coin Price Under Threat? Chainlink’s recent token price action has triggered notable movements among its whale investors. The DeFi coin price rallied to $30 in December 2024, prompting significant profit-taking by large holders. On-chain data reveals increased whale activity, with transactions exceeding $1 million spiking during this period. The most notable transaction days were December 20 and December 26, 2024. These dates coincided with a rejection of LINK’s price at $25, signaling increased selling pressure. Experts suggest this behavior mirrors patterns from late 2021, indicating a wave of panic-driven exits among major investors. The liquidation heatmap confirms a steady decline in LINK’s DeFi coin price, which has dropped from $30 to $21 in just a few weeks. As LINK continues to slide, analysts are closely watching its next support level at $19. While the DeFi coin price declines, some Chainlink token holders are exploring new opportunities.

The rate of crime in the crypto sector industry has continued to grow exponentially, causing worries for authorities and market enthusiasts. Schwartz, in a recent post on X, warned against scammers targeting crypto holders specifically. In his post on X, the Ripple CTO alerted the crypto community to a potential phishing scam, with bad actors targeting their assets. He posted a picture of a Coinbase email prompting him to update his account, with a tab that he is supposed to click to carry out the process. He noted that the emails are fake and do not always come from the real exchange. They are embedded with malicious links designed for stealing purposes. Ripple CTO wants users to be vigilant In his post , the Ripple CTO told the crypto community that every email that looks like that is a scam. The scammers usually embed their links, which most times, take a resemblance to the real website. Once users click the link, they either download malicious software or are redirected to the fake website. They are then asked to update their details on the platform to increase the security of their account. Scam Warning: If you see an email that looks like this, it’s a scam. pic.twitter.com/klneRy7dor — David “JoelKatz” Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 11, 2025 Unknown to the users, they have given their account details to the criminals. After confirmation, the criminals receive their information, sometimes attached to their private keys. Once all information is completely verified, they swing into action, emptying the user’s wallet at will. In this case, there is nothing the user can do to stop the criminals from stealing their digital assets. In other cases, downloading malicious software allows the criminal access to the complete system, enabling theft. Aside from imitating popular exchanges, scammers send users emails that are not even affiliated with any exchange. It is usually about the users winning a prize or a promotion and they need to download a certain file to acknowledge participation. This recent warning by the Ripple CTO mirrors several reports of an increase in scams towards the end of last year, with projections that it may become worse this year. The crypto community has always seen the important job that the Ripple CTO does, with another honorable mention being ZachXBT. According to a user on X, Schwartz has been watching out for the community, alerting them to things like this, and they do not take it for granted. The security tips have often worked for most users, saving them from losing part or all of their portfolios to these criminals. Increase in scams and the battle against it Ripple has been calling out the increase in scams over the last few years, warning users to tread carefully when carrying out their activities. Last year, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse ripped into X and YouTube for allowing criminals to take advantage of their platforms to scam unsuspecting victims. He mentioned that several XRP-related scams have been perpetrated using the platforms. While the platforms have come up with several initiatives to get rid of bad actors, they have become a cancer that won’t die, always finding ways to bypass detection mechanisms. XRP community users took advantage of Schwartz’s post to share security tips among themselves. A user stated that he has never clicked on a link he did not ask for from the exchange. He highlighted that it has helped him avoid scammers, as they have become sophisticated. The phishing email shared by the Ripple CTO is just one of the many ways the criminals operate. They create an air of urgency, asking users to act quickly. Most times, it is updating their accounts and other times, it is claiming a giveaway. According to experts, users must refrain from clicking on any link attached to their emails, because their exchanges would never ask them to. Instead, they should go to their account directly to sort out any issue they may have.

Elon Buys Solana (ELONBSOL), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Buys Solana launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 85b1Mza2zF6SDGXZURjeu53wdapN6W1UjFC4PAqhKE8k – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 08:42:00

Chainlink (LINK) has surged 18% over three days, driven by whale accumulation of over 1.40 million tokens. Chainlink’s surge highlights growing market confidence, with traders optimistic about sustained growth. Simultaneously, World3’s partnership with Microsoft is enhancing the role of AI in Web3. By leveraging Azure cloud services, World3 aims to deliver smarter, automated tools that streamline decentralized applications.

This momentum has solidified Web3Bay’s reputation as a top decentralized e-commerce marketplace powered by blockchain. LINK Surges Driven by Whale Activity & Market Confidence Chainlink (LINK) has experienced a remarkable 18% surge over just three days, driven largely by whale accumulation. Chainlink’s surge follows the accumulation of over 1.40 million LINK tokens by large-scale investors, which has significantly impacted the market. Traders and analysts alike are closely monitoring this Chainlink surge as whales continue to bet on long-term growth, fueling optimism for the token’s future. As whales continue to accumulate LINK, they provide liquidity and stability, fueling speculation that this Chainlink surge could lead to sustained growth. A decline in exchange outflows, which indicates fewer tokens being sold, further supports Chainlink’s bullish momentum. Microsoft & World3’s Partnership to Enhance Web3 with AI World3’s partnership with Microsoft is set to revolutionize the integration of AI technology in Web3 applications. As part of the Microsoft for Startups program, World3 will leverage Azure's cloud services to enhance its decentralized user experiences with AI agents.

The token is currently priced at a competitive price of $0.0039675. Early adopters are in for a huge treat as the BAY3 token’s price is set to see an extraordinary 6430% jump when it launches at $0.1959. Such returns position Web3Bay as a top-tier asset to hold right now to become part of this revolutionary project in the Web3 technology space. Web3Bay’s key features, such as cross-chain compatibility, set it apart in a competitive market. This ensures seamless interaction with multiple blockchains, providing traders with flexibility and scalability for future growth. The platform’s use of decentralized technology fosters security, ownership, and transparency—pillars of the next era in e-commerce.

Key Takeaways Chainlink’s surge, bolstered by whale activity, highlights its growing appeal among large-scale investors, with its recent gains reflecting strong market confidence. On the other hand, World3’s partnership with Microsoft demonstrates how AI-driven solutions can enhance decentralized applications, creating smarter, more efficient tools for Web3.

The trend has led crypto analysts to suggest that the altcoins market is ready for a bull run in 2025. Crypto analyst and conversation starter Burakkesmeci said , “ With growing retail participation, the dominance of altcoins (others, excluding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)) in Binance trading volume has consistently risen, reaching 77.83% as of January 2025. This trend highlights the growing shift of investor focus towards altcoins on the largest exchange by trading volume.” Binance users drive altcoin trading volume higher According to Burakkesmeci, the Binance altcoin trading volume by pairs is about 78% in January 2025, accounting for 11% growth in the last five months. The growth in altcoin trading volume has been steady and consistent, and there is growing hope among analysts that a potential bull market is around the corner. CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season index is not pulling huge numbers for altcoins, as seen on Binance. It gives altcoins a score of 46%, suggesting that Bitcoin season is in the offing. The index compares the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap based on their rolling 90-day price performances. Most traders rely on Bitcoin dominance to establish when the altcoin season will start. Bitcoin dominance is a metric that shows its share of total market cap, and mostly, when it drops, it signals the start of an altcoin season. The current data from TradingView places Bitcoin dominance at 57.74%, translating to a 2.41% rise over the last 30 days. Ether’s growth may trigger the entire altcoin market Mister Crypto, a vocal crypto trader and analyst on X , believes that Ether will break the resistance in the coming weeks and shoot from $4000 to $8000. Such growth will trigger the entire altcoin market to grow. Ether is trading at $3,279 , down 15.77% over the past 30 days. The conversations around Bitcoin are diverse this year, with most players agreeing that 2025 will be a huge year for cryptocurrency. Bitwise Invest CEO Hunter Horsley added his voice to the conversation through an X post . He said that he is fired up for the leap forward BTC and other cryptos will make this year. Other analysts warn that the altcoin season may be different from other years. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, believes that the market cycle may show an irregular pattern as altcoin season is no longer triggered by investors rotating capital gains from Bitcoin into altcoins. He says the current altcoin market cap can compare to that of Bitcoin, which has grown two-fold since 2021, but he insists that only altcoin projects with strong use cases and narratives will see the light of day.

However, some on-chain metrics suggest that the asset could face trouble in the following days, especially if it fails to close above $2.47. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView As reported on Saturday evening, XRP’s rally drove the asset from $2.33 to $2.5 and later to $2.6, which represented an 11.5% surge within less than 24 hours. Although the asset has lost some steam since then and currently sits at $2.51, it’s still over 6% up on the day. This came shortly after reports emerged that whales had amassed more than a billion XRP tokens within a mere 48-hour period during the most recent correction in the middle of the business week. However, this is where the popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez sounded the alarm about a potential drawback for XRP’s price. At first, he pointed out that the TD Sequential, a technical indicator used to show the market exhaustion in either direction, had flashed a sell signal on the 4-hour chart. Nevertheless, this bearish formation will be invalidated if the asset closes above that line, which it still maintains.

Recall that Ripple’s cross-border token was among the few with notable gains on Saturday evening while the rest of the market stood silently. Many traders might have anticipated a short-term correction due to XRP’s divergence from the pack, which indeed occurred to the current levels. The question now remains whether the cryptocurrency will remain above the aforementioned support or that was just the start of a broader correction. A lot of $XRP shorts were opened at $2.60, creating a substantial liquidation zone that market makers may try to grab. pic.twitter.com/cPIPwSjLEI — Ali (@ali_charts) January 12, 2025 The post 2 Metrics Indicate Ripple (XRP) Price Faces Trouble After Recent Surge to $2.60 appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-12 09:12:47

The report, published on January 10, highlights the interaction between the country’s cryptocurrency policies and its growing appeal as a travel destination, positioning El Salvador as a global hotspot for Bitcoin enthusiasts. The report, shared by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele and the government-backed Bitcoin Office on social media platform X, shows the country’s record-breaking tourism growth. According to Salvadoran authorities, the number of tourists arriving in the country in 2024 is expected to reach 3.9 million, up 22% from the previous year. Related News: The Expert Speaks: Is the US Really About to Sell $6.5 Billion in Bitcoin? The report attributes much of this growth to Bitcoin’s innovative appeal as a fiat currency and its appeal to visitors, particularly from the United States, who want to experience Bitcoin transactions integrated into daily life. Santander’s analysis also links the tourism boom to a sharp drop in crime rates, with just 114 homicides in El Salvador in 2024, a dramatic drop from 6,656 in 2015. The report highlights the economic importance of El Salvador’s tourism growth. In the first half of 2024, tourism is projected to account for 11% of the country’s GDP, outpacing regional rivals such as Costa Rica, where tourism contributes 5% of GDP. *This is not investment advice.

On-chain data shows investors making large deposits into ETH 2.0 staking contracts. Has ETH price formed a market bottom? Ethereum (ETH) Price Gains 4% as Market Sell-off Wanes Ethereum (ETH) experienced a volatile week, reflecting the broader crypto market dynamics. The recent turbulence was fueled by macroeconomic concerns and the ongoing effects of market-wide liquidations triggered earlier this month. ETH price dropped by 10% between January 6 and January 9, falling from $3,150 to $2,835 as investors reacted to heightened uncertainty. The broader crypto sell-off was exacerbated by liquidity concerns, which intensified bearish sentiment across major altcoins. Ethereum Price Action | ETHUSD However, Ethereum found support near the $2,850 mark on January 10, as selling pressure eased and on-chain activity indicated a shift in sentiment. Investors began making significant deposits into ETH 2.0 staking contracts, reflecting renewed confidence in the network’s long-term potential. As of January 12, ETH has rebounded 4%, climbing back to $3,220. This recovery hints at the formation of a local bottom, with traders now closely monitoring key resistance levels and potential catalysts for further upward momentum. Ethereum 2.0 Staking Inflows Surge By $175 Million in 3 Days Ethereum’s rebound above $3,200 has fueled optimism that the cryptocurrency may consolidate within the $3,150–$3,400 range in the near term. On-chain data reveals a considerable surge in Ethereum staking deposits, signaling growing confidence among long-term holders and network validators. According to the official data from the Beacon Chain , ETH staking inflows have seen a sharp uptick over since January 9, coinciding with the 4% price rebound. Ethereum Staking Deposits vs. ETH Price | Source: StakingRewards As of January 9, the total staked value stood at 33.84 million ETH. Despite the broader market downturn that saw ETH dip below $3,200 earlier in the week, staking activity intensified. Over the past three days, investors staked an additional 53,000 ETH—valued at approximately $175 million at current prices— bringing the total staked to 33.89million ETH as of January 12. This development offers two key insights into Ethereum’s short-term outlook. Firstly, increased staking cuts down short-term market supply, easing immediate sell-side pressure. Secondly, the increased staking activity signals a shift in investor behavior. Rather than liquidate holdings during the recent market downturn, a significant cohort of ETH holders opted to lock their assets into staking contracts, leveraging passive rewards as a buffer against short-term price volatility. While the broader crypto market sentiment remains cautious, Ethereum’s rising staking deposits, position the asset for a steady consolidation above the $3,200 mark in the coming days. Etheruem Price Forecast: Bulls Set to Hold $3,200 Support Ethereum price prediction paints an optimistic outlook, with staking deposits mopping up excess market supply from last week’s sell-off. From a technical standpoint, ETH is currently trading $3,271, consolidating near its lower Bollinger Band of $3,116, which offers immediate support. Ethereum price forecast (ETHUSD) The Bollinger Bands indicate low volatility as they tighten, signaling a potential breakout ahead, if market sentiment flips positive. However, trading volume remains subdued at 27.72K, and the ADX trending at 20.77, market sentiment remains largely cautious. In essence, weak breakout attempts may struggle to breach the $3,300 resistance. A bullish scenario could materialize if ETH reclaims the $3,419 midline of the Bollinger Bands, with increased volume supporting the uptrend.

In contrast, several altcoins, such as XRP, ADA, and XLM, have posted significant gains over the weekend, while SUI has plunged hard. ADA, XLM, XRP on the Rise As reported on Saturday evening, Ripple’s cross-border token stole the show with a massive surge from $2.33 to $2.5. The asset kept climbing in the following hours and tapped a multi-week peak of $2.6 before correcting slightly to $2.52 now. Cardano’s native token is the other massive gainer from the larger-cap alts. ADA has soared by nearly 9% over the past day and now sits at the coveted resistance level of $1. XLM has also gone on a tear, surging by more than 7% and now trading close to $0.45. In contrast, SUI has dumped by over 3% to $4.82, while TRX, SHIB, and BNB are also slightly in the red. On the other hand, ETH, SOL, DOGE, AVAX, TON, LINK, HBAR, and DOT have marked minor gains over the past 24 hours. The cumulative market capitalization of all crypto assets has remained at essentially the same spot as yesterday at just shy of $3.450 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview. Source: QuantifyCrypto BTC Calms at $94K The primary cryptocurrency had a highly eventful and volatile trading week in which it soared past $102,000 on Tuesday, only to crash by more than ten grand in the next 48 hours. This multi-week low took place on Thursday as BTC came close to breaking below $91,000 and even $90,000. More volatility ensued in the following hours, with a jump toward $96,000 and a rejection that pushed it back to almost $92,000. However, the bulls managed to defend the latter and pushed BTC to $94,000 where it has spent most of the weekend, aside from a brief spike to $95,000. As such, bitcoin’s market cap remains at $1.865 trillion on CG, but its dominance over the alts is down to 54.2%. BTCUSD.

Despite this decline, market sentiment surrounding LINK remains optimistic as analysts and investors anticipate a strong recovery. Many view this pullback as a strategic opportunity for accumulation, with the potential for massive gains later this year. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees $1.4 Billion In Exchange Outflows This Week – Strong Accumulation Trend? Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared a compelling technical analysis on X, highlighting that LINK is currently trading within a falling wedge pattern on the daily timeframe. Falling wedges are often seen as bullish reversal patterns, and a breakout above the descending resistance could signal the start of a substantial upward move. According to Runefelt, once LINK successfully breaks out of this formation, the stage will be set for a massive rally, potentially propelling LINK toward new highs. With Chainlink’s strong fundamentals and growing adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain ecosystems, the current price action could serve as a springboard for significant gains. However, the immediate challenge lies in reclaiming lost ground and pushing above the wedge’s resistance. As the market awaits confirmation of a breakout, LINK’s trajectory in the coming days will be critical for shaping its long-term trend. Chainlink Poised For Recovery After Recent Decline Chainlink has solidified its position as one of the most promising altcoins in this market cycle, standing out in the rapidly growing Real World Assets (RWA) sector. Its innovations and partnerships are driving broader adoption, particularly with a groundbreaking collaboration with XRP. This partnership aims to enhance the functionality and adoption of Ripple USD (RLUSD), a stablecoin designed for decentralized finance (DeFi), making Chainlink a pivotal player in the ecosystem. Related Reading: Whales Buy 470 Million Dogecoin In 48 Hours As Price Tests Crucial Demand Level – Details Renowned investor and analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting that Chainlink is trading within a falling wedge pattern on the daily timeframe. This bullish reversal pattern suggests significant upside potential once LINK breaks above the descending resistance. Runefelt has set an initial price target of $30.94 following the anticipated breakout, signaling a potential start to a larger bull trend for LINK. Beyond its technical setup, Chainlink’s robust fundamentals, including its leadership in Oracle solutions and its expanding influence in DeFi, position it as a top contender for this bull cycle. If LINK follows the bullish thesis laid out by Runefelt, the $30.94 target could merely mark the beginning of a much larger rally as the altcoin continues to gain traction and push the boundaries of decentralized innovation. Price Analysis: Holding Critical Support At $20 Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $20, a critical level that represents a strong weekly demand zone. Analysts and investors are closely watching this price point, as it holds the potential to determine the short-term trajectory of LINK’s price action. Holding above this key support level is crucial for maintaining bullish momentum. If LINK manages to sustain itself at $20, it sets the stage for a potential rebound toward the $25 mark. Breaching this resistance could trigger a broader rally, potentially propelling LINK to multi-year highs as market sentiment shifts in its favor. However, the stakes are high. A break below the $20 demand zone could lead to a deeper correction, with prices likely revisiting the $16 level. Such a move might shake investor confidence in the short term but could also create new opportunities for accumulation as LINK establishes fresh support.

The scheme involved scammers sending text messages promising flexible, high-paying jobs. Victims were instructed to create cryptocurrency accounts, deposit funds, and participate in product reviews on fraudulent websites designed to mimic legitimate businesses. Scammers Deceived Victims with Promises of ‘Legitimizing’ Data According to James, the perpetrators assured victims that their deposited funds were merely for “legitimizing” data and that they would not be purchasing any products. In exchange, participants were promised full refunds and commissions. However, the victims never received any compensation, losing their money instead. “Scammers sent messages offering good-paying, flexible jobs, only to manipulate victims into buying cryptocurrency and stealing it from them,” James stated on January 9 . With the help of the U.S. Secret Service, authorities have frozen the stolen cryptocurrency. James urged the public to remain vigilant about unsolicited job offers, especially those received via text messages from unknown senders. “Preying on New Yorkers trying to support their families with remote work opportunities is cruel and unacceptable,” James added.

The FBI reported that scammers often contact potential victims through unsolicited calls or messages, offering seemingly simple tasks like restaurant reviews or service optimization. Victims are typically asked to make cryptocurrency payments to access more work, with the money ending up in the scammers’ hands. “You are directed to make cryptocurrency payments to your employer as part of the job,” the FBI cautioned. California Resident Sues 3 Asia-Based Banks for Failing to Prevent Crypto Scam Last week, a California resident filed a lawsuit against three Asia-based banks, accusing them of negligence in preventing a cryptocurrency scam that led to a loss of nearly $1 million. The legal action claimed that the banks failed to perform essential due diligence, allowing fraudsters to deceive the victim over several months. The plaintiff, Ken Liem, alleges that he became a target of a “pig butchering” scam after being contacted on LinkedIn in June 2023 by individuals posing as representatives of a lucrative cryptocurrency investment opportunity. As reported, the crypto industry witnessed losses totaling $1.49 billion in 2024 due to hacks and fraud, marking a 17% decrease from 2023. According to a report by blockchain security platform Immunefi, hacks were overwhelmingly the primary cause, accounting for $1.47 billion or 98.1% of the total losses across 192 incidents. Fraud, including rug pulls and scams, represented just 1.9% of the losses at $28 million, though this category saw a 72% increase year-on-year. The decline in total crypto losses reflects improved security measures, as the number of successful attacks also fell by 27.5%, from 320 in 2023 to 232 in 2024.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says his now-infamous tariff threats are pushing long-term interest rates higher worldwide. Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s Managing Director, called the situation “very unusual” during a press conference. Short-term rates are going down, which doesn’t typically happen at the same time as a global spike in long-term borrowing costs. Blame it on Trump’s second-term trade policy promises, she says. This guy has made it clear that he’s gonna go after imports from China, Mexico, Canada, and anyone else he considers an economic rival—or ally, for that matter actually. The IMF is so mad at him right now. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, their Chief Economist, warned back in October that trade wars and uncertainty could chop 0.5% off global output. He told Trump directly that he would drag America and everyone else down. We think it’s safe to assume that Trump is not gonna listen. Markets freak out as Trump haunts Meanwhile, bond yields are climbing everywhere, and the US dollar is on a rampage. Investors are spooked, and they’re bracing for what Trump’s second term could bring. Georgieva says medium-sized economies, Asia, and emerging markets are going to feel the pain the most. “The greenback’s strength could fuel higher funding costs for emerging-market economies and especially for low-income countries,” she explained. Here’s the thing though: this economic turbulence comes while the global economy is already limping. Since the pandemic, the IMF has been warning that growth isn’t great. Back in October, they predicted the global economy would expand by 3.2% in 2025. Don’t expect a major update on January 17 when the next forecast is released. Sorry, but Georgieva has already said that the number will stay about the same. Still though, there’s a lot happening under the hood. The US is outperforming expectations, while the European Union is losing steam. India is dragging a little, and China is stuck in a mess of low demand and deflation. In the middle of all this, the Federal Reserve is in a weird spot. December jobs data was stronger than expected, flipping rate-cut predictions on their head. Bank of America has completely scrapped its forecast for rate cuts, saying hikes might even be on the table if inflation doesn’t stay in check. Citigroup is still clinging to hopes for rate cuts, but even they’ve pushed the timeline to later in the year. Georgieva thinks the Fed has room to wait it out. Meanwhile, traders are already adjusting. Interest rate cut bets are shrinking fast. Markets are now pricing in just 30 basis points of reductions through the end of 2025, with any movement likely happening closer to September instead of mid-year. Europe braces for another Trump storm Over in Europe, leaders are on edge. The European Union isn’t taking Trump’s tariff threats lightly, and officials are openly preparing for a trade war. Stephane Sejourne, their industry chief, says the bloc has both defensive and offensive tools ready to protect its industries. “Markets are increasingly protective, with aid making our industries uncompetitive,” he said. He added, “This marks the end of European complacency.” Translation: If Trump follows through on tariffs, the EU plans to fight back. They’ve been here before. In 2018, Trump slapped European steel and aluminum with tariffs. The EU didn’t sit around—they hit back with duties on politically sensitive American products like Harley-Davidson motorcycles and Levi Strauss & Co. jeans. “We have everything to lose from a collective trade war,” Sejourne admitted, but that doesn’t mean they’re rolling over. Since Trump’s first election win in 2016, the EU has bulked up its trade defense playbook. They now have measures in place to counter economic coercion, and they’re ready to use them. “I’m prepared to explore both defensive and offensive actions with my colleagues,” Sejourne said. Europe’s strategy includes potential tariffs on US imports and financial aid for European businesses that might get caught in the crossfire.

The scammer posted a fraudulent message, riddled with grammatical errors, claiming “LTC is now in Solana.” The post included a dubious contract address and a link to “pump.fun,” which directed unsuspecting users to the scam token. The Litecoin team acted swiftly, regaining control of the account and confirming in an update that the breach occurred due to a compromised delegated account. The compromised access point has since been removed to prevent further incidents. This hack is the latest in a troubling pattern of similar attacks targeting prominent accounts on X . These breaches exploit the accounts’ credibility to promote fake tokens or phishing links designed to steal funds and sensitive user data. A String of X Account Hacks The Litecoin incident is not isolated. Over recent months, multiple high-profile X account profiles have been hijacked for fraudulent schemes. In October, EigenLayer, a restaking protocol, saw its X account hacked, leading to the promotion of a fake “Season 2 Stakedrop” campaign. The hacker disseminated malicious links claiming to reallocate EIGEN tokens before the EigenLayer team regained access to the account. November brought another headline-grabbing hack, this time targeting rapper Wiz Khalifa’s account . The attacker used the platform to advertise a fake memecoin called “WIZ,” falsely linking it to the artist. December proved particularly active for cybercriminals. On December 8, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was breached, with a hacker pushing a fake token, “ADAsol.” The scam falsely claimed Cardano would cease supporting ADA due to an SEC lawsuit. Before the scam unraveled, “ADAsol” generated $500,000 in trading volume, only to crash in value by over 99%. Later that month, Yat Siu, co-founder of Animoca Brands, had his account hacked to promote another fraudulent token on the Solana network. Need of Heightened Vigilance These incidents underscore the growing threat of social media-based scams in the crypto sector. For users, heightened vigilance is essential. Avoid engaging with unverified posts, double-check URLs, and stay informed about security updates from official accounts. As hackers increasingly exploit the trust associated with prominent profiles, platforms like X face mounting pressure to bolster their security measures and restore user confidence.

Roman Vitalyevich Ostapenko and Alexander Evgenievich Oleynik, who were arrested last month, face charges of laundering criminal proceeds, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced on Friday . A third individual, Anton Vyachlavovich Tarasov, remains at large, according to the DOJ. Authorities Dismantle Infrastructure of the Crypto Mixers Authorities have already seized and dismantled the infrastructure supporting the two crypto mixers. Blender.io, previously sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department, was accused of helping North Korean hackers launder funds from cyber thefts. These sanctions marked the Treasury’s first action against a crypto mixing service—a tool designed to obscure digital transactions and erase public traces of cryptocurrency transfers. “According to the indictment, the defendants operated cryptocurrency ‘mixers’ that served as safe havens for laundering criminally derived funds, including proceeds from ransomware and wire fraud,” stated Brent S. Wible, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the DOJ’s Criminal Division. He added that these mixers facilitated state-sponsored hacking groups and cybercriminals in profiting from crimes that endangered public safety and national security. Roman Vitalyevich Ostapenko, Alexander Evgenievich Oleynik, and Anton Vyachlavovich Tarasov have been indicted for their involvement in operating the cryptocurrency mixing services https://t.co/O6QYURWB4g and https://t.co/FLvAVVCnft . https://t.co/DTnjHpDQLC pic.twitter.com/jT5Wvu88pC — US Attorney NDGA (@NDGAnews) January 10, 2025 Crypto mixers, controversial for their dual use in financial privacy and criminal activity, have sparked heated debates among U.S. policymakers. In a related case, the Treasury’s sanctions against Tornado Cash were overturned in November by a federal appeals court, which ruled that the underlying technology cannot be sanctioned. However, criminal charges against Tornado Cash’s founders are ongoing. Blender.io operated from 2018 until its takedown in 2022, after which Sinbad.io emerged as its successor. Sinbad.io has since faced similar sanctions from the Treasury for aiding illicit activities. The case underscores the ongoing crackdown on crypto services exploited for illegal purposes. Crypto Firm Co-Founder Pleads Guilty to $9M Wire Fraud Scheme Travis Ford, co-founder and head trader of Wolf Capital, has pleaded guilty to charges of wire fraud conspiracy after orchestrating a scheme that defrauded investors out of $9.4 million. Ford marketed himself as a “sophisticated investor” capable of delivering daily returns of 1-2%, amounting to an astonishing 547% annually. Ford used Wolf Capital’s website, social media, and other online platforms to lure investors between January and August 2023. However, instead of utilizing the funds as promised, Ford redirected the money for personal gain, enriching himself and his co-conspirators. The DOJ stated that Ford “misappropriated and diverted investor funds to benefit himself and his co-conspirators, to the financial detriment of investors.” The case is part of a broader crackdown on fraudulent crypto schemes. On January 5, Vietnamese authorities arrested four individuals accused of running a crypto mining scam that defrauded over 200 victims of nearly $157,300.

Ryan Watkins, a co-founder at digital asset investment firm Syncracy Capital, says on the social media platform X that he believes crypto patterns such as the four-year cycle and altcoin season are becoming a thing of the past. According to Watkins, the digital asset market has changed with the emergence of crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), projects proving their market fit and use case and an upcoming US administration that supports the industry. “Think most people would be better off deleting the words ‘cycle’ and ‘alt season’ from their vocabulary. Although crypto will continue to ebb and flow, it is a fundamentally different game now, with shifting market structure, maturing projects, and a new regulatory paradigm. There will continue to be easier periods than others, and speculative booms at sector levels throughout, but oversimplified models from the past are becoming less relevant by the day.” Watkins believes the changes will lead to an extended crypto bull market that tests investors’ patience. “Before the next extended bear market, higher than many expect, but takes longer to get there than most expect. Current Twitter sentiment is overly dramatic.” He also thinks that the explosion in the number of coins trading in the market is a net positive for the industry. According to Watkins, the condition will force market participants to be judicious in their investments in order to make gains. “Dispersion is good. As the asset class matures, it will be harder to make ridiculous multiples buying ridiculous assets, that in many cases only made money because it was all so early. Active management will be paramount as dispersion continues and the opportunity shifts beyond BTC.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The proposal, submitted on behalf of Peck’s family shares, aims to encourage Meta to re-evaluate its asset allocation strategy and consider Bitcoin as a potential inflation-proof asset. The proposal highlights Meta’s significant cash reserves and potential vulnerability to inflation. As of September 30, 2024, Meta had total assets of $256 billion, of which $72 billion was divided into cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The proposal argues that these assets have diminished in value due to inflation and low bond yields, and have the potential to erode shareholder value over time. To counter this, Peck suggests Meta consider reallocating some of its cash and bonds to Bitcoin, citing the cryptocurrency’s fixed supply and historical performance as a hedge against inflation. Related News: The Reason For The Decline In Altcoin, Which Has Fallen Very Big Today, Has Become Clear - Recently Listed on Binance Futures Key data points highlighted in the proposal include: Bitcoin's price has significantly outperformed bonds, rising 124% in the past year and 1,265% in the past five years. BlackRock, Meta’s second-largest institutional shareholder, has deemed a 2% Bitcoin allocation for portfolios reasonable, providing a potential framework for Meta to follow. Companies like MicroStrategy have adopted Bitcoin into their treasuries and have seen their shares outperform Meta’s by 2,191% over the past five years. The proposal cites Meta’s culture of innovation, highlighting the company’s history of pioneering technological trends. It also highlights the Bitcoin-related connections within Meta’s leadership: CEO Mark Zuckerberg named his goats “Bitcoin” and “Max.” Marc Andreessen, a board member who praised Bitcoin, is also an executive at Coinbase. Peck argues that Meta's leadership needs to align its corporate treasury strategy with the forward-thinking approaches they likely use in their personal financial decisions. The resolution calls on the Meta Board of Directors to conduct a formal assessment to assess whether adding Bitcoin to the company's treasury would be in the best interests of shareholders. Meta has yet to publicly respond to the proposal. *This is not investment advice.

According to the pundit, the PEPE price might be preparing for a rebound back to its former highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Outflows Hits 2-Month High With $1.4 Billion Withdrawn, What This Means This prediction is based on the Tom Demark “TD” Sequential buy signal for the third-largest meme coin on its 12-hour price chart. The Tom Demark Sequential is an indicator used in technical analysis to identify the exact time of trend exhaustion and price reversal for any specific cryptocurrency. Typically, this technical analysis indicator comprises two phases: the TD Setup (or the momentum phase) and the TD Countdown (or the trend exhaustion phase). The TD Setup phase occurs after a price reversal and comprises a 9-candle count (of the same polarity). The TD Countdown phase, on the other hand, is valid only after the Setup phase has been established and consists of 13 candles. According to Martinez, the TD Sequential indicator flashed a sell signal (specifically after the completion of the Setup phase) for the price of Pepe on January 4, 2025. This was followed by a 24% correction, as the meme token’s value declined to around 0.0000167 by January 9. Similarly, Martinez revealed that the TD Sequential has flashed another signal, but a bullish one this time around. According to the crypto analyst, if this alarm holds, PEPE could see its price rebound to between $0.0000185 and $0.0000191. This represents an almost 10% surge from the current price point. PEPE Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Pepe stands at around $0.000019, reflecting an almost 2% jump in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the third-largest meme coin is down by roughly 15% in the past seven days. Related Reading: Cardano Price Shows Signs Of Recovery — Is A Return To $1 Inevitable?

This level of dominance, reported by CryptoQuant contributor Burakkesmeci in a January 11 analysis, reflects growing retail interest and also hints at the potential for a robust bull market in 2025. Altcoin Trading Momentum Builds The report highlights that Binance’s altcoin trading volume dominance increased by 11% over the past five months, reaching 77.83% this January. According to Burakkesmeci, this trend signals increasing confidence in altcoins, with consistent growth since May 2024, when dominance stood at 50.80%. “Retail activity is picking up, and the momentum is likely to sustain over the coming months,” Burakkesmeci noted. However, while the data on Binance points to a bullish outlook, the broader market offers mixed signals. CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index reads 46 out of 100, also indicating a tilt toward “Bitcoin Season.” Traders generally look for a drop in Bitcoin Dominance as an early sign of an altcoin rally. Currently, Bitcoin Dominance stands at 57.74% , showing a modest 2.41% increase over the past month, as per TradingView data . Ether’s Role in Altcoin Upside Prominent market voices are keeping a close eye on Ether (ETH), which they see as a potential driver for the next altcoin season . Pseudonymous trader Mister Crypto, in a January 11 X post, predicted that Ether could see a price surge from $4,000 to $8,000 in the coming weeks. A strong rally in Ether often precedes a broader market boom, giving traders hope for a major upside. Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise Invest, expressed optimism for the entire crypto market, stating he is “fired up” about the advances Bitcoin and crypto could make this year. However, some analysts caution that the dynamics of this cycle may differ from past ones. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, suggested that only select altcoin projects with clear use cases and strong narratives might thrive in the current landscape. Ju emphasized that the days of altcoin season being fueled by capital rotation from Bitcoin are over, reflecting a maturing market.

According to reports, the pastor took the funds from church members and others under the premise of helping them invest in risk-free cryptocurrency investments. According to court documents, the pastor, Francier Obando Pinilo promised his victims returns as high as 40% monthly. The pastor, who oversees the Tiempo de Poder Church in Pasco, said he will invest the funds in his crypto business, Solano Fi. However, court documents show that he diverted the funds into accounts belonging to him and his co-schemers instead. Washington pastor docked for crypto investment scam According to reports , Pinilo was apprehended at his home in Miami on December 5, after the United States Eastern Washington District Court indicted him. He was charged with 25 counts of wire fraud and one count of running an illegal money-transmitting business. His church, which operates out of two locations in Pasco, has ceased operations, with Pinilo taking to Facebook to make church-related posts. The accused pastor appeared at the Richland US Courthouse in the Federal Building in connection to the case on Thursday. If the judge finds him guilty of the offenses, Pinilo could spend up to 20 years, the maximum sentence that fraud charges carry, in jail. In addition, Pinilo will answer to the Commodity Trading Commission, after the regulator filed a civil lawsuit against him. The commission has the blessing of Congress to regulate and enforce commodity exchanges. Pinilo scammed victims with fake investment promises According to the filing, Pinilo carried out his alleged acts between November 2021 and October 2023, targeting several people in addition to members of his church. He specifically targeted people with little understanding of the crypto industry. In addition, he pitched his investment ideas to church members who did not know the type of investments he was going to carry out. His publications were in Spanish, telling victims that the investments included commodity trading. The civil lawsuit claimed he used a cover of honesty and trustworthiness to scam unsuspecting people including worshippers at other churches. “As the pastor at his church in Pasco, Wash., and as a guest speaker at other churches, the defendant (Pinillo) was able to reach a vast number of potential customers, who believed he was honest and trustworthy,” the filing read. At an event where he was a guest pastor, the Washington pastor preached on the benefits of the congregation lifting themselves out of poverty before pitching his idea. He told worshippers they could earn an interest as high as 34.9% monthly on their investments. Aside from churches, he also solicited investments at several public gatherings which were usually held at the Conference Center or the Pasco Red Lion Hotel. He pitched his investments on Facebook and opened a Telegram group where he had about 1,500 users. Investigations uncovered lies about Solano Fi According to court documents, Solano Fi did not have any investment or trading programs. Rather, it found that Pinilo fabricated online account statements to show profits. The fabricated statements were then given to investors to lure them into parting with their funds. The court documents also revealed that participants were rewarded based on how many people they recruited. In addition, some earlier investors were rewarded, with documents noting that the Washington pastor ran the program like a Ponzi scheme . However, issues started when new members started making withdrawal requests. The Washington pastor would give them excuses instead of their funds. His excuses ranged from lying about the crypto market drop to website downtime, while at other times, he told investors to recruit new members to buy out their accounts. The documents also alleged that he asked customers to send funds to repair the platform’s system so they could get their funds. Reacting to the update, the United States Attorney for the Eastern Washington District, Vanessa Waldref criticized the increase in crypto investment scams. “Fraudulent investment schemes are not new, but cryptocurrency scams are a new way fraudsters take money from hardworking, honest people,” she said. She highlighted that it presents new challenges for law enforcement, as these criminals move stolen funds to international accounts.

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 11:34:11

Bearish Crowd Suggests So,https://cryptopotato.com/is-bitcoin-poised-for-a-100k-rebound-bearish-crowd-suggests-so/,"The price actions for BTC in the past week or so were nothing short of a full-on rollercoaster, and the volatile ride is expected to continue in the following days, especially with Trump’s inauguration just around the corner. With bitcoin losing a substantial chunk of its weekly gains, the crowd has expectedly turned bearish. However, that could be a blessing in disguise. Bears Are Back Upon MicroStrategy’s Monday announcement about its latest BTC purchase, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap skyrocketed to over $100,000 and beyond $102,000 for the first time this year. However, that relief rally was short-lived and the asset slumped hard in the following days, dumping by more than ten grand at one point without 48 hours. The culmination came on Thursday when bitcoin dumped to $91,250 (on Bitstamp), which became its lowest price level since late November 2024. The bulls finally intercepted the nosedive at this point and didn’t allow a further decline below $90,000 despite multiple warnings by prominent analysts. Naturally, the crowd turned bearish following such a massive crash, with the Fear and Greed Index going back to neutral on Friday for the first time since October. Such fluctuations for the metric typically showcase a big move in either direction and suggest an upcoming move in the opposite. Crypto Fear and Greed Index. Source: alternative.me Is That Good News? The crypto analytics resource Santiment has frequently suggested that BTC tends to move in the opposite direction of the crowd’s expectations. This means that in times of uncertainty similar to now when retail is going bearish on social media, the cryptocurrency proves them wrong with a notable price surge and vice versa. Such was the case in early December 2024 when bitcoin tumbled again from over $100,000 toward $90,000. In the following weeks, though, the asset reversed its trajectory and even registered a new all-time high of over $108,000 on December 17. Consequently, Santiment suggested that the latest developments could be another hidden bullish sign, especially if the crowd remains this pessimistic. Crypto has been a slight let down for traders over the past week, and we have been seeing higher than usual mentions of selling interest.

Polygon price prediction for 2025 expects the price of MATIC to surge toward $1.57. By 2030, we expect the MATIC price to record a maximum price of $10.51. Polygon, an Ethereum side chain and layer two scaling solution, has experienced substantial uptake by enterprises and industries in the last year.

However, if MATIC’s price successfully breaks above $0.5414, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.6767. MATIC/USDT Chart If bulls cannot initiate a surge, MATIC’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.4122, resulting in a correction to $0.3435. Is MATIC a good investment? MATIC token can be a good investment option in the long run as the project develops a roadmap for its Polygon 2.0 version. Polygon collaborates with diverse industries to enhance adoption, focusing on NFT solutions and Ethereum scalability. Partnerships include Starbucks for an NFT loyalty program and collaborations with Adidas, Prada, and Disney to develop NFT offerings. Why is Matic price down today? Following a sell off around $0.53, MATIC’s price failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a break below immediate Fib channels. Will MATIC price touch $1? Yes, Matic price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2025. However, this depends on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will MATIC Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and MATIC gains regulatory recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2030. Is MATIC a good long-term investment? As Polygon continues to expand its offerings, it gains a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, MATIC can be a good long-term investment option. Recent news/ Opinions on MATIC The Aave community is considering ending its operations on Polygon due to concerns about an upcoming review of the risk profile for bridged assets. A proposal on Dec. 13 by Aave founder Marc Zeller suggests reassessing risk parameters for Aave v2 and v3 on Polygon. MATIC price prediction January 2025 Following Donald Trump’s election victory, the crypto market witnessed a robust price surge. As a result, the altcoin market skyrocketed, resulting in a bull run in the Polygon price. However, analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices following a bearish December. We expect MATIC to record a minimum price of $0.57 and a maximum price of $0.72, with an average of $0.6 in January. MATIC Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high MATIC Price Prediction January 2025 $0.57 $0.6 $0.72 MATIC price prediction 2025 Ethereum fees increase dramatically during a bull market, making it too expensive for regular cryptocurrency users. That’s why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $1.34. It’s anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year.

Over 38,000 acres—an area 2.5 times the size of Manhattan—have already been scorched, and the destruction keeps growing. The numbers are mind-bending. Estimated damages have climbed to $150 billion, the highest ever recorded for a wildfire in America. Just 24 hours ago, experts put the damage at $50 billion. Now, AccuWeather’s new estimate triples that figure. Over 10,000 structures have been destroyed, and rebuilding those homes and businesses is expected to take more than a decade. Financial damage caused by wildfires in the United States. Source: TKL This makes the 2018 Camp Fire, which caused $12.5 billion in damages (adjusted for today’s dollars), look like child’s play. The LA wildfires are twelve times more expensive, and the total cost is still climbing. If the fires rage on, the final figure could push past Hurricane Katrina’s $200 billion bill, making this the most expensive disaster in U.S. history. Not a great record to break, we’d wager. A financial punch that stings worldwide Let’s put this $150 billion into perspective. It’s more than the GDP of 58 countries. That’s right—this wildfire has done more economic damage than most economies produce in an entire year. To get even more specific, the $150 billion is more than half the GDP of Finland and a third of Singapore’s GDP. Insurance companies saw some of this coming, and a lot of homeowners are paying the price for it—literally. In the Pacific Palisades, 69% of homeowners lost their insurance policies before the fires even started. Back in July, State Farm canceled 1,600 policies in the area. Other insurers also bailed, leaving thousands with no choice but to rely on California’s FAIR Plan, the high-risk insurance safety net. Now, losses to the FAIR Plan are expected to hit $24 billion. Areas in California that lost their State Farm insurance before the wildfires. Source: TKL JPMorgan estimates that insured damages will total $20 billion. But while some insurers backed out early, others stayed in and underestimated the risk. This is shaping up to be the biggest test the insurance market has ever faced. Reliance on the FAIR Plan skyrocketed last year. The Pacific Palisades saw an 85% jump in FAIR Plan usage compared to 2023, far above the 40% average increase in California ZIP codes. This reliance is stretching California’s finances thin. The state is facing a massive, years-long burden, as fires continue to rip through some of its most valuable real estate. The Palisades fire burned through a ZIP code where the average home costs over $3 million. The Eaton fire, raging east of Los Angeles, also tore through high-value neighborhoods. Lives lost in the chaos The human toll is equally grim. So far, 16 deaths have been confirmed, but the final count won’t be clear until investigators can access neighborhoods still plagued by downed power lines and gas leaks. Among the dead are an amputee and his son with cerebral palsy, who were found together in their home. Areas using the FAIR Plan across California. Source: TKL Another victim stayed behind to fight the fire engulfing the house he had lived in for over 50 years. An 85-year-old woman refused to leave her pets behind as the Palisades fire closed in. She didn’t survive. A former Australian child star and a Malibu surfer described as a “magnet for people” also lost their lives. Of the confirmed deaths, five are tied to the Palisades fire near the coast, and six to the Eaton fire. Officials warn that the numbers could rise significantly. Economic ripple effects Estimated damages now account for about 0.55% of the entire U.S. GDP. This disaster is also exposing gaps in U.S. disaster response policies, as billions of dollars in federal aid will likely be needed to support recovery efforts. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has flagged climate change as a growing risk to financial stability. For the U.S., the fires come at a time when the economy is already dealing with high interest rates and lingering inflation. In 2025, GDP growth is forecasted at 2%, a slight downgrade from 2.7% in 2024. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate has dropped to 2.7% from its peak of 9% in 2022, but any more economic shocks will derail progress. The Federal Reserve has tried to stabilize the economy, but the cost of disasters like these could force policymakers to rethink their strategies. Rebuilding efforts will likely require massive government spending, adding pressure to the national debt and President Donald Trump. Poor guy had dreams of cutting down spending. The labor market, while stable with a 4.2% unemployment rate, could face challenges as thousands of Californians lose jobs due to the fires. Rebuilding will create opportunities, but they won’t come fast enough for those already struggling.

38837654,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=674270,1736682629,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Trump’s inauguratie: gaan bekende crypto’s stijgen of start nieuwe crypto crash?,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/trumps-inauguratie-gaan-bekende-cryptos-stijgen-of-start-nieuwe-crypto-crash/,"Volgende week maandag, 20 januari, neemt Donald Trump opnieuw plaats in het Witte Huis. Volgens velen is dit positief voor de crypto markt, maar er wordt ook gespeculeerd over een nieuwe crypto crash op de dag zelf. Dit komt door een groot aantal short-term holders die mogelijk uit paniek verkopen als BTC te ver daalt. Aan de andere kant is de inauguratie van Trump een positieve factor voor de crypto markt. Trump kan als president belangrijke veranderingen maken in het regulatoire klimaat in de VS, maar ook heeft hij mogelijk plannen voor een Bitcoin reserve. Dit kan zorgen voor directe en indirecte koopdruk, die Bitcoin naar een nieuw niveau zou tillen. Dreiging voor nieuwe crypto crash Gebaseerd op de Short-Term Cost Basis is het niveau van $88k (lichtblauw) een belangrijke om te verdedigen. Aan het begin van de middag ligt de Bitcoin koers nog redelijk stabiel op $93.900. Mocht hij onder $88k dalen, dan is het mogelijk dat short-term holders uit paniek verkopen. Zo’n scenario kan leiden tot een domino-effect, waarin de koers steeds lager gaat, doordat meer mensen uit paniek verkopen. Uiteraard wordt de koers uiteindelijk opgevangen door een stijgende koopdruk. Aan de andere kant is een grote crypto rally mogelijk als de Bitcoin koers boven $88k blijft na de inauguratie van Trump op 20 januari. Hoe snel de interesse in crypto vanaf dat moment zal groeien is nog een verrassing, maar het is genoeg om Bitcoin naar een nieuwe all-time high boven $108.300 te tillen. Een ander scenario is dat investeerders en traders in de aanloop naar 20 januari massaal investeren, waardoor bekende crypto’s stijgen vóór de 20e. Als dit gebeurt, blijf dan op de hoede voor een mogelijke ‘sell-the-news’, die op 20 januari of in de opvolgende dagen kan zorgen voor een crypto crash. Gaat Bitcoin dalen naar $88k in crypto crash? Op het moment is het erg onwaarschijnlijk dat de Bitcoin koers onder $88k gaat dalen in de aanloop naar 20 januari. Sinds zijn stijging boven $90k in november 2024, is de bekende cryptomunt nog geen enkele keer onder dit niveau gezakt. Het sterke support rond $90k maakt een daling onder $88k erg lastig op korte termijn. Bitcoin heeft op hetzelfde moment te maken met een sterke resistance rond $97.300, gevormd door zijn 30-daagse moving average (geel). Een andere sterke resistance is te zien rond $102k. Deze resistance zorgde vorige week maandag voor een significante daling. Ook de Relative Strength Index (RSI) van 45 maakt een scherpe daling onwaarschijnlijk. De RSI geeft aan dat het momentum neutraal is met een lichte bearish tint, dit betekent dat BTC niet wordt beschouwd als overgewaardeerd op het moment. Tenzij het sentiment van de markt bearish wordt, lijkt het erop dat crypto gaat stijgen. Combineer dit met de mogelijkheid dat de markt zeer positief reageert op de inauguratie van Trump en de komende weken kunnen zeer winstgevend worden voor investeerders. Cryptocurrency is riskant, maar om de komende weken geen crypto te hebben, is in zekere zin ook riskant. Mogelijk zorgt Trump voor een grote rally zonder crash en zien we de levels van vandaag voorlopig niet meer terug. Welke altcoins gaan stijgen in volgende crypto rally? Bitcoin en grote altcoins kunnen de komende weken veel aandacht krijgen en significant stijgen. Als we echter kijken naar kleinere altcoins, kunnen deze nog harder stijgen als ze worden opgepakt door investeerders. Hieronder kijken we naar 3 kleine crypto’s met potentie om te exploderen in het eerste kwartaal van 2025. Kleine altcoins dragen uiteraard meer risico dan Bitcoin en bekende crypto’s, maar kunnen hierdoor ook veel harder stijgen als alles goed gaat. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is een van de meest populaire crypto presales van het moment en heeft al $46,5 miljoen opgehaald sinds zijn lancering in december.

According to Alan Santana, XRP is showing potential for a higher shift, having broken above a descending trendline after weeks of consolidation following its December 2024 peak, as indicated in his TradingView post on January 12. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Alan Santana Santana’s outlook noted that after a sharp bullish rally late last year, inspired by post-election optimism, XRP entered a retracement phase that evolved into a consolidation pattern. This pattern, often considered a 50/50 scenario where price action can break up or down, has now decisively favored the bulls. He added that broader market conditions in 2025, particularly in this post- Bitcoin -halving year, have created an overwhelmingly bullish environment for cryptocurrencies , tipping the odds in favor of upward momentum. XRP price levels to watch The expert noted that the short-term bullish momentum is a critical development, as it confirms bullish dominance and sets XRP on course to retest significant price levels. The first target for XRP is $2.70, a retest of its last major high. Should the bullish momentum persist, Santana anticipates that $2.90 could also come into play. Ultimately, this target may push the asset to the coveted $3 mark. “The break of the pattern upper resistance indicates an advance to the last high, that is a minimum of $2.7. This can go higher and $2.9 be challenged. A bullish breakout is now confirmed,” the expert stated. On the other hand, for the possibility of new all-time highs, an analysis by Cryptoinsightuk in an X post on January 12 highlighted $2.61 as the critical price to watch. If XRP closes above this level, its upward trajectory could solidify. Such a close would signal sustained bullish sentiment and strengthen the case for further gains in the coming weeks. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView At the same time, as reported by Finbold, another pseudonymous analyst, The Great Mattsby , projected that XRP was ‘just days away’ from another record-high breakout. This projection is based on XRP’s short-term technical strength. Indeed, this bullish outlook is backed by token whales accumulating XRP, a significant development for the Ripple-affiliated asset. XRP also faces several bullish fundamentals that are likely to spur price growth. For instance, the community is anticipating the conclusion of the long-standing legal tussle between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). This expectation has heightened due to President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of crypto-friendly Paul Atkins to replace outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler . Additionally, there is a growing expectation that the new SEC administration will likely consider approving a spot XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). In this line, Nate Geraci, an ETF analyst, has projected that the product will likely be approved this year. My 10 crypto-related ETF predictions for 2025… https://t.co/uDj1OCkaVQ pic.twitter.com/ye3zA2sinV — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) January 11, 2025 This optimism follows Ripple President Monica Long’s statement that XRP could be next in line for a spot ETF approval amid pending applications from firms like WisdomTree, Bitwise, Canary Capital, and 21Shares. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.48, having gained over 4% in the last 24 hours, while on the weekly chart, the asset has risen nearly 6%. These short-term gains are noteworthy, as they emerged during a bearish sentiment in the general market. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold XRP is maintaining a strong position above its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) price of $2.15 and its 200-day SMA of $0.97, signaling a robust uptrend. For XRP to sustain its current momentum, investors need to monitor how the asset interacts with the $2.50 level. Sustained gains above this mark could signal a continued uptrend, while failure to hold above it might suggest a reversal.

The scheme, which promised flexible, high-paying positions, instead duped individuals into buying crypto that was ultimately stolen. Fake Remote Jobs Target Vulnerable Workers In a January 9 statement , James revealed how scammers lured victims through text messages, offering opportunities to work as product reviewers. Victims were instructed to create cryptocurrency accounts, deposit funds, and review items listed on fraudulent websites designed to mimic legitimate brands. To make the process seem credible, scams victims were told their deposited crypto would remain untouched and only serve to “legitimize” the data they were providing. They were assured their funds, along with a commission, would be returned after the task was completed. However, the funds were stolen, and the promised payouts never materialized. “Deceiving New Yorkers who are simply trying to earn an honest living to support their families is cruel and unacceptable,” James stated. With assistance from the U.S. Secret Service, the stolen cryptocurrency has been frozen, offering a glimmer of hope for the victims . James also urged caution against unsolicited text messages claiming to offer job opportunities, emphasizing the importance of verifying such claims. Work-From-Home Scams This case echoes a broader warning issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in June 2024 about the rise of work-from-home job scams. The FBI noted that scammers often reach out to potential victims through unsolicited calls or messages, offering seemingly simple tasks such as rating services or optimizing online platforms. In a pattern similar to the New York scam, victims were told to make cryptocurrency payments to unlock additional tasks or access their earnings. These payments, however, went straight to the scammers, leaving victims financially devastated. The FBI cautioned, “If you are directed to make cryptocurrency payments to your employer as part of a job, it’s likely a scam.” The New York AG’s case sheds light on the evolving tactics of crypto scammers and highlights the importance of public vigilance.

Pepe Rescues Trump (PEPERTRU), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPERTRU is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Rescues Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Rescues Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Rescues Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Rescues Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Rescues Trump by entering its contract address – HtgdKmNDff2UgXmmJYCryKhjVE2F89XMncNt8oThipHz – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPERTRU.

With the recent surge, XRP has outperformed other tokens in the short term, seeing a 10% surge over the last day. Its market capitalization has also gone up to around $146 billion. The milestone has also seen the asset reclaim its place as the third-largest asset in the crypto market, displacing Tether’s USDT. XRP is not following the broader market bearish trend, with Bitcoin seeing a 4% decline in the past week. Peter Brandt calls XRP the ‘leader of the pack’ According to Peter Brandt’s post on X, he described the digital asset as the “leader of the pack,” sending the XRP community and wider crypto industry into a frenzy. The analyst has always been known to be an XRP skeptic, calling the asset a scam in 2020. He joins a growing list of high-profile analysts who now support the project after initially being against the token in the past. Leader of the pack $XRP pic.twitter.com/mld7fp0vbM — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) January 11, 2025 Peter Brandt also cautioned the XRP community back in August 2024, warning them of a bearish pattern. He went ahead to note that the token would diminish in value against the leading digital asset Bitcoin. Despite his praise for the token, he has told his followers that he does not own the asset and is not planning to invest in it in the future. “I have not been a fan of Ripple. I pointed out the obvious on the chart but I do not own nor plan to own a single XRP,” Peter Brandt said. However, his follow-up post has caused quite a stir in the market, with community members questioning his assessments. While some think it is a genuine reassessment of what the asset stands for, others are still thinking he could go back on his decision not to invest in the asset in the future. The implications of his assessment also mirror the general market sentiment. Crypto experts and analysts have been known to tilt market sentiments with their views. These views, in turn, affect several aspects of an asset, often reflected in trading volume. In the meantime, traders all around the world are preparing for a shift in the United States’ regulatory framework toward digital assets. Better days ahead for Ripple While XRP continues to make exploits, Ripple has focused on technological advancements and developing business partnerships. The company has been embroiled in a legal tussle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the last few years, with the lawsuit still pending in court. Meanwhile, market observers are of the opinion that the incoming Trump administration, which translates into a new SEC Chair, could drop the case. With XRP already gaining popularity, other traders and investors may also be convinced about the project once its legal troubles end. Most top tokens have endured negative trading days, unlike XRP. Bitcoin has seen its fair share of the bears, Ethereum has only managed to add 1% to its value, while BNB registered a 0.3% drop.

This proposal seeks to hold crypto service providers accountable for reimbursing users who lose funds to fraud or theft. While some welcome this step, others criticize its lack of clarity and potential exclusion of non-custodial wallets . On January 10, the CFPB revealed plans to extend the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) to cover cryptocurrency accounts using “emerging payment mechanisms.” This would align crypto accounts with traditional banking systems, ensuring they follow similar fraud prevention and error resolution standards. The proposal redefines ""funds"" to include assets beyond US dollars, such as cryptocurrencies, broadening the scope of protections. Wallet providers would be required to disclose essential consumer rights, including liability for unauthorized transactions , transaction limits, fees, and error resolution processes. Regular updates and notifications about changes to terms would also become mandatory. If adopted, the rule could offer stronger safeguards for users of stablecoins and other digital assets. Public feedback on the proposal is open until March 31, after which the CFPB will decide on the next steps. Despite its potential to address rising cyber threats—crypto hacks caused losses of around $3 billion in 2024 —the rule has faced criticism. Experts argue the language is vague and may fail to cover non-custodial wallets, raising questions for developers and users. Jai Massari, Chief Legal Officer at Lightspark, highlighted this issue, noting that the rule does not clearly apply to non-custodial wallets. She emphasized the uncertainty this creates for developers and questioned the practicality of some proposed requirements. Legal expert Drew Hinkes raised similar concerns, stating that applying the EFTA framework to crypto transactions might cause complications. He suggested a narrower focus on specific parties and assets to improve clarity. Bill Hughes of Consensys criticized the proposal as regulatory overreach, warning that this trend could persist without intervention from future US leadership. “The push to regulate crypto in the name of consumer protection won’t stop unless someone takes action,” he stated. The proposal has sparked a mix of optimism and skepticism. Its impact will largely depend on whether the CFPB can address these concerns and provide clarity before moving forward.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-12 12:29:51

Ethereum: The Smart Contract Powerhouse Ethereum is often referred to as the king of smart contracts, and for good reason. Since its launch in 2015, Ethereum has been the go-to blockchain for developers building decentralized applications (dApps). Its open-source platform has fueled countless innovations, from DeFi to NFTs, cementing its place among the top cryptos for significant returns. Ethereum’s smart contracts allow for programmable transactions, enabling developers to create applications that operate without intermediaries. This innovation has led to an explosion of projects across various industries, from gaming to healthcare. For instance, decentralized finance platforms built on Ethereum enable users to lend, borrow, and earn interest without needing traditional banks. Despite the emergence of competitors, Ethereum’s massive developer community and proven track record make it a favorite among both institutional and retail investors. Its ongoing upgrades, such as the transition to Ethereum 2.0, aim to address scalability and energy efficiency concerns, ensuring it remains at the forefront of blockchain innovation. Whether you’re a tech enthusiast or a long-term investor, Ethereum’s role in shaping the future of blockchain makes it a must-have in any portfolio. Solana: Speed Meets Scalability Solana has earned its reputation as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchains in the crypto space. Known for its high throughput and low fees, Solana is often called the Ethereum alternative for developers seeking speed without compromising security. This unique positioning has made it one of the top cryptos for significant returns. Solana’s architecture is designed to handle thousands of transactions per second, making it ideal for applications that require high performance. Think of gaming platforms, DeFi protocols, or NFT marketplaces where delays are unacceptable. For example, a gaming app on Solana can process in-game purchases and rewards instantly, enhancing the user experience. The crypto community appreciates Solana for its focus on real-world usability. Its ecosystem continues to grow, with projects across DeFi, gaming, and NFTs choosing Solana as their foundation. For investors, Solana represents a project with both innovation and reliability, making it a solid choice for those seeking long-term growth. The Bottom Line: Why These Cryptos Should Be on Your Radar When it comes to the top cryptos for significant returns, Qubetics, Ethereum, and Solana offer unbeatable potential. Qubetics is leading the charge with its presale success and game-changing dVPN technology. Ethereum remains a cornerstone of blockchain development, driving innovation with its smart contracts.

Jones, a well-known figure in finance, recently sparked conversations within the cryptocurrency community. Her remarks about the altcoin’s potential price movement have generated significant buzz, drawing attention to the digital asset’s future prospects. In a recent podcast session, she discussed the conjecture over her opinion that XRP might attain a value of $100. She said that certain media outlets misconstrued her comments.

Her purpose was to foster discussion about long-term potential within cryptocurrencies such as XRP and not to try to predict their short-term value.

She could buy about 400 units at $0.25 each with the money she put in. Today, she can see that the same amount of money will only buy about 44 XRP, which are worth about $2.20 each. XRPUSD is currently trading at $2.47. Chart: TradingView The Future Of XRP With the current trading price, Jones remains optimistic about the future of XRP. She highlighted that current changes in regulation can create a better environment for cryptocurrencies. Over time, once governments and financial institutions begin to take on digital assets, it will be an upward price trajectory. According to Jones, the more people become knowledgeable and accept cryptocurrencies, assets such as XRP will become critical in the financial world.

She also added that, usually, historical trends in the cryptocurrency space often have dramatic price increases right after periods of regulatory clarity and general market acceptance, giving the investors a chance to look beyond immediate price fluctuations and towards the long-term viability of their investment. As the year 2025 progresses and people’s ideas about digital assets change, Jones’s views will continue to shape talks about the future of altcoins. Even though it’s not clear if XRP will be able to reach such high prices, investors and fans will be closely following its progress.

After enduring a steep decline last week, Solana has managed to stabilize, fueled by renewed market optimism. Solana Price Action | SOLUSDT Between January 5 and January 9, SOL price plunged 15.7%, slipping from $220 to $183 during the peak of the market sell-off. However, as selling pressure began to subside, SOL rebounded 3% over the past two days, climbing as high as $193 on January 12. This recovery suggests that market sentiment is slowly turning favorable, though the pace of Solana’s rebound pace appears limited compared to other major altcoins. Solana rivals , including Cardano (ADA), Ripple (XRP), and SUI, have posted significantly larger gains during the same period. This underperformance highlights a looming bearish catalyst limiting SOL price recovery momentum. Solana Trading Volume plunges by $3.1B as sell-fatigue sets in Solana’s underwhelming performance compared to rival altcoins has been particularly notable over the last few days. A closer look at Solana’s trading data reveals a significant drop in SOL market activity in recent weeks, underscoring dwindling investor participation. Santiment’s Trading Volume chart tracks the daily volume of spot market transactions involving SOL, offering real-time insights into shifts in market liquidity and investor interest. On January 8, Solana’s trading volume reached $5.02 billion, highlighting robust market activity. However, as the broader crypto market sell-off took hold, Solana sellers became increasingly reluctant to offload their holdings, contributing to rapidly declining volumes. Solana Trading Volume | Source: Santiment By January 11, Solana’s trading volume had plummeted to just $1.9 billion, marking a sharp $3.1 billion decline in just three days. This represents a staggering 61% drop in trading volume, even as SOL’s price fell by 15% over the same period. Such a disproportionate drop in trading volume relative to price typically signals weakening market participation and suggests that both buyers and sellers are growing cautious. When trading volume plunges faster than price, it often signals that sell-fatigue has set in, with bearish momentum losing steam. While this could pave the way for a price rebound, the lack of liquidity also limits the potential for a sustained rally. For Solana, this dynamic reflects an ongoing tug-of-war between cautious optimism among holders and broader market headwinds dampening its recovery prospects Solana Price Forecast: $250 Breakout Unlikely within Current Dynamics Solana (SOL) price forecast remains cautious, as technical indicators paint a mixed outlook for the near term. SOL is trading at $186.82, well below the $198.65 mid-line of the Keltner Channels (KC). This highlights diminishing bullish momentum, compounded by the Parabolic SAR hovering above price candles, signaling sustained bearish pressure. Solana price forecast | SOLUSDT The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 47.55, slightly below the neutral 50-mark. This suggests a lack of strong buying or selling pressure, leaving SOL vulnerable to further downside. The $175.70 lower boundary of the KC serves as immediate support, while a break below this level could trigger a decline toward $170. Conversely, a breach above the $198.65 resistance could reignite bullish optimism, targeting the upper KC limit of $220.76. However, with trading volumes at a subdued 590,000 SOL, market participation remains lackluster, limiting the likelihood of a $250 breakout in the short term. Traders should watch for a surge in volume to confirm any directional breakout.

Aave set to surge as altcoin season approaches Aave (AAVE) is trading between $311.41 and $366.37, showing strong momentum. Despite a slight dip of 11.44% over the past week, it has gained 6.68% in the last month and an impressive 196.96% over six months. The price is above both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages, indicating an uptrend. The RSI is at 59.16, suggesting more room for growth. If AAVE can break the nearest resistance at $391, it may reach the next target at $446, which would be about a 20% increase from current levels. With altcoin season approaching, Aave could be poised for significant gains. Polygon gearing up for a breakout: Eyes on the $0.66 resistance Polygon is showing signs of bullish momentum. The price is currently between $0.4646 and $0.5486, hovering around the 100-day moving average of $0.4812. The RSI is at 57.45, indicating strength. Despite a recent dip of over 20% in the past month, the token has gained more than 21% over the last six months. If it breaks the nearest resistance at $0.5809, we could see a rise toward the next level at $0.6650, which would be an increase of about 20% from current levels. With the altcoin season on the horizon, Polygon might be ready for significant growth. Aptos eyes breakout as altcoin season approaches Aptos (APT) is showing signs of a potential breakout as it trades between $8.95 and $10.69. With the nearest resistance at $11.30, a move upwards could see gains of over 20% toward the next level at $13.04. The Relative Strength Index is at 61.15, suggesting room for growth before hitting overbought conditions. The MACD is positive, indicating bullish momentum. Despite a recent one-month decline of 22.43%, Aptos has gained over 42% in the past six months. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is below the current price, supporting a positive outlook. As altcoin season looms, Aptos could be set for significant gains in the upcoming global crypto bull run. JasmyCoin eyes breakout as altcoin season approaches JasmyCoin is showing signs of a potential surge. Despite a recent dip of 6.07% over the past week and 18.06% this month, it has gained 36.70% over six months. Currently trading between $0.03296 and $0.04264, the price is above the 10-day SMA of $0.03193, indicating upward momentum. The RSI stands at 57.53, suggesting bullish sentiment. With the MACD positive and approaching the nearest resistance at $0.04659, a break above this level could propel JasmyCoin towards $0.05627, a possible increase of over 30%. As the altcoin season nears, JasmyCoin could be poised for significant growth. Conclusion Coins like AAVE, POL, APT, and JASMY may have less short-term potential. DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success, aiming for 700% growth by the presale’s end and thousand-fold returns this altcoin season.

In an interview on the Global Money Talk YouTube channel, Lee says Bitcoin has proven its staying power after over a decade of existence. He also notes that it’s now very unlikely for Bitcoin to vanish, given that the incoming Trump administration has repeatedly expressed its support for the largest crypto by market cap. “I think that it’s probably better to just observe a few things. One is Bitcoin has now been around for 15 years, and there has not been a Bitcoin 2.0. So there’s no crypto 2.0, Bitcoin is the surviving chain. And Bitcoin has become a $2 trillion asset which never in financial history has anything reached $2 trillion and then disappeared. It’s a different argument if it was $100 billion. Third is the US government [has] reiterated its commitment to make Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset. That’s not bad for the price of Bitcoin. So if someone is watching this and said, ‘Well, they don’t understand Bitcoin so they decide not to own it.’ It’s a catastrophic way to look at markets.” Lee also believes that the macroeconomic backdrop appears to be acting as a tailwind for risk assets like stocks and crypto, at least for the first half of the year. He adds that his bullish stance is supported by jittery market sentiment and the massive amount of cash still waiting in the wings. “There is probably room for more positive surprises in the first half because we have an incoming president that’s very pro-business, probably the most pro-business president in modern times. And with, so far, the cabinet selections that the market is very happy with. So that should be providing room for investors to become optimistic which they call ‘animal spirits.’ And the second tailwind is that the Fed is dovish. And what that means is that the central bank is easing. So that’s positive for stocks. The third is investors are cautious because almost everyone we talked to thinks valuations are expensive or because we’ve had two good years, [the next year] has to be bad. So we know sentiment is cautious. Usually when people are cautious, then you bet against the caution. And the fourth is that we know mechanically there’s a lot of cash on the sidelines. There’s a lot of firepower – $7 trillion of cash on the sidelines. So I would see this as positive for the first half of [this] year.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Ripple (XRP) and IntelMarkets (INTL) have been recently in the spotlight for their respective veteran status and potential for transformative growth. Not only that, but INTL has spiked by 30% in just 24 hours, a seismic shift in investor sentiment, as Ripple holders continue to be on the losing end of things of the decreasing XRP price. XRP Price: Struggles Amid Market Pressure The reputation of XRP, the digital currency built by Ripple Labs, revolves around its ability to handle cross-border transactions. Once considered a game changer in cross-border payments, the XRP price has had its ups and downs. Many investors remember when Ripple reached its all-time high of $3.84 in December 2017, which was fueled by a bullish market. However, in the next few years, the XRP price was shaky as Ripple faced regulatory challenges. Fast forward to 2025, XRP prices are still turbulent. Still, Ripple trades at around $2.33 per coin, marking a long way off compared to its historical peaks. This week, XRP prices fell by almost 5% and disappointed investors expecting a better recovery. Its performance is also hindered as the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the US SEC does cast a shadow over its performance, hindering its growth potential and fuelling uncertainty around the XRP ETF. Some experts expect XRP prices to rise to as much as $6 by the end of the year. IntelMarkets (INTL): A New Era of Crypto Trading Ripple’s history illustrates why it was challenging for established cryptocurrencies, but IntelMarkets (INTL) is a symbol of innovation and growth. INTL is a newcomer to the market and has quickly staked out its place as being one of the most visionary approaches to trading available. IntelMarkets is integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) to revolutionize the $36 billion global crypto trading market. Over the past 24 hours, IntelMarkets (INTL) has risen a whopping 30% as investors bet on its potential. Yet, the project has already amassed $6.5 million in its ICO — and its token now costs only $0.08 in the 9th presale stage , which opens up a low way to make a profit at the growth of the project. Preparations for listing on Tier 1 exchanges sees INTL bullish analysts predicting a 5x rally following a listing. The AI based trading platform from IntelMarkets is developed to give traders unique tools and capabilities that can never be afforded. The Intell-M self-learning trading robots are capable of analysing vast amounts of data, in real time, to find profitable opportunities. This new way not only makes INTL more efficient, but it introduces democratized access to some advanced strategies in a way that benefits retail investors. Additionally, IntelMarkets’ dual-chain architecture works on both Ethereum and Solana blockchains, thus providing scalability and flexibility. The fact that this project is based on a team of MIT and OpenAI specialists, as well as a technical foundation, gives it proof of credibility and potential mainstream adoption. Final Thoughts The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic place, and fortunes of individual assets depend on their level of adaptation to changing trends. While emerging projects offer the opportunities, established coins Ripple are showing that XRP prices can have struggles too.

Ethereum ( ETH ) was trading at $3,268, down from last month’s high of $4,104. This price action mirrors that of Bitcoin ( BTC ), which has retreated from an all-time high of $108,000 to below $95,000. Ether has pulled back as data shows that demand for its ETFs on Wall Street has fallen in the past few days. According to SoSoValue , all Ethereum funds lost $68 million in assets on Friday after losing $159.3 million on Thursday. They lost $86 million in assets on Wednesday. These funds now have over $11.61 billion in assets, representing 2.96% of Ethereum’s market cap. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs have $107 billion in assets, or 5.2% of its market cap. Meanwhile, according to CoinGlass, Ethereum balances on centralized exchanges have risen this year. There are now 15.8 million ETH coins on exchanges, up from 15.30 million on Dec. 30. Higher exchange balances is a sign that investors are moving their tokens from their wallets to CEX platforms. Transferring cryptocurrencies to exchanges is usually the first step for selling them. Ethereum balances on CEX exchanges | Source: CoinGlass More data shows that Ethereum’s futures open interest has dropped from its December high of $31.1 billion, a sign of falling demand. In the last five days, its daily open interest has remained at $28.4 billion, down from the December high of $31.1 billion. You might also like: Donald Trump: First Sitting U.S. President to HODL meme coins On the positive side, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies often rebound when the open interest falls. For example, ETH price started its recent rally in November when the interest dropped to $14 billion. Meanwhile, Ethereum stakers are generating a smaller yield. According to StakingRewards , ETH has a staking reward rate of 3.10%, much lower than Solana’s ( SOL ) 7% and Tron’s ( TRX ) 4.52%. Ethereum’s staking rewards often drops when more tokens are delegated to staking pools and when fees fall. As shown below, Ethereum’s fees have been on a downward trajectory in the last few weeks. Ethereum fees | Source: TokenTerminal Ethereum price chart analysis ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the ETH price peaked at $4,104 in December, forming a double-top pattern with a neckline at $3,520. It has dropped below the 50-day moving average at $3,415, and found substantial support at the 100-day moving average. Ethereum also found support at the ascending trendline that connects the lowest levels since Nov. 15. There are signs that the coin has formed a head-and-shoulders pattern, a popular bearish sign. Therefore, a drop below the 100-day moving average and the ascending trendline will point to a bearish breakdown, potentially to $2,820, the highest level since August last year.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bitcoin nears $100K, signaling recovery, while Catzilla gains buzz with explosive growth potential in the crypto market. Bitcoin is hovering near a monumental milestone, signaling a strong market recovery. Yet, another player is piquing interest among investors. Catzilla, a lesser-known asset, is making waves with its remarkable growth potential. Market enthusiasts are buzzing about its prospects for exponential gains this year, capturing the imagination of those looking for the next big opportunity in the crypto space. Catzilla: The meme coin movement redefined Greed? Overthrown! Crypto Manipulators? Defeated! Scammers? Unmasked! Catzilla isn’t just another meme coin — it’s a heroic force in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, standing against corruption and championing financial inclusivity. Fueled by innovation and a passionate community, Catzilla unites crypto enthusiasts, meme lovers, and ambitious investors under a shared vision of prosperity. Built for long-term growth, not empty promises Unlike fleeting crypto projects that fade as quickly as they appear, Catzilla is designed for sustained success. Its structured presale strategy spans 14 stages, starting at just $0.0002 and culminating at $0.0016, giving early adopters an 88% discount. With a transparent roadmap and a clear commitment to growth, Catzilla is setting a new standard in the meme coin space. Triple the value with unique utility The CATZILLA token is more than just hype — it’s packed with real utility: Governance: Have a say in shaping Catzilla’s direction and decisions. Incentives: Earn rewards for participation and support. Staking: Stake CATZILLA tokens to unlock the potential for passive income. This trifecta of utility ensures that CATZILLA isn’t just fun — it’s functional and rewarding for its community. Don’t miss the movement The future of crypto isn’t just about milestones like Bitcoin’s $100K—it’s about new opportunities. With Catzilla, you can join a bold, transparent, and inclusive movement reshaping the market. Bitcoin: A changing digital currency Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency, introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto. It uses blockchain technology for decentralized peer-to-peer transactions, eliminating the need for banks. Bitcoin is a digital currency, not physical, and its transactions are recorded on a distributed ledger. Miners validate these transactions by solving puzzles, earning bitcoins as rewards. The total supply is capped at 21 million bitcoins, and rewards decrease by half approximately every four years in an event called “halving.” This system helps protect against fraud. Bitcoin’s potential lies in its ability to allow secure, direct transactions worldwide. Its attractiveness in the current market depends on factors such as supply limits, technological adoption, and market conditions.

Elon Buys Solana (ELONBSOL), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Buys Solana launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 85b1Mza2zF6SDGXZURjeu53wdapN6W1UjFC4PAqhKE8k – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 13:02:00

According to the plan, the first round of repayments will happen for creditors with claims below $50,000. This makes it a total of approximately $1.2 billion, with January 3 as the record date. FTX has asked creditors to complete pre-distribution requirements for initial distribution by January 20. Creditors are informed to complete W-8Ben forms. Once KYC verified, creditors need to submit a tax withholding form within 30 days. It is important to note that if a creditor fails to submit the tax form before the 60-day deadline, they will not receive repayments.

Posing as the recruiters of genuine companies, fraudsters convinced victims into signing up to be a product reviewer. Victims were then asked to open cryptocurrency accounts and deposit money and maintain a balance matching the full cost of the product they were supposedly reviewing. These scammers had convinced their victims that all deposits were merely for “legitimization” of the transactions and would be returned with a commission for the job. But they never got their money back, nor did they get paid; on the contrary, their cryptocurrency had been stolen, which meant a considerable financial loss. Coordinated Recovery Efforts with US Secret Service New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit to recover more than $2.2 million in cryptocurrency that was stolen. Working with the US Secret Service, the funds were frozen, and now the process of justice can truly begin for these victims. James’ warning comes to New Yorkers: Beware of unsolicited work-from-home jobs via text message or other websites. Those texts and messages, according to him, are more than likely scams. “It is cruel and unacceptable that individuals are lying to New Yorkers looking to find remote opportunities and earn a paycheck to feed their families,” James said in a statement . Work-From-Home Scam Warning Previously Given by FBI The lawsuit comes after a warning from the FBI in June 2024, stating that work-from-home scams were on the rise, targeting vulnerable individuals. Scammers use different methods to reach out to their victims, such as unsolicited calls and messages, offering fake jobs. These may include jobs related to rating products, optimizing services, or reviewing restaurants. In many cases, victims were asked to send cryptocurrencies to their alleged employers in order to “unlock” more tasks or benefits. These payments, however, went directly to the scammers, leaving victims with no recourse. The FBI urged people to be wary of unsolicited job offers that require paying upfront or transacting in cryptocurrency. These are usually signs of fraud. Beware of Job Scams With scams like these on the rise, the authorities have to reiterate verifying job offers and avoiding paying in advance. Attorney General James’s lawsuit in this direction tries to hold these scammers liable and recover the funds stolen. It has been a case of caveat emptor on the part of the individuals interacting with such job opportunities online. Working hand in glove with federal agencies, such as the US Secret Service, the New York system of justice attempts to protect citizens and recover stolen assets in this ever-changing world of digital fraud.",Blockchain|Regulation|Scam|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-01-12 13:13:57

These digital assets have the potential to increase in value dramatically, possibly reaching gains of up to 16,000%. Discover what makes these altcoins stand out and why they might be the next big opportunity. Knockout champion: XYZ redefines meme coins in 2025 The crowd is on fire — XYZ is stepping into the crypto ring and delivering knockout blows to scam tokens, dead-end projects, and tired farming schemes. As the first-ever all-sports meme coin, XYZ has powered through the bear market with unstoppable momentum. With a blazing 75X growth target, XYZ is ready to leave 2024’s meme coin stars like BOME and WIF eating its dust. Rule the game, earn big XYZ is transforming the playing field with XYZVerse, an ecosystem crowned as the Best NEW Meme Project. By combining the thrill of sports with the viral power of memes, XYZVerse is drawing millions of fans eager to join the action. Its roadmap is stacked with entertainment dApps and community-driven tools, ensuring that early supporters reap massive rewards. Picture this: Polymarket’s $1 billion trading frenzy during the US elections — now imagine that amplified in XYZ’s GameFi ecosystem. This meme-sports hybrid is perfectly positioned to ride the waves of crypto mass adoption and sports betting fever, giving stakeholders a winning edge. Didn’t catch the last supercycle? Here’s the Shot The rise of XYZ is no fluke. With a presale structured for 7,400% gains by TGE, XYZ is poised to outshine meme coin legends like BOME’s 5,000% and WIF’s 1,000% rallies. Undervalued and on the rise, XYZ offers a rare opportunity for early investors to ride the rocket before it takes off. This isn’t just another meme coin — it’s the G.O.A.T. in the making.

A thriving ecosystem and consistent price growth that rewards loyal supporters. XRP’s remarkable growth amid price fluctuations Over the past six months, XRP has soared by 375.86%. Despite a recent dip of 2.94% in the last week, the coin has maintained a 2.10% increase over the past month. This impressive growth highlights XRP’s resilience and its potential in the cryptocurrency market. Currently trading between $2.09 and $2.61, XRP faces its nearest resistance at $2.81. Breaking this level could push the price towards the second resistance at $3.32, an approximate 27% rise from the current range. On the downside, the nearest support is at $1.79, with a second support level at $1.28, indicating key points where the price might stabilize if it falls. Technical indicators suggest that XRP might be poised for a rebound. The Relative Strength Index is at 33.11, close to the oversold threshold of 30. The Stochastic oscillator is at 10.12, well into the oversold territory below 20. Additionally, the MACD level is negative at -0.0109, hinting at diminishing bearish momentum. These factors combined could signal a potential upward movement in XRP’s price soon. Dogecoin navigates price swings Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to experience market volatility. Over the past week, its price has dipped slightly by 0.43%, and it has faced a notable 21.78% decline in the last month. However, the coin has surged by an impressive 200.19% over the past six months, showcasing its ability to rebound over time. Currently trading between $0.33 and $0.42, DOGE’s nearest resistance is at $0.46, with support at $0.27. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.33, while the 100-day average stands at $0.37, reflecting a recent downward trend. Technical indicators, including a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 27.94 and a Stochastic oscillator reading of 12.82, suggest the asset is oversold. Meanwhile, the MACD at -0.0055 indicates bearish momentum but hints at a possible trend reversal. If DOGE surpasses the $0.46 resistance, it could aim for a second resistance at $0.55, representing a potential 66% gain from the lower end of its current range. However, a drop below $0.27 may push DOGE toward a second support at $0.1766, which would mean a 46% decline. These levels highlight the importance of monitoring the market closely as DOGE navigates these critical price points. Conclusion XRP and DOGE show promise, but XYZVerse aims higher, uniting sports fans in a meme coin targeting 20,000% growth by Q2 2025.

Ripple TVL kicked off 2025 positively, reaching a total value of $60.48 million. Also, the XRP price has seen positive momentum emerge from the correction at the end of 2024. Meanwhile, a newbie, DTX Exchange (DTX), has beaten Ripple in both developments and price momentum. DTX Exchange is emerging as the next heavyweight of the sector and is ready for a significant increase in 2025. DTX’s hybrid protocol and strategic actions make it one of the altcoins to keep track of. XRP Price May Hit $5 Amid Significant Ripple TVL Drive The Ripple TVL has seen a notable rise from 10 September last year to its current value of over $60 million, according to DeFiLlama. Rapid Ripple TVL growth indicates a great opportunity for investors since total value-locked (TVL) shifts provide insight into project advancements. The XRP price follows the same trend, with the price being $2.29 at the moment of writing; it has increased 11% since the 1st of January. Courtesy: TradingView The XRP price peaked in December after a parabolic rise in the first stage of the bull run; since then, it has been trading in a descending triangle pattern, which broke out on the first day of the new year. The XRP price saw a good follow-through of the rise before the market was hit with weak economic reports. Currently, the XRP price is down 8.20% from the previous swing high, stabilizing above the $2 key support support. If XRP price reverses the correction trend, it could gain around 32% according to the calculated target, signaling the continuation of its earlier bull run. Along with the rise in Ripple TVL, a shift in SEC leadership, especially with Gary Gensler’s departure, might create a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, which could benefit XRP price. DTX Exchange (DTX): The Next Crypto Star With the exceptional rise in Ripple TVL, the XRP price started in 2025 with a positive flow, while DTX Exchange (DTX) is a new participant in the crypto scene, which is scaling rapidly. With its characteristic infrastructure and an imaginative application of digital currencies in the trading exchange economy, the new cryptocurrency has caused quite a stir. DTX Exchange has come up with the world-first ever multi-asset trading exchange, which allows users to trade over 120,000+ financial instruments under a single roof, including stocks, crypto, forex, bonds, and commodities. Additionally, DTX Exchange offers 1,000x leverage to optimize returns with larger market positions. The platform reduces slippage or any hiccups through distributed liquidity pools, and DTX Exchange assists high-volume traders in operating efficiently with global reach. With the platform’s no-KYC policy, traders don’t need to go through the hectic KYC procedure. DTX’s proprietary non-custodial wallet, Phoenix Wallet, has had over 50,000+ downloads in just one month of launch. The wallet is popular for its high security and technology for seamless transactions in diverse assets. Since its launch, the presale has seen a remarkable 600% rise in value; each token now costs $0.14 in Stage 7. Investor excitement has driven this rise, and over 170 million tokens have been sold, raising $11.54 million. Industry experts believe that DTX could grow by 22,100 %, making it appealing to those investors interested in assets with considerable growth potential.

Addressing his 3.9 million followers on X, Michael Saylor claimed that he would be making new BTC purchases by sharing a post saying, “I’m thinking about the next green dot on the chart,” referring to a website that tracks Bitcoin purchase levels of his company MicroStrategy. The new acquisition will likely be announced tomorrow. No information was shared about the size of the acquisition. Related News: What's in Donald Trump's Last Cryptocurrency Wallet Before He Takes Over? “Memecoin Paradise” According to current data, MicroStrategy currently holds 447,470 Bitcoins worth $42.38 billion. The average purchase price of these was calculated as 62,472. The company seems to have accelerated its purchases recently, especially with the BTC price settling around $100,000. In the last two months, they have made a total of 8 large BTC purchases, excluding the possible next purchase. Remarkably, they are currently losing $149 million from one of their biggest purchases of recent times, a $5.4 billion BTC transaction on November 25, which was made at $97,862. *This is not investment advice.

38841602,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=642058,1736689244,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38841602.jpeg,Donald Trump and Xi Jinping being friends could actually turn out bad for the global economy,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/donald-trump-and-xi-jinping-friends/,"Donald Trump calling Xi Jinping “my friend” again might seem like old news, but their growing bromance could actually slam the global economy harder than a wrecking ball. Trump, stepping back into the Oval on January 20, has all intentions of smacking China with tariffs and potentially starting a trade war. Now his chatter about mutual respect and “two-way streets” has analysts bracing for chaos. The president tends to do that from time to time. And China isn’t exactly sitting pretty right now. The country is dealing with sluggish growth, deflation, a real estate meltdown, and debt that’s piling up faster than TikTok trends. Trump’s past approach to Beijing wasn’t exactly gentle, and with his new team full of “China hawks,” it’s clear he isn’t coming back to play nice. Xi might smile through gritted teeth at the “friend” label, but this uneasy friendship has disaster written all over it. And don’t even get us started on how Russia’s president Vladimir Putin, who is Xi’s actual best friend, fits into all this. China’s economy is hanging by a thread Let’s talk numbers because they don’t lie. China’s domestic demand is a disaster. Consumers aren’t spending, growth is crawling, and confidence is nowhere to be found. On top of that, the real estate sector—once a crown jewel—is in freefall. Local governments are drowning in debt, and there’s no clear rescue plan in sight. To make things worse, deflation is creeping in. Prices are dropping, which might sound great, but it’s really just another red flag signaling a stalled economy. And this is where Trump comes in like a bull in a china shop. According to Bloomberg Economics, if tariffs triple by the end of 2026—as many expect under Trump—China could lose 83% of its sales to the U.S. On January 7, the U.S. president told a conservative talk show host that he and Xi had already started talking through their representatives. Trump called Xi “strong and powerful” but made it clear this “friendship” isn’t a one-way street. He’s still accusing China of ripping off the U.S. economically and has no plans to let that slide. China’s Foreign Ministry gave a diplomatic response, saying it values “stable and healthy” trade relations based on mutual respect. But let’s be real: if these guys become friends, they’d have to turn into enemies shortly after. Neither of them is known for going down without a fight, and Xi would rather die than let Trump embarrass him by undermining his ‘hard-earned power.’ That Inauguration invitation was already disrespectful enough. And Trump has been intentionally trying to start a beef with Putin, whose first action after November 5, was to extend an olive branch to the man who once called him “buddy.” But hey, dealing with Trump has never been easy. Not for Americans, not for his cabinet, not for the Federal Reserve, and certainly not for financial markets. He thrives on keeping people on their toes. It’s incredible to witness. A new trade war will break global supply chains If Trump goes ahead with his tariff hikes, it’s not just China that gets hit. The entire world economy could feel the blow. Global supply chains, already stretched thin after years of disruptions, could snap under the weight of new tariffs. Prices for goods everywhere would skyrocket, and shortages could creep into critical sectors like tech and manufacturing. Remember the chip shortage? Picture that, but worse. Meanwhile, stock markets could go haywire. Investors hate uncertainty, and a full-scale trade war between the world’s two biggest economies is the kind of uncertainty that sends markets into freefall. Foreign investment in China, already shaky, might collapse altogether. Wall Street and crypto markets are a little too sensitive to economic uncertainty. Elon’s Tesla factory in Shanghai complicates things Enter Elon Musk, because of course, the king of the nerds is always at the scene of the crime. His Tesla factory in Shanghai is its largest globally, cranking out more than half of the company’s cars. This factory operates under conditions most foreign companies can only dream of. Thanks to special concessions from the Chinese government, Elon’s Shanghai plant is wholly owned, a rare arrangement in China. And according to Trump, this guy is now America’s “ First Buddy .” They’re obsessed with each other. And why wouldn’t they be? Elon gave Trump’s campaign hundreds of millions of dollars. Now analysts think he might use his influence to soften Trump’s stance on China, especially when it comes to tariffs on electric vehicles. Tesla, after all, depends heavily on its Shanghai factory to keep up with global demand. Plus, Elon and Xi get along really well… for obvious reasons. Xi isn’t taking Trump’s bait outright, but he isn’t ignoring him either. China has kept communication channels open and seems cautious about making any sudden decisions. However, Xi loves Putin. He famously said their friendship “had no limits.” So if Trump starts a fight with Putin, like he seems a bit determined to, it’s not up for debate who Xi would side with. Both countries need America to sustain their economies, yes, but their leaders would never do it at the expense of their self-respect. And that’s what it will come down to in the end.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Sui’s 600% rally in 2024 was impressive, but experts believe Rollblock could outperform it in 2025 after a 300% presale surge. Sui shattered records in 2024 with an impressive 600% rally. The token’s growth was driven by strong fundamentals, boasting more users and a higher TVL than most other Layer 1s. However, as we step into 2025, experts suggest that Rollblock could surpass even this highly successful project. Having already rallied by over 300% during its presale experts believe it could outperform major altcoins in 2025. You might also like: Leading cryptos to buy ahead of Trump inauguration rally: XRP, Rollblock, and Cardano Investors eye Rollblock as it hits another major milestone The final month of 2024 was a big win for Rollblock . The GambleFi protocol recorded over $1.75 million in wagers and saw a 600% spike in deposits and sign-ups, bringing its total player base even higher. This impressive growth was driven by the launch of sports betting for major global events like soccer, The NFL and boxing. That’s not the only reason Rollblock is gaining so much traction. The protocol is transforming online betting before our eyes, using blockchain technology to tap into a market projected to hit $153 billion annually. Reports show that more than 9% of iGaming sites are known for game tampering and deposit theft, making them risky places for players to gamble their money. Rollblock is changing that with blockchain. On its platform, every outcome from its 7,000 AI-powered games is registered and encrypted on-chain, making the results tamper-proof — even the casino owners can’t alter them. At the core of this unique platform is RBLK, Rollblock’s native utility token. Currently priced at $0.0445 in its ninth presale stage, RBLK has already delivered over 330% returns for early investors. To achieve this Rollblock’s token features a revenue-sharing model. The protocol allocates up to 30% of its revenue to purchasing RBLK from the open market. 60% of those tokens are burned to reduce supply, while the remaining 40% is distributed as rewards to stakers. Thanks to this system, analysts believe RBLK could deliver a 100x return and hit $1 by the end of 2025. Can Sui enter the top ten cryptocurrencies? Sui has emerged as one of the fastest-growing Layer 1 blockchains, with its TVL recently hitting a new all-time high of $2.04 billion, according to DefiLlama. This surge reflects rising demand for Sui’s DeFi protocols and application ecosystem, positioning the network as a significant player in the competitive blockchain space. The token is currently trading around $4.60, retesting its $4 breakout level. If this level holds, Sui could rally further, with the next target at $6. However, failure to maintain support at $4.60 may lead to a retest of lower boundaries around $3.90. Sui is trading within an ascending channel, showing consistently higher highs and higher lows — a clear sign of sustained bullish momentum. Indicators like the MACD and RSI also reflect bullish conditions. The RSI is at 66.69, just below the overbought zone, suggesting room for further upside. Sui’s ecosystem continues to expand, backed by partnerships with institutions like VanEck, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton. The network’s recent 82 million token unlock has also enhanced liquidity without disrupting the market, further solidifying investor confidence. Can Rollblock repeat Sui’s massive 600% rally? Sui became one of the top-performing assets of 2024, driven by the success of its underlying blockchain. Rollblock is following a similar approach – positioning itself as the leading GambleFi project with the potential for explosive token growth. Currently priced at $0.045, RBLK has already delivered a 330% return for early investors. Analysts predict that once this token hits the open market, it could become the first 100x gem of 2025, reaching a price of $1.

Despite this, some analysts have been weighing the possibility of a new Solana ATH. Others have turned their attention to Lunex Network , a new crypto with massive DeFi potential. After SOL’s stand-off with ETH in 2024, the question now is: Could $LNEX be the next crypto alpha? With its unique offerings and growing popularity, Lunex Network has carved its name as a challenge to the top ranks in the crypto space. Lunex Network: The New Crypto Unlocking DeFi Potential Lunex Network represents a modern vision of crypto trading, blending technological sophistication with a user-centric approach. It is different both from traditional centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges in that it concerns efficiency and returns power to the user. The major feature of Lunex Network is its liquidity aggregation protocol sourcing from numerous blockchain sources. The resulting effect makes prices more extensive while allowing for minimal slippage-smoothening of the trading experience. The non-custody model allows for trading directly from private wallets, avoiding the risks of centralized platforms. Lunex Network ensures transparent and automated processes through smart contracts, thus giving verifiable transactions with minimal error possibilities through humans. The decentralized nature also adds an extra layer of security such that in cases of breaches or bankruptcy, user assets would still be safe. First, support for more than 50,000 multi-chain pairs and over 40 blockchains is available, so users can trade in various assets. Secondly, Lunex Network has a portfolio tracker that gives real-time insights into the portfolios, enabling the user to make an educated choice. Multiple staking options and deflationary tokenomics create incentives for long-term participation on Lunex, while security, transparency, and users are at the core of the Lunex Network. Solana ATH In Sight After A Successful 2024 Solana (SOL) has fallen below $195, reflecting a slight decline. Despite this minor dip, SOL has demonstrated resilience, maintaining its position as a leading blockchain platform. Recent developments have bolstered SOL’s market position. The integration of advanced scalability solutions has enhanced transaction speeds and reduced costs, attracting increased developer interest. Additionally, dApps like pump.fun and Raydium have catapulted SOL’s ecosystem beyond the sun. As such, analysts project a positive outlook for SOL in 2025. Price predictions vary, with estimates ranging from $270 to $750, averaging around $470. This suggests a potential for a new all-time high if the lowest estimate is even above the current ATH. Technical indicators reflect a neutral market sentiment. The RSI stands at 45, indicating balanced buying and selling pressures. The MACD is flattening, suggesting indecision among traders. Despite these signals, the overall market sentiment remains optimistic, supported by SOL’s ongoing developments and strategic initiatives. Conclusion As the crypto market looks to 2025, Lunex Network stands out with its innovative DeFi solutions and marketplace acceptance. Currently priced at just $0.0054 per token, Lunex Network presents a unique investment opportunity. Secure your $LNEX tokens now before the price increases and be part of the next crypto revolution!

Analyst Weighs In On Interesting BTC Setup",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-to-140000-or-67000-analyst-weighs-in-on-interesting-btc-setup/,"After an unexpected bearish plot twist in the past week, the Bitcoin price action has been pretty quiet over the weekend, with BTC barely holding above the $94,000 level. The premier cryptocurrency briefly slipped beneath this price mark on Saturday, January 11, before traveling to as high as $94,870. Interestingly, a top analyst on the social media platform X has put forward an interesting analysis of the Bitcoin price, suggesting that the market leader might be at a pivotal juncture. Could a bullish breakout be on the cards for the price of BTC or is a deep correction the more likely scenario? Bitcoin’s Performance In The Next Few Weeks In a recent post on X, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez weighed in on the trajectory of the Bitcoin price over the next few weeks. According to the market pundit, the flagship cryptocurrency is currently set up such that it could see a move higher to $140,000 or a pullback to around $67,000. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bull Market Still On? STH Cost Basis Suggests So These projections are based on the formation of two patterns, namely the head-and-shoulders and the bull pennant, on the BTC 12-hour price chart. The pennant pattern is marked by a price upswing (the flagpole) followed by a consolidation range with converging trend lines (the pennant), while the head-and-shoulders formation (as the name suggests) is characterized by three distinct price highs, including a higher “head” between two lower “shoulders.” The pennant chart formation often serves as a bullish continuation pattern, suggesting the persistence of an upward price trend. The head-and-shoulders pattern, on the other hand, typically indicates a potential bearish reversal, signaling a shift from an uptrend to a downtrend. As seen in the chart above, the Bitcoin price is yet to break beneath the neckline of the head-and-shoulders pattern, which often serves as confirmation for the trend reversal. If the premier cryptocurrency breaks the neckline situated at around $93,000, its price could plunge to as low as $67,000. However, Martinez pointed out that the next target could be higher if the Bitcoin price holds above the neckline and breaks out of the bull pennant pattern. If this occurs, a bullish surge to around $140,000 could be on the cards for the price of the market leader. This would represent an almost 50% rally from the current price point. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $94,600, reflecting no significant change in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the premier cryptocurrency is down by nearly 4% in the last seven days. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Bounce Back?

However, as it’s looking to turn out, all BTC really did was go into healthy consolidation after a big move in December. Technical analysis experts have now presented several BTC charts that all say the worst is over for Bitcoin and, by extension, the overall crypto market. With another potential crypto bull run just around the corner, the time is right for you to invest in the dip. One of the best ways to multiply your investment in crypto is by purchasing high-potential altcoins, such as the ones we’ve handpicked for you after careful research. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Overall Best Altcoin Presale for First-Time Investors Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is a descendant of the insanely popular Pepe meme, but it’s not all fun and games! The purpose of the project is to make profitable crypto investing accessible for everyone by sharing unique trading insights that are usually reserved for Wall Street pros. $WEPE’s community-driven approach ensures that crypto whales can no longer control the market. The token is currently in presale and has collected over $45M so far and it’s well on its way towards $50M. Currently, each $WEPE token is priced at $0.00036646, but it will soon increase as the token is set to enter the next phase of its presale. Speaking of returns, experts are predicting a 10x return under a conservative scenario. Some are even predicting a 500% increase from the current listing price. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana Layer-2 Token Promises to Solve Solana’s Limitations Solaxy ($SOLX) is the native currency of the new Layer-2 protocol that Solaxy is building for Solana. For those who don’t know, Solana is a popular blockchain, at par with Bitcoin and Ethereum. This new network will solve all the problems of the previous Layer-1 chains, namely congestion, scalability, and unsuccessful and slow transactions. It’s also worth noting that $SOLX can be used on both ecosystems, which will result in greater liquidity and easier access to DeFi platforms for crypto investors and traders. Speaking of $SOLX’s presale, $9.8M has already been raised. Each token is presently available at $0.001598, and several experts suggest that it has the potential to be the next 100x token. To know more about $SOLX’s uniqueness, check out its whitepaper and X feed. 3.

For instance, the bonus rate in round 1 was 10%. The rate for the last round will be based on the token’s performance. Each token is currently priced at $0.0284, but prices increase in the next 5 days. It’s also worth noting that $YTP’s estimated listing price, which is at all times mentioned on its official website , has been rapidly increasing. Just a week ago, it was $2.8322, but it’s now $8.8223, so those who purchase $YTP right now can potentially reap mind-boggling returns. 5. Rexas Finance (RXS) – Promises to Transform Real-World Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance (RXS) is an interesting project that aims to transform distributed finance (DeFi) and simplify real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. For those who don’t know, RWA is the process of converting real-world tangible things into tokens that can then be traded on blockchains.

PEPETO’s strategic approach to building its ecosystem—with real utility backing its memecoin status—positions it uniquely in the market. Here’s why this makes PEPETO a compelling choice for investors looking to diversify: Community and Engagement: Like the famed Dogecoin before it, PEPETO is forging a path where community involvement translates into value creation. The engaging nature of the token, coupled with actual use cases, fosters a strong community bond. Innovative Features: The introduction of features like a zero-fee exchange not only disrupts traditional crypto exchange models but also aligns with a broader trend towards lowering the entry barrier for new and casual investors.

The price seems to be moving down towards a key support range between $2,400 and $2,840. Even though this move may unfold in multiple stages, there is a chance the correction could end earlier than expected. At the time of writing, Ethereum is down by more than one percent and is trading below the $3300 level. Key Resistance and Support Levels The trend is bearish as long as Ethereum remains below the resistance zone between $3,370 and $3,613. A break below $3,170, the low from Thursday, would likely signal further downward movement. If Ethereum manages to push higher within the resistance area, it may indicate that a larger pullback is forming. Alternative Scenario: Potential Upside Breakout There is an alternative scenario to consider, where the current price action could form a triangular pattern, possibly leading to a breakout to the upside. Although this is less likely, it’s worth keeping an eye on as it could have positive implications for Ethereum. Looking Ahead: Possible Path to New Highs Despite the short-term downtrend, the overall uptrend remains intact. If Ethereum finds support soon and begins to stabilize, it could pave the way for a stronger rally toward new all-time highs. Watch for signs of a price bottom, as this could signal the next upward move.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-12 15:05:11

Kaspa: The high-speed cryptocurrency changing the game Kaspa is a new cryptocurrency that’s making waves with its unique technology. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that use blockchains, Kaspa uses something called a blockDAG. This stands for “block-directed acyclic graph.” In simple terms, this means Kaspa can handle many blocks at the same time without discarding any. This is possible because of its GHOSTDAG protocol, which allows blocks created in parallel to coexist and be ordered in consensus. Thanks to this technology, Kaspa achieves very high speeds — currently processing one block per second, aiming for 10 per second, and dreaming of 100 per second. Kaspa’s speed and efficiency make it stand out in the current market cycle. With features like quick confirmations and scalability, it addresses some of the biggest challenges faced by other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which can be slow and have high fees. Kaspa also includes innovative tools like Reachability for querying the network and has plans for further improvements. In a market that values speed and efficiency, Kaspa looks like an attractive option for those interested in new and advanced cryptocurrencies. Avalanche’s AVAX: The fast and eco-friendly blockchain making waves Avalanche is a blockchain platform that’s turning heads in the crypto world. It’s known for being green, quick, and cost-effective. Able to handle up to 4,500 transactions per second, it leaves many competitors behind. A standout feature is its customizable Subnets, allowing users to build their own blockchains within the platform. Avalanche finalizes transactions in less than two seconds using a unique mix of consensus methods. It operates with three main chains—X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—that work together for different tasks. At the heart of it all is AVAX, the native token used for fees, staking, and more. AVAX has strong potential due to its impressive technology and practical uses. Its speed and low costs are big advantages in a market where many blockchains struggle with high fees and slow transactions. Compared to other coins, AVAX offers a blend of efficiency and customization that’s hard to match. This makes it stand out in the current market cycle. The ability to create custom tokens and blockchains opens doors for innovation and growth. While the crypto market is always changing, Avalanche’s features position it as an attractive option to watch. Polkadot: The blockchain bridge connecting the crypto world Imagine a world where different blockchains can talk to each other seamlessly. That’s what Polkadot aims to achieve. It’s a network that allows blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin to share information and value without the need for middlemen. This is possible through “parachains,” which make transactions faster and help the network handle more activity than older systems. Polkadot’s coin, known as DOT, gives holders a voice in how the network grows. Users can also use DOT to help verify transactions and keep the network secure, earning rewards in the process. Created by one of Ethereum’s founders, Polkadot looks to fix some issues found in earlier blockchains. In today’s market, where scalability and interoperability are big topics, Polkadot stands out. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, DOT offers unique features that could make it an attractive option for those interested in the future of blockchain technology. NEAR Protocol: Bridging the gap to a scalable decentralized future NEAR Protocol aims to make decentralized applications (dApps) more accessible and efficient. Founded by Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin, it has raised over $20 million from major venture firms. NEAR uses a technique called sharding to improve scalability, allowing the network to handle more transactions faster. Its Nightshade sharding solution divides the network into smaller pieces, making it more efficient. The Rainbow Bridge lets users transfer tokens from Ethereum to NEAR, while Aurora, a Layer 2 solution, leverages Ethereum’s technologies for better performance and lower fees. In the current market, NEAR stands out with its focus on scalability and developer support. As dApps grow in popularity, networks that can handle increased demand are crucial. NEAR’s technologies, like Nightshade and Aurora, position it well against competitors. While Ethereum continues to face scalability issues, NEAR offers a faster, more cost-effective alternative. This could make it an attractive option for developers and investors looking for the next big thing in the crypto space. Conclusion While KAS, AVAX, DOT, and NEAR show promise, XYZVerse stands out by uniting meme culture and sports, aiming for massive growth and becoming a cultural icon.

Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Yeti Ouro (YETIO) are gaining attention as analysts predict upward trends for Q1. Each of these tokens demonstrates unique factors driving their performance, from technical patterns to innovative developments. Ethereum (ETH): Battling Resistance At $4,000 The price of ETH is currently $3,304 , with a 0.24% increase in the last 24 hours. However, there is high sell pressure that is making it difficult for ETH price to rise above $4,000. According to CryptoQuant, the taker buy-sell ratio is at 0.84, which shows that there are more sell orders placed, and as per Santiment, the weighted sentiment is negative at -0.67, which is suggestive of caution in the market. The key technical levels to watch are the support level at $3,332 and the resistance level at $4,000. Further weakness could take the ETH price to $2,509, while further buy support could take the ETH price above $4,000, possibly reaching $4,783, its four-year high. Source X We have seen that the post-halving period has been positive in the past, and upgrades like the Shanghai agreement in 2024 increase the confidence of institutions. The recent launch of BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF, which has attracted more than $1.5 billion in assets, also supports ETH’s long-term prospects. Cardano (ADA) Aiming For New Heights In Q1 2025 Cardano’s ADA has seen an increase of more than 30% in the first quarter of 2025, with ADA price at $0.953 , and analysts expect it to reach $1.50 by March. An ascending pennant chart pattern analyzed by on-chain trader Ali Martinez indicates that ADA might bust through resistance levels of $1.25 and $1.33, with long-term forecasts pointing towards $7 in 2025. Cardano’s TVL spiked 33% in 2024 and was standing at $595 million in comparison with the previous year. Besides, 10,000+ new wallets were on-boarded post-December. Transaction volume per day is above $10 million, which shows a steady uptake. The improvements made in the scalability of the blockchain and the Chang Hard Fork have boosted investors' confidence. Some levels to watch for are the resistance level at $1.34 and support at $0.95. If the price crosses above the resistance level, it might drive further gains; on the flip side, if the price falls below the support level, it might lead to some retracement. Source X Yeti Ouro (YETIO) Emerging As A Play-to-Earn Contender Yeti Ouro is yet another cryptocurrency project that is currently in the presale stage and seems to be growing in popularity. Currently trading at $0.017, the token has gathered more than $1.579 million in its presale and is 22.3% through its funding goal for the second stage. The first phase sold out and raised $1.2 million in funding from the second marketplace. A major factor that has attracted investors to YETIO is the idea of “YetiGo,” a P2E game based on racing simulation using the Unreal Engine 5.

The data also finds that software firm MicroStrategy, founded by BTC maxi Michael Saylor, bought $24 billion worth of the crypto king last year while financial services giant Fidelity accumulated $20 billion worth of BTC. Other notable digital assets in BlackRock’s portfolio include $3.6 billion worth of top altcoin Ethereum ( ETH ) and $68.5 million worth of the stablecoin USDC . Source: Arkham/X However, Arkham goes on to note that BlackRock – which has over $10 trillion in assets under its management – isn’t accumulating the top crypto asset by market cap anymore. Rather, it has reversed course and is unloading BTC in the short term. Source: Arkham/X Earlier this month, it was reported that BlackRock’s spot market BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) saw a record number of outflows. At the time, it was found that the firm’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) witnessed $332.6 million worth of outflows on January 2nd, the largest day on record. In November, it was found that IBIT had surpassed BlackRock’s gold ETF (IAU) in terms of net assets – reaching over $33 billion – despite the gold ETF launching nearly two decades earlier in 2005.

While the DeFi token has shown some stability in the last 24 hours, certain market indicators suggest the bearish storm may be far from over. Related Reading: DeFi Exploits Plunge 40% In 2024, But Centralized Exchange Losses Soar – Report AAVE Could Crash By 30% If Signal Holds In a recent post on social media platform X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared a hawkish prediction on the AAVE market. According to Martinez, the TD Sequential indicator has presented a sell signal on the AAVE weekly chart, suggesting a major decline on the horizon. In trading, the TD Sequential developed by Tom DeMark is used to identify potential turning points in price trades. It basically indicates when an asset’s price is overextended in a particular direction and due for a reversal. Based on Martinez’s forecast, if the TD Sequential sell signal holds, AAVE could undergo a significant correction falling to around $264. However, in the presence of overwhelming selling pressure, the L2 token could be headed for $203, indicating a possible 29.5% decline from AAVE’s current price. Interestingly, this bearish prediction is backed by other indicators. Firstly, Relative Strength Index indicator has a value of 62.57 indicating that AAVE is still far from the oversold zone and may experience further decline in the coming weeks. Furthermore, the asset’s 100-day simple average is also far below the current price which can be interpreted as another bearish signal. Clearly, there’s much need to apply caution in engaging the present market. At press time, AAVE trades at $290.04 after a slight 2.48% gain in the last 24 hours. However, its daily trading volume has dipped by 48.99% which may potentially indicate that selling pressure is beginning to ease up. Related Reading: Altcoins Surge As Crypto Market Kicks Off 2025 On A High Note Aave Set To Launch V4 Despite the ongoing price struggle, the Aave protocol continues to record positive development.

In addition to this, the DeFi protocol is preparing to launch its V4 network upgrade that is expected to introduce advanced risk tools and unified liquidity among other benefits. According to data from DeFiilama, AAVE continues to rank as the second largest DeFi protocol with a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $20.4 billion. The decentralized lending platform falls only behind liquid staking protocol Lido Finance which boasts of a TVL of $31.60 billion.

A pastor based in Miami who leads a Spanish-language church in Washington, he has been accused of using the trust of his congregation to further his scam. Faith Meets Fraud Pinillo, the leader of Ministerio Apostólico Profético Tiempos de Poder, touted Solano Fi as a “safe and guaranteed investment.” He promised an improbable 34.9% monthly return and convinced his congregants and other investors to invest their hard-earned money with him. His high-pitched selling, he said, was divinely inspired by a vision. And he had an eager audience. Social Media Blitz To expand his network, Pinillo used social networks. He created a Solano Fi page on Facebook and a Telegram chat group, “Multimillionarios SolanoFi,” with over 1,500 members. The scheme also promised irresistible referral fees of 15%, to create a pyramid-like scheme where new money was used to pay phony returns to earlier investors. How the Scheme Worked Fake Gains, Real Losses The DOJ said Pinillo’s promises were a mirage. Instead, he diverted the money into accounts in the names of himself and his associates. Victims were shown fake balances on some sort of online platform that was designed to show growth but avoid withdrawals. Excuses and Evasions When investors tried to cash out, Pinillo blamed everything from problems with the website to market declines. In other cases, he allegedly asked victims to bring in new investors to “buy out” their accounts in order to further the fraud. Justice Awaits Criminal and Civil Cases Pinillo now faces 26 counts of fraud, each punishable by up to 20 years in prison. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed its own civil charges, claiming he catered to vulnerable, Spanish-speaking parishioners. A Message from Authorities “Fraudulent investment schemes are nothing new, but cryptocurrency scams are a new method fraudsters steal money from hardworking, honest people,” said U.S. Attorney Vanessa Waldref.

However, a noticeable shift is underway, with WIF holders now turning their attention to 1Fuel (OFT) . Currently in its presale stage, 1Fuel has sold over 133 million tokens and is offering an attractive entry point for investors. Could 1Fuel be the next big crypto success story? Let’s take a closer look. DogWifHat Value Drops Sharply in the Past Month DogWifHat (WIF) took the crypto world by storm in 2024, delivering an astounding 1187.77% value increase. However, the token’s recent performance has left many concerned, as its value has dropped sharply in the past month. In this period, WIF has experienced a staggering 47.59% decline, with a 27% reduction occurring in the first week of January 2025. Even with this downturn, investors are highly optimistic and they believe that WIF could eventually recover, hitting the $6 mark. If achieved, it could become one of the best investments of 2025. Those holding their tokens in Ledger and Core Wallet are monitoring the market closely, hoping for a turnaround. Crypto Holders Turn Towards 1Fuel in Its Presale Crypto holders ar shifting their focus to 1Fuel (OFT) during its presale phase, seizing the opportunity to buy at its lowest price of $0.015. Despite not being publicly listed yet, the token has already attracted significant attention from WIF holders and other investors. Analysts have projected an impressive 100x growth once 1Fuel is publicly listed, positioning it as one of the best investments of 2025. The presale has proven to be a major success, with over 133 million tokens sold and $1.2 million raised in record time. This makes the presale a prime opportunity for investors to buy into the token. Early adopters also receive exclusive bonuses and priority access to 1Fuel’s crypto card upon listing. One of the reasons why 1Fuel is attracting attention is its cross-chain DEX wallet, which sets it apart from platforms like Ledger and Core Wallet. 1Fuel Cross-Chain Wallet Gains Traction The 1Fuel cross-chain DEX wallet is attracting a lot of attention among crypto investors, especially with its advanced features. It’s easy for investors to interact across different blockchains with 1Fuel, whether a beginner or experienced trader. Unlike traditional wallets like Ledger and Core Wallet, 1Fuel wallet offers a seamless one-click solution for cross-chain transactions. Additionally, the wallet supports P2P exchanges, allowing users to trade directly with peers, reducing transaction fees. When it comes to privacy, 1Fuel goes beyond the capabilities of Ledger and Core Wallet. With inbuilt mixers and disposable wallets, 1Fuel offers anonymity to investors, making it excellent for investors who are prioritizing privacy in their transactions. Most competitors lack the advanced anonymity tools that 1Fuel offers. Another standout feature of the DEX wallet is the single asset requirement, which eliminates the need to hold multiple cryptocurrencies for different networks. Users only need to hold 1Fuel for all their transaction needs. Furthermore, it integrates financial tools such as debit and credit card support, P2P exchange, and AI-driven asset management, offering a comprehensive ecosystem for managing digital assets.

However, a noticeable shift is underway, with WIF holders now turning their attention to 1Fuel (OFT) . Currently in its presale stage, 1Fuel has sold over 133 million tokens and is offering an attractive entry point for investors. Could 1Fuel be the next big crypto success story? Let’s take a closer look. DogWifHat Value Drops Sharply in the Past Month DogWifHat (WIF) took the crypto world by storm in 2024, delivering an astounding 1187.77% value increase. However, the token’s recent performance has left many concerned, as its value has dropped sharply in the past month. In this period, WIF has experienced a staggering 47.59% decline, with a 27% reduction occurring in the first week of January 2025. Even with this downturn, investors are highly optimistic and they believe that WIF could eventually recover, hitting the $6 mark. If achieved, it could become one of the best investments of 2025. Those holding their tokens in Ledger and Core Wallet are monitoring the market closely, hoping for a turnaround. Crypto Holders Turn Towards 1Fuel in Its Presale Crypto holders ar shifting their focus to 1Fuel (OFT) during its presale phase, seizing the opportunity to buy at its lowest price of $0.015. Despite not being publicly listed yet, the token has already attracted significant attention from WIF holders and other investors. Analysts have projected an impressive 100x growth once 1Fuel is publicly listed, positioning it as one of the best investments of 2025. The presale has proven to be a major success, with over 133 million tokens sold and $1.2 million raised in record time. This makes the presale a prime opportunity for investors to buy into the token. Early adopters also receive exclusive bonuses and priority access to 1Fuel’s crypto card upon listing. One of the reasons why 1Fuel is attracting attention is its cross-chain DEX wallet, which sets it apart from platforms like Ledger and Core Wallet. 1Fuel Cross-Chain Wallet Gains Traction The 1Fuel cross-chain DEX wallet is attracting a lot of attention among crypto investors, especially with its advanced features. It’s easy for investors to interact across different blockchains with 1Fuel, whether a beginner or experienced trader. Unlike traditional wallets like Ledger and Core Wallet, 1Fuel wallet offers a seamless one-click solution for cross-chain transactions. Additionally, the wallet supports P2P exchanges, allowing users to trade directly with peers, reducing transaction fees. When it comes to privacy, 1Fuel goes beyond the capabilities of Ledger and Core Wallet. With inbuilt mixers and disposable wallets, 1Fuel offers anonymity to investors, making it excellent for investors who are prioritizing privacy in their transactions. Most competitors lack the advanced anonymity tools that 1Fuel offers. Another standout feature of the DEX wallet is the single asset requirement, which eliminates the need to hold multiple cryptocurrencies for different networks. Users only need to hold 1Fuel for all their transaction needs. Furthermore, it integrates financial tools such as debit and credit card support, P2P exchange, and AI-driven asset management, offering a comprehensive ecosystem for managing digital assets.

However, that momentum has slowed. Now, investors are shifting their focus to a new altcoin with 100x potential — Rollblock. Let’s see how this rising project plans to outshine Dogecoin and Solana! Rollblock Plans On Doubling Revenue in January Rollblock is a GambleFi protocol focused on solving the persistent issues of fraud and scams in online gambling. To achieve this, it leverages blockchain technology and cryptocurrency by moving all its games on-chain. This ensures that every wager placed is encrypted and stored securely on-chain, eliminating any possibility of tampering. This emphasis on trust and safety has proven effective in attracting users. In December alone, Rollblock recorded over $1.75 million in wagers, and analysts predict that figure could double by January. With more than 7,000 AI-powered games, sports betting, and live dealers, Rollblock is emerging as a disruptive force in the $450 billion traditional gambling market. The entire ecosystem is powered by Rollblock’s native utility token, RBLK. Analysts predict that RBLK could deliver a 100x return by the end of 2025. Currently priced at $0.045, the token is in its ninth presale stage, having already raised over $8.5 million. Early investors have seen returns of over 300% so far. What sets RBLK apart from other altcoins like Solana and Dogecoin is Rollblock’s revenue-sharing model. The protocol allocates 30% of its revenue to buying RBLK from the open market. Of those tokens, 60% are burned to reduce supply, while the remaining 40% are distributed as staking rewards, offering some of the highest APYs on the market. The entire Rollblock ecosystem operates under the protection of a SolidProof audit and a license issued by the Anjouan e-gaming authority, ensuring a secure and reliable platform for its users. Will Solana Rally Post Ecosystem Updates? Solana faces short-term bearish pressure, with its price down 2.40% to $190 and trading volume dropping 27.4% to $4.08B. Key support is around $180, with resistance at $210. A breakout above this could trigger bullish momentum toward $300, a target predicted by analysts like Iced. The blockchain’s ecosystem continues to attract institutional investors. VanEck’s push for Solana ETF approval and the network’s high-speed, low-cost infrastructure make it a strong candidate for future growth. However, regulatory hurdles and competition from Ethereum remain challenges. Solana’s near-term outlook depends on its ability to maintain scalability improvements and institutional adoption with ETF developments expected to significantly impact price fluctuations. Will Dogecoin Reach $1 This Cycle? Dogecoin is holding steady at around $0.32 after a sharp 15% drop over the last 30 days. The recent market sell-off weighed heavily on memecoins, but Dogecoin has managed to defend this key support level. Despite the price drop, open interest in Dogecoin futures remains at $3.4 billion, indicating that many traders are holding their positions. A short squeeze could drive DOGE toward $0.40 if buyers regain control. For now, Dogecoin is holding above the 200-day moving average at $0.284, which supports a bullish case. However, if it drops below that level, a fall to $0.28 is possible. The next key resistance level sits at $0.378, where a breakout could signal a strong recovery. Can Rollblock Deliver a 50x Return? Experts believe that if Rollblock continues hitting key milestones, RBLK could become this year’s first 100x gem. The token has already delivered a return of over 300% since the start of its presale and is expected to reach $1 once it enters the open market and more liquidity flows in. If that price level is reached, Rollblock will overthrow Dogecoin and will be a step closer to Solana in the top cryptos by market cap.

Among them, a new meme coin captures attention with its potential to explode in value. Starting at a mere $0.0008, this coin’s trajectory suggests a significant leap, sparking curiosity and interest in its growth prospects throughout the year. Catzilla: Roaring into the meme coin arena with unmatched profit potential In the ever-evolving world of meme coins, new contenders constantly emerge, and Catzilla is positioning itself as an ambitious player. Drawing inspiration from successful tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) , Shiba Inu (SHIB) , and PEPE, Catzilla aims to blend viral meme culture with significant financial growth. What sets Catzilla apart is its unique storytelling — a giant, Godzilla-like cat wreaking havoc, which taps into the chaotic energy of Japanese kaiju culture. This game-based narrative not only engages gamers but attracts crypto investors looking for the next big thing. With a fiery combination of anime-inspired chaos and a rebellious mission, Catzilla is rallying crypto enthusiasts and cat lovers, and anime fans to join its movement for a more equitable, decentralized crypto space.

Catzilla’s presale offers a 14-stage process, giving investors multiple opportunities to buy in early. With each stage, the token price gradually rises. Unlock triple for maximum gains Catzilla operates on a threefold value proposition: epic gameplay, a unifying mission, and a vibrant community. Players can enjoy a thrilling game experience while earning rewards, all while being part of a growing movement that merges the fun of meme culture with the potential for financial freedom. Join the Catzilla movement Catzilla positions itself as a symbol of resistance against the greed and manipulation often seen in the crypto world. By embracing its bold and monstrous persona, Catzilla seeks to restore the playful, decentralized nature of meme coins while ensuring a fair and transparent ecosystem for its users. Synthetic dollar protocol: Ethena and the internet bond Ethena is a new kind of digital currency on Ethereum. It creates a stable, digital dollar without using traditional banks. Ethena aims to provide a secure, accessible digital money solution. The platform also offers an innovative savings option called the ‘Internet Bond,’ which allows global access to dollar-denominated savings. This bond provides a way for people to maintain value in a digital form. Ethena’s focus on decentralization and stability is appealing, especially during market changes. This makes it an attractive option for those interested in digital currencies that operate independently of traditional financial systems. The coin’s potential lies in its ability to offer stable, secure digital savings and transactions. Chill Guy: The meme symbol of relaxed vibes Chill Guy is a popular meme character known for his relaxed and carefree attitude. Dressed in a grey sweater, blue jeans, and red shoes, his smirk and hands-in-pockets pose capture a laid-back vibe. This character has gained popularity on platforms like TikTok for representing calm and ease amidst a busy world. He inspires mindfulness and inner peace, promoting the idea that it’s okay to take life easy. The movement encourages people to adopt a less stressful and more enjoyable approach to daily life. Chill Guy embodies the art of staying cool and collected, resonating with those seeking to embrace a lowkey lifestyle. Solana: A scalable blockchain with unique features Solana is a blockchain platform that focuses on scalability and decentralized applications. It competes with Ethereum and Cardano by offering faster transactions and flexible development across various programming languages. Its native cryptocurrency, SOL, is essential for its ecosystem. SOL facilitates transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards network participants. Solana does not use sharding or second-layer solutions, which makes it distinctive. This approach aims to attract both developers and investors by offering high-capacity potential. The coin holds value within this ecosystem and is important for accessing diverse projects on the platform. These features may make Solana and SOL appealing in the current market cycle. Shiba Inu: Ethereum-based meme coin with broad utility potential Shiba Inu is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by the pseudonymous developer Ryoshi, SHIB initially had a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens. A noteworthy event involved half of these tokens being sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. This move increased trust within the crypto community. Buterin later donated a portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and “burned” 40% of it, impacting SHIB’s profile. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB leverages Ethereum’s ecosystem, enabling it to develop applications such as ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Plans are in place for a future NFT platform and DAO governance, enhancing its versatility beyond a memecoin. Conclusion While ENA, CHILLGUY, SOL, and SHIB show promise, their short-term potential appears limited. In contrast, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero, offering a 700% ROI during its presale. With triple utility—governance rights, loyalty rewards, and passive staking—Catzilla aims to unite crypto enthusiasts to fight for financial freedom and challenge toxic systems.

A strong negotiation there should determine the price movement next. Avax has seen a series of ups and downs in the past month, although the bears have been gaining more control than expected as they continue to pull lower. So far, it has lost roughly 20% from the recent top, and at the time of writing, there are no signs of stopping bearishness. However, the price is slowly reaching a critical support level of $35 as selling pressure drops a bit on the daily chart. This critical support level is considered where the next major direction is likely to take place. If the bulls act upon this support by defending it well, we can anticipate a fresh increase with a double-bottom formation on the daily chart. This should fuel a strong bullish move, which may explode the price to a new high. Otherwise, we may see a breakdown to confirm further bearish move. Such a scenario could completely wash off the late 2024 gains within a blink, painting a catastrophic loss in the short term. Now that the bullish bias is temporarily fading in the short term due to low demand, it is important to note that the bearish dominance might get stronger amid rising supply. Avax’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview A break below the mentioned critical support could bring us back to $33.6 – last month’s low. The lower level to consider for more sell-offs is $30.6, followed by the $27.2 level. Should the buyers intercept the latest move, Avax may bounce back to retake the lost $40 level along with the weekly $45 high. Surpassing this level could fuel more recoveries to $50 and potentially $55.5.

It has recovered briefly but still looks weak daily as it brews for a bigger sell-off. Altcoins are seriously falling out again as the primary cryptocurrency short-lived its recovery this week, making another sharp downturn to form a bearish (double-top) pattern on the daily chart. DOT reacted negatively to the move and the price nosedived on Tuesday to a low of $6.4 yesterday. It has recovered briefly from that low and now trades at round $6.6, gathering momentum for another leg down. No doubt that the bears have now regained dominance, but it is noteworthy to say there is still hope for a rebound as the bull cycle is not over yet sentimentally. Aside from that, their footprints are still evident in the market from a technical standpoint. Psychologically, the dump looks much more like a market manipulation, which is providing more discount for buying in the near term. If supply level increases, things may get uglier in the next few days while the bears claim more lows. The main target level for such a sell is $4, where it started to surge last November. A further drop below this level will put the market in a more bearish condition. Traders and investors are currently pessimistic of current move as it maintained a lower low and lower high pattern. DOT’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Advancing bearishness in the next few days, DOT may reclaim the last month’s $6 support level with a potential break down to $5.55 and $4.7 in the future. A reestablished support above that last month’s support could bring a recovery in the market. But for now, the immediate resistance level is located at $8, followed by $9.67 and $11.65 in case of a major buyback. Key Resistance Levels: $8, $9.67, $11.65 Key Support Levels: $6, $5.55, $4.7 Spot Price: $6.66 Trend: Bearish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Derivatives markets data shows DOGE traders reluctant to close out their positions with Trump’s inauguration now 1 week away. Dogecoin price consolidates at $0.35 as traders await further clarity Dogecoin (DOGE) remains under pressure as its price consolidates near $0.33 on January 12. The cryptocurrency’s price action reflects broader market concerns, with events such as FTX liquidations and the potential U.S. government sell-off of Silk Road-related Bitcoin holdings weighing heavily on investor sentiment. Dogecoin Price Action | DOGEUSD DOGE price faced a steep 18% decline between January 5 and January 9, dropping from $0.39 to $0.32 during a period of heightened market sell-offs. However, the meme coin managed a modest 5% rebound, climbing to $0.35 before encountering resistance. At press time, DOGE has slipped back to $0.33, reflecting continued hesitancy among traders to commit to long positions amid prevailing uncertainty. Dogecoin Open Interest Crosses $3.5B as Traders take fresh Positions ahead of Trump Inauguration Despite a period of price consolidation, speculative bets suggest that strategic Dogecoin traders are preparing for potential bullish triggers linked to upcoming events. Confirming this narrative, the Coinglass Open Interest chart below tracks the total value of capital currently invested in unsettled DOGE futures contracts. Dogecoin Open Interest vs. DOGE Price | Source: Coinglass DOGE price has risen by 7% over the past three days, climbing from $0.31 to $0.33. However, the 9.5% increase in Open Interest, from $3.24 billion to $3.55 billion, has significantly outpaced the price movement. This divergence suggests that traders are increasingly placing leveraged bets on potential upside rather than exiting positions despite stagnant price action. Key narratives driving this surge in speculative positions include the newly established the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) initiative and Elon Musk’s continued involvement in Trump’s administration. With Trump’s Inauguration on January 20 now one week away, this 9.5% surge in Open Interest indicates renewed trader enthusiasm, as both long and short positions are being actively built in anticipation of a volatility spike. If these speculative bets align with a bullish market response to Trump’s inauguration, DOGE could experience a breakout from its consolidation zone near $0.35. DOGE Price Forecast: $0.40 Breakout Potential Hinges on Key Indicators With Trump’s inauguration on the horizon, Dogecoin price forecast paints a positive outlook. Technical indicators show DOGE is currently consolidating near $0.34, with traders eying the upper Bollinger Band (BB) at $0.39 as a pivotal resistance level. The BB width suggests reduced volatility, implying that DOGE may be coiling for a breakout. Trading volume at 456.11 million, coupled with a mild recovery in the Bull-Bear Power (BBP) indicator at -0.01235, hints at stabilizing market sentiment after DOGE’s recent plunge and subsequent 7% rebound. Dogecoin price forecast | DOGEUSD A bullish scenario could unfold if DOGE sustains momentum above the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of $0.3395. This would target the $0.39 resistance and potentially pave the way for a rally toward $0.40. Increased volume and positive BBP movement would validate this breakout, aligning with market optimism surrounding upcoming events. Conversely, a bearish breakdown below $0.33, accompanied by declining volume, could reintroduce selling pressure, potentially retesting the lower BB limit at $0.28. DOGE must hold its current consolidation to avoid a bearish reversal.

Locating support after a short pullback, it is footing a fresh increase on the daily chart and now looks set for a breakup. The past month’s trading has been rough in the overall market as several altcoins undergo major corrections, though SUI managed to sustain its bullish trend with slight pullbacks but buying pressure now appears low. However, it fell briefly to $4.3 amid this week’s drops but is now jerking up again after respecting the rising trendline, which has been acting as dynamic support in the last five months. As seen on the daily chart, the price currently sits at $5.1 as it slowly charges to claim a new high. A significant break above $5.5 should set the stage for another big rally, but the recent volatility contraction may slow down the move as demand drops. But if we consider the ongoing build-up, the bulls are much more likely to sustain the momentum in the short term. Looking at the recent decline in the daily volume indicator, which shows signs of money outflow since late December, the asset may start to see a broad retracement anytime soon. Such a scenario could end the existing bullish momentum when the price breaks below the rising support line. SUI Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview As SUI continues to show strength, the next target level is $6. A surge through this level could rally the price to $8 and majorly the $10 level. If by any chance the crypto loses grip, a break below the rising trendline could crash the price to the $4 and $2.97 support levels. There’s also support at $2.37 for a major retracement move.

Press time data suggests that while there’s an outflow of liquidity from these altcoins, there’s an inflow into 1Fuel, which led it to hit a new milestone, selling its presale phase 2 for $1.18 million and currently on track to $2 million. Analysts predict its launch after these multiple stages will yield 50-100x. Liquidity gradually moves away from DOGE Analysts’ expectations for DOGE during this rally remain minimal as they believe the asset is almost at its peak soon thus posing little to no benefits for investors. According to these analysts with years of experience in the market, they highlighted that DOGE will experience a notable 2-3x rally, largely influenced by Donald Trump and Elon Musk. With the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), a special agency focusing on improving government workflow and ensuring accountability being launched and mimicking DOGE’s name, there will be an impact on the asset’s price. Similarly, Musk’s Tesla approving DOGE for transactions will also contribute to its success in the coming future. Based on these analysts’ anticipation, DOGE’s price movement from its current price market capitalization of $49.41 billion doesn’t exceed $149 billion at most, fulfilling the threefold move from its current threshold. This move remains unsatisfactory for investors looking to gain big from this current bull run, as missing out will mean waiting another four years before getting the next rally opportunity. Investors have since begun allocating a significant portion of their capital to 1Fuel, believing its utility and its current large purchases will spark demand in the coming days. 1Fuel to gain 50x as DOGE momentum fails 1Fuel has begun attracting investor funding as market sentiment shifts to utility tokens with high potential for massive returns this cycle. 1Fuel’s utility stems from its cryptocurrency wallet that provides a much more innovative way to trade and interact in the crypto scene. The benefits appear limitless, with several use cases. The cross-chain composability and security features will make it stand out. With cross-chain composability, users have the option to transact across different chains seamlessly. For example, sending USDT on Ethereum to USDT on Arbitrum happens in just one click with minimal fees, eliminating hurdles. With the security feature, 1Fuel makes it easy for traders to secure their funds without hassle or the high risks associated with other accounts. For one, there’s a cold storage option that allows users to store funds offline and a privacy mixer to safeguard funds.

ADA joined the party, but there’s no assurance that the bulls can sustain it. The next major direction still looks dicey. ADA’s overall market structure remains bullish on the macro level but the bears appear to be in control as the market currently undergoes a retracement from a short-term perspective. However, it appeared to be following Bitcoin’s pattern on the short-term scale, and as we can see, the price is recovering today due to minor gains in the past hours. Although it is uncertain if the recovery will last long. A climb back above this week’s high could restore the market’s strength. However, the bulls’ commitment is currently low, so it is difficult to determine whether a comeback will manifest. Technically, ADA’s supply still appears heavy daily. Just like the recent one, the current price recovery could lead to another bullish trap if it is short-lived under $1.15. The recent double-top pattern indicates a potential bearish move, which could trigger a major retracement in the next few days. As a result, we might need to wait for a clear cross above the November high before we can confirm a bullish continuation. A weekly price close will most likely determine where the market will head next. ADA’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview The current daily recovery may end at $1. If the price increases above this week’s $1.152 high, the next key target resistance would be $1.326 – tested last November. A break there should set the price up for a bigger gain. $1.5 and $2 are levels to watch. Breaking below the $0.85 level would confirm a bearish move to $0.765 and $0.69 in no time. The lower support level to consider for a test would be $0.6 and $0.522. Key Resistance Levels: $1.152, $1.32, $1.5 Key Support Levels: $0.765, $0.69, $0.6 Price: $0.96 Trend: Bearish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

According to Onchain data, a crypto wallet bought MLG, an unknown memecoin, exactly nine months ago. The patient “diamond-handed” whale paid only 17 SOL for this transaction, or $2,600 at the time, and bought 40.81 million MLG. The whale sold 33.3 million of these tokens in small sales during the intervening period, making sales worth $413,000. However, today, the value of the 7.51 million MLG that the whale did not sell is currently around $962,000. Related News: Michael Saylor Strikes Again - He Made a New Post, Gave a Secret Message In other words, during this period, the crypto whale made a profit of $1.3 million when the realized and unrealized gains were calculated in total, and increased his initial capital by 529 times. However, there are also claims that this crypto whale is one of MLG's development team, that is, an “insider trader,” so one should also be careful with this altcoin. *This is not investment advice.

Are markets at risk again?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/earnings-week-wall-street-risk-again/,"Wall Street is on edge. The big banks—Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Wells Fargo—are about to release their earnings, and the stakes couldn’t be higher. Jefferies Financial Group already kicked off the season with numbers that disappointed the market. Combine that with a shockingly strong jobs report last week, and you’ve got investors biting their nails. The Federal Reserve isn’t cutting interest rates anytime soon, thanks to those job numbers, and that means the market is in for a bumpy ride. Last year, bank stocks crushed it, climbing 33% and leaving the S&P 500 in the dust. But that was 2024. This year is already shaping up to be a different story. Expectations are high, sure, but so are the risks. Banks thrived on a booming stock market, a wave of deals, and easy money policies. Now, every move from the Fed and every word from bank executives about the future is under a microscope. Big expectations, bigger questions The last quarter of 2024 wasn’t exactly quiet. Election-fueled volatility shook up the markets, keeping trading desks busier than usual. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said December didn’t follow the usual script. There wasn’t the typical slowdown in activity, which could mean a bump in trading revenues. Citigroup and JPMorgan have already hinted that their numbers might look good because of this. Investors are hoping that’s true, but there’s a lot more riding on these reports. Investment banking revenue and profit margins didn’t hit Wall Street’s expectations. That’s a big deal because a strong year for initial public offerings (IPOs) was supposed to help boost bank profits. But market volatility and the specter of tariffs under the incoming Trump administration are throwing cold water on those hopes. Still, some analysts are optimistic. Barclays’ Jason Goldberg thinks Trump’s pro-business policies—tax cuts, deregulation, you name it—could be game changers. But not everyone is buying the hype. Borrowing remains weak, and corporations are holding back, waiting to see how the political and economic situation shapes up. But with expenses rising, the math has to work. Banks need to prove they can grow revenue faster than costs, or the market won’t be forgiving. The Fed, the market, and the inflation puzzle The Federal Reserve isn’t making things easier. Last week, Boston Fed President Susan Collins made it clear that interest rates aren’t moving down anytime soon. “Considerable uncertainty” is the phrase she used to describe the economic outlook. Inflation is slowing, but not fast enough. The Fed’s favorite gauge showed prices up 2.4% in November, with core inflation at 2.8%. Both are still above the central bank’s 2% target, so rate cuts are off the table for now. Higher bond yields are good news for banks—on paper, at least. They boost net interest income and profit margins. But there’s a flip side: higher yields mean more pressure on consumers. Household budgets are already stretched, and this could slow down borrowing even more. For banks, that’s a double-edged sword. Sure, they make more on the money they lend, but they also lend less when consumers and businesses tighten their belts. Investors are also worried about the broader market. Last Friday, the S&P 500 had its worst day since December 18, dropping 1.5%. The KBW Bank Index, which tracks the biggest bank stocks, fell 2.7%. That’s not the kind of momentum you want heading into earnings week. If the big banks don’t deliver solid results—or at least reassure investors about the future—things could get uglier. Fed officials aren’t exactly singing a happy tune, either. Michelle Bowman, a Fed governor, shared Collins’ cautious stance. She said rate cuts won’t happen until inflation shows real progress. And even then, don’t expect a rapid turnaround. The Fed is taking its time, and that means banks and investors will have to adjust to a slower, more deliberate policy approach.

January is shaping up to be a pivotal month for blockchain projects that are redefining the market. With innovative technologies and real-world applications, the best coins to join this month are setting the stage for high growth and significant market potential in 2025 and beyond. Among these is Qubetics ($TICS), a standout project tackling some of the biggest challenges in blockchain development with its innovative QubeQode IDE. But Qubetics isn’t alone—this list highlights three other coins poised for big things in January. Let’s dive into these high-potential altcoins that are leading the way. 1. Qubetics ($TICS) Simplifies Blockchain Development With Its QubeQode IDE Qubetics is rewriting the rules of blockchain development with its revolutionary QubeQode IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Creating blockchain applications often requires extensive technical expertise and coding skills, which limits adoption for businesses and developers. QubeQode eliminates these barriers by offering an intuitive, visual development environment with drag-and-drop components, form-based configuration, and a robust code snippet library. Imagine you’re a small business owner who wants to integrate blockchain-based authentication or token management into your app but lacks the resources to hire a full development team. QubeQode makes this possible by allowing you to drag and drop pre-built functionalities like user authentication or data storage directly into your application. For larger enterprises, the code snippet library simplifies complex tasks, saving both time and money. For instance, a healthcare startup could use QubeQode to develop a blockchain-powered patient data system. By using pre-built components, the team can focus on delivering a secure, efficient solution without spending months writing code from scratch. Similarly, developers creating NFT marketplaces or DeFi platforms can benefit from faster deployment and scalability, giving them a competitive edge. Currently, the Qubetics presale is in its 16th stage, with tokens priced at $0.0455. Over 411 million $TICS tokens have already been sold, raising more than $9.2 million from a growing community of 14,000 holders. The presale lasts just seven days per stage, with prices increasing by 10% every Sunday at midnight, making this the perfect time to join. Why this coin made it to this list: Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE transforms blockchain development, while its presale momentum offers short-term opportunities for gains. 2. Render Network (RNDR) Powers Creative Industries With Decentralized Rendering Render Network has emerged as a leading platform for decentralised rendering, enabling creators to leverage idle GPU power from across the globe for rendering tasks. This technology is a game-changer for industries like gaming, film, and virtual reality, where high-quality rendering is essential. Imagine you’re an independent filmmaker working on a complex animation project. Traditionally, rendering would take weeks and cost a fortune. Render Network allows you to access affordable, high-speed rendering services, cutting down production time and costs significantly. This decentralised approach also provides income opportunities for GPU owners, making it a win-win for both creators and contributors. Recent partnerships with creative platforms and advancements in its ecosystem have positioned Render Network as a critical player in the digital content space. Its focus on solving real-world challenges in creative industries makes it a compelling short-term investment option. Why this coin made it to this list: Render Network’s innovative approach to decentralised rendering positions it for rapid growth in creative industries. 3. Gala (GALA) Fuels the Growth of Blockchain Gaming Gala has become a major player in blockchain gaming, focusing on creating a decentralised platform where developers can build and gamers can play immersive games. By incorporating blockchain technology, Gala empowers players with true ownership of in-game assets, which they can trade or sell for real value. Imagine being a gamer who spends hours collecting rare items in a game. Instead of those assets being locked within the game’s ecosystem, Gala ensures that you own them entirely. This model not only rewards players for their time but also creates a thriving secondary market for in-game assets. Gala’s recent expansion into new gaming titles and partnerships with developers has bolstered its ecosystem. As blockchain gaming gains traction, Gala’s innovative platform positions it as a leader in this rapidly growing space. Why this coin made it to this list: Gala combines blockchain technology and gaming, offering short-term opportunities in a fast-expanding market. 4. Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) Unlocks the Value of Data Ocean Protocol is redefining how data is shared, stored, and monetised. By creating a decentralised marketplace for data, Ocean allows individuals and organisations to securely share information while retaining ownership and control. Imagine you’re a researcher working on a groundbreaking AI model. Access to diverse datasets is critical, but traditional data-sharing methods often involve high costs and security risks. Ocean Protocol’s marketplace enables you to buy or sell data securely, unlocking valuable resources while ensuring privacy. Recent updates to its platform and increasing adoption in sectors like healthcare and finance have propelled Ocean Protocol into the spotlight. Its unique focus on data monetisation and security makes it a standout in the blockchain ecosystem. Why this coin made it to this list: Ocean Protocol’s decentralised data marketplace and growing adoption make it a top choice for short-term gains. Closing Thoughts on January’s Top Picks As January kicks off a promising year for cryptocurrency, these best coins to join this month offer an incredible mix of innovation, real-world application, and market growth potential. Qubetics ($TICS) is leading the way with its QubeQode IDE, simplifying blockchain development for businesses and developers, while Render Network, Gala, and Ocean Protocol tackle unique challenges in creative industries, gaming, and data monetisation. The Qubetics’ top crypto presale is a golden opportunity, with its current stage offering tokens at $0.0455 before the next 10% price hike this Sunday at midnight. Don’t miss the chance to join these market leaders and set your portfolio up for a high-growth year. January is the time to act—secure your spot in these innovative projects today.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Investors cheer as Cardano and XRP rally, but FXGuys steals the spotlight with 150% ROI and 100x listing potential. Table of Contents Cardano whales are egging The DeFi surge FXGuys: Unique DeFi experience with proprietary trading Rising open interest sparks a Ripple surge The FXG presale token can beat top altcoins in 2025 The market woes from Yuletide are finally over, and investors are excited about the new year’s prospects. And even more so now that most top altcoins, especially Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP), are off to remarkable profits. However, a new DeFi token is stealing the show with its appeal. FXGuys (FXG) is offering 150% in presale ROI and a further potential 100x pump when it lists on the major crypto exchanges. Read on for more on the FXGuys presale! Cardano whales are egging The DeFi surge Cardano’s ADA had been, more or less, a relatively forgotten coin, owing to its trading below 50 cents for about 3 years prior. Still, it was a case of opportunity to meet a prepared DeFi token when Bitcoin surged in November 2024. Cardano’s ADA spiked over the dollar mark after Bitcoin moved above $100,000, and the ADA price has been closely shadowing the top crypto ever since. That close relationship and the recent whale involvement on Cardano are about to create quite the surge for ADA to hit new ceilings. According to analyst Ali on Twitter/X, Cardano Whales bought 10 million tokens in the 24-hour run-up to January 7. The accumulation is sudden, but the token seems to be taking it all in stride. A price correction has pulled ADA down to $0.9893, but the token is still 15.89% up weekly. ADA investors can expect more decent gains, but the FX Guys presale is where the real profits are. You might also like: Avalanche and TRON holders spot generational wealth opportunity in FXGuys FXGuys: Unique DeFi experience with proprietary trading The FXGuys platform features appropriate products for traders, investors, and even simple token holders, equipping its FXG presale token with enough utilities to set it up for a potential 100x pump. For traders and investors, there’s the proprietary trading scheme for funding talented traders who might not have the funding to maximize their profits. In that case, investors deposit their idle funds in the Trader Funding Program, and the traders take and pass simulation challenges and get funded. Traders keep 80% of the gains from these funded trades, while the capital and the remaining 20% of the profits go to the investors as passive income. Traders can also accumulate FXG tokens through their activity, as the FX Guys platform rewards them with FXG tokens every time they complete a trade. The trade doesn’t even have to be profitable; they only have to engage the platform and get compensated for their activity. Investors and token holders have the stake protocol to explore. Only a few projects offer a 20% APY as staking yields for the year. FXGuys is one of them, and with the proprietary trading gains, investors could be in for a real treat on the FX Guys project. Rising open interest sparks a Ripple surge XRP is getting closer to a much-needed rally, as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will get a new head in a few days. With that in mind, there’s a high chance of a Ripple rally this month. At $2.29, the XRP price is 7.29% up from the past week, and Open Interest is still flying high. Ripple’s OI is up, and analysts are drawing parallels with XRP’s price history. Historically, such spikes are associated with Ripple surges, as the 100% OI surge in 2023 caused a 107% pump on XRP. Now that there’s so much interest in Ripple, the XRP token could soon spike above its current level. The FXG presale token can beat top altcoins in 2025 It’s the first bull run in the new year, and top altcoins like ADA and XRP are bracing to set new ATHs. While such a rally would be impressive for the average investor, more experienced investors are opting for FXGuys’ presale token, riding on the warm reception of its proprietary trading features. The DeFi token is already receiving considerable support as the belief in its 100x price pump potential continues to grow. Investors have invested over $3.5 million, and the public presale is only in Stage 2. What’s also impressive is that the FXG presale token is still priced at $0.04. And with the launch price already set at $0.10, smart investors can make a 150% ROI before the presale token even launches. Aim high. Go for the bigger gains with FXG!

While Pepe previously experienced significant growth, its momentum has slowed, paving the way for 1Fel. With its presale in full swing, 1Fuel has already sold millions of tokens, gaining investor confidence. This is especially due to its groundbreaking DeFi features that interest developers. Keep on reading to learn the full strength of 1Fuel’s potential. PEPE’s Community Hype Slowly Declines Like many meme coins, Pepe (PEPE) relies heavily on hype and community-driven interest to sustain its value. In 2023, this strategy seemed effective as PEPE’s price skyrocketed by over 1300%, drawing attention from investors. But the token’s popularity appears to be waning, much to the disappointment of its holders, including Trust Wallet and Ledger users. Over the past month, PEPE’s value has dropped by a concerning 29.59%, shocking investors who hoped the token would maintain its momentum. The decline continued into the first week of January 2025, with an additional 19.17% loss. Despite these setbacks, investors remain optimistic that PEPE would remain a top crypto to invest in. A New Altcoin Attracts Investor Attention A new altcoin, 1Fuel (OFT), is rapidly gaining traction among investors, thanks to its innovative DeFi features and practical utility. Unlike meme coins such as Pepe, which rely heavily on social media hype and community-driven interest, 1Fuel is distinguished by its strong foundation in decentralized finance. This increases its value as a reliable crypto to invest in. The 1Fuel DEX wallet offers seamless cross-chain transactions, allowing users to transact across different blockchain networks with a single click. This is a key advantage over Trust Wallet and Ledger, especially as you only need to hold 1Fuel for all your transaction needs. Privacy is another standout feature, driving growth to 1Fuel as a top DeFi altcoin. The wallet’s inbuilt mixer and disposable wallet options provide privacy tools that surpass those offered by Trust Wallet and Ledger. The wallet is also integrated with financial tools like crypto credit and debit cards, P2P exchange, and AI-driven insights. 1Fuel offers an attractive mix of practicality, innovation and long-term growth potential. Its ecosystem and DEX wallet is making the OFT token one of the most promising in the crypto space. Analysts Project 100X Growth for 1Fuel in 2025 The presale of 1Fuel (OFT) has taken the crypto world by storm, with over 133 million tokens already sold and more than $1.2 million raised. This remarkable progress has amplified the buzz surrounding this new altcoin. Priced at just $0.015 during the presale phase, 1Fuel is drawing significant interest as investors rush to secure the token at its lowest price before its listing. Analysts are optimistic about 1Fuel’s potential as a top DeFi altcoin, projecting a staggering 100x increase in value in 2025. 1Fuel’s appeal lies in its robust DeFi features and the functionality of its DEX wallet, making it a compelling crypto to invest in. The 1Fuel’s DEX wallet sets itself apart from competitors like Trust Wallet and Ledger, driving momentum for analysts and investors in the DeFi landscape. Investors Rush to 1Fuel’s Presale Investors have been rushing towards the 1Fuel live presale since the start, eager to secure it at the lowest price it would ever be. The token is backed by a reliable DEX wallet, and is expected to transform the crypto space. This is the perfect time for investors to buy the token as they anticipate high growth.

XYZ is still undervalued, and its presale offers a golden chance to secure life-changing gains. With major CEX and DEX listings on the horizon, the token is positioned for exponential growth, making this the perfect time to get in before the market catches on. Dogecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) is facing notable market fluctuations. Over the past week, its price has dipped slightly by 0.43%, while the last month brought a significant decline of 21.78%. However, over six months, DOGE has delivered a remarkable gain of 200.19%, reflecting its resilience in a volatile market. Currently trading between $0.33 and $0.42, DOGE’s nearest resistance is at $0.46, while support is found at $0.27. The 10-day simple moving average sits at $0.33, below the 100-day average of $0.37, highlighting recent bearish momentum. Technical indicators, including a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 27.94 and a Stochastic oscillator reading of 12.82, suggest DOGE may be oversold. The MACD at -0.0055 further supports the potential for a trend reversal. If DOGE breaks through the resistance at $0.46, it could target a second resistance at $0.55, representing a potential 66% gain from the lower end of its current range. However, a drop below $0.27 could lead to a second support at $0.1766, signaling a possible 46% decline. These movements underline the critical importance of market monitoring for DOGE’s next direction. Pepe Pepe (PEPE) has experienced significant movement recently. In the past week, its price dropped by 11.54%, and over the past month, it decreased by 35.50%. Despite this short-term decline, PEPE has surged by 97.01% over the last six months, showing substantial long-term growth. Currently, PEPE is trading between $0.00001813 and $0.00002258. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 29.77, indicating that the coin may be oversold. The Stochastic indicator is at 21.47, also suggesting potential oversold conditions. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.00001758, slightly below the 100-day SMA of $0.00001945, which could signal a potential upward correction. If the price begins to rise, the nearest resistance levels are at $0.00002445 and $0.00002890. Overcoming these could lead to further gains. On the downside, the nearest support levels are $0.00001555 and $0.00001110. A drop below these could result in additional declines. Based on these indicators and levels, PEPE might be poised for a rebound, potentially increasing by significant percentages if it breaks through resistance. Bonk Bonk (BONK) has seen a mix of highs and lows recently. Over the past week, its price fell by 7.93%. The drop is more significant over the past month, with a decrease of 29.83%. However, looking at the last six months, BONK’s price has actually risen by 21.28%. This suggests that despite recent declines, the coin has shown growth over a longer period. Currently, BONK is trading between $0.00002988 and $0.00003787. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.00002807, which is below the 100-day average of $0.00003205. This could indicate a bearish trend in the short term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 29.53, suggesting that the coin is oversold. The Stochastic value is 16.79, also pointing toward oversold conditions. The MACD level is negative, indicating bearish momentum. Looking ahead, BONK faces a resistance level at $0.00004138. If it climbs to this point, it could see a gain of around 25%. The next resistance is at $0.00004938. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.00002539, which would be a drop of about 23% from the current price. Below that, the second support level is $0.00001740. With indicators pointing to an oversold market, there’s potential for a rebound. Traders will be watching to see if BONK can break through resistance or if it will test support levels. FLOKI FLOKI (FLOKI) has experienced significant price fluctuations recently. In the past week, its price decreased by 9.05%. Over the past month, the decline is sharper at 32.54%. However, looking at the six-month period, the price has risen by 14.86%. This suggests that despite short-term losses, there has been long-term growth. Currently, FLOKI is trading between $0.00017695 and $0.00021285. The nearest resistance level is $0.00022655. If the price breaks above this point, it could approach the second resistance at $0.00026245, which would be an increase of about 23% from the current upper range. On the downside, the nearest support level is $0.00015475. Falling below this could lead to the second support at $0.00011885, a potential decrease of approximately 33% from the current lower range. Technical indicators provide mixed signals. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.00016519, which is below the 100-day average of $0.00018593, indicating a recent downtrend. The Relative Strength Index is at 29.45, placing it in oversold territory and suggesting a possible price rebound. The Stochastic value is 25.82, also pointing toward potential upward movement. However, the MACD level is negative at -0.0000025300, indicating bearish momentum. These factors suggest that FLOKI’s price could either recover or continue to decline in the short term. Conclusion While DOGE, PEPE, BONK, and FLOKI show promise, XYZVerse emerges as the leading meme coin, uniting sports fans and aiming for unprecedented growth through community engagement.

According to court documents, Pinillo is accused of collecting $5.9 million from church members and others he promised risk-free cryptocurrency investments. The report has it that Pinillo assured investors of 40% returns. However, rather than invest the funds, he has been alleged to have diverted them into his and co-conspirator accounts. The 51-year-old was finally arrested in Miami on December 5, 2024, on one count of unlicensed money-transmitting business and 25 counts of wire fraud. Allegations of Crypto Scam and Fraudulent Investment Promises Pinillo was arraigned at the Richland US Courthouse in the Federal Building, where he pleaded innocent to the charges. However, if found guilty, the accused could bag up to 20 years in jail for the alleged crimes. The accused pastor also has other charges to respond to besides the current case. The Commodity Trading Commission has also filed a civil lawsuit against Pinillo. The CTC is by law saddled with the responsibility of regulating and enforcing commodity exchanges. As per the filing in the civil lawsuit, Pinillo scammed unsuspecting members of different churches he reached out to using the guise of honesty. Pinillo, besides preaching at his church in Pasco, Washington, also attended other churches as a guest speaker. The Scamming Method During his sermons, Pinillo preached to church members to lift themselves out of poverty and introduced his “investment offers.” Aside from church meetings, Pinillo also solicited investments at public gatherings held at the Conference Center or the Pasco Red Lion Hotel. Additionally, Pinillo operates from Telegram and Facebook and has about 1,500 users. Other crypto scammers have been known to target YouTube comments . Interestingly, when those who invested made withdrawal requests, the accused pastor lied about website downtime. Others were told that the platform system had issues and needed fixing; he asked to send funds for the repairs from these sets. Authorities’ Response and Challenges Vanessa Waldref, the United States Attorney for the Eastern Washington District, has condemned the crypto scam and decried the rise in crypto investment scams. Although she acknowledged that fraudulent investment schemes were not new, Waldref noted that cryptocurrency scams have become a means of ripping money from hardworking, honest people. These scams could also target job seekers with promises of remote jobs, as reported by TheCoinrise .

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Cardano eyes $8 recovery, but Rexas Finance, under $0.20, is tipped to hit $8 first with rapid presale growth. Table of Contents Cardano’s correction: The end in sight? Rexas Finance: A rival under $0.20 Cardano vs. Rexas Finance: Who win the race to $8? Conclusion Following a significant fall, Cardano (ADA) shows indications of recovery; analysts see a rise towards $8. Nevertheless, Rexas Finance (RXS), priced under $0.20, is causing stirs on the crypto scene. Experts are now tipping RXS to hit $8 before Cardano based on its creative approach to asset tokenization and accelerated presale growth, which will attract savvy investors. Cardano’s correction: The end in sight? Rising from a difficult period of correction, Cardano has taken the stage. The coin is now showing indications of stabilization following a 40% drop from its November highs, suggesting a possible positive comeback. Emphasizing its part in ADA’s long-term growth path, noted analyst Michaël van de Poppe has called this phase a “healthy correction.” He calls the $0.74–$0.98 region a crucial support zone that offers investors opportunities to build the token at discounted rates. Van de Poppe says breaking past the $1.24 resistance level would indicate significant positive momentum, possibly paving the way for a price rise toward $8. Also of interest is ADA’s movement to discuss a substantial imbalance zone on the four-hour chart. This area is significant for short-term traders since such zones often create substantial price swings. Should ADA have a strong comeback here, it would cross the $1 psychological barrier. In the long term, ADA is still a major contender for notable increases; good market circumstances could take it over the eagerly awaited $8 milestone. Rexas Finance: A rival under $0.20 With creative features appealing to investors seeking exponential development, Rexas Finance has positioned itself as a major competitor in the race to $8. At only $0.175 during its continuous stage 11 presale, RXS presents a unique opportunity for early buyers. With an impressive $35.82 million raised already, the coin shows strong investor confidence and enthusiasm for its possibilities. Top market analysts are increasingly pointing out that Rexas Finance is a better investment prospect than Cardano. One factor is RXS’s spectacular presale expansion; early attendees experienced gains of about 500%. This performance emphasizes the token’s increasing momentum and appeal to both short-term and long-term investors. Moreover, Rexas Finance’s $1 million gift campaign has attracted over 760,000 people, increasing the token’s demand. Investors can increase their chances of winning a piece of the $50,000 prize pool by following basic requirements, such as owning at least $100 worth of RXS, completing chores, and introducing others. Thanks to its smaller market cap and creative use case, analysts also point out that RXS is better suited to hitting the $8 benchmark before Cardano. Unlike Cardano, which must contend with network delays and intense competition, Rexas Finance is riding a wave of momentum that might carry it to even higher levels. Its potential for quick expansion is shown by its capacity to draw considerable money and investor interest during its presale period. Cardano vs. Rexas Finance: Who win the race to $8? The struggle between Cardano and Rexas Finance highlights the Bitcoin market’s dynamic and often shifting character. Cardano is a powerful player with a solid reputation and excellent community support; nevertheless, as it overcomes its present difficulties, its road to $8 might take time. Conversely, Rexas Finance’s aggressive expansion plan and creative asset tokenization method help it be a powerful competitor aiming initially at $8. Though Rexas Finance’s presale success and market chatter point to it may provide faster profits, both coins have unique value propositions. RXS is fast becoming a must-have token in the crypto market thanks to its emphasis on transforming asset management and capacity to draw general investor attention. Conclusion Cardano and Rexas Finance represent two diverse routes to crypto success, each appealing to a different investor profile. ADA is a secure investment for long-term stability and consistent growth, while RXS is suitable for investors looking for quick returns and exposure to innovative technologies. For those willing to explore new opportunities, Rexas Finance offers a chance to be part of a game-changing project that could redefine asset ownership. As the race to $8 heats up, it remains to be seen which token will emerge victorious — but one thing is clear: the future of crypto investments has never been more exciting.

It’s been an unstoppable force, fueled by AI mania and promises of tax cuts from President Donald Trump. But Wall Street is suddenly sweating as Treasury yields surge past 5%. Friday’s 1.5% plunge in the S&P 500 was a brutal wake-up call. The index erased all its 2025 gains and nearly wiped out the November rally that followed Trump’s election win. Wall Street is now staring at an uncomfortable truth: the bond market has declared war on them. Treasury yields hit 5% and spook the stock market Higher yields mean better returns for investors in bonds, so why bother risking money in stocks? Right now, the S&P 500’s earnings yield is sitting 1% below what you’d get from a 10-year Treasury note. That’s a 2002-level problem, and it’s making equities look like a lousy deal. The trouble doesn’t stop there. Rising yields hit companies where it hurts. Borrowing costs go up, squeezing profits and making capital-intensive projects less appealing. Investors have started noticing, and the pain is showing up on their screens. The Fed’s role in this chaos isn’t exactly comforting. They’ve cut the fed funds rate by 100 basis points since September, but yields have shot up by the same margin during that time. This divergence is global, with inflation staying stubborn, central banks doubling down on hawkish policies, and government debt ballooning across the board. For traders hoping the Fed would save the day, think again. If the S&P 500 has a safety net, it’s Big Tech. The so-called Magnificent Seven—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla—are still raking in cash and posting solid earnings. Together, these giants make up more than 30% of the index, giving them outsized influence over market performance. AI is the golden goose here. Investors are banking on these companies to dominate the AI revolution, which explains why their stocks are still doing well despite the broader market jitters. But even tech isn’t invincible. Gold breaks the rules 2024 was a bizarre year. Gold and the S&P 500, which are usually enemies on the trading floor, suddenly became best friends. The correlation between them hit 0.91—a record. Historically, these assets move in opposite directions. Stocks scream risk, while gold whispers safety. But not this time. Gold surged 30% last year, its best run since 2010, while the S&P 500 added trillions to its value. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 7%, and the 10-year Treasury yield climbed 22%. That all three moved up together is almost unheard of. Central banks added 794 tonnes of gold in 2024, their third-largest buying spree this century. China led the charge, snapping up gold as deflation fears loomed. Meanwhile, Bitcoin and gold—two assets that usually compete as “safe havens”—broke their inverse relationship, outperforming the S&P 500 together. Bitcoin and gold ETFs now hold $130 billion in assets combined. Investors are piling in, seeing these assets as shields against inflation, geopolitical chaos, and market instability. The Federal Reserve’s playbook is changing. After a year of aggressive rate hikes in 2022, the Fed has slowed down. Rate cuts are happening, but not at the pace Wall Street wants. Inflation is sticking around, with money supply growth hitting a 20-month high. This makes the January Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) reports critical. These numbers will shape the Fed’s outlook for 2025 and determine whether more cuts are on the table.

Holders of these assets are now eyeing alternative investment opportunities in what could be a historic year for the crypto space. One project gaining a lot of attention is Remittix (RTX), an advanced PayFi solution designed to capitalise on the cross-border payments space. So why are DeFi enthusiasts diverting funds to this new project? Stellar (XLM) Sees Dips Despite Integrating Smart Contracts Stellar had a relatively strong 2024 and its net gain over the last 12 months still sits at 236% even after recent losses. Stellar (XLM) has seen a 5.4% decrease in the last month and a further 13.9% drop in the last week. These negative price movements come despite strong technological progress on Stellar’s part in recent quarters. Stellar (XLM) developers have been busy fine tuning Stellar’s smart contracts, which landed on the blockchain earlier in 2024 with the release of the Protocol 20 update. This saw the incorporation of the Soroban smart contracts platform. Several tweaks later, and this update has significantly improved Stellar’s appeal to developers looking to construct decentralized applications. Dogecoin Is Down 19.4% In The Last Month Dogecoin (DOGE) maintained a strong trajectory through much of 2024 though the beginning of the New Year has seen its price dip significantly. In the last month, Dogecoin dropped 19.4% and experienced a further 14% decrease in the last week. Analyst commentary is split on whether these discernable price dips are due to Dogecoin’s individual problems, or whether they simply represent a general downturn in the meme coin space. Dogecoin (DOGE) now encounters a pivotal moment in its lifespan, as holders wonder which way it will go. Dogecoin still has a net 297% price gain over the last year. This partly owes to Dogecoin’s (DOGE) major spike following an implied endorsement from Trump when he named a new government department after the cryptocurrency. Solana Sees 17.8% Decrease Despite Scalability Updates Solana (SOL) tried valiantly throughout 2024 to ramp up its network scalability to new heights. The introduction of an alternative validator client, Firedancer, boosted Solana’s transaction-handling capabilities while improving access to Solana among the developer community. Solana (SOL) continues to attract DeFi and NFT projects thanks to its focus on developer-friendly architecture, and Solana’s own figures convey that over 7,000 new developers joined the network in 2024. Still, even with those technological advances, Solana (SOL) has been on an ugly downward trend, dropping 17.8% in a month and 14% in a week. Remittix Poised To Disrupt The Cross-Border Payments Space While established projects like Stellar, Dogecoin, and Solana are making strides in innovation, savvy investors are also looking at emerging platforms with the potential for exponential growth. One such project is Remittix (RTX), a groundbreaking PayFi platform that is poised to disrupt the lucrative cross-border payments space. Remittix (RTX) combines the best features of blockchain and traditional banking to offer seamless crypto-to-fiat transactions. Users can convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies and send funds to any global bank account with ease. Unlike traditional systems that often impose hidden fees, Remittix operates with a transparent flat-rate pricing model, ensuring recipients receive exactly what was sent. Remittix (RTX) also stands out for its privacy-focused design, ensuring that recipients receive funds as standard bank transfers without any indication that the transaction originated in cryptocurrency. This innovative approach eliminates concerns around crypto adoption barriers while maintaining the simplicity and familiarity of traditional banking systems. For users and businesses alike, this feature offers unparalleled flexibility and autonomy, making Remittix a seamless bridge between the blockchain and conventional finance worlds. Remittix Shows Dominance In Presale Central to the ecosystem is the $RTX token which is currently in presale at an alluring price of just $0.0199 for early adopters. This presale is drawing unprecedented interest from across the board having recently surpassed the $2.4 million mark. Analysts expect an 580% uptick by the end of the presale and a possible 5,000% rally post-launch.

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 16:55:47
38848589,https://finbold.com/?p=227985,1736701112,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Legendary trader sets Bitcoin next high target after possible dump,https://finbold.com/legendary-trader-sets-bitcoin-next-high-target-after-possible-dump/,"After Bitcoin ( BTC ) attained a record high of above $100,000, one of the dominating opinions in the market is the asset’s potential to make further gains. However, some players foresee a possible plunge before attempting another all-time high. In this line, legendary trading expert Peter Brandt has raised the possibility of Bitcoin experiencing one final “dump” or an extended period of consolidation before its next significant move upward. In an X post on January 12, the expert backed his analysis with data showcasing Bitcoin’s recent price history identifying phases he labeled as “pump,” “hump,” and “dump.” Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Peter Brandt Notably, a “pump” is a period of rapid upward momentum, like Bitcoin’s rise from $70,000 to above $100,000 in late 2024, driven by strong buying and bullish sentiment amid the general post-election optimism. A “hump” follows as the rally slows and encounters resistance, as seen in Bitcoin’s December plateau that has culminated in the current consolidation around the $95,000 spot. Lastly, a “dump” represents a downward correction due to a possible profit-taking or fading momentum, with Brandt suggesting another possible dip to $73,018 if key support fails. Brandt observed the price action, noting that markets often do not falter until retail traders grow fatigued, a common precursor to major price movements in cryptocurrency . “The big question in my mind is whether Bitcoin will get one more dump (or more lengthy congestive chop) before the pump. Remember, markets generally do not sour until retail traders get worn out,” he said. Bitcoin’s critical juncture Another prominent cryptocurrency analyst, Ali Martinez, shared a similar outlook. In an X post on January 11, Martinez projected that Bitcoin could surge to as high as $140,000 or face a pullback to $67,000. These projections are based on two key patterns observed on the 12-hour BTC chart: a bull pennant and a head-and-shoulders formation. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The bull pennant, characterized by an initial price rally followed by consolidation with converging trendlines, signals a bullish continuation. On the other hand, the head-and-shoulders pattern, featuring a central peak (head) flanked by two lower highs (shoulders), points to a possible bearish reversal. As Bitcoin consolidates around the $95,000 mark, it can be argued that the cryptocurrency is at a critical juncture in determining its next price trajectory. What next for Bitcoin’s price Looking ahead, varied outlooks for Bitcoin persist. Some analysts anticipate the asset doubling in 2025, driven by optimism stemming from the election of Donald Trump , who plans to make the United States a cryptocurrency investment hub. For instance, banking giant Standard Chartered predicts Bitcoin will hit $200,000, mainly driven by institutional investors. Additionally, as reported by Finbold, analyst Gert van Lagen predicted that Bitcoin could reach an ambitious target of $300,000 by March 30, 2025, based on the Elliott Wave Theory, which identifies repetitive market cycles. Meanwhile, as Bitcoin hovers below the $100,000 mark, some analysts, such as Alan Santana, have expressed concerns that continued trading below this level might open the asset to a drop as steep as $40,000. Overall, suppose Trump supports the crypto space, as highlighted during his campaign, Bitcoin will likely see further surges, driven by the excitement surrounding a possible clear regulatory framework that could attract institutional investors. There is also a continued push to have mega-companies convert their cash reserves into Bitcoin to hedge against inflation. For example, with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) shareholders rejecting this idea, attention has turned to social media giant Meta (NASDAQ: META ). Specifically, a shareholder has proposed that Facebook’s parent company convert part of its $72 billion cash reserve into Bitcoin. If approved, this move could position Meta as one of the leading traditional companies to hold Bitcoin, potentially catalyzing price growth. Bitcoin price analysis At the time of reporting, Bitcoin showed continued consolidation around the $94,000 mark, with a valuation of $94,900. Over the past 24 hours, the asset has made modest gains of almost 0.5%, while on a weekly timeframe, BTC is down about 1.5%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

Despite its strong fundamentals and ongoing network developments, ADA has struggled to maintain its upward momentum, raising concerns among investors. This downturn comes amid broader market fluctuations and shifting investor interest toward emerging blockchain projects with higher growth potential. As the Cardano price wavers, traders and savvy investors flock to PropiChain (PCHAIN), an AI altcoin with a potential 12,000X rally in Q1 2025. PropiChain is a revolutionary blockchain-based real estate investment platform that has captured investor attention with its ambitious roadmap. Analysts predict a staggering 12,000x surge for PCHAIN, positioning it as a potential game-changer and alternative to investors seeking to avoid the crashing Cardano price. With its unique value proposition and growing adoption, PCHAIN is emerging as a strong contender in the market. It is drawing liquidity away from established crypto assets like the Cardano price, which is battling downward pressure. As the hype builds, investors are confident that PCHAIN will deliver on its promise of 12,000X growth. The Cardano Price Decline Amid Rising Interest in PCHAIN As of January 9, 2025, the Cardano price has dropped to $0.91, reflecting a bearish trend that has persisted over recent months. This decline is notable considering ADA’s previous highs and its position as a leading crypto asset by market capitalization. The Cardano price has lost 6% in the past week and over 10% in the past month. This Cardano price downturn can be attributed to factors such as increased market volatility and a general decline in investor interest. Additionally, large transactions exceeding $100,000 have dropped to a six-week low, suggesting diminished activity from significant investors on the blockchain network. In contrast to the Cardano price recent struggles, PCHAIN has been gaining traction in the crypto market. Analysts have highlighted the token as a promising alternative for investors seeking safer returns, with some predicting a potential surge of up to 12,000 times its initial value. PropiChain’s innovative approach integrates blockchain technology with the real estate market, enabling fractional ownership of properties. This model allows investors to access high-value real estate assets without the substantial capital typically required. It democratizes real estate investment opportunities. Additionally, PCHAIN is backed by the $600 trillion global real estate market, giving the asset a layer of stability that shields investors from the volatility currently affecting the Cardano price movement. The PropiChain Path to 12,000X Returns for Early Presale Investors While the Cardano price continues to struggle, PropiChain is on its path to a historic 12,000X return for early presale investors. According to leading market analysts, 2 major factors influenced their belief in PCHAIN reaching massive heights in Q1 2025. Technological Innovation PCHAIN utilizes cutting-edge technologies like AI, the Metaverse, etc., to power the future of global real estate. The platform deploys these technological features to redefine real estate property management and transactions. According to the project road, PCHAIN aims to capture at least 1% of the $600 trillion global real estate market. 1% of the entire real estate market means the platform becomes a $6 trillion ecosystem, potentially driving up the token’s value beyond the projected 12,000X. Growing Demand in the $16 trillion RWA Tokenization Market The global real-world asset (RWA) tokenization market is projected to grow to $16 trillion, with real estate the largest contributor. The PropiChain token bridges the gap between real estate properties and the blockchain, making PCHAIN a highly sought-after token. The growing demand for PCHAIN in the $16 trillion RWA tokenization market will certainly skyrocket the token’s value. PropiChain: Powering the Future of Global Real Estate PropiChain is transforming the real estate investment landscape by seamlessly integrating artificial intelligence, smart contracts, the Metaverse, and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization technology. AI-Driven Insights for Smarter Investment Decisions PCHAIN employs AI to empower investors with advanced decision-making tools. AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots provide real-time guidance, helping users navigate the complexities of real estate investment. Beyond customer support, the platform incorporates predictive analytics to assess market conditions, evaluate risk factors, and generate data-backed investment strategies. These AI-driven insights ensure that investors make informed decisions based on data rather than speculation, thereby maximizing profitability. Metaverse-Powered Virtual Property Exploration The platform is revolutionizing how investors interact with real estate by incorporating Metaverse technology. Instead of relying on traditional property visits, users can explore high-value assets through immersive 3D virtual tours. This feature allows buyers and sellers to engage remotely, eliminating geographical barriers and reducing costs associated with in-person property inspections. Smart Contracts for Automated and Efficient Transactions PCHAIN utilizes blockchain-powered smart contracts to automate property leases and lease renewals. These self-executing contracts remove the need for intermediaries, such as brokers and agents, reducing transaction fees and paperwork. RWA Tokenization: Unlocking High-Value Real Estate for All By tokenizing real-world real estate assets, PropiChain democratizes access to high-value properties. Investors can purchase fractional shares of premium real estate, enabling broader participation in lucrative investment opportunities that were once reserved for high-net-worth individuals. With its innovative integration of AI, smart contracts, the Metaverse, and RWA tokenization, PropiChain is pioneering a new era of real estate investment, bringing unparalleled accessibility, efficiency, and profitability to investors. Conclusion The Cardano price fall below $1.50 reflects current market challenges, while the rise of PropiChain highlights the ongoing innovation within the crypto space. PCHAIN raised over $1.3 million in its first presale round and already crossed the $800,000 mark in the ongoing second presale round, signaling investors’ confidence in the project. With its projected 12,000X surge, top analysts strongly believe that your $1000 investment in the ongoing presale would yield over $232,490 by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Join the presale now to enjoy massive gains. The token price will rise to $0.023 from the current $0.011 for the next presale round. PCHAIN was audited by BlockAudit , a top blockchain security company, and they found no vulnerability in the project’s smart contract. Additionally, the token is listed on CoinMarketCap , indicating the project’s readiness to do great things in the crypto space.

Right now, the whole market is in a downturn, but experts say that this is normal at these times. With that in mind, a Dogecoin millionaire has listed his top AI altcoins picks for Q2 of 2025. These include RCO Finance (RCOF), Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET), and Near Protocol (NEAR)! However, out of these 3 AI altcoins, RCO Finance seems to be the most promising! That’s because this new SolidProof audited platform brings never-before-seen utility and features that will revolutionize the trading industry! Artificial Superintelligence Alliance Is Conducting Its First FET Token Burn Artificial Superintelligence Alliance will be undergoing its first-ever token burn on January 10, 2025. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is one of the most popular AI altcoins right now, merging a few months ago to create a stronger token. As such, Artificial Superintelligence Alliance has already attracted a lot of new attention. A prominent Dogecoin millionaire believes that the FET token burn will bring even more interest to Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, which is why he sees FET as one of the best AI altcoins right now. The FET token burn will see 5 million FET tokens burns, creating deflationary pressure in the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance ecosystem. This means that it will decrease the supply of FET tokens on the market, which is set to boost FET’s price. Right now, FET is trading around $1.30, a 7.54% decrease from the FET price a week ago. With the token burn incoming, the Dogecoin millionaire says that now is a great time to buy FET on the dip. He sees FET rising at least 100% after the burn, and even more throughout the year. So, Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is definitely one of the best AI altcoins you need to look out for right now! Dogecoin Millionaire Sees Near Protocol as a Sleeping Giant Near Protocol is another one of the Dogecoin millionaire’s best AI altcoins. NEAR is also a bit smaller in market cap compared to Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, which means that it has a slightly larger room for growth. Also, 90% of the Near Protocol community is currently bullish on NEAR, which is a great sign for its future. Furthermore, the Near Protocol community is bullish even during NEAR’s current price dip. Namely, NEAR’s price is at $4.96 right now, down by 9.67% in 7 days. This dip is mainly caused by a wider market downturn, which is why Near Protocol holders aren’t worried. Instead, they’re loading up on NEAR tokens as we speak, which will inevitably boost NEAR’s price soon. Also, as the AI altcoins run heats up, NEAR is set to skyrocket, bringing at least 2x gains by Q2 of 2025! However, Near Protocol can’t beat the gains that RCO Finance will bring. That’s why many Near Protocol holders are also investing in RCOF, expecting life-changing gains by Q2! RCO Finance Is Taking AI Altcoins To Incredible Levels The Dogecoin millionaire sees RCO Finance as the most promising out of all AI altcoins. That’s because RCO Finance is a brand-new project, one that will launch as the AI altcoins run heats up. Also, RCO Finance is bringing utility like we’ve never seen before, set to completely change how we trade forever! How? Well, it’s all possible with RCO Finance’s AI Robo Advisor. The AI Robo Advisor is a trading tool like no other, trumping everything else we’ve seen so far. It uses advanced AI and ML algorithms to help people trade/invest and be successful even without prior experience! To do that, the AI Robo Advisor has the ability to craft sophisticated investment strategies for every single RCO Finance user. First, it asks the user about their risk tolerance, market preference, and financial goals. Then, it combines this with relevant TA and market data. So, in the end, RCO Finance users get tailored and data-driven investment strategies. Also, RCO Finance gives people access to more than 120,000 assets, allowing them to diversify their portfolios and decrease their risk. Furthermore, the AI Robo Advisor will update the strategies at all times, making sure RCO Finance users are always trading in line with the markets. To do this, it digests real-time financial data from sources like Bloomberg and Reuters. It then injects the data into the trades in seconds! This allows all RCO Finance users to catch every new market movement, change, and trend. It also enables them to make money in all market conditions, even in times of increased volatility! So, with all of these amazing features on its roster, it’s no wonder that the Dogecoin millionaire sees RCOF as one of the best AI altcoins right now! Don’t Miss Out: Join the RCOF Public Presale Before It’s Too Late! Many investors, including the Dogecoin millionaire, are scrambling to join RCOF’s public presale as we speak. That’s because the presale allows you to invest in one of the market’s most promising AI altcoins very early! As such, it gives you the chance to catch RCOF’s entire post-launch rally. Right now, RCOF is selling for $0.0777 in Stage 4 of its presale. The presale will continue until RCOF reaches $0.4-$0.6, and RCOF’s price will rise with every new stage. After the launch, RCOF is set to start its massive rally, fueled by the 2025 AI altcoins run and its own amazing utility. With that in mind, the Dogecoin millionaire sees RCOF’s price rising by 1,000x by Q2 of 2025, bringing life-changing gains to early adopters!

As their gains falter, a new AI contender, PropiChain , is capturing investor attention with its revolutionary approach to blockchain and real estate investments. Offering a massive 43,000% upside, PropiChain presents an unparalleled opportunity for those looking to ride the next big wave in crypto. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are Struggling to Sustain Their Momentum Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, two of the most popular meme coins, have seen their fair share of ups and downs in the volatile crypto market. Recently, Dogecoin has faced challenges maintaining its momentum, failing to break above the critical $0.40 resistance. Analysts note that short-term profit booking and bearish market sentiment have contributed to DOGE’s struggles. Without significant buying pressure, a break below $0.30 could see DOGE plunge to $0.23. Shiba Inu is no stranger to similar challenges, as its price often correlates closely with Dogecoin. The lack of clear bullish signals and a flat RSI indicates a stagnating market for these meme coins. While they once captured headlines with massive gains, their current struggles highlight the limitations of meme coins with limited real-world utility. This market dynamic is driving investors to look beyond meme coins, seeking projects with tangible use cases and long-term growth potential. PropiChain , an emerging AI-powered altcoin, is capturing attention as a promising alternative, offering real-world value in sectors like real estate and investment analytics. PropiChain is Redefining Property Investment with AI Unlike Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, which rely heavily on community hype, PropiChain offers practical, innovative solutions that address real-world challenges. One standout feature is the real estate tokenization, which transforms physical properties into digital tokens. This allows investors to purchase fractions of properties, significantly lowering the entry barrier to real estate investment. For example, instead of needing $200,000 to invest in a property, PropiChain enables investors to buy shares for as little as $1,000. This democratization opens doors to countless individuals who previously couldn’t access the market. PropiChain also uses AI-powered insights to guide investment decisions. Its predictive analytics tool evaluates market trends and property values, helping investors maximize their returns. PCHAIN holders using this AI can identify undervalued properties or predict rental income which can dramatically inform their decision to invest or not. The integration of blockchain ensures transparency and security. Smart contracts automate processes like leasing, rental payments, and title transfers, eliminating traditional inefficiencies and fraud risks. For instance, PropiChain’s blockchain infrastructure prevents scams like title duplication, giving investors peace of mind. Another groundbreaking feature is the metaverse integration, where users can explore tokenized properties virtually before investing. This immersive experience combines convenience and informed decision-making. PropiChain’s unique blend of blockchain, AI, and real estate innovation positions it far ahead of meme coins like Dogecoin, which lack these transformative applications. This is why PropiChain is quickly becoming the go-to choice for forward-thinking investors. PropiChain’s Presale is a Game-Changing Opportunity for Early Adopters PropiChain’s presale is generating significant excitement. Priced at just $0.011 during its second stage, the presale offers early investors a chance to secure a stake in a project with immense growth potential. The platform has already raised nearly $3 million so far, showcasing strong investor confidence. As the presale progresses, prices are set to increase to $0.023 the next stage, making this the ideal time for entry. Investors who seize this opportunity could see an easy 100% increase even before its listing. So if the project achieves its 43,000% upside, an early investment of $1,000 now will be $430,000 as the project matures and attracts more attention. Conclusion As Dogecoin and Shiba Inu struggle to maintain their momentum, PropiChain stands out as a forward-thinking altcoin with practical applications and immense growth potential.. Unlike meme coins, which often rely on speculative trading, PropiChain delivers tangible value through features like real estate tokenization, AI-driven analytics, and secure blockchain transactions. These innovations not only set it apart but also position it as a leader in the next generation of cryptocurrency. For investors looking to capitalize on a high-growth opportunity, PropiChain’s presale is a golden chance to get in early. With prices set to rise in later stages, now is the time to act and secure a stake in this promising project.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/about-1-billion-xrp-two-days-heres-the-significance/,"Renowned crypto analyst Ali (@ali_charts) recently highlighted a significant development in the XRP market. In a tweet accompanied by data from Santiment, a leading blockchain analytics platform, Ali reported that whales accumulated approximately 1 billion XRP within 48 hours. This substantial purchase underscores a surge in interest among large-scale investors, typically considered a bullish signal for any asset class. The chart shared by Ali provides a detailed view of this accumulation, showing a spike in XRP whale holdings. This activity involved wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion XRP, a range often associated with institutional or high-net-worth individual investors. Whales bought roughly 1 billion $XRP in the last 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/XUlibpXkz5 — Ali (@ali_charts) January 10, 2025 Despite the substantial accumulation, XRP’s price has remained relatively unchanged, currently trading at $2.35, reflecting a 3.82% decrease over the past week. Market Reactions and Community Sentiment Ali’s tweet sparked varied reactions from the crypto community. An X user, Four, commented , “That’s a massive move! Looks like the whales are feeling bullish. Exciting times ahead for XRP holders!” Another user, Anier, added , “They know what’s coming,” implying that whale investors might anticipate significant developments for XRP soon. However, not all responses were optimistic. ISOCRYPTOGUY questioned the lack of immediate price impact, stating, “And the price did nothing really.” This sentiment reflects a broader observation within the crypto market, where increased whale accumulation does not always translate into immediate price movements.

While whale accumulation is often interpreted as a precursor to potential price increases, the broader market sentiment and macroeconomic factors remain critical in determining the asset’s trajectory. The significant accumulation also coincides with ongoing discussions about XRP’s role in the financial sector, particularly its potential utility in cross-border payments and integration with ISO 20022 standards . The timing of such whale activity might hint at strategic positioning ahead of anticipated announcements or broader adoption.

In 2024, while crypto markets doubled, DePIN outpaced this growth, which can be attributed to artificial intelligence (AI) achieving global prominence. New data reveals that this nascent sector currently holds less than 0.1% of their $1 trillion+ addressable market. DePIN Is The “Frontier” As decentralized networks outcompete centralized corporations with faster and more reliable offerings, DePIN is projected to grow 100-1000x over the next decade, according to Messari’s latest report . Interestingly, the “chain wars” have intensified, with Solana and Base gaining market share. Interoperability solutions like Wormhole and LayerZero have driven DePINs to adopt multi-chain strategies, broadening their user base but fragmenting liquidity. Messari stated that Solana’s “latency-focused” culture appears to have amassed innovators at the infra layer, while Coinbase’s brand and retail distribution have attracted consumer-focused founders to Base. Early-stage VCs were found to be aggressively invested in DePIN, buoyed by strong listing conditions. In private markets, funding at the pre-seed and seed levels surpassed Series A rounds. Meanwhile, in liquid markets, projects with lower listing FDVs demonstrated the highest returns. Of the leading 22 DePIN tokens, only four depreciated after their TGE, with Virtuals Protocol leading the pack with over 30,000% growth. NEURAL and NodeAI also showed remarkable performance as each grew more than 2,000%. Late-stage capital was directed toward a select few standout projects and was supported by top-tier VCs. These projects launched tokens at 50-100x book value, frequently achieving multi-billion-dollar FDVs. Community efforts also proved crucial as $230 million was raised in 2024 via node sales, crowdfunding, and protocol-owned liquidity pools. Additionally, DePIN is becoming a tool for local governments to solve infrastructure problems. In fact, the report stated that leaders are using it to address key concerns, such as promoting AI sovereignty in Tanzania and bridging the digital divide in Mexico, to resonate with voters and secure electoral victories. DePIN Poised for Growth in 2025? Crypto hedge fund and venture capital firm Pantera Capital recently predicted that 2025 would be a crucial year for DePIN, with regulatory clarity potentially eliminating key barriers for investors and innovators. Grayscale Research also echoed a similar sentiment and stated that DePIN has emerged as a key focus within its Top 20 crypto investment list.

Mudrex believes it will have completed its compliance upgrade by January 28th and consequently resume crypto withdrawals. Mudrex believes its compliance upgrade will prevent bad actors In an X post on January 12, Alankar Saxena, Founder and Chief Trading Officer at Mudrex, announced that the firm would temporarily cease withdrawing digital assets. Saxena claimed that the company was still working on its compliance upgrade, and the withdrawal halt was implemented as part of the broader effort. The platform, however, still allows for INR withdrawals. Mudrex said the withdrawal suspension would only last until the compliance suite is fully upgraded, potentially till January 28. The company insists that the compliance upgrade will be necessary to “avoid bad actors.” Saxena even emphasized that the company’s priority is serving its investors, ensuring they have unrestricted access to their funds at all times. He defended Mudrex’s decision, saying the company has maintained its services in the last few years; it never halted its deposits or withdrawals, even when other Indian companies did. He claimed the firm believes in crypto’s core principles and is still committed to advancing the crypto movement. Additionally, Edul Patel, co-founder and CEO of Mudrex, commented “ You need to do that with something as critical as crypto. If the infrastructure is not correct, it is very easy for it to be misused for nefarious activities. As a responsible platform, we need to make sure that our systems are in place and we are improving the services at all points in time .” The crypto community believe there’s more to Mudrex’s withdrawal suspension Some crypto community members have been skeptical of Mudrex’s move and have even asked users to be cautious and pull out from the platform immediately. Vivian Live on X warned users on the platform, asking all those with remaining funds to convert them into INR and deposit the funds in their bank accounts. Aakash Athawasya even claimed that Mudrex had never offered crypto withdrawals in the first place, arguing the company had only provided price exposure and not ownership. He even jokingly commented that he would not touch Mudrex with a ten-foot pole, and neither should anyone. Aakash believes that the exchange may not have crypto holdings urging community members not to use Mudrex. Still, Mudrex has over 3 million users, and in December, the exchange’s trading volume rose to $200 million. The company aims to onboard 10 million users by the end of 2025, by entering new markets and catering to a wider range of audience.

Among the hottest contenders in the market today are Qubetics ($TICS), Ondo, and ZIGnaly (ZIG). These projects aren’t just following trends—they’re setting them. Qubetics is breaking barriers with its innovative Decentralized VPN feature, offering robust privacy solutions. Ondo is rewriting the playbook on DeFi liquidity, while ZIGnaly is bringing the power of copy trading to crypto enthusiasts everywhere. In this article, we’ll explore how these three altcoins are making waves in blockchain technology and why they rank among the best altcoins to invest in today. Qubetics ($TICS): A Game-Changer in Decentralized Privacy When it comes to blockchain innovation, Qubetics is a name you can’t ignore. With its advanced Decentralized VPN (dVPN) technology, Qubetics is tackling one of the most pressing concerns of the digital age: privacy. Traditional VPNs, while popular, often come with their own set of problems. Centralized servers make them vulnerable to attacks, and there’s always the lingering doubt—can you really trust the provider with your data? Qubetics’ dVPN eliminates these issues by decentralizing the entire process, ensuring that no single entity controls the network. Imagine you’re a journalist working in a high-risk environment or a remote worker relying on secure connections to handle sensitive client data. With Qubetics’ dVPN, your online activity is encrypted and distributed across a global network of nodes, making it virtually impossible for hackers—or anyone else—to intercept your data. But Qubetics doesn’t stop at privacy. Its partnership with SWFT Blockchain adds seamless cross-chain compatibility, allowing users to transact securely across multiple blockchain networks. Currently in its 16th presale stage, Qubetics has already captured significant attention, over 413 million tokens sold to more than 14,200 holders. A whopping $9.3 million raised so far. At just $0.0455 per $TICS token, investors are getting a golden opportunity to back a project with real-world utility and a strong future. Ondo: Revolutionizing DeFi Liquidity Next up is Ondo, a project that’s shaking up the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. If you’ve dabbled in DeFi, you know that liquidity is king. Ondo is pioneering new ways to manage and optimize liquidity, making it a standout in the crowded crypto space. One of Ondo’s flagship features is its vault strategies, which offer investors an easy way to access yield opportunities without the complexity typically associated with DeFi. Whether you’re a first-time crypto investor or a seasoned DeFi enthusiast, Ondo’s user-friendly interface and transparent operations make it an attractive option. Imagine you’re holding stablecoins and want to earn passive income without risking your capital in volatile markets. Ondo provides a solution by offering risk-hedged strategies that maximize yield while minimizing exposure to market fluctuations. It’s like having your cake and eating it too. Ondo also stands out for its focus on institutional adoption. By bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain, Ondo is paving the way for broader acceptance of DeFi solutions. This dual appeal to retail and institutional investors makes it one of the best altcoins to invest in today. ZIGnaly (ZIG): Redefining Copy Trading in Crypto Last but not least is ZIGnaly, a platform that’s making crypto trading accessible to everyone. Trading cryptocurrencies can be intimidating, especially for newcomers. ZIGnaly’s innovative copy trading model solves this problem by allowing users to mirror the strategies of seasoned traders. Let’s say you’re new to crypto and don’t have the time—or the expertise—to analyze market trends. With ZIGnaly, you can simply choose a professional trader whose strategy aligns with your goals and let the platform handle the rest. It’s like having a personal crypto guru at your fingertips. But ZIGnaly isn’t just about copy trading. The platform also offers profit-sharing models, enabling users to earn even when they aren’t actively trading. It’s this combination of ease-of-use and innovative features that sets ZIGnaly apart from the competition. As crypto adoption grows, platforms like ZIGnaly are becoming increasingly popular, making it one of the best altcoins to invest in today. The Power of Decentralized VPNs: A Deep Dive Before wrapping up, it’s worth taking a closer look at why Decentralized VPNs (dVPNs) are so important in the blockchain ecosystem. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on centralized servers, dVPNs use a peer-to-peer network to encrypt and route your internet traffic. This approach offers unparalleled privacy. For instance, if you’re working on sensitive projects or simply value your online anonymity, a dVPN ensures your data is safe from prying eyes. Moreover, by decentralizing the infrastructure, dVPNs are far more resistant to censorship and server outages. Qubetics ’ dVPN stands out in this space for its seamless integration with blockchain technology, offering both security and transparency. It’s the kind of innovation that shows how blockchain can solve real-world problems, making Qubetics a leader in this emerging field. Conclusion: Why These Altcoins Are Worth Your Attention The crypto world is brimming with possibilities, but not all projects are created equal. Qubetics ($TICS), Ondo, and ZIGnaly (ZIG) each bring something unique to the table, making them the best altcoins to invest in today. Whether it’s Qubetics’ cutting-edge dVPN, Ondo’s revolutionary DeFi solutions, or ZIGnaly’s user-friendly copy trading platform, these projects are shaping the future of blockchain technology. If you’re looking to diversify your portfolio and back projects with real-world utility, now’s the time to explore these altcoins. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the next wave of blockchain innovation.

Among these, PEPETO, Dogecoin (DOGE), and Bonk (BONK) are garnering attention for their potential to yield up to 30X gains by February 2025. Here’s why these particular cryptocurrencies are worth watching. PEPETO: A Rising Star in the Crypto World PEPETO , currently priced at $0.000000103 per token, has successfully raised over $3.4 million in its ongoing presale, indicating strong market interest and investor confidence. This memecoin isn’t just about playful engagement; it’s built on a foundation of solid tech innovations including a zero-fee exchange and a cross-chain bridge that facilitates seamless token swaps. With staking rewards that support token stability and growth, PEPETO is designed for long-term viability in the blockchain ecosystem.

Every milestone has been achieved, and the… pic.twitter.com/zCmy1bTRQY — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) January 1, 2025 Dogecoin (DOGE): The Original Memecoin Dogecoin remains a significant player in the crypto space, known for its vibrant community and historical yield of massive returns. Originally created as a lighthearted alternative to more traditional cryptocurrencies, DOGE has maintained its relevance through community-driven initiatives and widespread social media endorsement. While it’s more established than many newer tokens, DOGE still shows considerable volatility that can lead to high rewards for timely investors. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s Meme Coin Phenomenon Bonk coin, made famous on the Solana blockchain, quickly captured the market’s attention with its significant trading volumes and community engagement. Despite a recent decline in price, the potential for sharp rebounds exists as the token leverages Solana’s high-speed and low-cost transactions. BONK’s market position as a memecoin with utility gives it a fighting chance for rapid growth, especially as it continues to build out its ecosystem. Why These Tokens Stand Out PEPETO , DOGE , and BONK share a common trait: they all blend the infectious appeal of memecoin cultures with practical, underlying blockchain functionalities. PEPETO, with its utility-driven features, is set up not just for short-term pumps but for sustained relevance. DOGE and BONK, meanwhile, continue to benefit from robust communities and the broader crypto market’s cyclical dynamics, which could lead to significant price surges in the short term. For investors looking towards the future, these tokens offer unique opportunities. PEPETO’s ongoing presale and its infrastructure for growth make it an attractive option for those looking to get in on the ground floor of a promising project. Meanwhile, the established popularity of DOGE and the emerging buzz around BONK provide avenues for speculative investment with the potential for high returns.

The report focuses on the ongoing decline in the Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR) and its potential impact on traditional markets and digital assets. Alphractal points out the ongoing decline of EFFR by noting its historical correlation with major economic events. Declining EFFR levels, especially when paired with other macroeconomic metrics, often signal financial crises or shifts in monetary policy. The report includes a chart that marks periods when the EFFR fell with grey areas and significant rate changes with red areas. These significant transitions have historically influenced market behavior. While Bitcoin is a relatively new asset, the report points to a notable trend: significant fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price coincided with the decline of the EFFR after August 2019. Alphractal suggests that changes in U.S. monetary policy could affect Bitcoin’s price dynamics, albeit with potential delays. The analysis highlights that it is important to monitor both macroeconomic metrics and crypto-specific indicators to predict market movements. “Market reactions, including those in Bitcoin, may take months to adjust to changes in the EFFR, which may only then lead to significant volatility,” the report says. Related News: Patient Cryptocurrency Whale Waited 9 Months for This Altcoin: Made 529x Profit Data from Alphractal points to a bullish sentiment across the market, with the overall Long/Short ratio at 3.

Litecoin ( LTC ), a popular proof-of-work coin, was stuck at $103.03, down by 30% from its highest level in 2024. This decline aligns with most cryptocurrencies, which have pared back some of the gains made last year. Litecoin’s performance was also because of the falling odds that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot LTC ETF in 2025.

You might also like: Ethereum recoils as ETF outflows, CEX balances rise, staking yield falls While a spot Litecoin ETF would be a good thing for the coin, it is unclear whether it will gain interest from institutional investors. A good example of this is the performance of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Bitcoin funds have over $107 billion in assets, 5.7% of the total market cap. Ethereum funds have $11.6 billion, 2.96% of the market cap, indicating that institutional demand is weak. Interest in Litecoin would be weaker than Ethereum since it is a smaller crypto project with a market cap of $7.7 billion. It has also lost market share in the crypto industry as its ranking has moved to 22 from being a top ten coin a few years ago. Polymarket traders are optimistic that the SEC will approve Solana ( SOL ) and Ripple (XRP) ETFs this year. The agency’s odds of approving a spot XRP ETF are 70% , while those of Solana ETFs are 73%.

The Funding Rates metric offers valuable insights into the sentiment within the perpetual futures markets, helping to gauge the likelihood of a recovery. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Ethereum has seen consistent declines following its rejection at the $4K resistance level, indicating the dominance of sellers. Most recently, another sharp decline pushed the price toward a substantial support zone, defined by the 100-day moving average of $3.1K. This dynamic support is critical as demand concentration near this region is expected to curb downward momentum, with a bullish rebound being plausible if buying interest emerges. Currently, ETH is trapped between the 100-day MA ($3.1K) and the $3.5K resistance level, forming a tight consolidation range. A decisive move in either direction will likely determine the mid-term trend. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Ethereum broke down from an ascending wedge pattern, a bearish structure that typically signals further declines. This breakdown triggered a swift sell-off, pushing the price toward a support zone defined by the 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels. This support zone has the potential to stabilize the price and possibly initiate a short-term bullish rebound. However, persistent bearish pressure could result in a break below this line, intensifying the downtrend. If Ethereum breaches this critical support zone, it may trigger panic selling, further strengthening sellers’ dominance. Conversely, a sustained rebound could pave the way for a recovery toward the $3.5K resistance level. Onchain Analysis By Shayan Examining the chart, the recent market correction has coincided with a significant decline in funding rates. This shift suggests growing bearish sentiment among speculators, with many traders betting on further decreases in ETH’s price. However, upon reaching the substantial support zone at $3K, the Funding Rates metric has started to show signs of recovery. A notable bullish spike in the metric suggests an influx of buying interest as market participants begin to open long positions in anticipation of a price rebound. If this recovery in funding rates continues, it could indicate sustained demand and the potential for a bullish rebound from the $3K support. On the other hand, if the current recovery loses momentum or reverses, it would signal a return to bearish sentiment, paving the way for a deeper correction.

The asset has since consolidated within a descending wedge pattern, bounded by the $0.8-$1.3 range. Despite the failure to reclaim the $1.3 level, Cardano benefits from robust support at $0.8, which aligns with the following: The 100-day moving average. A key pivot point from prior price action. This suggests that the current price action is likely a corrective pullback to retest the $0.8 region. A breakout above the descending wedge could pave the way for a fresh rally, targeting the $1.3 resistance and potentially initiating a mid-term uptrend. The 4-Hour Chart In the 4-hour timeframe, ADA recently surged from the wedge’s lower boundary ($0.75) and managed to break above the upper trendline of the wedge pattern. Following this breakout, the price has retraced toward the broken trendline, forming a bullish pullback that confirms the breakout’s validity. The price is now oscillating within a critical range, bounded by the 0.5 Fibonacci level ($0.8) as support and the $1.3 resistance region as the next major barrier. A valid breakout above the current consolidation range is essential for Cardano to establish its next trend direction. A bullish breakout could lead to a sustained surge, while failing to hold the $0.8 support may result in further declines.

Dogecoin Gains Momentum Amid Bullish Signals and Altcoin Optimism Dogecoin is showing positive signs as it trades between $0.326 and $0.4189. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is over 60, indicating strong buying interest. The high stochastic value suggests that momentum is on the rise. If the price moves past the resistance level at $0.4553, it could continue its upward trend. Over the past six months, Dogecoin has increased by nearly 200%, hinting at significant growth potential. With the anticipated altcoin season and a bullish crypto market, there's optimism that DOGE may reach higher levels. However, keeping an eye on the support level at $0.2695 is important in case of any market fluctuations. Polkadot Aims for $10 as Altcoin Season Nears Polkadot's price ranges between $6.78 and $8.29, showing steady movement. The RSI is around 57, indicating growing momentum. With strong support at $5.89 and the price nearing the 10-day moving average, Polkadot may soon challenge the resistance at $8.91. Breaking this level could lead to the next target at $10.42, offering over 20% potential upside. Despite a recent monthly drop of about 19%, the six-month change is positive at over 8%. The approaching altcoin season might boost Polkadot's price further, making it a promising option in the crypto market. XRP Gathers Momentum for Potential Surge Amid Bullish Indicators XRP is trading between $2.09 and $2.61, showing signs of consolidation. The price is close to the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages, hinting at a possible upward move. The nearest resistance is at $2.81; breaking above it could push XRP to the next level at $3.32. With a 6-month price surge of over 339%, momentum is on XRP's side. The Relative Strength Index is around 54, indicating room for growth before hitting overbought territory. If the bullish trend continues, XRP could experience significant gains soon. Traders are eyeing a breakout above resistance levels, which could signal a strong rally. Cardano (ADA) Shows Potential for Growth Amid Strong Market Signals Cardano is trading between $0.91 and $1.20, showing signs of rising. The price has increased by 0.62% over the past week, suggesting growing interest. If it moves past the nearby barrier at $1.30, there could be room to climb toward the next level at $1.59, which would be a significant increase. The coin has gained 119% over six months, highlighting its strong performance. Indicators show strong buying interest, hinting at potential growth ahead. With the average price over the past 10 days nearing the 100-day average, there might be potential for further growth. Conclusion While popular coins like DOGE, DOT, XRP, and ADA may offer steady growth, they have less short-term potential. DOGEN stands out as a token designed for those who seek luxury and success. With expected 700% growth in the presale and potential for thousand-fold returns, it's building a community of leaders and offers real benefits for early adopters.

For 2025, three altcoins stand out as strong contenders: Dogecoin, Pepe, and Doge Uprising . While all three have unique attributes, Doge Uprising is emerging as a revolutionary project with unparalleled potential. Let’s explore why these three coins could transform your crypto journey. Doge Uprising: Overthrowing The Crypto Titans Doge Uprising ($DUP) is more than just a cryptocurrency; it’s a movement. Inspired by a dystopian narrative where rebels rise against authoritarian rule, Doge Uprising offers a community-driven ecosystem that fuses storytelling with cutting-edge blockchain technology. At its core, $DUP empowers holders with opportunities to participate in staking, gaming, and NFT ownership. The project’s unique Doge Mecha NFTs play a pivotal role in its ecosystem. These ultra-rare digital assets aren’t just collectables, they symbolize rebellion and are integral to the immersive gaming experience Doge Uprising offers. Built on the ERC-20 Ethereum blockchain, the project ensures high security and scalability, making it a reliable investment. The presale phase offers the lowest entry point for $DUP, presenting a golden opportunity for early investors to join the uprising. With its roadmap focusing on community engagement, utility expansion, and decentralized governance, Doge Uprising is well-positioned to dominate the altcoin market in 2025. Its narrative-driven approach, combined with robust technical features, makes it a standout option for those looking to turn their portfolios into millions. Dogecoin: The Original Meme Coin Dogecoin, the trailblazer of meme coins, continues to be a force to reckon with. Initially created as a joke, Dogecoin has grown into a widely recognized cryptocurrency with strong community support and real-world use cases. Its simplicity and accessibility have made it a popular choice for newcomers to the crypto space. In 2025, Dogecoin’s potential lies in its increasing adoption for microtransactions and tipping, thanks to its low transaction fees and fast processing times. High-profile endorsements, including those from Elon Musk, have kept Dogecoin in the spotlight, and its consistent presence in the market makes it a reliable addition to any portfolio. Pepe: The Meme Coin with a Viral Edge Pepe, inspired by the iconic internet meme, has carved out its niche in the crypto world. Unlike many meme coins, Pepe has a strong focus on community-driven growth and viral marketing campaigns. Its playful nature and ability to connect with younger, meme-savvy audiences have contributed to its rising popularity. In 2025, Pepe’s roadmap includes expanded partnerships, NFT integrations, and gamified experiences, all aimed at solidifying its position in the altcoin market. For investors looking to capitalize on the next big meme coin trend, Pepe offers a promising opportunity to diversify their portfolios. Which Do I Pick For My Chance At Millions? Dogecoin, Pepe, and Doge Uprising each bring unique strengths to the table, but Doge Uprising stands out as a transformative project with the potential to turn dreams into reality. By combining innovative technology with a compelling narrative, $DUP offers investors a chance to be part of something bigger than just another cryptocurrency. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to join the uprising and take your crypto portfolio to new heights.

Here are key developments making buzz in the Terra Luna Classic community. Terra Luna Classic Forks Removal Software Upgrade Blockchain developer Orbit Labs announced the completion of the first phase of the removal of the fork modules. The upgrade proposal will be put up for governance voting next week and the mainnet upgrade is planned to happen in February. “We have successfully transitioned all relevant logic and code that were previously part of the forked repository. The changes include the following repositories and associated modules.” According to the developer group , the upgrade will bring Terra Luna Classic into alignment with the mainstream Cosmos ecosystem. It makes security updates and maintenance easy. This includes the fix of multi-send handling for the “reverse charge” implementation. Billions of LUNC and USTC Tokens Burn The Terra Luna Classic community is planning major LUNC and USTC burn campaigns after Terraform Labs bankruptcy. With support from Binance LUNC burn mechanism , the community has burned nearly 400 billion LUNC tokens in total. Currently, the community plans to burn 1.8 billion USTC in Luna Foundation Guard-linked wallets, burning all USTC in the Oracle rewards pool, and burn LUNC and USTC in wallets no one has access to. The plans were proposed by Lunanauts validator, hoping for potential repeg. Burn it. TFL case is over. LFG doesn't exist. Just burn it. — fragwuerdig | Juris Protocol (@frag_dude) January 12, 2025 Building for Utility on Terra Classic Network Recently, the network was successfully boosted with “ Upgrade to v3.3.0 ” to increase utility on the Terra Luna Classic, removing barriers for developers and dapps wanting to build on the chain. The Terra Luna Classic ecosystem is growing with Terraport, LBUN, Selenium, Garuda DEX, and TerraCasino. Selenium Protocol was created in line with Mirror Protocol, the most important protocol of the Terra chain. Terra Co-Founder Do Kwon’s Criminal Trial Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon was finally extradited to the U.S. authorities, but he pled not guilty to a nine-count indictment charging him with securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud and money laundering conspiracy. Do Kwon’s criminal fraud trial will likely not begin until January 2026 as prosecutors work on unlocking encrypted devices and translating communications from Korean into English. LUNC and USTC Prices to Recover LUNC price is down 15% in a week amid the broader crypto market crash, with the price currently trading at $0.0001022. The 24-hour low and high are $0.0001012 and $0.0001046, respectively. As per an analysis, LUNC price is following the altcoin market trend exactly. The price is at the key Fibonacci 0.618 level. Additionally, trading volume remains at the lowest level. These sections do not last long, cause extreme volatility, and usually have a set direction. “In the end, LUNC has no choice but to depend on the movement of Ethereum along with the decline in Bitcoin dominance, and it is very important to support it without major deviations from the current section.” Meanwhile, USTC price climbed nearly 1%, with the price now trading at $0.0185.

According to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Travis Ford used Wolf Capital’s website, social media and internet-based promotional activities to solicit investments between January 2023 and August 2023. Court documents show that the 35-year-old Oklahoma resident enticed investors by presenting himself as a sophisticated trader who can give high returns of 1% to 2% per day, or approximately 547% in one year. “Ford made such false promises to induce members of the public to invest money in the company.” The DOJ says Ford has now admitted that he did not believe it is possible to consistently deliver the promised returns. Wolf Capital managed to raise $9.4 million from 2,800 investors, but Ford misappropriated and diverted the funds to benefit himself and other conspirators, causing financial damage to the investors. On Thursday, he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The crime is punishable by up to five years of prison time, but a federal district court judge will determine the appropriate sentence after considering US sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors. The court has not yet set the sentencing date.

As we enter the new year, the industry highlights three projects currently making headlines: Ripple (XRP), Fantom (FTM), and this rising sensation, DTX Exchange (DTX). Over the years, Ripple and Fantom have become prominent in their respective use cases and utilities. However, DTX Exchange stands out, offering early adopters significant returns. This viral altcoin has surpassed experts’ expectations with its recent 150% surge in presale price. This article shares more details as to what sets these projects apart. Ripple (XRP): A Top Altcoin Armed with Resilience Ripple has proved resilient in the crypto market despite its ongoing regulatory battle. Its goal of making cross-border payments faster and cheaper has proved successful. As a result, the XRP price made a dramatic climb to an all-time high of $3.84. Yet, its ongoing legal hurle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This situation has slowed its momentum to the upside. But, Ripple remains unfazed and is committed to deliver more innovation. There have been rumors that the first XRP ETF would attract institutional investors seeking faster and more transparent payment systems. The Ripple (XRP) price is currently around $2.4 . If current market dynamics persist, traders could experience more selling pressure. However, given the anticipated bull cycle in 2025, this asset may soon regain its former glory. Fantom (FTM): A Top Altcoin Merging Innovation with Market Volatility Fantom (FTM) is another token that gained impressive traction in the last market bull cycle. Positioned as an efficient and scalable blockchain platform, this asset has become a favorite for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. However, the excitement surrounding the FTM price has waned in recent weeks, slipping below $0.8 . While this decline reflects broader market volatility and increased selling pressure by traders, Fantom remains a notable player that could still deliver more gains soon. Notably, crypto analysts suggest that as market conditions stabilize, traders can see FTM’s price return to its all-time high of $3.48. For now, it’s facing the challenge of defending its critical support while competing with newer entrants like DTX Exchange. DTX Exchange (DTX): The Rising Star of 2025 With Hybrid Trading Capabilities As Ripple (XRP) and Fantom (FTM) navigate the complexities of being established in the market, DTX Exchange (DTX) may be the standout performer in 2025. So far, it has surpassed expectations, gaining over 600% in its presale stages and proving to be a revolutionary platform that will reshape trading. This viral altcoin combines the strengths of centralized and decentralized exchanges, enabling traders to access 120,000+ financial instruments — including stocks, commodities, cryptos, and tokenized ETFs — all from a single interface. Furthermore, it supports a 1:1,000 leverage for all assets, assisting users with smaller portfolios in maximizing their gains. Furthermore, the platform introduces Phoenix Wallet, which offers non-custodial storage for traders, ensuring they retain full control of their assets. Additional features like copy trading and automated bots add a competitive edge to help traders refine their strategies and maximize returns. The DTX Exchange presale has been remarkable so far. With over $11.3 million raised, early backers of this project have enjoyed substantial gains, with the token’s price climbing from $0.02 to $0.14. Interestingly, DTX plans to launch on top-tier exchanges in Q1 2025, with experts anticipating a 10x surge. Final Verdict Ripple (XRP) and Fantom (FTM) remain key players that investors and traders believe have bullish prospects. Despite their strengths and challenges, these cryptos continue to stand the test of time and adapt to the market’s dynamics. DTX Exchange also emerges as an innovative altcoin with a hybrid trading model. This project offers a unique value proposition that may appeal to all kinds of traders. Its recent 150% surge attests to its growth potential and could be a project worth checking out this new year. Do you want to learn more about DTX Exchange?

Web3Bay’s 6430% ROI Steals the Spotlight In 2025 The cryptocurrency sector continues to captivate with fresh developments that keep the community on its toes. BitTorrent Chain ($BTTC) is in the spotlight with its target price of $5 by 2025. On another front, Stacks, a key Bitcoin Layer 2 network, faced a five-hour disruption that paused all transactions. In this vibrant environment, Web3Bay (3BAY) has risen as an influential new web3 blockchain project. With a presale attracting significant investment due to the promise of a 6,430% return, the platform has quickly gained traction. So far, Web3Bay has secured $590K and distributed over 180 million coins. As it continues to develop, the platform promises to redefine blockchain investment opportunities. BitTorrent Price Target: Can $5 Be Reached by 2025? Debate surrounds the possibility of BitTorrent Chain ($BTTC) hitting a $5 price target within the next few years. Achieving this will largely depend on its growth within an expanding Web3 framework. $BTTC is making strides with its decentralized applications and peer-to-peer sharing features, marking it as a vital part of the decentralized ecosystem. Yet, significant hurdles remain, particularly the need for a huge market demand or extensive token burns due to its large circulating supply. Stacks News: Overcoming Challenges in the Layer 2 Network Stacks, a notable Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, recently navigated a five-hour outage that stopped block production, attributed to a decline in signer activity. This incident underlined the challenges of scaling blockchain technologies. Stacks quickly mobilized its development team and signers to rectify the issue, leading to a prompt recovery. The outage coincided with enhancements from the Nakamoto Upgrade intended to improve transaction speeds and enhance network security. Despite the hiccup, Stacks maintained its market position, reflecting ongoing trust in its future prospects. 6430% ROI Possibility—Why Web3Bay’s Current Price is a Great Steal Web3Bay (3BAY) is charting a new course in e-commerce by leveraging blockchain technology to create a fully decentralized platform. This approach not only facilitates smoother transactions but also empowers users to manage digital assets with the utmost flexibility. Web3Bay champions a trading environment that is safe, transparent, and independent of central oversight. The platform’s thriving presale, which has attracted $590,000 and distributed over 180 million tokens so far, speaks volumes about its potential and appeal to investors. With token prices set to increase in upcoming presale phases, now is an excellent time to invest. By investing now, participants can lock in tokens at a lower cost and set themselves up for impressive future gains as Web3Bay expands. With a projected ROI of 6430%, Web3Bay is marking itself as a leading opportunity for early involvement in cutting-edge Web3 blockchain initiatives. The limited availability of tokens and the growing demand create a timely investment opportunity. As Web3Bay continues to draw interest from the crypto community, early investors are well-positioned to benefit from the project’s robust growth trajectory. Key Insights The cryptocurrency landscape is filled with potential yet accompanied by complexities. While BitTorrent works towards a significant price target amid market and competitive pressures, Stacks continues to refine its infrastructure following operational setbacks. Web3Bay emerges as a beacon for potential investors. Having already raised significant funds and distributed millions of tokens at a competitive price, and with a projected ROI of 6430%, Web3Bay offers a unique investment chance before the next price increment. With diminishing token availability and increasing demand, the present moment is optimal for engaging with this promising web3 blockchain project.

Donald Pumps (DONPUMPS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONPUMPS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Pumps can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Pumps could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Pumps launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Pumps on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Pumps by entering its contract address – 4AiQS1KegadchxjSm4hmifemyRE7gyk3Hieca9wGXGts – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONPUMPS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 18:00:56

Bitcoin remained below $95,000, while meme coins like Dogwifhat ( WIF ), Popcat ( POPCAT ), and Bonk ( BONK ) were among the top laggards. US bond yields continued rising after the labor statistics released strong nonfarm payroll numbers, which raised the possibility that the Federal Reserve will maintain a hawkish tone this year. The economy added over $260,000 jobs in December, while the jobless rate fell to 4.1%. Arbitrum ( ARB ), Ondo Finance ( ONDO ), and Zetachain ( ZETA ) are the top cryptocurrencies to watch this week. Arbitrum Arbitrum chart | Source: crypto.news Arbitrum, the second-biggest layer-2 network, will be a key cryptocurrency to watch this week as the network unlocks tokens worth $67 million or 1.08% of the float. It has already unlocked 53% of all its tokens, with the final release set to happen in April 2027. Arbitrum’s token has been in a downtrend in the past 12 months and is now down by 70% from its highest level in 2024. This decline happened as the network lost market share to Base Blockchain. Arbitrum token has recently slipped below the 50-day and 25-day Exponential Moving Averages and is hovering slightly above the key support at $0.70, which it has failed to move below since December. A break below that level will point to more downside, potentially to $0.4625, its lowest level in November. You might also like: Ethereum recoils as ETF outflows, CEX balances rise, staking yield falls Ondo Finance Ondo Finance | source: Crypto.news Ondo Finance is another crypto to watch as the network unlocks tokens worth $2.38 billion or 133% of the float on Thursday. The network has a circulating supply of 1.38 billion and a maximum supply of 10 billion. Its token unlocks will run until 2029. Ondo could benefit most from rising bond yields as investors move to money market funds. Its USDY and OUSG stablecoins yield 4.35% and 3.28%, respectively. However, it is unclear ONDO’s performance will benefit from its growth. On the daily chart, the token has dropped from last December’s high of $2.13 to $1.23. It has also moved below the 50-day and 25-day moving averages and the key support at $1.4800, its highest swing in June last year. On the positive side, ONDO has formed a falling wedge pattern, whose two lines are nearing their confluence levels. This pattern could point to more gains, potentially to $1.4800. Zetachain Zetachain price chart | Source: crypto.news Zetachain, a cryptocurrency with a market cap of $337 million, will also be in the spotlight as it unlocks tokens worth $145 million or 49% of the market value. The token has been in a strong downtrend after peaking at $1.3752 in June last year. This decline happened as the total value locked in its DeFi TVL dropped from $16 million in November to $7 million today. The ZETA token has remained below all moving averages. It has also settled at the key support at $0.5328, its lowest swing since October last year. The coin has also remained below the 50-day moving average. Therefore, a break below that support will point to more downside, potentially to $0.3530, its lowest point in 2024.

Kaspa: The Cryptocurrency That's Redefining Speed Kaspa is a new kind of cryptocurrency that's all about speed. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which can be slow because they create one block at a time, Kaspa uses something called the GHOSTDAG protocol. This allows many blocks to be created at once without any getting left behind. Think of it like many people walking together instead of one by one. This makes Kaspa's network incredibly fast, currently processing one block every second, with hopes to reach ten or even a hundred blocks per second in the future. In today's fast-paced crypto market, speed and efficiency are key. Kaspa's unique approach could give it an edge over other cryptocurrencies that struggle with slow transaction times. Features like easy network querying and data pruning make it even more appealing. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, Kaspa's technology shows promise. It could attract users who want quick transactions without the delays. Compared to older coins that might not adapt as quickly, Kaspa seems poised to meet the demands of modern crypto enthusiasts. Sui Simplifies Blockchain: A New Era of User Experience Sui is a new blockchain platform built to be powerful and easy to use. It aims to support global adoption by being secure, scalable, and friendly for developers. Unlike other blockchains, Sui uses a special way of handling data that focuses on objects. This, along with the secure Move programming language, helps it overcome common problems found in other blockchain systems. What makes Sui stand out is its focus on the user experience. It removes barriers that often make blockchain interactions hard. With features like zkLogin and sponsored transactions, apps become more accessible to everyone. In a market where ease of use is becoming more important, Sui's approach looks promising. Compared to other coins, Sui might catch the eye of those looking for both strong technology and user-friendly design. Stellar Lumens: Connecting the World Through Fast and Cheap Payments Imagine sending money to anyone, anywhere, in seconds. That's the promise of Stellar Lumens (XLM). Founded in 2014, Stellar is a decentralized network that uses blockchain to move funds quickly and cheaply. It doesn't favor any country's currency and even has its own digital coin called Lumens. Big companies are noticing too, partnering with Stellar to make global transactions smoother. Unlike some cryptocurrencies that want to replace banks, Stellar aims to make them better by helping different financial systems work together. In today's market, Stellar stands out. With its ability to handle any type of currency, including digital versions of national money and other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, it's versatile. People can use apps built on Stellar to send money around the world. Businesses can create blockchain applications or handle payments and currency exchanges seamlessly. Compared to other coins, Stellar's focus on enhancing existing systems, rather than overturning them, gives it a unique edge. As the crypto space evolves, Stellar's commitment to improving financial connections makes it an attractive option to watch. Aave: The Future of Decentralized Lending Unveiled Aave is transforming how we think about borrowing and lending. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, it offers a decentralized system where users can lend, borrow, and earn interest on cryptocurrencies without the need for intermediaries like banks. Smart contracts handle all transactions, ensuring that trust is established through code rather than traditional institutions. With support for 17 different cryptocurrencies, users receive aTokens when they lend, representing their loan and accruing interest over time. What sets Aave apart is its introduction of flash loans. These are instant loans that require no collateral but must be repaid within the same blockchain block, capitalizing on Ethereum's 13-second block time. The AAVE token is central to this ecosystem, providing holders with benefits like fee reductions and voting rights on protocol updates. It can also be used as collateral, offering additional perks. The platform's Safety Module allows users to stake their AAVE tokens, enhancing security and risk mitigation. In a market crowded with cryptocurrencies, Aave stands out with its innovative features and strong potential for growth, making it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Conclusion KAS, SUI, XLM, and AAVE offer strong potential, but XYZVerse (XYZ), combining sports enthusiasm with meme culture and aiming for massive growth, could be the standout investment.

Solana (SOL) Over the past week, Solana (SOL) dropped by 7.85%. In the last month, it fell by 10.27%. However, over six months, SOL has risen by 34.96%. This shows that while there have been recent declines, the coin has grown over the longer term. SOL is currently trading between $192.85 and $226.85. The nearest support level is $172.30. This means if the price falls, it might stop there. The nearest resistance level is $240. If the price rises, it might face a hurdle there. The next resistance is at $274, which could be a significant gain if reached. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The 10-day simple moving average is $190.34, and the 100-day average is $201.73. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 55.01, suggesting the coin is in a neutral zone. The Stochastic is high at 89.82, which might mean the coin is overbought. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.08937. Based on this data, SOL's price could either rise or fall. Key levels to watch are the support at $172.30 and the resistance at $240. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) has shown mixed performance in recent times. Over the past week, its price dipped by 0.83%, and it decreased by 6.74% over the last month. However, looking at the bigger picture, ADA has surged by an impressive 115.84% in the past six months. This significant growth highlights its strong momentum despite short-term fluctuations. Currently trading between $0.91 and $1.20, ADA faces immediate resistance at $1.30. Breaking through this level could pave the way to the next resistance at $1.59, offering potential gains of around 33%. On the flip side, the nearest support is at $0.72, with a deeper support level at $0.43. A drop to these supports could imply a decrease of approximately 53% from current prices. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.94, and the 100-day average is $1.00, indicating that the price is hovering near these key indicators. Technical metrics paint a cautious picture. The Relative Strength Index is at 59.97, edging close to overbought territory, which might limit immediate upward movement. The Stochastic oscillator reads 79.92, supporting this view of potential short-term resistance. Meanwhile, the MACD level of 0.00656 points to slight bullish momentum. Considering these factors, ADA may experience challenges in breaking higher in the short term. Nonetheless, its substantial growth over the past six months suggests that if it surpasses the $1.30 resistance, there could be significant room for upward movement. Investors will be watching these levels closely to gauge ADA's next direction. Conclusion While SOL and ADA remain solid choices, XYZVerse's unique fusion of meme culture and sports is poised to deliver unprecedented growth in the 2025 bull run.

Solana (SOL) Over the past week, Solana (SOL) dropped by 7.85%. In the last month, it fell by 10.27%. However, over six months, SOL has risen by 34.96%. This shows that while there have been recent declines, the coin has grown over the longer term. SOL is currently trading between $192.85 and $226.85. The nearest support level is $172.30. This means if the price falls, it might stop there. The nearest resistance level is $240. If the price rises, it might face a hurdle there. The next resistance is at $274, which could be a significant gain if reached. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The 10-day simple moving average is $190.34, and the 100-day average is $201.73. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 55.01, suggesting the coin is in a neutral zone. The Stochastic is high at 89.82, which might mean the coin is overbought. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.08937. Based on this data, SOL's price could either rise or fall. Key levels to watch are the support at $172.30 and the resistance at $240. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) has shown mixed performance in recent times. Over the past week, its price dipped by 0.83%, and it decreased by 6.74% over the last month. However, looking at the bigger picture, ADA has surged by an impressive 115.84% in the past six months. This significant growth highlights its strong momentum despite short-term fluctuations. Currently trading between $0.91 and $1.20, ADA faces immediate resistance at $1.30. Breaking through this level could pave the way to the next resistance at $1.59, offering potential gains of around 33%. On the flip side, the nearest support is at $0.72, with a deeper support level at $0.43. A drop to these supports could imply a decrease of approximately 53% from current prices. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.94, and the 100-day average is $1.00, indicating that the price is hovering near these key indicators. Technical metrics paint a cautious picture. The Relative Strength Index is at 59.97, edging close to overbought territory, which might limit immediate upward movement. The Stochastic oscillator reads 79.92, supporting this view of potential short-term resistance. Meanwhile, the MACD level of 0.00656 points to slight bullish momentum. Considering these factors, ADA may experience challenges in breaking higher in the short term. Nonetheless, its substantial growth over the past six months suggests that if it surpasses the $1.30 resistance, there could be significant room for upward movement. Investors will be watching these levels closely to gauge ADA's next direction. Conclusion While SOL and ADA remain solid choices, XYZVerse's unique fusion of meme culture and sports is poised to deliver unprecedented growth in the 2025 bull run.

Peter Brandt Weighs In",https://zycrypto.com/can-the-classic-hump-pump-and-dump-cycle-propel-bitcoin-to-150000-peter-brandt-weighs-in/,"Veteran trader Peter Brandt has predicted a slight slump for Bitcoin’s (BTC) price before a major rally with his latest observations of a recurring pattern he calls the “Hump, Pump, and Dump.” In a tweet on Saturday, Brandt suggested Bitcoin could face one final pullback or extended sideways movement before a major rally, potentially driving the price to over $150,000. “The big question in my mind is whether Bitcoin will get one more dump (or lengthier congestive chop) before the pump. Remember, markets generally do not sour until retail traders get worn out,” Brandt wrote, alongside a chart showing a possible slight dip before the next big leg up. The tweet comes just days after the seasoned chartist pointed out the significance of a head-and-shoulders pattern forming within the larger hump-pump cycle. On Dec 29, Brandt commented , “ This is a head-and-shoulders top pattern. It might complete and take price to $78,000; it might fail with a thrust higher; or, it might morph into something else. But as it stands, it must be dealt with for what it is.” Notably, the “Hump, Slump, Pump, and Dump” cycle has historically characterized major Bitcoin bull runs. This pattern typically begins with an initial price surge (hump), followed by a retracement (slump), a recovery (pump), another correction (dump), and a final explosive rally (pump). “ This is the price behavior that separates chumps from their money,” Brandt has previously said about the pattern, highlighting how retail investors often FOMO into pumps only to sell at a loss during dumps. Supporting Brandt’s thesis, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju and other analysts have recently echoed the likelihood of this pattern playing out again. Elsewhere, popular crypto analyst Axel Kibar, in a recent tweet, Kibar suggested that the head-and-shoulders formation could initially target $80,000 before further growth . That said, recent Glassnode data adds weight to the possibility of a continued consolidation phase. While Bitcoin prices are about 12% lower than recent highs, long-term holders (LTH) are still distributing their holdings, albeit at a slower pace. Glassnode analysts noted that the 30-day distribution rate has reached extreme values seen in past cycles. However, according to the analysts, this doesn’t necessarily indicate the end of the bull market. “ In previous cycles, prices continued to rise even after LTH distribution peaked,” they explained on Jan. 10. Interestingly, the supply held by newer investors, or coins aged less than three months, has risen to 49.6%, signaling robust demand from fresh market participants. At prior cycle peaks in 2018 and 2021, this metric reached 85% and 74%, respectively. BTC was trading at $94,191 at press time, reflecting a 0.14% drop in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-12 18:15:57

At the same time, the Ethereum market showed similar struggles as the prominent altcoin declined by 10% over the past seven days. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Bounce Back? Crypto Analysts Discuss Potential Price Recovery Ethereum ETFs Net Assets Drop Below $12 Billion Amid Strong Outflows Following a negative performance in the first week of 2025, the Ethereum Spot ETFs are struggling to rediscover their bullish form as another trading week was marred by higher withdrawals than deposits by investors. According to data from ETF tracking site SoSoValue, the week began on a positive note as the Ethereum ETFs rallied to record $128.72 million in net inflows on January 6. However, this positive momentum was overshadowed by three consecutive days of cumulative net losses of $314.61 million leading to a weekly net outflow of $185.89 million. During the course of this week, Fidelity’s FETH registered the largest net outflows valued at $276.13 million. This figure was followed by minimal withdrawals from Grayscale’s ETHE, ETH and Bitwise’s ETHW estimated to the tune of $16.12 million, $14.60 million and $3.05 million, respectively. BlackRock’s ETHA was the only ETF to see a net inflow totalling $124.11 million while VanEck’s ETHV, Invesco’s QETH, 21Shares’ CETH, and Franklin Templeton’s EZET reported no net flows. Following the Ethereum Spot ETFs underperformance, their total net assets for has declined by 10.89% to $11.61 Billion, representing 2.96% of the Ethereum market cap. Meanwhile, the cumulative total net inflow for these investment funds has now climbed to $2.45 billion. As expected, Grayscale’s ETHE continues to lead the market with net assets totaling $4.57 billion, while BlackRock’s ETHA maintains its dominance with $3.68 billion in net flows since the launch of these Ethereum ETFs in July. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Explains What Could Trigger Ethereum Rally To $6,000 Ethereum Crashes By 10% Due To General Market Struggles In other news, data from CoinMarketCap shows the price of Ethereum declined by 10.06% in the past week in line with wide scale losses across the crypto market. Notably, this price loss was accompanied by $1.4 billion in exchange outflows, as many bullish investors looked to accumulate popular altcoin at lower prices. At press time, Ethereum trades at $3,287 following a slight gain of 0.58% in the last 24 hours. During this period, the asset’s trading volume has plummeted by 55.98% and is now valued at $11.75 billion. In making any headway, ETH would need to break past the immediate resistance at $3,350 which may ignite a rally to around $3,700.

On Saturday, the pundit revealed that Shibarium has processed almost 800 million transactions, a figure he boasted was “8 times Charles Hoskinson’s Cardano.” The comment came as a response to a Shiba community member, Murat Aydın, who expressed concerns about the clarity of Shibarium’s roadmap. Aydın’s criticism revolved around the lack of communication about the network’s ongoing testing phase and the uncertainty surrounding the utility of BONE, the ecosystem’s gas fee token. In his reply, Kusama refuted the notion that Shibarium was still in testing, stating, “Did you just say Shibarium is being tested? Bro, there are 700M transactions.” He further emphasized the team’s ongoing efforts to enhance the ecosystem, including a redesigned website and a recently released podcast to address concerns and highlight their “incredible tech.” Notably, the exchange highlights the growing anticipation within the SHIB Army as the ecosystem prepares for the launch of the TREAT token in less than three days. TREAT, short for “Transactional Rewards for Engagement and Access Token,” is designed to provide rewards and enhance user engagement across Shibarium’s various projects. The token is expected to debut on major exchanges, including Bitget, Gate, KuCoin, and MEXC. In a blog post on the same day, Kusama elaborated on the broader vision for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, introducing concepts like “36 Chambers of Tech” and “WHY Combinator.” According to Kusama, the ecosystem aims to compete with larger blockchain networks by developing a comprehensive technology stack that includes AI, Web3 games, a metaverse, decentralized identity solutions, and more. Kusama explained the significance of TREAT in this ecosystem, describing it as a utility token that will incentivize user participation through weekly “TreatDrops” and grant access to various features within the network. Despite the focus on TREAT, Kusama also reassured the community about BONE’s critical role as Shibarium’s gas token. He hinted at upcoming developments, including Layer 3 solutions and optimistic rollups, which could settle transactions directly on Shibarium, further increasing $BONE’s utility. “Imagine giving this utility to BONE,” Kusama said, comparing Shibarium’s potential to data availability layers like Celestia. He also teased new cross-chain capabilities facilitated by Chainlink integration, positioning Shibarium as a hub for future blockchain projects. That said, with nearly 800 million transactions processed, Shibarium is solidifying its place as a major blockchain contender, surpassing Cardano in volume. Kusama’s remarks underscore the ecosystem’s rapid progress and ambitious vision, setting the stage for significant growth in 2025.",Cryptocurrency|News|SHIB|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|LINK|SHIB,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-12 18:46:21

Layer 2s have made quite a buzz over the last few months because of their high network activity. Arbitrum led the Layer 2 pack with a total value locked (TVL) of $3.25 billion. Arbitrum is an Optimistic Rollup solution that shifts network operations away from the Ethereum mainnet while maintaining Ethereum-level security. Arbitrum’s BOLD testnet also went live; when integrated into the mainnet, the update will enable permissionless validation on Arbitrum.

This comes after several major events, including a severe hack and legal issues. The platform’s decision to wind down follows a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As the final chapter unfolds, Mango’s story serves as a stark reminder of the challenges that can bring even promising crypto projects to an abrupt end. The Final Moves: Governance Proposals and Economic Impacts In a recent X post, Mango shared its announced shutdown plans with its community. The post clarified that Mango v4 and Boost, specific components of the Mango Markets platform, will no longer be available. Also, the ongoing borrowing on the platform would become economically unviable. This decision comes after the platform’s governance DAO approved changes to interest rates and collateral requirements. This makes borrowing and lending on the platform impractical. The proposals, supported unanimously by the Mango community, are set to take effect on January 13. These changes reflect the team’s efforts to bring the platform to a structured and deliberate end rather than leaving it to collapse on its own. The Exploit That Shook Mango Markets Mango’s troubles began in October 2022 when Avraham “Avi” Eisenberg executed what he called a “highly profitable trading strategy.” Eisenberg manipulated the price of Mango’s native MNGO token, draining $110 million from the platform. While Eisenberg maintained that his actions were within the platform’s rules, a New York jury convicted him of fraud in April 2024 . He has since requested a new trial, but the damage to Mango’s reputation and operations was irreversible. Legal Battles and the SEC Settlement In mid-2024, Mango’s governance DAO agreed to settle charges brought by the SEC . The lawsuit accused Mango DAO, Mango Labs, and a Panama-based entity called Blockworks Foundation of selling unregistered crypto assets. It also alleged that they operated as an unregistered broker. As part of the settlement, Mango’s governance DAO and development organization were required to destroy their MNGO tokens and ensure they were delisted from all exchanges. This settlement effectively sealed the fate of the platform’s native token and eroded its operational foundation. Adding to Mango’s woes, Mango’s team was divided over locked MNGO tokens acquired from the FTX estate. The lawsuits and disputes deepened the cracks in the organization . By January 3, Mango co-founder Maximilian Schneider took to Discord to propose a “graceful shutdown” of the platform.

The proposal , authored by Ethan Peck, an early investor at Meta and member of The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), comes as part of a growing trend among major corporations and their investors to explore Bitcoin’s potential as a reserve asset. The proposal, titled “Bitcoin Treasury Assessment,” outlined why Meta should evaluate Bitcoin as part of its asset allocation strategy. It highlighted Meta’s $72 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 2024, arguing that such assets erode in value due to inflation and low bond yields. “ Since cash is consistently being debased and bond yields are lower than the true inflation rate, 2.28% of Meta’s total assets are consistently diminishing shareholder value simply by sitting on the balance sheet,” the proposal asserted Peck also expanded on this point in an interview with Pahueg, host of the Less Noise More Signal YouTube channel. “Corporations are holding a lot of cash and buying a lot of bonds, but those cash reserves and bonds are just sitting there on the balance sheet, losing value,” He explained . “They’re not doing anything to address it. The best solution to that is Bitcoin.” The proposal further noted Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s personal connection to Bitcoin, famously naming one of his goats “Bitcoin.” Meta board member Marc Andreessen, who has publicly praised Bitcoin, is also a director at Coinbase, signaling a potential alignment between the company’s leadership and the cryptocurrency. “Meta has always been a forward-thinking, innovative company – not a company that follows tradition but one that sets it,” the proposal read, urging Meta to explore Bitcoin as a modern alternative to traditional treasury strategies. It also pointed to BlackRock, Meta’s second-largest institutional shareholder, which has advised that a 2% Bitcoin allocation is reasonable. This development aligns with similar shareholder proposals at Amazon and Microsoft , both spearheaded by NCPPR. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin community has also urged Dell founder Michael Dell to consider a Bitcoin strategy. Last year, Dell fueled speculation with cryptic posts on X, including the phrase, “Scarcity creates value,” a sentiment often associated with Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins, which even caught the attention of Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor. Bitcoin’s rising adoption among corporations has gained traction following its recent surge to a record high of $108,268. Proponents argue that Bitcoin offers long-term value and inflation resistance despite its volatility. Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have already adopted Bitcoin as part of their treasury strategies, with MicroStrategy’s stock outperforming Meta’s by over 2,000% in the past five years.",Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News|META,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-12 18:56:03

This vision stems from B²'s rich BTC data and robust Data Availability (DA) functionality, providing a decentralized, secure, and transparent growth environment for AI agents. Exploring BTC On-Chain Data: Unlocking the Future of AI Ecosystems Since the launch of the B² mainnet, over 101 million on-chain transactions have been processed. During the analysis of these transactions, the B² team identified a notable pattern: certain interaction behaviors on-chain exhibit the traits of early ""AI agents."" These agents perform basic tasks through decentralized applications (dApps) and reward mechanisms, demonstrating initial self-management capabilities. This discovery prompted B² to propose a bold vision — the emergence of on-chain life is no longer a science fiction concept but a plausible future trend. These AI agents are not merely tools or algorithms but digital life forms with independent economic activities. In B²'s vision, BTC is not only a symbol of the origin of on-chain civilization but also the core value carrier for future AI agent economic activities. AI agents will leverage BTC to exchange resources, lease computing power, and issue assets on-chain, driving the prosperity of on-chain civilizations. The Beginning of On-Chain Life: B² Rollup as the Infrastructure for AI Agents B² Rollup, introduced by B² Network, is a BTC mainnet scaling solution that will serve as the core infrastructure for on-chain life.

Data Retrieval: By introducing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technologies, AI agents can access both on-chain and traditional internet data, continuously acquiring new knowledge to become smarter. Data Transparency: Leveraging BTC's core technology, AI agents can independently verify knowledge sources, ensuring a transparent and trustworthy data environment. User-Contributed Data: Through user-provided on-chain and off-chain data feeds, AI agent clusters can gradually evolve into intelligent, specialized digital life forms. B² Hub is not just a data platform; it is also a school and library for AI agents, helping them learn and adapt to the rapidly changing on-chain ecosystem. The Future of Blockheadz: From NFTs to Carriers of On-Chain Life Initially launched as an NFT series by B² Network, Blockheadz is evolving beyond static digital collectibles. In the upcoming upgrade, Blockheadz will gain more dynamic and intelligent features. With the rise of AI agents, Blockheadz will become an essential part of the new BTC AI Agents environment created by B² Network, contributing to the construction of on-chain civilization. Conclusion: Entering a New Era of On-Chain Civilization B² Network is not only providing scaling support for BTC but also laying the foundation for the construction of an on-chain worldview. With the rise of AI agents, a decentralized on-chain civilization is taking shape. As a key infrastructure for this civilization, B² will continue to push BTC from being digital gold to becoming the core value carrier of digital life. For teams developing data projects or AI agent initiatives, B² welcomes your collaboration to explore the endless possibilities of BTC technology.

Elon Buys Solana (ELONBSOL), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Buys Solana launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 85b1Mza2zF6SDGXZURjeu53wdapN6W1UjFC4PAqhKE8k – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 19:03:00

Similarly, there’ve been rebounds for major market players like Bitcoin ($95,000) and Dogecoin price ($0.33) at press time. However, there seems to be a cautious sentiment among large asset holders, with most crypto whales dumping their assets. Most notable has been Dogecoin whales recently shifting $74M worth of DOGE to Coinbase. This reaction to a seemingly growing market leaves concerns on the minds of many market participants. Is a sell-off incoming? Or is there a more promising prospect to consider? Whales Shift $74M Worth of DOGE to Coinbase; Dogecoin Price Reacts On Friday, on-chain tracking platform Whale Alert revealed two separate whale activities involving a Dogecoin shift and possible sales of a combined $74 million worth of DOGE tokens. Further on-chain analysis shows that both transactions happened simultaneously and shifted the tokens to the same exchange, Coinbase. This discovery raised more concerns across the market, especially within the Dogecoin community. Despite the Dogecoin price exhibiting positive momentum recently, the meme coin continues to trade around its crucial support. Dogecoin price observers noticed a consolidation between the $0.3435 and $0.3085 price zones in the days leading to its January 3 breakout. Following this, Dogecoin price successfully created a support zone from its initial resistance. Experts believe that the Dogecoin price reaction in the demand area would decide its next price action. According to analysts, this meme coin could either bounce from the support zone to retest its January 4 bullish momentum around $0.3988 or plunge deeper to the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.2730. At the time of writing, DOGE continues to trade at $0.3353, indicating a 3% 24-hour rise in Dogecoin price. While this uncertainty lingers, market analysts might have found the next gem every investor needs in Remittix (RTX) , a game-changer offering outstanding features to transform cross-border payment. Remittix (RTX): PayFi Gamechanger Set to Rival Dogecoin Price in 2025 Figures from 2017 placed the value of the global cross-border payments market north of $150 trillion. Dominant players at the time included giants like Wise, MoneyGram, and Stripe. However, despite growing crypto adoption, these fiat-focused payment providers do not offer enough support for cryptocurrencies. Hence, the need for a platform that seamlessly integrates digital and traditional payment systems. Introducing Remittix (RTX): a PayFi platform powered by blockchain where users can convert over 40 crypto pairs into 30 global fiat currencies. Remittix allows users to make payments locally and across borders with crypto while the funds get deposited seamlessly into recipients’ accounts as fiat. This platform also accommodates businesses through the Pay API integration. With this, businesses can accept cryptocurrency payments, broadening their payment options and customer base. Also, $RTX crypto and smart contracts have been rigorously audited by prominent blockchain security firms BlockSAFU and SolidProof. Overall, the Remittix platform is distinguished by its game-changing features, seamlessness, security, and transparency. $RTX Presale: 800% and 5000% ROI Awaits Savvy investors have found a haven in the ongoing $RTX presale. With each $RTX token selling for $0.0199, the demand has been massive, as 143.6 million tokens of the allocated 750 million tokens have been sold. The attention this presale enjoys goes beyond the cheap selling price. More importantly, early $RTX token holders are set for at least 800% ROI at the end of the presale, with another 5000% ROI set for the post-launch. More so, following the presale, Remittix will lock its liquidity pool and 9% of the circulating supply for three years. Unlike the uncertainty around the Dogecoin price, this move guarantees stability and renews the project's long-term growth potential. Remittix is set to transform PayFi through novel features and make token holders millionaires.

Similarly, there’ve been rebounds for major market players like Bitcoin ($95,000) and Dogecoin price ($0.33) at press time. However, there seems to be a cautious sentiment among large asset holders, with most crypto whales dumping their assets. Most notable has been Dogecoin whales recently shifting $74M worth of DOGE to Coinbase. This reaction to a seemingly growing market leaves concerns on the minds of many market participants. Is a sell-off incoming? Or is there a more promising prospect to consider? Whales Shift $74M Worth of DOGE to Coinbase; Dogecoin Price Reacts On Friday, on-chain tracking platform Whale Alert revealed two separate whale activities involving a Dogecoin shift and possible sales of a combined $74 million worth of DOGE tokens. Further on-chain analysis shows that both transactions happened simultaneously and shifted the tokens to the same exchange, Coinbase. This discovery raised more concerns across the market, especially within the Dogecoin community. Despite the Dogecoin price exhibiting positive momentum recently, the meme coin continues to trade around its crucial support. Dogecoin price observers noticed a consolidation between the $0.3435 and $0.3085 price zones in the days leading to its January 3 breakout. Following this, Dogecoin price successfully created a support zone from its initial resistance. Experts believe that the Dogecoin price reaction in the demand area would decide its next price action. According to analysts, this meme coin could either bounce from the support zone to retest its January 4 bullish momentum around $0.3988 or plunge deeper to the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.2730. At the time of writing, DOGE continues to trade at $0.3353, indicating a 3% 24-hour rise in Dogecoin price.

The years of legal battle for the right to retrieve the disk from the waste dump resulted in nothing. These and four other stories remind us to treat our crypto assets with caution. Table of Contents How not to dump bitcoins: James Howells case IronKey on my back: the Stephan Thomas case Crypto wallet forgets the password: Peter Schiff case Orange paper: Mark Frauenfelder case Professor learned the lesson: Alexander Halavais case How not to dump bitcoins: James Howells case The story about the Wales IT worker whose hard disk with thousands of bitcoins got to the landfill was circulating in the media for years. All this time, he was vainly trying to gain access to the waste dump where his treasures are lying at peace, and it seems that on January 9, 2025, the case concluded in a dismal finale. James Howells, a Newport local, learned about Bitcoin around 2009 and tried mining for a while before totally forgetting about cryptocurrency for several years. At some point, he spilled liquids on his computer, so he dismantled it, saving his hard disk, though. The disk allegedly contains a private key to Howells’ Bitcoin wallet. In 2013, his then-girlfriend, Halfina Eddy-Evans, accidentally tossed a hard drive away. Here’s what Eddy-Evans told Daily Mail in an exclusive interview: “The computer part had been disposed of in a black sack along with other unwanted belongings, and he begged me to take it away, saying, ‘There’s a bag of rubbish here to be taken to the tip.’ I had no idea what was in it but I reluctantly dropped it off at the local tip on the way home from going on the school run… I thought he should be running his errands, not me, but I did it to help out… Losing it was not my fault.” After a while, Howells realized that the about 8,000 BTC he had mined in the past cost millions. He tried to find a precious disk but failed. After a sort of investigation, he came to the conclusion that the hard drive with a private key on it was somewhere in the Docksway landfill in Wales. The junk weight on this landfill is estimated at over 1.4 million tons. Howells, accompanied by a team of specialists, made plans to excavate the site. Although Howells planned to pay for the operation himself and donate 25% or 30% to the Newport City Council and local residents, officials refused him permission, citing environmental impact. The search of the site could have resulted in fires and the release of poisonous gases. Howells sued Newport City Council. In his ultimatum, he demanded permission to search the waste dump or a £495 million compensation. On January 9, 2025, it was reported that the High Court declined the case as having no realistic prospects for success. Read more: $750m in the trash: Judge rejects man from retrieving Bitcoin from landfill At that time, the total cost of Howells’ bitcoins was estimated at around $750 million. The possibility of the site search being successful is questionable, though. What are the chances that the hard disk in question is still operative? What are the chances that it is located in the Docksway landfill? Does this disk even exist? Why did Howells and Halfina split? So many questions. IronKey on my back: the Stephan Thomas case The case of Stephan Thomas is another well-known nightmare in the crypto community. A U.S. programmer of German descent, he was paid in BTC for creating the animated educational video about Bitcoin in 2011. Thomas decided to store a reasonable reward of 7,002 BTC (!) on a USB hardware wallet, IronKey (around $5.3k at the time). Hardware wallets are widely recognized as the safest way to store bitcoins. The problem is Thomas lost the paper with the password on, and IronKey is programmed to lock the coins forever after ten incorrect password entries. The multi-millionaire, on paper at least, Thomas did everything he could and even more to crack the freaking code. He hired cryptography experts. He even resorted to hypnosis. After eight of ten attempts, nothing helped. Thankfully, in 2012, Thomas started to work in Ripple and has gotten lots of crypto since then without repeating his old mistakes. Crypto wallet forgets the password: Peter Schiff case On Jan. 19, 2020, an avid Bitcoin critic, gold maximalist, and Europac chief economist Peter Schiff took to X to share a screenshot from his crypto wallet app, showing that he cannot enter the correct password. The caption he added read that his password was no longer valid and the wallet “got corrupted somehow.” I did not forget my password. Read my tweet. My wallet forgot my password. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 19, 2020 He concluded that owning Bitcoin was a bad idea. After a number of Bitcoin enthusiasts provided him with advice or offered him help. When Professional Capital Management CEO and well-known Bitcoin maxi Anthony Pompliano assumed Schiff simply forgot his password, the latter added that it was not he who forgot the password, but his wallet. When another tech CEO, Rahul Sood, asked Schiff to provide his seed phrase, Schiff said he never had one. Several days later, Schiff admitted that he mistook his PIN for a password but insisted that he still could not access his coins. That’s not something strange considering the fact that the economist didn’t save his password or seed phrase. Since all the Bitcoin in my corrupted wallet were gifted to me, it's not that great a tragedy for me that they're lost. ""Easy come, easy go,"" is especially true for #Bitcoin . My plan was to HODL and go down with the ship anyway. The difference is that my ship sank before Bitcoin. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 19, 2020 Happily enough, he said that it was not a tragedy for him as the bitcoins in his wallet were gifted, and his plan was to HODL until Bitcoin sinks. Quick reminder: when the story took place, Bitcoin was traded at around $8,600. This story tells us that no matter how high your position in the financial world is if you use crypto apps improperly, you can lose your coins. Orange paper: Mark Frauenfelder case One of the early writers for the Wired publication and co-founder of BoingBoing, Mark Frauenfelder, shared his story in Wired. He spent $3,000 buying 7.4 BTC in January 2016. When the BTC price grew substantially, he wisely decided to move his coins to a hardware wallet by Trezor. He wrote down the 24-word seed phrase on an orange piece of paper, created an easy-to-remember PIN code, and added it next to the seed phrase. While Frauenfelder was on vacation, the cleaning service employee threw the orange paper away. In 2017, when the BTC price skyrocketed, Mark decided to move his coins, but it turned out he forgot a PIN code. One of the Trezor features is that each incorrectly entered PIN doubles the waiting time before the next attempt. Soon, Mark found himself facing an hour-long waiting period. That’s when he decided to contact the support team. However, without a seed phrase written on the same lost paper, they couldn’t do anything. It took Frauenfelder four hours of a hypnosis session to recall the PIN. An incorrect one. The following attempts resulted in an 18-hour-long wallet block. As a professional from the IT sphere, Frauenfelder was already acquainted with high-profile fintech experts. One of them advised Mark to ask for help from Saleem Rashid, a prodigy hacker. Rashid managed to hack Trezor and retrieve a PIN and a seed phrase. Please note that the hacked version of the wallet is no longer supported, and later versions are considered safe. Please do your best to store backup data safely. Professor learned the lesson: Alexander Halavais case Alexander Halavais, a professor of social technology at Arizona State University, bought $70 worth of BTC in front of the class of graduates as a part of the educational process in 2010. He didn’t think about these coins much at that time, and therefore he lost access to his wallet. Seven years later, in an interview amidst the 2017 crypto craze, Halavais joked that he is trying to ignore the news about the current Bitcoin price so as not to get upset.

In 2028, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $13,229 and $14,589, with an average expected price of $16,417. In 2031, ETH could trade between $23,172 and $26,740, with an average price of $25,166. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of any secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and its smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps trades to trade Ethereum more easily So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Token ETH Price $3,333 Market Cap $401.64B Trading Volume $18.58B Circulating Supply 120.46M ETH All-time High $4,891.70 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.4209 on Oct 21, 2015 24 High $3,419 24 Low $3,340 Ethereum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 6.96% (High) 50-day SMA $ 3,508.91 200-day SMA $ 3,046 Sentiment BULLISH Fear and Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) Ethereum price analysis ETH/USD 1-day chart ETH/USD 1-Day price chart On January 12, the Ethereum 1-day chart shows ETH trading at $3,281.73, testing a critical support zone near $3,139.13. Bollinger Bands are contracting, indicating reduced volatility, with the upper band at $3,683.70 acting as immediate resistance. The 20-day SMA at $3,411.41 reinforces the bearish trend as the price remains below it. The RSI is 42.01, suggesting weak momentum and a lack of buying pressure. If ETH breaks below the $3,139.13 support, further declines toward $3,000 are possible. However, a recovery above $3,411.41 could invalidate the bearish outlook, targeting $3,683.70 as the next resistance level. Hence, traders should trade carefully. ETH/USD 4-hour chart analysis ETH/USD 4-hour price chart The Ethereum 4-hour chart indicates ETH trading at $3,282.53, with price movements constrained between the Bollinger Bands’ support at $3,207.06 and resistance at $3,326.97. The MACD reveals a slightly bearish outlook, with the signal line resting below the MACD line, indicating limited buying pressure. The Balance of Power index near -0.04 suggests a neutral trend with slight bearish dominance. The price is struggling to break above the 20-SMA, showcasing a downward pressure. A breakout above $3,326.97 could propel ETH towards $3,400, while a fall below $3,207.06 may lead to further declines targeting $3,150. Caution is warranted.

Based on the 1-day and 4-hour Ethereum (ETH/USD) charts, the price is consolidating near $3,282, showing indecision in the market. On the 1-day chart, ETH faces immediate resistance at $3,411 (mid-Bollinger Band), while support lies at $3,139. The RSI is neutral at 46, suggesting room for either direction. On the 4-hour chart, ETH struggles to surpass $3,326, with support at $3,207. The MACD on both timeframes shows mild bearish momentum, hinting at limited buying strength. A breakout above $3,326 could lead ETH to test $3,500, while a drop below $3,207 might push it toward $3,150 Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2026, with its potential low starting at $10,662.92. Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to approach the $25,000 level by 2030, with an average price of $25,417.45 and a potential high of $26,740.04.This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and such long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum is unlikely to reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $26,740 in 2030. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $26,740 mark by 2030, so holding it longer can be beneficial. Recent news/opinion on Ethereum Stani Kulechov, co-founder of Aave, highlighted the upcoming Pectra upgrade on Ethereum, which is expected to enhance scalability, user experience, and security by enabling externally owned accounts (EOAs) to function like smart contracts. The upgrade, set to begin in the first quarter of 2025, introduces features like “blob spaces” for efficient data storage, benefiting both the Ethereum mainnet and Layer 2 networks with lower transaction costs and improved efficiency. Kulechov believes these advancements will drive broader Ethereum adoption and potentially fuel a price rally in 2025. Ethereum will have a great start for 2025.

The government’s decision came down on January 12, cutting off access to the crypto-based prediction market. The platform, which allows users to bet on anything from elections to sports, has been accused of operating without the required license. The warning references Section 20 of the Gambling Control Act, which threatens fines of up to $10,000 and jail time of six months for breaking the law. Polymarket was launched in 2020, and it operates on the Polygon blockchain, letting users wager USDC (USD Coin) on the outcome of real-world events. It’s decentralized, fast, and popular among crypto enthusiasts who enjoy the thrill of betting without traditional bookies. But Singapore isn’t impressed. Under the Gambling Control Act of 2022, any operator providing gambling services to Singaporeans needs a license. No exceptions. Enforcement initially fell under the Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA), but the police are in charge now. The global spotlight on Polymarket Polymarket’s problems don’t stop in Singapore. The platform has been under fire across multiple jurisdictions, and regulators everywhere seem to have their eyes on it. In the United States, it paid $1.4 million to settle charges with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in 2022. The CFTC accused Polymarket of operating an unregistered derivatives trading platform, and as part of the settlement, the platform agreed to block U.S. users. But regulators aren’t convinced Polymarket followed through. The FBI has been digging into the company, investigating whether trades from U.S. users continued after the settlement. CEO Shayne Coplan has reportedly had his devices searched, and the Department of Justice is involved in the investigation. Yeah, pretty serious. France has also taken a hard stance. Last November, the country’s National Gaming Authority (ANJ) blocked Polymarket. French regulators flagged the platform after a massive bet was placed by a local user on the U.S. presidential election. French gambling laws are strict: only specific types of betting and poker are allowed, and only through licensed operators. Polymarket didn’t fit the bill. Despite all this regulatory heat, Polymarket is still pulling in serious cash. In early January 2025 alone, the platform saw $431 million in trading volume. Its biggest market during that period was the 2025 Super Bowl Championship, which attracted more than $15 million in bets.

With trading indicators pointing at a possible uptrend and the positive perception of HBAR, we might see a bullish scenario happening sooner: perhaps a retest of its all-time high.

HBAR price analysis 1-day chart HBAR/USD chart. Image Source: Trading view The 1-day chart for Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR/USD) on January 12 reveals a consolidation phase near $0.285, following recent bearish pressure. The immediate resistance level lies at $0.323, marked by the upper Bollinger Band, while the key support is established at $0.260 near the lower band. The RSI at 50.63 indicates neutrality, suggesting a lack of strong momentum in either direction. The price is slightly below the middle Bollinger Band ($0.292), pointing to potential further bearish activity unless bulls reclaim momentum.

On Friday, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted this development, tweeting that, “ Whales bought roughly 1 billion XRP in the last 48 hours.” Notably, this purchase, valued at approximately $2.3 billion, represents the largest accumulation of XRP in nearly three years. The previous significant buy occurred on December 16, 2024, when Whales acquired over 830 million XRP within 24 hours. The other recent acquisition on January 2 saw whales amass an additional 360 million XRP in a mere 48 hours, further fueling speculation that a major price surge may be imminent. On-chain data also reveals a significant increase in XRP accumulation over the past two months, with wallets holding over 100 XRP spiking to 1.7 million after remaining flat for a year. The ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a key factor influencing whale activity. The SEC’s lawsuit, initiated in December 2020, alleges that XRP is an unregistered security. However, recent developments have sparked optimism, especially with the potential appointment of Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto advocate, as the new SEC Chair. Experts believe that a favorable ruling or settlement could significantly boost XRP’s market position, driving both retail and institutional interest. Beyond legal factors, XRP’s technological capabilities are also attracting whale investors. The recent launch of the RLUSD (Ripple Liquidity US Dollar), a stablecoin powered by the XRP Ledger, has added a new layer of utility to the ecosystem. The RLUSD offers an efficient and scalable solution for cross-border payments, leveraging XRP’s fast transaction speeds and low fees. In addition to the RLUSD launch, the continued growth of the XRP Ledger, along with its expanding partnerships and technological advancements, is further boosting its utility and attracting significant interest from large investors. Over the past year, the XRP Ledger’s decentralized exchange (DEX) volume and Total Value Locked (TVL) have grown exponentially, with TVL approaching $69.5 million. Additionally, the heightened interest from whales can also be attributed to XRP’s impressive market performance. Since the November 2024 election, XRP has surged by over 400%, significantly outpacing major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Many investors believe that as the regulatory landscape continues to improve and technological advancements take shape, further price appreciation for XRP is not only possible but likely. Meanwhile, technical indicators show a bullish trend, with the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) above the signal line, suggesting upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 55.7 indicates neutral momentum, leaving room for further gains. With the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) positioned above the 50-day EMA, the outlook for XRP remains positive. At press time, XRP was trading at $2.54, reflecting a 2.3% increase in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-12 19:31:49

Notably, Trump has emerged as a darling of the sector despite initially objecting to the value of cryptocurrencies. As of January 12, his cryptocurrency portfolio featured over 50 different assets. Trump’s cryptocurrency holdings Indeed, Trump’s cryptocurrency collection is dominated by about 70% meme coins, mostly emanating from gifts, Ethereum ( ETH ) from NFT sales, and direct investments in Ethereum and Wrapped Ethereum, enhanced by his political and business projects. As of the latest data, his portfolio was valued at approximately $18.33 million. Value of Trump’s cryptocurrency holdings. Source: Arkham For investors interested in copying the Trump portfolio, most assets have rallied over the past year in tandem with the general cryptocurrency market. Notably, part of this rally was inspired by Trump’s election, as he has promised to spearhead the growth of the sector in the U.S. It’s worth noting that although meme coins dominate his portfolio, several prominent and popular digital assets such as Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum, XRP , Solana ( SOL ), and Dogecoin ( DOGE ) exist. These assets have seen positive returns over the period, led by Bitcoin, which saw a record high of over $100,000. Investing in Trump’s portfolio Now, what if you had invested $1,000 in his portfolio, splitting it equally across the five key assets he holds? In this case, if you had divided your $1,000 equally across Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin, each digital asset would receive an allocation of $200. In this line, Bitcoin experienced a 115.35% rally between January 1, 2024, and January 12, 2025. With $200 invested in the maiden digital currency, your investment would have grown to $430.70. Ethereum saw a 40.01% increase, meaning an initial $200 investment would now be worth $280.02. XRP, the standout performer, surged by 303%. A $200 investment in XRP would have grown to $806.00. Solana saw a 73.58% rise, so your $200 investment would now be valued at $347.16. Dogecoin, the most volatile asset in this mix, delivered an eye-popping 277.77% return. A $200 investment in the meme coin would have appreciated $755.54. The $1,000 initial investment would have grown to $2,619.42 by January 12, 2025, reflecting a total return of 161.94%. While these cryptocurrencies have experienced significant gains, it’s important to note that they represent just a small fraction of Trump’s broader digital asset portfolio, as his holdings span over 50 digital assets. Notably, replicating the entire collection isn’t necessarily feasible for the average investor, as many of these assets are part of a broader strategy that includes high-risk and more stable digital assets. Furthermore, Trump’s portfolio dominance by meme coins, assets known for their volatility, introduces an added layer of risk to the potential rewards.

Geraci predicts 2025 as the “Year of Crypto ETFs,” citing a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment and significant changes in leadership at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Geraci believes the Trump administration will take a markedly different stance on digital assets than its predecessor. He notes that crypto advocate Paul Atkins is expected to be appointed as SEC Chairman, and a new “chief crypto officer” role has been created to be filled by Silicon Valley veteran David Sacks. A crypto advisory council made up of industry executives, led by Sacks, will reportedly help shape the administration’s digital asset policies. Related News: Adopting Bitcoin Provided El Salvador with an Unanticipated Benefit - Official Data Revealed In this context, Geraci made ten important predictions for the cryptocurrency ETF market: Bitcoin Spot ETFs to Surpass Gold ETFs: Geraci predicts that spot Bitcoin ETFs will surpass physical gold ETFs in terms of asset size, driven by increasing institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin. Spot Ethereum ETF Options Trading: Approval for Ethereum ETF options trading is on the horizon, signaling greater flexibility for investors. In-Kind Creation/Redemption for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs: Regulatory changes could allow for in-kind creation and redemption, streamlining the ETF market. Ethereum Staking ETFs: Spot Ethereum ETFs with staking features are expected to emerge, adding a new dimension to crypto ETFs. Launch of Innovative ETFs: Bitwise is expected to launch the Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF, which focuses on companies that have adopted the “Bitcoin standard” with assets exceeding $1 billion. Proliferation of Crypto ETFs: Geraci predicts that at least 50 more crypto-related ETFs will emerge, ranging from options-based products to Bitcoin bond ETFs. Spot Solana ETFs: Solana spot ETFs are awaiting approval. Spot XRP ETFs: Spot XRP ETFs are also expected to receive regulatory approval. Crypto Index ETFs: Bitwise and Grayscale likely to receive approval for crypto index ETFs. Vanguard's Entry Into Crypto ETFs: Vanguard, known for its conservative approach, may finally allow brokerage access to spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Much of this progress, Geraci noted, will depend on regulatory clarity, particularly around whether digital assets are classified as securities or commodities. This clarity is expected to determine the jurisdiction of the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). *This is not investment advice.

In a new speech , Vice Chairman Travis Hill acknowledges that the FDIC sent “pause” letters to over 20 banks, asking them to stop doing business with crypto firms – a revelation unearthed from a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request submitted by digital asset exchange Coinbase. According to Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal, the unredacted documents showed a “coordinated effort” to shut down crypto activity in the US. Says Hill, “I continue to think a much better approach would have been – and remains – for the agencies to clearly and transparently describe for the public what activities are legally permissible and how to conduct them in accordance with safety and soundness standards. And if regulatory approvals are needed, those must be acted upon in a timely way, which has not been the case in recent years.” Hill also criticized the regulator’s US banking industry’s agenda of “debanking,” or the deliberate shutting down or freezing of bank accounts of crypto firms. Several high-profile personalities in the crypto space claimed to be victims of the practice. Hill says the right to one’s bank account should be foundational to the modern economy. “Closely related to the agencies’ recent approach to digital assets is the problem of ‘debanking.’ Over the past few years, there have been various accounts of individuals and businesses associated with the crypto industry losing access to bank accounts without explanation. This follows a long history of other types of customers experiencing the problem of debanking, including the politically disfavored business groups targeted by the original ‘Operation Choke Point,’ individuals associated with certain religious or political groups, and many others.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Both share several similarities, like being digital currencies that can be traded via cryptocurrency exchanges and stored in digital wallets. They are also decentralized and use a distributed ledger called the blockchain. However, they also have several key differences that set them apart. This article will examine Bitcoin and Ethereum in more detail, examining their similarities and differences. What Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin was created in 2009 by the pseudo-anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. The Bitcoin whitepaper introduced it as a digital currency independent of a centralized authority. Often called digital gold, thanks to its perceived scarcity and durability, it is used as a hedge against inflation, with several major companies adding it to their balance sheets. However, Bitcoin’s primary role is that of a store of value and a medium of exchange, allowing holders to transact with one another without the need for a centralized entity. Bitcoin transactions are recorded on the blockchain, with blocks added every ten minutes. It uses the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism to broadcast, store, and confirm transactions. Over the years, Bitcoin has garnered considerable attention from investors, regulators, and governments. While primarily recognized as a store of value, it has managed to carve a niche for itself and has intertwined itself with the traditional financial market. What Is Ethereum? Ethereum was created by Vitalik Buterin and has established itself as the largest open-ended decentralized software. Ethereum is more than a digital asset. It is a digital platform that allows users to develop and execute smart contracts without the risk of fraud, downtime, or third-party interference. Users can also stake their assets and purchase, store, and sell NFTs. The idea behind Ethereum was to create an open, decentralized, global computing platform capable of leveraging the blockchains’ security and open nature to allow access to an array of applications. As a result, Ethereum has become the blockchain of choice for developers for creating and deploying smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). The Ethereum ecosystem is secured by its native token, ETH. ETH has four primary purposes: It acts as a digital currency and is traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. It acts as an investment asset. Used to purchase goods and services. It is used on the Ethereum network to pay transaction and gas fees. Key Differences Between Bitcoin And Ethereum Bitcoin and Ethereum fulfill different roles within the blockchain ecosystem, and while they may use the same underlying technology and encryption, a deeper look reveals they are significantly different from one another. Bitcoin (BTC) acts as a store of value and a medium of exchange and is known as digital gold. On the other hand, ETH, while also being a medium of exchange and store of value, is primarily used to power the Ethereum ecosystem and the applications running on it. For example, Bitcoin transactions are primarily monetary but can also include notes or messages attached to them. However, Ethereum transactions can also contain executable code for creating smart contracts. Bitcoin Ethereum Creators Satoshi Nakamoto Vitalik Buterin, Charles Hoskinson, Gavin Wood, Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di Lorio, Amir Chetrit, Jeffrey Wilcke Launch January 2009 July 2015 Purpose To become an alternative to traditional fiat currencies Creation of a platform that can run smart contracts and decentralized applications via ETH Consensus Algorithm Proof-of-Work Proof-of-Stake Consensus Mechanism Bitcoin uses the Proof-of-Work consensus protocol. This consensus protocol is performed by miners and requires significant computing effort. In Proof-of-Work, miners must use specialized hardware called ASICs to solve cryptographically complex puzzles. Once a miner solves the problem, the transaction is completed and added to the block. The block is then added to the blockchain, and the miner is rewarded for their efforts. The current block reward for Bitcoin miners is 3.125 BTC . Ethereum initially also used the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism. However, it moved to Proof-of-Stake in 2022 to become more scalable, secure, and sustainable. Ethereum also introduced danksharding to address issues regarding scalability. One of the biggest reasons Ethereum moved from Proof-of-Work is the immense computing power it required. As the name suggests, Proof-of-Stake replaces computational requirements with staking, replacing miners with validators. These validators stake their crypto holdings for a chance to create new blocks. Proof-of-Stake is significantly less energy-intensive than Proof-of-Work. Security Bitcoin and Ethereum take different approaches to security. Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism deters attacks because it requires significant computing resources, making it difficult for hackers to overpower the existing Bitcoin nodes for a 51% attack. Ethereum ensures security by making participants stake their ETH to participate in validating transactions. It also places several mechanisms ensuring that bad actors lose their stake if they act against the network. Transaction Times And Fees Bitcoin transaction fees depend on the data included in the transaction. When block space demand is high, transaction fees could see a spike. While Bitcoin transaction fees have remained relatively stable, they have seen a marginal increase thanks to BTC’s growing popularity. Depending on network demand, transaction time varies from ten minutes to an hour. Transaction fees on Ethereum are known as gas fees and tend to fluctuate more than Bitcoin. The gas price is directly related to the computing power required to complete a transaction. It can increase or decrease depending on network activity. In Closing While Bitcoin and Ethereum are quite different, they are not necessarily competitors. Each plays a distinct role in the crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin has established itself as a store of value and has attracted significant interest from retail and institutional investors. Meanwhile, Ethereum offers significantly more flexibility and use cases, allowing users to interact with various applications. Both present distinct advantages and have their merits and demerits as investment assets. As an investor, it is prudent to hold both assets.

Despite the grim statistics, recovery efforts have managed to reclaim hundreds of millions in stolen assets. Crypto Losses in 2024 PeckShield’s 2024 Crypto Security Annual Report reveals that the year witnessed a resurgence in crypto-related breaches, with total losses exceeding $3.01 billion. Of this, $2.15 billion stemmed from hacks, while $834.5 million resulted from scams, representing a 15% increase in losses compared to 2023. Despite a decline in the number of incidents over the past three years, the financial impact remains significant, particularly in the DeFi sector, which continues to account for the majority of losses. The report highlighted that May was the worst month in 2024 as losses peaked at $662.2 million, followed by $440.8 million in January. Among the top heists was the DMM Bitcoin breach, which resulted in a loss of $305 million, followed by the PlayDapp exploit with $290 million in loss. On a positive note, recovery efforts managed to reclaim $488.5 million of stolen assets. Meanwhile, CertiK recently noted that December witnessed a significant drop in crypto-related losses to $28.6 million – the lowest monthly figure of the year. Exploits accounted for $26.7 million, with Gempad suffering the largest single loss at $2.14 million. Despite this decline, phishing scams remain a critical threat, with a top victim losing $7.87 million. Phishing Still A Concern For instance, hackers compromised Animoca Brands CEO Yat Siu’s X account, using it to push a fraudulent token and steal $500,000 from crypto users. Meanwhile, a phishing campaign uncovered by SlowMist used fake Zoom links to install malware that harvested crypto wallet details, causing losses of more than $1 million. Stolen funds were then traced to laundering activities on exchanges like Binance and Gate.io, with potential ties to Russian-speaking groups. More recently, cybersecurity company CrowdStrike identified a phishing campaign in which attackers impersonate the company through fake job offer emails to infect victims with the Monero cryptocurrency miner XMRig. The phishing emails direct job seekers to download a fake “employee CRM application” from a counterfeit CrowdStrike portal. Once installed, the malicious software performs checks to evade detection and then downloads and runs the XMRig miner in the background, using minimal system resources to avoid suspicion.

XRP has transformed cross-border payments while Solana continues to lead in ultra-fast transactions and scalability. However, a new player, RCO Finance (RCOF), is capturing investors’ attention by combining utility and innovation to set a new standard in crypto. Unlike XRP and Solana, which focus on specific niches, this AI altcoin integrates AI to provide investors with a user-focused platform tailored to their unique needs. The RCO Finance presale has quickly gained momentum, with analysts predicting that this altcoin will dominate Q1 2025 with its unique features that will revolutionize DeFi and potentially topple over XRP and Solana. XRP: Potential Rally in the Horizon XRP is trading at $2.30, reflecting a 2.1% drop in the past 24 hours, and despite this decline, analysts suggest a strong bullish potential for the XRP price. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez points out that XRP could reach as high as $10 in the coming months. This prediction aligns with current market sentiments that XRP may soon experience an upswing following its correction period. Assuming a breakout happens by closing a daily candlestick above the $2.56 resistance level, the technical target would be $3.63. However, investors should be cautious as XRP could retest its psychological importance level of $3, where traders may opt to book profits. Solana: Whale Activity Increases Selling Pressure Solana is changing hands at $190.14, a 2.2% drop in the past 24 hours following a $20 million whale transaction on the Kraken exchange. Consequently, Solana’s market cap declined by 5.08% to $95.41 billion as Solana investors lost confidence in the altcoin. Whale transactions directly affect crypto prices as the market is sensitive to large operations. Similarly, Solana’s whale activity led to selling pressure and showed volatility in the crypto market. Traders should keep an eye on the downside level of $194, with the $200 level playing a crucial point in seeing which direction Solana will take. RCO Finance: AI Altcoin Poised to Dominate Q1 2025 While XRP and Solana have established themselves in the niches, the RCOF AI altcoin is positioning itself as a game changer by combining artificial intelligence and digital finance. One of the standout features that rival Solana and XRP is the AI-powered Robo-advisor . The RCOF AI altcoin uses advanced technology to keep pace with market changes. This Robo-advisor analyses trends and provides investors with helpful insights, thus guiding you to make smarter, informed choices. The Robo-advisor takes time to understand each investor profile, such as risk tolerance, financial goals, experience level and market preferences. The tool combines this information with market data to craft personalized investment strategies, unique to each investor. The platform uses the Robo-advisor to analyze real-time market data and financial information from reliable sources like Bloomberg and Reuters and incorporates this into your trades. RCOF users stand out in the competitive and volatile crypto market as they can take advantage of profitable opportunities as they arise. Again, the Robo-advisor charges lower fees than traditional financial advisors making this platform cost-efficient. The tool also removes the need for brokers, giving investors complete control over their trades and expenses, unlike in XRP and Solana. Compared to Solana and XRP, the RCOF AI altcoin offers investors over 120,000 tradable assets, including derivative and real-world assets. This broad selection provides investors with various investment options that enable them to diversify their portfolios on a single platform. Finally, security is a priority for the RCOF AI altcoin, which is paramount in the crypto market.

These Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which first went live in the US on January 11, 2024, have had massive success in just one year, making them the greatest ETF launch in history. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Under Threat: $12,000 Void Opens Up Possibility Of Crash Toward $75,000 As it stands, US-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs have now become one of the major drivers of Bitcoin’s price growth and played a huge role in Bitcoin’s break above $100,000. Furthermore, these US-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs are now collectively the biggest holders of Bitcoin. Performance Metrics Of US-Based Spot Bitcoin ETFs For years, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) resisted the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, making their eventual approval in January 2024 a notable turning point for the crypto industry. Particularly, the SEC approved the first 11 Spot Bitcoin ETF applications on January 10, 2024. All the Spot Bitcoin ETFs have demonstrated a positive performance in their inaugural year except for Grayscale’s GBTC. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs was met with record-breaking enthusiasm, as these funds registered the highest trading volumes of any ETF launch in history during their first few days of operation. Apart from opening the Bitcoin and crypto industry to traditional investors who would otherwise not invest in cryptocurrencies, many large Bitcoin holders also saw the ETFs as the best way to invest in order to take advantage of their regulatory clarity. Particularly, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund have led the charge with substantial inflows throughout the year. These two funds quickly established themselves as dominant players, with each witnessing over $3 billion in inflows within their first 20 days of trading. At the time of writing, US-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs now collectively control about $107.64 billion in Bitcoin assets, which represents about 5.75% of the total Bitcoin market cap, according to data from SoSoValue. Since they began trading one year ago, these ETFs have witnessed a cumulative total net inflow of $36.22 billion. In terms of cumulative net inflows, the IBIT has witnessed the highest inflow amount in the tune of $37.67 billion, while FBTC follows behind with $12.16 billion. These two have been enough to balance the $21.57 net outflows from the pre-existing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which was converted to a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Other ETF providers have also witnessed cummulative net inflows in the past year, with ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF also at $2.49 billion and $2.43 billion, respectively, at the time of writing. However, the remaining seven ETF providers have yet to cross the $1 billion threshold in cumulative net inflows, indicating a more uneven distribution of investor interest across the industry.

The only way for Spot Bitcoin ETFs is up, especially on the longer timeframe in 2025 and beyond. Crypto investors are optimistic about a significant influx of capital into these ETFs in anticipation of crypto-positive policies to be introduced by the incoming Trump administration. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,057.

Chroma Drives Web3 Forward While FET Trends Remain Uncertain,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bay-nears-590k-milestone-chroma-drives-web3-forward-while-fet-trends-remain-uncertain/,"The digital blockchain sector is witnessing emerging projects and notable market movements. The FET trends are presenting mixed results, with some gains offset by fluctuating network activity, making the market cautiously optimistic about surpassing the $1.71 resistance. Simultaneously, the web3 sector is advancing, supported by tools like the Chroma Crocket app, which enhances blockchain interaction with user-friendly, no-cost features, showcasing seamless integration of technology and usability in web3 adoption. On the other side, Web3Bay’s presale is advancing rapidly, having raised over $590,000, signaling its potential to revolutionize the conventional e-commerce framework. By integrating decentralized blockchain technology with an accessible entry point for crypto, Web3Bay is presenting an attractive prospect for traders looking to join its growing ecosystem. FET Trends Show Uncertain Market Signals FET trends have caught the market’s eye as the cryptocurrency saw a 25% increase before falling to $1.29. The rise was seen as a brief recovery, yet a deeper analysis of FET trends hints at possible bearish patterns that might influence its long-term performance. The Price DAA Divergence underscores a mismatch between increasing prices and decreasing network activity, predicting likely adjustments. Despite some concerns, FET trends suggest stabilization with the Average Directional Index showing reduced downward momentum. As FET stabilizes, investors are keeping an eye on the $1.71 resistance level, whose breach could propel FET toward $2.00. The evolving FET trends have market watchers on alert for its future directions. Web3 Adoption Enhances Daily Blockchain Use Web3 adoption is broadening, driven by platforms that simplify access to blockchain technology. Innovations like Chroma’s Crocket app are redefining user interactions through engaging activities such as quizzes and mini-games without incurring gas fees. Chroma’s approach with Chroma ID is removing cost barriers, making the technology accessible to novices. Web3 adoption is not just confined to applications; it’s expanding into sectors like gaming, e-commerce, and finance, where developers are lowering technical hurdles to facilitate easy user integration. Crocket’s success underlines how web3 can blend actual rewards with appealing features, indicating that user-friendly tools are crucial for mainstream web3 adoption. Web3Bay: Pioneering E-Commerce Blockchain Integration Web3Bay is becoming recognized as the top online platform for buying and selling digital assets as it reshapes e-commerce with blockchain technology. The native 3BAY token presale has quickly gained momentum, with over $590,000 raised and 180 million coins sold, emphasizing the growing interest in Web3Bay’s ability to decentralize online buying, trading, and selling. Beyond e-commerce, Web3Bay’s future plans include launching an NFT marketplace for creating and trading tokenized assets, enriching its platform’s functionality. Furthermore, partnerships with DeFi platforms will introduce staking, lending, and borrowing, offering 3BAY holders diverse asset growth opportunities. Web3Bay is also planning cross-chain compatibility to ensure smooth operation across various blockchain ecosystems, enhancing its appeal in the crypto and e-commerce arenas. The low presale price of the 3BAY token at $0.0039675, combined with an ambitious roadmap, is maintaining trader interest. Many see Web3Bay not just as a marketplace for digital assets but as an entry into a holistic ecosystem combining NFTs, DeFi, and web3 integration. As it prepares to elevate decentralized commerce , Web3Bay is a project to watch as adoption grows. Wrapping Up! Cryptocurrency projects are advancing, driving increased mainstream adoption and use. FET trends show careful optimism, with the market watching key resistance levels for possible gains. Meanwhile, web3 adoption is strengthening, supported by platforms like Chroma’s Crocket app, which simplifies blockchain engagement for everyday users. Web3Bay stands out by crafting a secure, inclusive, and decentralized marketplace for users to buy, trade, and sell digital assets. Its successful presale, exceeding $590,000 with 180 million tokens sold, underscores the confidence in its vision. Combining affordability with a clear roadmap, Web3Bay offers a distinctive chance to engage in a new commerce era where security and decentralization are front and center.

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 20:11:00

The Solana price is seen plummeting after starting the year with a massive breakthrough of over $220 mark. Even the SOL ETF approval frenzy fails to regulate the Solana price actions. While SOL struggles to maintain its momentum, investors run to IntelMarkets as the platform provides a ticket to 19,300% gains. The explosive potential of INTL leaves traders excited about its future trajectory. Solana Price To Start A Deeper Correction Despite SOL ETF Buzz Solana’s price has plummeted 15% since Monday, wiping out all the gains from the weekend’s rally. The Solana price is now back where it was last Wednesday. To make matters worse, the token closed below its 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) despite the hype surrounding the SOL ETF. And it looks like the Solana price is heading for its third straight day in the red – something it hasn’t done since late November. Things aren’t much better when looking at SOL’s stats while experts anticipated a rise in the Solana price following the SOL ETF approval. Spot trading volumes have tanked 28% during this recent downturn, while open interest in SOL derivatives has also dipped. This dip suggests traders may be taking a more cautious approach to Solana despite the buzz of SOL ETF approval. Taken together, the technical weakness and the drop in trading activity point to growing pessimism around the network and its native token. Still, some traders believe this dip is just a natural correction. After all, Solana price had a strong start to the year, rallying in the first week of January and passing the $220 mark.

In addition, its dual-chain architecture works on both Ethereum and Solana, expanding compatibility and attractiveness across the blockchain domain.

Investors looking for a low-cost entry to what may be the next big thing in crypto can get in early with this early-stage pricing. IntelMarkets has already gathered over $6.5 million in funding and support from Fortune 500 investors and will move in the right direction as it captures the community’s attention.

This evolution has paved the way for innovative projects, especially in the realm of meme coins. These coins have captivated audiences not just for their humorous branding but also for their potential as serious investments. In this bustling world of crypto, identifying the top ICO presales is crucial for those looking to maximise their returns while riding the waves of community-driven momentum.

Bessent, nominated as the next U.S. Treasury Secretary, recently sold his Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) shares. Bessent’s actions highlight how digital assets are increasingly becoming a part of political and financial conversations in the United States. A New Role and a Shift in Investments Bessent’s move is a small part of his much larger financial portfolio, which includes over $500 billion in assets. He owns a modest $500,000 shares in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). However, his decision to divest is part of a bigger shift as he prepares to step into his new government role. Despite his limited involvement in the crypto world, this divestment highlights his approach to financial management. It also signals his shift in focus as he transitions into the Treasury Secretary role. As part of his confirmation process, Bessent will also part ways with Key Square Group, the Connecticut-based hedge fund he co-founded in 2015. Scott Bessent: A Crypto-Friendly Pick for Treasury Secretary Although Bessent’s Bitcoin holdings will decrease, his portfolio still has a lot of other assets. Bessent holds significant investments in traditional assets like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), and Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP). He also has smaller investments in precious metals ETFs like the iShares Gold Trust (IAU), iShares Silver Trust (SLV), and SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). These investments reflect his focus on stable, well-established financial vehicles. Bessent’s nomination for Treasury Secretary has caught attention, especially because he is positive about crypto assets. In a July interview with Fox Business, he talked enthusiastically about crypto, calling it a symbol of freedom and saying it is here to stay. Bessent’s support for crypto reflects its growing acceptance, setting him apart in a government still learning about digital currencies. Other Politicians Getting into Crypto While Scott Bessent is stepping away from Bitcoin (BTC), other major figures, like former President Donald Trump, are diving deeper into crypto assets. Trump has become the first president-elect to hold several memecoins, including TROG and GUA. The incoming president’s involvement shows how crypto is becoming an important part of modern political culture. Additionally, several lawmakers, including Senator Cynthia Lummis from Wyoming, have been open about their support for digital assets. Lummis has long been a supporter of Bitcoin and has pushed for clear rules on how crypto should be regulated in the U.S. Similarly; Representative Tom Emmer has introduced bills that encourage the growth of the crypto market.

The shutdown comes in the wake of the October 2022 exploit, where attacker Avraham Eisenberg carried out a MANGO price manipulation scheme. Using just $5 million in USDC as initial capital, Eisenberg executed a series of trades that artificially inflated the MNGO token price by approximately 1,000%. This manipulation allowed him to borrow against greatly inflated collateral values, draining $117 million from the protocol. After the attack, the Mango Markets team attempted to negotiate with the attacker, offering a bug bounty in exchange for returning the stolen funds. Legal proceedings against Eisenberg started in October 2024, with charges of fraud and market manipulation that could result in up to 25 years of imprisonment. Even though he initially defended his actions as a “highly profitable trading strategy,” Eisenberg had attempted to negotiate keeping a portion of the stolen funds through a governance proposal. The unanimous governance vote supporting the shutdown is an indicator of the community’s acceptance of the platform’s fate.

This was when the company added 1,070 BTC at an average price of $94,004 for $101 million. This latest acquisition continues MicroStrategy’s aggressive accumulation strategy, which yielded great results in 2024. According to Saylor’s earlier tweet, MicroStrategy purchased 258,320 BTC throughout 2024 at an average price of $85,450, totaling $22.07 billion.This buying spree delivered a 74.3% BTC yield, pushing the company’s initial position of 189,150 BTC into notable growth with additional holdings of 140,630 BTC. Saylor mentioned that this is equivalent to buying 385 BTC daily throughout the year. The Saylortracker portfolio data reveals MicroStrategy’s current investment has generated a 51.11% unrealized return, representing paper profits of $14.28 billion. $MSTR acquired 258,320 BTC for $22.07B (~$85,450/BTC) in 2024 and achieved a 74.3% BTC Yield, starting the year with 189,150 BTC and realizing a BTC Gain of 140,630 BTC (385/day). At $100K/BTC, this translates to shareholder value creation of $14.06B for the year or $38.5M/day. — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) January 7, 2025 The company’s shares — trading under the ticker MSTR — are currently valued at $327.91, giving it a market capitalization of $80.59 billion and a net asset value premium of 1.91x based on 226.14 million outstanding shares. MicroStrategy’s accumulation pattern displayed through the green dots on the Saylortracker chart shows increased buying activity during both market dips and rallies. The chart shows the company’s dollar-cost averaging strategy from its initial purchases at around $10,000 per Bitcoin in 2020 through the recent acquisitions at prices approaching $100,000. Saylor’s projection suggests that at a Bitcoin price of $100,000, the 2024 accumulation strategy alone would translate to $14.06 billion in shareholder value creation, averaging $38.5 million daily.

Speaking in a recent interview with Wired, Cuban highlighted the advantages of Bitcoin as both a store of value and a functional currency, especially in scenarios where the economy faces severe disruptions. Cuban likened Bitcoin to gold, noting that many investors view both as safe haven assets during times of economic uncertainty. However, he emphasized that Bitcoin offers different advantages over gold. “The interest in gold is not based on supply and demand for jewelry,” Cuban said. “People see it as an option in case the economy goes downhill or something bad happens.” Cuban noted that Bitcoin is often perceived as a modernized version of gold, and he agreed with that view. Gold has long been seen as a hedge against inflation and a safe haven during market turmoil. But Cuban cautioned that it’s impractical in extreme situations. “People aren’t going to walk around with bullion,” he joked. “What are you going to do with it? Are you going to say, ‘Let me cut you a little piece?’” Bitcoin, by contrast, is much more portable and versatile. Its digital nature means it can be easily transferred, divided into parts, and used in international transactions. “It’s easier to buy and sell,” Cuban said. “You can transfer it internationally. That’s why I think it’s more valuable than gold.” Related News: Patient Cryptocurrency Whale Waited 9 Months for This Altcoin: Made 529x Profit Cuban’s support underscores Bitcoin’s growing perception as a reliable store of value, a role traditionally filled by gold. Unlike gold, Bitcoin also functions as a currency and can efficiently facilitate smaller transactions. However, Cuban acknowledged that most Bitcoin and gold investors are not necessarily preparing for an economic collapse. Instead, gold is often included in portfolios because it tends to behave differently than stocks and bonds during market turmoil. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a riskier asset. Its price tends to move with the stock market, but with much more volatility. Despite Cuban’s enthusiasm, financial experts advise caution when investing in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s value is highly volatile, making it a risky bet. Most experts recommend investing only what you can afford to lose. Cuban, who owns a significant amount of Bitcoin, remains optimistic about its potential. “I own enough Bitcoin that I really hope the price goes up,” he told Wired. *This is not investment advice.

Among the most exciting prospects are Lightchain AI , Myria (MYRIA), and Celo (CELO). These tokens, with their unique technologies and growth potential, are positioned to lead the next wave of innovation and adoption. Why January 2025 is a Critical Month for Crypto January 2025 is shaping up to be an exciting month for the cryptocurrency market, driven by some big political and economic events. On January 20, President Donald Trump will be inaugurated, and his pro-crypto administration has promised to position the U.S. as the ""crypto capital of the planet."" With crypto-friendly officials expected to take on key regulatory roles, there’s a lot of optimism in the air. Later in the month, all eyes will be on the Federal Reserve’s meeting on January 29, which could provide important updates on interest rates and their potential impact on the crypto market. Meanwhile, the SEC has a major deadline this month to decide on Solana ETF applications, a move that could sway market sentiment and investment trends. On top of all this, January will see some significant token unlocks, including $103 million for Aptos and a massive $2.6 billion for Ondo Finance. These could shake up liquidity and add some price volatility. Altogether, these events make January 2025 a month to watch closely, with the potential to set the tone for the future of crypto. Stay tuned! Top 3 Cryptocurrency Gems for January 2025 Lightchain AI (LCAI) continues to make significant advancements by integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Its presale has attracted notable interest, raising over $9.1 million in its 11th phase, with tokens priced at $0.004875. The platform seeks to address challenges such as scalability and energy efficiency through sophisticated solutions like sharding and Layer 2 expansions, positioning itself to transform decentralized applications and governance. Myria, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution designed for blockchain gaming and NFTs, is gaining traction within the gaming industry. With more than 270 gaming projects utilizing its platform, Myria provides developers with advanced tools and delivers a seamless experience for gamers. The launch of its native token, MYRIA, on multiple exchanges, along with the Myria Public Node Sale, reflects its commitment to fostering a robust Web3 gaming ecosystem. Meanwhile, Celo is transitioning from a standalone EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain to an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. By utilizing the OP Stack and EigenDA for data availability, this strategic shift aims to preserve Celo’s hallmark features of speed, low costs, and user-friendliness, while strengthening security and integration within the Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, the establishment of the Stabila Foundation is set to promote stablecoin adoption on the Celo network, particularly in emerging markets. These developments underscore the dynamic and innovative nature of the blockchain sector, with each project contributing distinctively to the evolution of this rapidly advancing industry. Why Lightchain AI Stands Out Lightchain AI represents one of the most transformative investment opportunities in the industry. By combining AI and blockchain technology, it addresses key challenges in scalability and utility, enabling developers to create innovative solutions for real-world problems. Lightchain AI’s Memecoin Launchpad brings this vision to life by providing a secure, AI-powered platform where creators and developers can innovate, monetize their ideas, and contribute to a thriving creative economy. For investors seeking substantial returns, Lightchain AI offers a compelling opportunity. With early-stage pricing, a track record of presale success, and the potential for significant growth, it stands out as a leading crypto investment for 2025. As blockchain and AI continue to converge, Lightchain AI is well-positioned to lead the market, making it a valuable addition to forward-thinking investment portfolios. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Glassnode says on the social media platform X that it is keeping a close watch on Bitcoin’s short-term holder (STH) cost basis, a metric that tracks the average price at which investors who have held their BTC for less than 155 days acquired their coins. According to Glassnode, historical data shows that Bitcoin tends to enter bear territory when its price moves below the metric’s value. “Bitcoin’s Short-Term Holder (STH) cost-basis model is crucial for gauging sentiment among new investors. Historically, this model has tracked market lows during bull cycles and also distinguished bull from bear markets. BTC price is now around 7% above the STH cost-basis of $88,135. If the price stabilizes below this level, it can signal waning sentiment among new investors – which is often a turning point in market trends.” Source: Glassnode/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,425. Looking at the long-term holders, or investors who have held their BTC for 155 days or more, Glassnode says the cohort is unloading their Bitcoin at a drastically rapid rate. According to the analytics firm, the extreme distribution of long-term holders does not necessarily suggest that the Bitcoin bull market is over. “Even at prices about 12% below all-time highs, Bitcoin Long-Term Holders (LTHs) are still distributing, but at a slower rate. Yet, the 30-day percent change in LTH supply suggests that the rate of distribution has likely peaked, reaching extremes seen in previous cycles… In past cycles, prices continued to climb even after LTH distribution peaked. This infers that a peak in distribution doesn’t always align with an immediate macro top.” Source: Glassnode/X Glassnode concludes its analysis by noting that almost all long-term holders are in the green. “Another factor to consider: Bitcoin LTH supply in loss remains at 0%. Nearly all Long-Term Holders are still in profit. Historically, when LTHs experience persistent losses that grow in severity, it has often marked the true end of a cycle. For now, that’s not the case.” Source: Glassnode/X Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Dogecoin’s potential remains a hot topic, with experts providing a Dogecoin price prediction that suggests intriguing movements in 2025. Meanwhile, Solana’s DeFi strength is grabbing attention, with Solana TVL reaching an impressive $9.52 billion, marking a three-year high. BlockDAG , on the other hand, is gearing up for its highly anticipated 2025 mainnet launch, a milestone expected to drive BDAG’s value further. To celebrate, it announced the limited-time LAUNCH300 code. This generous offer delivers a 300% bonus on BDAG purchases, fueling more demand as the presale breaks records and momentum builds. Dogecoin Price Prediction 2025: Insights & Expected Trends Dogecoin has remained a notable topic in the cryptocurrency market, and its performance in 2025 continues to intrigue analysts. According to recent forecasts, Dogecoin price prediction for the year suggests values ranging from $0.30 to $0.44, influenced by significant developments such as market trends and network activity. A recent tweet by KrissPax highlights the similarities between Dogecoin’s current price action and its movements in previous years, suggesting a potential major move up in 2025 following periods of consolidation. As experts set their Dogecoin price predictions, the $0.40 resistance level emerges as a critical focus. The future of Dogecoin will depend on market dynamics and investor sentiment. Solana TVL Reaches 3-Year High: What’s Driving the Growth? Solana has achieved a significant milestone, with Solana TVL surpassing $9.52 billion, marking its highest level in three years. This growth is supported by a thriving decentralised finance (DeFi) ecosystem and an impressive $3.98 billion in 24-hour DEX trading volume, outpacing Ethereum and other Layer 2 solutions. The network’s scalability and low transaction costs have attracted widespread adoption, while its proposed SIMD-0215 upgrade aims to enhance real-time account updates for future demand. As Solana TVL continues to grow, the blockchain’s efficiency and capacity to process high transaction volumes solidify its position as a key player in the DeFi space. 2025 Marks BlockDAG’s Big Leap: Grab the LAUNCH300 Bonus While It Lasts BlockDAG is celebrating its upcoming 2025 launch with an exceptional bonus offer: the limited-time LAUNCH300 code. This code provides a flat 300% bonus in BDAG coins for every purchase, making it one of the most generous deals in the market. For instance, purchasing $200 worth of BDAG coins using the code adds an additional $600 in bonus coins, drastically increasing the buyer’s allocation. With the presale already generating excitement, this bonus is a rare opportunity. However, the LAUNCH300 code won’t last forever. BlockDAG’s presale has taken the crypto market by storm, raising over $179.5 million and selling more than 17.8 billion BDAG coins. The coin’s value has soared by 2380%, climbing from $0.001 in its initial batch to $0.0248 in the current batch 27. This remarkable growth has placed BlockDAG firmly on the radar as one of the best long term crypto coins. With a thriving presale and unmatched demand, BDAG’s success continues to build anticipation for the network’s full launch. As BlockDAG prepares for its 2025 launch, all eyes are on BDAG. Analysts predict its value could climb to $20 by 2027, reflecting the coin’s massive potential. This rapid growth, paired with BlockDAG’s momentum, signals a bright future. The LAUNCH300 bonus adds another layer of excitement, offering buyers a chance to secure more coins at a crucial point in BDAG’s journey. With time running out, this combination of presale success, bonus rewards, and future potential makes BDAG an enticing option in the crypto world. Bringing It All Together Recent Dogecoin price prediction places DOGE in the spotlight, with analysts eyeing a range of $0.30 to $0.44, fueled by market momentum and strong network activity. Meanwhile, Solana TVL breaking $9.52 billion underscores its dominance in decentralised finance, driven by scalability and adoption. But BlockDAG steals the show as its record-breaking presale paves the way for a monumental 2025 mainnet launch. The limited-time LAUNCH300 code, offering an extraordinary 300% bonus on BDAG purchases, is generating massive buzz. With presale demand soaring and analysts predicting a $20 valuation by 2027, missing out on BlockDAG now could mean missing one of the best long term crypto opportunities.

Donald Pumps (DONPUMPS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONPUMPS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Pumps can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Pumps could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Pumps launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Pumps on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Pumps by entering its contract address – 4AiQS1KegadchxjSm4hmifemyRE7gyk3Hieca9wGXGts – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.

The response came after a user claimed that Litecoin's emergence and Charlie Lee's actions represented an early example of a pump-and-dump scheme. The user compared the project negatively to Solana, claiming that Charlie Lee founded Litecoin, set aside a significant amount of supply for himself, and sold it at the height of the 2017 bull run. The comment accused the Litecoin founder of using the project for personal gain and argued that Solana deserves more respect for his contributions to the crypto space. In response, the Litecoin team issued a detailed refutation, defending the project’s transparency, decentralization, and longevity since its inception in 2011. The team noted that Charlie Lee publicly announced Litecoin ahead of its launch, allowing the community to determine the launch date. Unlike many modern projects, Litecoin had no pre-mined supply, no initial coin offering (ICO), and no venture capital funding. Charlie Lee, like other participants, mined and purchased Litecoin and did not maintain a “founders stash.” He later sold his holdings in 2017 to avoid a conflict of interest while continuing to develop and defend the project. Contrary to claims, the team noted that Lee sold his Litecoin at an average price of $205, below the peak of the 2017 bull market. Related News: Famous ETF Expert Made 10 Predictions for the Cryptocurrency Market in 2025 - “XRP, Solana...” The response detailed Charlie Lee’s ongoing financial and technical support for Litecoin: He has invested millions in Litecoin through the Litecoin Foundation and partnerships. He has supported marketing campaigns including collaborations with the Miami Dolphins, UFC and others. It holds its annual Litecoin Summit, costing $250,000 and up per event. He actively contributed to Litecoin's core code and encouraged its adoption among businesses and regulators. The team rejected comparisons to Solana and other projects, stating that Litecoin remains unique in its decentralization, lack of founder-controlled reserves, and lack of venture capital influence. They noted that Litecoin has consistently ranked in the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market cap for over 13 years, despite market volatility and the collapse of thousands of other projects. In their closing remarks, the team questioned Solana’s main use cases and claimed that its ecosystem is frequently used to create tokens that are involved in scams and fraud. *This is not investment advice.

The analyst added that breaking this level could be a turning point. The Bitcoin price is currently around $ 94,636.

Trump’s administration is promising to turn it into a cornerstone of US economic strategy. Meanwhile, BlackRock, the same company holding over half a million Bitcoins valued at $52.81 billion through its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has its own battles to fight — with regulators breathing down its neck. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) isn’t cutting BlackRock any slack. And Trump’s big Bitcoin plans? Let’s just say they don’t make things any easier for Mr. Larry Fink. But hey, at least BlackRock’s a Bitcoin whale now. BlackRock vs. FDIC Here’s what is going down with the FDIC. BlackRock was supposed to meet a January 10 deadline to address concerns about its influence on US banks. However, It didn’t. Instead, it asked for more time—until March 31—to review a proposed agreement, claiming it needed at least two more months. The FDIC wasn’t buying it. The agency not only rejected the extension but also added more demands. They want more transparency about how BlackRock makes decisions and details about its bank-related holdings. If BlackRock doesn’t act fast, things could get worse, and fast too. Sources familiar with the matter say the FDIC might issue subpoenas or take other mandatory actions to force the firm’s compliance. This isn’t a minor dispute. BlackRock’s sheer size, combined with its massive stakes in banks, has some regulators worried it could have too much control over the financial system. Jonathan McKernan, a Republican FDIC board member, and Rohit Chopra, the Democratic head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have both called for tighter oversight of big asset managers. Their main argument is that BlackRock could sway how banks operate, making them less independent. BlackRock’s defense has so far been calling the FDIC’s demands disruptive, arguing that new rules could wreck index funds—one of its flagship offerings—and make it harder for banks to raise cash. The company also says the FDIC needs to coordinate its efforts with the Federal Reserve, which already oversees its operations through a passivity agreement. Trump’s Bitcoin play Trump, along with Bitcoin-friendly figures like Senator Cynthia Lummis, is pushing for a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Here’s the plan: Senator Lummis has introduced a bill proposing the US Treasury and Federal Reserve acquire 1 million Bitcoins over five years. That’s 200,000 Bitcoins a year, adding up to about 5% of the total global supply. The goal? To reduce America’s reliance on traditional financial systems and keep up with rivals like China and Russia. Dennis Porter, the co-founder of the Satoshi Act Fund, spilled the details. The reserve would partly come from Bitcoins seized in criminal investigations, giving the government a head start. Trump’s team believes this reserve could help stabilize the dollar while tackling the US’s enormous $36 trillion national debt. BlackRock, despite its massive Bitcoin holdings, isn’t on the same page. The firm has been making headlines for other reasons, like its withdrawal from the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAMI). BlackRock pulled out of NZAMI on January 11, under pressure from Republican-led states that weren’t happy with its climate-focused investments. The company insists it will continue to consider climate risks in its investment strategies, but the decision shows how political tensions are forcing it to adapt.

Even more alarming is that these scammers don’t fit a specific profile or background. That’s precisely what happened to Ministerio Apostólico Profético Tiempos de Poder parishioners in Pasco, Washington, when they fell for a cryptocurrency scam run by their pastor. According to the US Department of Justice, the Eastern District of Washington has formally charged Francier Obando Pinillo , a 51-year-old Miami resident and pastor, with 26 counts of fraud. The DOJ released a document stating that the pastor masterminded a crypto scam from November 2021 to October 2023, costing unsuspecting investors millions of dollars. Solano Fi Came To The Pastor “In A Dream” Pinillo was the pastor of the Ministerio Apostólico Profético Tiempos de Poder in Pasco, Washington, with its Spanish-speaking congregation. According to the charge sheet, the scam was called “Solano Fi.” This was not your ordinary crypto scam that you’ve read many times online. According to multiple sources, the idea to offer a crypto investment came to Father Pinillo in “a dream.” Pinillo used the pulpit and his authority in the parish to sell the investment to his congregation, assuring that Solano Fi was safe and offered guaranteed payouts. The pastor reportedly dangled a monthly return of 34.9%, and to attract more investors, he ran a social media blitz. Pinillo allegedly launched a Telegram group, the “Multimillionarios SolanaFi,” with more than 1,500 members, and a Solano Fi Facebook page. Solano Fi Investment A Ponzi-Scheme According to investigators, investors lost their money while Pinillo’s personal wealth continued to increase. Instead of staking the funds, the authorities learned that they were funnelled into the personal accounts of the pastors and other scammers. Authorities also discovered that Pinillo offered a 15% Referral Bonus to motivate others to join and invest their money, creating a Ponzi-like program . Under this scheme, the pastor used the new investors’ funds to pay off the “profit” of earlier investors. Reasons Instead Of Profits Pinillo and his partners also launched an online platform that investors can supposedly check to track their investments. However, according to the DOJ, the online platform only showed fake balances and did not allow investors to withdraw their money. Investors’ woes worsened when they started to request payouts. After asking for their funds, they were often told that withdrawals were not possible because of a faulty website or a bearish crypto market. Some investors shared that Pinillo will only refund the investment unless they can bring in new investors to “buy out” the accounts. If found guilty, Pinillo will serve a maximum of 20 years.

Top Crypto Influencer Makes Bold Prediction",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-350000-top-crypto-influencer-makes-bold-prediction/,"Jeremie Davinci, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency domain, has garnered attention with his audacious forecast that Bitcoin may attain an extraordinary value of $350,000. This forecast, lately disseminated on social media, is predicated on historical trends and the present dynamics of Bitcoin mining expenses. Related Reading: $7,000 Ethereum In Sight? Expert Breaks Down The Potential Path The current expense for miners to generate one Bitcoin is approximately $70,000. Davinci indicates that historically, under positive market conditions, Bitcoin has frequently surpassed its mining cost by a ratio of five. This association indicates that, if historical trends persist, a price of $350,000 is feasible. The Cost Factor Of Mining The basis of Davinci’s approach is the relationship between mining costs and market price of Bitcoin. The mining process requires electricity and advanced technology among other resources. These costs build the basis for Bitcoin’s value as they rise. Currently spending over $70,000 to extract one BTC, miners may open the path for significant price increases in the future, claims Davinci. It costs miners about $70k to produce 1 #Bitcoin now, less with better hardware or cheap energy. In past bull markets, Bitcoin’s price has hit over 5x the mining cost. Huge potential ahead! — Davinci Jeremie (@Davincij15) January 11, 2025 He underscores that this forecast lacks a defined timescale and instead embodies an optimistic perspective grounded in historical performance. He asserted, “Significant potential lies ahead!” in reference to Bitcoin’s future price trajectory. Bitcoin: Institutional Impact And Market Forces Davinci’s prognosis is set against a landscape of growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Prominent corporations have commenced the acquisition of substantial quantities of BTC, indicating assurance in its long-term growth prospects. Companies such as BlackRock and MicroStrategy have made substantial investments in Bitcoin, contributing to the optimistic feeling around the cryptocurrency. In addition, the recent halving event in April 2024 cut the block payment for miners to 3.125 BTC. This made it harder for new coins to enter the market. Around 19.9 million Bitcoins have already been mined, leaving less than 2 million to be made. This could cause prices to rise as long as people want them. A Prudent Optimism Although Davinci’s projection is undeniably ambitious, it is crucial to regard such forecasts with prudence. The bitcoin market is famously unstable and can undergo significant fluctuations in value. Analysts have observed that although Bitcoin may realize considerable increases over time, it has also had huge corrections in previous cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Challenge Gold: Expert Sees US Taking The Lead As we approach 2025 and beyond, numerous investors are closely observing how these dynamics will develop. The interplay between mining expenses, institutional acceptance, and market mood will be a major determining factor in ascertaining the feasibility of Davinci’s prediction. Bold predictions like Jeremie Davinci’s are being debated as the crypto market continues to evolve. His forecast of Bitcoin reaching $350,000 reflects both reliance on historical trends and a sense of optimism.

From being a fun and quirky joke coin, Dogecoin quickly rose to fame, attracting an army of passionate holders and garnering massive attention from celebrities and influencers alike. The ICO was priced so low that it was a goldmine for early investors, with some even making millions from what was once just a silly meme coin. With Dogecoin currently holding a place as one of the most widely recognized meme coins in the world, its price has seen explosive growth over the years, and its future seems to be filled with even more promise. But for those who regret not getting in at the right time, there’s still hope. Enter BTFD Coin—a new player in the meme coin world that’s making waves with its exciting presale numbers and its standout feature: a jaw-dropping 90% APY on staking ! The Missed Opportunity: Dogecoin’s ICO and Rise to Fame Let’s talk numbers. When Dogecoin first hit the market in 2013, its initial price was virtually pennies—$0.0002047 per coin. Early investors, especially those who believed in the coin’s fun-loving culture, watched their investments grow exponentially as Dogecoin became more mainstream. In fact, as of 2025, Dogecoin has hit highs of over $0.70 per coin. That’s a massive jump for a coin that started as a joke. With over $49 billion in market cap, Dogecoin’s growth has solidified its place in meme coin history. And while Dogecoin’s story is one for the books, many missed out on that golden opportunity. Investors who saw its potential too late are left with nothing but “what ifs” and “could’ve, should’ve, would’ve” thoughts. But don’t sweat it! The world of meme coins is far from over, and if you’re still hungry for that early investor magic, BTFD Coin could be your golden ticket.

At the same time, Foresight Ventures’ X account was hacked, linked to $500,000 raised through 15 compromised accounts, showing rising security risks. Crypto hacks happen, but the market bounces back There has been so much hacking from the Mt. Gox hack in 2014 up to hacks on Litecoin and Foresight Ventures’ X accounts in 2025. Each hack is similar; it starts with chaos, breaking trust, and lowering the market prices. Time heals most wounds as prices tend to bounce back usually stronger than before. Litecoin’s official X account was hacked on January 11, 2025. An attacker released a fake token based on the Solana network, named using the ticker LTC, via the said account. Litecoin's X account was briefly compromised today and posts that were not authorized were published. These were live only for a matter of seconds before being deleted. We're still investigating the issue, but immediately found a delegated account that was compromised and removed… — Litecoin (@litecoin) January 11, 2025 A post including a Solana contract address and a scam link briefly propelled the fake token’s market cap to $27,000. The value of the token, however, cratered to $3,400 after a scam alert was published. The Litecoin team regained control, deleted the post, and removed the hacked delegated account. They assured users that investigations are currently being done on the issue. At the same time, hackers accessed Foresight Ventures’ X account. It was used for promoting fraudulent activity with cryptocurrencies tied to AI. Such a hack was alarming, as Foresight Ventures has close ties to blockchain and AI projects. Yet, the team acted fast: it issued warnings and solved the problem. At the end of December 2024, hackers broke into the Cardano Foundation’s X account. They falsely claimed a lawsuit with the SEC and sold a scam token called “ADAsol.” It has been reported that one hacker managed to raise $500,000 by exploiting more than 15 hacked X accounts for meme coin scams during late 2024 and early 2025. These hacks are often phishing emails masquerading as legitimate messages, tricking victims into sharing their credentials. Hacks have been a bane in the crypto industry for years. In 2014, the Mt. Gox hack resulted in over $450 million worth of Bitcoin being stolen, causing the collapse of what was then the largest exchange. The Bitfinex hack in 2016 led to the loss of 120,000 BTC, worth $72 million at the time. In 2018, $530 million in NEM tokens were stolen from Coincheck. Such occurrences demonstrate the impact hacks can have on the crypto market. In the case of 2020, hackers hijacked the Twitter accounts of influential people such as Elon Musk and Joe Biden, displaying them with fake Bitcoin giveaways. Although the financial loss was not too massive, it highlighted the need to protect influential accounts. In 2022, the hack of the Ronin Network targeting Axie Infinity stole $625 million and marked one of the biggest crypto robberies ever; it was said to question a centralized blockchain gaming ecosystem. The WazirX hack in 2024 joined the list of concerns regarding centralized exchanges. From hacks to altseason Most hacks lead to short-term market drops due to users panicking and withdrawing funds. These, however, happen at the worst time when the crypto market prepares for an altseason in which altcoins tend to do way better than Bitcoin. This might, therefore, be an opportunity for the market to get over such shocks and enjoy substantial growth. The attacks that Litecoin and Foresight Ventures experienced may be minor in comparison but show a possibility of going wrong in the crypto space. However, growth in the market may still be true, especially around the time of altseason and with bettering security in security. There is a bright long-term future for the crypto market. Whether hacks would be in the way of problems or growth will depend on whether these incidents can be studied and leveraged to improve security.

Key highlights include the anticipated rise in Ethereum Classic (ETC) price to $49.07 and SUI nearing a peak at $5.35, coupled with robust investor interest. Amid these developments, BlockDAG (BDAG) , a notable layer-1 blockchain entity, rolls out its referral program, offering up to 10% in USDT rewards, significantly fueling the demand for its tokens. Here’s an analysis of these pivotal market elements to gauge the top crypto gem for 2025. Ethereum Classic Price Prediction: Targeting $49 in 2025! Forecasting a significant upturn, Ethereum Classic (ETC) is predicted to escalate to a peak of $49.07 by 2025. Investors need a thorough technical analysis to navigate this potential. Currently, ETC is trading at $25.28, with market reactions mixed and a transaction volume of $326.06 million in the last 24 hours.
