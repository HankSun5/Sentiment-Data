Ethereum’s Role and Future in Blockchain Ecosystem Ethereum stands out for its innovation and versatility in the blockchain field. It is a leader in smart contract technology and decentralized applications, or dApps. Its ecosystem includes decentralized finance and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon to improve transaction speeds. Ethereum began in 2015 and shifted to a Proof-of-Stake model in 2022, enhancing its focus on decentralization. The planned sharding upgrade aims to improve scalability and reduce user costs. Ether (ETH), the network’s native currency, plays a key role. It is used for transaction fees and as a reward for stakers. Looking ahead, Ethereum appears promising based on historical price patterns, with significant growth expected by 2030. Conclusion While established tokens like ETH may see steady growth in the current bull market, Catzilla offers a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale stages. With governance features, loyalty rewards, and passive staking options, Catzilla aims to unite enthusiasts seeking financial freedom. Acquiring $CATZILLA tokens allows participation in a project poised for significant short-term gains.

Like many industry experts, Nate Geraci believes a major shift is coming to the ecosystem this year. XRP and Solana ETF Prospect In 2025 According to Nate Geraci, spot XRP and Solana ETF products will gain approval this year. As reported earlier by Coingape, asset manager VanEck filed the first Solana ETF product in the US in June 2024. Since then, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has welcomed other SOL ETF applications from Grayscale , Canary Capital, and 21Shares. While the Solana products are still under review, Canary Capital filed for XRP ETF in October 2023. This filing changed the crypto ETF outlook and inspired other asset managers to join the trend. While there is no definitive update from the US SEC, the confidence for approval remains high. The change in the US SEC leadership is a major catalyst many are citing will drive the approval. President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkins as US SEC Chair in the coming administration. Atkins is expected to redirect the SEC from its strict approach to crypto under Gary Gensler. Like other industry experts, Geraci believes 2025 will see the launch of Solana and XRP ETF products. The Nate Geraci Crypto ETF Predictions The ETF Store President shared 10 predictions on what to expect in the crypto ETF space. He believes spot Bitcoin ETFs will surpass the physical gold ETFs in assets under management. After one year of launch, several Bitcoin ETF milestones are now on record. The Bitcoin ETF products topped $150 billion Assets Under Management (AUM), a feat that took gold 20 years to achieve. Beyond the approval forecast for Solana and XRP ETF, Geraci also believes the U.S. SEC will approve Ethereum ETF staking this year. My 10 crypto-related ETF predictions for 2025… https://t.co/uDj1OCkaVQ pic.twitter.com/ye3zA2sinV — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) January 11, 2025 Meanwhile, he narrowed the predictions to include specific ETF filings from Grayscale and Bitwise, predicting approvals for both. He predicted that Vanguard would shift its stance and support crypto ETF trading. Donald Trump to Change the Tides President-elect Donald Trump will take office officially on January 20, creating a new era for the industry. Beyond Paul Atkins, Trump also named a Crypto and AI Czar, David Sacks, to help coordinate policies from the White House. As reported by Coingape, one of Sacks’ first tasks is to organize an inaugural crypto ball next week. As predicted by many experts, these trends will help fuel a robust shift in crypto regulation and enforcement. In addition to the Solana and XRP ETF approvals, price boosts are expected for both.

Predictions now indicate a possible surge up to $8. However, instead of the XRP price garnering investors’ interest, analysts have their eyes elsewhere. WallitIQ (WLTQ), a $0.042 altcoin, is stealing the spotlight with its impressive potential to generate 40,000% returns by Q1 2025. Ripple (XRP) May Hit $8 But WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Bring Jaw-dropping 40,000% Gains The XRP price is currently trading around $2.44, with predictions indicating a rise to $8. History shows that the XRP price often rises after new Ripple partnerships. For example, after Ripple Labs announced its partnership with MoneyGram in 2019, the XRP price saw temporary gains. Similarly, the XRP price saw fair hikes after Ripple Labs partnered with banks like Santander and American Express to promote its currency for cross-border payments. In August 2024, Ripple Labs began its partnership with the IMF, a move that is predicted to trigger an XRP price surge this year, perhaps up to $8. However, surges caused by partnerships are often short-lived and less than expectations, and smart analysts know this. Therefore, analysts are bullish on a surer option: a rising altcoin currently priced at $0.0420. This altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ), is not based on fleeting partnerships but on the latest AI technology, a factor that will inevitably trigger rapid adoption and jaw-breaking surges in Q1 2025. Already demonstrating its impressive potential, this altcoin generated over $6 million in the last presale stages as thousands of analysts bought over 350 million tokens. The ongoing presale, which is currently priced at $0.0420 per token, has recently started and has already generated over $200,000 from the sale of 5 million tokens. Analysts predict that this altcoin will effortlessly generate $5 million in monthly revenue by Q1 2025, ultimately dominating the $700 billion crypto wallet and AI market. While the XRP price surge to $8 due to the Ripple partnership is uncertain, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is expected to multiply investments by 40,000% in Q1 2025. Therefore, analysts advise investors to take advantage of this life-changing opportunity by joining the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale immediately. The $0.0420 price will not last for long, as hundreds of investors are joining the presale daily. For investors who want massive gains in Q1 2025, the best time to act is now. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Be The Next Game-Changer In Crypto A major reason why analysts are bullish on WallitIQ (WLTQ) despite the XRP price predictions is that this altcoin presents something more. This rising altcoin will change the scope of crypto trading with improved security and simplicity features. For instance, WallitIQ (WLTQ) uses a double-layered encryption process to protect transactions. It also features Escrow-connect, an AI-powered tool that double-checks external connections before establishing them. Additionally, WallitIQ (WLTQ) supports biometric authentication. Users can secure their accounts with fingerprints or facial recognition, which are more reliable than pins and passwords. This altcoin platform has publicly audited its smart contract with SolidProof , a top-notch and reliable smart contract auditing firm. Far from being complicated due to advanced security, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is very easy to use, even for beginners. It features a user-friendly interface that supports customizable widgets. The platform also contains a variety of educational resources to help investors learn as they trade. Conclusion While the XRP price is poised to hit $8 following the IMF partnership with Ripple Labs, its growth depends on short-term market reactions. Therefore, analysts are counting on WallitIQ (WLTQ), a highly innovative altcoin projected to grow 40,000% in Q1 2025. For any trader who wants to see massive gains in Q1 2025, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is the way to go. Coins are still going out for a token price of $0.0420, but not for long. With hundreds of investors joining daily, this price will skyrocket soon. Before that happens and you miss your chance, join the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale now.

Known for his active presence on social media, Schwartz recently warned about a new scam targeting crypto users. The Coinbase Impersonation Scam In a recent X post, Schwartz alerted the XRP Army about an alarming phishing tactic. Scammers posing as representatives of Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, are attempting to exploit users through fraudulent emails. The emails claim that recipients must review their account details to ensure seamless operations on the platform. Accompanying this, Schwartz shared an image of one such email, highlighting its deceptive design. Adding to the urgency, some community members confirmed receiving similar emails. One investor recounted receiving the email and a follow-up call from a Canadian phone number impersonating Coinbase support. Thankfully, the user remained vigilant and avoided falling victim to the scam. XRP Community Responds with Gratitude Schwartz has long been a guiding figure for the XRP community during his 12 years at Ripple, frequently sharing valuable advice. In a similar incident in 2024, the Ripple CTO revealed that scammers had tried to contact him by text and email. As mentioned above, the bad actors posed as the ‘Asset Shielding Department’ in the exchange. The phishing attempt aimed to deceive Schwartz into sharing his personal information, presumably to gain unauthorized access to his assets or sensitive data. Schwartz’s swift action earned him accolades from the XRP community. Many expressed gratitude for his vigilance, with one user dubbing him a “true community caretaker.” Others echoed the sentiment, appreciating his consistent efforts to safeguard the ecosystem. A Growing Threat of Crypto Scams The rise of digital assets has brought innovation and opportunity, but it has also increased illicit activities like phishing scams. These scams often target unsuspecting users, tricking them into revealing sensitive information or transferring funds. Many users have fallen victim to such schemes, losing access to their accounts and hard-earned assets. Industry leaders and regulatory agencies are taking proactive measures to combat the rise in scams . As seen in Schwartz’s recent tweet, companies like Ripple are educating users about security threats and sharing timely warnings. Exchanges also enhance their security protocols, implement two-factor authentication, and monitor suspicious activity. Regulatory agencies have introduced stricter guidelines to protect users. Governments worldwide are cracking down on fraudulent activities, requiring exchanges to verify user identities and report suspicious transactions. Some agencies have also launched public awareness campaigns to help users recognize and avoid scams.

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-11 21:24:00

As the weekend approaches, Tether has performed exemplary, topping the weekly revenue chart with $122.78 Million in fees for the last seven days. The latest data from DefiLlama shows the revenue performance of different sectors within the crypto ecosystem. The data shows that stablecoin issuers are performing well. This weekly fee revenue data highlights the success of protocols that focus on providing value to users willing to pay for services rather than relying solely on token price speculation. The revenue data indicates a change in crypto trading. Early crypto traders depended on price surges, while current traders relied on earning fees from actual services, including payment processing, lending, trading, and blockchain usage fees. The dominance of Tether in fee generation, followed by Circle ($33.33 Million) and Ethereum ($30.33 Million), shows how critical financial infrastructure commands the highest user payments. Source: DefiLlama Stablecoins are putting up top performance in the blockchain ecosystem Tether’s weekly revenue of $122.78 Million shows how critical stablecoins have become to crypto’s financial system. The fee accumulates from transaction costs as users always transfer USDT across different blockchains. Tether supports 11 networks, including Ethereum, Tron, and Solana. Circle appeared second among stablecoin issuers, after generating revenue worth $33.33 Million in weekly fees. The pattern gives a clear indication that the need for digital dollars in crypto payments has gone up. Layer-1 blockchains have not been left far behind in fee generation. Solana raised a $35.06 million weekly fee, outperforming Ethereum’s $30.33 million and Tron’s $13.37 Million. The fees show that the Solana network attracts more transactions due to more active users. Liquid staking is also generating a lot of revenue. Jito appears at the top with $43.42 Million earned in weekly fees, with Lido generating $20.78 Million across several chains. There is an increase in demand for staking services that give users a way to earn yield without interfering with liquidity. DeFi protocols are keeping up as their performance is promising Most DeFi revenue comes from decentralized exchanges, with Raydium earning $43.36 Million in weekly fees. Uniswap, which is running in more than 22 chains, earned $31.97 Million in weekly fees. Lending platforms like Aave managed $15.32 Million, way below Raydium and Uniswap, which shows that the current market supports trading more than lending. Uniswap has a straightforward revenue model; its fee comes from traders paying to swap tokens. The lending sector, under the DeFi protocol, drives a narrative of a market condition.

Expert Breaks Down The Potential Path",https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/7000-ethereum-in-sight-expert-breaks-down-the-potential-path/,"There is a reason for Ethereum fans to be optimistic, as expert analysis suggests that the cryptocurrency is going to touch the skies in the coming months. As Bitcoin has just crossed $94,000, Ethereum also shows signs of life and bounces back from its recent low and hints at the possibility of price explosion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Remains Below $95k: Analyst Says It’s a Golden Time to Accumulate—Here’s Why A Quick Look At The Patterns Well-known crypto analyst Ali Martinez has found a bullish reversal pattern that can potentially take the price of Ethereum into much higher value. Trading at $3,281 at the moment, Ethereum has slipped below the middle line of its rising channel and has traders spooked. But Martinez is one who thinks if Ethereum could just retest the lower boundary at $2,800 and rebound, it will likely launch into a bullish trend. This rebound may eventually set the stage for Ethereum to reach between $6,000 and $7,000. If #Ethereum $ETH is following an ascending parallel channel, a dip to the lower boundary at $2,800 could act as a launchpad for a move toward $6,000. pic.twitter.com/uYP6BW3DZh — Ali (@ali_charts) January 10, 2025 Market Sentiment & Challenges Even though these are all good signs, the mood in the futures market right now is not clear. Open interest in Ethereum has gone down by 1.25%, which shows that some buyers are becoming more cautious. The long-to-short number is still less than 1, which means that traders are betting against Ethereum instead of for it. Also, funding rates have gone down a lot, which shows that people are less interested in taking leveraged long bets. Although short-term sentiment may be negative, long-term holders may see attractive entry points at current prices. Due to their inherent volatility, cryptocurrencies require constant vigilance and awareness of market trends. Key Resistance Levels All eyes will be on Ethereum’s performance and whether it can overcome important resistance thresholds as we advance into 2025. Several elements determine whether one may achieve $6,000 or even $7,000: market conditions, investor mood, and more general economic impact. At the time of writing, Ether was trading at $3,274, down 0.9% and 9.9% in the daily and weekly timeframes, data from Coingecko shows. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Bounce Back?

Ether is expected to rise by a solid 93% in six months and 94% in three months, according to predictions by CoinCheckup.

So why are so many investors moving over to Rollblock (RBLK), and how will Ethereum fare in the next quarter?

Ethereum has also now brought proto-danksharding onto the Ethereum (ETH) network which has gone a long way to reducing gas fees.

What started as a joke or a mere fad has turned into a legitimate investment avenue, attracting both seasoned investors and curious newcomers. In a world where traditional markets are often volatile, meme coins have emerged as a refreshing alternative, creating unique opportunities for short-term gains. This trend has drawn in a wave of enthusiastic investors eager to cash in on the latest buzz, and trust me, it’s a wild ride. Over the years, meme coins have captured the hearts (and wallets) of millions. From Dogecoin’s meteoric rise to Shiba Inu’s massive community, these playful tokens have shown they can pack a punch in the market. But now, we’re entering a new era with exciting contenders like BTFD Coin that promise to elevate the meme coin phenomenon to dizzying new heights. With features like a play-to-earn game, a lucrative referral program, staking rewards, and a strong community backing, BTFD Coin is not just another meme coin—it’s a game-changer. BTFD Coin is making waves in the presale arena, raising over $5.1 million in just its first month, and it’s not slowing down. As we dive deeper into this article, we’ll explore why BTFD Coin stands out among the best new meme coins to invest in for the short term, comparing it with established names like Brett and Cheems. So, buckle up; we’re about to delve into the nitty-gritty of these exciting projects and see what sets them apart. BTFD Coin: The New Contender in Meme Coins BTFD Coin is the latest player in the meme coin game, and it’s already making headlines. Currently in its 13th presale stage, with a price of just $0.000142, this coin has already sold over 63 billion tokens and amassed a remarkable tally of over 8,000 holders. But what’s really turning heads is its phenomenal presale performance, having raised over $5.1 million in such a short time. Investors are buzzing, and many are already eyeing it as one of the best new meme coins to invest in for the short term. The hype around BTFD Coin isn’t just about numbers—it’s about potential. Analysts are predicting that, with the right momentum, the price could reach $0.0006 by the end of the presale. Let’s break that down. If an investor puts in $35,000 at the current price, they’d snag an impressive 246,478,874 $BTFD Coins. When the price hits $0.0006, that investment could balloon to a staggering $148,000. That’s the kind of short-term gain that gets folks talking! But what’s more exciting is the community aspect of BTFD Coin. This isn’t just a token; it’s about building connections among holders. The referral program incentivises users to bring in new investors, creating a buzz that can drive the price even higher. Plus, the staking rewards mean that those who hold onto their coins can earn while they wait for the price to rise. As the community grows, so does the potential for profits, making BTFD Coin one of the best new meme coins to invest in for the short term. Brett: A Steady Player in the Meme Coin Space Now, let’s talk about Brett. This meme coin may not have the explosive growth of BTFD Coin, but it’s been a steady player in the meme coin market. Brett has built a loyal following, and investors appreciate its stability compared to the often chaotic nature of meme coins. But in a market that thrives on excitement and potential, does Brett still hold its ground as one of the best new meme coins to invest in for the short term? One of the things that set Brett apart is its consistent community engagement. The developers have worked hard to keep the community informed and involved, which has fostered a sense of loyalty among holders. Plus, with its recent updates and enhancements, Brett is showing it’s not just sitting on its laurels. Yet, while it has its strengths, the question remains whether it can compete with the fresh energy that BTFD Coin brings to the table. While Brett has its advantages, the current market sentiment seems to favour new entrants that promise quicker returns. Investors looking for fast profits may be swayed to BTFD Coin, especially given its impressive presale results. However, Brett’s reliability might appeal to those who prefer a more measured approach. In a nutshell, while Brett has its merits, it’s essential to weigh its stability against the potential gains offered by BTFD Coin. Both may have a place in a diversified portfolio, but right now, the spotlight is firmly on BTFD. Cheems: The Meme King Still in the Game Ah, Cheems—the beloved meme coin that has garnered a cult following. It’s been a fan favourite for a while now, but the question is: can it keep up with the new kids on the block like BTFD Coin? Cheems has proven to be a resilient player in the meme coin arena, but its ability to compete for the title of the best new meme coins to invest in for the short term is under scrutiny. Cheems has established a strong community, and its playful branding has certainly helped it capture the hearts of many. However, the meme coin market is ever-evolving, and the excitement surrounding new projects like BTFD Coin is hard to ignore. While Cheems has its strengths, it’s possible that the novelty of newer coins could overshadow its longstanding reputation. Investors looking for a quick turnaround may find Cheems a bit too slow for their liking. With BTFD Coin’s impressive presale performance and dynamic features, it’s no wonder many are flocking to the latter. That said, Cheems still has a loyal base that appreciates its consistency. The challenge lies in whether it can innovate and adapt to the changing landscape of meme coins. In conclusion, while Cheems has remained a solid player in the meme coin market, the recent buzz around BTFD Coin could shift the attention and investment away from it. For those seeking the best new meme coins to invest in for the short term, the choice may lean more towards BTFD, especially with its community-driven features and impressive presale figures. Conclusion: The Future Belongs to the Bold Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that BTFD Coin is shaking things up in the meme coin space. Its impressive presale performance, innovative features, and strong community engagement make it a standout contender among the best new meme coins to invest in for the short term. While Brett and Cheems have their strengths, they may not be able to keep pace with the excitement and potential that BTFD Coin offers. Investors looking for a quick return should seriously consider joining the BTFD Coin presale now. With its potential to explode in value and a community that’s passionate and active, BTFD Coin is paving the way for the future of meme coins.

Recent analysis and sentiment metrics suggest the asset may be on track for a continuation of its bullish trajectory, potentially reaching new all-time highs. Cointelegraph recently highlighted XRP’s price behavior, stating it is preparing for a “powerful move” above the $2.9 mark. This comes as optimism grows within the XRP community, with both technical and on-chain indicators aligning to reinforce a positive outlook. LATEST: $XRP price preps for ‘powerful move' above $2.90 as sentiment metrics signal optimism, suggesting that it’s gearing up for a run to new all-time highs. pic.twitter.com/bstTXx3Uib — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) January 10, 2025 Key Technical Levels Analyzing the digital asset’s 4-hour chart, several critical levels and zones emerge. At the time of Cointelegraph’s analysis, XRP traded at $2.3168, with a recent bounce off the support area of $2.1558 that sent it as high as $2.5. This support zone corresponds to an order block, a region of prior accumulation, that has historically served as a launchpad for upward momentum. Cointelegraph also highlighted a fair value gap (FVG) near the $2.1558–$2.2 range, indicating inefficiencies in price movement that may attract bullish interest. The market may revisit this area before a sustained rally takes place, as liquidity and support converge here. On the resistance side, the daily chart shows a key resistance zone around $2.5. Breaking through this range would likely signal a continuation of XRP’s broader uptrend, potentially pushing it above $2.9. Beyond this, the psychological $3 level could be a magnet for price action, supported by both technical setups and increasing market confidence. If XRP can sustain its momentum, it could reach a new all-time high in no time. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Sentiment and Market Factors The sentiment surrounding XRP remains positive, bolstered by its spectacular performance in late 2024, and its resilience in early 2025. The digital asset has stayed above $2 level for weeks now, and with the positive signs on its chart, it could soon turn the $3 level to support, and potentially target its all-time high of $3.84. At press time, XRP had risen to $2.32 slightly higher than its price at the time of Cointelegraph’s analysis. Other factors could also contribute to XRP’s momentum as it targets the $2.9 threshold. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently met with President-elect Donald Trump and described this meeting as a strong start to 2025 . This meeting and Trump’s upcoming return to office and the resignation of Gary Gensler, current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have set the stage for a massive bullish resurgence.

SUI’s price has recently reached a new high of $5.35, a 20% increase in just 10 days, driven by solid technical signals and increased acceptance. Conversely, Litecoin’s future value is uncertain as it strives to recover from a 40% decline from its December high of $147.22. In this environment, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out with its advanced GHOSTDAG technology and the aggressive LAUNCH300 campaign, which gives a 300% boost on BDAG purchases. Having raised over $179 million, and with analysts expecting its price to hit $1 by 2025, the Layer-1 project is drawing significant attention from large-scale participants and developers. This piece explores the recent developments and future prospects of these promising projects. The Latest 300% Bonus Boosting BDAG Toward $1 BlockDAG Network has been making significant strides in marketing since its inception, quickly securing over 170,000 participants. This Layer 1 project has been prominent for over a year, gaining additional traction as it nears its mainnet launch. A key highlight of BlockDAG’s initiatives is the LAUNCH300 campaign, offering a hefty 300% bonus on BDAG acquisitions. Seen as a potential Kaspa competitor, the project is surrounded by optimistic forecasts, with some analysts predicting it could reach $1 by 2025. BlockDAG continually exceeds expectations on many levels. Its swift transaction capability of 10 blocks per second has attracted both crypto specialists and large-scale participants, while rapid advancements toward mainnet launch have spurred a successful presale, amassing over $179 million worldwide. With plans for establishing a Swiss foundation, allocating grants, and maintaining an active low-code/no-code platform, BlockDAG’s path forward appears robust. With BDAG priced at $0.0248 during the presale, and large-scale participants leveraging the LAUNCH300 code, many view this as an excellent opportunity for long-term engagement. Litecoin’s Price Fluctuations: Can LTC Climb to $184 or Dip Further? Litecoin’s future price trajectory is unpredictable as it currently trades below the crucial $110 resistance mark. Despite an impressive 120% surge in late 2024, Litecoin has struggled to keep up the pace, falling 40% from its December high of $147.22. Nevertheless, LTC has managed to uphold its descending resistance trend line as support twice, signaling a possible upturn. With RSI and MACD showing neutral readings, there are no definitive signs of a bullish breakout or a continued downfall. The wave analysis hints that Litecoin might be embarking on its fifth upward movement, eyeing $184 as per Fibonacci retracement levels. The pivotal $110 level will likely shape its long-term trajectory. Until there’s a significant market move, Litecoin’s future price remains a balanced play of hope and caution. Will SUI Continue to Climb or Retreat? The SUI price has surged remarkably, setting a new record at $5.35, following a rapid 20% increase in just ten days. This surge has eclipsed major altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. Since November 2024, SUI has been charting a bullish path within a rising channel, bolstered by solid technical indicators such as RSI and SMA. Having surpassed a $2 billion Total Value Locked (TVL) with 69.75% of its tokens locked, SUI’s potential remains strong. If the momentum persists, SUI may revisit its peak and target $6.60. Conversely, a downturn could see it approaching critical support near $4.50. SUI continues to draw significant interest due to its robust growth and potential for long-term appreciation. Summing Up the Top Cryptos In 2025, Sui, Litecoin, and BlockDAG each offer distinct prospects within the cryptocurrency space. SUI’s recent peak of $5.35 and its substantial $2 billion TVL underscore its robust expansion potential, possibly pushing toward $6.60. On the other hand, Litecoin faces a cautious path, as it struggles to breach the $110 mark aiming for $184, with essential technical support being crucial. BlockDAG, meanwhile, shines with its advanced GHOSTDAG protocol, rapid transaction capabilities, and the impactful LAUNCH300 campaign, which has helped gather $179 million in crypto presale . For those looking to diversify, the upward trajectory of Sui, the potential recovery of Litecoin, and the pioneering technology of BlockDAG present strong cases for consideration.

According to the local press, the man has been forced to move his family from one Airbnb to the next because the police are apparently unable to guarantee their safety. Criminals Intended to Torture Victim Speaking about the attempted kidnapping, the father of four told the Quebec newspaper La Presse that his would-be abductors had been prepared to mete out violence on him and his children to achieve their goal. He said they had torture equipment and probably intended to cut one of his limbs using a two-foot by two-foot tarpaulin with a hole in the middle and claws around it. The victim’s ordeal began on November 4, 2024, when two masked men threatened him outside his house, but he managed to lock his door before they could gain entry. On November 8, he claimed to have noticed a black car without a license plate parked near his home, prompting him to contact the police. A few days later, the man said he found himself behind the same strange vehicle on a main road before it suddenly swerved, causing him to pull over. One of the car’s occupants then reportedly pulled a gun on the unidentified individual, forcing him to use pepper spray to defend himself. Following investigations, police arrested four suspects, with two of them appearing in court in November 2024, accused of plotting an abduction and being in possession of illegal firearms. Having no prior criminal records, the alleged assailants were released on bail and confined under house arrest until March 2025, when their trial was scheduled to begin. The move left the crypto enthusiast living in fear, as he suspected his attackers may have links to organized crime, compelling him to find temporary accommodation in different places. According to the police, the culprits targeted the victim, believing he owned 2.5 million BTC after being misled by posts on a Facebook page he had been moderating for the last few years. However, the man claims his Bitcoin holdings may be worth only $10,000 at most. Rising Threats According to Casa co-founder Jameson Lopp, there have been more than 100 physical attacks on BTC holders in the last few years. In October 2024, the crypto security expert launched an archive chronicling several violent encounters digital asset owners had faced, including stabbings in New York City and kidnappings in Lithuania and Turkey. This latest case signals rising crypto-related abductions, especially in Canada. In November last year, Dean Skurka, CEO of prominent crypto firm WonderFi, was reportedly hijacked in Toronto and forced to pay $720,000 to secure his release. In the same month, Montreal police discovered the body of crypto influencer Kevin Mirshahi, who had been kidnapped earlier in the year along with three others. Mirshahi had been accused of promoting a pump-and-dump scheme involving a cryptocurrency called Marsan (MRS), whose value plummeted by more than 90%, causing untold losses to thousands of investors.

In a decisive move, CEO Eric Turner has confirmed the layoff of 15% of the company’s workforce. This shift aims to sharpen focus on what Messari does best: delivering top-tier crypto data and insights. For now, the company has chosen not to announce the changes formally, but the impact is clear. “Streamlining for Growth”: The New Messari Direction The layoffs include full-time employees and contractors whose terms were not renewed. Notably, this is a common step for businesses at the start of a new year. Messari’s decision struggles in the crypto industry, with companies like Kraken, Sky Mavis, and Paxos cutting jobs. Even competitor CoinDesk has weathered multiple layoffs, signaling an industry-wide belt-tightening. For Messari, this is not a retreat; it is a refocus. Founded in 2018, the company has built a reputation for clear analytics, reliable pricing data, and its popular Mainnet conference in New York. These layoffs could signal a pivot toward consolidating its strongest assets. Ryan Selkis Fuels The Messari Legacy of Vision and Controversy Messari was started by Ryan Selkis, a leader known for being influential and controversial. Selkis pushed the company forward with big ideas, but his strong opinions on social media caused problems. In one case, he argued with critics of President-elect Donald Trump and made harsh comments during a political debate. Eventually, Selkis stepped down, saying his outspoken nature had put the company at risk. Turner’s Steady Hand in a Shifting Market Selkis’s departure paved the way for Eric Turner, a calmer and more focused leader, to take charge. Turner’s promotion to CEO marked a turning point. Under his leadership, Messari has shifted its approach. The firm moved from Selkis’ grand vision of hiring 1,000 analysts to a more streamlined, efficiency-driven model. Despite recent challenges, Messari remains a heavyweight in the crypto research space. Backed by financial giants like Point72 Ventures and Galaxy Digital, the company raised $35 million in its series B funding round in 2022 . Turner’s plan focuses on helping Messari’s smaller team deliver great insights while staying competitive. Messari’s restructuring is part of a larger story unfolding across the crypto world. After years of fast growth, companies face tough choices and must plan carefully. For Messari, this could be the fresh start it needs to succeed in a market where survival depends on focus and innovation.

Pepe Rescues Trump (PEPERTRU), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPERTRU is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Rescues Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Rescues Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Rescues Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Rescues Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Rescues Trump by entering its contract address – HtgdKmNDff2UgXmmJYCryKhjVE2F89XMncNt8oThipHz – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPERTRU. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-11 22:50:00

Over the past 24 hours, FTM price has rebounded and has now crossed the $0.7 resistance level per current market data. Drawing on the Sonic hype, this current Fantom rebound might usher in more uptick soon. The Sonic Chain Milestone and Ecosystem Trend According to Sonic Chain’s update, it has reached the $100 million Total Value Locked (TVL) milestone. The protocol recorded this milestone in less than 6 weeks since the Sonic Genesis block went live . $100 Million TVL. pic.twitter.com/UKICYqrv0k — Sonic Labs (@SonicLabs) January 11, 2025 While this milestone is significant, it is not the first for the protocol. Per an earlier update from Coingape, Sonic Chain breached the 1 million block milestone about 3 weeks after it launched. The total value locked is a metric that depicts the cumulative amount of capital resident on the blockchain. Since its inception, Sonic Labs, the previous Fantom, has released some Decentralized Applications (DApps) on the protocol. An Ethereum bridge went live in late December 2024 to chart a strong foundation for the network. Implication for Fantom Price While the Sonic Chain has its native token, S, most of the advances within its ecosystem impact Fantom’s price the most. When writing, the coin changed hands for $0.7206, up by 2.82% in the past 24 hours. Amid the drawdown of the past week, the price of FTM jumped from a low of $0.6929 to a high of $0.7296 before resting at its current level. Fantom had a rocky year in 2024, with a combined growth of 71%. This 52-week growth rate pales compared to its core rivals like Solana (SOL), which has jumped 90%. Meanwhile, Sonic Labs seeks to change the future for Fantom through the new chain. With better speed, connectivity, and a robust ecosystem, the expectation is that FTM may breach the $1 mark in the short term. The Altcoin Season Advantage Amid the push for relevance in the broader blockchain ecosystem, Sonic Chain and Fantom may benefit from the price surge the expected altcoin season might usher in soon. In a recent update, Santiment data shows HODLer count growth for Ethereum , Dogecoin, and other top altcoins. This metric shows a broader market confidence for these chains, a trend that may impact Fantom if it persists. In addition, the incoming Donald Trump administration is poised to benefit altcoins, considering the President-elect’s family is pro-DeFi.

Sui’s impressive all-time high of $5.36 and Sei’s steady price gains are grabbing attention. However, Web3Bay is emerging as the real game-changer in blockchain-based commerce. Known as the “Amazon of Web3,” Web3Bay delivers lower fees, full transparency, and direct buyer-seller rewards. Unlike traditional marketplaces, it cuts out middlemen to create a fairer system. Its presale is a chance to get in early on what many see as a promising project. For those exploring cryptos with real-world utility, Web3Bay could lead the next wave of decentralized e-commerce. Web3Bay: A New Era for Blockchain Commerce Web3Bay is rapidly becoming a leader in decentralized commerce, often called the “Amazon of Web3.” By combining blockchain’s strengths with the simplicity of an online marketplace, it delivers exactly what buyers and sellers need—lower fees, better transparency, and direct rewards. Unlike Amazon, Web3Bay removes middlemen, creating a peer-to-peer system where users get the full benefits without additional costs. This unique approach makes it one of the underrated cryptos to watch now. The ongoing presale is gathering pace, allowing early adopters to purchase 3BAY tokens at $0.0039675 during stage three. The presale has already raised over $580,000, with each stage seeing a 15% price increase. Early participants could achieve a return on investment (ROI) of over 6,430%, mirroring the early days of Amazon when those who believed in its potential reaped major rewards. What sets Web3Bay apart from others is its user-focused system. Sellers earn better margins, buyers gain rewards, and blockchain ensures total transparency in transactions. The platform is building for the future, with plans to introduce staking and cross-chain compatibility to increase flexibility. For anyone exploring underrated cryptos with real-world applications, Web3Bay could be the game-changer of 2025, poised to revolutionize decentralized e-commerce. Sui Hits New All-Time High of $5.36 – What’s Driving the Surge? Sui recently reached a new milestone, with its Sui all-time high hitting $5.36. As a Layer 1 blockchain known for its low-latency, high-speed transactions, Sui has quickly become a favorite for DeFi applications. Its unique parallel transaction model allows developers to build fast, scalable dApps, making it a strong contender in the blockchain industry. The network’s TVL has crossed $1.85 billion, reflecting growing trust from the community. Partnerships, such as with Franklin Templeton Digital Assets, and the upcoming AI integrations are adding further momentum. Despite minor setbacks like the November 2024 network outage, Sui remains a solid choice for blockchain enthusiasts. Sei Price Holding Strong – What’s Supporting Its Stability? The Sei price remains steady at $0.38874, continuing to show resilience in the ever-changing crypto market. Sei’s blockchain, designed for decentralized exchanges (DEXs), has carved out a niche by offering ultra-fast transaction times of just 380 milliseconds. Recent developments are fueling Sei’s stability, including the planned Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, set for release in 2024. This upgrade will make it easier for developers to bring their smart contracts to Sei, attracting a wider range of users. As the ecosystem grows with platforms like DragonSwap and Pallet Exchange, Sei’s long-term potential remains strong. Final Takeaway: Why Consider Web3Bay? With Sui’s all-time high reaching $5.36 and the Sei price holding firm at $0.38874, both blockchains show strong promise in their respective areas. Sui’s focus on scalable DeFi solutions and Sei’s ultra-fast DEX capabilities make them popular picks. However, Web3Bay stands out by bringing blockchain into everyday use through decentralized commerce. Dubbed the “ Amazon of Web3 ,” Web3Bay’s presale offers early adopters the chance to secure 3BAY tokens before they rise in price. With its practical marketplace features and a focus on user rewards, Web3Bay has the potential to reshape online retail for good. As more crypto enthusiasts take notice, it could prove to be one of the most promising opportunities of 2025.

The altcoin leader’s decline comes amid heightened market volatility and uncertainty, with many investors reevaluating their positions following the recent selloff. However, despite the downturn, on-chain data suggests that underlying investor sentiment remains robust. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Major Deleveraging – Analyst Explains Price Crash Below $100K According to data from IntoTheBlock, Ethereum saw significant outflows from exchanges this week, with net outflows surpassing $1.4 billion—the highest level since November. Such activity often signals strong accumulation trends as investors move their holdings off exchanges and into cold storage or other wallets, indicative of long-term confidence in the asset. These substantial outflows underscore Ethereum’s resilience even amid challenging price action. Analysts are closely monitoring whether these accumulation trends can offset the bearish momentum and spark a recovery in the coming weeks. With Ethereum trading near critical support levels, the next moves will be pivotal in determining the direction of its price in 2025. As bullish seasonality for altcoins often kicks in during post-halving years, many believe that Ethereum could soon reclaim its upward trajectory, contingent on both market conditions and broader macroeconomic factors. Ethereum Prepares For Rebound Ethereum has shown signs of recovery after its recent drop, now attempting to break above the $3,300 level. The altcoin leader has faced considerable challenges, with a 15% decline from its recent highs putting pressure on bullish sentiment. However, key on-chain metrics indicate that Ethereum’s fundamentals remain strong, pointing toward potential growth in the coming months. Data from IntoTheBlock, shared on X, highlights a significant development: this week saw net $ETH outflows from exchanges exceeding $1.4 billion, the highest level since November. Such substantial outflows often signal that investors are moving their holdings off exchanges, a behavior typically associated with accumulation. This trend suggests that, despite recent bearish price action, confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential remains intact. While Ethereum’s recent price action may appear underwhelming to some, these accumulation trends provide a bullish underpinning for the asset. Historically, large exchange outflows have preceded significant price rallies, as reduced sell-side liquidity can drive upward momentum when demand increases.

As Ethereum works to reclaim higher levels, breaking above $3,300 could signal the beginning of a more sustained recovery. With strong fundamentals and growing investor confidence, Ethereum appears well-positioned for a potentially bullish 2025. However, the asset must navigate current market volatility to confirm its uptrend. Testing Weekly Demand Ethereum is trading at $3,250, reflecting ongoing struggles to break above the $3,300 resistance level. The price action remains tentative as ETH tests critical weekly demand levels. This area has historically provided strong support, and if Ethereum manages to close above the $3,100 mark, it could pave the way for a meaningful rebound in the coming days. The current consolidation phase highlights a market looking for direction. For bulls to regain control, Ethereum must break above key resistance levels. Reclaiming the $3,750 mark is crucial to confirm a bullish breakout and signal a potential uptrend. Such a move would not only restore investor confidence but also position ETH to retest higher levels as market sentiment shifts. However, failure to hold the $3,100 demand zone could lead to further downside pressure, with lower support levels likely to be tested. The coming sessions will be pivotal as Ethereum navigates these key levels. Related Reading: Key Metrics Reveal Bitcoin STH Support Levels Around $89K–$86K – Is BTC At Risk? With the broader market sentiment in flux, ETH’s ability to stay above its critical support zones will determine whether a bullish trend emerges or a prolonged consolidation phase persists.

This development coincided with the 16th anniversary of Bitcoin’s first-ever mention on Twitter, a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency history. Blockchain trackers have identified a series of large transactions involving unknown wallets and major exchanges, raising questions about the motive behind these significant transfers. $903 Million in Bitcoin Moves Across Wallets and Exchanges According to the data from the blockchain analytics service Whale Alert , there have been 10 large Bitcoin transactions in the last 24 hours with the total transaction amount of about 903 million BTC. The transfers primarily involved changing between addresses of unknown entities and cryptocurrency exchanges like Kraken, Binance and Robinhood. Among the largest ones, there were 620 BTC for $58.4 million, 888 BTC for $83.8 million, and 1,027 BTC for $96.7 million sent from Kraken to various unknown wallets. Also, 1,164 BTC or $109,700,000 was transferred between the wallets with unknown owners, and Robinhood sent 600 BTC or $56,800,000 to another unknown wallet. There was also much action on Binance as 999 BTC valued at $93.6 million was transferred from an unknown wallet. The same pattern continued with 1,881 BTC worth $176.5 million being sent to Kraken from other anonymous wallets. These movements have raised questions into whether the activity is related to sales, purchases or over the counter transactions. Potential Reasons Behind Bitcoin Transfers The cause of such a significant volatility of BTC price remains unknown, but there are several hypotheses. Transfers to exchanges like Kraken and Binance are usually a signal of the sellers while withdrawals to unidentified addresses could be a signal of accumulation. OTC trading can also be another possible reason because it enables buyers and sellers to transact large volumes of crypto without necessarily affecting the general market. Due to the fact that some of the wallets can be anonymous, it is difficult to establish the exact final intent for these transactions. Others have suggested that this could be due to some form of market positioning or potential future market event or institutional reallocation of assets. Nevertheless, without more information, the motives for these transfers are uncertain. BTC Marks 16th Anniversary of $0 Value Tweet The timing of these transactions coincides with Bitcoin’s 16th anniversary of its first-ever public mention. On January 11, 2009, Hal Finney, one of Bitcoin’s earliest supporters, tweeted, “Running Bitcoin.” This marked the cryptocurrency’s debut on social media and has since become a historic milestone in its journey from obscurity to global recognition. At the time, Bitcoin price was at $0, as adoption and utility were still in their infancy. Since then, Bitcoin’s price has risen dramatically, currently trading at $94,306. Although it remains far from Hal Finney’s long-term prediction of $10 million per coin, its progress continues to inspire confidence among investors. Bitcoin Price Rally Looming? At present, Bitcoin’s price is trading slightly below its recent all-time high (ATH) of $108,268, reached in December 2024. Despite this, analysts believe that the market remains in a bullish phase. On-chain data from Glassnode indicates that Bitcoin’s long-term holders are still in profit, with no significant loss-making among this group. As Bitcoin remains just over $94,000, some traders anticipate further price volatility in the near term. A correction to around $91,000 has been suggested as part of an Elliott Wave price analysis, but some forecasts predict that Bitcoin could reach as high as $210,000 before mid-February 2025.

Shiba Inu Bullish & INJ Resilient,https://thecoinrise.com/protect-your-shopping-experience-with-web3bay-580k-raised-in-presale-shiba-inu-bullish-inj-resilient/,"In the digital currency market, both well-established coins and emerging projects are marking their presence. The Shiba Inu market trend showcases a robust 14% increase in its value, pushing its market cap to $14 billion, although it faces potential hurdles from rising selling pressures. Similarly, Injective’s (INJ) performance is on the upswing with a 16% increase, spurred by a deflationary policy and the buoyant mood around Bitcoin’s growth. Amidst these financial waves, Web3 in e-commerce is carving out a niche as Web3Bay (3BAY) tackles increasing concerns about data privacy. In its third presale stage, having amassed over $580,000, Web3Bay fuses blockchain technology with e-commerce, crafting a decentralized marketplace that underscores security, transparency, and worldwide user accessibility. Shiba Inu Market Trend: A Look at Its Speculative Surge The Shiba Inu market trend has been in the spotlight recently due to a 14% rise in value over the past week, boosting its market cap to $14 billion. This upturn highlights a moderately bullish phase, with the RSI at 60.8, hinting at potential room for further growth. However, with decreasing ADX values and growing sell-offs, this upward trend might meet resistance. Analysts are eyeing a potential golden cross which could thrust Shiba Inu towards pivotal resistance levels at $0.0000298. Alternatively, an increase in bearish sentiments could guide the Shiba Inu market trend towards a consolidation phase, where crucial support levels at $0.000022 or $0.0000185 will be key in determining its next movements. INJ’s Performance: Deflationary Tactics & BTC’s Ascent Injective’s performance is commendable, with a 16% surge reinforced by strategic enhancements in its ecosystem and enthusiasm over Bitcoin’s potential rise to $100,000. INJ’s price escalated to $26.33, paired with a substantial 127.27% increase in trading volume, highlighting heightened market activity and growing investor interest. Central to this surge is Injective’s proposed 3.0 governance model, designed to amplify its deflationary mechanism through streamlined token burns and staking incentives, reducing overall supply. This strategy aims to reinforce INJ’s value in the crypto market as it strives to regain its peak of $52.75. Web3Bay: Pioneering a Secure Path in E-commerce The 2023 MOVEit data breach shed light on the critical vulnerabilities within centralized e-commerce platforms, sparking a demand for more secure and transparent shopping alternatives. Traditional online shopping platforms not only lack in protecting user data but also impose heavy fees, which can stifle small business growth. Web3Bay (3BAY) is addressing these critical issues by merging blockchain technology with e-commerce, ensuring a secure and reliable space for users to conduct transactions online. Now in its third presale stage, the 3BAY token is available at just $0.0039675. So far, the presale has successfully raised over $580,000 and seen more than 160 million tokens purchased. With projections pointing to a price of $0.1959 at launch, early investors could see an impressive 6430% return on investment. By leveraging web3 in e-commerce , Web3Bay eliminates middlemen, offering worldwide access, faster transactions, and enhanced security for personal data. It’s a platform that not only prioritizes transparency but also reaches out to the underbanked, ensuring an inclusive shopping experience. Both traders and consumers are drawn to Web3Bay’s revolutionary model, which promises to reshape online marketplaces and offers significant potential returns for its early backers. With ongoing reports of data breaches, Web3Bay is increasingly recognized as a dependable option for secure and efficient online shopping. Embrace the Future of E-commerce with Web3Bay While the Shiba Inu market trend and Injective’s performance garner attention, Web3Bay is making significant strides in redefining e-commerce through blockchain. Shiba Inu’s notable rise reflects its growing appeal, and Injective continues to impress with its substantial gains, fueled by deflationary policies and Bitcoin’s momentum. Simultaneously, Web3Bay is tackling critical issues such as data privacy and secure online transactions head-on. With significant funding and an impressive number of 3BAY tokens sold, Web3Bay is establishing new benchmarks for Web3 in e-commerce. At the current presale price, investors have the opportunity to partake in what could be a transformative force in the fusion of cryptocurrency and online commerce.

In contrast, Litecoin’s future value remains uncertain as it struggles to recover from a 40% decline from its December high of $147.22. Amid these developments, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making significant strides with its modern GHOSTDAG technology and the aggressive LAUNCH300 campaign, which provides a 300% bonus on BDAG purchases.

BlockDAG Projects for $1 as LAUNCH300 Offers Goes Viral! BlockDAG Network (BDAG) has been vigorously marketing since its debut, quickly amassing over 170,000 holders in a few months. The Layer 1 project has remained in the limelight, gaining momentum as it nears its mainnet launch. A key highlight is the LAUNCH300 campaign, providing a significant 300% bonus on BDAG purchases. Often referred to as a Kaspa Killer, the initiative is prompting optimistic price forecasts, with some analysts suggesting it might reach $1 by 2025. BlockDAG continues to exceed expectations in various areas. Its rapid transaction capability of 10 blocks per second has attracted crypto experts and enthusiasts, and swift advancements toward mainnet development have supported a prosperous presale, accumulating over $179 million worldwide. With plans for establishing a Swiss foundation, allocating grants, and enhancing a low-code/no-code platform, BlockDAG’s path forward looks bright. With BDAG priced at $0.0248 during the presale, and enthusiasts eagerly utilizing the LAUNCH300 code, the project is seen as a promising long-term prospect. Will LTC Climb to $184 or Decline Further? The future price of Litecoin is currently uncertain as it trades below the crucial $110 resistance level. Following a significant 120% rally in late 2024, Litecoin faced challenges in sustaining its growth, with a 40% drop from its December high of $147.22. Despite these setbacks, LTC has consistently found support at its descending resistance trend line, hinting at a possible recovery. Neutral readings from technical indicators such as the RSI and MACD show no definitive signs of a bullish surge or continued downfall. The wave analysis indicates that Litecoin could be approaching its fifth upward wave, aiming for $184 based on Fibonacci retracement levels. However, the movement around the $110 mark will be crucial in defining its long-term trajectory. Until a definitive trend is established, predictions for Litecoin’s price will continue to balance cautious optimism with prevailing uncertainty. SUI’s Record High: Will It Reach $6.60? SUI’s price trajectory has been remarkable, reaching a new all-time high of $5.35, marking a 20% increase in just ten days and surpassing major altcoins such as Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. SUI has been trading within a bullish channel pattern since November 2024, supported by strong technical indicators like the RSI and SMA. The project has now exceeded $2 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL), with 69.75% of its supply locked, suggesting it is still undervalued. If the current bullish trend persists, SUI might challenge its recent high again and target a new milestone at $6.60. Conversely, a downward turn could see its price drop to significant support levels near $4.50. SUI continues to be a strong candidate for long-term growth, drawing sustained interest with its robust performance. Final Say As we look towards 2025, Sui, Litecoin, and BlockDAG each offer distinct prospects in the crypto market. SUI’s recent all-time high of $5.35 and its impressive $2 billion TVL underscore its potential to climb towards $6.60. Meanwhile, Litecoin’s prospects remain mixed as it strives to overcome the $110 resistance and aim for $184, underpinned by crucial technical support. On the other hand, BlockDAG is rapidly emerging with its cutting-edge GHOSTDAG protocol and swift transaction capabilities, enhanced by the LAUNCH300 campaign’s success, which has led to a $179 million crypto presale achievement. For those looking to diversify their holdings, the upward trends of Sui, the potential recovery of Litecoin, and the pioneering technology of BlockDAG present compelling opportunities.

This article highlights the top 4 crypto wallets for 2025: Plus Wallet, Binance Web3 Wallet, Uniswap Wallet, and SafePal Wallet. Each of these wallets offers top-tier security and a range of advanced features, such as hardware wallet integration, lightning-fast token listings, and earning opportunities. This in-depth guide will help users evaluate the benefits of each wallet, making it easier for users to choose the top crypto wallet for securing assets and grabbing profitable opportunities in the year ahead. 1. Plus Wallet: Maximize Gains and Minimize Effort Plus Wallet has secured its place among the top 4 crypto wallets today with its efficiency, security, and earning opportunities. One standout feature is its quick 15-minute token listings, where new tokens are live on the platform within just 15 minutes. This allows traders to engage with fresh options and seize potential opportunities as soon as they launch. In addition, Plus Wallet offers a unique Swap to Earn feature where users earn rewards for every single trade they make.

With no limits on swaps or referrals, this creates a simple and steady, passive income opportunity for users that requires no extra effort, just regular trading. All of this is supported by strong security, a user-friendly interface, and advanced tools designed to streamline users’ trading experience. This combination of speed, security, and gains makes Plus Wallet the best among the top 4 crypto wallets for 2025. 2. Binance Web3: The Trusted Crypto Wallet Binance Web3 Wallet offers strong support for multiple cryptocurrencies, allowing users to manage different assets in one place. It's known for security features and includes SegWit and Bech32 address options, adding flexibility. The wallet also has built-in exchange functionality, allowing users to easily swap assets. As part of Binance, one of the most trusted names in crypto, it provides an added layer of reliability. However, it may not be the best choice for beginners due to its complexity, and customer support could be improved. Additionally, users who prioritize complete decentralization might prefer alternatives, given its connection to a centralized exchange. 3. Uniswap Wallet: Easy Ethereum Swaps Uniswap Wallet, available as a mobile app and Chrome extension, provides a straightforward user experience with a built-in swap function that mirrors the Uniswap web interface. This feature allows users to easily swap tokens within the wallet without a learning curve. The wallet also includes a “Buy” function, enabling users to purchase popular cryptocurrencies using various payment methods, through third-party processors with associated fees. Mobile app users can connect to any DApp through browsers without needing additional extensions. However, Uniswap Wallet is limited to Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens, which may restrict its use for other blockchain assets. 4. SafePal: The Reliable Cold and Hot Wallet Option SafePal is a multi-platform wallet offering robust security features, including an app, a browser extension, and a cold wallet option. It supports cross-chain swaps and spot trading, allowing users to buy crypto with credit or debit cards. The wallet is compatible with thousands of coins and tokens and includes NFT storage. However, some users have raised concerns about the security of the S1 hardware wallet, especially considering its price of $49.99. While the wallet offers value, it's essential to weigh the price against potential security risks for those considering its use. Find Your Best Fit Among the Top 4 Crypto Wallets Each of these wallets offers distinct benefits, making them the top four crypto wallets for 2025. SafePal Wallet is ideal for users looking for a versatile option, offering both hardware and software solutions. However, there have been some complaints about the hardware model in the past. Uniswap Wallet is a great pick for those holding Ethereum-based assets, offering a versatile platform tailored to this ecosystem. Binance Web3 Wallet stands out for its advanced security features, ensuring asset protection for users. Finally, Plus Wallet earns its spot as number one among the top 4 wallets for 2025 , thanks to its rapid token listings, strong security, and unlimited rewards—all available through a simple and intuitive mobile app. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

PropiChain and SUI tokens are suitable alternatives traders are looking up to due to their unique AI integration. Experts further state that PCHAIN has the potential to deliver 30,000x in the coming weeks due to its RWA impact. Below we will discuss the XRP price action resistance and why SUI and PropiChain serve as an alternative to investors. Why traders are considering PropiChain and SUI as the XRP Price alternatives After an incredible rally late last year, the XRP price has failed to go above $2.5 for some days now. Although it had over 6% growth in the last 7 days, regardless, the XRP price has been hovering around $2.3, and the total market cap dropped by 5% to $133.98B. This has got some traders on the lookout for alternatives. SUI is among the hottest projects at the moment and it keeps trying to gain momentum. The project recently announced its plans to integrate AI to enhance its efficiency and security. SUI’s plan to integrate AI and the recent rally the project had positioned it as a great alternative for traders as the XRP price action loses momentum. Also, experts believe PropiChain , a crypto AI project that aims to revolutionize the real estate sector is a great alternative as the XRP price action keeps facing resistance. This project is a decentralized real estate marketplace that offers solutions to the primitive issues in the sector. This token has been gaining traction and a massive inflow of investors, which is evident from the success of its first presale round, where the project raised more than $1.3 million. The project has now crossed $2 million from presale and it is not slowing down. Investors are taking advantage of the discounted entry price of $0.011 in the second presale round to position for the potential 30,000x ROI. Many tipped this token to dominate the real estate and AI market. CoinMarketCap has listed the project which added to its visibility, and audits from BlockAudit boost traders’ confidence in the project. PropiChain Will Dominate Real Estate With its AI Offerings and Other Features PropiChain’s increasing traction and speedy token presale stages are due to its connection to the multi-trillion industry. With its decentralized marketplace, PCHAIN plans to make real estate better via innovations and this helps it edge SUI. Some of the benefits expected when PropiChain is launched include: Advanced Property Filtering PCHAIN’s artificial intelligence will help investors in real estate with property filtering and recommendations quicker and better. This PropiChain innovation will go beyond basic search criteria and employ advanced filters to improve efficiency and investors. For instance, investors can use prompts like possible growth and expected ROI to search for suitable assets. Asides from filtering, PropiChain AI can recommend properties to investors based on their previous searches. Predictive Market Insights Investors need all the help they can get to make profitable decisions. PropiChain marketplace offers this by using AI to appraise market situations and historical statistics. The vast statistics that will be available on this decentralized platform are far beyond the ones mediators reach in the conventional real estate market. The AI will evaluate market trends, property values, and investment opportunities, and this will enhance the predictions’ accuracy and result in strategic investment decision-making for investors. Accurate Property Valuation Getting accurate coats of assets has been a major concern for real estate investors. Overpricing, underpricing, and additional costs imposed by brokers and agents are common concerns. However, with PCHAIN’s AI, getting the actual cost of the property will be easier. This is because the AI will use the vast available information, both historical and present, to calculate real-time prices. PropiChain ’s AI will also take over most intermediary roles to save costs and stress. This also promotes efficiency in the trillion-dollar marketplace. Fractional Ownership PropiChain aims to make real estate more inclusive by breaking the barriers hindering investors. Since its inception, the industry has been reserved for wealthy investors because not everyone can afford huge entry capital or costly mortgages. However, with the real estate fractional ownership model that PropiChain offers, property acquisition will now be easier for investors. For instance, you can pay as low as $1000 for a portion of assets that is worth $650,000 to $700,000 while other investors contribute the remaining capital. Conclusion With the resistance faced by the XRP price, it is wise for investors to find alternatives. PropiChain comes to mind not only because it aims at improving the trillion-dollar industry but also because of its AI integration, which is the sought-after narrative in the crypto market. PropiChain is currently going for $0.011 at the second presale phase, and this is the lowest entry investors will get because the entry price will increase in the third round, and it will rally from there. An investment of $1000 could potentially yield more than 8 figures profit for investors. The XRP price faces its challenges; however, SUI and PropiChain serve as the beacon of hope for investors and Ripple traders are determined to harness the AI-driven insights of PropiChain for smarter, faster, and more secure real estate transactions.

The scam involved a post that read, “LTC is now in Solana,” The hacker wrote a now-deleted and grammatically incorrect post featuring a contract address and a pump.fun link to the scam token. The Litecoin team later announced that they had resolved the matter. They noted that they were now in control of the account and said the attack was due to a compromised delegated account that had since been deleted. Hackers are increasingly targeting social media accounts to promote fake tokens Hacking social media accounts to promote fake projects or tokens is common among crypto-criminals. The Litecoin incident is the latest in a series of high-profile X account hacks targeting organizations and individuals to promote fake tokens and phishing schemes. These scams aim to steal funds and sensitive user data, underscoring the need for heightened cybersecurity measures. In October, Andy Ayrey, Truth Terminal’s founder’s X account, was attacked. The hacker used the access to promote a token called “IB” and walked away with $600 million in net profit. During the same month, Restaking protocol, EigenLayer’s X account was hacked to promote a fake airdrop campaign. The hacker posted several malicious links from the account, advertising the “Season 2 Stakedrop,” which they falsely claimed was sourced from reallocated EIGEN tokens before the EigenLayer team regained control. At the beginning of November, rapper Wiz Khalifa’s account was also compromised. The hacker took the opportunity to promote a fake celebrity memecoin called ‘WIZ’ on the account. The threat actor linked the token with the musical artist. Hackers target Cardano Foundation and Animoca Brands On December 8 Cardano Foundation’s X account was also compromised, with attackers posting false information about an alleged SEC lawsuit and promoting a fraudulent token (ADAsol).

Elon Buys Solana (ELONBSOL), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Buys Solana launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 85b1Mza2zF6SDGXZURjeu53wdapN6W1UjFC4PAqhKE8k – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBSOL.

These quirky tokens, born from internet culture, have a way of capturing the imagination and wallets of investors. From the early days of Dogecoin to the wild ride of Shiba Inu, these coins have shown that sometimes, the biggest returns come from the most unexpected places. Now, if you think you’ve missed the Bonk party, hold up! BTFD Coin is stepping into the spotlight, and it’s shaping up to be one of the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. With a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, a killer referral program, and staking rewards offering a whopping 90% APY, BTFD Coin is ready to take meme coin popularity to new heights. What sets BTFD Coin apart is not just its meme-worthy branding but the actual utility it brings to the table. Launched in a presale that’s already raised over $5.1 million, BTFD Coin has captured the interest of over 8,100 holders, affectionately known as “Bulls.” The excitement surrounding its features is palpable. With the P2E game going live on January 1, 2025, and staking rewards that promise impressive returns, BTFD Coin is not just riding the wave of meme coin hype; it’s creating its own tidal wave. So, as we dive into this article, let’s explore how BTFD Coin stacks up against Bonk. We’ll break down the latest developments, analyst predictions, and what makes BTFD Coin the standout choice for anyone looking to invest in the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. Buckle up, because we’re about to uncover why this could be one of the smartest moves you make this year. BTFD Coin: The Future of Meme Coins BTFD Coin has exploded onto the scene and is making waves that are hard to ignore. With its presale currently in the 13th stage at a price of $0.000142, the coin has already sold over 63 billion tokens. That’s no small feat! As of January 10, 2025, the presale has brought in a staggering $5.1 million, showing that investors are keen on what BTFD has to offer. But what’s all the fuss about? One of the standout features of BTFD Coin is its Play-to-Earn game , which launched on January 1, 2025. Imagine diving into a game that not only entertains you but also rewards you in crypto. Players can earn while they play, making it a fun way to engage with the community and build wealth simultaneously. Talk about a win-win! And let’s not forget the staking aspect. BTFD Coin offers an incredible 90% APY on staking, which is practically unheard of in this space. If you’re thinking about passive income, this is where you want to be. On December 2, staking went live, and investors have been flocking to get in on the action. The referral program is the cherry on top. Invite your friends, and you can earn rewards together. The more, the merrier, right? Now, think about this: if you invested $20,000 when the presale started at just $0.000004, you’d snag an impressive 5 billion BTFD coins.

This substantial purchase comes amid Dogecoin’s bullish recovery in key metrics, as analysts project a significant push to the upside. Dogecoin Whales Buy 470 Million DOGE Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed on X (formerly Twitter) on January 11 that Dogecoin whales have begun accumulating again. Martinez announced the latest DOGE acquisition by these deep-pocketed investors, highlighting that Whales recently bought over 470 million tokens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Unravels 157-Day Fractal Similar To Last Cycle, Why A Surge To $169,000 Is Possible This substantial DOGE purchase, which occurred in the last 48 hours, is valued at approximately 155 million based on current market prices. Such large-scale whale activity often signals a renewed interest in the cryptocurrency, potentially influencing market sentiment and trends. Martinez shared a chart presenting data related to Dogecoin, focusing on the behavior of whales holding assets spanning from 10 million to 100 million DOGE. The shaded area on the chart highlights the cumulative holdings of these wallets owning millions of DOGE. Around late December 2024, Dogecoin whale holdings were relatively stable but began increasing significantly in early January 2025. CEO, a crypto analyst on X, commented on this surging accumulation trend, highlighting that whales have purchased over 1 billion Dogecoin in the last seven days. Martinez’s chart also shows that large amounts of Dogecoin were purchased between $0.314 and $0.355. These prices highlight areas where Dogecoin experienced notable volatility and a slight pullback, presenting a buying opportunity for investors. Dogecoin previously surged to new highs above $0.4 in 2024. However, a steep correction pushed its price back towards the $0.3 mark. Interestingly, the 470 million Dogecoin purchased by whales comes as the cryptocurrency experiences a steady bullish recovery in significant metrics. Crypto analyst Javon Marks disclosed that Dogecoin is forming a new Descending Wedge pattern. Additionally, a market expert on X, identified as ‘Rose Premium Signals,’ has revealed that Dogecoin’s macro charts are signaling a strong bullish structure as it accumulates near key support zones and aligns with long-term Fibonacci levels. DOGE Forms New Descending Wedge Pattern As mentioned earlier, Dogecoin is currently forming a new Descending Wedge pattern, signaling another potential price breakout. Marks stated in his X post that the popular meme coin is well positioned to continue another substantial bullish trend once it breaks out of this Descending Wedge pattern. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin’s 30% Decline A Chance To Buy On Discount? Here Is the Pertinent Level To Watch A Descending Wedge, also known as a Falling Wedge, is a technical chart pattern that indicates the potential for a price reversal or continuation. It is a bullish pattern that typically occurs during a downtrend, with its completion marked by a breakout above the upper trendline. Marks predicts that if Dogecoin breaks above the Descending Wedge pattern, it could hit a new ATH soon, reflecting a potential 120% increase. The analyst has revealed that this massive price gain could happen anytime soon, pushing Dogecoin from its current market price of $$0.33 to a new bullish target of $0.739.

This allows early backers to support a project and potentially benefit from lower prices and exclusive perks. It offers a chance to contribute to the project’s goals while possibly earning rewards. For the developers, presales provide essential funding to develop their technology, grow their user base, and enhance community involvement. It helps attract a dedicated group of early users who provide valuable input for future improvements. Web3Bay: Facilitating Easier Crypto Transactions Web3Bay distinguishes itself by integrating regular online payment methods like PayPal and credit cards with blockchain. Unlike typical blockchain platforms that only accept crypto, Web3Bay offers more payment flexibility. This inclusive approach invites newcomers to the blockchain by allowing them to sell items and accept payments in fiat or digital currencies. This flexibility caters to various user comfort levels, encouraging more people to explore decentralized commerce. Some users may prefer traditional payment methods, while others may delve deeper into Web3 functionalities. Web3Bay’s integration of both payment worlds aims to broaden user adoption across its platform. Web3Bay Embraces Decentralized Governance Web3Bay plans to evolve into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), where control is spread across its user base. Token holders have the power to propose and decide on changes to the platform. This democratic approach allows for a diverse range of ideas and promotes transparency, as all proposals and voting outcomes are recorded on the blockchain. Although larger stakeholders have more influence, the goal is to keep the platform equitable for all participants. By involving users in decision-making, Web3Bay nurtures loyalty and cooperative development, contrasting with conventional centralized governance models. Scaling Decentralized Commerce for Efficient Transactions To manage numerous transactions efficiently, Web3Bay incorporates Layer-2 solutions that handle transactions off the main chain. This setup lowers transaction costs and increases processing speed. The use of auto-scaling servers ensures the platform performs well during peak usage, adjusting resources dynamically to maintain speed and reduce costs. Why Consider Web3Bay’s Crypto Presale? Web3Bay’s presale provides an opportunity for early backers to purchase tokens that are crucial for a widely applicable marketplace. The platform has impressively amassed over $580,000 rapidly, advancing to its third presale phase with tokens priced at $0.0039675. Unlike purely speculative tokens, these offer genuine utility in both the transactions and governance aspects of the platform. Early participants not only potentially benefit from an increase in token value but also acquire the ability to influence decisions through voting. This active involvement allows the community to directly shape the development of future partnerships, enhancements, and policy modifications. The presale targets users interested in a system that combines the ease of Web2 with the innovations of Web3. Despite inherent risks like possible delays or market volatility, Web3Bay stands out by integrating practical commerce applications. Interested buyers are encouraged to conduct thorough research, as the potential advantages include contributing to a marketplace that supports both fiat and digital currencies. Summarizing the Appeal of Web3Bay’s Approach Understanding the mechanics of a crypto presale is crucial to appreciating what Web3Bay offers. By incorporating conventional payment methods, empowering community governance, and ensuring robust infrastructure, the platform appeals to both traditional and cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Participants can engage in purchases using either fiat or digital currencies and progressively immerse themselves in governance and staking opportunities. This strategy simplifies the transition to decentralized commerce, making it more accessible and less daunting for newcomers. However, it remains vital for potential participants to assess the project’s trajectory and current market trends. Should Web3Bay achieve its objectives, it could exemplify the successful fusion of standard e-commerce frameworks with blockchain innovations. For those seeking convenience coupled with new opportunities, this presale offers a chance to get involved at an early stage and help shape a marketplace designed to be inclusive and responsive to all user contributions. Web3Bay’s Expanded Vision: A Community-Centric Marketplace Web3Bay’s strategy encompasses inclusive access, user-driven governance, and adaptable technology. By participating in the presale, early adopters gain the opportunity to guide the platform’s evolution through governance rights and impact updates directly. As the project matures, it is expected that user feedback will drive the introduction of new partnerships and the expansion of offerings, such as additional payment options and broader product categories. This method of transparent governance distributes responsibility among its users, fostering a deeper sense of ownership that transcends the traditional consumer-seller model. Web3Bay aspires to redefine the online marketplace by prioritizing user engagement, enhancing operational efficiency, and lowering the hurdles to entry. For those eager to participate in a system that combines the ease of Web2 with the innovations of Web3, Web3Bay’s presale presents a distinct chance to contribute to the next generation of e-commerce .

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 01:40:00

Meanwhile, the Avalanche (AVAX) ecosystem continues to shine, recording $17.7 billion in swap volume and showcasing its growing influence in DeFi and beyond. But all eyes are on BlockDAG , whose early 2025 mainnet launch will be a game-changer. With plans to list on 10 top exchanges, the enhanced liquidity and accessibility are set to drive the coin’s value higher, solidifying its potential as 2025’s next big crypto. Ethereum Upgrade ‘Serenity’ Sparks Market Optimism in 2025 The Ethereum upgrade, dubbed “Serenity,” marks a pivotal advancement for the blockchain network, focusing on improved scalability, security, and energy efficiency. This milestone transition to a proof-of-stake mechanism drastically reduces energy consumption, a move welcomed by both environmental advocates and crypto enthusiasts. The enhanced transaction speed and lower fees are expected to appeal to developers and users alike, particularly as smart contract functionalities become more robust. Market reactions to the Ethereum upgrade have been overwhelmingly positive, with its price surging by 12% in just two days. This progress cements Ethereum’s status as a frontrunner in blockchain innovation. Avalanche (AVAX) Ecosystem Surpasses $17.7 Billion in Swap Volume The Avalanche (AVAX) ecosystem continues to demonstrate its scalability and efficiency, recording $17.7 billion in swap volume across 4.8 million transactions over 90 days. With 454,000 unique participants driving this activity, the ecosystem’s decentralised applications (dApps) are proving highly effective in meeting diverse user needs. Notable trends include the dominance of WAVAX in swap volume and USDC as the most frequently used stablecoin, highlighting the versatility of the Avalanche (AVAX) ecosystem for both high-value traders and retail users. This surge in activity underscores the network’s role in supporting innovative projects, fostering adoption across DeFi, NFTs, and community-driven tokens. 2025 Mainnet Launch: BlockDAG’s Big Leap in the Crypto Space The early 2025 mainnet launch of BlockDAG is more than a technological upgrade—it’s a defining moment for the project’s trajectory. By combining scalability, high performance, and a vision for decentralised financial systems, this milestone marks BlockDAG’s entry into the upper echelons of blockchain networks. With its advanced infrastructure, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a serious contender for the next big crypto, capturing the attention of blockchain enthusiasts and analysts alike. The launch is anticipated to establish new benchmarks, enhancing its appeal to both developers and traders in an increasingly competitive space. In preparation for this transformative launch, BlockDAG has announced plans to list its BDAG coins on ten top tier-two and tier-three exchanges. This strategy paves the way for broader access, fostering greater liquidity and adoption across global markets. Such moves ensure the network’s ecosystem remains dynamic and accessible, giving it the momentum needed to meet its ambitious goals. BDAG’s growing presence on these platforms is expected to unlock new opportunities, driving interest from a diverse audience of retail and institutional participants. BlockDAG’s journey is just beginning, but its achievements so far set the tone for an exciting future. With its record-breaking presale hitting over $179 million and the coin’s value already soaring 2380%, BDAG’s potential seems boundless. Analysts predict its price could climb to $1 this year, fueled by the mainnet launch and exchange listings. These developments are more than milestones—they’re stepping stones toward cementing BlockDAG’s place in the blockchain world. Missing out on BlockDAG could mean watching 2025’s next big crypto from the sidelines. The Bottom Line: Why 2025 is Crypto’s Next Era The crypto industry is entering an exciting phase as projects push boundaries in 2025. Ethereum’s Serenity upgrade has sparked renewed interest, setting the stage for a greener, faster, and more efficient network. Avalanche (AVAX) continues to impress with its ecosystem’s $17.7 billion in swap volume, demonstrating its appeal to a diverse range of users. But the boldest moves come from BlockDAG. With its early 2025 mainnet launch and upcoming exchange listings, BlockDAG is shaping up to be a frontrunner. Analysts are already predicting exponential value growth for BDAG, and those who act now may secure a front-row seat in this unfolding success story.

BitTorrent Chain ($BTTC) has ignited discussions with its target of reaching $5 by 2025. In contrast, Stacks, a key Bitcoin Layer 2 network, encountered a five-hour disruption that paused transactions. In this landscape, Web3Bay (3BAY) has positioned itself as a noteworthy new web3 blockchain initiative. With an anticipated return on investment of 6,430%, the platform’s presale has quickly attracted a significant following. Already, Web3Bay has secured $580K and distributed over 160 million coins. As it progresses, the platform aims to offer a novel approach to blockchain investment. BitTorrent Price Target: Can $5 Be Reached by 2025? The possibility of BitTorrent Chain ($BTTC) achieving a $5 price target within the next couple of years has stirred much debate among crypto enthusiasts. This target hinges on the platform’s growth trajectory within the expanding Web3 framework. $BTTC is establishing itself as an essential element of decentralized infrastructure with its decentralized applications and peer-to-peer sharing features. Nevertheless, reaching this price milestone will require overcoming substantial challenges, including its large circulating supply, which demands significant market demand or strategic token burns. Stacks News: A Brief Interruption for the Layer 2 Network Stacks, a prominent Bitcoin Layer 2 solution, recently faced a five-hour outage, halting its block production temporarily. This incident, caused by decreased signer activity, has brought to light the scalability challenges of blockchain networks. In response, Stacks mobilized its developers to work closely with the signers, ensuring a quick resolution. This event occurred shortly after the Nakamoto Upgrade, aimed at increasing transaction speeds and enhancing network security. Despite the upgrade’s potential, the recent downtime exposed some ongoing issues with network capacity. Notably, this happened as Stacks announced that its total BTC supply had topped 1,000, a sign of its expanding reach. 6430% ROI Opportunity—Web3Bay’s Attractive Pricing! Web3Bay (3BAY) is reshaping the future of e-commerce with a groundbreaking platform that fully embraces blockchain technology. This initiative not only makes buying and selling straightforward but also integrates the use of digital assets in daily transactions. What makes Web3Bay standout is its commitment to ensuring that all dealings are secure, clear, and outside the grip of any central authority. The early success of Web3Bay’s presale, which has already generated $580,000 and moved over 160 million tokens, underscores the growing interest from investors. As the price of 3BAY tokens is poised to climb with each presale stage, now presents a strategic time to get involved. Investors jumping on board today will not only benefit from lower prices but are also likely to see higher returns as the project scales up. With an anticipated ROI of 6430%, Web3Bay offers a unique opportunity for those looking to get in early on an innovative web3 blockchain venture. As demand surges and the supply of tokens dwindles, the chance to join this innovative venture at a favorable price is rapidly closing. As Web3Bay garners more attention within the crypto world, early adopters will find themselves well-placed in a project primed for significant expansion. Closing Thoughts The cryptocurrency sector is filled with potential yet accompanied by considerable challenges. BitTorrent’s $5 price goal is ambitious, facing obstacles from competitors and market dynamics. Likewise, Stacks has dealt with operational issues that highlight the intricate demands of scaling blockchain technologies. Amid these developments, Web3Bay shines as a promising web3 blockchain project. Its successful presale has raised substantial funds and distributed millions of tokens at a compelling price of $0.0039675. With a projected ROI of 6430%, Web3Bay presents a unique chance for early investors to capitalize on before prices climb further.

Despite this setback, the meme coin leader still maintains a bullish structure, holding above a crucial demand zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Major Deleveraging – Analyst Explains Price Crash Below $100K Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared compelling on-chain data, revealing that whales have been actively accumulating DOGE during this downturn. In the last 48 hours alone, over 470 million DOGE tokens have been acquired by large holders, suggesting confidence in the asset’s potential recovery and long-term value. This significant accumulation indicates strong institutional and whale interest, even as the broader market remains uncertain. Dogecoin’s resilience at current levels reflects its ability to capture investor attention, especially during volatile periods. With the broader market searching for direction, DOGE’s ability to maintain its bullish structure could pave the way for a substantial rebound. Dogecoin Prepares For A Big Move Dogecoin is demonstrating resilience as it holds firm above the $0.33 mark, despite a notable drop from its recent local highs. This level has become a key demand zone for the meme coin, serving as a foundation for potential recovery and upward momentum. Market analysts and investors are closely monitoring DOGE’s price action, anticipating a continuation of its upward trend, as expectations for a strong rally this year grow. Martinez recently highlighted compelling on-chain data on X, revealing that whales have accumulated over 470 million DOGE within the last 48 hours. This surge in whale activity during a period of price consolidation underscores a growing confidence among large holders in Dogecoin’s long-term prospects. Historically, such accumulation has often been a precursor to significant price movements, as institutional and high-net-worth investors position themselves for the next big move. Related Reading: Key Metrics Reveal Bitcoin STH Support Levels Around $89K–$86K – Is BTC At Risk? The bullish whale activity adds a layer of optimism for Dogecoin, even as the broader market navigates through a period of uncertainty. With smart money actively accumulating, DOGE appears to be in a strategic accumulation phase, setting the stage for a potential breakout. If this trend continues, Dogecoin could attract renewed retail interest and reclaim higher levels, further solidifying its position as one of the most-watched assets in the crypto space. Price Analysis: Key Supply Levels Dogecoin is trading at $0.33, showing resilience as it holds above the critical $0.31 demand level despite recent market volatility. This support zone has provided a solid foundation, but the price continues to face significant resistance in its path to recovery. Every day that DOGE remains below the $0.40 mark increases the risk of a deeper correction, putting pressure on bulls to reclaim higher levels to sustain the bullish structure. For Dogecoin to regain momentum and inspire confidence among investors, the price must break above the $0.40 mark and hold it as support. This level is a key psychological and technical barrier, and reclaiming it would signal strength, encouraging further buying pressure. Beyond $0.40, the $0.43 mark becomes the next critical target. A breakout above this level would pave the way for Dogecoin to enter price discovery mode, potentially reaching new highs.

However, with recent whale activity and strong demand at current levels, Dogecoin has the potential to reverse its downtrend and resume its upward trajectory. The coming days will be crucial as the market watches for a decisive move.

While Bitcoin continues to hold its position as the dominant force, altcoins are showing strong growth potential. From the well-established Ethereum (ETH) to the emerging BIG BOSS INU, these digital assets are set for significant gains. Investors are closely watching these top picks, as they are likely to surge before the market truly takes off. BIG BOSS INU’s Presale: A Promising Start in Crypto BIG BOSS INU is making waves in the crypto world, with its presale launch drawing considerable attention from investors. The project is positioned as a high-reward opportunity for those who get in early. Interest around its presale is rapidly increasing, making BIG BOSS INU one of the most watched cryptos at the end of 2024. With cutting-edge features and a bold development roadmap, BIG BOSS INU is poised to see significant growth in the coming months. >>>>>> Ethereum (ETH) has gained momentum after the successful implementation of the Dencun upgrade, which significantly reduced transaction fees on Layer-2 networks. This development is expected to drive broader adoption of Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dApps), though analysts are cautious about a potential short-term price correction. Currently, ETH is stabilizing around $3,350. Polygon (MATIC) saw strong gains, benefiting from Ethereum’s upgrade, with prices rising by 8-10% prior to the event. If buying pressure continues, MATIC could potentially rise to $2, although it faces some resistance near the $0.47 mark. TRON (TRX) has maintained its solid market position, with steady interest from investors. Though it has seen slight fluctuations, TRX remains a key player in the crypto space, with traders closely watching its performance. >>> Arbitrum (ARB) has also surged following the Ethereum upgrade, gaining around 6% over the last 24 hours. ARB may continue upward, with a potential target of $0.7, though it faces resistance at $0.75. Conclusion : As Bitcoin approaches $150K, altcoins like BigBossInu, Ethereum, Polygon, TRON, and Arbitrum are positioned for strong gains. BIG BOSS INU’s promising presale, Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade, and the growth of Polygon and Arbitrum highlight their potential. With the market rallying, these cryptos could see substantial returns by 2025. Always research carefully and consider risks in the volatile crypto market.

With XRP benefiting from favorable developments, Solana maintaining its position as a leading blockchain platform, and the new altcoin offering early-stage growth potential, 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for these projects. Ripple (XRP) Surge on Legal and Market Tailwinds Ripple’s new rise in price has caused fresh interest in the crypto, pushed by good news in its law fights and more big firms getting on board. XRP has made itself a top pick for cross-border payments because of its quick transaction times and small costs, which have drawn deals with money groups worldwide. Main ͏reasons for XRP’s rise are better legal clarity, with new court decisions giving a brighter view for Ripple and lessening rule doubts. Also, banks and money groups are more and more using Ripple’s payment tools, which has raised need for XRP. Fresh trust from buyers has also helped to lift XRP’s price, making it one of the best stars in start of 2025. With its strong utility and regulatory progress, analysts anticipate that XRP’s momentum could lead to further price increases in the months ahead. Solana (SOL) Eyeing $600 in 2025 Analysts predict that SOL could reach a price range of $260 to $600 by 2025, driven by its increasing adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). A cup-and-handle pattern identified on the weekly chart indicates the potential for a price surge to $600, with an extended bull cycle target of approximately $1,827. Additionally, Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has reached $9.215 billion, setting a new all-time high and reflecting growing momentum in the DeFi sector. Moreover, Solana has surpassed Ethereum in attracting new developers, with 7,625 developers joining its ecosystem in 2024, positioning it as the leading ecosystem for developer growth this year. These developments collectively support an optimistic outlook for Solana’s price trajectory in the coming years. New Altcoin Gaining Investor Interest While projects like Ripple and Solana often steal the spotlight, Lightchain AI is quietly emerging as a favorite among savvy investors. Positioned at an early-stage price, Lightchain AI combines cutting-edge innovation with real-world practicality. Its affordability offers significant growth potential for those looking to invest early. What sets Lightchain AI apart is its strong emphasis on real-world applications, making it more than just another speculative token. As adoption rises and interest surges, momentum is quickly building around this promising project. With predictions of exponential growth, Lightchain AI presents a high-risk, high-reward opportunity that could rival—or even surpass—some of the biggest names in the market.

While Bitcoin targets an all-time high of $120,000, Dogecoin continues to rally, riding on its community-driven momentum. Amidst this excitement, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is emerging as the sleeper pick with explosive growth potential, poised to surge from $0.004 to $2 or more in the coming months. Dogecoin Riding the Meme Coin Wave to New Heights Dog coin (DOGE), the first funny money, has always counted on its faithful group and fun culture ties to push rise. New changes, like more big player care and Elon Musk’s steady support, have helped DOGE's new climb. With fresh attention, watchers think Dogecoin might reach new tops if it keeps its push. But, Dogecoin'͏s worth stays linked to market guessing, with few real-world uses. Although it does well as a token driven by community, its chance for growth is not as great as new projects like Lightchain AI which mix tech progress with strong group involvement. Bitcoin King of Crypto Targeting $120K Bitcoin, often hailed as the King of Crypto, has recently surpassed the $100,000 milestone, reflecting its dominant position in the cryptocurrency market. Analysts project further growth, with forecasts suggesting Bitcoin could reach $120,000 in the near future. This optimism is fueled by several factors, including the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have attracted significant institutional investment. Additionally, the election of President Donald Trump, who has expressed support for cryptocurrencies, has bolstered market confidence. However, it's important to note that Bitcoin's price is highly volatile and influenced by various factors, including regulatory developments and market sentiment. While the current trajectory appears promising, potential investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. Lightchain AI Rising Star Ready for a $2 Surge AAmid Dogecoin’s rally and Bitcoin’s climb, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is quietly emerging as a standout project in the crypto space. Having raised an impressive $9.4 million during its presale, it’s drawing attention for its innovative fusion of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Lightchain AI’s ability to execute decentralized AI computations gives it real-world utility in industries like logistics, healthcare, and predictive analytics, setting it apart from speculative tokens. The platform is also fostering ecosystem growth with strong developer support through grants and resources for building dApps, ensuring long-term adoption. With a presale price of $0.004 and a projected rise to $2, the potential 50,000% increase highlights its explosive growth possibilities, driven by a solid roadmap, major exchange listings, and strong investor interest. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Analysts predict that the ARB token could reach $1.83 by the end of 2024, driven by the growing adoption of Ethereum’s Layer-2 solutions. Despite some short-term volatility, ARB is well-positioned for long-term growth. Cardano (ADA) has faced a tough fourth quarter, with its price dropping to around $0.87. Analysts forecast ADA might stabilize between $1.5 and $2.0 in January, 2025 with the potential to rise to $2.5 by second quarter of 2025 if it can regain key resistance levels. Upcoming developments, such as the Vasil hard fork, could boost ADA’s performance. Injective (INJ) continues to show strong performance, benefiting from its focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) and innovative applications. The token has experienced consistent growth and remains a key player in the DeFi space, with potential for further gains as the market expands. >>> Kaspa (KAS) is gaining recognition for its high transaction throughput, thanks to its unique block processing approach. This positions KAS as a strong contender for future growth, particularly during the next market bull run, as it offers fast and efficient transactions. Conclusion: BIG BOSS INU , Arbitrum, Cardano, Injective, and Kaspa each offer unique opportunities for exponential growth by 2025.

Pepe Rescues Trump (PEPERTRU), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPERTRU is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Rescues Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Rescues Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Rescues Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Rescues Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Rescues Trump by entering its contract address – HtgdKmNDff2UgXmmJYCryKhjVE2F89XMncNt8oThipHz – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPERTRU.

Table of Contents Rexas Finance: A rising star Why traders are moving away from Solana RXS’s value proposition The trader’s bold prediction Momentum building ahead of the next bull market How to buy RXS Looking ahead Conclusion Stories of exponential expansion define the crypto market, and each cycle introduces fresh competitors demanding attention. While Solana (SOL) has been popular among traders due to its fast speed and scalability, that trend is slowly shifting as investors look toward newer altcoins. A trader has identified Rexas Finance (RXS) as the next big thing, predicting tremendous growth that a $640 capital investment would grow to $64,000 in 64 days. You might also like: Solana nears breakdown with short build-up; Rexas Finance hits presale ATH Rexas Finance: A rising star Offering a strong platform that combines real-world asset tokenizing, a token builder for new businesses, and a launchpad to help developers, Rexas Finance is making waves in the blockchain ecosystem. Its emphasis on practicality and creativity distinguishes it in a market frequently overflowing with speculative assets. At just $0.175 in its 11th presale stage, RXS has raised $35.3 million and sold over $392.5 million in tokens, drawing interest from traders looking for notable profits. Although Solana already has a high market valuation and limited space for explosive expansion, Rexas Finance presents the ground-floor possibility that crypto aficionados dream about. Why traders are moving away from Solana In recent years, Solana has had various difficulties, including centralizing issues and network failures. Although it is still a strong participant in the blockchain scene, its explosive increase has lowered hopes for future profits. Many traders think Solana’s days of producing explosive returns reflect past events. Now, introduce Rexas Finance, a startup meant to fill the present blockchain scene. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, RXS offers a fresh emphasis on valuable applications and the security and scalability of Ethereum’s infrastructure. This combo ranks it among the best contenders for traders looking for the next significant altcoin. RXS’s value proposition Rexas Finance stands apart with elements meant for both developers and regular consumers. Its token builder and launchpad streamline token creation and distribution, enabling new initiatives to flourish. This ecosystem offers a strong basis for long-term development and promotes invention. The initiative’s dedication to openness makes it even more attractive.

Among the various tokens that have emerged, meme coins have captured the hearts and wallets of many. Initially seen as a joke, these coins have taken on a life of their own, often driving significant investment and community engagement. It’s fascinating to see how something that started as a meme can become a serious financial asset. But the real question is: how do you pick the best new meme coins to join for long term success? Over the years, meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have skyrocketed in popularity, creating waves of interest and investment opportunities. Now, we’re witnessing a new wave of meme coins that promise to take the charm and community spirit of these coins to the next level. Among the most promising players in this space are BTFD Coin, Mog Coin, and Apu Apustaja. Each brings unique features and community-driven initiatives that could make them standout choices for anyone looking to invest in the best new meme coins to join for long term growth. BTFD Coin, in particular, has shown an impressive presale performance, breaking the $4 million mark in just the first month. With exciting features like a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game and staking rewards, it’s not just about the memes anymore; it’s about tangible benefits and community engagement. Analysts are buzzing with predictions, and with the current presale stage hitting over $5.1 million, it’s clear that BTFD Coin is setting the bar high. Let’s dive deeper into what makes these coins the best new meme coins to join for long term investment. BTFD Coin’s Presale Golden Streak BTFD Coin, also known as $BTFD, has taken the meme coin world by storm, especially with its presale performance. As of January 9, 2025, it’s in its 13th stage, with a current price of $0.000142. This coin has already raised over $5.1 million and boasts over 8,100 holders. What’s more, they’ve sold more than 64 billion coins, which is no small feat. This is the kind of momentum you want to see when looking for the best new meme coins to join for long term success. But what sets BTFD apart? For starters, this isn’t just another meme coin; it’s backed by a robust community and innovative features. The team behind BTFD Coin is focusing on building a Play-to-Earn game that promises not just fun but real financial rewards for players. Imagine playing a game and earning tokens that you can then use or trade. That’s the allure here, and it’s something that could elevate BTFD Coin to the top of the meme coin hierarchy. Moreover, the referral program adds another layer of excitement. It incentivizes community members to spread the word, creating a viral loop of growth. Anyone who gets in early on this coin might find themselves in a position to reap serious rewards. Analysts are predicting that once the presale ends and the coin hits exchanges, the price could soar to new heights. If you invested $80,000 at the current price, you would acquire around 563 million $BTFD coins. When the price potentially reaches $0.0006 by the end of the presale, that investment could be worth a whopping $337,800. That’s the kind of upside that makes BTFD Coin one of the best new meme coins to join for long term. Mog Coin Raising Expectations Next on our list is Mog Coin, another rising star in the meme coin universe. While it might not have the same presale figures as BTFD, Mog Coin is carving out its niche and raising expectations among investors. Its unique selling proposition lies in its community governance model, which allows holders to influence key decisions about the project’s direction. This level of engagement is crucial when you’re searching for the best new meme coins to join for long term investment. Mog Coin has been gaining traction through its active community and creative marketing strategies. The team behind Mog is committed to transparency and open communication, which builds trust—a vital factor when considering any investment. With a focus on creating a strong brand identity, Mog Coin is positioning itself to be a contender in the meme coin race. One of the exciting features of Mog Coin is its staking rewards. Investors who hold their coins can earn additional tokens simply by being part of the community. This not only incentivizes long-term holding but also aligns with the trend of making passive income from cryptocurrency investments. Imagine waking up to find that your investment has grown while you slept. That’s the dream, right? And let’s not forget about the potential for meme culture to drive prices up. If Mog Coin can tap into the right trends and humor, it might just explode in popularity. With its community-driven approach and potential for adoption, Mog Coin is definitely one of the best new meme coins to join for long term. Apu Apustaja Out to Prove Itself Last but not least, we have Apu Apustaja, a meme coin that’s out to prove it’s more than just a passing fad. With a name derived from internet culture, this coin has harnessed the power of memes to build a community that’s both engaged and passionate. The driving force behind Apu Apustaja is its commitment to charity and social impact, which resonates well with younger investors looking for something more meaningful. Apu Apustaja is working on several community initiatives aimed at giving back, which can elevate its brand image and attract more investors. It’s not just about making a quick buck; it’s about creating a legacy. This approach can significantly enhance its appeal, making it one of the best new meme coins to join for long term success. The coin has also announced plans for a P2E game, similar to BTFD Coin, which adds another layer of excitement. Combining gaming with charity creates an attractive proposition.

Price Poised for 80% Rally,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/xrp-breakout-alert-price-poised-for-80-rally/,"The post XRP Breakout Alert! Price Poised for 80% Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP, the native token of Ripple Labs, is poised for significant upside momentum following the breakout of a bullish price action pattern on the daily timeframe. Over the past few days, the overall cryptocurrency market has been struggling, and during this period, XRP experienced a prolonged consolidation. XRP Price Prediction According to expert technical analysis, XRP has broken out of a bullish flag and pole price action pattern on the daily timeframe and has closed a daily candle above the pattern. This pattern breakout has ended XRP’s prolonged consolidation. Based on recent price action, there is a strong possibility that it could soar by 80% to reach the $4.5 level in the coming days. Source: Trading View This bullish pattern appears to be a textbook example, indicating an ideal buying opportunity for traders and investors looking for long-term holdings. On-Chain Metrics Signal Investor Confidence Besides the recent breakout, XRP investors have already shown strong interest and confidence in the token, even during periods of price struggles. Since December 18, 2024, exchanges have recorded token inflows on only three days, despite a notable price decline across the market, as revealed by Coinglass’s spot inflow/outflow metrics. Source: Coinglass $13 Million Worth of XRP Outflow from Exchanges However, in the past 24 hours, on-chain metrics indicate that investors have withdrawn a significant 13 million XRP tokens from exchanges, highlighting the continuous accumulation by long-term holders. This ongoing accumulation could strongly support XRP in its rally. Besides long-term holders, trader participation has also skyrocketed. Since the breakout, XRP’s open interest has jumped by 31%, indicating strong engagement from traders amid the market shift. Current Price Momentum Currently, XRP is trading near $2.54 and has experienced a price surge of over 8.75% in the past 24 hours.

This resistance level has proven a formidable barrier, with bearish pressure consistently preventing any meaningful breakout. Despite initial signs of a potential rebound, DOGE’s inability to surpass this key threshold suggests that bullish momentum remains fragile, leaving the meme coin in a precarious position. The rejection at the 4-hour SMA highlights the growing dominance of sellers in the market, casting doubt on whether buyers can regain control to push the price higher. A decisive move above the 4-hour SMA could signal a resurgence of positive sentiment, possibly paving the way for DOGE to target higher resistance levels. On the other hand, a continued failure to overcome this obstacle might lead to increased selling pressure, pushing the price toward lower support zones. Analyzing DOGE’s Recent Price Movement Analyzing Dogecoin’s recent price movement reveals a significant challenge for the bulls. Despite an initial rebound, DOGE has struggled to break through the resistance at the 4-hour SMA, which has become a critical barrier. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Dips: A Warning Sign or A Hidden Opportunity? This indicates that upward momentum has faltered, and the market sentiment may be shifting. The failure to surpass this key level could suggest that further gains are unlikely without a consolidation phase or additional bullish catalysts. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator provides additional confirmation of the current bearish trend as the RSI line continues to stay below the 50% threshold. The RSI is widely used to assess the market’s strength, and when it remains below 50%, it often signals that selling pressure is prevailing over buying activity. This aligns with the recent price action of DOGE as the asset struggles to break through the key resistance level at the 4-hour SMA. DOGE’s RSI’s failure to rise above the 50% mark implies that bearish forces persist, limiting the meme coin’s chances of sustaining a rally. As long as the RSI remains below 50%, downward pressure may continue, making it hard for Dogecoin to break resistance and potentially push the price toward lower support levels. A bullish reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50%, signaling a shift in market sentiment. For now, the bearish tone indicated by the RSI highlights the challenges DOGE faces in maintaining an upward trajectory. Critical Support And Resistance Levels To Watch For DOGE, key support and resistance levels offer vital insights into its future price movements. Dogecon’s price is currently testing the $0.3066 support level, which could act as a foundation if the bearish momentum persists. If DOGE falls below this support, it may head toward $0.2677, reflecting more downside risks. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Confirms Breakout: Analyst Sets New Price Targets On the upside, should Dogecoin make a positive turn and break above the 4-hour SMA, the immediate resistance to watch is $0.3563. Furthermore, a successful breach of this level might pave the way for further upward movement, with the next target being the $0.4 resistance zone.

38820428,https://crypto.news/?p=14326423,1736653324,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/38820428.jpeg,Heritage Distilling and 5 other companies embracing Bitcoin,https://crypto.news/heritage-distilling-plus-5-other-food-beverage-bitcoin/,"Heritage Distilling is just the latest company to integrate Bitcoin into their operations, either by accepting it as a payment method or by holding it as part of their corporate treasuries. The Gig Harbor, Washington-based craft spirits producer will implement Bitcoin ( BTC ) payments through its direct-to-consumer e-commerce platform. The move follows the creation of the company’s Technology and Cryptocurrency Committee, led by digital payments expert Matt Swann. Heritage’s policy highlighted Bitcoin’s growing adoption among consumers, financial institutions, and policymakers. The company points to the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s 2023 policy change, which allows public companies to mark Bitcoin to fair value as an asset, making it more practical for corporate treasury management. The company also shares a different approach to managing Bitcoin price volatility, insisting that it offers protection that traditional Bitcoin investors lack when purchasing with fiat currency. As a consumer product manufacturer, Heritage notes that its production margins provide a buffer against Bitcoin price fluctuations. “As a company producing goods for sale, acceptable margins between the retail price of our products and their cost of production are expected to offset potential fluctuations in the value of bitcoin we accept as payment,” CEO Justin Stiefel said Jan. 10 in a prepared statement. You might also like: Nasdaq-listed Heritage Distilling introduces Bitcoin treasury plans Swann, who chairs the company’s Technology and Cryptocurrency Committee, will develop a formal Bitcoin Treasury Policy for board approval. “The growth of bitcoin is still in its early stages, and the opportunity for companies to accept bitcoin as payment is substantial,” he added. The policy builds on recent developments in corporate Bitcoin adoption (i.e. MicroStrategy ), as companies are adopting cryptocurrency for Treasury management and/or payment options. Here are several other notable examples in the food/beverage space: Table of Contents Steakholder Foods Beck & Bulow Chipotle Whole Foods Starbucks Honorable Mentions You might also like: 10 companies launch Bitcoin treasuries, but not Microsoft: Here are the risks, benefits Steakholder Foods Steakholder Foods Ltd., a company specializing in alternative protein production, announced in November that its board has approved the purchase of up to $1 million in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency tracking indices. CEO Arik Kaufman explained the decision, citing the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies. “As demand for cryptocurrencies grows and their acceptance as an asset class increases, we believe Bitcoin, or a mix of cryptocurrencies, will be strong treasury reserve assets for the company,” he said. Kaufman also pointed to recent developments like cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and institutional investor interest as reasons for the move. “Cryptocurrencies could add value to our treasury strategy and act as a store of value,” he said. Based in Rehovot, Israel, Steakholder Foods focuses on sustainable food technology. The decision to invest in cryptocurrency reflects the company’s interest in new financial strategies beyond its core business. Beck & Bulow Beck & Bulow, a Santa Fe-based meat and seafood company, announced last April that it would start accepting Bitcoin as a payment method, both online and in-store. The move, described by the company as an “innovative step,” aims to enhance payment flexibility and promote financial independence for customers and employees. Through an integration with IBEX, a third-party payment processor, customers can now purchase Beck & Bulow’s products using Bitcoin. But the company didn’t stop there. It also revealed plans to convert 20% of its assets into Bitcoin, citing the cryptocurrency’s potential as a reliable store of value. “We will also retain all Bitcoin payments received, reinforcing our confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential,” the company said in a statement. Beck & Bulow’s commitment to Bitcoin extends beyond payments and treasury. The company pledged to incorporate Bitcoin into its employee 401(k) program, offering staff a way to invest in the digital asset as part of their retirement planning. This bold move places Beck & Bulow among a growing number of businesses adopting Bitcoin, not just as a payment method but also as a core component of their financial strategies. The company’s decision reflects confidence in the cryptocurrency’s role in fostering financial innovation and resilience. Chipotle Chipotle Mexican Grill is especially bullish on Bitcoin and digital currencies as part of its strategy to innovate and engage tech-savvy customers. The fast-casual restaurant chain accepts Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for in-store payments through Flexa, a digital payments platform. Customers can use Flexa-enabled apps like Gemini or SPEDN to make cryptocurrency payments seamlessly. Chipotle has also leveraged cryptocurrency in its marketing campaigns, creating unique promotions to attract attention and reward customers. In April 2021, the company celebrated National Burrito Day by giving away $100,000 in Bitcoin. Participants guessed a six-digit passcode on a microsite for a chance to win. In July 2022, Chipotle ran another crypto-themed campaign, awarding over $200,000 in digital currencies through an interactive game. Of this, $35,000 in Bitcoin was split among six lucky winners. Chipotle’s digital innovation extends beyond cryptocurrencies. The company launched “Burrito Bucks,” its in-game currency on the Roblox platform, allowing players to exchange their Burrito Bucks for free entrée codes redeemable at participating Chipotle locations. Whole Foods Whole Foods currently accepts Bitcoin payments through third-party applications, allowing customers to purchase groceries using cryptocurrency. While the supermarket franchise doesn’t hold its own crypto treasury, its parent company is reportedly considering it. Recall how Amazon.com Inc. acquired Whole Foods in 2017, in a deal valued at $13.7 billion. The acquisition was a landmark move at the time, marking Amazon’s entry into the brick-and-mortar grocery business. And last month, a group of Amazon shareholders — led by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) — has proposed that the Seattle-based company allocate at least 5% of its assets to Bitcoin. The measure is currently set for review ahead of Amazon’s 2025 annual meeting, according to Guru Focus. Amazon’s board has yet to respond to the proposal. This push follows a similar effort by the NCPPR to encourage Microsoft to adopt Bitcoin, which was ultimately rejected by its shareholders. Starbucks In 2018, there was some confusion regarding Starbucks’ stance on accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. The company later clarified that it didn’t accept any form of crypto as a payment option. But that has since changed. The Seattle-based coffee giant now accepts Bitcoin payments via Flexa’s SPEDN app. This enables customers to pay for their drink and food orders using cryptocurrency. So far, there is no indication that Starbucks plans to build a Bitcoin treasury. The company’s focus appears to be on providing customers with diverse payment options rather than using cryptocurrency as a reserve asset, aligning with its strategy of convenience and innovation. While the adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury asset is still emerging in the food and beverage industry, these examples highlight a growing trend of integrating cryptocurrency into various aspects of business operations. Honorable Mentions Pizza Hut : In Venezuela, the casual dining franchise began accepting Bitcoin for payments due to the country’s economic challenges, though there are no reports of Bitcoin being held as part of its treasury. Restaurant Brands International : The Burger King parent company has begun accepting Bitcoin for payments in specific markets, including Germany and Venezuela. It remains to be seen whether the so-called “home of the Whopper” discloses crypto treasury holdings. Sheetz : The convenience store chain has begun accepting digital currencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, at all its locations. This move caters to the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies among consumers.

However, a new token called Rollblock makes the top 5 list of coins to consider in 2025 after a presale raise of over $8.5 million. Let’s check out our top 5 coins for 2025 and why they could be worthwhile investments. 1. Rollblock (RBLK) Rollblock is the newest kid on the block, but it has already established itself as one of the top cryptos to buy. The Rollblock project features a blockchain-based casino that eliminates conventional issues like rigged games and unfair house edge. It also features DeFi features like staking, with up to 30% APY for investors. There’s also a revenue-sharing program that rewards players and investors with a chunk of the casino’s weekly profits. So, both the operator and users get to benefit from the casino’s operations. The Rollblock RBLK token presale is currently in stage 9, trading for $0.045. 2. Solana (SOL) Solana is fast becoming the top choice for developers, especially those building dApps. As a result, the SOL token is predicted to reach new highs in the coming months. This will be fueled by DeFi projects gaining more traction. Consequently, SOL went up to $222 in early January, but the SOL price is now down to around $185. 3. Cardano (ADA) The ADA blockchain is famous for its altcoin. However, its use cases include supporting dApps to solve different blockchain-related problems. The ADA network’s DeFi features, including staking, are also attractive to investors. These features are powered by the ADA token. The ADA price is currently around $0.92, down by over 13% in the past week. However, analysts remain optimistic about a massive breakout in the near future. 4. XRP XRP is notable for its global payment network, which businesses leverage and developers use to exchange cryptocurrencies. The XRP token powers the ecosystem, and it has started 2025 on a high. In the past week, XRP has surged to $2.35 from its $2.25 price at the start of the year. The increase in the XRP price is a result of its increased demand following various strategic partnerships and network upgrades. However, there’s still a massive demand required for the XRP price to reach its all-time high value of $3.40 this year. 5. Shiba Inu (SHIB) SHIB is another crypto that started the year strong and can be a decent addition to any portfolio based on its recent performance. The meme coin has surged by over 100% in the past year, and its initial run to $0.000025 in early January indicates more potential gains. Though the Shiba Inu price is now down by over 9% in the past week, some investors are packing it up. That means they consider the current Shiba Inu price of $0.000022 to be a bargain ahead of its potential jump. Conclusion XRP, ADA, SHIB, RBLK, and SOL are the altcoins to consider in 2025. However, at its current low price, RBLK is better positioned for a massive jump. Interested investors can purchase the casino token for $0.045 before it increases to $0.052 in the next stage.

This movement is driven by increased liquidity and a rise in trading volumes. At the same time, the Injective (INJ) rally is picking up pace, with optimistic signs hinting at new peaks, despite the cautious stance from futures traders. Meanwhile, Web3Bay (3BAY) is incorporating web3 into e-commerce, completely rethinking online trade. With over $580,000 collected and 160 million tokens sold, Web3Bay’s decentralized method promises a safe, open, and cost-saving shopping experience. Poised to pioneer the next wave of online commerce, Web3Bay aims to take a substantial portion of Amazon’s market share. Filecoin Price Prediction: Reaching $30 After Multi-Year Formation? The Filecoin price prediction has become more compelling as FIL exits a longstanding symmetrical triangle, hinting at a shift to bullish trends. Recently, Filecoin has experienced a 30% increase, with experts setting a $30 target for the near future. A major element fueling this positive outlook for Filecoin includes the introduction of the FIL/KRW trading pair on South Korea’s Bithumb exchange, improving both liquidity and access. Additionally, a growing Total Value Locked (TVL) of $91.12 million and robust open interest are supporting Filecoin’s potential for sustained growth. Injective Rally Signals Hope for Reaching $30 The Injective (INJ) rally has captured the interest of traders, with the token rising 33% in value recently before stabilizing. Currently priced at $21.26, INJ displays bullish signals like an RSI of 58.88 and a positive MACD crossover, pointing to further gains. The community-backed shift to Injective 3.0, which reduces INJ’s supply, is propelling its upward trajectory. Although futures traders are still cautious, as shown by a Long/Short Ratio under 1, analysts believe the ongoing Injective rally might cause a short squeeze, potentially pushing prices above $28.72. If the momentum continues, INJ could break past $30 and may even reach $35.26, marking a significant achievement for the asset. Web3Bay Poised to Transform Traditional E-commerce! Web3Bay is set to revolutionize the e-commerce industry by blending blockchain technology with features that prioritize user security and cost-effectiveness. The platform’s presale has amassed over $580,000 with 160 million tokens sold. Aiming to change how users purchase, trade, and sell digital goods, Web3Bay is quickly becoming a decentralized e-commerce force, set to capture a large market share. But the big question remains: Should traditional platforms like Amazon be worried? While traditional e-commerce platforms have established the foundation for online shopping, Web3Bay introduces solutions that tackle key industry issues, like high fees and central middlemen, ensuring secure, transparent, and affordable transactions. Moreover, by integrating web3 into e-commerce, Web3Bay demonstrates its commitment to global access, enabling transactions without centralized control. Web3Bay’s vision extends beyond basic e-commerce offerings, planning an NFT marketplace and partnerships with DeFi platforms for staking, lending, and borrowing services. This expansive ecosystem underlines Web3Bay’s forward-looking approach, appealing to both traders and consumers. Currently, at just $0.0039675 per token in presale stage 3, the 3BAY token is projected to jump to $0.1959 at launch, presenting a potential 6,430% ROI. As Web3Bay’s presale figures near the million-dollar mark, its platform signifies a decisive move towards decentralized, secure, and efficient digital commerce. In essence, Web3Bay’s progress leaves no doubt: Amazon and other traditional e-commerce platforms have every reason to be concerned. Summing Up! The cryptocurrency landscape is evolving with promising opportunities across different sectors. The Filecoin price prediction highlights a bullish scenario, aiming for $30 following its breakout from a multi-year symmetrical triangle. Similarly, the Injective rally shows potential for significant gains, supported by community-led reductions in token supply and positive technical indicators. On the other hand, Web3Bay is setting itself up to challenge Amazon’s dominance in e-commerce, seeking a major market share . By integrating web3 into e-commerce, Web3Bay provides a new way of secure and cost-effective transactions. With over $580,000 raised, Web3Bay is not just transforming e-commerce but also offering a decentralized alternative to conventional giants.

The “Banana Zone,” coined by Pal, refers to periods of significant upward price movement. “Yes, we are still in the Banana Zone,” Pal said on X on Jan. 10, adding that the first phase of this bull market began with a breakout in November last year. This phase was followed by consolidation, similar to the 2016–2017 cycle, which Pal noted “won’t last long.” Pal predicted the next stage, the “Banana Singularity,” as an altcoin season “when everything goes up, followed by a bigger consolidation.” Altcoin seasons typically follow declines in Bitcoin (BTC) dominance, which currently remains high at 58%, per TradingView. DeFi researcher 0xNobler appeared to agree with Pal, writing on X that “Bitcoin just entered the acceleration phase” and forecasting a dramatic rise to $500,000, which could “ignite the biggest altseason in history.” Futures trader CoinMamba, however, offered a more skeptical take, saying, “This sell-off is so bad that we will have an altseason just by prices going back to what it was one week ago.” Pal described the third and final phase of the Banana Zone as the “concentration phase,” where “core winners explode on to make much higher highs.” Despite recent corrections, crypto markets have risen 90% year-over-year in total market capitalization, growing from $1.8 trillion to $3.4 trillion after most of 2024 was spent consolidating. Total market capitalization reached an all-time high of $3.9 trillion on Dec. 17, marking a 27% increase over the previous cycle’s peak.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 04:02:00

He highlighted the government’s stance on fostering technological progress, stating, “We want technology to evolve.” Mnuchin further addressed the regulatory approach, stressing that it was designed to ensure a “level playing field,” where financial services provided by traditional banks, fintech companies, or digital payment systems, are subject to the same standards. XRP’s Role in Leveling the Playing Field The video resurfaced in crypto discussions after Linda P. Jones, a prominent Wall Street veteran and crypto enthusiast, interpreted Mnuchin’s comments as aligning with Ripple’s XRP Ledger (XRPL). The XRPL’s native cryptocurrency, XRP, has long been touted as a solution for cross-border payments, offering cost-effective and efficient alternatives to legacy systems. Jones argued that XRP had been integral to the broader financial innovation plan, asserting, “Understand the XRP ledger is a public good, and all countries will be using it.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Mnuchin’s remarks provide a foundation for understanding the evolving regulatory landscape. Jones noted that Mnuchin acknowledged the benefits of distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), and underscored the need for oversight to prevent misuse. The focus on maintaining fairness across financial providers resonates with Ripple’s vision for the XRPL. Designed as an open, decentralized platform, the ledger enables real-time cross-border transactions while supporting interoperability between financial institutions. The Ledger also allows anyone to use it for various purposes. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Stuart Alderoty highlighted this decentralization in 2024 when there was speculation that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has been embroiled in a legal battle with Ripple for multiple years, was operating a node on the XRPL. A New Era for the Crypto Market Ripple has consistently positioned itself as a collaborator with regulators, advocating for transparent and equitable standards. Given the timing, Mnuchin’s acknowledgment of distributed ledger technology and his emphasis on a fair regulatory framework hold particular significance. In 2020, the crypto space faced increased scrutiny. This intensified in the following years with Gary Gensler and the Biden administration. However, things are changing, as Gensler resigns on January 20, the day of Trump’s inauguration. The XRP army is already celebrating Trump’s return to office. The freedom his administration will give the crypto space could help digital assets like XRP reach their full potential and help level the global financial playing field.

Elon Buys Solana (ELONBSOL), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Buys Solana launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 85b1Mza2zF6SDGXZURjeu53wdapN6W1UjFC4PAqhKE8k – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 04:25:00

While Bitcoin continues to lead the market, these altcoins are offering thrilling potential for exceptional gains. From the dependable Ethereum (ETH) to the rapidly emerging BIG BOSS INU, these digital assets are poised for significant growth. With a bull run anticipated, these top picks are positioned for strong performance in the coming months, attracting attention from savvy investors. Crypto Watch: BIG BOSS INU’s Presale Sparks Major Interest BIG BOSS INU is rapidly emerging as a key player in the crypto space, with its presale drawing strong investor interest. Seen as a high-reward opportunity, early backers are eager to jump in. The growing enthusiasm makes BIG BOSS INU a must-watch cryptocurrency this November. With its cutting-edge approach and bold development plans, BIG BOSS INU is poised for significant growth in the months ahead. >>>>>> Cardano (ADA) is gaining renewed investor attention following the Chang hard fork, which introduced on-chain governance to the network. ADA has been steadily growing, currently trading around $0.8, and is projected to reach $1 in the coming months due to its strong fundamentals in the DeFi space. Polygon (MATIC) continues to lead as a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, providing faster and more cost-effective transactions. With ongoing partnerships and its role in scaling Ethereum’s infrastructure, MATIC remains a strong contender for long-term growth, especially as DeFi and NFTs expand. Kaspa (KAS) has seen impressive growth, recently surging 36% following a major exchange listing. Known for its high transaction speeds through its GHOSTDAG technology, Kaspa is positioning itself as a key player in the blockchain space, especially for those seeking fast and efficient transactions. >>> TRON (TRX) is making significant gains in the DeFi and dApp sectors, with its price nearing its 2017 all-time high. TRX’s low transaction costs and high speeds make it an attractive option for developers, and analysts believe it could reach $2 by the first quarter of 2025, driven by increasing adoption. Conclusion As the crypto market prepares for another rally, investing in altcoins like BIG BOSS INU , Cardano, Polygon, Kaspa, and TRON offers a unique opportunity for significant growth. BIG BOSS INU’s presale has captured major investor interest, while Cardano’s advancements in DeFi, Polygon’s leadership in Ethereum scaling, Kaspa’s fast transactions, and TRON’s adoption in the DeFi space all indicate strong potential for explosive returns.

As the tokens gained new traction, their performance increased, increasing their demand even further. Let’s analyze the Fartcoin Vs Pippin price performance and where investors should invest in before January ends. Fartcoin Vs Pippin: Analyzing Their Price Performance Since its launch in October 2024, Fartcoin’s price has grown by 1580754.15%, showing an impressive performance on the chart. Although the meme coin had a slow start, it hit its prime at the beginning of January 2025, creating an ATH of $1.60 regardless of the market’s declining conditions. However, it currently traded at only $0.7913 after a 50% drop from the peak with $791M in market capitalization. There’s a significant drop in demand as the 24-hour trading volume has declined 40% to $98.81M. This is the result of the continuous downtrend, reducing the buyer’s activity as investors flock to utility-based tokens amid a consolidating market. On the other hand, Pippin is in its price right now, creating an ATH of $0.3269 just a few hours ago with increasing investor interest. According to Coingecko data , the Pippin price has surged 1453% in the last week and 3692% over the week, currently trading at $0.226. It also has $252M in market capitalization and $134M in trading volume, indicating a high demand for the token in the market. However, it could face consolidation next, with the RSI presenting overbuying zone. Where To Investment Before January Ends? Both meme coins have witnessed new highs in the last few days. One trader made $2.5M with Pippin , whereas many earned with the other. Interestingly, with a similar total supply and market background, Fartcoin is ahead in overall performance, but investors’ bullish sentiments are higher for Pippin per CoinmarketCap’s community sentiments. Considering the rising demand for AI cryptos and the market favoring AI in the cryptocurrency trend 2025 , Pippins gets ahead in the Fartcoin vs. Pippin battle for the short-term objective. However, Fartcoin is not much behind and presents a potential for trend reversal and recovery. A strategic trade with deep research and analysis could make significant returns for investors in both meme coins. What To Remember From This Fartcoin Vs Pippin Analysis? 2025 has favored two less-known cryptocurrencies, Fartcoin and Pippin, as their demand has grown in the last few days. The former achieved a peak at the beginning of the month and is in a downtrend today, but the other achieved a peak a few hours ago. However, consolidation could follow as the technical indicators indicate overbuying. Overall, both tokens show profit potential for January. This is not a Pippin price prediction or investment advice but an analysis of current performance. Investors should do their own research and technical analysis before investing in any cryptocurrency, as a market trend and community sentiments fluctuate often, leading to price fluctuations.

While the general market sentiment remains bullish, recent developments in the US economy indicate that macroeconomic factors may be against the premier cryptocurrency in 2025. Currently, Bitcoin trades above $94,000 following another turbulent price performance which produced a loss of 3.45% in the past seven days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Mixed Signals: Institutional Investors Accumulate Amid Retail Weakness Fed’s Pivot To Rate Cuts Is Dead – Analysts In an X post on December 10, market experts at global capital market analysis firm The Kobeissi Letter dissected the employment situation summary for December 2024. According to the BLS, nonfarm payrolls employment rose by 256,000 jobs in this month, indicating an additional 100,000 jobs to the widely predicted figures. Following this report, The Kobeissi Letter analysts highlight that the US economy has gained an average of 165,000 jobs since July representing the highest 6-month average since July 2024. Considering the US Federal Reserve began implementing interest rate cuts from September 2024 citing then a reduction in jobs growth and inflation, the analysts at The Kobeissi Letter stated the Apex Bank’s approach may have been misguided in light of the recent developments. Therefore, the Fed is expected to halt interest rate cuts to battle an expected heightened inflation due to a strong jobs data, with the potential of even adopting rate hikes. Generally, an absence of rate cuts or introduction of rate hikes is negative for Bitcoin as lower Interest rates afford investors the capacity to deal In risky assets such as cryptocurrencies. Following the Fed’s previous announcement of potential reduced rate cuts in 2025, Bitcoin experienced a flash crash of over 9% mid-December as investors moved to close their volatile positions in all financial markets. Currently, The Kobeissi Letter forecasts that the Fed’s pivot to rate cuts is likely over, with a 44% probability that there will be no rate cuts through June 2025.

Meanwhile, the premier cryptocurrency is down by 3.72% and 6.35% in the past seven and thirty days respectively. Despite the potential of reduced rate cuts in 2025, Bitcoin investors are likely to retain bullish sentiments due to other factors including historical price performance in a bull cycle, an expected pro-crypto US government and continuous institutional investments via the spot ETFs. With a market cap of $1.84 trillion, Bitcoin continues to rank as the largest cryptocurrency and world’s eight largest asset.

Judge Phyllis Hamilton’s order establishes clear boundaries for what information can be sealed from public view in the ongoing litigation. Legal Documents Get New Privacy Guidelines This latest ruling addresses specific exhibits tied to Ripple’s summary judgment motion. The court approved limited redactions of sensitive business data and personal information while maintaining broad public access to the core legal proceedings. The sealed documents include eight documents submitted by Ripple and 56 exhibits referenced by the plaintiffs. The court also accepted additional redactions sought by the plaintiffs to protect information linked to Ripple’s efforts to exclude certain expert testimony. The court based its decision on the “compelling reasons” standard outlined by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Under this standard, parties must demonstrate that the need for confidentiality outweighs the public’s interest in accessing court records. Judge Hamilton concluded that the proposed redactions were appropriately limited and satisfied legal requirements, ensuring sensitive business and personal information were protected. The decision follows an earlier directive requiring both parties to narrow their initial sealing requests . The SEC secured permission to protect portions of four exhibits containing confidential information. These include three documents supporting Ripple’s summary judgment motion and one related to expert witness testimony.

The regulatory body’s next filing could signal its strategic direction. This filing is even more notable because the SEC leadership is about to experience a major shake-up. Gary Gensler, the Chair of the regulatory agency, will resign on January 20. After years of holding back the crypto market, the news of Gensler’s departure was celebrated in the crypto industry. Many in the community believe Paul Atkins, the pro-crypto candidate picked by President-elect Donald Trump, will end the lawsuit against Ripple. However, the SEC has until January 15 to file its appeal brief or the lawsuit will be dismissed , so Gensler’s administration might still submit this brief. Despite this, the consensus is that the lawsuit will be dropped. Many in the community see Trump’s return to office as a game-changer for the crypto world, and it will be intriguing to see how the new SEC leadership handles the legal dispute with Ripple.

This time, the group has Meta Platforms Inc. in its crosshairs. Ethan Peck, a National Center employee, submitted a Bitcoin Treasury Shareholder Proposal to Meta on behalf of his family, marking yet another attempt to bring the cryptocurrency to the boardrooms of tech giants. Tim Jotzman, a Bitcoin ( BTC ) podcast host, shared the proposal on Jan. 10 via a social media post. See below. A #Bitcoin Treasury Shareholder Proposal has been submitted to Meta. The shareholder, Ethan Peck, who is an employee at The National Center for Public Policy Research – the organization that submitted to $MSFT & $AMZN – informed me he submitted on behalf of his family’s shares. pic.twitter.com/KrAKw7nHwp — Tim Kotzman (@TimKotzman) January 10, 2025 Will corporate treasuries turn into crypto strongholds? Based in Washington, D.C., the NCPPR has been touting Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic turbulence. They’ve already approached Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. with similar pitches. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft nixed the idea, but Seattle-based Amazon will reportedly consider it at an April meeting of its shareholders. NCPPR seems to be taking a page out of Michael Saylor’s playbook. Saylor, as former CEO and current chair of MicroStrategy, crafted a Bitcoin-heavy corporate strategy and has emerged as a poster child for corporate treasuries filled with crypto. If NCPPR gets its way, Meta and Amazon, like MicroStrategy, will allocate a portion of their respective assets to Bitcoin. Why? They see it as an alternative to lackluster corporate bonds due to its fixed supply. Also, Bitcoin ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, spiked 100% by the end of 2024. That’s quadruple the returns of the S&P 500 index and 35% higher than the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which tracks the magnificent seven tech giants (of which Meta, Microsoft and Amazon are members). And then there’s MicroStrategy, which saw its stock balloon 2,191% over five years. You might also like: Heritage Distilling and 5 other companies embracing Bitcoin Remember Libra? No? Good. Meta attempted to launch its own digital currency, Libra, in 2019 when the company was known as Facebook. The project aimed to create a global stablecoin backed by a basket of fiat currencies and government securities. Libra was intended to facilitate low-cost, seamless transactions worldwide, particularly for the unbanked population. However, the initiative faced significant regulatory pushback from lawmakers and financial authorities globally, who raised concerns about monetary sovereignty, data privacy, and potential misuse for illicit activities. The project rebranded as Diem in 2020, focusing solely on U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins. Meta courted Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal to be partners, but they withdrew support. By early 2022, Meta sold Diem to Silvergate Bank for around $200 million. While the Libra/Diem initiative was a bust, it demonstrated Meta’s ambition in the digital currency space. Whether Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his board take the NCPPR’s bait and make Bitcoin their next big move, remains to be seen.

While Bitcoin remains a dominant force, these altcoins are offering massive growth potential. From the well-established Ethereum (ETH) to the rising star BigBossInu, these digital assets are on track for extraordinary gains. Investors are closely watching these top picks as they are primed to surge ahead of the market rally, making them some of the most promising opportunities in the space. BigBossInu: Revolutionizing Crypto with Its Explosive Presale BIG BOSS INU is rapidly shaking up the crypto market, with its presale igniting strong demand from investors. This opportunity promises massive rewards for early backers. As anticipation builds, BigBossInu is one of the hottest cryptos to track this November. Armed with cutting-edge features and an ambitious roadmap, BIG BOSS INU is set to deliver game-changing growth in the months to come. >>>>>> XRP is currently trading around $2.2, buoyed by recent optimism surrounding potential ETF news and its ongoing legal battles with the SEC. Analysts suggest that if the legal outlook remains favorable, XRP could push toward $5 in the coming weeks. However, any negative developments could see the price drop back to support at $2.0. Dogecoin (DOGE) is hovering near $0.38 after a recent attempt to break above the $0.5 resistance level. Sellers have dominated the last few sessions, preventing DOGE from holding gains above this level. Buyers will need to defend current support levels to prevent a drop back toward $0.20. Sei (SEI) has experienced substantial growth over the last 30 days, rising by 43% and currently trading at $0.45. However, analysts warn of a potential pullback due to overbought conditions, with the price possibly dropping to $0.30 before a rebound that could drive SEI higher​. >>> Polkadot (DOT) is struggling to hold above the $8.50 resistance level, with recent declines pushing it down to around $6.5. Buyers have lost momentum, and if DOT fails to stay above critical support levels, it could face further declines. Final Thought As Bitcoin nears the $150K mark, cryptos like BIG BOSS INU, XRP, Dogecoin, and Polkadot show strong potential for growth. BIG BOSS INU’s presale, XRP’s legal optimism, Dogecoin’s resistance battle, and Polkadot’s support levels highlight their promise for significant returns.

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS.

Impact on Trend A move below the STH cost-basis could shift the bullish trend into a neutral or bearish phase , marking a turning point in market dynamics. Factors That Could Drive a Reversal 1. Profit-Taking by Investors Recent gains have led to increased profit-taking , which may push prices lower. 2. Broader Market Volatility External factors such as macroeconomic uncertainties or regulatory developments could contribute to downward pressure. 3. Declining Momentum Weakening trading volumes and reduced buying pressure may exacerbate a potential decline. Historical Precedents of STH Cost-Basis Breaches Date STH Cost-Basis Breach Market Reaction January 2022 Fell below key level Bearish trend ensued March 2023 Stabilized above key level Bullish rally followed August 2024 Briefly breached Sideways consolidation Historical data highlights the importance of this metric in signaling potential market shifts.

This article explores Woo’s insights, the underlying market dynamics, and what it means for Bitcoin investors. The Current Market Sentiment 1. Bullish Sentiment Prevails Bitcoin’s price momentum has fueled optimism, attracting both retail and institutional interest. Many investors view this as the beginning of a prolonged upward trend. 2. Signs of Profit-Taking Woo noted that profit-taking is becoming increasingly common, with more investors selling their holdings as prices climb.

Potential Correction A market correction could serve as a reset, providing an opportunity for new buyers to enter at lower price points. 3. Impact on Sentiment Overextended bullish sentiment could shift to caution or fear if corrections are significant. Strategies for Bitcoin Investors 1. Avoid Overleveraging Investors should refrain from using excessive leverage, as heightened volatility increases liquidation risks. 2.

Monitor Key Indicators Keep an eye on on-chain metrics, such as realized profits and market sentiment, to anticipate potential market shifts. 4.

Support and Resistance Levels Key support levels, such as $90,000 , and resistance levels, such as $100,000 , will play a pivotal role in shaping price movements. 3. Institutional Activity Institutional behavior often influences market sentiment; increased selling from large players could amplify corrections. FAQs 1. Why is Willy Woo urging caution for Bitcoin investors? Woo highlighted that market risk is peaking, with increased profit-taking indicating a potential short-term correction. 2. What does peaking risk mean for Bitcoin’s price? Peaking risk suggests heightened volatility and the possibility of a market reset before resuming upward momentum. 3. Should I sell my Bitcoin holdings now? Investors should assess their financial goals and market conditions; long-term holders may choose to ride out short-term volatility. 4. What are the key support levels for Bitcoin? Current support levels include $90,000 , with resistance at $100,000 . 5. How can investors manage risk in a volatile market?

Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz recently shared an example of a phishing email designed to impersonate Coinbase. The fraudulent email attempts to deceive recipients into updating their account details via a malicious link, potentially compromising their sensitive information. Scam Warning: If you see an email that looks like this, it's a scam. pic.twitter.com/klneRy7dor — David ""JoelKatz"" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 11, 2025 Increasing Scam Attempts in 2025 Scam campaigns have plagued the cryptocurrency space for years, with scammers exploiting unsuspecting users by imitating trusted platforms. This warning from Schwartz follows other scam attempts reported in late 2024, indicating that malicious actors ramp up their efforts as the new year begins. The broader crypto community has shown appreciation for figures like Schwartz, who regularly alert users to such dangers. One community member, BankXRP (@BankXRP), stated , “It’s really great that you do this David along with some of the other large X accounts to help protect the community.” Ripple has historically taken a strong stance against scams. In early 2024, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse publicly criticized platforms such as X and YouTube for allowing scam-related content to proliferate, as both platforms hosted XRP scams as ads. While these platforms have made efforts to address the issue, scammers continue to find ways to bypass detection mechanisms. XRP Community Response to Schwartz’s Warning Community members have also shared advice on how to avoid falling victim to scams. One user emphasized the importance of exercising caution with email links, saying , “I make it a practice to never use links sent in emails unless I’ve just requested it.” He noted that this practice helps avoid scam emails, as scammers are becoming increasingly sophisticated and it is harder to tell them apart from real emails. Others echoed similar sentiments, urging users to verify communication authenticity directly through official channels. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 How To Stay Safe The phishing email shared by Schwartz reflects a common tactic in these scams. It mimics the branding and tone of legitimate companies, creating a false sense of urgency to manipulate recipients into acting hastily. The email claims that users need to update their account details, directing them to click on a link that likely leads to a malicious website. Experts recommend several precautions to safeguard against phishing and other fraudulent schemes. First, users should never click on unsolicited links or attachments in emails, even if the sender appears legitimate. Instead, they should navigate to the official website by manually entering the URL into their browser. Second, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on accounts adds additional security. The scam attempts have become more frequent since the start of the new year, and as scams become increasingly sophisticated, community awareness remains a crucial defense.

In a recent blog post, Butterfill suggested that establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States could yield a more profound impact on Bitcoin adoption than the highly anticipated Bitcoin ETFs launched last year. Butterfill argues that this legislation could alleviate lingering skepticism around institutional Bitcoin investments, setting a precedent for other governments and significantly boosting Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Understanding the U.S. Bitcoin Act 1. What Is the Bitcoin Act? The Bitcoin Act proposes the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States, positioning Bitcoin as a national asset similar to gold. 2. Goals of the Act Legitimizing Bitcoin : Enhance Bitcoin’s status as a credible institutional asset. Encouraging Adoption : Incentivize other governments to explore similar strategies. Strengthening U.S. Financial Leadership : Establish the U.S. as a global leader in cryptocurrency adoption and innovation. How the Bitcoin Act Could Impact Institutions 1. Overcoming Negative Perceptions Institutional investors often face scrutiny over cryptocurrency investments due to regulatory uncertainty and market volatility. By establishing a strategic reserve, the Bitcoin Act could lend credibility to Bitcoin as a reliable asset class, reducing hesitations among major investors. 2. Increasing Institutional Flow Butterfill predicts that the Act could trigger a substantial influx of institutional capital , surpassing the impact of Bitcoin ETFs. Institutions like pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and insurance companies could be more inclined to add Bitcoin to their portfolios. 3. Global Ripple Effect If the U.S. leads by example, other governments may follow suit, creating a domino effect that accelerates Bitcoin’s adoption worldwide. Comparison: Bitcoin ETFs vs. the Bitcoin Act Aspect Bitcoin ETFs Bitcoin Act Adoption Catalyst Simplifies access for retail investors Targets large-scale institutional adoption Impact Horizon Short to medium term Long term Credibility Boost Moderate High, due to government endorsement Scope Limited to financial products National and global financial ecosystems Why the Bitcoin Act Matters More Than ETFs 1. Greater Institutional Confidence Government backing reduces perceived risks, encouraging institutions to invest larger sums. 2. Broader Adoption Beyond ETFs While ETFs primarily attract retail investors, the Bitcoin Act appeals to institutional and governmental players, amplifying Bitcoin’s reach. 3. Stability for Bitcoin Establishing a national reserve would reduce Bitcoin’s perceived volatility, making it more attractive to long-term investors. CoinShares’ Perspective on the Bitcoin Act According to Butterfill, the Bitcoin Act could fundamentally reshape the global perception of Bitcoin by: Aligning Bitcoin with traditional strategic assets like gold. Encouraging broader financial system integration. Highlighting the utility of Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat currency risks. What Would Adoption Look Like? 1. U.S. Reserve Implementation The U.S. government could allocate a portion of its treasury holdings to Bitcoin, signaling its importance as a strategic asset. 2. Institutional Buy-In Institutions would likely follow the government’s lead, viewing Bitcoin as a credible and necessary diversification tool. 3. International Adoption Countries like Switzerland and Singapore, already friendly toward crypto, could adopt similar measures, accelerating global Bitcoin adoption. Potential Challenges 1. Regulatory Pushback Critics may argue that allocating government resources to Bitcoin is risky due to its volatility. 2. Market Volatility While the Bitcoin Act could stabilize Bitcoin over time, initial market reactions might be unpredictable. 3. Political Resistance Gaining bipartisan support for such an initiative could be challenging, delaying its implementation. FAQs 1. What is the U.S. Bitcoin Act? The Bitcoin Act is a proposed legislation to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the U.S., positioning it as a national asset. 2. How does the Bitcoin Act compare to ETFs? While ETFs cater to retail investors, the Bitcoin Act targets institutional and governmental adoption, offering long-term benefits. 3. What is the significance of a strategic Bitcoin reserve? It legitimizes Bitcoin as a strategic asset, reducing skepticism and encouraging institutional investments. 4. Could other countries follow the U.S. Bitcoin Act? Yes, Butterfill believes the Act could inspire other nations to adopt similar measures, boosting global Bitcoin adoption. 5. What are the potential risks of the Bitcoin Act? Regulatory pushback, political resistance, and short-term market volatility are key challenges. Conclusion The proposed U.S. Bitcoin Act could have a transformative impact on Bitcoin adoption, surpassing the effects of last year’s Bitcoin ETFs. By legitimizing Bitcoin as a national strategic asset, the Act has the potential to attract significant institutional investments, reduce skepticism, and inspire global adoption. While challenges remain, the Bitcoin Act represents a bold step toward integrating Bitcoin into the broader financial ecosystem, ensuring its role as a critical asset in the 21st century.

38743181,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/best-crypto-to-buy-now-meme-index-hits-2m-in-presale,1736661607,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/38743181.jpeg,Best Crypto To Buy Now? Meme Index Hits $2M In Presale,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/best-crypto-to-buy-now-meme-index-hits-2m-in-presale,"A new meme coin, Meme Index (MEMEX) , is receiving considerable praise early in its presale, with some calling it one of the best crypto to buy now. There is a strong demand for MEMEX among smart money investors and retailers alike, with the new meme coin having already raised over $2 million in its presale. Meme Index - Invest In Meme Coin Baskets The strong demand for meme coins means that the sector has ballooned to thousands of tokens, a number of which have high upside potential. While whales can easily invest in a broad selection of meme cryptos for outsized returns, small-scale retailers often have just enough funds for two to three investments. Their all-in approach also has considerable risk and opportunity cost — many tokens underperform while others may turn out to be scams. Consider, Moo Deng, for example. The meme coin is live on almost all top-tier CEXs, including Coinbase and Binance Futures. It currently represents the third-largest allocation by the trading firm Wintermute. And yet, the Moo Deng coin is down by nearly 30% since its Coinbase listing. While the meme coin is expected to eventually skyrocket, small-scale investors who went all-in on MOODENG are currently in significant losses. Meme Index is looking to tackle this issue head-on. It is the first-ever decentralized index fund for meme coins, seeking to offer broad market exposure to investors while spreading the risk. Investors will have their choice from four separate indexes. The Meme Titan Index will include blue-chip meme coins, many of which have multi-billion dollar valuations. The basket will likely feature assets like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe. Similarly, the Meme Moonshot Index will include the high-flyers — tokens that have been showcasing outsized growth and are poised to hit the billion-dollar mark. This basket could have projects like Notcoin, First Neiro On Ethereum and Snek. Third is the Meme Midcap Index, featuring assets within the $50 million and $250 million valuations. Investors could find the next Binance meme coins in the basket, especially since the world’s leading exchange has been listing low-cap crypto assets in recent months. Finally, the Meme Frenzy Index will include high-risk, high-reward meme coins. This index is designed for the degens and could offer outsized returns, especially in the upcoming meme coin supercycle. Notably, only MEMEX holders will be able to invest in these baskets, which explains the strong early demand for the new crypto coin. Moreover, they will vote on which meme coins are included in each basket, a feature that has impressed the experts. It will allow investors to benefit from community-intelligence — making money from investments that they otherwise would have missed out on. Moreover, it would be extremely unlikely that a scam token would make it into the basket. With its unique value proposition, it is no surprise that smart money investors are calling Meme Index one of the best crypto to buy now. Is MEMEX The Best Crypto To Buy Now? Aside from its innovation and community governance, MEMEX is also a meme coin with strong fundamentals. Smart money investors are impressed with its community-centric tokenomics, multiple security audits and strong social media presence. For instance, the Meme Index X account — which was created at the start of the presale — already has nearly 20k followers. This is on top of the 2.3k Telegram subscribers. Retail investors are also investing in MEMEX due to its presale staking platform, which is currently offering a reward rate of over 1100%. Unsurprisingly, Meme Index is being backed as one of the best crypto to buy now. Many smart money investors are eyeing up to 10x returns from it following its launch.

As Ripple continues to solidify its position in cross-border payment solutions, XRP is seen as a valuable asset in the evolving financial ecosystem. 2.

Reduced Circulating Supply Large-scale purchases remove significant quantities of XRP from circulation, potentially driving up demand. 3.

38825799,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=120536,1736662328,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"India Needs Favorable Policies for Web3 to Avoid Losing ₹17,700 Crores in TDS Revenue",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/india-favorable-web3-policies/,"India stands at a pivotal juncture in the global Web3 revolution. Despite having one of the largest cryptocurrency user bases, restrictive taxation and policies are driving Indian crypto traders and investors toward offshore platforms. This trend not only hampers the growth of the domestic Web3 ecosystem but also poses a risk of losing ₹17,700 crores in Tax Deducted at Source ( TDS ) revenue over the next five years. Organizations like CoinDCX and the Blockchain and Web3 Association (BWA) are advocating for friendlier policies and reduced tax burdens to keep India competitive in the Web3 space. With the Indian government inviting citizens to contribute their ideas for the Union Budget 2025-2026 , now is the time to act. The State of Web3 Taxation in India 1. High Tax Rates Are Pushing Users Offshore Since the 1% TDS on cryptocurrency transactions was implemented in July 2022 , over ₹500,000 crores have been traded on offshore crypto platforms . A report by Esya Centre estimates that India lost ₹6,000 crores in tax revenue as a result of this migration. 2. Complex Tax Laws Discourage Local Engagement The current Sections 194S and 115BBH of the Income Tax Act impose high tax burdens on crypto transactions, with a flat 30% tax rate on gains. This lack of differentiation between speculative trading and legitimate investments stifles the Web3 ecosystem’s potential. Why Favorable Policies for Web3 Are Essential 1. Economic Growth and Job Creation Web3 is a rapidly expanding industry that offers opportunities in blockchain development , DeFi , NFTs , and metaverse applications . Pro-business policies could foster job creation and economic growth, turning India into a global Web3 hub. 2. Boosting Tax Revenues Lowering the tax rate and encouraging onshore trading could significantly increase compliance, boosting tax revenues. 3. Retaining Talent and Capital Restrictive policies risk driving away India’s talented developers and entrepreneurs to countries with more crypto-friendly environments, such as Singapore or Dubai. Three Key Requests for Strengthening Web3 in India 1. Reduce the Crypto Tax Rate to 0.01% A lower TDS rate would reduce the burden on traders, encourage onshore trading, and improve compliance. Countries like Japan have implemented lower tax rates to foster innovation in blockchain and cryptocurrency. 2. Amend Sections 194S and 115BBH of the Income Tax Act Introduce provisions ensuring that offshore platforms comply with local tax laws , irrespective of their physical location. This would create a level playing field for domestic exchanges and discourage capital flight. 3. Provide Regulatory Clarity Establish clear guidelines for the taxation and operation of Web3 companies. Recognize cryptocurrencies and blockchain as legitimate industries, distinct from speculative gambling. How Citizens Can Contribute to Policy Change The Indian government is inviting citizens to submit suggestions for the Union Budget 2025-2026 . Here’s how you can help shape Web3 policy: Visit the official portal to share your suggestions: Union Budget Suggestions Portal Advocate for the following: Reduction of the crypto tax rate to 0.01% . Amendments to Sections 194S and 115BBH to ensure fair competition. Policies that encourage Web3 innovation and blockchain adoption . What’s at Stake if India Doesn’t Act? 1. Loss of Revenue India risks losing ₹17,700 crores in TDS revenue over the next five years if the current trends persist. 2. Brain Drain Top developers and entrepreneurs may relocate to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. 3. Missed Global Leadership Opportunities With countries like the UAE, Singapore, and Switzerland making strides in Web3, India could lose its chance to lead this global transformation. FAQs 1. Why should India reduce the crypto tax rate? Lowering the tax rate to 0.01% would encourage onshore trading, boost compliance, and increase tax revenues while fostering innovation. 2. What are Sections 194S and 115BBH of the Income Tax Act? These sections govern the taxation of cryptocurrency transactions, imposing high tax rates that discourage domestic engagement. 3. How can individuals contribute to Web3 policy reform? Citizens can share their suggestions on the Union Budget Suggestions Portal , advocating for friendlier Web3 policies. 4. What are the benefits of fostering Web3 innovation in India? Web3 has the potential to drive economic growth, create jobs, and position India as a global leader in blockchain technology. 5.

However, in the past weeks, XRP has broken through key resistance levels, which could signal the start of a new bullish trend. At the time of writing, XRP is trading above the $2.50 mark and is up by more than nine percent in the last 24 hours. When looking at the chart, the price of XRP is now positioned above certain important levels, hinting that the market could potentially move upwards towards new highs. Important Price Levels To Monitor Looking ahead, for XRP to continue its upward movement and reach new highs, it will need to break through some key resistance points. The first level to watch for an upward breakout is around $2.55, followed by another resistance level at $2.72. If XRP can clear both of these levels, it could pave the way for a rally that may take the price toward all-time highs. However, it’s important to note that there is an invalidation point for this bullish scenario. If the price drops below $1.96, this could signal that the current trend may not continue, and the market outlook would need to be reassessed. Therefore, the support levels in the $2.20-$2.30 range are critical for the short-term outlook of XRP. Technical Analysis: XRP has formed a triangle pattern, which consists of five waves: A-B-C-D-E. This pattern has now technically completed its minimum requirements. The formation of this pattern suggests that the price could break out either upwards or downwards. As of now, there has already been a positive reaction to the support areas between $2.20 and $2.30, which are Fibonacci levels that traders use to identify potential support and resistance zones.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-12 06:18:00

Despite challenging conditions, XRP has managed to maintain its position above key demand levels, fueling optimism among investors and analysts alike. As the market looks for signs of recovery, many see the altcoin as a potential leader poised for significant gains in the coming months. Related Reading: Whales Buy 470 Million Dogecoin In 48 Hours As Price Tests Crucial Demand Level – Details The anticipation of a massive rally continues to build, with investors eagerly awaiting XRP’s breakout above its all-time high (ATH). Such a move would mark a pivotal moment, setting the stage for price discovery and substantial growth. Adding to the optimism, top analyst Cheds Trading recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting a critical development in XRP’s price action. According to Cheds, XRP has scored a lower high break on the daily timeframe—an indicator that often signals a bullish continuation. This technical milestone suggests that XRP’s upward momentum could intensify soon, further solidifying its bullish outlook. With market participants closely monitoring these developments, XRP appears well-positioned to capitalize on any broader market recovery and lead the charge toward new heights. XRP Eyes Rally Amid Market Uncertainty XRP is trading just below a crucial supply zone. Market watchers are optimistic about its potential to ignite a massive rally if it breaks through this level. This optimism is fueled by XRP’s strong performance since the U.S. election, which has bolstered investor confidence in its prospects for 2025. Analyst BigCheds recently shared a technical analysis on X that adds weight to the bullish sentiment surrounding XRP. According to BigCheds, XRP has achieved a lower high break on the daily timeframe, which is a key technical signal for a bullish trend. This development suggests that the momentum is building, and XRP may be preparing for a significant breakout. For XRP to sustain this bullish trajectory, the next critical step is to break above the $2.80 mark. This level serves as a major barrier and a gateway to challenging its all-time high (ATH). If XRP reclaims this territory, it will enter price discovery—a phase often leading to exponential growth as buyers drive the price higher with little historical resistance.

Investors are closely monitoring these developments, as breaking the $2.80 level could set the stage for XRP to lead the market into a new era of gains. Price Action Shows Bulls In Control XRP is trading at $2.54 after an impressive 15% surge since Friday, showcasing renewed bullish momentum in a market filled with cautious optimism. Bulls have taken control, pushing the price higher and testing crucial resistance levels that could define the next phase of XRP’s rally. The immediate challenge for XRP lies at the $2.72 supply zone, a key level that hasn’t been tested since mid-December. Breaking above this critical resistance would signal the potential for a rally into uncharted territory, setting XRP toward price discovery. A breakout here would likely lead to an aggressive upward move, attracting fresh capital and fueling bullish sentiment. However, the bullish case is not without risks. XRP must hold above the $2.45 mark to sustain its upward trajectory. Failure to maintain this support could lead to increased selling pressure, possibly sending the price back into a consolidation phase.

Jones has addressed recent interpretations of her comments on XRP’s future. During Episode 1453 of her podcast, Jones provided important context about her perspective on the digital asset’s price trajectory, particularly addressing reports that suggested she had predicted a $100 valuation. The discussion emerged following Jones’s December 31, 2024, social media post where she illustrated XRP’s price evolution through a comparative analysis. She detailed how her initial investment demonstrated the significant growth XRP has experienced. XRP’s Growth Over the Years When Jones first entered the market, traders could buy 400 XRP for just $100 with tokens costing approximately $0.25. In contrast, the same $100 investment now yields roughly 44 XRP tokens, reflecting the substantial appreciation in value. Jones emphasized that her analysis was not intended as a short-term price prediction, but rather as an illustration of the digital asset’s evolution. “I’m just not going to give a price target,” she stated during her podcast, directly addressing the media’s interpretation of her comments. In her post from December, Jones compared XRP’s price, and wrote, “Sometime in the future, it will buy 1 XRP.” While she did not directly predict that the digital asset would grow to $100 , it is easy to imply that from her statement. She encouraged her audience to examine complete contexts rather than relying on headline interpretations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 When is XRP Going to $100 Jones clarified that she did not say XRP would reach $100 this year. XRP is trading at $2.53, following a massive 7.15% increase in the past 24 hours. Jones has an optimistic outlook on the asset’s future, particularly in light of evolving regulatory frameworks and institutional adoption patterns. While avoiding specific predictions, she suggests that the cryptocurrency market is in its early stages, indicating potential for significant future development. This suggests there is much room for growth, and the digital asset could hit the $100 target somewhere down the line. Jones’s analysis incorporates historical cryptocurrency market developments, particularly drawing from Bitcoin’s price evolution. Bitcoin began at almost nothing and recently hit an all-time high of over $108,000, showing the potential of cryptocurrencies. Jones also delved into regulatory developments affecting the cryptocurrency sector. She referenced significant policy statements, including those from former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in July 2019 regarding leveling the playing field in financial markets, and her recent post suggests XRP and the XRP Ledger can fulfill that role. While media attention has focused on potential price targets, Jones’s message emphasizes the digital asset’s potential. Although she did not provide a timeline, she expects big things for the digital asset. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

While the market has once again found support in a key area, the level could be broken to the downside soon. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart On the daily chart, the asset was recently pushed above the $100K level but failed to maintain momentum and fell down. Yet, the $92K level has once again held the cryptocurrency, preventing a deeper decline. Yet, as the level has been tested multiple times already, it is very likely that the price will break to the downside in case of another test. On the other hand, if the level holds, the market will once again try to break above the $100K level and pave its way toward a new all-time high. The 4-Hour Chart Looking at the 4-hour chart, the recent price action becomes much more clear to interpret. With a failed bullish breakout above $100K a few days ago, the market has experienced a quick downturn. However, the $92K level has halted the decline. Yet, the momentum is still bearish, as the market is not showing any significant willingness to rise back toward the $100K area. Therefore, if things remain the same, a breakdown of the $92K level and a drop toward the $85K mark will be probable. On-Chain Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Exchange Reserve While Bitcoin’s price has been consolidating below the $100K level over the past couple of months, market participants are becoming worried about the overall direction. This is quite clear when analyzing the futures market sentiment. This chart presents the funding rates metric, one of the best measures for evaluating the futures market sentiment. Positive values indicate bullish sentiment, and negative numbers are associated with a bearish sentiment. As the chart suggests, while the funding rates remain positive, they have significantly declined compared to December and even March last year when the market first touched the $70K mark. While this shows uncertainty by market participants, it also indicates that the futures market is not overheated, and sufficient spot market demand can push the price higher and initiate a sustainable rally.

The price remains confined within a sideways wedge pattern, highlighting a phase of consolidation and indecision. A decisive breakout is necessary to establish a sustained market direction. XRP Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Ripple’s current low volatility signals a lack of trading interest, potentially linked to broader macroeconomic factors, such as uncertainty surrounding President Trump’s transition to the White House. XRP’s price remains trapped within a wedge pattern and oscillates in the $2-$3 range even though it jumped to $2.6 yesterday evening. A breakout from this range is crucial, as it will likely dictate Ripple’s long-term trend. A bullish breakout could trigger a rally, while a bearish breakout may result in significant declines. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Ripple found support at the 0.5 Fibonacci level ($2), prompting a minor upward move. However, the price has now entered a low volatility phase with no clear directional bias. Ripple faces significant support near the 0.5 ($2) and 0.618 Fibonacci levels, which have served as strong defenses for buyers in recent months. If buyers manage to defend this region, XRP may experience a bullish spike. However, if sellers push the price below this key support zone, the market could face long liquidations, leading to a substantial decline.

Cardano (ADA) is one example of how a blockchain can originate to become a viable Layer 1 ecosystem. But often, the spotlight is cast on new contenders able to deliver extraordinary returns in the market. Cardano Price Journey: ADA Down 6% Daily As with Cardano’s story, it’s one of continuity and the ability to bounce back. As a competitor to Ethereum, it quickly gained traction based on its focus on scalability, sustainability, and security. Soon after, the Cardano price reached its all-time high at $3.10 in September 2021 and was recognized as one of the top cryptocurrencies. It was such an astronomical rise that it offered life-changing gains to early ADA investors who experienced the 14,400% increase in Cardano price. Like most cryptocurrencies, ADA also could not escape the subsequent market downturn. Currently, ADA trades at around $0.93 —which is far from the ATH Cardano price. As its ecosystem grows with new projects and partnerships, Cardano is only scratching the surface of what’s possible. However, analysts have noted that ADA’s potential for meteoric growth is limited by the size of its market cap, which, at over $32 billion, is extremely large. If you’re looking for a huge upside, Cardano prices today look decidedly more stable than transformative. Enter IntelMarkets (INTL): The Next Big Thing Cardano has made it big, but IntelMarkets is the future. The cutting-edge features of this project bring together artificial intelligence and blockchain technology to create a revolutionary AI-powered trading platform. IntelMarkets is preparing to change the face of how trading is done by targeting inefficiencies in the $264 billion crypto trading market. The experts behind IntelMarkets are a team of leading researchers from OpenAI and MIT who developed the proprietary Intell-M trading bots. By generating trading insights, INTL creates the opportunity for its platform to monitor mountains of market data in real-time and make very sophisticated trading decisions on its users’ behalf. Unlike other trading systems, IntelMarkets is constantly learning from past performance, and as a result, it’s a step ahead of its competition. Its early-stage value proposition makes IntelMarkets even more compelling. The INTL token is in the ninth presale phase of its ICO and is priced at $0.082 at present. Its high reward and low entry point make it a promising investment. IntelMarkets may register a whopping 14,400% growth; it could go toe to toe with Cardano’s meteoric rise in the 2021 bull run, experts predict. The Next Cardano is Here ADA has a great legacy as one of the top altcoins, but the room for growth on Cardano prices is limited by its size and the fact that it’s become established in the market. With its AI-powered approach to crypto trading, IntelMarkets is revolutionizing blockchain innovation. Being a low-priced investment with enormous potential for life-changing returns makes it an unrivaled option for investors seeking to change their lives.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-is-days-away-from-breakout-towards-new-all-time-highs-heres-why/,"An analysis of XRP’s current market position suggests that a significant price move is imminent, and this move could send it to a new all-time high. Currently trading at $2.56, the digital asset has demonstrated notable resilience and strength, capturing the attention of analysts. One of the key factors driving optimism is XRP’s stability around critical Fibonacci retracement levels. Cryptocurrency analyst The Great Mattsby (@matthughes13) recently highlighted on X that the token’s positioning near the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level is a crucial technical signal. He showed that breaking above $2.36, which aligns with the 0.886 Fibonacci level, could pave the way for a substantial price rally, indicating strong bullish momentum. According to Mattsby, the digital asset is potentially days away from a new all-time high, and now that it has broken above $2.36, it is much closer to achieving this goal. This daily chart suggests that $XRP might just be weeks, if not days away from a breakout towards all time highs. Perhaps it just once to touch the cloud ONCE before launch pic.twitter.com/7gfwZwmTy2 — The Great Mattsby (@matthughes13) January 10, 2025 Additional XRP Bullish Signs Adding to this outlook, XRP trades well above the Ichimoku Cloud, a widely regarded indicator of market sentiment and momentum. The asset’s price exceeds the Conversion Line at $2.33 and the Base Line at $2.31, typically associated with upward trends in asset prices. Significant accumulation by whales further highlights XRP’s positive trajectory. Historically, such accumulation patterns have been precursors to significant price movements, suggesting institutional confidence in XRP’s long-term potential. From a market structure perspective, analyst Captain Faibik has noted XRP’s breakout from a descending channel, a development that traditionally signals a shift in market dynamics. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potential Targets for XRP This breakout and the token’s ability to maintain a price above $2, have led to ambitious projections. Faibik suggested XRP could target $3.66, a level supported by his technical indicators and sustained trading activity. Market factors are also bolstered by increasing adoption. David Stryzewski, CEO of Sound Planning Group, recently revealed that Bank of America has incorporated XRP into its internal transaction processes, further validating its utility. This development aligns with broader expectations for increased adoption, particularly if cryptocurrency-friendly regulations emerge. With XRP on the rise again, investors will eagerly observe its price to see what direction it takes. The market has significant positive momentum, and this could help the asset reach the $3.66 level or a new all-time high soon.

Several technical signals, such as the Golden Cross and bounce from the $91,000-$92,000 zone, are pointing to the fact that the crypto bull run is far from over. With BTC ripe for a major comeback , this could be the perfect opportunity to invest in altcoins – and there’s hardly a better time to purchase these tokens than in their presales. In this article, we bring to you the top 4 altcoin presales dominating the market right now. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Overall Best Crypto Presale in 2025 Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) gives retail investors trading signals and insights into the crypto market that are usually only accessible to Wall Street investors. Its goal is to create an active community that can take power away from the hands of crypto whales, empowering the common man. The token went into presale towards the end of 2024. So far, it has managed to raise more than $45M . Currently, each token is priced at $0.00036646, but the next phase of the presale is only a few hours away, so right now is the cheapest available price. As per some experts, $WEPE could be the best-performing token in 2025. The biggest reason for this is that while some meme coins are just a trend (meaning their popularity might crash at any time), $WEPE actually solves the problem of crypto whales manipulating the market and creates an even playing ground for everyone. Some even say that $WEPE might outperform $PEPU, whose price jumped by 500% after launch. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Layer-2 Solution on the Solana Network Solaxy ($SOLX) is native to the Solana blockchain and is, in fact, the first-ever Solana Layer-2 upgrade. It aims to mitigate the problems of Solana’s current network, such as traffic congestion and slow transactions. The project has raised over $9.8M so far and plans to raise more. One $SOLX is currently available at $0.001598, and you can read more about the project in its whitepaper and by following its X feed . Speaking of $SOLX’s growth, some experts initially believed it might be the next 100x token. However, its latest performance suggests that it could very well soar past 200% from its current presale price. 2025 will probably be its best year. 3. Flockerz ($FLOCK) – Vote-to-Earn Project Nearing $10M in Presale Flockerz ($FLOCK) is a unique vote-to-earn platform that rewards investors with free tokens for sharing their opinions on important platform decisions. For example, the platform might ask which exchange should the token be listed on after presale. The users who share their opinions will be rewarded, regardless of the final decision. Like $WEPE, $FLOCK, too, launched its presale towards the end of 2024 and has managed to raise over $9.5M so far. If you get in right now, you’ll only have to shell out $0.0066883 per $FLOCK token. Interested investors should hurry up because the token is in its final presale stage, which ends in around 10 days. In addition to an impressive 283% staking APY, which is certainly another key attraction for investors, $FLOCK has a sizable following on platforms like X and Telegram . 4. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Proprietary Token of The Fastest-Growing Crypto Wallet in 2025 Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is native to the popular crypto wallet Best Wallet . Holders of these tokens get a wealth of extra benefits, such as lower transaction fees and higher staking rewards. The wallet itself has many interesting features. For example, it gives you access to vetted tokens at presale stage 0, when the prices are their absolute lowest. This project, too, gives investors voting rights, meaning you can influence the direction of the project. What’s more, given that Best Wallet is all set to capture over 40% of the non-custodial wallet market by 2026, there’s no denying $BEST’s potential for massive gains. Currently in presale, $BEST has managed to raise close to $7M. Each token is priced at $0.023575, but prices will increase in the next couple of days. Verdict – Superb Potential, But Not Without Risks It’s important to remember that although these coins have serious potential, most of which is backed by a slew of unique features and not just hype, the crypto scene is pretty volatile – as it has always been. As always, we recommend being very thorough with your own research (DYOR) before ultimately putting your money into the crypto market. Another rule of thumb is to always only spend how much you’re comfortable losing.",Altcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-12 07:15:27

Pepe Rescues Trump (PEPERTRU), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPERTRU is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Rescues Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Rescues Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Rescues Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Rescues Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Rescues Trump by entering its contract address – HtgdKmNDff2UgXmmJYCryKhjVE2F89XMncNt8oThipHz – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPERTRU. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 07:20:00

With the right picks, even a small investment of $500 could grow into a million-dollar portfolio. Among the most promising candidates are BigBossInu, Cardano (ADA), Bitcoin (BTC), Kaspa (KAS), and Arbitrum (ARB). Here’s a closer look at why these digital assets stand out as top choices for exponential growth. BIG BOSS INU’s Hot Presale Ignites Investor Interest BIG BOSS INU is quickly gaining recognition in the crypto scene, with its presale generating immense excitement among early investors. Seen as a high-reward opportunity for those who act fast, BIG BOSS INU is drawing widespread attention. As the excitement around its presale peaks, BIG BOSS INU has emerged as one of the top cryptos to watch this November. Backed by a strong development plan and cutting-edge features, BigBossInu is on track for substantial growth in the near future >>>>>> Cardano (ADA) Although ADA remains well below its all-time peak of $3.09, the crypto community is optimistic about its future prospects. Some improvements are expected to play a crucial role in driving ADA’s value higher as more use cases and applications emerge. Bitcoin’s (BTC) Bitcoin (BTC) continues to hold a strong bullish position, trading near $92,000. Market sentiment indicates the potential for BTC to surge past the $110,000 mark, though possible corrections might bring the price down to support levels around $100,000. Increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin is expected to bolster its upward trajectory further. Kaspa (KAS), currently priced at a modest $0.05, has made waves in the crypto space with its rapid and efficient Proof-of-Work transaction capabilities. Its low-cost entry point is attracting attention from many in the market. However, savvy investors are increasingly looking toward BigBossInu, which not only matches Kaspa’s transaction speeds but also boasts a dynamic growth trajectory. Arbitrum (ARB) is at the forefront of Layer-2 solutions for Ethereum, enhancing its network by offering faster and more cost-effective transactions. Its technology has become a go-to choice for developers looking to build scalable and efficient decentralized applications. >>> Conclusion For those looking to turn a small investment into a fortune, these five altcoins — BIG BOSS INU, Cardano (ADA), Bitcoin (BTC), Kaspa (KAS), and Arbitrum (ARB) — offer a unique mix of technology, scalability, and growth potential. Each of these digital assets has the power to transform a $500 investment into a million-dollar portfolio before the next bull market takes off.

After starting the year with a 20% increase in value, XRP has continued its upward momentum, trading at $2.54 at press time. This marks a near 9% increase from yesterday, highlighting its strong performance despite a period of market consolidation. Amonyx (@amonbuy), a prominent figure in the XRP community, highlighted the asset’s momentum, stating that the “floor has been activated” and asking XRP holders to prepare. Amonyx has consistently supported XRP and the current performance reinforces his bullish sentiment. XRP’s Remarkable Performance XRP outperformed most of its competitors in 2024, with a 300% surge in November and a subsequent climb in December. The cryptocurrency’s price surge brought it to levels not seen since 2018, reaching a peak of $2.86 in early December. According to the TLDR from CoinMarketCap, XRP’s current momentum is driven by its integral role in advancing financial systems and its use in innovative payment solutions. Ripple’s strategic considerations, including the potential launch of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF), further bolster the asset’s position in the market. The announcement of significant leadership changes at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also contributed to the market optimism surrounding XRP. Gary Gensler, the current SEC Chair, has confirmed his resignation effective January 20, 2025. President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkins as his successor. Atkins is widely regarded as a crypto-friendly figure, and his potential leadership has sparked speculation that the new administration could resolve the long-running legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Everyone Is Bullish On XRP Community sentiment within the XRP ecosystem reflects this optimism, as Amonyx received many positive replies and many community members showed excitement and anticipation. Ripple’s broader efforts to expand its influence in the financial sector have also been noteworthy. The company has consistently advocated for regulatory clarity and has positioned XRP as a critical tool for cross-border payments and liquidity solutions. The potential introduction of an XRP-focused ETF is seen as a strategic move to attract institutional investors and reinforce its market standing. Multiple companies have already filed for XRP ETFs, and Ripple President Monica Long believes the new administration could expedite the approval process . With significant developments on the horizon, including the transition to a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, the cryptocurrency appears well-positioned to capitalize on its recent gains.

Analyst Evaluated,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-could-happen-to-bitcoin-price-on-the-day-of-trumps-inauguration-how-will-cryptocurrencies-move-after-trump-analyst-evaluated/,"The cryptocurrency market is bracing for turbulence as the new U.S. administration takes office. The largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is recovering after a shaky start to the year as investors debate the future of crypto under President Trump. Tanaya Macheel, a market analyst, suggests that the first quarter could be a volatile one as conflicting elements of the administration’s agenda come to the fore. A pro-crypto White House and Congress present opportunities for better regulation, while other policies like tariffs that strengthen the US dollar could weigh on Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin rallied over 45% in the month following the election, but tariff concerns have dampened enthusiasm and posed risks to both cryptocurrencies and the broader markets. “This clash between pro-crypto regulation and a stronger dollar shows the dual nature of the administration’s influence on crypto trading,” Macheel said. Related News: Attention Analysis Company Announced! ""If This Metric Fluctuates, Bitcoin Volatility Will Increase A Lot"" Despite the short-term risks, analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term potential. It’s been a year since Bitcoin ETFs were approved, and their growing popularity, combined with regulatory clarity, could boost Bitcoin prices. Some investors believe BTC could double in value by the end of the year, helped by congressional debates on issues like stablecoins and market structure. However, Macheel warned that the effects of any regulatory progress may not be felt until later in the year, leaving room for market uncertainty in the meantime. Phil, a portfolio manager, noted the impact of Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT, the most successful ETF launch in history. However, he noted that a shift occurred last week when the fund recorded its first significant outflow, losing $337 million in a single day. Phil suggested that Bitcoin’s consolidation phase could either lead to higher highs or a temporary shakeout in weak hands. While the inauguration could prompt a “buy the rumor, sell the news” reaction, it could set the stage for a stronger rally. *This is not investment advice.

As more Bitcoin liquidation levels are stacking up, there’s a looming risk that Bitcoin could face downward pressure in the short term. One factor influencing Bitcoin’s price right now is BlackRock’s decision to sell off a large amount of Bitcoin recently. The firm saw a $184 million outflow from its Bitcoin ETFs on Friday. Bitcoin Price Levels: Testing Support and Resistance When it comes to Bitcoin’s price levels, the cryptocurrency is currently facing several challenges. On the weekly chart, analyst Josh of Crypto World said that the price is encountering resistance at a key Fibonacci extension level around $102,000. This level has become a major hurdle for Bitcoin, as it shows a significant point where the price could either bounce back or face further downward pressure. Despite this resistance, Bitcoin is still in a larger bullish trend, as indicated by the SuperTrend indicator, which remains in the green. However, there’s a bearish divergence forming on the weekly chart, signaling that the bullish momentum may be slowing down. This divergence suggests that Bitcoin could experience a cooldown, which might lead to short-term price pullbacks or sideways movement. Important Short-Term Targets A key price range to watch is between $96,300 and $100,518, which may act as a resistance zone for a potential corrective rally. If Bitcoin can break above $100,518, it may mean a shift toward higher targets. Alternatively, there is a scenario where Bitcoin could hit a Fibonacci extension level of $87,748, which could serve as a potential low for the correction, though this remains less likely. Whether Bitcoin continues its bullish run or faces a short-term correction, traders should be paying close attention to the support and resistance levels discussed above.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-12 07:53:47

According to the US Office of Government Ethics, Bessent will have to relinquish his position at the hedge fund immediately after the Senate’s approval. However, for his shares, he’d have a 90-day window post-confirmation to divest them. Bessent revealed his assets, valued at more than $500 million State officials must report their assets and provide plans to divest holdings that could present conflicts of interest before the Senate confirms them. Bessent’s hearing is set for Thursday next week, and he will be required to reveal his holdings. His publicly disclosed personal financial statement shows his assets are valued at $521 million. Among his highest-valued holdings are two tranches of US Treasury bills, two Invesco funds, and foreign currency positions linked to the Key Square Group. He also acknowledged his personal investment at an iShares Bitcoin ETF, worth about $500,000, which he will need to divest post-confirmation. Other assets include a $25 million farmland in North Dakota, a $25 million Bahamian property, and at least $1 million worth of art and antiques. In his letter to the Treasury Department’s ethics office, Bessent made it clear that he plans to shut down the investment firm Key Square Capital Management, resign from the Bessent-Freeman Family Foundation, and relinquish his role at Rockefeller University as chairman of the investment committee post-confirmation. He will also sell several other investments, such as his stake at All Seasons, a conservative book publishing company. Bessent will help Trump with his pro-crypto agenda Scott Bessent emerged as the top pick for the treasury secretary seat, edging out competitors like Apollo Global Management Inc. executive Marc Rowan, former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty, and Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick. If he earns Senate approval, Bessent is expected to aid Trump in rolling out tax cuts, imposing new tariffs, and renegotiating some trade deals. Given his experience with digital assets, Bessent is also projected to play a vital role in pushing for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, especially with Trump proposing the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve.

While this consolidation phase has left many investors nervous about a potential deeper correction, some even speculating that BTC may have already peaked, key metrics paint a more optimistic picture. CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler shared a compelling chart showing the market sentiment and price correlation. Offering valuable insights into the market’s current state. According to Adler, the market will become overheated only when the index featured in the chart reaches the 95th percentile—a level that historically signals the beginning of a correction phase. Encouragingly, the market remains well below this threshold, suggesting there is still room for further upside before hitting critical resistance. This analysis aligns with the broader sentiment among long-term investors, who view the current consolidation as a healthy pause in Bitcoin’s upward trajectory . As BTC holds above key support levels, all eyes are on its ability to break back above $95K and reclaim the psychological $100K mark, potentially setting the stage for another significant rally. Bitcoin Awaiting Decisive Move After weeks of consolidation below the pivotal $100K mark, Bitcoin is finding strong demand above the $92K level, signaling resilience amidst market uncertainty. Analysts are closely monitoring this level as BTC approaches a critical juncture, with expectations for a decisive move. Whether the price breaks above $100K or dips below $90K remains to be seen, but the stakes are high as investors prepare for significant volatility. Adler recently shared insightful data and analysis , highlighting key metrics that should be tracked throughout the year to anticipate market shifts. Adler revealed that the market will reach an overheated state when the Market Sentiment and Price Correlation index climbs to the 95th percentile. Historically, this level has signaled the onset of major corrections, making it a crucial threshold to watch. Adler emphasizes three key indicators to monitor as the index approaches this critical level: Long-Term Holder (LTH) sales, ETF outflows, and investor behavior concerning MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares. These signals, when aligned, are likely to mark the beginning of a correction phase. For now, Bitcoin remains in a holding pattern, with strong demand propping up its price, but the next major move could set the tone for the rest of the year. Critical Levels To Watch Bitcoin is currently trading at $94,500, holding above key support but facing challenges to regain bullish momentum. For the bulls to take control, reclaiming the $95,000 mark is the first step. However, this alone won’t suffice. To confirm a sustained uptrend, BTC must push above the $98,000 and $100,000 levels in the coming days. The $100K level remains a psychological and technical barrier. Breaking above it is critical, but to solidify the uptrend, Bitcoin must hold above this mark for several days. A sustained presence above $100K would provide confidence to market participants and signal the continuation of the bullish structure. On the flip side, failure to reclaim these crucial levels could result in further downside. If BTC struggles to move past the $95,000 mark and fails to retake the $98K and $100K levels, a drop below the $92,000 support becomes increasingly likely. Such a scenario would expose Bitcoin to deeper corrections, potentially targeting the $85,000 demand zone. The next few days will be pivotal as BTC navigates a tight trading range. Whether bulls can reclaim control or bears push prices lower will set the tone for the weeks ahead.

Catslap ($SLAP) is a one-of-a-kind meme coin where all token holders can earn slap points by just slapping their favorite characters on the homepage. The more the number of slaps, the more points you get. Each of the top 10 slappers will get a $10K USDT airdrop. Even if you do not make it to the top 10, you’ll get $SLAP tokens as per your position on the leaderboard. However, there was another dimension to this challenge – completing tasks on Zealy. For those unaware, Zealy is a tasking-questing platform used by brands to build a community through a reward-based system. Catslap enthusiasts were required to join the Catslap Zealy page and complete social and on-chain tasks to earn Zealy points. These points weigh more than the slap points. One point on Zealy is equal to 1000 slap points. The more tasks you complete on Zealy, the higher your chances of making it to the top 10. This means that there are two leaderboards: one with the slap points and one with Zealy points. As per the Catslap team’s Telegram communication, the Zealy points will be converted into slap points to arrive at the final leaderboard list on Tuesday. Now, although you could have used any EVM-compatible crypto wallet to participate in these two challenges, you need a Best Wallet crypto address to claim your rewards. In fact, Catslap has an affiliation with Best Wallet , where you can buy the token directly from Best Wallet. Is It a Good Time to Buy the Catslap Dip? Catslap ($SLAP) launched on the MEXC exchange on December 6 and made a high of $0.010546, delivering 251% returns on the same day. Early investors made as much as 4x on their investments. Since then, the coin has seen a 68% dip in prices and is currently trading below its opening price on the listing date. This begs the question of whether it’s a good time to buy the dip. Catslap is a community-driven meme coin launched directly on decentralized exchange to compete with the likes of $POPCAT. It started 2025 on a positive note with 45% gains in the first week. And now, the price may just be ripe for a fresh entry in what’s a high-potential meme coin. We say so for several reasons. Firstly, Catslap plans to burn $1M $SLAP tokens on January 31. It has already burnt $1.18M worth of tokens so far. Burning tokens rebalances the demand and supply forces, leading the prices to go up. Secondly, Catslap has an active buyback program in place where it buys back tokens from the open market. So far, $883,637.54 worth of $SLAP tokens have been bought back. Just like token burning, buying back tokens also strengthens the price of the underlying asset by controlling the supply. Plus, there’s an active staking program where token holders can earn up to 30% APY on their staked tokens. Verdict – Onwards and Upwards for $SLAP All these are positive signs for this small-cap meme coin. This shows the dedication of the founders to make Catslap one of the biggest meme coins going around. It has an active following of over 12K members on X , besides an active Telegram community. Moreover, it has also been audited by SolidProof and has a good TrustNet Score of 60.30, indicating that it’s a very trustworthy asset in the Web3 space. It’s worth noting that $SLAP has already made a return of 2,360% for investors, and you may not get the opportunity to buy Catslap at a current price of $0.002376 again. However, as always, this isn’t investment advice. Also, we highly recommend doing your own research (DYOR) before you part with your money.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-12 08:00:51

In a new strategy session on YouTube, the pseudonymous trader known as DonAlt tells his 65,000 subscribers that price targets for BTC above $150,000 are likely too aggressive. DonAlt also says that he’s anticipating an end to the market cycle in the next couple of months, rather than targeting a late-2025 peak that some analysts are forecasting. “I would like to see a last leg for everything. Like an aggressive last leg. Bitcoin to like $150,000, I think that’s already a tall ask, if everything goes crazy maybe it doubles but I don’t think this cycle we’re going to see more than $200,000, I think $150,000 would be a lot already. So Bitcoin [could go] another 10-20-30-40-50% if it goes really well. I think at that point you’re stretching it, and $100,000 is already basically the target that makes the most sense, everything else is a little bit more aggressive. I hope we’re going to see a little bit of an altcoin rotation at the end of it. That’s kind of where my mind’s set but let’s see, it’s hard to predict this time around. I think time-wise, I don’t give it much more than a couple of months, at best, for this cycle to end. I could be wrong, we’ll see how it goes.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,586.
