Yet the narrative isn’t one of panic, but accumulation. While ETH itself is still targeting the $6,000 mark in this cycle, whales are zooming out and funneling serious capital into Ethereum ecosystem tokens like Ethena (ENA) and AAVE (AAVE), altcoins with slightly better stronger risk-reward upside. However, all eyes are on the newly-launched Ethereum L2 scalability solution with memecoin appeal in the form of Layer Brett ($LBRETT) and its crypto presale. If these tokens capture a fraction of institutional inflows entering ETH, the multiples could vastly outpace the parent chain—especially $LBRETT. Here’s why. Ethereum remains the anchor, but growth shifts to its ecosystem Ethereum (ETH) has cemented itself as the cornerstone of decentralized finance and Web3, with its robust smart contracts, deep liquidity, and dominance in DeFi and NFT sectors. Predictions calling for ETH to reclaim $6,000 this year are not far-fetched, especially as ETF approvals open the floodgates of institutional demand. However, ETH’s trillion-dollar trajectory means capital is flowing downstream into Ethereum ecosystem tokens with smaller caps. Why whales are eyeing Ethena Ethena has emerged as one of the most discussed Ethereum ecosystem plays, driven by its synthetic dollar protocol. Whales are accumulating heavily because ENA represents a critical piece of crypto infrastructure at scale. On-chain data shows spikes in whale wallet positioning, a clear signal that institutional capital views ENA as more than just a DeFi coin — it’s a bet on Ethereum’s growth multiplier. If ETH doubles, ENA could be 10x under favorable liquidity conditions. Aave: Still a DeFi stalwart after all these years Aave remains a titan of DeFi lending, and its reputation as one of the earliest top DeFi tokens gives it credibility with both retail and institutional investors. Whales are snapping up positions in anticipation of growing lending and borrowing demand. Compared to ETH, AAVE’s smaller market cap makes it leaner—a 2x-4x return in the next year is within reach, particularly if ETH ETFs bring in billions in liquidity. Layer Brett: Where meme energy meets Ethereum L2 scalability While ETH, ENA, and AAVE offer varying degrees of upside, Layer Brett is the breakout star drawing smart money attention. At just $0.0053 in its crypto presale, $LBRETT is rapidly approaching the $2M milestone, a clear sign of surging investor FOMO. Positioned as an Ethereum Layer 2 memecoin, it fuses viral meme power with genuine blockchain utility—near-instant transactions, low gas fees, and a robust staking ecosystem. Its staking crypto rewards are off the charts (1,300%+ APY), its tokenomics are transparent, and its design makes it perfectly positioned to absorb the wave of institutional inflows. For retail investors priced out of Ethereum, Ethena, or AAVE, Layer Brett provides a high-beta vehicle to ride Ethereum’s growth narrative without being capped by trillion-dollar valuations. The smart money is rotating towards $LBRETT So while headlines fret over ETH’s weekly dip, whales are quietly accumulating ENA, AAVE, and $LBRETT. Ethereum price predictions to $6,000 are bullish, but the real ROI potential lies in smaller-cap plays tied to Ethereum’s ecosystem. With its viral branding, meme coin energy, and Ethereum core infrastructure backbone, Layer Brett stands out as the coin most likely to go on a parabolic run. Ultimately, the narrative isn’t simply about ETH bouncing back to $6K. It’s about recognizing that the Ethereum price prediction story is now a slow-burn institutional play. The parabolic action is in the altcoin space around ETH that captures both retail imagination and whale money. That’s where we find the most interesting opportunity today: Layer Brett. LBRETT is available now at $0.0053. Don’t miss out on the next 100x—join the Layer Brett presale today.

In a truly pivotal development, major investment firms are accumulating Bitcoin at a pace that rivals the entire annual mining output. This unprecedented demand suggests a profound shift in how traditional finance views the leading digital asset, potentially signaling a new era of adoption and market stability. Why is Institutional Bitcoin Buying Surging Now? Recent data reveals a fascinating trend. Over July and August alone, 28 new strategic investment firms collectively acquired a staggering 140,000 BTC. This amount is nearly equivalent to the average annual Bitcoin mining supply, which stands at approximately 164,000 BTC. This rapid accumulation highlights a growing confidence among institutional players. Overlooked Demand: Andre Dragosch, Head of Research for Europe at Bitwise, explains that many forecasts predicting a Bitcoin cycle peak and subsequent decline this year overlooked the sheer scale of institutional demand. Massive Annual Influx: Institutions have purchased an astounding 690,000 BTC this year. This figure is 6.3 times the annual supply, demonstrating a sustained and aggressive appetite for Bitcoin. Retail Confidence: It is not just institutions; retail investors have also continued their buying spree. This broad-based accumulation signals robust market health. This sustained institutional Bitcoin buying suggests a long-term strategic play rather than short-term speculation. Firms are likely positioning themselves for future growth, viewing Bitcoin as a crucial component of diversified portfolios. The Impact of Institutional Bitcoin Buying on Market Dynamics The sheer volume of institutional capital flowing into Bitcoin has profound implications for the market. When large entities commit significant resources, it often lends greater legitimacy and stability to an asset class. For Bitcoin, this means a stronger foundation and increased mainstream acceptance. The BTC Average Accumulation Score indicator provides further insight. Dragosch noted that buying activity across all Bitcoin wallets is currently at its strongest level since April. This indicator tracks the accumulation behavior of various wallet sizes, reinforcing the narrative of widespread, strong demand. Benefits of this Trend: Enhanced Legitimacy: Increased institutional participation helps validate Bitcoin as a serious asset class, attracting more mainstream attention. Reduced Volatility: While Bitcoin is known for its price swings, large institutional holdings can potentially provide a stabilizing force, as these entities often have longer investment horizons. Increased Liquidity: More participants, especially large ones, contribute to deeper liquidity pools, making it easier to buy and sell without significant price impact. However, challenges can arise. Increased institutional influence might lead to greater correlation with traditional markets, potentially diluting Bitcoin’s role as a truly uncorrelated asset. Regulatory scrutiny could also intensify as the asset gains more prominence in traditional finance. What Does This Institutional Bitcoin Buying Mean for Retail Investors? For individual investors, the surge in institutional Bitcoin buying offers both reassurance and potential opportunities. It suggests that the ‘smart money’ is increasingly confident in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Retail investors, who have historically been early adopters, now see their convictions echoed by major financial players. Actionable Insights for Retail Investors: Stay Informed: Monitor institutional flows and market sentiment to understand broader trends. Long-Term Perspective: The institutional interest reinforces the idea of Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate volatility. Risk Management: While institutional backing is positive, Bitcoin remains a volatile asset. Diversify your portfolio and invest only what you can afford to lose. The continued buying from both institutional and retail sectors creates a powerful synergy. It demonstrates that Bitcoin’s appeal is not limited to one group but resonates across the entire investment spectrum. Navigating the Future of Bitcoin: Insights and Outlook The current wave of institutional Bitcoin buying is a critical indicator of Bitcoin’s evolving position in the global financial landscape. It challenges previous bearish outlooks and underscores a robust, growing demand that many analysts initially underestimated. As more strategic investment firms enter the market, Bitcoin’s infrastructure and regulatory environment are likely to mature further. The future looks promising, with sustained institutional interest potentially driving innovation, fostering greater market efficiency, and cementing Bitcoin’s role as a formidable digital asset. This period of intense accumulation could be a precursor to significant price movements, reinforcing the asset’s trajectory towards mainstream integration. In conclusion, the astounding rate of institutional Bitcoin buying , eclipsing annual mining output and far surpassing previous expectations, marks a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency market. This robust demand, coupled with continued retail interest, paints a compelling picture of a resilient and increasingly legitimate asset. As institutions continue to pour capital into Bitcoin, its path towards broader adoption and long-term stability appears more certain than ever. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is institutional Bitcoin buying? Institutional Bitcoin buying refers to the acquisition of Bitcoin by large financial entities such as hedge funds, asset management firms, corporations, and other strategic investment vehicles, as opposed to individual retail investors. How much Bitcoin have institutions bought recently? In July and August alone, 28 new strategic investment firms acquired 140,000 BTC. This amount is nearly equivalent to the average annual Bitcoin mining output of 164,000 BTC. This year, institutions have purchased 690,000 BTC, which is 6.3 times the annual supply. Why is institutional demand important for Bitcoin? Institutional demand brings significant capital, enhances Bitcoin’s legitimacy as a serious asset class, can contribute to market stability, and helps integrate it further into the traditional financial system. It signals a long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s value. Does retail buying still matter with so much institutional interest? Absolutely. Retail buying continues to be a crucial component of Bitcoin’s market strength. The sustained interest from individual investors, alongside institutional demand, creates a broad and resilient base for the asset. What is the BTC Average Accumulation Score indicator? The BTC Average Accumulation Score is an on-chain metric that tracks the accumulation or distribution behavior across different Bitcoin wallet sizes.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $11.14. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $27.9 and $33.66, with an average value of $28.88. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.7033 Market Cap $1.25B Trading Volume $100.42M Circulating Supply 1.778B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.7188 24-hour Low $0.6974 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.53% 50-Day SMA $0.7436 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 48 (Neutral) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $0.9528 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: The daily trend remains weak below $0.74 mid Bollinger band. OP’s immediate support is present at $0.70. Optimism 1-day price chart OP continues to drift sideways on August 31 after failing to reclaim the mid-Bollinger at $0.7396. Price hovers near $0.70 with lower highs intact, while the lower band around $0.6458 is the next support. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains bearish with the histogram still negative, and the RSI is neutral at 49, reflecting indecision. Resistance sits first at $0.74 and more strongly at $0.83, but unless $0.70 holds, momentum risks shifting lower toward $0.65. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour chart, OP trades slightly above the $0.6981 support, with resistance stacked at $0.711 and $0.722. The 21-period SMA near $0.707 is flat, showing a lack of trend. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The price action is choppy with repeated rejections at $0.71, while volume has tapered off from the prior push. If $0.70 fails, a drop to $0.681 becomes likely; otherwise, bulls need a clean close above $0.711 to retest $0.722. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3861 BUY SMA 5 $0.4010 BUY SMA 10 $0.3980 BUY SMA 21 $0.3960 BUY SMA 50 $0.3977 BUY SMA 100 $0.3798 BUY SMA 200 $0.4278 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3875 BUY EMA 5 $0.3841 BUY EMA 10 $0.3797 BUY EMA 21 $0.3808 BUY EMA 50 $0.4110 BUY EMA 100 $0.4779 SELL EMA 200 $0.5583 SELL What to expect from Optimism? As long as OP stays capped under $0.74, the path of least resistance leans lower. Traders should watch $0.70 for support retention; otherwise $0.68–0.65 could be tested before any meaningful recovery attempt. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Optimism historic price sentiment Optimism price history by Coingecko OP launched with an initial value of $4.57 on May 31 but dropped sharply in June due to the UST stablecoin de-pegging and LUNA collapse, closing June at $0.5434. It further declined to $0.4147 by mid-July. In August, OP briefly surged above $1.90, but by mid-October, it dropped to $0.70 following the FTX collapse. In Q1 2023, OP surged past $3.00 during a crypto bull run but lost 66% shortly after. A recovery saw it close the year at $3.90. OP saw an eventful 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.85 in March before sliding below $2.30 by mid-April. After a brief recovery to over $2.90 in May, it entered a bearish phase, trading at $1.82–$1.96 by July and $1.54–$1.62 by October. November brought a spark of hope with a peak at $2.60. OP closed December within the range of $1.611–$2.773. In January 2025, OP peaked at $2.18 but lost momentum, dropping to as low as $0.84 in February. OP peaked at $0.9346 in March, $0.8523 in May, $0.7478 in June, and in July, $0.86.

50986833,https://timestabloid.com/?p=80975,1756681243,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"5 Best Altcoins to Buy for the Next Cycle — DOGE, NEAR and a $0.004 Gem",https://timestabloid.com/5-best-altcoins-to-buy-for-the-next-cycle-doge-near/,"The upcoming cycle is already drawing attention to a handful of altcoins that combine strong fundamentals, retail enthusiasm, and institutional interest. From established giants like Ethereum and Solana to meme-fueled momentum in Dogecoin and rising infrastructure plays like NEAR Protocol, analysts are narrowing in on five names that stand out as the best positioned for 2025. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing particular interest as a $0.004 presale gem, riding whale inflows and early community adoption. Dogecoin (DOGE) — Meme Power and Retail Loyalty Dogecoin remains the most recognizable meme coin and continues to thrive on community-driven demand. Despite its origins as a joke, DOGE has proven remarkably resilient through market cycles. Analysts say loyal holders, combined with renewed payment use cases, are keeping momentum alive. Price projections for the next cycle suggest DOGE could push toward $1.58 in highly bullish conditions. That may sound ambitious, but it reflects the coin’s history of defying expectations. Payment integrations and ongoing visibility on social platforms ensure that Dogecoin remains a speculative favorite among traders seeking exposure to meme-driven rallies. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) — A Scalable Layer 1 NEAR Protocol has been flagged as one of the most promising smart contract platforms going into 2025. Its scalability, strong developer base, and clear integration roadmap position it as a top contender in the Layer 1 space. Analysts highlight NEAR’s focus on real-world integrations and cross-chain compatibility as potential growth drivers. As competition between blockchains intensifies, NEAR is well placed to capture developer attention and user adoption. This makes it a strong buy for investors who want exposure to the next generation of infrastructure projects. Ethereum (ETH) — Institutional Anchor Ethereum continues to hold its place as the default smart contract platform. Following the rollout of proto-danksharding and the approval of spot ETH ETFs, Ethereum has solidified its reputation as the “macro trade” in crypto. Institutions are pouring billions into ETH-backed products, and analysts forecast prices in the $7,500 to $10,000 range by late 2025. With its deep DeFi ecosystem and unmatched developer activity, Ethereum remains a foundation asset for both retail and institutional portfolios. While it may not deliver the extreme multiples of smaller-cap tokens, it offers long-term stability and legitimacy that few other altcoins can match. Solana (SOL) — Speed, Scale, and Consumer Growth Solana continues to surge as one of the fastest and most consumer-ready blockchains. Capable of handling ultra-fast transactions at negligible costs, it has become a go-to network for NFTs, DeFi, and gaming. The approval of a Solana ETF has further legitimized the network, attracting steady institutional flows. Price forecasts for Solana range from $200 to $1,000 in the next cycle. Analysts attribute this bullishness to surging developer activity and ecosystem expansion. For traders seeking scalability and strong adoption narratives, Solana remains a clear candidate for inclusion in any 2025 portfolio. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGACOIN) — The $0.004 Gem While majors like DOGE, NEAR, ETH, and SOL provide proven foundations, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as the cycle’s hidden gem. Smart money wallets are rotating out of blue-chip names into this $0.004 presale, signaling early conviction in its upside potential. Backed by a full Hashex audit and whale-sized allocations, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already being described by analysts as one of the best altcoins to buy before the market’s next leg higher. Unlike typical meme coins that rely solely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting whales, Reddit communities, and meme traders alike. The buzz has made it one of the most talked-about presales in 2025, with projections ranging from 15x to as much as 60x in upside. Its positioning as a best crypto presale for the year reflects both early demand and growing recognition across retail and institutional circles. For investors looking beyond the majors, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents a chance to secure early exposure before broader adoption drives valuations higher. Conclusion — Five Strong Narratives for 2025 The five best altcoins for the next cycle capture different sides of crypto’s growth story. Dogecoin leverages meme loyalty, NEAR Protocol offers scalable infrastructure, Ethereum anchors institutional flows, and Solana delivers speed and consumer growth. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is breaking through as an audited under $0.004 gem that could deliver outsized multiples.

That’s the largest current account deficit ever recorded. The plunge came as goods exports collapsed and foreign capital rushed out. The current account includes trade, cross-border services, investment income, and transfers, and right now, every piece is flashing red. Exports of goods fell 13.1%, the steepest quarterly drop in years, dragging total export values to the lowest since 2021. Canada’s trade deficit in physical goods also hit a record C$19.60 billion. The damage was mainly from a slump in shipments to the United States, Canada’s biggest trading partner and now its biggest problem. Trump’s tariffs hammer exports, car shipments plunge The economic hit came after U.S. President Donald Trump reimposed sweeping tariffs on Canadian goods, targeting steel, aluminum, and automobiles. That decision, announced in late Q1, began biting hard in Q2. Canadian exports to the U.S. collapsed, dragging the broader export numbers with them. Total exports shrank by 7.5%, reversing earlier gains made in Q1. The hardest fall came from international sales of passenger cars and light trucks, which tanked by almost 25%. The ripple effect hit GDP. The Canadian economy shrank 1.6% in the quarter on an annualized basis. That’s nearly three times worse than the 0.6% contraction economists were expecting in a Refinitiv poll. This followed a 2% drop in the first quarter, meaning Canada has now posted two straight quarters of contraction, meeting the textbook definition of a recession. Nathan Janzen, assistant chief economist at the Royal Bank of Canada, said the headline numbers were “obviously weaker than expected.” He blamed a “huge” drop in exports and a sharp decline in U.S. imports. “Trade-exposed sectors have weakened and business investment fell, largely as expected,” Janzen said, adding that “consumer spending was significantly firmer than expected.” Carney ditches retaliation, rate cut expectations climb Prime Minister Mark Carney, who took office in April, abandoned Canada’s retaliatory trade measures in June after months of failed talks with the Trump administration. The tariffs remain in place. Carney made the move to cool tensions, but it hasn’t improved trade flows so far. During his campaign, he had promised to make Canada the most resilient G7 economy and cut dependence on the U.S. That promise now looks shaky. The economic pressure has also shifted to the Bank of Canada. Markets are now betting on a 55% chance of a rate cut at the next policy meeting on September 17. TD Bank economist Rishi Sondhi said on Friday that “one [rate cut] taking place by year’s end is fully priced in.” The central bank has held rates steady this year, but worsening trade conditions and weak output figures may force its hand. Meanwhile, money is fleeing the country. Canada is facing record net capital outflows as investors seek stability elsewhere. That adds more pain to an already fragile balance sheet and puts more downward pressure on the loonie. Robert Asselin, chief executive of U15, a group of Canada’s top research universities, said the GDP hit should be seen as “short-term pain.” But he warned that Canada must stop relying on reactionary policy and instead invest in real capabilities. “Canada must focus on building sovereign capabilities and do much better on the industrial policy front,” Asselin said. “We have strength in advanced research but it is not aligned with industry.” Get seen where it counts.

His recent activity on X (formerly Twitter) suggests that another major acquisition could be on the horizon, sparking excitement among investors and analysts alike. What’s Driving Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Strategy? Saylor’s latest post featured his well-known “Saylor Tracker” chart, accompanied by the intriguing comment that “BTC is still on sale.” This isn’t a new tactic; historically, such posts have often preceded substantial Bitcoin acquisitions by MicroStrategy, a pattern closely watched by the market.

Boosted Sentiment: A positive signal for the broader cryptocurrency market. Validation: Further validates Bitcoin as a legitimate and essential asset class for corporate treasuries. Strategic Play: Reinforces the “buy the dip” mentality for long-term holders and strategic investors.

House of Doge’s $200M treasury approval and Grayscale’s Cardano ETF filing spotlight how innovative moves can reshape crypto investment opportunities today. Mirroring the performance of these projects is Remittix (RTX) , an altcoin that is making a name for itself as a unique, payments-focused DeFi project. With its presale gaining momentum, RTX is already being hailed as the best crypto to buy now in 2025. Dogecoin and Cardano: Household Names in the Market Dogecoin remains one of the most recognized tokens in the meme coin space. Rising 6.7% in trading volume to $2.15B, DOGE is showing durability. According to analysts, support above $0.200 maintains bullish configurations, with targets at $0.230 and $0.246. Its meme-fueled community continues to propel adoption, but investors are also wondering if Dogecoin’s use case stacks up against newer crypto projects. Cardano, on the other hand, has been a solid long-term investment prospect in the cryptocurrency space. ADA is priced at about $0.82 following a decline of over 9.3% in the past seven days. Yet, ADA shows promising prospects with Grayscale’s recent Cardano spot ETF filing alongside Polkadot. Hence, the project remains well-liked for its eco-friendly blockchain and presence in future crypto projects. The two coins illustrate why most investors strike a balance between well-established tokens and early cryptos. Why Remittix Stands Out The Remittix presale is not just another ICO; currently priced at $0.10 per token , it has already raised over $22.3 million with more than 630 million tokens sold. The project addresses a $ 19 trillion global payments problem by enabling direct crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries. With its low gas fee and focus on real-world adoption, Remittix offers a practical use case that is often lacking in speculative tokens. Some of the highlights of the developments are: First exchange listings obtained with BitMart and LBank Q3 beta wallet launch with real-time FX conversion CertiK audit completed, building more trust $250,000 giveaway to further engage the community These milestones reflect how Remittix is combining utility with strong presale momentum, setting it apart from meme-driven hype. The Bigger Picture for 2025 The crypto market thrives on the presence of legacy projects and new faces. While Dogecoin and Cardano lead among some of the top crypto under $1, Remittix demonstrates what an interesting new altcoin to follow can look like. It incorporates payment use cases, low fees, and a growing ecosystem into one of the strongest crypto presale stories of 2025. For investors seeking the best altcoins to buy now, the key lies in diversification. More established tokens like ADA and DOGE bring stability, but getting in early on Remittix exposes you to a high-growth crypto with a base of real adoption. With wallet releases, CEX listings, and community growth to follow, RTX will be one of the best long-term crypto investments for the next cycle.

With Bitcoin stuck at $110,000, some investors are switching to alternative coins that they believe are worth investing in now and could gain significant attention soon, aiming to achieve the same level of success as Bitcoin and potentially reap substantial profits. XRP and Litecoin remain among the market’s most prominent names to add to a buy list. Legacy players aren’t the end of the story, for there is a growing noise amidst newer projects. They are closely examining MAGACOIN FINANCE because it has the potential to provide exponential returns. Litecoin: the veteran with renewed relevance The value of Litecoin has quietly regained its former importance recently. Faster transfers and cheaper fees have kept users active with Litecoin for a long time. The combination of Bitcoin and PayPal’s cryptocurrency further increased usability, which may further favour Bitcoin on Main Street. Analysts believe that while Litecoin’s potential may not overshadow newer altcoins, it still offers a stable and secure means of saving value for those seeking alternative payment options that are cheaper than Bitcoin. At a time when predictable measures are necessary, Litecoin strikes a delicate balance between adaptability and security. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a more likely outcome compared to the rest. Unique for its blending of political advertising and audit-approved legitimacy, it gains cultural support alongside structural trust. In this project, investors can be assured that their contracts are secure, a rare occurrence in this field. The ability of MAGACOIN FINANCE to turn narratives into actual movements lies within its strength. In contrast to some other cryptocurrencies, which focus on bigger business and market targets, the project’s primary source of energy comes from ordinary individuals. MAGACOIN FINANCE has combined its frenzy with a clear system, comprising a finite supply and specific token rules. Analysts’ expectations have surpassed previous predictions due to new methods and the increased credibility of audit reports. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers an uncommon opportunity for investors to take part in an endeavor with potential that has endured critical assessment. XRP: regulatory clarity fuels confidence Few tokens have benefited from regulatory clarity like XRP. A major partial court victory for Ripple against the financial regulators in 2023 created new legitimacy for business. Following this move, adoption has been on a steady rise in that part of the world with ongoing cross-border payouts using the Ripple System. Analysts are expecting a positive future for Ripple, predicting it rise to eleven dollars and fifty cents by 2028. Investors have taken particular notice of XRP due to its unique position in combining regulatory backing and a strong potential in global payment transactions. Why the mix matters Selecting the correct cryptocurrency is more about seeking balance than solely aiming to maximise profit. Ripple has developed a digital asset. This currency makes sure that payments are delivered. And MAGACOIN FINANCE adds high reward to the finance portfolio with potentially unfair gain. Together, stability, utility, and momentum have been combined to create an investment strategy that incorporates three key elements: stability, utility, and momentum. Conclusion Some opportunities can be detected despite market unpredictability. Among digital currencies, XRP is dominating cross-border, Litecoin remains stable, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is the up-and-coming retail leader, thanks to their innovative combination of cultural branding and financially backed credibility. Analysts who suggest a 50 times potential increase aren’t just jumping on a trend; they’re realising an exceptional opportunity in the combination of high growth and well defined plan. The ideal investment portfolios should include a balance of stable coins such as XRP and Litecoin, and new and potential coins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, for maximum return on investment.

Per an official Gumi release and a report from the Japanese media outlet CoinPost , the Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed firm’s board of directors has signed off on the move. The firm said it aims to complete the purchase before the end of February next year. Gumi’s largest shareholder is SBI Holdings. Gumi: XRP and BTC Are ‘Two Pillars’ of Our Financial Strategy SBI is a long-term partner of the XRP issuer Ripple, and an ardent advocate of the altcoin. But Gumi has also proven to be extremely Bitcoin-keen. Gumi (TYO: 3903) share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange over the past month. (Source: Google Finance) The firm announced plans to buy over $6.5 million worth of Bitcoin back in February . And in March this year, Gumi held a $106,000 BTC lottery event for its newest shareholders . Gumi officials said that the future XRP buy is not purely speculative. Instead, it called the move a “strategic initiative” that would allow it to move into the financial sector. The company claimed its move would help it participate in the XRP ecosystem. This ecosystem, officials aid, is now playing a central role in international remittances and liquidity networks. Developing cross-border remittances and liquidity are values “at the core of” SBI’s operations, Gumi noted. XRP will thus take on “great significance” as a medium- to long-term growth asset, Gumi believes. Gumi has also unveiled plans to launch a multi-billion yen crypto management fund in conjunction with SBI. The $300B stablecoin market is set to grow into the trillions. Together with @sbivc_official , we’re bringing $RLUSD to Japan in early 2026, offering users and institutions a trusted, regulated and fully-backed stablecoin built for enterprise use cases. https://t.co/htcrMiQkTe — Ripple (@Ripple) August 22, 2025 SBI: Aiming for Crypto ETF SBI wants to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that incorporates BTC, XRP, and other tokens. The firm is currently waiting on approval from Tokyo, which continues to deliberate on crypto ETF appoval. Gumi has also said that it will look to manage its Bitcoin holdings by using staking protocols. The company has also explained that it sees BTC and XRP as two separate pillars of its growth strategy. XRP, it said, is a “network asset that is rooted in real financial demand.” Bitcoin, meanwhile, is a “globally universal asset,” Gumi believes.

But the real buzz on CT and Reddit is focused on Layer Brett ($LBRETT) — a new Ethereum Layer 2 memecoin whose presale is closing in on the $2M milestone at just $0.0053 per token. For early investors, the combination of meme coin virality with Ethereum Layer 2 infrastructure is being hyped as a “can’t-miss asymmetric play” going into 2025. BNB price prediction: Why BNB bulls eye modest gains When it comes to BNB price predictions, analysts remain measured. Binance Coin still powers one of the largest exchanges in the world, and BNB’s role in token burns, transaction fees, and DeFi staking keeps it relevant. However, BNB has become a “value stock” — steady but unlikely to deliver explosive ROI. The most optimistic projections put BNB at a 2x or 3x in the next bull run, respectable but modest compared to the triple-digit gains smaller-cap assets can offer. Pi Network update: New all-time lows after delisting rumors The Pi Network update has created more confusion than excitement. While Pi aimed to democratize mining with its mobile-first approach, the recent wave of rumored exchange delistings has had Pi Network token prices hitting new all-time lows of $0.33, or a 88% decline from its February 2025 peak of $2.98. For many, Pi has gone from being a grassroots retail darling to an asset clouded by doubt, with upside potential diminished by weak fundamentals and shaky exchange support. Layer Brett: Where explosive memecoin appeal meets mechanism What makes Layer Brett different is its hybrid DNA. It’s not just a meme token—it’s built as an Ethereum Layer 2 crypto, offering low gas fees, near-instant settlements, and staking rewards that dwarf traditional DeFi yields. Early buyers are locking in thousands of percent APY through staking, and the presale’s rapid climb toward $2 million raised signals serious momentum. Unlike BNB, which functions as a mature exchange coin, or Pi Network, which still struggles for legitimacy, $LBRETT blends meme culture with core Ethereum infrastructure utility. It represents a “high-beta Ethereum-adjacent project,” giving investors exposure to Ethereum’s growing dominance while amplifying returns with meme-driven virality. And unlike Dogecoin, which thrives purely on nostalgia and celebrity tweets, Layer Brett has a working roadmap: staking dApps, NFT integrations, community campaigns, and interoperable bridging solutions that connect Ethereum with broader Web3 ecosystems. This balance of fun and function is why the smart money is calling $LBRETT the best crypto presale on the board right now. Layer Brett offers the best upside as the top crypto presale of 2025 Ultimately, BNB price predictions point to stability, not exponential growth. Pi Network updates have done little to restore confidence after delistings. That’s why momentum is flowing into Layer Brett . At just $0.0053 per token and closing in on $2M raised, it offers investors a rare chance to get in early on what many believe could be the next 100x meme coin — only this time with real infrastructure baked in. For those hunting asymmetric upside in 2025, Layer Brett may be the move that defines the next cycle. LBRETT is available now at $0.0053. Don’t miss out on the next 100x—join the Layer Brett presale today.

With XRP showing a bull-flag breakout pattern and Ethereum demonstrating consistent price strength, the market’s next big rotation could decide which asset dominates institutional portfolios. Yet, amid these giants, one emerging contender— MAGACOIN FINANCE —is gaining recognition as the best crypto to buy before the next cycle begins. XRP Price Outlook: $3.20 in Sight XRP’s recent performance has drawn fresh institutional attention. On August 27, 2025, XRP climbed from $2.89 to $2.99, briefly touching $3.08 before consolidating. Analysts note: Support is firm at $2.89, repeatedly tested. Resistance sits at $3.06–$3.08, the key level to watch. A confirmed breakout above $3.08 could send XRP toward $3.20 and higher. Volume surged with 167.60 million XRP traded during the resistance test, more than double the 30-day average. Momentum indicators also show strength, with RSI rising from oversold conditions into the mid-50s. Institutional flows are a major catalyst. CME Group’s XRP futures reached $1 billion in open interest within just three months, the fastest growth of any new crypto futures contract on the exchange. This suggests XRP could become one of the best crypto to buy for institutions seeking near-term growth. Ethereum’s Steady Gains Backed by Institutions Ethereum also closed the day higher, trading at $4,631.10 with a market cap of $559.47 billion. Throughout August 27, ETH steadily gained ground, reaching $4,657.44 at one point. Despite a drop in trading volumes (down 22–30% compared to the prior period), Ethereum’s resilience highlights strong institutional accumulation and steady spot ETF inflows. Binance even reported ETH surpassing $4,600 USDT, a clear sign of sustained market confidence. Ethereum’s ability to hold above $4,600 amid lower volumes shows that big players remain committed. With its Layer 2 expansions and ongoing EIP upgrades, Ethereum continues to be viewed as one of the best crypto to buy for long-term portfolios. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Hidden Opportunity While XRP and Ethereum fight for dominance, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a fresh contender—drawing comparisons to Ethereum and XRP. Unlike established giants, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its presale phase, making it one of the best crypto to buy before mainstream attention sets in. Unlike many presales that only generate hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is proving its credibility. Backed by a Hashex audit and a fully transparent team, it’s quickly becoming one of the most trusted projects of 2025. Many investors now see it as a top crypto to buy before the next market surge. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s tokenomics have been purposefully constructed for prolonged scalability and sustainability, with the intent that the project will not only ride one rally but endure multiple bull cycles. Consequently, the long-term growth model has been likened by early backers to that of Shiba Inu, the latter’s meteoric rise of 8,900% noted, with particular emphasis on how presale allocation and community engagement could potentially unfold similar developments of substantial valuation in the upcoming cycle. For investors who missed out on Ethereum under $100 or XRP under $0.50, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the next breakout story—and one of the best crypto to buy in 2025. Final Thoughts: Best Crypto to Buy Before the Rotation XRP: Strong bullish setup with institutional futures growth. Ethereum: Consistent upward momentum and ETF-driven demand. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Compared to top assets, a presale diamond in the rough with one-of-a-kind upside before general use. XRP and Ethereum will most probably be the main focus of the news while institutions are getting ready for the next rotation. Retail investors, however, looking for a growth that can multiply exponentially, would consider MAGACOIN FINANCE as the top crypto to buy at the moment.

Understanding investor sentiment is crucial, and the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool for this. Recently, this key indicator has made a significant move, climbing nine points to 48. This shift signals a transition from a state of “Fear” to a more balanced “Neutral” sentiment among investors. But what does this evolving sentiment truly mean for your crypto journey? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index What exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , and why does it matter? This widely-followed index, developed by Alternative.me, serves as a barometer for market emotions. It distills complex market data into a single, easy-to-understand score. The index operates on a simple scale: 0: Represents Extreme Fear 100: Signifies Extreme Greed A score of 48, as we see now, places us squarely in the neutral zone. This indicates a period where neither extreme panic nor irrational exuberance dominates. How is This Crucial Market Sentiment Measured? The calculation of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is quite sophisticated, combining several key market factors. These elements provide a holistic view of investor behavior: Volatility (25%): Measures current price fluctuations and drawdowns. High volatility often indicates fear. Market Volume (25%): High trading volumes, especially during price drops, can signal panic selling. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment from various platforms, tracking keywords and hashtags. Surveys (15%): Gauges direct investor sentiment through polls (currently paused by Alternative.me, but a component). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increasing Bitcoin dominance often suggests a flight to safety, indicating fear. Google Trends (10%): Examines search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Increased search for “Bitcoin price manipulation” might signal fear, while “buy Bitcoin” could indicate greed. What Does a Neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index Imply? The shift to a neutral sentiment at 48 is more than just a number; it reflects a significant change in the market’s psychological landscape. When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index moves away from extremes, it often suggests: Reduced Panic: Investors are less likely to make rash decisions based on fear. Less FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): The market isn’t driven by irrational exuberance, which can lead to unsustainable pumps. Potential for Stability: A neutral phase can precede periods of more stable price action, allowing for clearer analysis. Opportunity for Reassessment: It provides a window for investors to re-evaluate their portfolios and strategies without extreme emotional pressure. This neutral stance encourages a more rational approach to investment decisions, moving away from the knee-jerk reactions seen during periods of extreme fear or greed. Navigating the Neutral Zone: Actionable Insights For crypto investors, a neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers unique opportunities and challenges. Here’s how you can approach it: Avoid Hasty Decisions: Resist the urge to chase small gains or panic sell on minor dips. Patience is key. Research Diligently: Focus on fundamental analysis of projects. Look for strong use cases, solid teams, and clear roadmaps. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Regularly investing a fixed amount, regardless of price, can be an effective strategy in less volatile periods. Manage Risk: Diversify your portfolio and only invest what you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Continue monitoring market news and technical indicators to anticipate future shifts in sentiment. A neutral market is often seen as a period of accumulation for long-term investors, as assets might be trading at fairer valuations compared to extreme market conditions. The recent shift of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to a neutral 48 is a compelling development for the cryptocurrency market. It signifies a calming of investor emotions, moving away from the volatile extremes of fear and greed. This balanced sentiment provides a crucial opportunity for thoughtful analysis and strategic decision-making. By understanding the factors that drive this index and adopting a disciplined approach, investors can better navigate the evolving crypto landscape. This period of neutrality might just be the calm before the next significant market move, offering a chance to position yourself wisely. Frequently Asked Questions About the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Here are some common questions about this important market indicator: Q: What does a “neutral” score on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index mean? A: A neutral score, typically between 40 and 60, indicates that investors are not dominated by extreme fear or extreme greed. It suggests a more balanced and rational market sentiment. Q: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A: The index is typically updated daily, providing a fresh snapshot of market sentiment for investors. Q: Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict market movements? A: While it’s a valuable indicator of sentiment, the index is not a crystal ball. It reflects current emotions, which can influence future price action, but it should be used in conjunction with other analytical tools, not as a sole predictor. Q: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index only relevant for Bitcoin? A: Although Bitcoin’s dominance and search volume are components, the index generally reflects overall cryptocurrency market sentiment. Bitcoin’s movements often influence the broader altcoin market. Q: Should I buy when the index is in “Extreme Fear” and sell in “Extreme Greed”? A: Many experienced investors consider “Extreme Fear” (low scores) as a potential buying opportunity (when others are fearful) and “Extreme Greed” (high scores) as a potential selling opportunity (when the market might be overheated). However, this is a general strategy and should always be combined with personal risk assessment and thorough research. Found this insight into the Crypto Fear & Greed Index helpful?

With Solana forecasts soaring, some investors are weighing whether new altcoins like MAGACOIN can deliver even greater upside. Solana’s DeFi ecosystem hits new highs Solana’s DeFi ecosystem has seen a dramatic surge in activity during 2025. Reports confirm its total value locked (TVL) jumped 30.4% in Q2 to $8.6 billion, reaching multi-year highs. By March, the figure climbed to $13 billion, highlighting a recovery that pushed Solana to the second-largest position in the DeFi sector. Alongside this TVL growth, Solana’s DEX volume reached $100 billion in March alone, eclipsing many rival networks. By April, that number hit $107 billion, doubling year-over-year. Solana teams also captured 57% of all dApp revenue, showing just how much of the activity was staying inside its ecosystem. For many traders, this backdrop has renewed confidence in Solana’s longer-term price trajectory. Institutional backing and technology upgrades Institutional interest is also reshaping Solana’s outlook. VanEck projects the token could hit $520 by year-end 2025, while JPMorgan recently raised its own target to $500. A major driver here is the growing likelihood of a Solana spot ETF approval, which analysts place at around 85%. At the same time, developments like Visa integration, along with Firedancer and Alpenglow upgrades, are expected to expand efficiency and attract new users. Analysts suggest these advancements could fuel adoption at a scale comparable to Ethereum’s earlier cycles. With this foundation, price forecasts from Finbold and others range from $520 to as high as $1,500, with some traders eyeing the round number target of $1,000. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Security, ROI, and missed opportunities While Solana gains headlines, traders are also noticing MAGACOIN FINANCE . The altcoin is currently trading under $0.0005 and has already established itself as a legitimate project through security audits and verified transparency. For early entrants, the math is simple: even a move toward $0.02 would represent around a 40x return. This type of upside draws parallels to stories of investors who missed early entries into Solana before it became a household name. But unlike meme coins with no structure, MAGACOIN emphasizes trust with its audited smart contract, community ownership, and KYC-verified team. For traders, it blends relatability with credibility, making it more than just another trend coin. The question many are asking is whether passing on MAGACOIN now could feel like missing Solana at $1 in hindsight. Conclusion: How to position in this market Solana’s 2025 forecasts suggest it could climb into four figures if institutional demand stays strong. At the same time, altcoins like MAGACOIN present early-stage entry points with audited security and clear upside math. For traders who want to balance established plays with new opportunities, this may be the time to act.

Recent market monitoring indicates that BTC has dipped below the critical $108,000 mark. Specifically, Bitcoin is currently trading at $107,989.04 on the Binance USDT market, signaling a moment of heightened attention for investors and enthusiasts alike. This sudden movement raises questions about market stability and what might be influencing this latest shift in Bitcoin’s valuation. What Triggered This Latest Bitcoin Price Drop? Understanding the forces behind any Bitcoin price drop is crucial for navigating the volatile crypto landscape. While a single definitive cause is often hard to pinpoint immediately, several factors typically contribute to such movements. These can range from broader macroeconomic trends to specific market events within the crypto ecosystem itself. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainties, such as inflation concerns, interest rate hikes, or geopolitical tensions, often lead investors to de-risk, pulling capital from speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased regulatory pressure or announcements from major governments can create FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt), impacting investor confidence and leading to sell-offs. Large Liquidations: Significant sell orders from whales (large holders) or cascading liquidations in futures markets can amplify downward price pressure. Technical Resistance: BTC might have hit a technical resistance level, prompting traders to take profits, which then triggers a larger sell-off. This recent dip highlights the dynamic nature of digital asset markets, where prices can fluctuate rapidly based on a confluence of internal and external factors. Investors are closely watching for further indications of market sentiment. How Does This Bitcoin Price Drop Impact Investors? For many, a Bitcoin price drop can evoke a mix of emotions, from concern to opportunity. Existing holders might see their portfolio value decrease, while new investors or those looking to average down might view it as a potential buying opportunity. It is important to approach such market movements with a clear strategy and an understanding of personal risk tolerance. Here’s how this market movement could be perceived: Short-Term Volatility: Traders might experience increased volatility, requiring quick decisions to manage positions. Long-Term Perspective: Many long-term holders, often referred to as ""HODLers,"" tend to view these dips as temporary corrections within a larger upward trend, focusing on Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition. Opportunity for Accumulation: Savvy investors often use such dips to accumulate more Bitcoin at a lower price, employing strategies like dollar-cost averaging. It’s always recommended to conduct thorough research and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making investment decisions, especially in a market as dynamic as cryptocurrency. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Price Drop: What’s Next? In the wake of this Bitcoin price drop , market participants are eager to understand potential future scenarios. Analyzing historical data and current market indicators can provide some clues, though past performance is not indicative of future results. Key areas to monitor include: Support Levels: Identifying strong support levels below $108,000 could indicate where the price might stabilize or rebound. Trading Volume: A significant increase in buying volume during a dip could signal renewed investor interest and a potential reversal. Market Sentiment: Social media trends and news cycles often reflect broader market sentiment, which can influence short-term price action. On-Chain Metrics: Data like exchange inflows/outflows, miner activity, and whale transactions can offer deeper insights into market dynamics. The cryptocurrency market remains a realm of constant evolution. While the immediate focus is on this particular dip, Bitcoin’s resilience and its foundational role in the digital economy continue to be central themes for its proponents. Observing how the market reacts in the coming days will be crucial for understanding the short-term trajectory of BTC. The recent Bitcoin price drop below $108,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency market. While such movements can be unsettling, they also underscore the importance of informed decision-making and a well-defined investment strategy. As the market continues to evolve, staying updated with reliable information and understanding the underlying drivers of price action will be key for all participants. Whether you are a seasoned trader or a new entrant, adapting to these market shifts is part of the journey in the exciting world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does a ""Bitcoin price drop"" mean for my investment? A1: A Bitcoin price drop means the value of your BTC holdings has decreased. For long-term investors, it might be a temporary fluctuation, while short-term traders might need to adjust their strategies. It can also present a buying opportunity for some. Q2: Is this recent Bitcoin price drop a sign of a bear market? A2: A single price drop, even a significant one, doesn’t automatically signal a bear market. It’s often a correction or reaction to specific market events. A bear market typically involves a sustained period of declining prices across the board. Q3: What should I do during a Bitcoin price drop? A3: Your actions should align with your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Some investors ""HODL"" (hold on for dear life), others might buy more (dollar-cost averaging), and some may sell to cut losses. Always avoid panic selling and consider professional financial advice. Q4: How quickly can Bitcoin recover from a price drop? A4: Bitcoin’s recovery time varies greatly. It can rebound within hours, days, or weeks, depending on the underlying causes of the drop, overall market sentiment, and new developments. The crypto market is known for its rapid reversals. Q5: Where can I find reliable information about Bitcoin price movements? A5: Reputable sources include established crypto news outlets, market monitoring platforms like Bitcoin World, financial news services, and official reports from regulatory bodies.

It’s expecting to hit $54 billion next quarter. But one major gap jumped out. The company didn’t make a single dollar from China through its H20 chip. The company is now in the same position Tesla was in before BYD ran it out of town. This is a classic Beijing move: welcome the outsider until the local player is ready, then freeze them out. According to CNBC, Nvidia is still trying to hold onto its China business. It’s not walking away. It’s doubling down with a new chip, the B30A, designed to dodge U.S. export controls. It’s reportedly more powerful than the H20 but still technically legal. It’s a chip built to survive the politics, not the market. And this comes while the company is already dealing with U.S. restrictions and accusations of backdoors in its products; none of which have stopped it from pushing its Blackwell Ultra platform for U.S. and allied data centers. But the obsession with China hasn’t ended. Beijing pressures buyers as Cambricon gains ground Inside China, regulators are now telling firms like Alibaba, ByteDance, and DeepSeek to explain why they’re still using Nvidia gear. Buying from a U.S. firm is now seen as a risk, because it’s political. Local companies don’t want to be caught investing in foreign tech while Xi Jinping pushes his plan for full domestic control of AI hardware and software. At the April Politburo study session, Xi said indigenization wasn’t optional, it was national policy. That’s opened the door for Cambricon Technologies, China’s answer to Nvidia. The company’s stock has exploded, up nearly 10x in two years. It turned a profit this year and is working on its Siyuan 690 processor, which analysts say could compete with the H100 and beat the restricted H20. What makes this more than just a business story is that Cambricon is already on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Entity List. Every chip it sells, every investor it gains, is treated inside China as proof that local tech can win without American help. Firms like DeepSeek have started building AI models for “home-grown chips soon to be released.” They’re not waiting for Cambricon to catch up to Nvidia. They’re moving on. That’s what happened with BYD and Tesla, Huawei and Apple, DeepSeek and ChatGPT. It’s the same script. Beijing uses foreign firms until their replacements are ready, then moves the market in a different direction. On Nvidia’s latest earnings call, the company confirmed what was already obvious: no H20 sales in China in Q2, and none expected in Q3. Executives blamed “geopolitical issues,” but didn’t go further, and they didn’t need to. U.S. policy adds fuel as Nvidia gets cornered Things weren’t helped when Howard Lutnick, the new U.S. Commerce Secretary under President Donald Trump, made headlines in July with a comment that set Chinese tech on fire. He said the U.S. strategy was to sell China “not the best stuff, not the second-best stuff, not even the third best… just enough to get [China] addicted.” That quote wasn’t ignored. Chinese security agencies and state-backed firms used it to argue that buying from Nvidia was dangerous and humiliating. It killed any quiet deals that might have gone under the radar. Now, local firms are under pressure to reject the H20 completely, which means Nvidia is getting squeezed from both ends. Washington tells it what it can’t sell. Beijing tells buyers what they shouldn’t buy. And in the middle is a chipmaker trying to serve two governments with totally different goals. Meanwhile, China is pushing forward with its AI Plus initiative. The plan is to build domestic AI into every sector of the economy by 2030. It includes big spending on local chips, high-bandwidth memory, and compute infrastructure. Cambricon is the poster child for that plan. If the Siyuan 690 gets close enough to Blackwell Ultra, it’s enough. Xi’s government doesn’t need the best, it needs “good enough” and 100% Chinese. Get seen where it counts.

This past Monday, for instance, we saw a notable gap of approximately $1,280 as futures opened at $109,545, significantly above Friday’s close of $108,265. Understanding this gap is absolutely crucial for anyone tracking Bitcoin’s market movements. What Exactly is a CME Bitcoin Futures Gap? A CME Bitcoin futures gap occurs when the opening price of CME Bitcoin futures on Monday differs from its closing price on the preceding Friday. On a chart, this appears as an empty space between the Friday close and the Monday open. This difference isn’t arbitrary; it reflects significant price action in the Bitcoin spot market while traditional futures exchanges are closed. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) adheres to traditional financial market hours, closing over weekends. However, the global Bitcoin spot market operates 24/7. So, if Bitcoin experiences a surge or dip between Friday evening and Monday morning, the CME futures market ‘catches up’ by opening at a price reflecting this weekend movement, thus creating the gap. Why Do These Gaps Appear, and What Do They Tell Us? The primary reason for a CME Bitcoin futures gap is the contrasting operating hours. This creates a unique dynamic, and the gap’s size often indicates Bitcoin’s weekend volatility. A larger gap suggests more significant price swings during the futures market’s non-trading hours. For traders and analysts, these gaps are often considered important market signals. Many believe these gaps tend to “fill” over time, meaning the futures price will eventually move back to cover the gap’s range. This theory forms a cornerstone for certain trading strategies. Weekend Volatility Indicator: A wide gap signals substantial weekend price action. Potential Price Magnets: Gaps are often seen as areas where the price might eventually return. Trader Sentiment: The gap’s direction reflects overall market sentiment entering the new week. Navigating the CME Bitcoin Futures Gap: Trader Strategies The concept of a CME Bitcoin futures gap filling is popular among traders. This doesn’t mean it always happens quickly or directly, but the idea is that market forces often pull the price back towards the ‘uncovered’ territory. For example, an upward gap might lead some traders to anticipate a future price dip to fill that void. However, “gap filling” isn’t a guaranteed event or precise timeline. While historical data shows a tendency, market conditions can change. Traders often combine gap analysis with other technical indicators and fundamental analysis for informed decisions. Here are some ways traders might approach these gaps: Gap Fade Strategy: Betting against the gap’s direction, anticipating a fill. Momentum Trading: Riding the initial momentum created by a substantial gap. Confirmation Bias: Using the gap as an additional data point to confirm existing biases. Understanding the Risks and Rewards of Gap Trading Trading around a CME Bitcoin futures gap comes with challenges. The crypto market is inherently volatile, and Bitcoin’s price is influenced by many factors beyond technical patterns. Unexpected news or macroeconomic events can easily override the tendency for a gap to fill. Key Considerations: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can move dramatically, making gap trading unpredictable. No Guarantees: Not all gaps fill, and some might take considerable time. Leverage Risks: Futures trading often involves leverage, amplifying both potential gains and losses. Investors must exercise caution, employ robust risk management, and never invest more than they can afford to lose. Thorough research and a clear understanding of market dynamics are paramount. The Bigger Picture: CME Bitcoin Futures Gap and Market Insights The existence and behavior of the CME Bitcoin futures gap offer a fascinating window into the evolving relationship between traditional finance and decentralized crypto. It highlights how institutional interest, via the CME, interacts with Bitcoin’s continuous, global trading. As the crypto market matures, understanding these unique interactions becomes increasingly important. These gaps serve as a regular reminder of Bitcoin’s distinct market structure and its susceptibility to weekend price action. Monitoring these opening gaps can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential short-term price movements, even if they don’t always lead to immediate “gap fills.” In conclusion, the CME Bitcoin futures gap is a distinctive feature of the Bitcoin market, stemming from the differing operational hours of traditional and crypto exchanges. While it offers intriguing possibilities for traders, it also underscores the importance of nuanced market understanding and prudent risk management. By staying informed about these gaps, you gain deeper insight into Bitcoin’s unique market behavior and can better navigate its often-volatile landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean for a CME Bitcoin futures gap to “fill”? A1: When a CME Bitcoin futures gap “fills,” it means the price of the futures contract eventually moves back to trade within the price range that was skipped over during the weekend closure. For example, if there was an upward gap, the price would dip back down to the Friday closing level. Q2: Do all CME Bitcoin futures gaps eventually fill? A2: While there’s a historical tendency for gaps to fill, it’s not a guarantee. Market conditions, new developments, and overall sentiment can influence whether and when a gap might fill. It’s a pattern, not a certainty. Q3: Why is the CME closed on weekends while Bitcoin trades 24/7? A3: The CME is a traditional financial exchange that operates on standard weekday business hours, similar to stock markets. Bitcoin, being a decentralized digital asset, trades globally and continuously across various exchanges, creating the discrepancy. Q4: How can traders use the CME Bitcoin futures gap in their strategy? A4: Some traders use the gap as an indicator for potential price reversals, betting that the price will move to fill the gap. Others might use it to gauge weekend volatility or as a confirmation for other technical analyses. However, it should always be combined with comprehensive risk management. Q5: Is trading the CME Bitcoin futures gap risky? A5: Yes, like all forms of cryptocurrency trading, it carries significant risk. Bitcoin’s high volatility means prices can move sharply, and “gap filling” is not guaranteed. Leverage in futures trading can amplify both gains and losses, making robust risk management essential.

These scheduled releases of previously restricted tokens can often lead to considerable price volatility and shifts in market sentiment. Understanding these unlocks is crucial for any investor looking to navigate the digital asset landscape effectively. What Are Crypto Token Unlocks and Why Do They Matter? Crypto Token Unlocks refer to the release of tokens from a vesting schedule or lock-up period. When a new blockchain project launches, a portion of its tokens are typically reserved for founders, early investors, and the development team. To prevent an immediate sell-off that could crash the price, these tokens are often locked up and released gradually over time. This process, known as vesting, aims to align the interests of core contributors with the long-term success of the project. However, when large amounts of tokens are unlocked, they can increase the circulating supply, potentially putting downward pressure on prices if recipients decide to sell. Conversely, if the market absorbs these tokens without significant selling, it can signal strong demand and project confidence. This week features several notable Crypto Token Unlocks that warrant close attention: September 1, 12:00 p.m. UTC: ZETA unlocks 47.94 million tokens ($8.87 million), representing 2.28% of its circulating supply. September 2, 12:00 a.m. UTC: SUI unlocks a substantial 44.25 million tokens ($144 million), which is 1.26% of its circulating supply. September 2, 12:00 a.m. UTC: BONK unlocks 504 billion tokens ($11.24 million), accounting for 0.57% of its circulating supply. September 2, 8:00 a.m. UTC: ENA unlocks 94.19 million tokens ($60.29 million), making up 1.42% of its circulating supply. September 5, 5:00 a.m. UTC: IMX unlocks 27.31 million tokens ($13.88 million), equivalent to 1.37% of its circulating supply. Deep Dive into This Week’s Major Crypto Token Unlocks The standout event among this week’s Crypto Token Unlocks is undoubtedly the SUI release. Valued at a staggering $144 million, this unlock could be a significant catalyst for price action. SUI, a layer-1 blockchain, has garnered considerable attention for its scalability and unique object-centric model. The market’s reaction to such a large unlock will be a key indicator of investor confidence in the project’s future. Similarly, the unlocks for BONK and ENA are also substantial in dollar terms, at over $11 million and $60 million respectively. BONK, a popular meme coin, often sees amplified price movements due to community sentiment. ENA, representing the Ethena Labs project, is a newer entrant with a focus on a synthetic dollar protocol. The release of these tokens will test their respective market’s ability to absorb the increased supply. ZETA and IMX also have notable unlocks. ZETA, part of the ZetaChain ecosystem, and IMX, a layer-2 scaling solution for NFTs on Ethereum, both play important roles in their specific niches. While their unlock values are smaller compared to SUI, they still represent a measurable percentage of their circulating supply, which can influence their short-term price dynamics. Therefore, closely monitoring these Crypto Token Unlocks is a wise strategy for traders and long-term holders alike. Navigating the Impact of Crypto Token Unlocks How should investors approach these upcoming Crypto Token Unlocks ? First, it is essential to understand that not all unlocks lead to a price dump. The impact depends on several factors, including the project’s fundamentals, overall market sentiment, the size of the unlock relative to the circulating supply, and the likelihood of recipients selling their tokens. For some projects, early investors or team members might be long-term holders with no immediate intention to sell. In other cases, the market might have already priced in the unlock, leading to a muted reaction. However, a significant unlock can create short-term selling pressure, especially if the broader market is already bearish. Actionable Insights for Investors: Research: Investigate the project’s fundamentals, recent developments, and community sentiment. Monitor Supply: Pay attention to the percentage of circulating supply being unlocked. A larger percentage often implies a higher potential impact. Observe Price Action: Watch how the token’s price reacts in the hours and days leading up to and immediately following the unlock. Risk Management: Consider adjusting your portfolio exposure or setting stop-loss orders if you are concerned about potential volatility. Beyond the Headlines: The Broader Picture of Crypto Token Unlocks While the immediate price implications of Crypto Token Unlocks are often the focus, these events also highlight important aspects of tokenomics and project transparency. A well-designed vesting schedule demonstrates a project’s commitment to long-term growth and decentralization. It ensures that core contributors remain incentivized to build and support the ecosystem over time. Furthermore, the ability of a market to absorb large token unlocks can be a testament to a project’s strength and investor confidence. Projects with strong communities, clear roadmaps, and innovative technology are generally better equipped to handle these supply increases without significant price depreciation. Therefore, these unlocks are not just isolated events but provide a window into the health and maturity of various blockchain ecosystems. In conclusion, this week’s lineup of Crypto Token Unlocks , particularly the substantial SUI release, offers a fascinating look into the dynamic nature of the crypto market. While they present potential challenges in terms of price volatility, they also provide opportunities for informed investors to make strategic decisions. By understanding the mechanics and implications of these unlocks, market participants can better prepare for and react to the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a Crypto Token Unlock? A1: A Crypto Token Unlock is when previously restricted or locked-up cryptocurrency tokens become available for trading. These tokens are often held by founders, early investors, or team members under a vesting schedule. Q2: Why do projects lock up tokens in the first place? A2: Token lock-ups are designed to prevent large-scale selling immediately after a project’s launch, which could destabilize the price. They also incentivize long-term commitment from core contributors. Q3: How do Crypto Token Unlocks typically affect prices? A3: Unlocks can increase the circulating supply, potentially leading to selling pressure and price drops. However, the actual impact depends on market demand, investor sentiment, and the percentage of the total supply being unlocked. Q4: Is the SUI unlock this week particularly significant? A4: Yes, the SUI unlock of $144 million is one of the largest this week, making it a crucial event to watch due to its potential to influence SUI’s price and broader market sentiment. Q5: What should investors do during periods of major Crypto Token Unlocks? A5: Investors should conduct thorough research, monitor market sentiment, observe the token’s price action, and practice sound risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders.

As we step into the first week of September, a series of **global macroeconomic events** are set to unfold, capable of sending ripples through both traditional markets and the volatile crypto space. Staying informed about these key dates and what they signify isn’t just smart; it’s essential for navigating potential market shifts. Why Early September’s Global Macroeconomic Events Matter For anyone invested in digital assets, it’s vital to recognize that crypto markets don’t exist in a vacuum. They are increasingly influenced by central bank policies, inflation data, employment figures, and geopolitical developments. These **macroeconomic events** often dictate investor sentiment, risk appetite, and the overall flow of capital, directly impacting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoin prices. This week offers a concentrated dose of economic data and commentary that could shape the narrative for the rest of the month. Being prepared means knowing what to watch and why. Monday’s Quiet Start & Tuesday’s Fed Focus The week begins with a quieter tone in the United States, but don’t let that lull you into a false sense of security. Here’s what’s on the immediate horizon: Sept. 1: U.S. markets are closed for Labor Day. While trading volume might be lower, it’s a good time for reflection before the week’s data deluge. Tuesday brings the Federal Reserve into sharp focus, with two significant releases that can influence market expectations: Sept. 3, 5:30 p.m. UTC: FOMC member Neel Kashkari speaks. Investors will be listening intently for any clues regarding the Fed’s stance on interest rates, inflation, or the overall economic outlook. His comments can move markets, especially if they signal a shift in policy. Sept. 3, 6:00 p.m. UTC: The Federal Reserve releases its Beige Book. This report offers anecdotal information on current economic conditions across the twelve Federal Reserve districts. It provides a qualitative assessment of the economy, complementing the quantitative data and often influencing the tone of upcoming FOMC meetings. Understanding these **global macroeconomic events** helps gauge the Fed’s next moves. Decoding Wednesday’s Economic Indicators Wednesday, September 4th, presents a critical look into the U.S. labor market and further insights from key Fed officials: Sept. 4, 12:30 p.m. UTC: U.S. Initial Jobless Claims are released. This weekly data point provides an early indicator of the health of the labor market. A higher-than-expected number could signal economic weakening, potentially leading to speculation about Fed rate cuts. Conversely, a lower number suggests resilience, possibly reinforcing a hawkish stance. Sept. 4, 4:05 p.m. UTC: FOMC member John Williams speaks. As President of the New York Fed, his insights are particularly impactful, given the NY Fed’s role in market operations. Sept. 4, 11:00 p.m. UTC: Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee speaks. His perspectives, often seen as more dovish, can offer a balanced view alongside other Fed speakers. Collectively, these speeches contribute to the complex picture painted by **global macroeconomic events**. The Week’s Main Event: Unpacking Friday’s Job Report Friday, September 5th, brings what is arguably the most anticipated **global macroeconomic event** of the week, with direct implications for interest rates and market sentiment: Sept. 5, 12:30 p.m. UTC: U.S. August Non-Farm Payrolls and Unemployment Rate are published. This is a blockbuster report for the markets. The Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) figure measures the number of new jobs created in the U.S. economy, excluding farm workers and some government employees. The Unemployment Rate, naturally, tracks the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. Why is this so important? Strong job growth and a low unemployment rate can signal a robust economy, potentially giving the Federal Reserve more reason to maintain higher interest rates. Conversely, weak job growth and rising unemployment might push the Fed towards rate cuts. Both scenarios can trigger significant volatility in bond yields, the U.S. dollar, and consequently, the crypto market. Navigating Market Volatility: What Crypto Investors Should Do Given the lineup of significant **economic events this week**, crypto investors should prepare for potential market volatility. While it’s impossible to predict exact market reactions, understanding the underlying drivers can help. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on economic news outlets and real-time data releases. Risk Management: Consider reviewing your portfolio’s risk exposure, especially around major data releases. Long-Term View: For long-term holders, short-term fluctuations driven by macro data might present buying opportunities. These **global macroeconomic events** are more than just numbers; they are indicators of the broader economic health that directly or indirectly affects every asset class, including your digital holdings. This first week of September promises to be a dynamic one for financial markets. From key Federal Reserve speeches to crucial labor market data, the insights gained will be instrumental in shaping investor sentiment and policy expectations. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, these **global macroeconomic events** are not merely background noise; they are critical signals that demand attention. Staying informed and understanding the potential ramifications of each release will empower you to make more strategic decisions in a rapidly evolving market landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are global macroeconomic events and why are they relevant to crypto? A1: Global macroeconomic events are large-scale economic occurrences or data releases, such as inflation reports, employment figures, or central bank policy decisions. They are highly relevant to crypto because they influence overall market sentiment, investor risk appetite, and the value of fiat currencies, which in turn impact the demand and pricing of cryptocurrencies. Q2: How does the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book impact markets? A2: The Beige Book provides a qualitative assessment of economic conditions across the U.S. regions. While not a direct policy statement, it offers insights into the Fed’s understanding of the economy, influencing market expectations for future monetary policy decisions, especially interest rate changes. Q3: Why are U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) considered so important? A3: NFP is a key indicator of U.S. job creation and economic health. Strong NFP figures often signal a robust economy, which might lead the Federal Reserve to maintain higher interest rates, potentially strengthening the dollar and impacting asset prices globally, including crypto. Q4: What should crypto investors do during a week with many significant economic events? A4: During such weeks, crypto investors should prioritize staying informed about upcoming releases, practicing sound risk management, and avoiding impulsive decisions based on short-term volatility. Understanding the potential impact of these **economic events this week** can help in making more strategic long-term choices.

The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic landscape, and understanding its cycles is crucial for any investor. One of the most talked-about metrics is the Altcoin Season Index , which currently stands at 54. This figure offers a fascinating glimpse into the ongoing battle between Bitcoin and the myriad of alternative cryptocurrencies. But what exactly does this number tell us, and how should investors interpret it? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: A Key Metric CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index provides a clear snapshot of market sentiment and performance. It’s not just a random number; it’s a carefully calculated metric designed to help you gauge the health of the altcoin market relative to Bitcoin. The index measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, with a few important exclusions. Top 100 Coins: It focuses on the most significant altcoins, giving a broad market perspective. Excluding Stablecoins and Wrapped Tokens: This ensures that the index reflects genuine market performance and not the pegging mechanisms of stablecoins or the derivative nature of wrapped tokens. Bitcoin Comparison: The core of the index lies in how these altcoins perform against Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. An official “altcoin season” is declared when 75% of these top coins manage to outperform Bitcoin within that 90-day window. A score closer to 100 indicates a robust and undeniable altcoin season, where alternative cryptocurrencies are generally seeing stronger gains than Bitcoin. What Does an Altcoin Season Index of 54 Imply? A current Altcoin Season Index of 54 suggests a balanced, yet somewhat uncertain, market environment. It’s a nuanced score that tells us a few things: Not a Full Altcoin Season: With a score of 54, we are clearly not in a full-blown altcoin season, which would require the index to be at 75 or higher. This means that while many altcoins are performing well, they haven’t collectively dominated Bitcoin’s performance. Not a Bitcoin Season Either: Conversely, it’s also not a definitive “Bitcoin season,” where Bitcoin significantly outperforms the majority of altcoins. A lower score, say below 25, would typically indicate a stronger Bitcoin dominance. A Transitional or Mixed Period: A score in the mid-50s often points to a transitional phase. Some altcoins are likely outperforming Bitcoin, while others might be lagging. It signifies a period where market leadership is not clearly defined, and investors need to be selective. This mixed signal means that while there are opportunities in altcoins, a broad, rising tide lifting all altcoin boats isn’t currently the dominant theme. Investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research rather than blindly investing across the board. Navigating the Current Crypto Climate: Actionable Insights With the Altcoin Season Index at 54, how should you adjust your strategy? This phase demands a more discerning approach than a full-blown altcoin bull run. Here are some actionable insights: Focus on Fundamentals: Instead of chasing hype, look for altcoins with strong use cases, active development, robust communities, and clear roadmaps. Projects with solid fundamentals are more likely to weather transitional periods. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: Keep an eye on Bitcoin’s dominance chart. A significant drop in Bitcoin dominance often precedes or accompanies an altcoin surge, even if the index isn’t at 75 yet. Diversify Wisely: While altcoins offer higher potential returns, they also come with increased risk. Diversify your portfolio across different sectors within crypto (DeFi, NFTs, Layer 1s, gaming) and maintain a balanced allocation to Bitcoin and stablecoins. Risk Management: Set clear entry and exit points. Volatility can be high during these mixed periods, so having a strategy to manage potential losses is vital. Remember, market cycles are a natural part of the crypto world. A score of 54 isn’t a signal to panic, but rather an invitation to refine your investment strategy and focus on quality assets. Challenges and Opportunities in a Mid-Range Altcoin Season Index Every market phase presents both challenges and opportunities. A mid-range Altcoin Season Index is no exception. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Without a clear market leader, individual altcoins can experience significant price swings. Difficulty in Selection: Identifying the outperformers becomes harder when the market isn’t broadly bullish on altcoins. Potential for False Breakouts: Some altcoins might show temporary pumps that don’t sustain, leading to potential losses for late investors. Opportunities: Undervalued Gems: During mixed periods, well-performing projects might still be overlooked, presenting opportunities for early investors. Sector-Specific Rallies: Instead of a general altcoin season, you might see specific sectors or narratives gaining traction, offering targeted investment opportunities. Accumulation Phase: For long-term investors, this can be an excellent time to accumulate strong altcoins at more favorable prices before a potential broader rally. The key is to remain informed and adaptable. The crypto market is always evolving, and understanding these indicators helps you stay ahead. Conclusion: Decoding the Altcoin Season Index for Smarter Investing The Altcoin Season Index at 54 offers a crucial piece of the puzzle for understanding current cryptocurrency market dynamics. It signals a period of selective growth rather than a widespread altcoin boom, demanding a thoughtful and research-driven approach from investors. By understanding how this index is calculated and what its current value implies, you can make more informed decisions, identify potential opportunities, and navigate the market with greater confidence. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or new to crypto, keeping an eye on this index is a powerful tool for strategic investing. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is an Altcoin Season? An Altcoin Season is a period when 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. It signifies a strong market trend where altcoins are generally seeing more significant gains than Bitcoin. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? The index is calculated by CoinMarketCap. It compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin’s performance over the preceding 90 days. A higher score indicates a stronger altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. Q3: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 54 mean for my investments? A score of 54 suggests a transitional or mixed market. It’s not a full altcoin season, nor is it a dominant Bitcoin season. This means that while some altcoins might be performing well, overall market leadership is not clearly defined, requiring selective investment and careful research. Q4: Should I invest heavily in altcoins when the index is at 54? A score of 54 advises caution. While there are opportunities, it’s not a signal for broad, aggressive altcoin investment. Focus on altcoins with strong fundamentals, conduct thorough research, and consider diversifying your portfolio to manage risk effectively. Q5: Where can I track the Altcoin Season Index? You can track the live Altcoin Season Index directly on CoinMarketCap’s website, which is the primary source for this metric. Did you find this analysis helpful?

PEPE has had an uneven streak and in the past few weeks has been losing ground yet has been of great interest to traders who thrive on volatility. Instead, Aave has recovered its dip and is strengthening around the major resistance points at which a number of traders are eyeing a breakout or another rejection. Both have strong arguments, yet another project is rapidly rising on investor lists. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being compared to early-stage breakouts, and projections suggest much larger returns than PEPE and Aave together. MAGACOIN FINance – Analysts Say 1000% ROI Potential is on the Table MAGACOIN FINANCE is establishing itself as one of the most promising altcoins entering 2025. Analysts are citing a potential 1000% ROI, which is much higher than the 60x80x PEPE and Aave will offer. Such an upside has been sufficient to make MAGA famous, yet security is what is closing trust. The project has cleared two audits by CertiK and HashEx – two of the most trusted blockchain security companies. Both affirmed that the smart contract is secure and transparent which is a huge success in a marketplace where scams still prevail. And above all, there is a 50% bonus being locked in early investors with code PATRIOT50X, and these are driving up the buying pressure with FOMO. With the hype, the trust, and the rewards piled up, MAGA has the potential to become the altcoin to beat in 2025. PEPE — Meme Power With a Recovery Setup PEPE has rebounded to $ 0.00001014 today after falling most of the month. The meme token remains 20% down in 30 days, yet it is also within an oversold territory. Its RSI has been stagnant at a low level over the weeks, and the MACD is negative, signaling that traders have overloaded the sell side. That is where recovery potential is introduced. A single large purchase would reverse the move and PEPE would be racing. Currently, it is trading at approximately $480 million, or 94% lower than in July. This is a sign of poor demand but also builds a spring board should the whales choose to re-enter in. Others have already dipped in but the wallets with big stacks have decreased. Analyst price targets are in the form of $0.000030 at the beginning of Q4 and perhaps 2026 at $0.00010. PEPE has remained a wild card that can turn someday when meme coin hunters have no expectation. AAVE — Strong DeFi Play, But Traders Stay Cautious Aave trades around $329.53 after bouncing back up last week, and is above the $325 breakout pivot. In the meantime, it is cementing below the resistance area of just below the $335-$340. Should the buyers manage to break above that range, AAVE has the room to challenge to $360-$375. If not, support sits back at $311–$314, or even the $300 floor if pressure increases. The RSI at 45 indicated that the momentum has slowed down, although this may allow the token room to recover. On-chain data, however, reveals net outflows up to August with the whales still profit-taking and traders remain cautious. The market cap stands at approximately $5.4B and the big holders are divided. On the fundamentals side, Aave is proceeding with its V3 integration into Aptos – its first non-EVM expansion. Its credit market has also expanded with partnerships with Kraken and traffic via Aavethena. Nevertheless, there is a sense of uncertainty caused by governance controversies and exposure issues associated with USDe. The AAVE may break higher in the short-term due to a rebound of inflows, but without greater conviction, this may trap it in a sideways band. Final Take All these tokens can grow, yet the arrangements are dissimilar. PEPE is meme power and quick flips, Aave is consistent DeFi with obstacles to overcome, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is promising huge upside potential and solid security support. Many traders see MAGACOIN FINANCE as the one to watch in 2025 with its 1000% ROI potentia l and dual audit confirmation of trust.

The currency has been stuck around 147 per dollar, but recent options activity shows traders are building positions to profit if it strengthens beyond 145. On August 26, the volume of dollar-yen puts was four times higher than calls, meaning leveraged investors expect Japan’s currency to break higher fast. Several events triggered this turn. First, President Donald Trump fired Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, pushing traders to expect more pressure on the Fed to cut rates. At the same time, France is dealing with a possible no-confidence vote, increasing demand for safer assets like the yen. Then there’s the upcoming U.S. payrolls report, which could show a slowdown and add more bets that the Fed will be forced to ease. Traders build massive downside dollar-yen structures Mukund Daga, who runs Asia FX options at Barclays in Singapore, said hedge funds have started buying downside dollar-yen positions in reaction to all the political headlines. “Post the flurry of news articles, including a potential no-confidence vote in France as well as the joust that Trump and Lisa Cook find themselves in, we’ve finally seen some interest picking up in owning USD/JPY downside optionality by a certain sector of the hedge-fund community,” he said. On the same day those headlines broke, the most active strike price on the put side was 144.93 for September expiries. The pair had closed at 147.05, and traders were clearly expecting it to drop. These puts become more valuable if the yen rises past the strike. It wasn’t just Barclays seeing this setup. Graham Smallshaw, a senior spot trader at Nomura Singapore, confirmed that since Jerome Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole, short-term downside bets have picked up. “The fast-money community has started to position once again with USD/JPY downside structures, particularly in the one- to two-month tenor in the form of digitals and outright puts,” Graham said. Those digital put options are a cleaner way to bet on a drop in the pair. They pay out a fixed amount if the dollar-yen falls under a certain level. Besides, more catalysts are coming this week. Japan’s labor cash earnings data is due Friday. If it shows wages rising, it could support the case for a Bank of Japan rate hike. Kazuo Ueda, the central bank’s governor, said at Jackson Hole on August 23 that the tight labor market in Japan continues to push wages up. That’s the kind of data that strengthens the yen fast. On the flip side, the U.S. jobs report is also due. If it’s weak, the dollar comes under pressure again and adds to the upward move in the yen. Japanese firms cut capex as tariffs drag on exports While traders are watching the options screen, Japanese businesses are feeling the heat. The Finance Ministry said capital spending on goods, excluding software, rose only 0.2% in the second quarter. That’s way down from the 1.3% gain reported in the preliminary GDP print. The revised GDP data, which drops on September 8, will reflect this slower investment pace. Over a longer time frame, things look a bit better. Year-on-year, investment including software grew 7.6%, beating the 6.1% median forecast. But short-term momentum is slowing. Company profits inched up just 0.2% and sales rose 0.8% from last year. This all ties back to tariffs. During Q2, the U.S. increased auto duties on Japan by another 25% and warned about slapping a 25% universal levy on a wide range of Japanese goods. In July, both countries agreed to cap auto and general tariffs at 15%, but the deal hasn’t been put in motion yet. Exporters are struggling. Japan posted its biggest export drop in over four years in July, marking the third straight month of decline. Companies are absorbing much of the tariff hit themselves, eating into profits just to hold on to customers. That’s making it harder to justify pay raises, even as the Bank of Japan wants higher wages to support inflation targets. A major part of the Japan-U.S. trade deal is a $550 billion investment mechanism that’s drawing fire at home. Critics are warning that Japanese firms could end up redirecting funds toward projects in the U.S., sidelining their local operations. That concern is growing as more companies prioritize U.S.-based expansion over domestic spending. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Specifically, a wallet address linked to LD Capital’s Trend Research made substantial transfers, sparking widespread discussion among investors and market watchers. This move involves millions of dollars in prominent altcoins, and understanding its implications is crucial for anyone tracking market trends. What Do These Crypto Deposits on Binance Signify? Yesterday, Onchain-Lenz reported a notable transaction: Trend Research deposited one million PENDLE tokens, valued at approximately $4.8 million, and 203,000 ENS tokens, worth about $4.73 million, directly to Binance. These significant crypto deposits Binance received total a staggering $9.5 million. Such large movements by institutional entities often signal potential shifts in market dynamics, making them key events to monitor. The immediate concern stemming from this action is the potential financial outcome for Trend Research. Analysts suggest that if the firm were to liquidate these assets at current prices, it could face an approximate loss of $2 million. This raises questions about the strategic intent behind such a move, especially given the considerable sum involved. PENDLE: A token associated with Pendle Finance, a protocol allowing users to trade tokenized future yield. ENS: The native token of the Ethereum Name Service, which provides decentralized naming for wallets, websites, and more. Understanding the Potential $2 Million Loss The prospect of a $2 million loss upon sale is certainly eye-catching. However, it is important to remember that a loss is only realized once the assets are actually sold. There are several reasons why an investment firm might make substantial crypto deposits Binance even if it means facing a theoretical loss. For instance, Trend Research might be rebalancing its portfolio, liquidating positions to free up capital for other investments, or preparing for a strategic shift. Sometimes, firms need to meet margin calls or simply adjust their exposure to specific assets. Furthermore, these deposits could be part of a larger, long-term strategy that is not immediately apparent to external observers. Therefore, while the potential loss is significant, it does not automatically imply a distressed sale. Key Considerations: Portfolio Rebalancing: Adjusting asset allocation. Liquidity Needs: Freeing up capital for other ventures. Strategic Moves: Preparing for new investment opportunities. Margin Calls: Fulfilling obligations on leveraged positions. Impact on PENDLE and ENS Markets Large crypto deposits Binance receives can often create ripples across the market, particularly for the specific tokens involved. When millions of dollars worth of PENDLE and ENS are moved to an exchange, it typically increases the available supply for trading. This influx can potentially lead to increased selling pressure, which might, in turn, affect the tokens’ prices. Market sentiment plays a crucial role here. News of a major firm depositing assets, especially with a potential loss attached, can sometimes trigger concern among other investors, leading to a bearish outlook. Conversely, if the market interprets the move as a precursor to new strategic plays, the impact could be mitigated or even lead to different outcomes. Monitoring the trading volume and price action of PENDLE and ENS in the coming days will be essential to gauge the true market reaction. Navigating Large Crypto Deposits: What Investors Should Know For individual investors, understanding the implications of significant crypto deposits Binance or other exchanges receive is vital. While these movements can create short-term volatility, they also offer opportunities for informed decision-making. It is always advisable to conduct thorough research and not react impulsively to single news events. Actionable Insights for Investors: Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on reports from analytics firms like Onchain-Lenz for early signals. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid overexposure to a single asset, reducing risk from sudden market shifts. Understand the Context: Always look beyond the headlines to understand potential motivations behind large transactions. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Protect your investments from sharp downturns if market sentiment turns negative. These large-scale institutional movements, often dubbed ‘whale activity,’ can indeed influence market psychology and price action. However, they are just one piece of the complex cryptocurrency puzzle. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto Deposits and Market Dynamics The Trend Research case highlights the growing institutional involvement in the crypto space and the increasing transparency provided by on-chain analytics. As more traditional financial players enter the market, we can expect to see more of these significant crypto deposits Binance and other exchanges, each carrying its own set of potential implications. The market’s ability to interpret and react to such data will continue to evolve. Ultimately, while the immediate focus is on the potential $2 million loss, the broader lesson lies in the continuous need for vigilance and informed analysis in the fast-paced world of digital assets. The crypto market remains dynamic, driven by both fundamental developments and the strategic maneuvers of its key participants. In summary, Trend Research’s substantial crypto deposits Binance involving PENDLE and ENS tokens have certainly captured attention. While the potential $2 million loss is a talking point, the underlying reasons could be complex, ranging from portfolio rebalancing to strategic shifts. Investors should remain observant of market reactions and use such events as a prompt for deeper analysis rather than immediate panic. The evolving landscape of institutional crypto movements continues to shape the future of digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are PENDLE and ENS tokens? PENDLE is the native token of Pendle Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to tokenize and trade future yield. ENS is the Ethereum Name Service token, which governs a decentralized naming system for Ethereum addresses, making them human-readable. Why would a firm deposit assets on an exchange if it means facing a potential loss? Firms may deposit assets at a theoretical loss for various strategic reasons, such as rebalancing their portfolio, freeing up capital for other investments, meeting margin calls, or preparing for a new market strategy. The loss is only realized if the assets are actually sold at that lower price. Who is Trend Research/LD Capital? Trend Research is an entity associated with LD Capital, a prominent venture capital firm known for its investments in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. They are significant players in the digital asset market. How do large crypto deposits on Binance impact market prices? Large crypto deposits on exchanges like Binance can increase the available supply of those tokens, potentially leading to increased selling pressure. This can sometimes cause a temporary price drop, depending on market demand and sentiment. However, the impact is not always immediate or solely negative. Is this a sign of a broader market downturn? While significant deposits can sometimes precede selling, one event alone is not definitive proof of a broader market downturn. It is crucial to consider the overall market sentiment, other on-chain data, macroeconomic factors, and fundamental project developments before drawing conclusions.

He made the remarks in a fiery Truth Social post following a major court ruling that struck down key elements of his trade policy. In a 7-4 decision, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that Trump had overstepped his authority by declaring a national emergency to impose tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of imports. The judges clarified that under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the president does not have the power to impose broad, general tariffs; this authority rests with Congress. The ruling represents one of the most significant legal setbacks to Trump’s economic agenda , which has heavily relied on tariffs since his return to the White House in January 2025. While these measures have generated record revenue, they have also put strain on the United States’ relationships with key trading partners. The existing tariffs will remain in place until October 14, giving the administration time to petition the Supreme Court. If the high court upholds the decision, the government could be forced to return billions of dollars already collected from importers. Trump appeals, defends tariffs as core to US strength Trump, who swiftly reacted to the court’s decision on X, said it amounted to a “radical left ruling” that, in his view, would not only destroy the US economy but also undermine the strength of the military. He warned that if the tariffs were struck down, the country would face years, and possibly decades, of rebuilding efforts. According to him, the ruling represented a dangerous setback that could strip the United States of one of its most effective tools for protecting national interests. He emphasized that he was fighting to preserve tariff protections, which he described as central to his economic vision. Trump maintained that tariffs had already saved key American industries, generated critical revenue for the government, and provided leverage against foreign governments. He argued that removing them would leave the US economically and strategically vulnerable, reinforcing his commitment to defending the policy in the courts. Trump to use tariffs to tackle debt Despite the legal setback , tariff collections have surged over the past two years. Treasury data shows revenue rose from $17.4 billion in April to $29.6 billion in July, with total collections for the fiscal year reaching $183.1 billion by late August. At this pace, the US is on track to match last year’s full tariff revenue in just five months. Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, said the administration might use some of the revenue to reduce the national debt, which totals nearly $37.2 trillion. He also hinted that tariffs could be a credit to American taxpayers. “I think at some point we’re going to be able to do it,” Bessent told CNBC in August. “We are absolutely laser-focused on paying down the debt.” Bessent also suggested that revenue estimates might be ratcheted to the upside from the current $300-billion estimate for the year, but he wouldn’t put out a new number. The decision comes as Washington remains sharply split over government spending, taxation, and debt reduction. Supporters of Trump’s tariffs view them as a rare means of raising money without raising domestic taxes. Critics say tariffs are an unseen tax on consumers and businesses that drives up the cost of everything from electronics to groceries. The Supreme Court’s decision could reshape US trade policy, economists say. Should the tariffs be invalidated, the government could lose a crucial revenue source, and importers could demand billions in refunds. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

This $0.035 May Have a Better Chance,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-shiba-inu-shib-flip-dogecoin-doge-this-0-035-may-have-a-better-chance/,"As the meme coin rivalry heats up once again, a new twist emerges in the ongoing battle between Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE). While the two coins of the meme token market continue to dominate headlines, a surprising coin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing growing investor attention. Mutuum Finance has a presale price of $0.035 in phase 6. Early investors will experience over 500% growth after listing. The Mutuum Finance presale has already reached over $15.25 million with over 15850 owners. Mutuum Finance could disrupt the market hierarchy and challenge dominance of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Hold Steady Amid Meme Coin Uncertainty Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently priced at $0.2205, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) trades at $0.00001254. Both tokens are showing limited movement as market sentiment remains cautious, with Dogecoin holding a tight range and Shiba Inu maintaining its key support level. While Shiba Inu is expected to skyrocket, its potential to flip Dogecoin (DOGE) remains low. Investors continue to watch these two meme coins closely as interest also grows in emerging decentralized finance projects such as Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Launches $50,000 Bug Bounty MUTM has announced its Bug Bounty Program launched in collaboration with Certik. Through an invitation to white hackers, developers, and security researchers to participate in the security program, Mutuum Finance will further enhance the security of its platform by rewarding them with bounties when they identify any vulnerability they are able to discover. The reward system will be up to 50,000 USDT and the award will also be proportional to the impact of the bug discovered whether small level bugs to high-impact bug vulnerability. The hierarchical model provides one of the widest security coverings and in the simplified form can safeguard the users, investors’ funds and profits, and gains increasing trust in the Mutuum Finance system. $100,000 Community Giveaway to Reward Supporters In addition to its bug bounty, Mutuum Finance team is also hosting a $100,000 giveaway that will be rewarding early project adopters and internally growing its user base. It will be rewarding 10 winners with $10,000 each. This will truly mirror the solid long term committed focus user base which the project is attempting to reach. These community programs are one of the goals of Mutuum Finance to not only be laboring towards creating a safe environment in the form of a platform that it is creating but also be a life-nurturing organization which assists in creating a feeding environment where the users, token holders and investors will be able to reap the success. Phase 6 Presale Achieves Major Milestones Mutuum Finance is already a rapidly growing behemoth in the DeFi market and has achieved that by onboarding over 15,850 investors as well as having recorded a presale of over $15.25 million. The project is currently at Stage 6 of Presale selling tokens at $0.035 per MUTM. The stage offers early birds a huge profit window where they are presented with a chance to buy in prior to the token breaking higher in subsequent stages. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in Stage 6 of its presale at $0.035, with over 15,850 holders and $15.25 million already secured. The project’s dual lending model, security-driven ecosystem, and early investor incentives position it as a serious coin to outpace not only meme tokens like SHIB and DOGE but also emerging DeFi competitors. As the next price lift approaches, the current stage offers one of the last accessible entries before momentum accelerates further.

While recent declines have unsettled some traders, broader data points to resilience within the network and a potential setup for a decisive breakout later in the month. Both technical and on-chain indicators are converging to suggest that XRP could be preparing for its next major move. Support levels hold as market steadies At the time of writing, XRP was changing hands around $2.8, a price level that has served as a key floor in recent sessions. The $2.77 zone has repeatedly acted as strong support, and analysts warn that losing it could open the door to $2.60 and even $2.40 in a more bearish scenario. On the upside, resistance remains clear at $3, with further hurdles at $3.20 and $3.30. Market analyst Austin Hilton, in a video shared on X, has highlighted $2.80, $2.50, and $2.00 as important levels to watch through September. Hilton argues that a dip to any of these zones should not be mistaken for weakness, but instead seen as buying opportunities for long-term investors. His view reflects a broader trend in which traders are choosing to accumulate rather than exit positions during market pullbacks.

This accumulation is notable because it has coincided with a sharp drop in derivatives open interest. Leverage-driven positions have cooled, yet XRP’s price has held steady near $2.8. This suggests genuine spot demand is underpinning current prices, creating conditions for a more sustainable upward push once momentum returns. Network growth adds to bullish case XRP’s blockchain activity is also strengthening. Transactions on the XRP Ledger have increased steadily in recent months, averaging around 90 per block each day. In addition, the number of new wallets has surged, with August seeing more than 7,000 new wallets created daily at peak. Even on quieter days, new wallet creation remained above 4,000. This steady growth in users and transactions highlights XRP’s use beyond speculation. Investors see this as evidence of functional adoption for payments and liquidity transfers, a factor that strengthens confidence during periods of price consolidation. The expanding base of active participants helps reinforce the asset’s resilience, even when short-term market sentiment appears fragile. Consolidation sets the stage XRP’s price movement since late August reflects a period of consolidation rather than a breakdown.

The cryptocurrency has managed to stay above key support levels, but conflicting signals from on-chain flows, leveraged trading, and technical charts are leaving traders split on its next move. At press time, Ethereum traded at $4,483, up nearly 3% on Sunday. Notably, despite recent turbulence, ETH remains 78% higher year-over-year, underscoring the strength of its broader recovery. Whales trim holdings as liquidity fears grow In the past two weeks, Ethereum whales offloaded more than 430,000 ETH, valued at roughly $1.8 billion. This selling pressure drove whale balances to their lowest in weeks and raised concerns about market resilience. Historically, such exits have often preceded price corrections as liquidity thins and selling pressure grows. At the same time, not all large players are heading for the exit. A separate report from LookonChain shows that a high-profile whale recently swapped 4,000 BTC, worth around $4.35 billion, for 96,859 ETH within 12 hours. That whale now holds 837,429 ETH valued at nearly $3.85 billion, underscoring the mixed stance among major holders, with some trimming positions and others making fresh, aggressive bets on Ethereum. ETH spot market shows signs of heating up While whale flows paint a divided picture, activity in Ethereum’s spot markets has surged. CryptoQuant’s Spot Volume Bubble Map shows that trading activity has entered a “heating phase,” with large transactions clustering across exchanges. Source: CryptoQuant Higher spot volume often signals rising volatility, as it reflects an intensified battle between buyers and sellers. Increased activity can improve liquidity, but it also sharpens short-term swings. The crucial question is whether the surge is driven by accumulation from retail and smaller investors, or whether it represents further distribution by whales seeking to offload into strength. Sell pressure Order flow data highlights a persistent sell-side dominance. In 90 days, aggressive sellers outweighed market buy demand, reinforcing bearish momentum from whale exits. Despite this, liquidation data showed that short sellers remain vulnerable. Over $28.59 million in short positions were liquidated recently, compared to $6.12 million in longs, as ETH steadied around $4,481. Source: Coinglass This imbalance illustrates how bearish traders have been repeatedly caught out during sharp moves, suggesting that even in a weak environment, sudden rebounds remain a real possibility. However, repeated liquidations on both sides underline how sensitive the market has become to price swings. The key Ethereum price levels to watch Ethereum’s price is currently holding above $4,200 support while consolidating toward resistance at $4,800. Analysts highlight the $4,287 “Powell Candle” as a critical support line that has repeatedly absorbed selling pressure. A loss of this level could expose Ethereum to declines toward $3,975. On the flip side, a break above $4,800 would signal bullish continuation and open a path toward $5,200–$5,500. Hidden bullish divergence on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) adds weight to this view, suggesting that momentum may favour a rebound if buyers defend key levels.

50994139,https://invezz.com/?p=2856766,1756690681,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Eric Trump reiterates $1 million Bitcoin prediction as range tightens,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/01/eric-trump-reiterates-1-million-bitcoin-prediction-as-range-tightens/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has endured a difficult summer, lagging behind Ethereum’s rally and trading in a narrow range as August closed. But despite the short-term setbacks, optimism in some corners of the market is as strong as ever. Eric Trump, co-founder of “American Bitcoin,” has doubled down on his bold forecast that BTC will eventually reach $1 million, pointing to surging institutional demand and the conviction of long-term holders. Trump doubles down on $1M target Speaking at the Bitcoin Asia 2025 conference in Hong Kong , Trump repeated his call that Bitcoin is destined for $1 million “without question.” He argued that nation-states, Fortune 500 companies, and wealthy families are all aggressively buying Bitcoin, creating a structural squeeze that will support higher prices in the years ahead. “Everybody wants Bitcoin. Everybody is buying Bitcoin,” Trump said, highlighting what he views as accelerating adoption across the global economy. Despite the price already trading well above $100,000, he insisted that investors are still early, since broader retail participation remains limited compared to institutional activity. Trump’s comments come as long-term holders are providing a strong base for the market. On-chain data shows the 6–12-month UTXO band holding above 20% dominance, levels last seen during the 2021 peak. This suggests many investors who bought near previous highs are still holding tight, creating a psychological floor for the market. Market drags into September Even with Trump’s bullish narrative, Bitcoin has been under pressure in recent weeks. Bitcoin lost 7% in August while Ethereum surged 17%, widening the performance gap between the two largest cryptocurrencies. Over the last two months, Bitcoin’s price has barely moved, while Ethereum has soared more than 70%. At press time, Bitcoin traded around $108,800 after failing to hold above $110,000. Technical indicators show weakness, with the daily RSI near 38 and the MACD still in negative territory. Unless buyers step in, Bitcoin could drift toward deeper support zones. Interestingly, historically, September has not been kind to Bitcoin, with average declines of around 3.7% since 2013. However, October has nearly always provided a rebound. The crypto community even calls it “Uptober,” with average gains of 21% recorded across past years, and analysts suggest a similar pattern could play out again in 2025, especially if Federal Reserve policy shifts toward rate cuts later this month. Derivatives markets bullish While spot prices remain in a tight range, activity in derivatives markets is surging. Futures open interest across major venues sits in the mid-$80 billion range, near yearly highs, with CME Group and Binance leading the pack. Options markets are also brimming with activity, with open interest above $50 billion and a notable skew toward calls. Traders are especially focused on higher strike prices, with heavy positioning in the $140,000 to $200,000 range for Q4 expiries. That suggests investors are hedging against downside risks while leaving room to benefit from a major upside move later in the year. Near-term, however, max pain levels sit close to $110,000, reflecting expectations for consolidation before any significant breakout.

Second-quarter net income tumbled nearly 30% to ¥6.36 billion ($892 million), coming in well below analyst forecasts. The Shenzhen-based automaker has been expanding rapidly at home and overseas since 2021, but slowing margins have started to weigh on earnings . While revenue climbed 14% year-over-year to ¥201 billion, the gains weren’t enough to offset the pressure from price cuts. Gross margin slipped to about 18%, down from 18.8% a year earlier, underscoring how discounting is eroding profitability. BYD battles at home with price wars while accelerating global expansion China remains the world’s largest electric vehicle market, but the competition has grown cutthroat. Giants like BYD, Tesla, Geely, Nio, and Xpeng are locked in a price war , alongside dozens of smaller brands. To stay competitive, BYD slashed prices on more than 20 models this year, with discounts reaching up to 34%. The strategy boosted sales volumes but squeezed profits, while excess inventory across the industry pushed automakers to cut prices even further. The relentless race to the bottom has already forced some smaller EV startups out of business. Regulators have started to intervene. In July, Chinese authorities urged automakers to end what they called “involution”, a destructive cycle where everyone loses. Officials warned that unchecked price wars risk damaging the supply chain and undermining the global reputation of Chinese-made EVs. Even BYD, which had a hand in starting the price war in 2023, now acknowledges that it isn’t a viable long-term business model. Executives said in June that the current discounting melee was not sustainable and threatened lasting harm to the industry. BYD’s foreign operations are booming even as profits slump at home. In the first seven months of 2025, international sales more than doubled. The company has made big inroads in Europe, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. In Europe in May, BYD took Tesla’s monthly sales. It is also constructing factories in Hungary and Turkey, and has chartered a fleet of roll-on/roll-off ships to accelerate exports. Brazil has emerged as one of its largest international markets, representing about a third of international sales. And yet, despite this momentum, foreign growth hasn’t been enough to fully compensate for soft margins in China. Analysts say higher marketing expenses and more new technology purchases are dragging down profits. Growth stalls as financial pains worsen BYD is also confronting expanding financial burdens. And its working capital deficiency increased from ¥95.8 billion as of March to ¥122.7 billion as of June 30. Its ratio of debt to assets rose to 71.1%. At the same time, the company has had to rethink how it manages payments to suppliers while continuing to offer steep discounts on inventory. Previously, BYD often delayed payments for more than 200 days, far longer than global industry norms. New government rules now require suppliers to be paid within 60 days. Although this shift helps protect smaller suppliers, it reduces BYD’s financial flexibility and piles additional pressure on its balance sheet. Spending on research and development is increasing, too; it’s up over 50% from a year ago. BYD is relying on a heavy investment in batteries, electrification, and smart-car technologies to protect its long-term lead. Higher-margin brands like Yangwang and Fangchengbao might offer better margins, but building them out will take time. Analysts have trimmed expectations. BYD had targeted to sell 5.5 million vehicles in 2025, but estimates now project 5 – 5.2 million. The company remains the dominant force in China’s EV business and a global front-runner in the same segment. Analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein described the shrinking margins as “scars of competition.” However, the firm still holds an outperform rating on the stock and touted BYD’s global scale and technological edge.

Solana has bounced back from recent volatility, with sharp price movements keeping traders on edge. At the same time, Chainlink is gaining attention with bullish predictions fueled by whale accumulation and new partnerships that continue to strengthen its network. While these coins dominate headlines, another story is unfolding away from the charts. BlockDAG’s (BDAG) presale has already raised more than $388 million, making it one of the strongest early-stage performers in 2025. The X1 miner app now boasts over 3 million active users, showing adoption at a scale few presale projects can match. Each miner adds to demand, security, and scarcity, creating a cycle that positions BlockDAG as a rare opportunity ahead of its exchange debut. Solana Shows Renewed Strength After Sharp Rebound Solana has demonstrated resilience after a turbulent few days. The price fell to $176.27 on August 19 but quickly rebounded to $187.95 the following day, now holding steady around $184 to $185. Traders are watching the $188 to $195 zone as the next resistance, with the potential of $200 to $220 if momentum continues. Behind the price action, strong whale activity and profit-taking have shaped the market. A new wallet recently withdrew 60,000 SOL worth more than $11 million from Binance, while long-term holders realized $105 million in profits before the bounce. Institutional inflows, including a $1.15 billion IPO settlement, have supported the rebound, with analysts eyeing $192 to $195 as the next target. LINK Builds Momentum With Adoption and Accumulation Chainlink has been gathering momentum with LINK trading around $25 to $26 after recovering from a brief pullback. The token climbed above key Fibonacci levels on August 20, with analysts setting their sights on $30.55 as the next near-term goal. More than 9,600 new wallets were created in a single day, the highest in 2025, reflecting rising demand and user activity. Institutional and whale confidence is reinforcing this trend. Large holders have accumulated over 1.29 million LINK worth about $31 million in four days, while trading volume rose 7.7% and open interest gained 15%. Chainlink’s partnership with Intercontinental Exchange has also expanded adoption by bringing forex and metals data on-chain, with analysts suggesting a possible run toward $38 to $40 if $30 resistance levels are cleared. BlockDAG’s X1 App Drives Mass Adoption: 3M Users Hit BlockDAG’s presale has become one of the most talked-about stories in crypto, and a major reason is the explosive adoption of its X1 mobile mining app. The platform has already attracted more than 3 million active users who mine BDAG coins daily. This is not just casual interest; it represents a committed community that mines, holds, and steadily reduces supply while fueling constant conversations around the project. The result is a powerful cycle of growth and scarcity that strengthens BlockDAG’s positioning in the market. At the same time, the presale itself has exceeded expectations, raising over $388 million while selling more than 25.6 billion BDAG coins across 30 batches. Each new batch brings a higher price, which has created real urgency for buyers entering late. Early participants from batch one are already seeing paper returns of 2,900%, a signal of the kind of upside potential if BlockDAG lists as strongly as anticipated. Behind this surge is BlockDAG’s technology. Its hybrid architecture combines DAG scalability with Proof-of-Work security, achieving speeds of up to 15,000 transactions per second. Full EVM compatibility ensures developers can build Ethereum-based applications seamlessly, while 19,000 ASIC miners have already been shipped. Looking ahead, confirmed listings on MEXC, LBank, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart, alongside talks with Coinbase and Gemini, provide further momentum. With millions of grassroots miners, a growing developer ecosystem, and a presale hard cap of $600 million, BlockDAG has built a compelling case as one of the best crypto options for sustained returns in the years to come. Points to Remember Solana’s rebound into the mid $180s highlights how its price action continues to attract traders, supported by strong whale moves and institutional inflows. Chainlink is also pushing higher with bullish momentum, as whale accumulation, network growth, and its ICE partnership drive confidence toward $30 and beyond. Both remain important players in the broader market and continue to show resilience. BlockDAG, however, is carving its own path with adoption numbers that stand out. With more miners actively holding, supply tightens, and long-term upside becomes clearer. Supported by a powerful presale, upcoming exchange listings, and a growing community, BlockDAG is being recognized as one of the best crypto opportunities for higher returns in 2025.

Both r/CryptoCurrency and other forums are speculation the next popular altcoin to invest in. Currently, the three names dominating discussions are Solana, Bonk, and MAGACOIN FINANCE . The trifecta of adoption, culture and early-stage opportunity is captured through the pursuit of retail investor markets together. Solana’s expanding ecosystem Solana has maintained its popularity throughout 2025 thanks to its low fees, high throughput and strong developer ecosystem. Everything from launching tokens to NFT platforms is powered by the chain, which has become one of the most active Layer-1 networks around. According to Reddit users, Solana is considered the “workhorse” among all altcoins, as it is not as flashy as memecoins, but a reliable base with long-term growth. According to analysts, the rising institutional adoption and consistent inflows into Solana-based projects suggest that its momentum may not fade this year. BONK’s cultural influence While Solana focuses on infrastructure, BONK is geared towards meme speculation. BONK is a memecoin linked to Solana’s network, and has seen impressive staying power following its hype cycle. It has one of the most liquid memecoins so far. The ongoing demand for the token backed by its passionate community and presence on decentralized exchanges, makes it one of the most traded tokens. Discussions on Reddit reveal that BONK is resilient. Many users consider it a cultural asset, not just a financial one. Although BONK may be volatile, its ability to capture attention makes it a consistent presence in conversations about which coins may lead the next altcoin season. A rising early-stage opportunity MAGACOIN FINANCE is the third popular coin on Reddit. MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in early access while Solana and BONK already have a huge user base. Community discussions refer to it as a rare opportunity to capture the upside before further listings, and jade is one of the few early-stage opportunities left in the market. With investor demand on the rise, Redditors view MAGACOIN FINANCE as a cultural-financial narrative that combines meme energy with development milestones. The company’s momentum ahead of next market rotation is clearly apparent in its ability to create buzz with bigger-cap names. Bottom line Reddit has historically given timely direction of the retail flows in crypto space. In 2017, Ethereum gained traction in these forums. In 2021, Solana and SHIB became breakout names. In early 2025, focus shifts to Solana’s ecosystem, BONK’s cultural value, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early-stage potential. They reflect the three forces that adopt this cycle: community and asymmetry. Traders interested in market sentiment should keep an eye on these coins, as they could do the talking and lead to the next cycle of Altcoin gains.

There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $108,450 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might start another decline if it breaks the $108,000 support zone. Bitcoin Price Dips Again Bitcoin price attempted a fresh recovery wave from the $107,352 low. BTC was able to climb above the $108,000 and $108,500 resistance levels. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $113,457 swing high to the $107,352 low.

Recently, the crypto community has been abuzz with news of a significant transaction by one such influential entity, hinting at a potentially massive shift in strategy. What’s Driving This Bitcoin OG’s Strategic Maneuver? Just moments ago, a prominent Bitcoin OG made headlines by depositing a staggering 1,000 BTC, valued at approximately $108.1 million, into Hyperliquid, a leading decentralized exchange. This substantial move isn’t an isolated incident; it follows a similar, even larger transaction from the same address just the day before. Recent Deposit: 1,000 BTC ($108.1 million) transferred to Hyperliquid. Timing: Occurred very recently, signaling immediate intent. Likely Intent: Market observers widely believe this deposit is earmarked for acquiring Ethereum (ETH). Preceding Action: The same address previously swapped 4,000 BTC ($435.3 million) for 96,859 ETH. This pattern of activity strongly suggests a calculated pivot, where a significant portion of Bitcoin holdings is being converted into Ethereum. The scale of these transactions by a single Bitcoin OG is remarkable and certainly warrants closer examination. Why Hyperliquid? Unpacking the DeFi Choice The choice of Hyperliquid, a decentralized exchange (DEX), for such a colossal transaction by a Bitcoin OG is particularly telling. Unlike centralized exchanges, DEXs offer greater autonomy and often appeal to those prioritizing privacy and control over their assets. But what makes Hyperliquid the platform of choice for a move of this magnitude? Decentralization: Transactions occur directly between users, reducing reliance on intermediaries. Security & Control: Users retain custody of their funds, minimizing counterparty risk. Liquidity: Hyperliquid, like other growing DEXs, offers sufficient liquidity for large trades, especially for major pairs like BTC/ETH. Efficiency: Often provides competitive trading fees and rapid execution for sophisticated traders. The decision to leverage a DEX underscores a sophisticated understanding of the crypto landscape, aligning with the principles often held by early adopters. It’s a clear statement about where this particular Bitcoin OG sees value and operational efficiency. The Broader Market Implications of a Bitcoin OG’s Shift When a long-standing Bitcoin OG makes such a significant reallocation of capital, it inevitably sparks conversations across the crypto market. Is this a signal of a broader trend? What does it mean for the future dynamics between Bitcoin and Ethereum? Shifting Sentiments: Large-scale moves by whales can influence market sentiment, potentially encouraging others to re-evaluate their portfolios. Ethereum’s Appeal: The sustained purchasing of ETH suggests a strong belief in Ethereum’s ecosystem, its future scalability, and its role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT spaces. “Flippening” Narrative: While highly speculative, such moves can reignite discussions about the ‘flippening’ – the hypothetical event where Ethereum’s market capitalization surpasses Bitcoin’s. Supply Dynamics: A large buy order for ETH on a DEX could temporarily impact its price and liquidity. These transactions serve as a potent reminder that even established assets like Bitcoin are subject to continuous re-evaluation by experienced market participants. The strategic actions of this Bitcoin OG could be a bellwether for evolving investment strategies in the crypto space. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for Investors While the actions of a single Bitcoin OG are significant, individual investors should approach such news with a balanced perspective. Understanding the motivations behind these large-scale movements can provide valuable context, but it’s crucial to form independent investment decisions. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always investigate market trends, project fundamentals, and technological advancements yourself. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all your eggs in one basket, even if a whale is doing it. Risk Management: Understand the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies and invest only what you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain data and expert analysis, but filter for credible sources. The crypto market is dynamic and complex. While following the lead of a savvy Bitcoin OG might seem appealing, a well-thought-out personal strategy remains paramount for sustainable success. The recent actions of this influential Bitcoin OG – depositing over $108 million in BTC to Hyperliquid with the clear intent to acquire ETH – underscore the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investments. It highlights a strategic pivot that could reflect deeper shifts in market sentiment towards Ethereum’s burgeoning ecosystem. As the crypto world watches closely, these movements remind us of the immense capital at play and the continuous re-evaluation of digital asset values by seasoned participants. Whether this signals a broader trend or an isolated, yet impactful, decision, it certainly adds another compelling chapter to the ongoing narrative of digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Bitcoin OG? A: A Bitcoin OG (Original Gangster) refers to an early adopter and long-term holder of Bitcoin, often someone who acquired BTC in its nascent stages and has held onto it for many years, accumulating significant wealth. Q2: What is Hyperliquid? A: Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other without the need for a central intermediary. It’s known for its high-performance and user-controlled asset management. Q3: Why would a Bitcoin OG convert BTC to ETH? A: The reasons can vary, but often involve a belief in Ethereum’s potential for greater growth due to its robust ecosystem (DeFi, NFTs, dApps), its upcoming technological advancements (like scaling solutions), or a strategic diversification play. Q4: Do these large transactions impact market prices? A: Yes, large transactions by whales can certainly influence market prices, especially for assets with lower liquidity. Significant buy or sell orders can create temporary price movements and affect overall market sentiment. Q5: Is this a sign that Ethereum will “flip” Bitcoin? A: While such large-scale conversions can fuel the “flippening” narrative (where ETH’s market cap surpasses BTC’s), it’s important to remember that this is a highly speculative long-term outlook. One transaction, even a large one, does not definitively predict such an event. Did this fascinating insight into a Bitcoin OG ‘s strategic moves pique your interest?

This isn’t just any transaction; it involves billions of tokens from a DeFi project with notable connections. On-chain analysts are scrutinizing the details, attempting to piece together the narrative behind this significant movement of digital assets. What Sparked This Massive WLFI Token Transfer? Approximately two hours ago, a multisig address associated with WorldLibertyFinancial (WLFI) executed an enormous WLFI token transfer . WorldLibertyFinancial is a DeFi project that has garnered attention due to its reported links to the Trump family. The initial transfer saw 17.63 billion WLFI tokens moved to an address beginning with 0xFef. Shortly after this initial movement, a substantial portion of those tokens—specifically five billion WLFI—was returned to the originating multisig address. This partial return adds an intriguing layer of complexity to an already mysterious event, leaving observers to ponder the precise intentions behind the two-way flow of assets. Why Is This WLFI Token Transfer So Significant? This particular WLFI token transfer stands out for several reasons. It represents the largest transaction originating from this specific multisig address in the past eleven months. Such a large-scale movement typically signals major developments or strategic decisions within a project, yet the purpose here remains officially undisclosed. Multisig addresses, or multi-signature addresses, are cryptocurrency wallets that require multiple private keys to authorize a transaction. They are often used by organizations or projects like WLFI to enhance security and distribute control, preventing a single point of failure. The use of such an address for this massive transfer underscores the importance and planned nature of the action, even if its ultimate goal is currently unclear.

Could it be part of a liquidity management strategy, or perhaps a reallocation of funds for development? Without an official statement, the community is left to analyze the on-chain data and speculate on the implications of this significant event. What’s Next for WLFI After This Token Transfer? Adding to the intrigue, WLFI is slated for major exchange listings on September 1st. These listings are scheduled across prominent platforms including Binance, Kraken, HTX, and KuCoin. This impending market exposure amplifies the impact of the recent WLFI token transfer , as market participants attempt to gauge how this activity might influence the token’s debut performance. For investors and enthusiasts, monitoring WLFI’s trajectory in the coming days will be crucial. The confluence of a massive, unexplained token movement and imminent exchange listings creates a volatile yet potentially exciting environment. Transparency from the WLFI project team regarding the purpose of this transfer would undoubtedly help to stabilize sentiment and provide clarity to the market. In conclusion, the recent WLFI token transfer of 17.63 billion tokens has injected a significant dose of mystery into the DeFi space. While the immediate purpose remains elusive, the sheer scale of the transaction, coupled with WLFI’s upcoming listings on major exchanges, ensures that all eyes will be on this project. The crypto community eagerly awaits further developments and official explanations that could shed light on this intriguing on-chain event.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a significant development that could impact Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory. Recent reports suggest that a major Bitcoin whale sell-off is underway, potentially paving the way for a price correction. Analysts are closely watching these movements, with some predicting that Bitcoin could retest the $105,000 mark. What’s Driving This Bitcoin Whale Sell-Off? According to a Cointelegraph report, a long-term Bitcoin holder, identified by analyst Ted, has been actively divesting a substantial portion of their holdings. This particular whale sold a staggering 32,000 BTC over the past two weeks. Such a large-scale liquidation from a single entity naturally sends ripples through the market, influencing sentiment and supply dynamics. This isn’t just a simple sell-off; it’s a strategic move. The funds from this significant Bitcoin whale sell-off were immediately reinvested. The whale reportedly purchased 870,000 ETH, valued at an impressive $3.8 billion. This substantial shift from Bitcoin to Ethereum highlights a potential strategic reallocation of capital by a major player in the crypto space. Is the Whale Eyeing More Ethereum? The analyst further noted that this particular whale still holds over 50,000 BTC. There is a high probability that this remaining amount could also be converted into ETH. This potential continued shift could amplify the effects of the initial Bitcoin whale sell-off , creating further downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price while potentially bolstering Ethereum’s position. Such large-scale movements by whales often precede significant market adjustments. While individual investors cannot match the scale of these transactions, understanding these patterns offers crucial insights into potential market trends. The market is currently dominated by sellers, a sentiment echoed by Cointelegraph’s analysis. How Do Spot Bitcoin ETFs Impact the Market During a Sell-Off? Spot Bitcoin ETFs have become a significant factor in market dynamics, often acting as a major source of demand. However, the market recently experienced a temporary headwind. With the U.S. stock market closed on a particular day, there was a noticeable lack of inflows into these crucial investment vehicles. This pause in institutional buying can, at times, exacerbate the impact of a significant Bitcoin whale sell-off , as there is less counter-balancing demand. When large sellers are active and institutional buying is on hold, the market can feel the pressure more acutely. This scenario underscores the interconnectedness of traditional finance and the crypto market. Therefore, monitoring both on-chain whale activity and traditional market indicators becomes essential for a comprehensive understanding of Bitcoin’s immediate future. Responding to the Bitcoin Whale Sell-Off: What Should Investors Consider? Given the current market conditions and the ongoing Bitcoin whale sell-off , investors might wonder about the best course of action. It is important to remember that price corrections are a natural part of any volatile market. Here are some considerations: Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on whale movements and large transactions, as they often provide early indicators of market shifts. Understand Market Cycles: Bitcoin has a history of volatility, with periods of significant gains followed by corrections. This current situation might be part of a larger cycle. Diversification: Consider a diversified portfolio to mitigate risks associated with single asset volatility. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and have a clear exit strategy. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Differentiate between short-term price fluctuations and Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a store of value and digital asset. While a retest of $105,000 might seem daunting, it could also present opportunities for those with a long-term perspective. The resilience of Bitcoin has been proven time and again. Conclusion: Navigating the Waves of Whale Activity The intensifying Bitcoin whale sell-off , coupled with a strategic shift towards Ethereum, presents a compelling narrative for the crypto market. Analyst predictions of a potential $105,000 retest highlight the importance of staying informed and understanding the various forces at play. While market headwinds from a lack of ETF inflows can add pressure, the crypto ecosystem remains dynamic and full of potential. Investors are encouraged to conduct their own research and make informed decisions, keeping a close watch on both whale movements and broader market sentiment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a ‘Bitcoin whale’? A ‘Bitcoin whale’ refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Bitcoin, typically enough to significantly influence market prices with their trades. Why would a whale sell Bitcoin to buy Ethereum? Whales might sell Bitcoin to buy Ethereum for various strategic reasons, including diversification, a stronger belief in Ethereum’s future growth or utility, hedging against potential Bitcoin downturns, or optimizing their portfolio for different market cycles. How do spot Bitcoin ETFs affect the market? Spot Bitcoin ETFs provide an accessible way for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. Inflows into these ETFs typically increase demand for Bitcoin, potentially driving up its price. Conversely, a lack of inflows can remove a key source of buying pressure. Is a $105,000 Bitcoin price correction definite? No, market predictions are never definite. Analyst Ted’s prediction of a $105,000 retest is based on current whale activity and market conditions. However, the crypto market is highly volatile and influenced by numerous factors, so actual price movements can vary. What should investors do during a Bitcoin whale sell-off? During a Bitcoin whale sell-off , investors should prioritize research, consider their own risk tolerance, and avoid impulsive decisions. Monitoring market data, understanding the broader context, and adhering to a well-thought-out investment strategy are key. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Prices soar, portfolios multiply, and new millionaires are minted seemingly overnight. But history shows that the story doesn’t end there. Bear markets inevitably follow, stripping away excess and testing those who built fortunes in the frenzy. The interplay of these cycles defines not only financial outcomes, but also the psychology of markets. The winners are rarely those who buy at the top or panic-sell at the bottom, they are the ones who endure both phases with a strategy. And in today’s environment, where institutional adoption collides with cultural speculation, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are quietly carving out space to become part of the next wave of stories. Why bull markets create millionaires Bull markets thrive on momentum and liquidity. When capital floods into crypto, valuations climb not just because of fundamentals, but because demand overwhelms supply. Bitcoin’s surge in late 2020 created thousands of new millionaires, but it was Ethereum, DeFi tokens, and meme coins like Dogecoin that turned modest stakes into generational wealth. Part of the magic is compounding. Early adopters who entered projects before mainstream attention often saw their holdings multiply 100× or more. Bull markets amplify narratives—Ethereum’s “world computer,” Solana’s “Ethereum killer,” SHIBA INU’s meme appeal, and reward those positioned before the frenzy. The formula is simple: conviction + timing + liquidity = extraordinary outcomes. Bear markets as the ultimate test If bull runs create wealth, bear markets separate the lucky from the disciplined. The crash of 2018 saw Bitcoin fall over 80%, wiping out many who had entered late. But those who held through the storm were rewarded in the following cycle, with Bitcoin’s new highs dwarfing the losses. Similarly, Ethereum’s collapse from $1,400 to under $100 in 2019 tested faith, but patient investors reaped the rewards when ETH soared above $4,900 just two years later. Bear markets are not just financial trials, they are psychological crucibles. Fear dominates, headlines predict the “end of crypto,” and weak projects collapse. Yet this process is essential: it cleanses the ecosystem, leaving behind projects with genuine resilience. The survivors often set the stage for the next bull run. Timing and preparation The key to navigating both cycles is preparation. Bull markets reward risk-taking, but bear markets punish overexposure. Smart investors allocate only what they can afford to lose, diversify across sectors, and avoid over-leverage. Historical data shows that portfolios balanced between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and carefully chosen altcoins perform best over full cycles. Dollar-cost averaging also cushions the impact of volatility, ensuring participation in upswings without catastrophic losses in downturns. In this context, analysts stress the importance of identifying projects that can thrive across both extremes. Infrastructure plays like Ethereum offer long-term stability, while cultural or community-driven tokens provide asymmetric upside. The challenge is finding projects that combine credibility with momentum, a balance that has proven elusive in past cycles. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the conversation, not as a hedge against downturns but as an example of how cultural energy can drive opportunity in bull cycles. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out compared to earlier meme-inspired tokens is its structural foundation. The credibility that the project has matters, because history shows that audited, well-structured projects have a higher chance of surviving when the bear market inevitably arrives. At the same time, the project thrives on branding and retail enthusiasm, which are the exact forces that define explosive bull market rallies. Its community-driven growth mirrors the early days of DOGE or SHIB , but with a more deliberate architecture. In past cycles, tokens that captured cultural narratives, whether humor, rebellion, or identity, often delivered the highest multipliers. In other words, MAGACOIN FINANCE embodies the dual lesson of the cycle: it has the credibility to withstand bear markets and the narrative firepower to thrive in bull markets. That combination is rare, and it explains why traders who once dismissed it are beginning to pay closer attention. Lessons from past cycles Looking back, the names that defined each era were rarely the obvious ones. In 2017, it wasn’t just Bitcoin but tokens like XRP and Litecoin that made headlines. In 2021, it wasn’t just Ethereum but meme coins that stole the show. Each cycle brings new leaders, some institutional, some cultural. What matters most is whether investors can spot the signals early and hold through the storms. Bear markets test conviction. Those who panic-sold Ethereum under $100 never saw its climb to $4,900. Those who ignored Bitcoin under $3,000 missed its march past $60,000. And those who dismissed SHIBin its infancy missed life-changing gains . The pattern is clear: cycles create opportunities, but only those with preparation and vision capture them. Conclusion Bull markets mint millionaires because they reward timing, conviction, and community energy. Bear markets test them by stripping away excess and demanding patience. Together, they form the rhythm that defines crypto’s story. For investors, the takeaway is simple: embrace both, prepare for volatility, and recognize that opportunity exists in every phase. Ethereum may provide the backbone of institutional growth, Bitcoin may remain the global reserve asset of crypto, but tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE remind us that cultural momentum and structure can still combine to create extraordinary upside. With its audit-backed credibility and viral branding, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned not just to ride the next bull run, but to define it. That is why analysts see up to 100X potential gains , because in the world of cycles, fortune favors those who understand both sides of the story.

The renowned gold advocate and CEO of Euro Pacific Capital has once again stirred the pot, issuing a bold forecast that sees traditional precious metals soaring while the leading digital asset faces a significant downturn. Is his latest pronouncement a sign of things to come, or just another chapter in the ongoing saga between old money and new? Peter Schiff Bitcoin: The Latest Market Forecast Unpacked In a recent declaration on X, Peter Schiff didn’t mince words about his market outlook. He highlighted that spot gold was trading just under its all-time high, nearing $3,460 per ounce. Silver, not to be outdone, had already surged past the $40 mark. Schiff’s conviction is that both gold and silver are poised for even greater gains when U.S. markets open on September 2nd. However, his optimism for precious metals stands in stark contrast to his view on Peter Schiff Bitcoin . According to Schiff, Bitcoin is set to move in the opposite direction, facing a decline. This isn’t a new stance for the long-time crypto skeptic; he has consistently argued against Bitcoin’s value proposition, often referring to it as a speculative bubble rather than a legitimate store of value. Why is Peter Schiff Skeptical of Bitcoin’s Future? Schiff’s skepticism towards Bitcoin is deeply rooted. He has frequently pointed out what he perceives as fundamental flaws in the cryptocurrency’s design and market behavior. Previously, he noted that Bitcoin, despite being hailed by some as “digital gold,” was down more than 13% from its all-time high. This observation serves as a cornerstone of his argument against Bitcoin’s stability and reliability as an investment. His critique extends beyond mere price movements. Schiff argues that Bitcoin continues to struggle despite several factors that, by conventional wisdom, should propel it upwards. These include: Significant Hype: The continuous media attention and investor enthusiasm surrounding crypto. U.S. Government Support: Referring to increasing regulatory clarity and institutional adoption. Corporate Buying: Major companies allocating portions of their treasuries to Bitcoin. Despite these apparent tailwinds, Schiff sees Bitcoin faltering, reinforcing his belief that it lacks intrinsic value compared to tangible assets like gold and silver. His perspective suggests that the current market dynamics are unsustainable for the digital asset. Gold and Silver: A Traditional Safe Haven’s Resurgence While Peter Schiff Bitcoin predictions lean bearish, his outlook for gold and silver is decidedly bullish. These precious metals have historically been viewed as safe havens, particularly during times of economic uncertainty, inflation, or geopolitical instability. Their recent performance, according to Schiff, is a testament to their enduring appeal and intrinsic value. Investors often turn to gold and silver to preserve wealth, acting as a hedge against currency debasement. The tangible nature of these assets provides a sense of security that many believe digital assets cannot replicate. The ongoing global economic shifts and inflationary pressures could be contributing factors to the renewed interest in these traditional stores of value, validating Schiff’s long-held conviction. Navigating the Divide: Peter Schiff Bitcoin vs. Precious Metals The debate between proponents of Bitcoin and advocates of precious metals highlights two fundamentally different investment philosophies. On one side, we have the decentralized, digitally native asset promising a new financial paradigm. On the other, we have centuries-old commodities, valued for their scarcity, durability, and historical role in economies. For investors, understanding both perspectives is crucial. While Peter Schiff Bitcoin criticisms are vocal, many still see Bitcoin as a revolutionary technology with the potential for significant growth and a hedge against traditional financial systems. Conversely, the stability and historical track record of gold and silver offer a different kind of security. The choice often comes down to individual risk tolerance, investment goals, and belief in future economic structures. Ultimately, the market will decide which asset performs best. However, Schiff’s consistent predictions serve as a powerful reminder of the ongoing tension and divergent views within the investment landscape. Summary: What Peter Schiff’s Predictions Mean for You Peter Schiff’s latest market commentary underscores a clear divide in the investment world: a strong belief in the continued ascent of gold and silver, juxtaposed with a bearish outlook for Bitcoin. His arguments are rooted in the perceived intrinsic value and historical performance of precious metals versus the speculative nature he attributes to cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin supporters often dismiss his views, Schiff’s consistent warnings encourage a critical examination of investment strategies. As markets continue to evolve, investors must weigh these contrasting perspectives carefully to make informed decisions about their portfolios. The future performance of these assets will undoubtedly continue to fuel this fascinating debate. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Peter Schiff’s main argument against Bitcoin? A1: Peter Schiff primarily argues that Bitcoin lacks intrinsic value, is highly speculative, and is prone to significant price drops despite market hype and institutional support. He views it as a bubble that will eventually burst. Q2: Why does Peter Schiff favor gold and silver? A2: Schiff advocates for gold and silver due to their long history as tangible stores of value, their role as hedges against inflation and economic uncertainty, and their inherent scarcity and utility. He sees them as superior assets for wealth preservation. Q3: Has Peter Schiff been consistently bearish on Bitcoin? A3: Yes, Peter Schiff has been a vocal and consistent critic of Bitcoin since its early days, frequently predicting its downfall and comparing it unfavorably to precious metals. Q4: How does Bitcoin’s performance compare to gold and silver in recent times, according to Schiff? A4: According to Schiff’s recent statements, Bitcoin has been struggling, being down over 13% from its all-time high, while gold is near its peak and silver has surpassed $40, indicating strength in precious metals. Q5: What does “digital gold” mean, and why does Schiff dispute it for Bitcoin? A5: “Digital gold” is a term used by some to describe Bitcoin, suggesting it shares properties with gold as a store of value in the digital age. Schiff disputes this, arguing that Bitcoin lacks the fundamental characteristics of gold, such as tangible utility and a proven history of wealth preservation over millennia. Q6: Should investors only consider gold and silver based on Schiff’s predictions? A6: Investors should consider a diverse range of opinions and conduct their own research. While Schiff offers a compelling argument for precious metals, many experts have a positive outlook on Bitcoin. A balanced approach involves understanding various asset classes and aligning investments with personal financial goals and risk tolerance.

On-chain analysis has pointed to a significant connection: Jump Crypto WLFI . This intriguing development suggests a prominent crypto firm may be playing a pivotal role in a project linked to a well-known political family, stirring conversations about transparency and influence in the digital asset space. What’s the Buzz About Jump Crypto WLFI ? Recent findings by the sharp-eyed on-chain analyst, ai_9684xtpa, indicate that Jump Crypto appears to be the market maker for World Liberty Financial (WLFI). This isn’t just a rumor; it’s backed by specific blockchain activity. Approximately fifteen minutes before the analyst’s report, a test transfer of 47 WLFI tokens was sent directly from the World Liberty Financial multisig address to an address associated with Jump Crypto. But what does this mean, and why is it important? Market Makers Explained: A market maker provides liquidity to an exchange, facilitating trading by being ready to buy or sell assets. This ensures smooth transactions and stable prices. The WLFI Project: World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is a DeFi project that has garnered attention due to its reported ties to the Trump family. Jump Crypto’s Role: Jump Crypto is a major player in the crypto ecosystem, known for its extensive trading, investment, and infrastructure development. Their potential involvement as a market maker for WLFI adds a layer of significance to the project. This initial test transfer suggests a formal relationship or an impending one, making the Jump Crypto WLFI dynamic a focal point for many observers. Why Does a Market Maker Matter for WLFI? The presence of a reputable market maker like Jump Crypto can bring several advantages to a DeFi project, especially one like WLFI. However, it also raises questions, particularly given WLFI’s unique associations. Potential Benefits of Jump Crypto WLFI Involvement: Having a significant entity like Jump Crypto act as a market maker can be incredibly beneficial for a new or developing project. Here are some key upsides: Enhanced Liquidity: Market makers ensure there’s always a buyer and a seller, making it easier for users to trade WLFI tokens without significant price slippage. This is crucial for a healthy token ecosystem. Price Stability: By actively trading, market makers help to stabilize prices, reducing volatility and creating a more predictable trading environment for investors. Increased Credibility: The involvement of a well-established firm like Jump Crypto can lend an air of legitimacy and trust to WLFI, potentially attracting more users and investors who might otherwise be hesitant. Improved Trading Experience: Users can execute trades more efficiently and at better prices when a robust market maker is in place. For WLFI, these benefits could be instrumental in its growth and adoption within the competitive DeFi landscape. The Jump Crypto WLFI link, therefore, is not just a detail but a potential catalyst for the project’s market performance. Are There Any Challenges or Concerns? While the benefits are clear, the connection between Jump Crypto WLFI also sparks important discussions within the crypto community. The involvement of a major centralized entity in a DeFi project, especially one with political ties, can lead to certain considerations: Centralization Concerns: DeFi aims for decentralization. A single large market maker, while providing liquidity, could be seen as introducing a point of centralization, potentially influencing market dynamics more than desired. Perception and Scrutiny: Given WLFI’s link to the Trump family, any significant institutional involvement is likely to attract heightened scrutiny from regulators and the public alike. This could lead to increased pressure on both WLFI and Jump Crypto. Transparency: While on-chain data provides some transparency, the full scope of a market making agreement often remains private. The crypto community frequently calls for greater transparency in such arrangements. These are critical points for consideration as the Jump Crypto WLFI relationship evolves. It highlights the ongoing tension between the need for liquidity and the core principles of decentralization in the DeFi space. What Does This Mean for the Future of DeFi? The alleged role of Jump Crypto as a market maker for WLFI is a fascinating development that underscores the evolving landscape of decentralized finance. It illustrates how traditional financial mechanisms, like market making, are being integrated into the crypto world, often by powerful, established players. This integration brings both efficiency and questions about the future direction of decentralization. As the crypto market matures, the lines between traditional finance and DeFi continue to blur. The Jump Crypto WLFI situation serves as a prime example of this trend, inviting ongoing dialogue about governance, liquidity provision, and the influence of major institutions in a space striving for permissionless innovation. The community will undoubtedly be watching closely to see how this dynamic unfolds and what precedents it sets for future DeFi projects. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping DeFi institutional adoption . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a market maker in the context of cryptocurrency? A market maker is an individual or firm that provides liquidity to a market by being ready to buy and sell a particular asset. In crypto, they ensure there are always available orders on both sides of the order book, making it easier for traders to execute transactions and contributing to price stability. Q2: Who is ai_9684xtpa? ai_9684xtpa is an on-chain analyst known for tracking and interpreting blockchain transactions. Their analysis often provides insights into the activities of major crypto entities and projects. Q3: What is World Liberty Financial (WLFI)? World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is a decentralized finance (DeFi) project that has gained attention due to its reported links to the Trump family. Like other DeFi projects, it aims to offer financial services on the blockchain. Q4: Why is Jump Crypto’s involvement significant? Jump Crypto is a prominent and influential player in the crypto space, involved in trading, investments, and infrastructure. Their potential role as a market maker for WLFI brings significant liquidity, credibility, and potentially greater stability to the project, but also raises questions about centralization and political ties. Q5: Does this mean WLFI is now a centralized project? Not necessarily. While a large market maker can introduce a degree of centralization in liquidity provision, WLFI’s underlying protocol might still operate in a decentralized manner.

This is being followed by many as it is no longer about BTC alone, but now that is about MAGACOIN FINance as well. The token is being discussed just like Pepe before it exploded. Analysts are posing the big question: can it actually reap 2500% gains as that run did? Whales Get Back In Buying Mode Bitcoin whales are on the rise even as the market is falling. The new report by CryptoQuant indicated that holders of short-term positions are currently incurring losses due to prices falling under the level of $111k. Retail traders sold in panic and old whales took the opportunity to get more supply. At press time, Bitcoin was slightly above 110k , and the majority of altcoins are also trending down. Analysts believe that such whale pickups may actually assist the market to reset the next leg up. On-chain data also indicates that newer investors have incurred approximately a 3.5% loss, yet traders that are holding over 1-6 months are still in profit. Researchers described it as a purge of weak hands – a cycle that long-term whales typically wait to happen. The market continues to be influenced by institutional activity. Companies such as MicroStrategy, Metaplanet and Semler Scientific continue to pile up Bitcoin. This has increased the whale holdings and held the market as the retail exits. Bitcoin Price Levels to Watch On the technical charts, Bitcoin price is breaking lower in a descending triangle and is in short-term consolidation. The recent price action indicated a lower high of $124,517 and lower low of $108,717. BTC price is now trading with a key resistance level at about $113,000. Notably, support is near $108,500, whereas resistance is observed at $117,500 and $124,500. Analysts note that a breakout above $117, 500 with high volume can make it bullish again. In case the support at 108,000 fails, however, bears might take over. The 4-hour chart also pointed to a potential turnaround. BTC established a higher high and higher low at around $108,700, and there was green volume coming in. When it breaks through the $113,500 area, traders have potential to see a more aggressive rise. MAGACOIN FINANCE Draws Whale Attention Bitcoin whales are accumulating a new presale token quietly, and analysts wonder whether it would yield 2500% profits like early Pepe. These inflows are finding their way into MAGACOIN FINANCE as the parallels of the Pepe breakout continue to strengthen with early investors gaining life-changing returns. Trust has increased since the project has withstood two audits by CertiK and HashEx , both of which declared the project to be secure in terms of smart contracts. To whales, that confidence is paramount prior to big distributions, and now the smaller investors are scrambling- in as well, to fear not getting in before the broad market catches on. Final Take Bitcoin whales have returned to buying mode and charts are pointing to a potential turnaround out of recent lows. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is warming at whale circles. Security is now secured, and hype is rising, and many are beginning to consider this might be the play to watch with the next Bitcoin big swing.

ETH is now showing bearish signs and might gain bearish momentum if it drops below $4,340. Ethereum is still struggling to settle above the $4,500 zone. The price is trading below $4,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $4,460 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could extend losses and dive if there is a close below $4,340 in the near term. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price started a recovery wave after it tested the $4,260 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to climb above the $4,320 and $4,350 resistance levels. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $4,660 swing high to the $4,261 low. However, the bears remained active near the $4,480 resistance zone. There were two attempts, but the bulls failed to gain strength to clear $4,500. The 61.8% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $4,660 swing high to the $4,261 low is acting as a barrier. The price reacted to the downside below $4,450. Ethereum price is now trading below $4,450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $4,460 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,450 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,480 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,500 level. A clear move above the $4,500 resistance might send the price toward the $4,565 resistance. An upside break above the $4,565 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,650 resistance zone or even $4,720 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,500 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,375 level. The first major support sits near the $4,340 zone. A clear move below the $4,340 support might push the price toward the $4,320 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,260 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $4,150.

Leading this downturn are significant ETH liquidations , which have captured the attention of traders and analysts alike. In just one day, Ethereum alone accounted for a massive $58 million in liquidations, predominantly from long positions. This dramatic event serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility in digital asset trading. What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations, and Why Do They Matter? Crypto liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position is automatically closed by an exchange. This happens because their margin balance falls below a required threshold, often due to adverse price movements. Essentially, if you borrow funds to amplify your bet on a cryptocurrency’s price and the market moves against you, the exchange will forcefully sell your assets to cover the loan. For those holding leveraged ‘long’ positions, betting on a price increase, a sudden market drop can trigger these closures, leading to substantial losses. Conversely, a sharp price surge can liquidate ‘short’ positions, which are bets on price decreases. Understanding these mechanics is crucial for navigating the high-stakes world of cryptocurrency trading. The Stark Reality: ETH Liquidations Lead the Pack Over the past 24 hours, the liquidation data paints a clear picture of intense market pressure across major cryptocurrencies. Ethereum (ETH) stands out with the highest figures, indicating significant volatility for the asset and its traders. BTC Liquidations: $27.62 million (88.16% long) ETH Liquidations: $58.03 million (72.1% long) SOL Liquidations: $13.35 million (88.17% long) The overwhelming majority of these liquidations were from ‘long’ positions. This means that many traders were betting on price increases for these assets. A swift and unexpected market correction, therefore, caught a large number of these optimistic traders off guard, resulting in widespread forced closures. Why Did ETH Liquidations Skyrocket to $58 Million? Ethereum, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, often experiences significant trading volume and open interest in its perpetual futures. Its recent price movements, influenced by broader market sentiment, specific network developments, or macroeconomic factors, likely played a crucial role in triggering such substantial ETH liquidations . When prices move sharply against leveraged bets, especially for an asset with high liquidity like Ethereum, the cascade of liquidations can intensify market downturns. This creates a feedback loop where falling prices trigger more liquidations, pushing prices down further. This phenomenon can lead to rapid and dramatic shifts in market dynamics. Navigating Volatility: How Can Traders Mitigate Risks from ETH Liquidations? Understanding the mechanics of ETH liquidations is crucial for any trader operating in the crypto space. To protect your capital and navigate these volatile periods, consider adopting robust risk management strategies: Set Stop-Loss Orders: These orders automatically sell your asset if it drops to a predetermined price, limiting potential losses before a liquidation occurs. Avoid Excessive Leverage: While leverage can amplify gains, it also significantly increases the risk of liquidation. Use it cautiously and only with capital you can afford to lose. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Spreading your investments across different assets can cushion the impact of a downturn in any single cryptocurrency. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technical analysis, and fundamental developments that could impact asset prices. Knowledge is a powerful tool against unexpected market shifts. The recent surge in ETH liquidations serves as a powerful reminder that even established cryptocurrencies are subject to intense market fluctuations. For traders, it underscores the critical importance of prudent risk management and a clear understanding of leveraged trading. While the allure of amplified gains is strong, the potential for swift losses, as demonstrated by Ethereum’s recent figures, is equally significant. Stay vigilant, trade responsibly, and prioritize the protection of your capital in this dynamic market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a crypto liquidation? A crypto liquidation is the automatic closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when their margin balance falls below a required maintenance level due to adverse price movements. Why did ETH liquidations lead other cryptocurrencies in the last 24 hours? ETH liquidations led due to a combination of Ethereum’s high trading volume, significant open interest in its perpetual futures, and specific market movements that went against the majority of leveraged long positions, triggering a cascade of forced sales. What does it mean for a ‘long’ position to be liquidated? A ‘long’ position is a bet that an asset’s price will increase. When a long position is liquidated, it means the price fell significantly, causing the trader’s collateral to drop below the required margin, leading to the automatic closure of their position and loss of capital. How can traders protect themselves from significant ETH liquidations? Traders can protect themselves by using stop-loss orders, avoiding excessive leverage, diversifying their portfolios, and staying informed about market trends and news to anticipate potential price shifts.

Bitcoin Risks Sliding to $100K After 6% Monthly Drop,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/01/red-september-bitcoin-risks-sliding-to-usd100k-after-8-monthly-drop,"This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Bitcoin (BTC) has breached key support levels in a sign of increasing bearish momentum that suggests a risk of a slide to $100,000. The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell 6.5% in August, ending the four-month winning streak as the U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) bled $751 million, according to data source SoSoValue . The recent price drop saw bitcoin break below several key support levels, including the Ichimoku cloud, and the 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages (SMAs). It also pierced crucial horizontal support zones formed by the May high of $111,965 and the December high of $109,364, according to the daily chart sourced from TradingView. These breakdowns underscore growing market weakness, confirming a bearish shift in key momentum indicators such as the Guppy Multiple Moving Average (GMMA) and the MACD histogram. The short-term exponential moving average (EMA) band of the GMMA (green) has crossed below the longer-term band (red), signaling a clear bearish momentum shift. Meanwhile, the weekly MACD histogram has dropped below zero, indicating a transition from a bullish to a bearish trend. Together, these signals indicate a likelihood of a sustained sell-off, potentially driving the price down to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $101,366, and possibly to the $100,000 mark. The negative technical outlook aligns with seasonal trends, which show September historically as a bearish month for bitcoin. Since 2013, BTC has delivered an average return of -3.49%, closing lower in eight of the past 12 September months, according to data from Coinglass. As for bulls, overcoming the lower high of $113,510 set on Aug. 28 is crucial to negating the bearish outlook. Support: $105,240 (the 38.2% Fib retracement of the April-August rally), $101,366 (the 200-day SMA), $100,000. Resistance: $110,756 (the lower end of the Ichimoku cloud), $113,510 (the lower high), $115,938 (the 50-day SMA).",Markets|Bitcoin ETF|Markets|Technical Analysis|News,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-01 03:24:45

For many investors, the promise of innovation is often overshadowed by concerns about market integrity. This is precisely why the recent pledge by Lee Eog-weon, South Korea’s nominee for chairman of the Financial Services Commission (FSC), marks a pivotal moment. He has committed to taking a firm and decisive stance against unfair crypto trading practices, signaling a new era of enhanced protection for users in the virtual asset market. Why is South Korea Cracking Down on Unfair Crypto Trading? The rapid growth of the cryptocurrency market has unfortunately attracted illicit activities. Issues like insider trading, market manipulation, and other deceptive schemes have plagued the space, eroding investor trust and creating an uneven playing field. These challenges highlight the urgent need for robust regulatory frameworks. Eroding Trust: Unfair practices undermine confidence in the entire virtual asset ecosystem. Investor Vulnerability: Individual investors, in particular, are often at a disadvantage against sophisticated manipulators. Market Integrity: A healthy market requires transparency and fair competition. Lee Eog-weon’s commitment directly addresses these critical concerns. His pledge underscores South Korea’s dedication to fostering a safe and transparent environment for all participants, moving beyond the current challenges to build a more secure future for digital assets. This proactive approach aims to safeguard the interests of ordinary users. Understanding the Virtual Asset User Protection Act A significant step towards combating unfair crypto trading is the Virtual Asset User Protection Act. This landmark legislation, set to be implemented in July 2024, provides the legal teeth necessary for regulators to investigate and penalize wrongdoing effectively. It’s not just a declaration; it’s a concrete legal framework designed to bring accountability. During his confirmation hearing before the National Assembly’s National Policy Committee, Lee highlighted the act’s importance. He noted that it establishes a clear legal basis for: Investigating Illegal Activities: Granting authorities the power to scrutinize suspicious transactions and market behaviors. Punishing Offenders: Imposing strict penalties on those found guilty of insider trading, market manipulation, and other forms of unfair crypto trading . Protecting User Assets: Laying down guidelines to safeguard virtual assets held by users.

The company recently secured a highly coveted Singapore payments license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). This pivotal milestone not only solidifies QCP Trading’s operational framework but also highlights Singapore’s strategic positioning as a leading, regulated hub for cryptocurrency operations globally. What Does a Singapore Payments License Mean for Crypto Firms? Obtaining a Major Payment Institution (MPI) license from the MAS is far more than just a permit; it represents a rigorous endorsement of a firm’s operational integrity and commitment to regulatory compliance. For any cryptocurrency entity, this license grants the legal authority to offer crucial digital payment token services, including the buying and selling of DPTs, to both individual and institutional clients within Singapore’s stringent regulatory perimeter. It serves as a powerful stamp of approval, assuring stakeholders of a firm’s adherence to robust financial and security standards. This comprehensive licensing framework ensures that regulated entities maintain high standards across various operational facets. It covers: Enhanced Trust and Credibility: Clients gain immense confidence when engaging with a firm that operates under a recognized and respected regulatory framework. This trust is paramount in the often-volatile crypto space. Expanded Market Access: The license opens doors to a significantly broader client base, particularly attracting traditional financial institutions and high-net-worth individuals who typically demand regulated partners for their digital asset activities. Robust Operational Security: License holders are mandated to implement stringent risk management frameworks, state-of-the-art cybersecurity protocols, and comprehensive anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financing of terrorism (CFT) measures. This protects both the firm and its clients. Why is this a Game-Changer for QCP Trading? For QCP Trading, securing the Singapore payments license is nothing short of transformative. As a significant participant in the OTC spot DPT trading arena, this regulatory approval elevates their operational legitimacy and empowers them to significantly expand their range of services. It marks a crucial transition from operating in a largely unregulated or less defined environment to a fully structured and supervised one, which is absolutely vital for attracting sophisticated investors and managing large-volume trades. This prestigious license firmly establishes QCP Trading as a trusted and reliable entity, fully capable of executing substantial transactions while consistently adhering to global best practices. Furthermore, it provides a clear and stable regulatory framework within which they can innovate, potentially leading to the development of new and exciting products and services that cater to the evolving and increasingly complex demands of the global crypto market. This regulatory clarity is a major competitive advantage. How Does Singapore Attract Leading Crypto Firms with its Payments License? Singapore has meticulously cultivated its reputation as a visionary and progressive financial hub, and its approach to regulating digital assets is a prime example of this foresight. The MAS has strategically adopted a balanced yet incredibly robust regulatory framework, expertly designed to foster genuine innovation while effectively mitigating systemic risks. This clarity, coupled with a proactive regulatory stance, makes the Singapore payments license exceptionally desirable for crypto firms worldwide seeking a stable, reputable, and forward-looking base of operations. The comprehensive regulatory environment here provides a distinct competitive edge, successfully attracting top-tier global crypto players who prioritize certainty and a level playing field. This approach not only encourages responsible growth and development within the industry but also helps to identify and deter less scrupulous operators, thereby cultivating a healthier, more secure, and more sustainable ecosystem for all market participants. It’s a win-win for both innovation and protection. The benefits extend beyond just the licensed entity: Increased Investor Confidence: Knowing a firm holds a Singapore payments license assures investors of its legitimacy, transparency, and unwavering adherence to strict financial and ethical standards. Bridging Traditional and Digital Finance: This regulatory approval plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between traditional financial services and the burgeoning crypto sector, significantly facilitating institutional adoption and mainstream integration. Global Recognition and Reputation: A license from the MAS carries substantial weight and recognition on an international scale, dramatically boosting QCP Trading’s global reputation and market standing. QCP Trading’s remarkable achievement in securing the Singapore payments license from the MAS marks a truly significant chapter for both the company and the broader cryptocurrency industry within Singapore. It powerfully underscores the ongoing maturation of the digital asset space and highlights the increasing, undeniable importance of stringent regulatory compliance in fostering sustainable growth. As more responsible firms follow suit, Singapore is unequivocally set to further solidify its already strong reputation as a leading, globally recognized, and highly regulated hub for digital payment tokens, thereby paving the way for even greater innovation, widespread adoption, and long-term stability in the years ahead.

While Hyperliquid (HYPE) just hit a new all-time high, smart investors are already looking beyond the hype to the next breakout opportunity — and one early-stage opportunity, MAGACOIN FINANCE , is quickly capturing attention as the project with real long-term potential. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Hits $51.11 — Record Volumes and Arthur Hayes’ Bold 126x Prediction On August 27, 2025 , Hyperliquid (HYPE) surged to a record $51.11 , cementing its place as one of the most talked-about decentralized exchange (DEX) tokens of the year. Currently trading between $48-50 , HYPE has already delivered an eye-watering 430% year-to-date gain and a 15x rally since its debut in late 2024. The growth has been fueled by record-breaking $357B in derivatives trading volume in August, plus over $105M in trading fees generated in just one month. The platform now dominates 67-70% of the decentralized derivatives market . Adding fuel to the rally, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes shocked the crypto world with his prediction that HYPE could surge 126x by 2028 , calling it the “decentralized Binance” and projecting it could become the largest exchange of any type in the coming years. With innovations like HIP-3 permissionless markets , institutional adoption via BitGo , and integrations with Phantom Wallet , HYPE’s momentum is undeniable. But here’s the key: at a $16B market cap , many believe the easy money has already been made. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Be the Next Major Crypto Success Story MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its early stage phase, allowing investors the unique opportunity to get in ahead of the influx of money. While HYPE already commands a multibillion-dollar valuation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still trading at a tiny fraction of that. This means massive room for upside growth. Early adopters locking in positions before major exchange exposure ignites a rally are positioning themselves for potentially life-changing gains. For investors who missed the early days of Bitcoin and Ethereum, this is the long-awaited second chance. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early access offers the kind of ground-floor opportunity that history shows can transform modest investments into massive returns. Final Thoughts Hyperliquid (HYPE) keeps breaking records and with Arthur Hayes forecasting a very bright future, the investor eyes are definitely turned towards high-growth DeFi tokens again. However, the game-changing profits are moving from HYPE to the ones that are at the seed stage as their market caps are going sky-high. That’s why more and more analysts are pointing to MAGACOIN FINANCE as the next crypto rocket ship . Arthur Hayes believes HYPE can 126x by 2028. What will happen with tokens that are just starting now? History shows the biggest returns in crypto always go to early-stage plays — and that’s exactly where MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned.

Here’s the Next Target,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-flashes-cup-and-handle-pattern-heres-the-next-target/,"Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a well-followed analyst on X, shared a chart outlining what he identifies as a developing cup and handle pattern for XRP. The post highlights the technical setup that traders often associate with long-term bullish continuation. The cup and handle pattern is a chart formation that typically indicates consolidation followed by a potential breakout. It consists of a rounded bottom resembling a cup, followed by a short-term retracement forming the handle. In classical analysis, the breakout from the handle can lead to a continuation of the prior uptrend, with measurable price targets based on the depth of the cup. In Steph’s chart, XRP’s price has carved out the rounded bottom over several months, culminating in a neckline that marks the upper boundary of the pattern. The handle, forming just below this neckline, suggests a period of consolidation before any potential move higher. #XRP Cup and Handle! pic.twitter.com/pECeBwiwCQ — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 31, 2025 How the Pattern Formed Looking at the chart, the cup portion began developing after XRP’s decline in February. The asset faced pressures due to the Trump administration’s tariff policies and fell below the $3 level in early February . The asset struggled below this level for another few months, declining further and reaching its lowest point of 2025 in April. Following this, a gradual buildup began as XRP formed the rest of the cup. This move culminated in a rise to a new all-time high of $3.65 in July. In early August, the asset began facing bearish pressure again, losing the $3 support once more . This bearish pressure formed the handle, and XRP’s decline over the past few days has confirmed the handle formation, completing the pattern. XRP is currently trading at $ 2.80, and the chart indicates that it has reached a crucial support level that could trigger a significant rebound and confirm a breakout from this pattern. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Potential Targets If XRP were to break out as outlined in the chart, the projected move could be significant. The technical measurement for the pattern generally involves applying the depth of the cup to the breakout point. In this case, the chart shows that XRP could reach $7 . This move represents a 150% increase for the digital asset, with the potential for further growth, as reaching that level will require breaking through multiple resistance levels and building incredible momentum. The structure highlights both the resilience of XRP at higher price ranges and the potential for a substantial upside if resistance is broken, and all XRP has to do is close above the handle and maintain that momentum.

The price is now declining and might extend losses if it drops below $2.70. XRP price is correcting gains below the $3.00 resistance. The price is now trading below $2.850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.80 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to decline if it stays below the $2.850 zone. XRP Price Dips Below Support XRP price started a fresh decline below $3.00, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price traded below the $2.950 and $2.920 levels to enter a bearish zone. The bears were able to push the price below $2.850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Finally, the price declined below $2.80 and tested $2.74. A low was formed at $2.738 and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.040 swing high to the $2.738 low. The price is now trading below $2.80 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.80 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. If the bulls protect the $2.720 support, the price could attempt another increase. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.80 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.820 level. A clear move above the $2.820 resistance might send the price toward the $2.850 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.90 resistance or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.040 swing high to the $2.738 low. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.00. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.820 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.720 level. The next major support is near the $2.650 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.650 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.60.

August served as a stark reminder of this reality, as the cryptocurrency industry faced a substantial blow. A staggering $163 million was lost to crypto hacks across 16 separate incidents, according to blockchain security firm PeckShield. This alarming figure highlights the persistent challenges in securing digital wealth. It also underscores the sophisticated threats that platforms and individual users constantly encounter. The financial impact was substantial, leaving many in the community deeply concerned about the safety of their investments. What Was the True Cost of August’s Crypto Hacks? The total amount lost in August represents an approximately 15% increase from the $142 million reported in July. This indicates a worrying upward trend in security breaches within the crypto space. These incidents were not isolated to a single type of attack or platform. Instead, they showcased a diverse range of vulnerabilities exploited by malicious actors. The largest portion of these losses, an astonishing $91.4 million, stemmed from multiple anonymous Bitcoin (BTC) addresses. This particular detail is significant. It suggests a broad range of potential attack vectors. These could range from individual wallet compromises to sophisticated phishing scams targeting unidentifiable holders. Moreover, the incidents extended to well-known entities: BtcTurk: This prominent Turkish cryptocurrency exchange was hit, resulting in a substantial loss of $54 million. Such an attack on a centralized exchange often impacts a large number of users simultaneously, eroding trust and causing widespread disruption. odin.fun: Another incident targeted odin.fun, leading to a $7 million loss. While smaller in scale than the BtcTurk breach, it still contributes to the overall picture of vulnerability within the ecosystem. These figures from PeckShield paint a clear picture: crypto hacks are a pervasive and evolving threat. It’s a challenge the industry simply cannot afford to ignore. The methods are becoming more sophisticated, and the targets are increasingly diverse. Why Are Crypto Hacks Becoming More Frequent? The continuous rise in crypto hacks can be attributed to several interconnected factors. As the crypto market expands and attracts more participants, it naturally becomes a more lucrative target for cybercriminals. The decentralized nature of many crypto projects, while offering distinct benefits, can also present complex security challenges if not implemented with extreme care. Furthermore, human error remains a significant vulnerability. This includes falling for phishing scams or failing to adopt strong security practices. The rapid pace of innovation in the blockchain space means new protocols and platforms are constantly emerging. While this innovation is exciting, it also means that security audits and robust testing might not always keep pace. This can leave exploitable loopholes for attackers. Malicious actors are quick to identify and exploit these vulnerabilities, often using advanced techniques that require deep technical understanding. Essential Defenses: Protecting Your Assets from Crypto Hacks Given the alarming trend of crypto hacks , what steps can individuals and platforms take to safeguard their digital assets? Proactive security measures are no longer optional; they are absolutely essential. Here are some actionable insights to protect your investments: Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Always use 2FA on all your crypto accounts and wallets. Hardware-based 2FA (like YubiKey) is generally more secure than SMS-based 2FA. Utilize Hardware Wallets: For significant holdings, hardware wallets (e.g., Ledger, Trezor) offer superior security. They keep your private keys offline, making them impervious to online hacks. Beware of Phishing Scams: Always double-check URLs and email senders meticulously. Malicious actors often create fake websites or send deceptive emails to trick users into revealing their credentials. Never click suspicious links. Regularly Update Software: Keep your operating system, antivirus software, and crypto wallet applications updated. This helps patch known vulnerabilities and strengthens your defenses. Employ Strong, Unique Passwords: Use complex, unique passwords for each of your crypto-related accounts. A reputable password manager can significantly help you manage these securely. Continuous Education: Stay informed about the latest security threats and best practices in the crypto space. Knowledge and vigilance are your first lines of defense against crypto hacks . For platforms and projects, rigorous security audits, well-funded bug bounty programs, and continuous monitoring are paramount. Collaborating with specialized blockchain security firms like PeckShield can provide invaluable expertise in identifying and mitigating risks before they escalate into costly breaches. A Call for Enhanced Blockchain Security Against Crypto Hacks The $163 million lost to crypto hacks in August serves as a powerful reminder of the urgent need for enhanced security measures across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. While the industry continues to innovate and grow, it must also prioritize the safety and trust of its users. Every hack, regardless of its size, erodes confidence and hinders mainstream adoption. By fostering a culture of robust security practices, continuous vigilance, and collaborative efforts, the crypto community can work towards a more secure future. This ensures that the incredible potential of blockchain technology is realized without constant threats looming overhead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What was the total amount lost to crypto hacks in August? According to blockchain security firm PeckShield, the cryptocurrency industry lost a total of $163 million across 16 separate hacking incidents in August. 2. Which incidents contributed most to the August losses? The largest portion, $91.4 million, came from multiple anonymous BTC addresses. Other significant incidents included hacks targeting BtcTurk ($54 million) and odin.fun ($7 million). 3. Why are crypto hacks increasing? The increase can be attributed to the growing crypto market, sophisticated cybercriminal tactics, complex security challenges in decentralized systems, human error, and new protocols emerging faster than comprehensive security audits can keep pace. 4. What are the most effective ways to protect my crypto assets? Key measures include enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), using hardware wallets for significant holdings, being vigilant against phishing scams, regularly updating software, employing strong unique passwords, and continuously educating yourself on security best practices. 5. How do blockchain security firms like PeckShield help? Firms like PeckShield provide essential services such as rigorous security audits, bug bounty programs, and continuous monitoring. They help identify and mitigate risks before they can result in costly breaches for platforms and projects. 6. What is the long-term impact of these hacks on the crypto industry? Consistent crypto hacks erode user confidence, hinder mainstream adoption, and can lead to increased regulatory scrutiny. However, they also drive innovation in security solutions and foster a stronger emphasis on robust protective measures within the ecosystem.

His visit to Japan follows his attendance at the Bitcoin Asia conference in Hong Kong last week. In March, Japan’s largest Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet, appointed Eric Trump as its advisor . The company, which boasts holdings exceeding $2 billion in Bitcoin, said at the time, his appointment would foster Metaplanet’s “Bitcoin adoption.” Metaplanet currently holds 18,991 Bitcoin, valued at $2.04 billion. Metaplanet, previously a hotel operator, has announced plans to raise 180.3 billion yen ($1.2 billion) through an overseas share issuance, with $837 million earmarked for fresh BTC purchases. Besides, American Bitcoin, co-founded by Eric Trump and his brother Donald Trump Jr, is keen on listing on Nasdaq soon. The company is finalizing a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining. Trump brothers, together with Hut 8, will hold a combined 98% of the entity, post-merger. Asher Genoot, CEO of American Bitcoin, confirmed Eric Trump’s attendance at the Metaplanet meeting, as reported by Bloomberg earlier. Metaplanet is thrilled to welcome Eric Trump to our newly formed Strategic Board of Advisors. His business expertise and passion for BTC will help drive our mission forward as we continue building one of the world’s leading Bitcoin Treasury Companies. Welcome aboard @EricTrump ! pic.twitter.com/c0bpC1ojcg — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) March 21, 2025 Metaplanet Shareholders Due to Vote on Fund-Raising Proposal Amid Eric Trump Visit Eric Trump’s Monday meeting will involve a vote by Metaplanet shareholders on a capital-raising proposal, per a Reuters report . The plan would sell 550 million new shares overseas, raising 130.3 billion yen ($884.41 million), primarily for Bitcoin purchases. Metaplanet, formerly known as Red Planet Japan, has seen its shares skyrocket by nearly 760% in the past year. Metaplanet Stock Sinks – Fundraising Crisis Ahead? The shares of the Japanese aggressive Bitcoin accumulation firm tumbles, threatening the Metaplanet’s capital raising model. The shares have fallen 2.62% on Monday per Yahoo Finance data , putting its fundraising proposal under stress. In an interview with Bloomberg, Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich called the preferred shares a “defensive mechanism,” that would allow capital infusion without diluting common shareholders if the stock tumbles further. Metaplanet is aiming for a stash of 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026, and 210,000 BTC by 2027. In other words, it wants to multiply its current holdings by more than 11.

This announcement builds on the recent appointment of Bybit Co-CEO Helen Liu and Head of Spot Emily Bao — also the founder of Byreal — as key advisors to Mantle . Their involvement reflects a deeper alignment between Bybit and Mantle to accelerate Layer 2 infrastructure and position MNT as a bridge between Web2 and Web3. Mantle × Bybit Roadmap: Phased Rollout What began as a single token has now become a broader force within Bybit, powering use cases from trading to payments and savings. With Mantle 2.0, MNT is set to unlock even greater opportunities for users around the world, serving as a bridge between digital assets, real-world applications, and institutional adoption. The roadmap details how MNT utilities will expand in waves through August, September, and beyond: Buy — Currently available through spot trading, Convert, OTC with fixed pricing, and Bybit’s auto-invest bot. Starting late September, “Discount Buy” will launch with support for lockup products at reduced prices. Use — From September, spot pairs will expand from 4 to over 20. By late September, MNT can be used to pay trading fees (25% off Spot, 10% off Derivatives), card payments with zero conversion fee, and Web3 purchases. Options trading and access to VIP events and merchandise with MNT are also planned. Hold — From early September, institutional users will unlock higher leverage (up to 8x) and extended fixed-loan terms. Later in the month, retail users will gain multipliers for faster VIP upgrades and enhanced cashback via Bybit Card & Pay. Earn — Fixed-term savings roll out at the end of August, alongside higher allocations for new token launches (e.g., HODLVerse, Launchpool, and Megadrop). Users can also access flexible savings, dual asset products, and liquidity mining. Limited Offers — Ongoing campaigns like MNT Puzzle Hunt and Wednesday Airdrops will be joined by regional cashback promotions (end of September) and a Mantle-themed anniversary celebration in October. The phased rollout aims to make MNT more than a speculative asset — embedding it into daily trading, payments, and wealth management for both institutional and retail users. By supporting real-world and Web3 payments, expanding trading options, and tying MNT to membership privileges, the roadmap brings Mantle closer to its mission of driving meaningful adoption. #Bybit / #TheCryptoArk /#IMakeIt About Bybit Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 70 million users.

50999172,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/top-5-signs-a-crypto-is-about-to-explode/,1756701000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50999172.jpeg,Top 5 Signs a Crypto Is About to Explode,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/top-5-signs-a-crypto-is-about-to-explode/,"People earn the most money from crypto when they know about it before everyone else. We’ve heard it time and again, but early entrants to projects, like Ethereum have seen success in noticing what others have ignored. Can you distinguish between signs of a future boom and pure hype? For every crypto surge, there are a set of key elements to consider: high transaction rates, rise in whales interest, the option to buy on more platforms, people getting more excited, and the story narrative dominating popular communities.. As these conversations continue, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are showing how these signals merge to create huge momentum. 1. Rising on-chain activity Generally, an uptick in on-chain activity precedes a big market boom. This situation can include increased wallets, bigger transaction amounts, or improved developers. In the year 2017, Ethereum’s platform began to see big increases in transactions before the price went up. Santiment and Glassnode use similar tools and metrics. As Solana’s values have increased, the number of NFT prints and trading sessions has also gone up, and it only becomes clear after these numbers increase before the rise. 2. Narrative dominance Each cycle generates specific stories that influence investment decisions. In 2017, it was ICOs. In 2021, DeFi and NFTs led the charge. Cryptocurrency analysts predict growth in the future, with assets, AI technology, and meme coins set to rise. Investors should identify the narrative that resonates and invest in it first. When interest levels are low, narratives grow intensly as media attention rapidly increases. Signals like these are not theoretical, they are being observed right now. And for many retail investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a case study where these factors intersect. Unlike traditional hedge assets, MAGACOIN thrives entirely on cultural branding, community, and scarcity. Its presale stages have consistently sold out in record time, demonstrating overwhelming demand. Social sentiment trackers report MAGACOIN-related mentions rising faster than most mid-cap tokens, while Telegram activity continues to accelerate. Forecast models suggest potential gains of up to 60x for early entrants, underscoring why timing matters. For investors seeking breakout momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is less about hedging risk and more about riding a rocket when all five signals align. 3. Whale accumulation Large holders often act before retail catches on. Whale wallets that absorb supply lead to less liquidity being available on exchange, forcing higher prices up. In 2021, the rise of Bitcoin in value had been forecasted by tracking certain whales. In 2025, we will see a similar behavior towards many of the lesser mid-cap altcoins. During this time, they will mostly be found near mid-cap DeFi’s and AI-linked token’s. Large groups of whales quietly accumulating stocks is a strong indication that a huge rally may occur. 4. Exchange listings and liquidity expansion Investors become interested when a project becomes listed on a major exchange. Shiba Inu experienced a rally in 2021, which at the time had access to bigger platforms. Big listings expand these niche projects to a wider audience. In just a few years, investors are going to start looking for more new listings of exchanges for some specific types of coins, which have lots of supporters who demand those exchanges. 5. Surging community engagement The growth of cryptocurrency is largely due to community involvement. When many people come together with passion for a project, they turn it into something that will change their lives. Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Pepe secured spots in the market with the help of their passionate group of supporters. Experts look at what people are doing on Telegram,, Discord, and platforms like Twitter as signs of the economy. Sudden increases in interest among investors then bring on new funds, as well as attention. Blending strategy with signals While the signs are valuable, they can only be understood with more in depth analysis and planning. Continue investing in reliable opportunities, diversifying investments across various sectors, and limit exposure initially. Losing money in the market happens when everything rises, but trends aren’t solid. But picking patterns and seeing how everything responds really matters. With the economy being uncertain, investors have a good opportunity to catch a great profit by combining these two important things together. Conclusion To make huge returns on crypto investments, a person must recognise the early signs of the process. Some signs that signal the oncoming success of Bitcoin include increasing online use, growing investment, expanding opportunities, and rising grassroots enthusiasm and media attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE is an ideal project that combines scarcity, social buzz, narrative energy, and momentum. That is why experts are predicting 60x returns for investors who enter early.

Stablecoin supply and DeFi deposits are at multi-month lows. Analysts suggest that potential rate cuts in September could spark a resurgence in liquidity. The price of Ethereum has recently come under pressure, dipping to $4,200 just days after reaching an all-time high of nearly $5,000. This price drop can be explained by recent on-chain data, which reveals a divergence in market behavior. Liquidity metrics such as stablecoin supply and DeFi deposits have fallen to multi-month lows. Meanwhile, adoption indicators, including active addresses and transactions, are at record highs. This suggests that Ethereum may be shifting from a yield-driven market to a utility-led ecosystem, with potential rate cuts in September possibly acting as a catalyst for the next price breakout.

According to Coinglass , 24-hour trading volume for WLFI derivatives jumped more than 530% to $3.95b on Monday, while open interest rose over 60% $931.9m. The spike comes just hours before the unlock event, scheduled for 8:00 a.m. ET. The project will free up 20% of the tokens purchased in its earliest rounds, priced at $0.015 and US$0.05, which can be claimed through a process called the Lockbox. These unlocked tokens amount to about 5% of total supply. At current prices, early backers in the lowest round stand to gain over twenty times their investment. WLFI Trading Begins Sept. 1 With Investors Restricted To Selling One-Fifth WLFI was issued as a governance token for World Liberty Financial, designed to let holders vote on upgrades to the protocol. Trading officially begins on Sept. 1, but early investors are allowed to sell only one-fifth of their allocations. Trump-linked World Liberty Financial token is set to begin trading after a 99.94% approval vote, paving the way for market speculation and a potential rise in Trump’s crypto holdings. #WorldLibertyFinancial #WLFI https://t.co/OL1BFHAx5G — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 17, 2025 Founders, including Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, are excluded from this initial release. The launch will test how much the Trump name can lift the value of the 100 billion-token supply. In pre-market trading, some platforms have priced WLFI at about $0.42. That implies a fully diluted valuation of nearly $40b. This level would rank it within the top 45 digital assets. Some investors believe it could break into the top 20, a leap that would encourage more exchanges to list it. World Liberty Financial’s Youth Belies Its Political Weight World Liberty Financial is barely a year old, but it has drawn unusual attention due to its ties to the Trump family. The president promoted it on social media before taking office, while developer Steven Witkoff is listed as co-founder. The family has broadened its footprint in crypto over the past year, adding ventures in stablecoins, Bitcoin mining and digital asset funds. Each has extended the Trump brand into corners of speculative finance at a time when regulation has begun to tilt more favourably toward the industry. Since returning to the White House, Trump has signed a law governing stablecoins . He has also installed regulators viewed as more supportive of digital assets. Meanwhile, his sons have pushed family businesses further into crypto ventures. As a result, WLFI is now presented as a bridge between legacy finance and the open economy, with hopes of drawing retail liquidity. Founders’ Tokens Stay Locked Pending Governance Vote The family’s financial stake is significant. DT Marks DEFI LLC, an entity tied to Trump and his relatives, reportedly owns 38% of WLF Holdco, which controls World Liberty and its revenues after expenses. The entity also holds 22.5b WLFI tokens, and has already collected fees equal to 75% of token sale proceeds. Founders’ tokens remain locked until WLFI holders vote on a release schedule. As a result, their future value depends entirely on the governance process. Meanwhile, retail investors must act quickly. They need to decide whether to sell into the rally now or hold their tokens for longer-term gains as WLFI debuts across major exchanges.

BlockDAG’s 2049% Bonus Is Turning Token2049 Into Its Stage,https://thecoinrise.com/can-toncoin-hit-6-84-or-hype-reach-51-blockdags-2049-bonus-is-turning-token2049-into-its-stage/,"Momentum in crypto often hinges on timing, volume, and exposure. Toncoin is climbing into the spotlight as it nears critical support, with analysts suggesting a potential run toward $6.84. Hyperliquid is holding steady around $45, but signals indicate a possible surge beyond $51. Yet it’s BlockDAG (BDAG) that has shifted the conversation. With a 2049% bonus released ahead of Token2049 Singapore, the project didn’t just react to market dynamics, it reshaped them. Rather than following a conventional path, BlockDAG’s aggressive step has elevated it far beyond a typical presale. It now commands attention with visibility few can rival. BlockDAG’s 2049% Bonus Announcement Before Token2049 At Token2049 Singapore, where narratives decide which projects lead the next cycle, BlockDAG is not waiting quietly. Instead, it has unleashed a 2049% bonus, instantly becoming the most discussed project in the room. While others rely on standard pitches, BlockDAG’s move has flipped the spotlight in its favor. This is more than a temporary marketing push. It is a deliberate strike designed to capture attention, pull in capital, and convert visibility into rapid growth. Token2049 has always been a battleground where credibility is built, and BlockDAG has positioned itself to dominate by timing its headline announcement perfectly. So far, results are undeniable. With more than $388 million raised, 25.5 billion BDAG sold, and a current batch 30 price of $0.03, the project already shows strength. Add to that a 2900% ROI since batch 1, and it’s clear this is not the start of a journey but a sprint into maturity. The 2049% figure is powerful, but the timing matters more. It transforms casual curiosity into immediate participation, securing BlockDAG’s place as one of the most talked-about cryptocurrency presales in 2025. In an industry where credibility is scarce, making such a direct impact is not noise, it is precision. Token2049 provides the global platform, and BlockDAG has already answered with bold execution. Toncoin (TON) Price Forecast for 2025 Toncoin continues to attract volume, now priced at $3.12 with daily trading activity rising to $209 million. That uptick signals rising interest despite a short-term 5% dip. Analysts are closely monitoring as Toncoin approaches the $3.25 support level, which could drive it into the $3.57 to $3.65 zone. Sustained momentum may open the door for further gains. The Toncoin (TON) price forecast for 2025 is optimistic, with potential targets of $6.84 and extended projections as high as $11.34. The wide range highlights both risk and opportunity, requiring traders to stay attentive. With volume building and support zones strengthening, Toncoin shows strong signs of long-term growth potential if technical levels continue to confirm. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Technical Analysis and Price Setup Hyperliquid remains steady near $45.54 after two months of gains, though recent activity suggests consolidation. A slight 0.68% daily drop hasn’t erased its nearly 8% weekly rise, signaling that buying pressure remains. Hyperliquid (HYPE) technical analysis highlights $44.21, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement, as a critical support level. A decline below $42.57 could expose the price to a fall toward $35.42, especially if leveraged trading positions begin to unwind. On the other side, $51 remains the defining resistance. A break above it could send HYPE toward $58, marking a 16% upside potential. Current activity suggests a tense balance between bullish continuation and profit-taking. With whale trades influencing direction, short-term movement could determine whether the next phase is a breakout or retracement. Final Thoughts Toncoin shows resilience with clear growth potential as it tests support, while Hyperliquid’s setup could trigger a breakout if resistance is breached. Both offer traders opportunities to watch closely. But BlockDAG has already pushed ahead of the crowd. Its 2049% bonus launch before Token2049 wasn’t merely a bold statement, it was a perfectly timed strike. With $388 million already secured and momentum accelerating, BlockDAG has positioned itself to dominate the conversation. Timing and presence have turned it into more than a presale, they have redefined the narrative of what’s next. The post Can Toncoin Hit $6.84 or HYPE Reach $51?

According to a chart shared by Dark Defender (@DefendDark), a prominent analyst on X, XRP is progressing through a five-wave impulsive Elliott Wave pattern . He shared a one-day chart highlighting a series of movements that suggest the cryptocurrency may be entering a decisive phase. The chart indicates that the fourth corrective wave has been completed, setting the stage for the fifth and final wave in the sequence. Hi all, I hope all is well. Within the 1-day time frame, XRP follows the 5 Impulsive Elliott Wave structure. The 4th Wave is technically completed. As long as $2.85 is maintained, #XRP is ready for $4.39, the 5th wave. (NFA) Have an excellent Sunday with your loved ones! pic.twitter.com/mbF9wOmbEX — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) August 31, 2025 The Elliott Wave Structure The chart shows that wave 3 peaked when XRP hit an all-time high of $3.65 before consolidating into wave 4, which retraced toward the $2.85 region. This retracement aligns with the 23.6% Fibonacci level, reinforcing its role as a critical support zone. While XRP has yet to recover from the recent decline , this alignment suggests that the asset may have completed its corrective phase and is preparing for renewed upward momentum. The outlined fifth wave target corresponds to a 161.8% Fibonacci extension of the prior impulse, a common measurement used to project Elliott Wave completions. The analysis places particular importance on the $2.85 level, noting it as a key threshold for continuation. As long as XRP holds above this support, the projection for the fifth wave remains intact. The potential target of $4.39 represents the anticipated completion of this wave cycle. In his own words, the analyst stated that “as long as $2.85 is maintained, XRP is ready for $4.39.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Potential Upside While some analysts believe XRP has exhausted its bullish momentum , Dark Defender’s analysis is predicting a 54% increase. Such a move would also push the digital asset above its recent highs, reinforcing the bullish outlook tied to this technical pattern. The magnitude of this potential gain highlights why the $2.85 support zone is so critical. A sustained hold above this level preserves the Elliott Wave framework, while a failure to maintain it could invalidate the projection and suggest further downside. XRP is at a pivotal moment, and consolidating around the crucial $2.85 level. With the fourth wave appearing to have ended and the fifth projected to $4.39, the key remains whether XRP can sustain its footing above the boundary between continuation and reversal.

Last week’s July PCE inflation report did little to shake September rate-cut expectations, as data came in line with expectations, a small increase from previous months. Additionally, the second GDP growth estimate indicated that the economy expanded at a 3.3%, above the initial estimate of 3% growth. President Trump declared on Sunday that “prices are way down in the USA with virtually no inflation,” but consumers are likely to disagree. At the same time, the Kobeissi Letter reported that “US cost of living is getting worse,” highlighting that consumers are taking on increasingly risky debt. Economic Events September 1 to 5 TradFi markets are closed in the United States on Monday for Labor Day, which is fitting as the rest of the week will be dominated by labor market data. The August ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) is due on Tuesday, offering insight into business conditions in the manufacturing sector. PMIs are considered reliable leading indicators for assessing the state of the US economy. Wednesday and Thursday will see July JOLTS jobs data, August ADP non-farm employment data, and initial jobless claims data, all shedding more light on the state of the labor market. These reports are important economic indicators, as the change in the number of positions is strongly associated with the overall health of the economy. The August ISM Services PMI report is due on Thursday, reflecting business conditions in the services sector, which is a major contributor to GDP. The August jobs report will be released to end the week on Friday, rounding off a heavy week for labor data. Key Events This Week: 1. US Markets Closed, Labor Day – Monday 2.

Bitcoin has been leading losses, falling to its lowest level since early July, below $107,500 during Asian trading on Monday morning. The asset is now at its deepest correction point, at more than 13% down from its mid-August peak. Ethereum has declined a similar amount and has fallen below $4,400, but remains within its three-week range-bound channel.

ADA is now consolidating and might extend losses below the $0.80 support. ADA price started a fresh decline below the $0.850 support zone. The price is trading below $0.8320 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.820 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $0.820 resistance zone. Cardano Price Dips Further After a steady increase, Cardano faced sellers near $0.880 and started a downside correction, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA dipped below the $0.850 and $0.8320 support levels. The bears even pushed the price below $0.820. A low was formed at $0.8003 and the price is now consolidating losses.

The first resistance is near $0.8280 or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.8376 swing high to the $0.8003 low. The next key resistance might be $0.840. If there is a close above the $0.840 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.8620 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.880 in the near term. Another Decline In ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.840 resistance level, it could start another decline.

The current Solana price prediction points to steady growth, but its massive market cap limits the upside, with forecasts suggesting only modest gains compared to smaller coins. That is why investors searching for bigger returns are moving toward a new crypto presale that combines meme power with real utility. That brings us to Pepeto(PEPETO), the Ethereum-based meme coin stepping in with tools, staking, and a low entry price, building a case as the next Shiba Inu and even the next millionaire coin. So is this the time to act? Before answering that question, let us break down in detail Solana’s price prediction. Solana Price Prediction Explained, Why Pepeto Could Be the Best Crypto to Buy for 100x Gains Solana (SOL) is still a force in crypto with strong momentum, yet its huge market cap means the upside is limited. Even bullish calls put SOL near 300 to 400 in 2025, or maybe 1,000 long term, which is just 2x to 4x at best. That is steady growth, but far below the explosive multiples smaller tokens can reach. For traders who want percentage gains in months, Solana looks more like a safe large cap hold than the fastest road to life changing returns. To anyone who follows price prediction stories and search for the best crypto to buy, this is the kind of setup that draws early capital looking for the next Shiba Inu style run. Here are simple reasons it stands out next to a giant like SOL, and why some call it the best crypto to buy in a crowded market: • Built on Ethereum mainnet, with PepetoSwap at zero fee, a native cross chain bridge, and dual audits by SolidProof and Coinsult for added confidence. • Staking rewards up to 235%, so holders can earn while they wait for official launch. • Crypto presale access at $0.000000150, a tiny entry price that supports clear price prediction scenarios. • Community first design, 100k plus followers already, with tokenomics that back growth, 420 trillion total supply, 30 percent Presale, 30 percent Staking, 20 percent Marketing, 12.5 percent Liquidity, 7.5 percent Development. The Mainnet Tools and a Home Memecoins Deserve Pepeto is an Ethereum memecoin built on mainnet, not Layer 2, engineered for smooth use with real utility. It brings a zero fee Exchange called PepetoSwap, plus a native cross chain bridge, so traders can move and trade with simple flows. Where many meme ecosystems slow down or add costs at busy times, Pepeto focuses on speed, clarity, and scale. It aims to keep activity easy for everyday users while giving serious holders the structure they want. Why Pepeto Steals The Spotlight From Solana (SOL) Even while Solana rise and traders talk about old highs, smart money is moving to where the real multiples can be made. Pepeto is that chance, a low entry Ethereum memecoin that powers its own zero fee swap, creating real demand every time people trade. Reports already show that many of the same investors who spotted Shiba early are now putting money into Pepeto, and they know better than anyone where the next big wave can come from. With culture, utility, and timing all aligned, this presale is being called a once-in-a-cycle chance to turn small buys into life changing returns. Price potential of 50x to 100x by 2025, and even higher by 2026 and 2030 if adoption compounds, is why Pepeto is the coin investors do not want to miss. Step by Step Guide to Pepeto Presale, The Best Crypto to Buy Now Getting started with Pepeto is simple, and the chance is live right now. Create a wallet like Metamask, load it with ETH, USDT, or BNB, and connect it to the official website: https://pepeto.io/#how-to-buy From there, you can buy $PEPETO at the presale price of $0.000000150 and even stake instantly for max gains. Over $6,554,000 has already been raised, the token powers PepetoSwap with zero fees, and audits are complete with SolidProof and Coinsult. The process takes only a few clicks, and every early buyer is stepping into what many believe could be the best crypto to buy before the next crypto Bull run. Move Early To Capture The Biggest Gains Pepeto is not just built for this cycle, it is built to change lives. It is the Ethereum memecoin that powers its own zero fee swap, drives demand every time users trade, and gives holders a chance to earn while they wait. This is how the future of meme coins looks, culture on the surface, real infrastructure underneath. Many who spotted Shiba early are already here, because they know the right decision at the right moment is what makes fortunes in crypto. The opportunity now is in Pepeto, and the window is open. Are you going to let it pass, or will you step in before the next move writes the millionaire stories of tomorrow?

This suggests a 2x to 4x move at best, which is steady but limited compared to small-cap tokens. Why do investors call Pepeto the best crypto to buy now?: Pepeto combines meme culture with real tools, a zero fee swap, a native cross chain bridge, staking up to 235%, and dual audits. Its small base gives it far higher growth potential. How do I buy Pepeto during the presale?: Create a wallet like MetaMask, fund it with ETH, USDT, or BNB, connect at pepeto.io, choose the amount, buy, and stake instantly. Is Pepeto audited and a safe investment?: Yes, Pepeto has been audited by SolidProof and Coinsult, and its tokenomics are transparent, with 30% Presale, 30% Staking, 20% Marketing, 12.5% Liquidity, and 7.5% Development.",Press Release,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|TRADING|ETH|ZRX,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-01 05:15:00

The company said the latest purchase cost an average of 16.33m yen per coin, or about $111,000, for a total of 16.48b yen ($112m). At today’s market price of $107,407, the acquisition is valued at about $108.6m. This latest buy pushes Metaplanet’s aggregate Bitcoin holdings to 302.3b yen, or roughly $2.14b. The company’s average purchase price across all holdings now stands at 15.1m yen per Bitcoin, equal to about $102,800. Metaplanet Reports BTC Yield Of 30.7% For Latest Quarter Metaplanet has accelerated its Bitcoin accumulation throughout 2025, ramping up from just over 13,000 BTC at the end of June to 20,000 by Sept. 1. The company made multiple acquisitions in July and August, with purchases funded through capital market activities and operating income. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,009 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 20,000 BTC* pic.twitter.com/kwvUkQaFth — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) September 1, 2025 The latest announcement also details the firm’s performance metrics. Metaplanet reported a BTC Yield of 30.7% for the quarter through Sept. 1, a measure it uses to track Bitcoin holdings relative to fully diluted shares. In earlier quarters this year, BTC Yield soared as high as 309.8%, reflecting the company’s aggressive strategy. Management said BTC Yield, BTC Gain and BTC ¥ Gain are not traditional financial indicators but internal measures to assess whether Bitcoin purchases are accretive to shareholders. Eric Trump To Attend Shareholder Meeting In Tokyo On Monday Metaplanet formally adopted Bitcoin treasury operations as a core business in Dec. 2024. Since then, the company has raised capital and converted proceeds into Bitcoin. The company’s aggressive approach has drawn comparisons to MicroStrategy in the US, which also turned Bitcoin into its primary reserve asset. Both firms argue that holding the cryptocurrency provides a hedge against inflation and dilution. Meanwhile, the Trump family’s involvement has added international attention. In March, Metaplanet appointed Eric Trump as an advisor , saying his role would help accelerate Bitcoin adoption. He is scheduled to attend a Metaplanet shareholder meeting in Tokyo on Monday, marking a further step in the family’s push into digital assets. The Trumps have spent the past year expanding into crypto ventures, ranging from stablecoins to mining. Their presence at Metaplanet signals a bid to globalize the brand while aligning with a Japanese firm that has become a symbol of Bitcoin-focused corporate strategy.

Analysts warn the collapse of its “Bitcoin premium” from 8x to 2x heightens dilution risks, though Metaplanet’s recent upgrade to FTSE Japan’s mid-cap index offers somewhat of a silver lining. Metaplanet Faces Pressure Metaplanet, the Tokyo-listed firm known for its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation, is facing some financial strain as its share price continues to tumble. The company’s stock plunged by more than 50% since mid-June, even as Bitcoin was able to gain around 2% over the same period. Metaplanet’s stock price over the past month (Source: Google Finance ) The sharp decline undermined Metaplanet’s capital-raising “flywheel” strategy, which relies on rising stock prices to unlock funding through MS warrants issued to Evo Fund, its key investor. With the current share price drop, exercising these warrants became unattractive for Evo, tightening Metaplanet’s liquidity and slowing down its Bitcoin acquisition drive. Metaplanet is led by former Goldman Sachs trader Simon Gerovich, and it amassed 18,991 BTC. This makes it the seventh-largest public Bitcoin holder according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET . The company also set ambitious targets of holding 100,000 BTC by 2026 and 210,000 BTC by 2027. But with its existing strategy faltering, Gerovich is now looking for alternative funding sources. Top public Bitcoin treasury companies (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) Last week, Metaplanet announced plans to raise roughly 130.3 billion yen ($880 million) through a public share offering in overseas markets. In addition, shareholders will vote on whether to approve the issuance of up to 555 million preferred shares, which could raise as much as 555 billion yen ($3.7 billion). Gerovich described the preferred shares as a defensive mechanism, offering capital without diluting common shareholders if the stock falls even more. The preferred stock is expected to carry up to 6% annual dividends and is initially capped at 25% of Metaplanet’s Bitcoin holdings, which may prove appealing to yield-hungry Japanese investors. Despite these efforts, analysts warn that the success of Metaplanet’s strategy hinges on the “Bitcoin premium”—which is the difference between its market capitalization and the value of its Bitcoin holdings. That premium collapsed from over 8x in June to just 2x, raising concerns about future dilution. The company already suspended Evo’s warrant exercises for most of September to facilitate the preferred share issuance. Whether this pivot will restore momentum to its funding model remains to be seen. Nonetheless, Metaplanet earned an upgrade from small-cap to mid-cap status in FTSE Russell’s September Semi-Annual Review, securing inclusion in the FTSE Japan Index after its strong second-quarter performance.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-01 05:30:00

Strong demand for semiconductors and autos helped keep trade steady in August. According to customs data, South Korea’s exports edged up 1.3% in August from the corresponding period last year, moderating from July’s sharp 5.8% increase. On a working-day adjusted basis, shipments grew 5.8% once again. Imports, however, fell 4%, pushing the trade balance to a $6.5 billion surplus. The Bank of Korea warns that tariffs could affect the country’s exports to the US August export gains have provided a measure of relief to the economy. Even so, the export momentum may falter once front-loaded deliveries subside and semiconductor tariffs come into play. Korean manufacturers narrowly avoided the harshest possible outcome in late July, when an agreement with Washington defused Trump’s threat of a 25% tariff . However, the agreed-upon 15% levy still marks a break from the long-standing tariff-free framework of the trade pact. The central bank even cautioned recently that the tariffs would weigh on multiple fronts—from trade to financial markets to business confidence. Exports to the US, it added, could face the steepest losses as cost pressures mount and demand cools. According to Governor Rhee Chang Yong, export numbers were better than anticipated even as US duties rose, with semiconductors and autos leading the way, and ultimately that helped push this year’s GDP prediction up by 0.2%. However, Rhee also cautioned that the negative effects of tariffs may become more severe in future years. Nevertheless, the outlook for long-term growth in 2026 remained unchanged at 1.6%. On Thursday, Rhee also commented, “While there are concerns about chip tariffs, the current upturn in the semiconductor cycle is lasting longer than we expected. If exports remain strong, it could provide additional upside for the economy.” South Korea considers increased spending in 2026, especially for its defense budget The Bank of Korea recently opted to keep its policy rate steady at 2.5%, saying it needed time to analyse whether imbalances in housing, credit, and currency markets were under control before resuming monetary easing. Its decision, however, was widely expected, with 22 of 23 economists in a Bloomberg survey predicting no change. As reported by Cryptopolitan, p olicymakers also raised their 2025 growth forecast slightly to 0.9% from 0.8%, marking the slowest pace since 2020. At the same time, they lifted their inflation outlook to 2%, up from 1.9% in May. The central bank noted that inflation remains contained and the economy has shown modest growth. However, it warned that soaring housing prices in Seoul and rising household debt warrant close attention. Debt concerns have deepened following four rate cuts since last year, while uncertainty over US tariffs weighs on South Korea’s export-driven economy. Nonetheless, officials plan to roll out a significantly larger annual budget to support an economy squeezed by US tariffs, rising social spending, and demographic headwinds from an aging society and record-low birth rates. On Friday, South Korea’s finance ministry said that President Lee Jae Myung’s administration has suggested a 2026 budget of 728 trillion won, equal to about $522 billion, representing an 8.1% rise from this year, excluding extra outlays. The increase, driven partly by defense spending, far exceeds the 2.5% expansion in 2025. A finance ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also claimed South Korea aims to issue a record 232 trillion won ($167 billion) of bonds in 2026 to cover government expenditures. At a cabinet meeting on Friday, President Lee confirmed plans of budget expansion, stating, “Now is a time when an active fiscal role is needed more than ever.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Will the bull run continue, or are we on the brink of a significant reversal? This critical price level has captured the attention of analysts, signaling a make-or-break moment for the digital asset. Investors are keenly watching, understanding that the decisions made in the coming weeks could shape Bitcoin’s trajectory for the foreseeable future. What Makes Bitcoin’s $108K Juncture So Significant? According to a recent market report from the respected crypto analytics firm 10x Research, Bitcoin trading around the $108,000 mark is far more than just another price point. It represents a critical juncture that could define its trajectory for months to come. The firm highlighted that the price action over the next two weeks will be decisive, setting the stage for either continued growth or a bearish shift. This isn’t merely a speculative claim; it’s based on observable market behaviors. Several key factors contribute to this heightened tension and underscore the importance of Bitcoin’s $108K juncture : Long-Term Holder Distribution: Analysts observe that long-term holders are beginning to distribute their supply. Historically, this can signal a potential peak or a shift in market sentiment as seasoned investors take profits. ETF Inflows Stagnation: Inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are showing signs of stagnation. This suggests a slowdown in the fresh institutional demand that often fuels significant price rallies. A lack of new capital from these major players can dampen upward momentum. Rising Volatility: Market volatility appears to be on the rise, making price movements more unpredictable and increasing the risk for short-term traders. Increased volatility often precedes significant price swings, in either direction. External Pressures and Market Risks at Play Beyond internal market mechanics, external macroeconomic factors are also poised to significantly influence Bitcoin’s $108K juncture . The upcoming U.S. labor market data and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision, specifically on September 17, are major events on the global economic calendar. These announcements have a track record of impacting traditional financial markets, and by extension, the cryptocurrency space. These decisions could introduce substantial volatility into the market. For instance, an unexpected hawkish stance from the Fed or concerning labor data could trigger a broader risk-off sentiment, leading investors to pull back from riskier assets like Bitcoin. Conversely, a more dovish outlook could provide a much-needed boost. A persistent lack of new capital inflows remains a critical risk factor, potentially hindering any upward momentum Bitcoin might otherwise generate. Therefore, investors are closely watching these macroeconomic developments, understanding their potential to act as powerful catalysts. Are Technicals and On-Chain Data Offering Clarity for Bitcoin’s $108K Juncture? Interestingly, 10x Research also pointed out that major on-chain support levels and traditional technical indicators are not providing a clear directional bias at this moment. This lack of a definitive signal from typically reliable metrics adds another layer of complexity to the current market situation. Usually, strong support or resistance levels can offer clues about future price movements, but their ambiguity now suggests profound market indecision. As a result, the firm concluded that the risk associated with Bitcoin investing is higher than ever. This period will undoubtedly serve as a crucial test, distinguishing professional investors who possess the experience and analytical tools to navigate uncertainty from amateur investors who might struggle with the elevated risk. Understanding these nuances is absolutely essential for making informed decisions during this period of heightened uncertainty and potential market shifts. Navigating the Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Investors Given the high stakes at Bitcoin’s $108K juncture , investors should consider adopting a strategic and disciplined approach. This is not a time for impulsive decisions, but rather for careful planning and execution. Here are some actionable insights to help navigate the current market landscape: Prioritize Robust Risk Management: Always invest only what you can comfortably afford to lose. Volatility demands careful position sizing and the setting of clear stop-loss orders to protect capital. Stay Diligently Informed: Keep a close eye on macroeconomic data, especially the upcoming Fed decisions and labor reports. These external factors can often override internal crypto market dynamics. Analyze Market Flow and On-Chain Metrics: Continuously monitor ETF inflows and on-chain metrics for any significant shifts in long-term holder behavior or new institutional interest. These indicators can provide early warnings or confirm trends. Cultivate Emotional Discipline: In times of high uncertainty and rapid price swings, emotional trading can lead to poor outcomes. Stick rigorously to a well-researched investment plan and avoid making snap decisions based on fear or greed. This period isn’t just a challenge; it’s an opportunity for experienced investors to demonstrate their resilience, analytical prowess, and disciplined approach to market fluctuations. Successfully navigating this critical phase could yield significant lessons and potential rewards. The current situation with Bitcoin’s $108K juncture truly represents a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency. With market fundamentals shifting, external economic pressures mounting, and technical indicators offering no clear path, the next few weeks will be critical. This period will undoubtedly test the resolve and analytical skills of every investor, underscoring the importance of informed, strategic decision-making in a volatile market. As the market stands at this crossroads, only time will tell which path Bitcoin ultimately takes. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What makes $108K a critical level for Bitcoin? According to 10x Research, Bitcoin trading around $108,000 is a critical juncture because the price action over the next two weeks could decisively determine whether its bull run continues or a bearish reversal begins, influenced by several market and macroeconomic factors. 2. How do macroeconomic factors like Fed decisions impact Bitcoin’s price? Major macroeconomic events, such as U.S. labor market data and Federal Reserve interest rate decisions, can introduce significant volatility. They influence broader market sentiment, potentially causing investors to shift capital between risk-on assets like Bitcoin and safer havens. 3. What does “long-term holder distribution” mean for Bitcoin? Long-term holder distribution refers to seasoned investors, who typically hold Bitcoin for extended periods, beginning to sell off their assets.

Currently, the Asia FX landscape and the US Dollar are experiencing a period of relative quiet, a calm before what many anticipate could be a significant storm or a gentle breeze, depending on how global central banks steer their monetary policy. This subdued activity is largely attributed to market participants carefully weighing the probability and timing of Fed easing bets , alongside a close watch on crucial regional PMI data . Let’s explore the forces at play in the global Forex market and what they mean for your financial outlook. Unpacking the Subdued Dynamics of Asia FX and the US Dollar When we talk about a “subdued” market, we are referring to a period of lower volatility, tighter trading ranges, and a general lack of strong directional movement for currencies. Both the Asia FX complex and the US Dollar have been trading within relatively narrow bands, reflecting a cautious stance among investors. But what drives this quietude? For Asia FX , the subdued environment often stems from a mix of factors: Regional Economic Performance: Asian economies are highly integrated into global supply chains. Their performance is closely tied to international trade and demand. Mixed signals from major trading partners can lead to hesitation. Local Central Bank Policies: Central banks across Asia are navigating their own inflation and growth challenges. Their policy decisions, while influential locally, can sometimes offset each other on a broader scale, contributing to overall market equilibrium. Trade Balances: While some Asian nations maintain strong export surpluses, global trade uncertainties can dampen enthusiasm for their currencies. The US Dollar , as the world’s primary reserve currency and a traditional safe haven, often sees its movements dictated by global risk sentiment and interest rate differentials. Its current subdued state can be attributed to several ongoing narratives: Inflation Concerns: While inflation has cooled from its peak, it remains a persistent concern for policymakers. The path forward for inflation will heavily influence the Federal Reserve’s actions. Growth Outlook: Economic growth forecasts for the U.S. and globally are constantly being revised. Uncertainty about the strength of future growth can keep the dollar in check. Geopolitical Events: Ongoing geopolitical tensions, while not directly causing dollar strength or weakness, can create an environment of caution that prevents significant directional moves. This period of calm in the broader Forex market is not necessarily a sign of stability, but rather an indication that traders are awaiting clearer signals before committing to major positions. It’s a moment where every piece of economic data and every central bank utterance is scrutinized for clues about the future. The Critical Influence of Fed Easing Bets on Global Currencies Perhaps the single most significant factor currently influencing currency markets is the ongoing speculation surrounding Fed easing bets . But what exactly are these bets, and why do they hold such sway over the US Dollar and, by extension, global currencies like Asia FX ? What are Fed Easing Bets? “Fed easing bets” refer to market participants’ expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will reduce its benchmark interest rate (the federal funds rate) or implement other accommodative monetary policies, such as quantitative easing. These expectations are driven by a continuous assessment of economic data, inflation trends, and the Fed’s own communications. Why are They So Significant? The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions have profound implications: Interest Rate Differentials: Lower U.S. interest rates make dollar-denominated assets less attractive compared to assets in countries with higher rates. This can lead to capital outflow from the U.S., weakening the dollar. Cost of Borrowing: The federal funds rate influences borrowing costs across the U.S. economy. Lower rates aim to stimulate investment and consumption. Global Liquidity: A looser Fed policy can inject more liquidity into the global financial system, potentially benefiting riskier assets worldwide. How Do Fed Easing Bets Impact the US Dollar? When traders anticipate the Federal Reserve will implement ‘easing’ measures—primarily through interest rate cuts—it signals a potential shift in monetary policy. Interest rate cuts reduce the cost of borrowing for commercial banks, aiming to stimulate economic activity. For the US Dollar , lower interest rates typically diminish its attractiveness to international investors seeking higher yields. This reduction in demand can lead to a weakening of the dollar against other major currencies. Conversely, if the Fed maintains a hawkish stance, keeping rates high or signaling future hikes, the dollar tends to strengthen as it offers a superior return on investment compared to currencies from economies with lower rates. These Fed easing bets are therefore a central driver of dollar valuation, influencing everything from global trade costs to commodity prices and, crucially, capital flows across the Forex market . Impact on Asia FX: A weakening US Dollar , driven by Fed easing bets , often provides a tailwind for Asia FX . When the dollar loses its yield advantage, investors may seek higher returns in emerging markets, leading to capital inflows into Asian economies. This increased demand for Asian assets can strengthen local currencies. Conversely, a strong dollar can draw capital away from Asia, putting downward pressure on regional currencies. The interplay is complex, with local economic fundamentals also playing a significant role. What Does PMI Data Reveal for the Forex Market? Beyond central bank pronouncements, economic indicators provide crucial insights into the health of an economy. Among the most closely watched are Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) reports. But what is PMI data , and why is it so vital for understanding the Forex market ? Understanding PMI Data The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) is an economic indicator derived from monthly surveys of private sector companies. It provides an early insight into the current and future business conditions to purchasing managers. There are two main types: Manufacturing PMI and Services PMI. Key components typically include: New Orders: A measure of demand. Output/Production: Current activity levels. Employment: Hiring or firing trends. Supplier Deliveries: Indicating supply chain pressures. Inventories: Stock levels of finished goods and inputs. Significance as a Leading Indicator: PMI is considered a leading economic indicator because purchasing managers are often the first to see changes in demand (new orders) and supply conditions. A reading above 50 generally indicates expansion in the sector compared to the previous month, while a reading below 50 suggests contraction. The further the deviation from 50, the stronger the change. How Regional PMI Data Influences Asia FX and the Forex Market: For Asia FX , regional PMI data from economic powerhouses like China, Japan, South Korea, and the ASEAN bloc is particularly impactful. Strong PMI figures signal robust economic activity, which can attract foreign investment and strengthen local currencies. Conversely, weak PMI readings can signal an economic slowdown, deterring investment and potentially weakening currencies. For example: China’s PMI: Given China’s role as a global manufacturing hub and major trading partner for many Asian nations, its PMI data is closely watched. A strong Chinese manufacturing PMI can boost sentiment for other Asian currencies that supply raw materials or components to China. Japan’s PMI: As a major developed economy in Asia, Japan’s PMI reflects its domestic demand and export health, influencing the Japanese Yen and broader regional sentiment. ASEAN PMIs: Data from countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand provides insights into the health of emerging Asian economies, affecting their respective currencies. The collective impact of this PMI data provides a comprehensive picture of global economic health, guiding capital flows and influencing the valuation of the US Dollar against a basket of currencies, as well as shaping expectations for central bank actions. For instance, consistently strong PMI data might reduce the likelihood of Fed easing bets , leading to a stronger dollar, while weak global PMI could increase those bets. Here’s a simplified look at how PMI data can affect currency sentiment: PMI Reading Economic Signal Potential Currency Impact (General) Above 50 (Stronger) Economic Expansion, Healthy Demand Currency strengthens (attracts investment, reduces easing bets) Below 50 (Weaker) Economic Contraction, Weak Demand Currency weakens (deters investment, increases easing bets) Unexpectedly High Stronger-than-expected growth Sharp currency appreciation Unexpectedly Low Weaker-than-expected growth Sharp currency depreciation Navigating the Complexities of the Global Forex Market The global Forex market is a vast and intricate ecosystem, where billions of dollars are traded daily. For both seasoned traders and those new to the space, navigating its complexities requires a keen understanding of macroeconomics, central bank policies, and geopolitical landscapes. The current environment, characterized by subdued Asia FX and US Dollar movements, is a testament to this complexity, as market participants patiently await clearer signals. What are the Challenges for Traders? Volatility Surges: While currently subdued, the market can quickly become volatile on unexpected news, leading to rapid price swings. Central Bank Divergence: Different central banks pursue varying monetary policies based on their unique economic conditions, creating a complex web of interest rate differentials. Geopolitical Risks: International conflicts, trade disputes, and political instability can dramatically shift sentiment and capital flows, impacting currency valuations. Data Interpretation: Economic data, including PMI data , can sometimes be contradictory or subject to revision, making it challenging to form a clear picture. What Opportunities Exist in This Environment? Even in a subdued market, opportunities arise for those who are prepared: Range Trading: In periods of low volatility, currencies may trade within established ranges, offering opportunities for range-bound strategies. Anticipating Breakouts: By closely monitoring key indicators and central bank rhetoric, traders can position themselves for potential breakouts once clearer signals emerge regarding Fed easing bets or economic trajectories. Hedging Strategies: Businesses and investors with international exposure can use the Forex market to hedge against currency fluctuations, protecting their assets from adverse movements in the US Dollar or Asia FX . Actionable Insights for Informed Decisions: Monitor Central Bank Communications: Pay close attention to speeches, minutes, and press conferences from the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, and other major central banks. These provide direct insights into their policy intentions. Track Key Economic Indicators: Beyond PMI data , keep an eye on inflation reports (CPI, PPI), employment figures (NFP), GDP growth, and retail sales. These paint a broader picture of economic health. Understand Intermarket Correlations: Recognize how currencies interact with other asset classes like bonds, commodities (especially oil and gold), and equities. For instance, a stronger US Dollar often has an inverse relationship with commodity prices. Implement Robust Risk Management: Given the inherent unpredictability of the Forex market , always use stop-loss orders and manage your position sizes appropriately to protect your capital. The Interconnectedness: From Forex to Crypto Markets For those deeply entrenched in the cryptocurrency space, it might seem like a world apart from traditional Forex market dynamics. However, the reality is that these two realms are increasingly interconnected. Macroeconomic trends, central bank policies, and global liquidity conditions, which profoundly influence the US Dollar and Asia FX , also cast a long shadow over digital assets. How Fed Easing Bets Ripple into Crypto: When Fed easing bets intensify, suggesting lower interest rates and a potentially weaker US Dollar , the narrative for risk assets often shifts positively. Lower interest rates can make traditional safe-haven investments like bonds less attractive, pushing investors towards higher-yielding or growth-oriented assets. Cryptocurrencies, often viewed as risk-on assets, can benefit from this increased appetite for risk. A weaker dollar also means more global liquidity, which can flow into various asset classes, including crypto, boosting valuations and trading volumes. Asia FX and Regional Crypto Adoption: The health and stability of Asia FX markets directly impact regional liquidity and investor sentiment. Stronger Asian economies, reflected in robust PMI data and stable currencies, can foster greater confidence among local investors, potentially leading to increased participation in cryptocurrency markets. Conversely, currency weakness or economic uncertainty in Asia might prompt investors to seek alternative stores of value, sometimes including cryptocurrencies, or could lead to capital flight, affecting crypto valuations. Global Forex Market Stability and Crypto Confidence: Overall stability or instability in the traditional Forex market sets the backdrop for all financial assets. A stable macro environment, where currency movements are predictable and central bank policies are clear, generally fosters greater confidence across the financial spectrum, including crypto. Conversely, periods of high volatility or uncertainty in traditional currencies can either lead to a flight to safety (potentially to established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in some scenarios) or a broad risk-off sentiment that impacts all speculative assets. Understanding these connections is not just academic; it’s crucial for making informed decisions in the fast-evolving digital asset landscape. Monitoring the Federal Reserve’s stance, analyzing global economic indicators, and observing the movements of major currencies like the US Dollar and key Asia FX pairs can provide valuable context for anticipating shifts in cryptocurrency market sentiment and liquidity. Conclusion: Navigating the Tides of Global Finance The current subdued state of Asia FX and the US Dollar is a clear reflection of a global financial landscape holding its breath. Traders and investors are meticulously weighing the potential for Fed easing bets , a factor that promises to reshape interest rate differentials and capital flows worldwide. Simultaneously, the continuous stream of regional PMI data offers vital clues about the underlying health and trajectory of economies, acting as a crucial barometer for future market movements. The interplay of these powerful forces means the Forex market remains a complex, yet incredibly insightful, arena. Staying informed about these macro trends is not just for currency traders; it’s essential for anyone seeking to understand the broader economic currents that ultimately impact all financial assets, including the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies. As we move forward, vigilance and a deep understanding of these drivers will be your most valuable tools.

EETH underperforms spot ETFs on price but stands out with a 6%+ yield, making it attractive for income-focused investors despite higher fees. Risks include crypto market volatility, historical cycle peaks, and persistent Bitcoin dominance, tempering my bullishness with caution. Ethereum’s expanding use cases in DeFi and AI, plus likely Fed rate cuts, strengthen my conviction in EETH’s upside with a $98 price target. After gaining more than 100% since the first week of April, the ProShares Ether ETF ( EETH ) was trading at around $76.8 at the time of writing but remains below its March 2024 high of $91. Data by YCharts This thesis aims to show that this rally could continue, given that we could be amid a potential rotation from Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) to Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). For this purpose, while also highlighting the risks, I will examine how whales (individuals, funds, or institutions that hold very significant amounts of crypto) are positioning themselves and look at crypto flows on the derivatives market. Equally important, this ETF yields above 6%, which makes sense from the income perspective since there is a strong likelihood (nearly 90% chance) of the Federal Reserve cutting rates next month. I start with crypto price action. Supporting a Rotation First, looking at the price performance since April in the orange chart below, Ether surged to hit a new all-time high of $4,946, while Bitcoin has been struggling to hold above $110K after its gains. This is despite the enactment of the GENIUS Act, which, despite primarily focusing on regulating stablecoins, can also increase the adoption of other digital assets, including Bitcoin. This situation has led one analyst to note that ""BTC is exhausted "". Data by YCharts Second, derivatives activity on the CME also points to surging interest in Ether. Thus, derivatives open interest (or Ether futures volume) reached $10.54 billion on June 30, representing a 58.65% quarter-over-quarter increase, outpacing Bitcoin futures, which grew by 34.92% to $16.85 billion. This reflects heightened institutional interest in ETH, for hedging purposes and at a time when its supply has decreased. In this connection, Ether's reserves on Binance, one of the major crypto exchanges, have dropped significantly, possibly because investors are buying more in anticipation of a price recovery or for long-term holding (staking). This could also signal the onset of the Altcoin season, synonymous with a reallocation of capital from Bitcoin to other coins, including Ether. Looking further, a rotation thesis is also supported by some major on-chain moves that involve Bitcoin whales executing massive conversions from BTC to ETH at the blockchain level. Hence, one dormant whale converted 19,663 BTC (market value of $2.22 billion) into 455,672 ETH, while another one liquidated 400 BTC ($45.5 million), again to acquire Ether. Based on the above, it makes strong sense to invest in Ether, but some may argue why choose a futures tool like EETH while several cheaper alternatives like spot ETFs are available. EETH Underperforms Spot ETF Price-Wise, But Differentiates Itself Through Income First, detailing EETH, this is an actively managed ETF that seeks to provide investment results corresponding to the performance of Ether by investing primarily in futures contracts. To achieve its aim of continuously trading contracts, it charges a relatively high expense ratio of 0.95% , which includes a contractual waiver until September 30, 2025, after which it may revert to 1.00% . Here, the problem is that spot Ethereum ETFs have engaged in a fee war, with many charging significantly lower, as exemplified by the highly popular iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHA ), with an expense ratio of 0.25%, as shown in the comparison below . Seeking Alpha This means EETH faces low-cost competition from spot ETFs, which also offer better tracking accuracy (or more accurately replicate the underlying asset), accounting for ETHA's much better price performance as shown above. The reason is that futures-based ETFs tend to underperform the crypto itself because of roll costs, expense ratio drag, and contango, a market scenario where a commodity's future delivery price is higher than its current spot price. Moreover, lower fees and better price performance have favorably positioned spot ETFs for Ether exposure in the ETF space, with ETHA having garnered over $16 billion in assets under management in 14 months, compared to only $137 million for EETH, which was incepted earlier. Hence, in a market where most are flocking to spot ETFs to obtain better price appreciation, I believe EETH has more of a niche status in the sense that it prioritizes income over performance, namely its dividend yield of around 6.08% TTM, paid monthly. In this connection, unlike spot ETF, CME Ether futures are cash-settled, and ProShares’ active management generates distributable income monthly. Noteworthily, the expense ratio of 0.95% may appear relatively high but is largely offset by its above-6% yield, which, it must be emphasized, is net of expenses. Thus, according to the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), distribution yields are reported after fund operating expenses . Equally important, as I detail below, EETH's yield, which dwarfs the median for all ETFs by a whopping 140% , is appealing to income seekers, especially in the current macro context, with the Fed likely to shift to easing, making bond yields fall. Additionally, the ProShares fund also offers price appreciation potential from its futures exposure, meaning it deserves better. The Futures ETF Deserves Better, But There Are Risks Talking valuations, according to the chart below , it has delivered an upside of 51.5% compared to 76.7% for ETHA in the past year. Interestingly, the tracking gap highlighted, or 51.5% versus 76.7%, or 76.7/51.5, represents about a 50% capture ratio of Ether's upside (since ETHA tracks Ether). Seeking Alpha Now, the crypto was trading around $4,456 at the time of writing, and one top analyst expects it to go to above $12,000 by the end of this year, or by about 169%. This is a highly bullish forecast, and applying a high dose of moderation, let’s assume an appreciation of around 56% (one-third of 169%) to $5,940 in the medium term. Applying the capture ratio of 50% of Ether’s upside as identified earlier, EETH could appreciate by 28% (50 x 56/100), which gives a price target of $98.3 (76.8 x 1.45) based on the current share price of $76.8. Now, to justify my moderate stance, there are challenges associated with the rotation thesis, as despite being supported by recent trends, EETH faces potential headwinds from market volatility and broader economic conditions. This includes sharp price corrections, like Ethereum's 8.2% decline in a single day on August 25 , which highlights the volatility that can disrupt rotation trends. Moreover, looking at historical trends, Ether's all-time highs have often coincided with broader crypto market tops, as charted below in 2018 and 2021 (two times). In those cycles, ETH's breakout relative to BTC was followed by a broader crypto market peak, eventually followed by a slide . Data by YCharts Thus, based on the historical data, there are reasons to worry that the current cycle could follow previous trends, with Ether potentially reaching a market top rather than a sustained rotation. Furthermore, looking at Bitcoin's dominance, or its relative market share (capitalization) in the overall crypto market, despite recent declines, remains elevated at around 58.3% . Also, technical indicators, such as the Moving Average , suggest that while the short-to-medium momentum is weak (price situated below the 10-day, 50-day, and 100-day MAs), the long-term trend is still bullish (price above the 200-day MA). Hence, despite short-term pressure, BTC remains in a long-term uptrend. Confirming the Bullish Case for EETH Now, despite these risks, I remain bullish due to Ethereum's role in innovation, namely, decentralized finance and AI, as well as rate cuts supporting the income rationale, both of which support the rotation away from Bitcoin. First, Bitcoin’s value is primarily driven by its role as a store of value, meaning it is prized for its scarcity and also adopted as a hedge against inflation. In contrast, Ethereum’s value is also determined by its status as a blockchain platform for application development, implying it should also be valued by usage, or the network activity created by its supporting role in decentralized applications, like DeFi (decentralized finance) protocols, NFTs (non-fungible tokens), and increasingly, AI-powered smart contracts (intelligent apps integrated into blockchains). Now, AI and Ether convergence, potentially leading to the emergence of autonomous AI agents (agentic AI) for transactions and settling payments, could become a key differentiator with BTC as blockchain adoption grows. Talking risk mitigation, these expanding Ethereum use cases could help to shield its price from market volatility as its value becomes less associated with investor sentiment (like whales buying or selling), as is the case for BTC. Second, as the Fed lowers interest rates, EETH's passive income stream becomes particularly attractive. To this end, the chart below shows that when the U.S. Central Bank aggressively cut rates to zero following the COVID pandemic, as from March 2020, Ether outperformed Bitcoin. Conversely, it underperformed when rates were frantically raised in mid-2022 to contain inflation. Seeking Alpha Then, logically, if monetary policy is further loosened, one can expect more BTC-to-ETH conversions. In conclusion, this thesis has painted a bullish picture for EETH, whose shares could rise to $98, or $7 above its 2024 peak. Some may view this as an unambitious target given the strong case made for the rotation to Ether, but this includes moderation, mainly due to the rotation not proceeding smoothly and the futures strategy's tracking inefficiency. Also, one must not ignore that inflation may raise its ugly head because of the effects of tariffs, while there is a high level of uncertainty concerning administration policies, exacerbated by the extraordinary political pressure put on the Fed. Still, the aggressive lowering of rates remains a priority of the current U.S. administration in its attempt to increase spending and raise the GDP growth rate. In these circumstances, the capital flows from Bitcoin to Ether should be sustained over the long term, but amid risk-off episodes that may negatively impact crypto markets broadly. .",ETH-USD|ETHA|EETH,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|ETH,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-01 05:45:57

Recently, the crypto community buzzed with news of a prominent Bitcoin OG making an astonishing transaction. This early investor, known for their long-standing presence and substantial holdings, executed a remarkable trade, further diversifying their portfolio towards Ethereum. This isn’t just another trade; it’s a statement, reflecting a strategic outlook on the evolving digital asset landscape. Who is This Mysterious Bitcoin OG? An individual or entity often referred to as a Bitcoin OG (Original Gangster) is an early adopter and investor in Bitcoin. These are the pioneers who recognized Bitcoin’s potential long before it became mainstream. Their actions are closely watched because they represent deep experience and often possess a unique understanding of market cycles and long-term value propositions. The latest move by this particular Bitcoin OG involved a substantial sale of BTC. According to reports from blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, this investor sold an additional 2,000 BTC. This significant transaction was executed over a four-hour period, during which they acquired an impressive 48,942 ETH. The total value of these transactions? A staggering $215 million. This massive exchange took place on Hyperliquid (HYPE), a decentralized exchange, highlighting a preference for DeFi platforms for large-scale operations. Why Such a Significant BTC to ETH Conversion? The decision by a seasoned Bitcoin OG to convert such a large sum from Bitcoin to Ethereum raises compelling questions about their investment thesis. While Bitcoin remains the undisputed king of cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum’s ecosystem continues to grow at an exponential rate. Here are a few potential reasons for this strategic pivot: Diversification: Even the most ardent Bitcoin maximalists often recognize the benefits of a diversified portfolio. Ethereum, with its robust smart contract platform, DeFi ecosystem, and NFT market, offers a different risk-reward profile. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum’s utility extends far beyond a store of value. It powers thousands of decentralized applications (dApps), stablecoins, and innovative financial instruments. An investor might see greater growth potential in ETH’s functional utility. Anticipation of Future Upgrades: Ethereum’s ongoing development, particularly with the upcoming ‘Surge’ and ‘Scourge’ phases, aims to enhance scalability, security, and sustainability. These upgrades could significantly boost ETH’s value proposition. Long-Term Vision: For an early investor, a move of this magnitude likely reflects a long-term strategic vision, positioning for what they believe will be the next phase of crypto market evolution. The Scale of This Investor’s Ethereum Holdings This isn’t the first time this particular Bitcoin OG has made headlines for their ETH accumulation. Their wallet address has become a point of fascination for market observers. To date, this address has accumulated an astounding total of 886,371 ETH. At current valuations, this holding is worth approximately $4.07 billion. This makes them one of the largest individual Ethereum holders, underscoring their profound conviction in the asset’s future. Such a massive accumulation suggests a deep belief in Ethereum’s role in the future of finance and technology. It also highlights the potential for significant wealth creation within the crypto space for those with foresight and conviction. The transaction on Hyperliquid also indicates a preference for decentralized platforms, which offer greater privacy and control compared to centralized exchanges. What Does This Mean for the Broader Crypto Market? When a prominent Bitcoin OG makes such a substantial move, it often sends ripples through the market. While not necessarily a direct indicator of future price action, it can influence sentiment and encourage other investors to re-evaluate their own portfolios. It signals a potential shift in institutional or ‘smart money’ interest from purely Bitcoin to a more balanced approach that includes Ethereum. For newcomers to crypto, this serves as an important lesson: the market is dynamic. Even long-term holders continuously assess and adjust their strategies. It’s not just about holding; it’s about strategic allocation and understanding the evolving landscape. This move reinforces the narrative that Ethereum is maturing as a core component of the digital economy, rather than just an altcoin. Conclusion: A Glimpse into Strategic Crypto Investing The latest actions of this influential Bitcoin OG offer a compelling case study in strategic cryptocurrency investing. By selling a significant portion of their Bitcoin to accumulate a massive amount of Ethereum, this investor has demonstrated a clear conviction in ETH’s long-term potential. This move underscores the importance of diversification, understanding ecosystem growth, and maintaining a long-term vision in the volatile yet rewarding crypto market. It serves as a powerful reminder that even early pioneers continue to adapt their strategies in response to the ever-changing dynamics of the digital asset world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin OG? A Bitcoin OG, or Original Gangster, refers to an early investor or adopter of Bitcoin who has been involved with the cryptocurrency since its nascent stages. They are often characterized by their deep understanding of the market and significant holdings. Why did the Bitcoin OG sell BTC to buy ETH? While the exact reasons are private, common motivations for such a move include portfolio diversification, belief in Ethereum’s ecosystem growth and utility, anticipation of future network upgrades, or a long-term strategic re-allocation based on market outlook. How much ETH did the Bitcoin OG accumulate? In this particular instance, the investor sold 2,000 BTC to acquire 48,942 ETH. Their total accumulated ETH holdings now stand at 886,371 ETH, valued at over $4 billion. What is Hyperliquid (HYPE)? Hyperliquid (HYPE) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) where the large BTC to ETH conversion took place. DEXs allow users to trade cryptocurrencies directly from their wallets without needing a centralized intermediary, offering greater control and often lower fees for certain transactions. Does this mean Bitcoin is losing its value? Not necessarily. Such a move by a Bitcoin OG is typically a strategic re-allocation rather than a signal of Bitcoin losing value. Bitcoin remains a dominant force in crypto, often viewed as a store of value. This action highlights Ethereum’s growing importance and potential as a distinct asset class with different utilities.

51002343,570126,1756706427,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51002343.jpeg,Can Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Prices Recover? What To Expect In September,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-september/,"As the crypto market ushers in a new month, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu holders are faced with fresh hopes and fears, especially as the market remains uncertain and prices continue to fluctuate. In the current state, there is still some time until a particular direction is decided for the meme coins. However, taking a look at historical data and how both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices have previously performed in the month of September can often help with an idea of what to expect in the new month. How Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Prices Have Performed In September Shiba Inu has been in existence for a considerably lesser time than Dogecoin, with DOGE’s 12 years compared to SHIB’s five years. However, both meme coins seem to go hand in hand as the largest meme coins in the market. Hence, the performance of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices tends to go together as both are the market leaders in their niches. As a result, this report will look at the performances of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices over the last five years, maintaining a balance between the two meme coins. For both digital assets, though, there have been varying performances, suggesting a deviation in the month of September, according to data from CryptoRank. For example, back in September 2021, when the coin was first launched, the Shiba Inu saw a small 4.65% price increase. On the flip side, the Dogecoin price was actually beginning to crash at this point, recording a 26.7% decline by the time the month of September was over. The next two years, though, saw poor performance from both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, with Shiba Inu suffering losses . Then, in September 2024, there was a drastic change as both meme coins actually saw double-digit gains by the end of the month. What this suggests is that the month of September is a mixed bag for both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices. Mostly, the performance for September depends on the Bitcoin price and how the crypto market moves in general in the new month. October Is The Real Deal For Dogecoin and Shiba Inu investors looking for real gains, the time to look forward to would be the month of October. Since its launch in 2021, the Shiba Inu price has never had a red close in October, and it is the only month where the meme coin has consistently achieved gains. Dogecoin’s performance for the month of October is similar, with the last six years ending in consistent green closes for the meme coin. Simply put, the month of October is the most bullish month for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, often leading into November before the rally subsides.",Dogecoin|Shiba Inu|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-01 06:00:27

Pepe Coin Price Faces Headwinds Despite Loyal Community Yes, Pepe still commands a $1 billion daily trading volume and loyal whales occasionally scoop $2 million worth of tokens. But the cracks are showing. Resistance walls near $0.000011 keep growth capped, while bearish projections warn of potential dips to $0.00000708, a 30% collapse from current levels. Even optimistic scenarios barely stretch to $0.000028 by year-end. The writing on the wall is clear: Pepe’s upside looks increasingly limited, especially against projects offering real-world solutions. Smart money isn’t gambling anymore: it’s rotating. Remittix: The Crypto Pepe Investors Can’t Afford to Miss Remittix isn’t another meme coin; it’s the project built to dominate the $19 trillion global payments market. The layer-2 Ethereum alternative allows direct crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries, supports 40+ tokens, and delivers real-time FX conversion. In short: it’s the bridge between crypto and real-world money that meme coins could never build. Why are Pepe veterans pouring in? Because Remittix isn’t selling a dream, the top Defi project is delivering a system that already has exchange listings, business APIs, and CertiK audits verified. Add a mobile wallet launch in Q3 2025, and you’ve got the makings of a project that will do more than pump, it will sustain growth. What makes Remittix irresistible right now: Instant cross-border transfers: Crypto to bank in 24 hours. Massive multi-currency support: 40+ cryptos, 30+ fiat pairs. Security-first model: CertiK audits, liquidity locks, institutional-grade safety. Merchant adoption: Businesses can accept crypto, settle in fiat. Q3 wallet launch: A mobile-first gateway for everyday adoption. This isn’t optional. If you’re watching from the sidelines, you’re missing the shift Pepe investors have already started. Act Before Remittix Explodes Remittix early sales has raised more than $23 million, pulled in 25,000+ holders, and triggered one of the largest $250,000 giveaways in DeFi history. The next wave is imminent: BitMart and LBank listings are confirmed, and further CEX partnerships are on deck. When trading opens, early buyers will already be positioned for exponential upside. This is the “miss it, regret it” moment. Pepe coin holders clinging to meme momentum are gambling with stagnation, while those pivoting to Remittix are planting themselves in front of a financial revolution. The choice is brutally simple: Get in now: or watch another generation of crypto millionaires get made without you.

The company’s purchase was worth 16,479 billion yen (roughly $110 million), at an average buying price of 16.3 million yen per Bitcoin. The Japanese Bitcoin firm’s latest acquisition brought its total Bitcoin holdings to 20,000 Bitcoin purchased at an average price of 15.1 million yen per BTC. The company’s total holdings amount to around 302.312 billion yen (over $2 billion). Metaplanet’s latest Bitcoin acquisition strategy also adds to its ambitions to grow its stack to 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026, and 210,000 BTC by 2027. Metaplanet continues its Bitcoin accumulation strategy *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,009 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 20,000 BTC* pic.twitter.com/kwvUkQaFth — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) September 1, 2025 Metaplanet’s BTC Yield, which reflects the percentage change in the ratio of Total Bitcoin Holdings to fully Diluted Shares Outstanding over a given period, was 30.7% from July 1 to September 1, 2025. The company’s BTC Yield was slightly higher from April 1 to June 30, hitting 129.4%. On Monday, the BTC Treasury company released the status of the exercise of its 20th series of stock acquisition rights, which was issued on June 23 from August 27 to August 29. According to the report, the firm issued a total of 739,714,340 shares (including 25,867 treasury shares). Metaplanet also exercised 11.5 million shares since August 27, bringing the total number of issued shares as of August 29 to 751,214,340. The Japanese firm launched its Bitcoin accumulation strategy in April 2024. At the time of publication, on-chain data shows that Metaplanet ranks seventh globally in BTC holdings. The BTC treasury company reported strong earnings from April to July, reaching a total revenue of 1.2 billion yen ($8.4 million). According to its latest quarterly report, Metaplanet has seen a 41% surge quarter-on-quarter, with a profit of 11.1 billion yen ($75.1 million) in Q2. Metaplanet also expects full-year revenue of 3.4 billion yen ($23.1 million) and operating profit of 2.5 billion yen (roughly $17 million). The firm said its profits will stem from recurring cash-secured-put premiums and operational performance. The company’s president, Simon Gerovich, revealed that the firm’s Bitcoin income generation business has grown throughout the year. Our Bitcoin income generation business has grown for 3 straight quarters. This recurring income adds resilience and supports further accumulation. This also gives us flexibility to service potential future financing to enhance our treasury operations.” – Simon Gerovich , President of Metaplanet. Metaplanet’s latest acquisition saw its share price plummet nearly 4% in the last 24 hours to 844 JPY. The company has also seen a 136% surge in its stock price YTD. Metaplanet’s stock price has dropped by 54% since it hit a high of nearly 9,000 JPY in June. Bloomberg reported on Sunday that the decline has put the firm’s capital-raising mechanism under stress, which is dependent on rising share prices to unlock funding through MS warrants issued to its key investor, the Evo Fund. The report revealed that the drop in shares makes it less attractive for Evo to exercise these warrants, squeezing Metaplanet’s liquidity and slowing its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Metaplanet introduces capital-raising plan The Japanese firm aims to raise roughly 130.3 billion yen ($884.41 million) through a public share offering in overseas markets as part of its alternative fundraising efforts. Metaplanet shareholders are also expected to vote on Monday on whether to approve the issuance of up to 555 million new shares. The initiative could raise as much as 555 billion yen ($3.7 billion). Gerovich argued that the preferred shares are a sort of defensive mechanism, allowing capital infusion without diluting common shareholders if the stock falls further. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, the shares aim to offer up to 6% annual dividends. Initially capped at 25% of Metaplanet’s Bitcoin holdings, the shares may incentivize Japanese investors starved of yield. Metaplanet’s adviser Eric Trump is also expected to attend the firm’s shareholder meeting in Tokyo on Monday. Trump’s attendance follows an appearance last week at the Bitcoin Asia conference in Hong Kong.

He attached a chart that maps out critical support and resistance levels with time-based markers, all pointing to a notable rally before October 17. The chart depicts a period of consolidation following XRP’s surge in July, when it reached an all-time high of $3.65 . Since then, the asset’s price has experienced some turbulence, but has held above the $2.7 support level, with multiple daily closes clustering in that region. XRP Pre-ETF rally $4-$7 by October 17th. pic.twitter.com/c2THfuUenM — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) August 31, 2025 XRP Key Levels to Watch Horizontal yellow lines mark key levels at $3, $3.66, $4, and ultimately $7.01, which serve as potential upside targets if momentum returns. A large purple zone is highlighted between $4 and $7, aligning with Rector’s suggested range for a pre-ETF breakout. From a technical perspective, the consolidation phase represents an important inflection point. The $2.7 floor has so far acted as a base, while $3, which was previously a support level, now forms the first significant resistance that needs to be overcome for a move higher. A successful breakout above that threshold could clear the path to the $3.66 and $4 levels, where the chart anticipates renewed buying pressure. Timeline for ETF Approval The chart’s timeline is equally relevant. Vertical markers show dates extending into mid-October, with October 17, one day before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is required to decide on multiple spot XRP ETF applications . After multiple delays this summer, final decisions are now expected during the fourth quarter, with mid-October acting as a critical window. The end of the long-running XRP lawsuit removed one of the primary regulatory barriers that had stalled ETF progress for years, and Bloomberg has set the likelihood of spot XRP ETF approval in 2025 at 95% . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If confirmed, a spot XRP ETF would provide institutions with direct access to the asset, potentially driving new inflows into the market. Rector’s outlined targets of $4 to $7 correspond to substantial gains from current levels around $2.85, as a move to $4 would represent roughly a 40% increase, while a rally toward $7 would equate to more than a 145% gain. The possibility of a significant pre-ETF rally is not solely speculative. Futures-based XRP products have already seen strong institutional engagement . If spot ETF approval coincides with technical breakout conditions, the asset may surpass those targets and enter the phase of price discovery.

For many traders, understanding market sentiment is crucial, especially when it comes to derivatives like BTC perpetual futures . These instruments offer a unique window into the collective mindset of bulls and bears. Today, we are diving into the latest 24-hour long/short position ratio for BTC perpetual futures across the world’s top three crypto futures exchanges, ranked by open interest. This data provides a snapshot of trader positioning and can offer valuable insights into potential short-term market movements. The latest figures reveal a fascinating landscape: Overall, across these leading platforms, the sentiment is almost perfectly balanced: Long positions account for 49.88% , while Short positions stand at 50.12% . This indicates a near equilibrium between those betting on price increases and those anticipating declines. On Binance, Long positions are slightly ahead at 50.1%, with Shorts at 49.9%. Bybit shows a slight bearish tilt, with Longs at 49.96% and Shorts at 51.04%. Gate.io traders lean slightly bullish, with Longs at 50.13% and Shorts at 49.87%. What Do These BTC Perpetual Futures Ratios Really Mean? When we talk about the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio, we are essentially measuring the proportion of traders who are optimistic (long) versus those who are pessimistic (short) on Bitcoin’s immediate price action. A ratio above 1.0 (or 50% long) suggests a bullish bias, while a ratio below 1.0 (or 50% short) indicates a bearish inclination. However, it is not always straightforward. This metric is a powerful tool for gauging market sentiment. For instance, an extremely high long ratio might suggest over-optimism, potentially leading to a ‘long squeeze’ if prices drop. Conversely, a very high short ratio could signal an impending ‘short squeeze’ if prices unexpectedly rise, forcing short sellers to cover their positions. Understanding these dynamics is vital for navigating the volatile crypto market. How Do Individual Exchanges Compare in BTC Perpetual Futures Sentiment? While the overall ratio suggests a balanced market, a deeper look at individual exchanges reveals subtle differences in trader behavior. These variations, though small, can sometimes hint at specific trading patterns or liquidity concentrations. Let’s break down the data from the top three exchanges: Binance: Here, Long positions are slightly ahead at 50.1% , with Shorts at 49.9%. This indicates a marginal bullish leaning among Binance traders compared to the overall market. Bybit: Interestingly, Bybit shows a slight bearish tilt, with Longs at 49.96% and Shorts at 51.04% . This makes Bybit the only one of the top three exchanges to show a majority short position in this 24-hour window. Gate.io: Similar to Binance, Gate.io traders lean slightly bullish, with Longs at 50.13% and Shorts at 49.87% . This platform exhibits the highest long percentage among the three. These minor divergences underscore that market sentiment is not uniform across all platforms. Different user bases and regional preferences might contribute to these subtle but noticeable shifts in BTC perpetual futures positioning. Actionable Insights for Traders: Using BTC Perpetual Futures Data So, how can you use this information to inform your trading strategy? First, remember that these ratios are snapshots in time and can change rapidly. They are best used as a complementary indicator alongside other technical and fundamental analysis. Key takeaways for traders: Market Equilibrium: The overall near 50/50 split suggests a lack of strong directional conviction in the short term. This could lead to range-bound trading or increased volatility as neither side dominates. Watch for Extremes: While not extreme here, significant deviations from a 50/50 split (e.g., 70% long or 70% short) often precede market reversals. Traders might look to fade such extreme sentiment. Exchange-Specific Nuances: The slight bearish bias on Bybit, for example, could indicate a pocket of more cautious traders. This kind of data can help you understand the specific characteristics of different trading communities. Risk Management: Always prioritize sound risk management. Sentiment data helps you understand the playing field, but it does not predict the future with certainty. Position sizing and stop-loss orders remain paramount. Monitoring these BTC perpetual futures ratios regularly can enhance your understanding of market dynamics, helping you anticipate potential shifts and react more strategically. In conclusion, the current BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio on leading exchanges paints a picture of near-perfect balance, with a slight overall lean towards short positions. However, individual exchange data reveals subtle differences, indicating diverse trader sentiment across platforms. This invaluable data provides a crucial lens into the collective psychology of the market, offering insights that can complement your trading decisions. While no single metric guarantees success, understanding these ratios empowers you to make more informed choices in the ever-evolving world of Bitcoin trading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are BTC perpetual futures? A: BTC perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date. Q2: Why is the long/short ratio important for traders? A: The long/short ratio indicates the market sentiment by showing the proportion of traders holding long (bullish) positions versus short (bearish) positions. It helps traders gauge potential market reversals or continuation patterns. Q3: Does a 50/50 long/short ratio mean the market will stay flat? A: Not necessarily. A 50/50 ratio suggests a balanced sentiment, but it can also precede increased volatility as neither side has a clear advantage. The market could move strongly in either direction depending on new catalysts. Q4: How often does the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio change? A: The ratio changes constantly as traders open and close positions. The data presented here is a 24-hour snapshot, but real-time ratios are updated frequently by exchanges. Q5: Are these ratios a definitive buy or sell signal? A: No, these ratios are indicators of sentiment, not definitive trading signals. They should be used in conjunction with other technical analysis tools, price action, and fundamental news to form a comprehensive trading strategy.

The business model relies heavily on ETPs, but most digital assets are owed to ETP holders, creating significant leverage and potential solvency risks. While management is pursuing growth and product diversification, current innovations do not sufficiently de-risk the balance sheet or address the core leverage issue. Given high valuation multiples and unresolved risk factors, I rate DEFT as a Hold, awaiting a more attractive risk-reward profile before recommending a Buy. DeFi Technologies ( DEFT ) is a growing player in the crypto space. Despite industry tailwinds and recently growing AUM, I declined to rate the stock a Buy, with much of my concern stemming from its strategy around its ETP-based asset management. Business Model DeFi bills itself as a financial technology company that creates convergence between traditional capital markets and decentralized finance. This is currently reflected through the following revenue sources provided by their subsidiaries: Asset Management Arbitrage Trading Crypto market making Investments in related ventures Research platform Advisory Services Q2 2025 Financial Report As the table above indicates, the most significant contributors to total revenue are the returns on their digital assets, exchange-traded products (ETPs), and equity investments (which are mainly indirect stakes in digital assets), so I'll give a greater share of my attention to these areas in this thesis, particularly as the other revenue sources are secondary, adding on neatly to the primary sources but unlikely (in my view) to grow to comparable levels. Balance Sheet (Q2 2025 Financial Report) Looking at their balance sheet, the bulk of their total assets are digital assets (a portfolio of various cryptocurrencies). Many of these are simply held, but portions are set aside for loans and staking (which provide yield). Sample of Crypto Holdings (Q2 2025 MD&A Report) A look at their Q2 2025 MD&A Report (pg. 14) reflects a very diverse portfolio of crypto assets, valued at $553M as of June. Almost half is in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) at $262M, with other more prominent cryptos such as Ether ( ETH-USD ) and Solana ( SOL-USD ) making up prominent positions. Altogether, the portfolio is spread across dozens of positions. This is mainly explained by Valour's (their subsidiary) asset management business through ETP products. Sample of ETP Offerings (Q2 2025 Company Presentation) The slide above shows that they offer several different ETPs. These are mainly indexed to follow the individual items, which usually entails a single cryptocurrency. While they earn a flat 1.9% management fee across their ETP products, these also can explain their arbitrage business. ETPs are known to have NAV discrepancies from their index from time to time, and arbitrage trades can close that gap favorably for DeFi. Balance Sheet (Q2 2025 Financial Report) Looking now at the liabilities, the biggest item, far and away, is ETP holders payable. In essence, this is the value that clients who invest in their ETP products are owed, after management fees. Sample of ETP Holders Payable (Q2 2025 Financial Report) These explain where most of the digital assets are allocated. The payables listed above roughly equate to the reported values of their digital assets, meaning that very few of the assets on the balance are ultimately DeFi's for keeping. As explained in their Q2 MD&A report (pg. 55): Valour Cayman’s ETPs are non-interest-bearing debt securities that are designed to track the return of an underlying digital asset. The current Valour ETP program in place does not provide that those securities are collateralised. Although their yield references an underlying benchmark or asset, the ETPs are similar to unsecured, listed bonds. The logic of such securities is that investors can access them in a normal brokerage account, which they cannot do with crypto directly. Overall, it's a business model that functions in line with its mission statement. It provides a mixture of financial services that bridges the gap between normal capital markets and the decentralized world of crypto. Outlook and Valuation While there are adjacent sources of revenue, I believe these will only be successful if the core business in the ETPs is successful. I think there's a course of events where the company could enjoy strong growth, and I think there's also room for big problems to materialize. June 2025 Investor Deck Management has been discussing growth opportunities, largely through expansion into international capital markets, where they can issue more ETPs. June 2025 Investor Deck They also relate that the market for crypto has been growing, particularly for the BTC and SOL products. While AUM peaked coming out of 2024 and declined, it has recovered about midway through the year, coinciding with President Trump's regulatory embrace of stablecoins and blockchain, marked by his signing of the GENIUS Act. With secular trends favoring crypto and their expanding footprint, it stands to reason that a business like theirs will benefit a great deal. Balance Sheet Items (Q2 2025 Quarterly Report) Nevertheless, I think it's important to address the discrepancy between the ETP holders payable and total digital assets. While it explains much of their allocation among digital assets, the fact that they have about $220M less in digital assets than the consolidated liability of these ETPs effectively means they are using these products as leverage to fund the other portions of their business. Normal leverage comes with a fixed principal balance, something that doesn't simply decline on its own. Even variable-rate loans only adjust periodically, following incremental moves by a central reserve bank. ETPs are not like these things. Indexed to the return of an underlying item, the liability can balloon if the returns are strongly positive. Be investing this capital in other parts of the business, they are essentially betting that they can outperform their own products, at least soon enough that they could reposition as needed. Nevertheless, I think my point is made. As these products mature or are redeemed, there's a potential for a solvency problem. Cash Flow Statement (Q2 2025 Quarterly Report) As the cash flow statement shows, there is regular rotation of old and new ETPs, as much as a third of the balance of payables. Now the reverse logic also works. If the indexed items perform poorly, this limits the downside, effectively allowing them to invest with free capital. Of course, this requires the ETPs to perform poorly, but not so poorly that any company in crypto loses its raison d'être. With a market cap of $691M, it's well above its book value of $68.9M. Similarly, it's a big multiple (about 35) on its TTM earnings of $19.4M. Still a microcap in an industry with tailwinds, there is definitely potential for upside, but right now DEFT seems like it's priced only for that, not its plausible risk factors. There are ways in which this can be mitigated. During the Q4 2024 earnings call , they guided for a wider array of products in the future: So, we have a whole range of topics that will convert into productization for our end users. And obviously, digital assets is very interesting, but digital SX can also be mixed with various other commodities. We will see a lot of innovation happening with our recent acquisition of Neuronomics applying AI, not just to digital assets but also equities. Diversifying the business and capital commitments might de-risk the balance sheet quite a bit, but recent new products seem to be more of the same. Consequently, it's hard to see a compelling risk-reward asymmetry here. A multiple more like 20 would compensate investors better for the risk they assume with this business, and based on recent data, that would give a share price of about $1.17. Conclusion Operationally, DeFi has an astute business, connecting capital markets as we traditionally know them to the new world of crypto. In addition to its core business of asset management, it milks plenty of other revenue opportunities. On top of that, it's in an industry that is poised to enjoy tailwinds for the foreseeable future. The main risk is in the capitalization. Its ETPs give it liability that ETF issuers simply don't have to consider. As crypto is volatile and remains difficult to predict, so too is this liability.

This is only natural, considering that Ether has more than doubled in price in a little over two months after spending a couple of years in the doldrums. The big increase in the exit queue led to a lot of FUD about a massive Ether sell-off and price crash, but this is largely unfounded because the entry queue for staking has also surged. The entry queue hit its highest level since 2023 on Sunday at 787,255 ETH worth around $3.4 billion, according to ValidatorQueue. Forget the ETH unstaking FUD. Entry queue just hit 787k ETH ($3.5B). Recent highs! And continues to climb while unstaking amounts peaked. The great rotation for $ETH is underway. pic.twitter.com/L96bYrb417 — Ignas | DeFi (@DefiIgnas) August 31, 2025 Ether Moving From Weak to Strong Hands However, it was pointed out that ETH in the entry queue has already been purchased, so its impact on spot prices has been seen, whereas the Ether in the exit queue has yet to be processed by markets. There are currently around 35.7 million ETH staked, worth a whopping $157 billion and representing almost 30% of the entire supply, so the ecosystem is more than stable. “The ‘Great Rotation’ is also clear in retail selling, while whales and institutions are buying,” said DeFi researcher Ignas. There have been billions in Ether ETF inflows in August, digital asset treasuries are still accumulating the asset, and whales are publicly rotating billions from BTC into ETH, yet the price has not surged because retail is selling, he added in a separate post. “Supply moving from weak to strong hands. Same setup before every big run.” $ETH has large ETF inflows, DATs buying, and HL whale publicly rotating billions of BTC into ETH. Price still flat. Why? Retail is selling: • 100–1k ETH holders dumping • 10k–100k whales loading fast Supply moving from weak to strong hands. Same setup before every big run. pic.twitter.com/uk9UGZwbma — Ignas | DeFi (@DefiIgnas) August 30, 2025 “Capital has been rotating from Bitcoin into Ethereum,” said popular analyst Will Woo last week. Meanwhile, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck labelled the asset “the Wall Street token” last week, explaining that financial institutions must adopt Ethereum to facilitate stablecoin transfers or risk falling behind. Consensys founder Joseph Lubin made the bold prediction that “ETH will likely 100x from here. Probably much more,” because Wall Street needs it for decentralized rails. He also said that Ether will flip Bitcoin as the monetary base. ETH Price Stalls No such bullishness is happening at the moment on spot markets as weak retail hands continue to sell, sending the asset down 1.4% on the day as it trades at $4,380. Ether has now retreated almost 12% from its peak of $4,950 a week ago, but remains within its range-bound channel that formed three weeks ago when the asset broke above $4,000. Analysts are still confident that Ether has a long way to go in this bull run despite it stalling at current levels. ETHEREUM IS TRACKING GLOBAL LIQUIDITY Accumulation is done. The bull run is alive. Global liquidity is expanding higher and $ETH is mirroring the move. This isn’t hopium, it’s macro.

Key Takeaways: Sonic Labs received near-unanimous approval to issue $200 million in S tokens for U.S. market expansion. $100 million will back a Nasdaq-listed PIPE vehicle, while $50 million supports a token-tracking ETP. Sonic is establishing a U.S. entity to lead its push into traditional finance and modernize outdated tokenomics. The vote, which concluded Sunday , saw 99.99% of participating wallets back the plan. With over 700 million tokens used in the governance process, the proposal met the required quorum, signaling strong alignment within the Sonic community. Sonic to Allocate $100M in Tokens for Nasdaq-Listed PIPE Vehicle Sonic’s strategy includes allocating $100 million in S tokens to fund a strategic reserve supporting a planned Nasdaq-listed PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) vehicle. An additional $50 million will go toward backing an exchange-traded product (ETP) that tracks the S token. The product, according to Sonic, will be issued by a top-tier, regulated ETF provider managing over $10 billion in assets and custodied by BitGo. To support its U.S. expansion, Sonic will establish a new entity, Sonic USA LLC, and recruit a New York-based leadership team to steer its efforts in Washington, D.C., and across the traditional finance landscape. The project plans to allocate 150 million S tokens (valued at roughly $47.7 million) to jumpstart the new division. While a growing number of public companies have turned to crypto to diversify their balance sheets, Sonic is taking a different route, using established financial structures to push deeper into the crypto sector. The move marks a rare reversal of the typical crypto-to-TradFi playbook. Bottom Line Developers on Sonic can now integrate U.S. economic data, such as GDP, inflation, and consumption into their contracts. This will help fuel next-gen lending, derivatives, and risk products. — Sonic (@SonicLabs) August 28, 2025 Sonic launched in December 2024, evolving from the Fantom Opera network through a token migration where FTM tokens were swapped 1:1 for S tokens. However, Sonic inherited restrictive tokenomics from Fantom, with less than 3% of tokens controlled by the Foundation, leaving the team with limited flexibility to fund initiatives or forge major partnerships. According to the project, this constraint caused missed opportunities, including potential engagements with GameStop, Robinhood, and Polymarket, and prevented early listings on major exchanges. “We have 2018 tokenomics. We need 2025 tokenomics,” Sonic stated in the proposal. Sonic Plans Gas Fee Overhaul to Boost S Token Deflation To counterbalance the new token issuance, Sonic will revise its gas fee system and increase the burn rate of transaction fees, aiming to apply deflationary pressure to the token’s supply. The company says this will allow it to participate in capital markets without diluting long-term holders. The S token has faced significant headwinds, dropping nearly 69% since its January debut, per CoinGecko. Meanwhile, Sonic is part of a U.S. Department of Commerce initiative to bring economic data onchain using Chainlink and Pyth oracles, enabling developers to access real-time macroeconomic indicators directly through its blockchain. In May, the High Court of Singapore approved a winding-up order against Multichain Foundation Ltd following a 2023 security breach that caused over $210 million in user losses. The order, issued on May 9 , 2025, came in response to a petition filed by Sonic Labs, which was among the platforms affected by the hack.

For years, many investors considered Bitcoin a digital equivalent to gold, a safe haven against economic uncertainty. However, recent developments suggest this long-held belief is undergoing a dramatic re-evaluation. The Bitcoin-gold correlation , once a strong talking point, is now showing clear signs of weakening, leaving analysts and investors alike pondering the implications. Understanding the Shifting Bitcoin-Gold Correlation Recent reports highlight a surprising divergence between two of the most talked-about assets: Bitcoin and gold. Following President Donald Trump’s remarks last week concerning inflation, the market reacted in unexpected ways. While many anticipated a synchronized movement, the reality proved different, challenging established investment narratives. Cointelegraph, citing multiple analysts, reported a rapid weakening of the Bitcoin-gold correlation . This shift became particularly evident after the President suggested there was ‘almost no inflation’ in the U.S. What followed was a stark contrast in performance. Gold’s Surge: Despite the inflation remarks, gold’s price soared, renewing its all-time high, reinforcing its traditional role as a store of value. Bitcoin’s Correction: In stark contrast, Bitcoin experienced a significant correction, dropping over 13% from its peak and hitting a two-month low. This divergence has caught the attention of market watchers, prompting a closer look at the underlying dynamics of these two assets. Why is the Bitcoin-Gold Correlation Weakening? What’s driving this noticeable split? Vince Yang, co-founder of zkLink, offers a compelling perspective. He has observed a weak, or even negative, Bitcoin-gold correlation throughout the current year. His analysis sheds light on the fundamental differences influencing their market behavior. Yang explains that while gold continues to hold its ground as a primary safe-haven asset, Bitcoin operates under different pressures. Gold’s value often rises during periods of economic instability or inflation fears, serving as a reliable hedge. Its appeal lies in its scarcity, historical significance, and tangible nature. Conversely, Bitcoin, despite its growing acceptance, remains more susceptible to fluctuations driven by liquidity and broader market risk factors. Its price can be heavily influenced by: Liquidity Changes: Large movements of capital in and out of the crypto market. Market Sentiment: Investor confidence, regulatory news, and overall risk appetite. Macroeconomic Factors: While gold reacts to inflation, Bitcoin can be more sensitive to interest rate changes or global economic growth outlooks, sometimes acting more like a tech stock than a traditional commodity. Therefore, the perceived similarity between Bitcoin and gold as ‘digital gold’ is increasingly being re-evaluated in light of these distinct market sensitivities. Navigating the Divergence: Implications for Investors The weakening Bitcoin-gold correlation presents both challenges and opportunities for investors. Understanding this shift is crucial for refining investment strategies and diversifying portfolios effectively. It suggests that treating Bitcoin purely as a gold substitute might be an oversimplification. Investors should consider the following: Diversification Rethink: If Bitcoin and gold no longer move in tandem, they could offer more effective diversification benefits when combined in a portfolio. Risk Assessment: Bitcoin’s higher volatility and sensitivity to market liquidity mean it carries different risk profiles compared to gold. Investors need to assess their risk tolerance accordingly. Independent Analysis: Relying on the historical correlation might be misleading. Each asset now requires independent analysis based on its unique drivers and market conditions. This new dynamic encourages a more nuanced approach to asset allocation, recognizing the evolving roles of both traditional and digital assets in a complex global economy. The Future Landscape: Bitcoin, Gold, and Market Volatility As global markets continue to grapple with inflation concerns, geopolitical events, and technological advancements, the future relationship between Bitcoin and gold will remain a key area of observation. The current weakening trend suggests a maturity in the crypto market, where Bitcoin is carving out its own identity beyond just being ‘digital gold’. It’s becoming clear that while both assets offer value, their paths are increasingly distinct. Gold’s steadfast role as a traditional safe haven is unlikely to diminish soon, whereas Bitcoin’s journey is characterized by innovation, adoption, and a different set of market influences. This evolving landscape demands vigilance and adaptability from investors. The recent reports of a weakening Bitcoin-gold correlation mark a pivotal moment in financial analysis. This divergence, influenced by distinct market dynamics and investor perceptions, underscores the importance of independent evaluation for each asset. As we move forward, understanding these unique drivers will be essential for making informed investment decisions in an ever-changing economic environment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Bitcoin-gold correlation? The Bitcoin-gold correlation refers to how closely the prices of Bitcoin and gold move in relation to each other. Historically, some investors believed Bitcoin acted similarly to gold as a hedge against inflation or economic uncertainty. Why did analysts expect Bitcoin and gold to correlate? Analysts often expected a correlation because both assets are seen as scarce, decentralized, and outside traditional financial systems. Bitcoin earned the moniker ‘digital gold’ due to these perceived similarities, especially its limited supply, much like gold. What factors are causing the Bitcoin-gold correlation to weaken? The weakening correlation is attributed to several factors. Gold maintains its traditional safe-haven status, reacting to inflation and economic instability. Bitcoin, however, is increasingly influenced by broader market liquidity, risk appetite, and specific cryptocurrency market dynamics, making it more sensitive to different economic signals. How should investors adjust their strategy given this divergence? Investors should re-evaluate their portfolio diversification, recognizing that Bitcoin and gold may now serve different roles. It’s crucial to conduct independent analysis for each asset, understanding their unique drivers and risk profiles, rather than assuming a synchronized movement. Is Bitcoin still considered a ‘digital gold’? While Bitcoin shares some characteristics with gold, the recent weakening correlation suggests its role is evolving beyond a direct ‘digital gold’ substitute. It’s carving out its own identity, influenced by technological adoption and its distinct market factors, making it a unique asset class.

These pilots are described as efforts to test Ripple’s payment solutions with institutions already involved in cross-border settlements . The pilots were designed to evaluate Ripple’s ability to lower costs, improve speed, and support reliable international transfers while remaining compliant with regulatory standards. While the text makes clear these were pilot tests rather than full-scale rollouts, it confirms that Ripple engaged directly with major financial institutions to demonstrate the potential of its network. Stellar’s Role in Nigeria The same source includes a reference to the Stellar network’s application in Africa, specifying that it was being used to provide interoperability between mobile money operators in Nigeria. It further notes that this model was also being extended to Kenya and Ghana. The stated purpose was to connect different mobile money providers, reducing fragmentation and enabling customers to transact across separate platforms. Additionally, the text mentions Stellar’s role in facilitating remittances to the Philippines. It mentions the early usage of the network in emerging markets where wallet-based payments dominate everyday financial activity.

Ripple’s testing with globally active banks targeted institutional use cases, while Stellar’s focus was on consumer-level connectivity across mobile wallets in developing regions. By citing both projects, the document illustrates the dual approach taken in blockchain-based payment innovation, with one track centered on traditional banking systems and the other on mobile-first payment infrastructure in Africa and Asia.

This shift in the bond market could also provide a boost to bitcoin (BTC). Over the past ten days, the price of gold has increased by more than 5% to $3,480 per ounce, inching closer to the record high of $3,499 set on April 22, according to TradingView data. The rally coincides with a steepening U.S. Treasury yield curve, as the spread between 10-year and 2-year yields (10y2y) widened to 61 basis points – the highest since January 2022. Meanwhile, the gap between 30-year and 2-year yields reached 1.30%, the widest since November 2021. This steepening has been driven largely by a faster decline in the 2-year yield, which fell 33 basis points to 3.62% in August, compared to a smaller 14-basis-point decline in the 10-year yield, now at 4.23%. In bond market terms, this is known as a “bull steepening,” where shorter-term bond prices rise more sharply (yields fall) than longer-term ones. ((Bond prices move in the opposite direction of yields.) Ole Hansen, Head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo Bank, explained that this dynamic is positive for gold. ""For gold, lower front-end yields ease the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. This shift is particularly relevant for real asset managers, many of whom have struggled—or in some cases been restricted—from allocating to gold, while U.S. funding costs were elevated,"" Hansen said in an analysis note Thursday. Hansen explained that the total holdings in bullion-backed ETFs declined by 800 tons between 2022 and 2024, as the Fed raised rates to combat inflation, which sent short-duration yields higher. Bitcoin is often compared to gold as a store of value, and like gold, it is considered a non-yielding asset. Neither Bitcoin nor gold generates interest or dividends; their value is primarily driven by scarcity, demand, and market perception. So, the decline in the two-year yield could be considered a bullish development for BTC. Meanwhile, the relative resilience of longer-duration yields is attributed to expectations of sticky inflation and other factors, which also support the bullish case in gold and BTC. ""The U.S. Treasury curve has unsurprisingly steepened: lower rates today risk inflaming inflation further ahead, which is bad news for bonds,"" analysts at ING said in a note to clients Friday. Hansen explained that much of the relative resilience in the 10-year yield stems from inflation breakevens, currently at around 2.45%, and the rest represents the real yield. ""[It] signals that investors are demanding greater compensation for fiscal risks and potential political interference with monetary policy. This environment typically supports gold as both an inflation hedge and a safeguard against policy credibility concerns,"" Hansen noted. The nominal yield is made up of two components: Firstly, the inflation breakeven, which reflects the market's expectation for average inflation over the bond's maturity. This portion of the yield compensates for the loss of purchasing power due to inflation. The second component is the real yield, which represents the additional compensation that purchasers demand above and beyond inflation. Bull steepening is bearish for stocks Historically, gold and gold miners have been among the best performers during prolonged periods of bull steepening in the yield curve, according to analysis by Advisor Perspectives . Conversely, stocks tend to underperform in these environments. Overall, bitcoin finds itself in an intriguing position, given its dual nature as an emerging technology that often moves with the Nasdaq, while also sharing gold-like qualities as a store of value.

Which one will fetch me more money?” On the one hand, Cardano (ADA) is steadily expanding its ecosystem through upgrades and staking returns. And the other, Remittix (RTX) , fresh off a breakout presale, is poised to capitalise on transaction potential. Yes, both could move your money, but with different ROIs. Let’s flesh it out quickly. Cardano’s 2025 Forecast: Cautious Optimism A glance at the ADA’s price chart reveals that the coin is currently trading below $1, but technical indicators suggest the presence of bullish momentum. Analysts expect it could reach $1.50 in the near term, especially if recent upgrades, such as Hydra, gain traction and broader sentiment remains strong. It may even touch $3 by year-end under aggressive scenarios. That means your $500 could buy you about 555 ADA at $0.90 today, potentially worth $833 if ADA climbs to $1.50, or $1,665 if it hits $3 soon enough. Remittix’s Rocket Potential Meanwhile, Remittix is in another league, or, to be more precise, a galaxy, depending on how you view it. The Ethereum-based PayFi project has captured investor attention, raising almost $23 million in presales and selling over 637 million tokens at under $0.1000 each. What makes it attention-worthy: A beta wallet is launching in mid-September, with its interface already tested. A CertiK audit is done, and BitMart , LBank , and other CEX listings are about to go live. Real-world utility targeting cross-border crypto-to-fiat transfers. Here’s where it gets surreal: blockchain news outlets suggest 5,000% to 6,000% upside might follow if adoption scales into 2025. So, with an investment of $500, which would get you about 5000 RTX tokens today, you are expecting an ROI of $5,000 to $6,000 if everything goes as planned by the Remittix team. Cardano Vs. Remittix: A Striking Contrast Choosing between Cardano and Remittix is choosing between two narratives: Cardano is dependable, with its growth grounded in development and infrastructure. Think of it as the economy car of crypto: safe, reliable, predictable. Remittix is the rocket: risky, fast, and built for lift-off. It’s not just hype; it’s launching with infrastructure, product, and utility baked in. That’s why, in today’s rapid market cycles, Remittix might just give you the kind of return that stories are made of this month, not years down the line. Meanwhile, Cardano remains a strategic, steady bet for those who like to ride their gains. In the end, if your goal is to chase explosive short-term returns, Remittix is the ticket. Your $500 could become $5,000+ in just weeks if everything falls into place. But if you prefer a measured, tech-backed path with less volatility, Cardano aims for steady, long-term gains. All that will depend on your choice, which reflects your investment style: rocket fuel or steady cruise control?

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/long-inactive-bitcoin-whale-sells-btc-and-buys-large-volumes-of-ethereum-here-are-the-details/,"According to data shared by on-chain analysis platform Lookonchain, a “Bitcoin whale” that has been inactive in the market for a long time has made a remarkable transaction again. Bitcoin Whale Makes Huge Move: Sold 2,000 BTC and Bought 48,942 ETH The whale in question sold 2,000 Bitcoins (approximately $215 million) and purchased 48,942 Ethereum (ETH) for the same value in the last four hours. According to the data, this investor stands out not only with his recent moves but also with his long-standing strategic acquisitions. The whale has reportedly accumulated a total of 886,400 ETH to date, reaching a market capitalization of $4.07 billion. This amount is among the highest wallet balances among individual investors in the Ethereum ecosystem. Whale activity in cryptocurrency markets is considered a key indicator of price direction. Experts believe this whale's accelerated Bitcoin sales and shift to Ethereum indicate that ETH is becoming increasingly prominent in investment strategies. In particular, increasing institutional interest in spot ETH ETFs and record increases in transaction volume on the network may be the reason for this preference. Market analysts say that purchases of this scale could provide support to the Ethereum price in the medium term, but could also increase selling pressure on Bitcoin. The new moves the whale will make in the coming days are among the main developments that investors will closely follow. *This is not investment advice.

In an interview with the Financial Times , Tirole said he was “very, very worried” about how stablecoins are supervised. He cautioned that a loss of confidence in their reserves could spark a rush of withdrawals, undermining the peg to traditional assets. Stablecoins such as those issued by Tether and Circle are digital currencies pegged to real-world assets like the US dollar. They are usually backed by reserves that include cash, Treasury bonds or other securities.

Analysts at Citi forecast the market could expand to $1.6 trillion by 2030, with an optimistic scenario pushing it as high as $3.7 trillion. A bearish view suggests growth could stall near $500b. Meanwhile, the US Treasury projects the market could reach US$2 trillion by 2028. Stablecoin exchange reserves hit a record $68B — but market cap growth is slowing, @CryptoQuant_com reports. #Crypto #Stablecoins https://t.co/r3fTEVq06V — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 27, 2025 Tirole, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2014 and teaches at the Toulouse School of Economics, said retail investors often view stablecoins as “a perfectly safe deposit.” Yet he warned they could quickly become a source of losses and trigger government rescues if reserves falter. Falling Reserves May Trigger A Run On Tokens He pointed to the drawbacks of holding US government bonds, a common reserve asset for stablecoin issuers. Yields on Treasuries have at times turned negative once adjusted for inflation, making them unattractive to issuers seeking higher returns. That search for better performance could tempt issuers to shift into riskier assets, Tirole said. Such a move would heighten the chance of losses in reserve portfolios, potentially sparking a run on the tokens. In that scenario, stablecoins could fall below their peg to sovereign currencies, further eroding confidence. Tirole warned that stablecoins could also lose value their value. Effective Oversight Requires Resources And Incentives: Tirole both retail and institutional investors suffered losses, governments would face mounting pressure to intervene, he added. Over recent decades, only a small number of uninsured depositors in traditional banks have borne losses, the economist noted. This history, he argued, raises expectations that governments would again step in to prevent savers from being wiped out. The economist said these risks could be contained if supervisors had enough resources and incentives to act diligently. However, he doubted whether that standard was being met, citing the political and financial interests of some members of the US administration in crypto. The debate comes as stablecoins continue to anchor much of global crypto trading. Supporters see them as essential for bridging fiat and digital finance, while critics worry about the lack of transparency and the potential burden on taxpayers if a collapse occurs.

This brings its total holdings to 20,000 BTC valued at over $2 billion at current market prices. $2 Billion Milestone The Japanese investment firm disclosed on September 1 that the latest buy was made at an average price of around $111,068 per coin. The corporation has also achieved a BTC yield of 30.7% from July to September 1, a key performance indicator that reflects the percentage change in the ratio of its Bitcoin holdings to fully diluted common shares. Metaplanet has been on a BTC buying spree in the past couple of months, with several high-profile purchases made in August alone. Early in the month, the company secured 463 BTC for about $53.7 million, followed by a 518 BTC buy for $61.4 million. Shortly after, it added another 775 BTC in a single deal worth $93 million, lifting its total to 18,888 BTC. Toward the end of August, the outfit completed its largest transaction of the period, acquiring 1,009 BTC for $112 million. The company has reached 20,000 BTC in holdings in under three months since crossing the 10,000 BTC mark. Earlier this year, it raised its year-end target from 10,000 BTC to 30,000 BTC. To support this expansion, Metaplanet has launched a massive capital-raising initiative, securing $837 million through international share offerings, with most of this capital set aside for further buys in September and October. Following the Monday announcement, the Japanese firm has officially become the sixth-largest public Bitcoin treasury company in the world, surpassing Riot Platforms. This milestone places it just behind major players like MicroStrategy and Marathon Digital. Market Reaction Despite the development, Google Finance data shows that the corporation’s stock is down by 4.5%. However, it remains up 135% year-to-date. Elsewhere, Metaplanet will hold a shareholder meeting in Tokyo on Monday to vote on new methods of raising capital. The agenda includes approving additional financing options, such as preferred stock issuances, which could generate billions in funding for further Bitcoin purchases. A Bloomberg report had revealed that Eric Trump, the second son of U.S. President Donald Trump, was expected to attend the meeting in person. This follows his appointment in March 2025 as a strategic adviser to Metaplanet’s board, with the company describing him as a “leading voice and advocate of digital asset adoption worldwide.” The post Metaplanet Hits 20,000 BTC Mark With $112 Million Purchase appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Metaplanet,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-09-01 07:18:45

Market turbulence was amplified by institutional liquidation flows totaling $1.9B since July , prompting fears of cyclical exhaustion. In contrast, whales accumulated 340M XRP over the past two weeks , highlighting contradictory behavior between large holders and short-term liquidators. September seasonality and ongoing regulatory pressure in the U.S. add to caution: crypto markets have historically underperformed in September, while unresolved SEC actions keep institutions wary. On-chain data shows activity on the XRP Ledger trending higher, with symmetrical-triangle formations reminiscent of 2017 pre-breakout conditions. Liquidity maps suggest concentrations up to $4.00 that could amplify any upside move. Price Action Summary The sharpest decline came at 23:00 GMT on Aug. 31, when XRP dropped from $2.80 to $2.77 on 76.87M volume , nearly triple the daily average of 27.3M. Support was tested again during the final hour (01:31–02:30 GMT, Sept. 1) as price fell from $2.77 to $2.75, with spikes of 10M+ tokens per minute confirming forced liquidations. Earlier in the day, XRP briefly touched $2.87 before retreating, as institutional selling capped rallies above $2.80. Technical Analysis Support : $2.75–$2.77 remains the immediate base; below this, $2.50 and $2.00 are critical longer-term levels. Resistance : Heavy rejection at $2.80–$2.87 marks the ceiling for now; $3.30 is the higher-term breakout line. Momentum : RSI dipped into the mid-40s before stabilizing, suggesting oversold conditions. MACD : Bearish divergence persists but histogram compression points to potential crossover if accumulation continues. Patterns : Symmetrical triangle + double-bottom formations align with long-term cup-and-handle structure. Analysts flag upside potential to $5–$13 if resistance breaks and liquidity pockets above $4.00 are tapped. Volume : The 76.87M spike during the $2.80 breakdown confirms distribution, but whale absorption of 340M tokens in the background supports the case for accumulation. What Traders Are Watching Can $2.75 hold as the new floor into early September trading? A close above $2.87 would flip bias toward a run at $3.30.

Get ready for an important update regarding your crypto assets. Binance has announced a temporary Binance CELO suspension for deposits and withdrawals, a crucial step to support an upcoming network upgrade and hard fork. This move, scheduled to begin at 2:00 p.m. UTC on September 10th, ensures the seamless and secure evolution of the Celo network. What Does the Binance CELO Suspension Entail? Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, is temporarily halting CELO deposits and withdrawals . This isn’t an unusual event in the fast-paced crypto world. Such suspensions are standard practice when a blockchain network undergoes significant technical enhancements. The specific reason behind this temporary halt is to facilitate a planned network upgrade and hard fork for the Celo blockchain. These upgrades are vital for improving the network’s performance, security, and functionality. Think of it like a major software update for your computer – sometimes you need to pause certain operations for the update to install correctly. Users should mark their calendars for 2:00 p.m. UTC on September 10th. After this time, any attempts to deposit or withdraw CELO on Binance will not be processed until the suspension is lifted. It’s always wise to stay informed directly through Binance’s official announcements. Why is a Binance CELO Suspension Necessary for Upgrades? Network upgrades and hard forks are complex technical processes. During these times, the blockchain’s underlying code is modified, potentially creating two separate chains if not managed carefully. To prevent any loss of funds, transaction errors, or inconsistencies, exchanges like Binance take proactive measures. By temporarily pausing CELO transactions , Binance ensures that all user funds are secure and accounted for during the transition. It also allows the exchange to properly integrate the new network parameters once the upgrade is complete. This protective step safeguards user assets and maintains the integrity of the trading platform. Ultimately, these upgrades are designed to bring significant benefits to the Celo network and its users. They can lead to: Enhanced security features. Improved transaction speeds. New functionalities and smart contract capabilities. Greater network stability. The temporary Binance CELO suspension is a small inconvenience for a greater good, paving the way for a more robust and efficient Celo ecosystem. Navigating the Temporary CELO Deposit and Withdrawal Suspension For CELO holders, understanding how to navigate this period is crucial. While your CELO assets remain safe on Binance, you won’t be able to move them in or out of the exchange during the specified time. Here’s what you can do: Plan Ahead: If you need to deposit or withdraw CELO, make sure to complete your transactions before 2:00 p.m. UTC on September 10th. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on Binance’s official announcements page or their social media channels for real-time updates regarding the resumption of services. Do Nothing (If Unaffected): If you don’t plan to move your CELO during this period, no action is required from your side. Your holdings will remain secure. Binance typically resumes deposit and withdrawal services once the upgraded network is stable and fully operational. They will usually notify users through a separate announcement. Patience during these periods is key, as ensuring network stability is paramount. What Happens After the Binance CELO Suspension is Lifted? Once the network upgrade and hard fork are successfully completed, and Binance has verified the stability of the new chain, the temporary CELO deposit and withdrawal suspension will be lifted. Users will then be able to resume their normal transactions without interruption. The goal of this entire process is to provide a better, more secure, and efficient experience for all Celo network participants. These proactive measures by exchanges like Binance are a testament to their commitment to user safety and the overall health of the blockchain ecosystem. So, while a brief pause might seem inconvenient, it’s a necessary step towards progress. In conclusion, the upcoming Binance CELO suspension for deposits and withdrawals is a temporary, yet vital, measure. It ensures the smooth execution of a critical network upgrade and hard fork for the Celo blockchain. By understanding the reasons behind this pause and planning accordingly, CELO holders can navigate this period with confidence, knowing that these steps ultimately contribute to a stronger and more reliable Celo network. Stay tuned to official Binance channels for the latest updates on when services will resume.

The token is currently trading at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, a 250% gain from its opening price of $0.01. Since the presale began, $15,220,000 has been raised and the number of holders has climbed to 15,880. Demand is accelerating as Phase 6 continues selling out fast. Under Phase 7, the asset is expected to increase its valuation, though less privilege by 14.3 per cent, to be evaluated at $0.04, before realising an appreciable rise to $0.06 at launch. Investors who join at this point have banked on the possibility of earning a 300-500 per cent increase on their returns after launch, a trend that has been witnessed before in other cryptocurrencies including Ripple (XRP). Ripple’s Historic Rally Ripple’s XRP remains a classic example of how fast crypto prices can shift. In 2017, XRP started the year at around $0.006. Over the following months, it rose sharply, reaching a peak of $3.84 in December. That meant investors who entered at the lowest price saw a return exceeding 60,000%. This rally turned Ripple into one of the top cryptocurrencies of that era. Importantly, the growth came during a time when crypto investing was entering mainstream discussions. The precedent highlights how quickly momentum can build once utility and speculation combine. Consequently, analysts tracking new cryptocurrency projects are pointing out similarities in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s early progress. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a company that has been attracting attention as it is following the same path as early XRP. The token already increased by $0.01 in the initial stage of the presale to $0.035 in Phase 6. Investors who joined early have already seen their holdings grow 3.5 times. Moreover, the upcoming transition into Phase 7 will push the price to $0.04, a 14.3% jump. Since the token is launching at $0.06, current buyers are set to secure attractive returns. The capped supply of 4 billion tokens supports this growth outlook by limiting dilution. Moreover, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a two-pronged lending platform which combines peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending. This gives investors multiple ways to generate yield while providing borrowers flexible terms. It is also introducing a stablecoin minted only when loans are issued, then burned upon repayment. Security And Community Growth The project achieved a score of 95.00 in a final CertiK audit. Evaluation found no weak points, and it would appear that there have been no security incidents on the system in the last 90 days. In order to create additional trust, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has introduced a Bug Bounty Program of $50,000 with CertiK. In addition, the team has introduced a dashboard that tracks the top 50 holders. Those who maintain their ranking will receive bonus tokens, rewarding commitment and strengthening the community base. Excitement is also being fueled by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s biggest giveaway yet. Ten winners are sharing a total of $100,000 MUTM tokens , with each winner getting $10,000. Unlike short-lived tokens that rely purely on hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is tying growth to real DeFi use cases. Lenders can earn through mtTokens while borrowers gain flexibility through P2P terms. As a result, the protocol is positioning itself to compete among the best crypto projects in decentralized lending. This structured model makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a serious option for those exploring what crypto to buy now. Building Toward The Next Big Move Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging at a time when investors are searching for the next big cryptocurrency. This presale is keeping the focus squarely on this presale as the comparison to the explosive growth of XRP in 2017. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), therefore, appears to be one of the most interesting cryptocurrencies to invest in now, and its value currently lies below the mark of $0.05. For anyone asking what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to present a clear case for long-term value.

Leading digital asset services provider Matrixport has issued a significant warning in its latest report, indicating that Bitcoin could face further price drops after its recent retreat to the $106,000-$108,000 range. This forecast has investors and enthusiasts closely monitoring the market, wondering what lies ahead for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Why is Matrixport Predicting a Bitcoin Decline? Matrixport’s analysis points to several critical factors contributing to the heightened risk of a Bitcoin decline . Since the end of July, BTC has encountered intensified resistance, largely attributed to seasonal market patterns. These historical trends often see specific periods in the year posing challenges for asset appreciation, and Bitcoin appears to be currently caught in this cycle. The report specifically highlights the current price range of $106,000-$108,000 as a crucial technical level. This isn’t just an arbitrary number; it represents a point where significant buying or selling pressure has historically emerged. A breach of this level could signal a lack of strong support, potentially leading to further downward movement. Understanding these technical thresholds is vital for anticipating market shifts. Navigating Volatility: US Jobs Data and Interest Rates Adding another layer of complexity to the market outlook is the impending release of key U.S. jobs data. Such economic indicators often trigger substantial volatility across financial markets, and cryptocurrencies are no exception. Here’s why this data matters: Market Sensitivity: Strong or weak jobs data can influence expectations for the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. Investor Sentiment: Positive economic news might draw capital away from riskier assets like Bitcoin, while negative news could lead to a flight to safety or further sell-offs. Furthermore, Matrixport addressed the widely discussed topic of U.S. interest rate cuts. While many in the crypto community view rate cuts as a bullish catalyst – making borrowing cheaper and potentially encouraging investment in risk assets – the report cautions that this process is “unlikely to be smooth.” This means: Phased Approach: Rate cuts might be gradual, not immediate or aggressive. Market Reaction: Each announcement or hint of a rate change could lead to short-term market fluctuations, creating periods of uncertainty. Broader Economic Context: The reasons behind rate cuts (e.g., economic slowdown) could also impact investor confidence in a way that offsets the perceived bullishness. Understanding the Challenges for Bitcoin’s Future The current market environment presents distinct challenges for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. The combination of seasonal resistance, critical technical levels, and macro-economic uncertainty creates a landscape where a sustained Bitcoin decline remains a significant possibility. Investors should be prepared for potential increased volatility and adjust their strategies accordingly. What are some actionable insights for investors? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on upcoming economic data releases, particularly U.S. jobs reports and Federal Reserve statements. Technical Analysis: Pay attention to key support and resistance levels. A sustained break below $106,000-$108,000 could indicate further downside. Risk Management: Consider diversifying portfolios and implementing stop-loss orders to mitigate potential losses during periods of heightened volatility. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Differentiate between short-term market noise and long-term fundamental value. Matrixport’s report serves as a timely reminder that the crypto market, while offering immense potential, is also subject to complex interplay of technical, seasonal, and macroeconomic forces. A prudent approach involves understanding these dynamics rather than reacting impulsively. In conclusion, Matrixport’s latest report highlights an urgent warning for a potential Bitcoin decline , driven by seasonal headwinds, critical technical resistance, and the unpredictable nature of macroeconomic events like U.S. jobs data and interest rate adjustments. While the path to lower interest rates is generally seen as favorable for cryptocurrencies, the journey itself is expected to be turbulent. Investors are encouraged to remain vigilant, informed, and strategic in navigating these challenging market conditions to protect their investments and capitalize on future opportunities. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Matrixport’s main concern regarding Bitcoin? A1: Matrixport is concerned about a potential further Bitcoin decline , citing intensified resistance from seasonal factors and a critical technical price range of $106,000-$108,000. Q2: How do seasonal factors affect Bitcoin’s price? A2: Seasonal factors refer to historical patterns where certain periods of the year show weaker performance for assets like Bitcoin, contributing to intensified resistance against price appreciation. Q3: Why is U.S. jobs data important for Bitcoin’s price? A3: U.S. jobs data can significantly impact market volatility and investor sentiment, as it influences expectations for the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and overall economic health, which in turn affects risk assets like Bitcoin. Q4: Are U.S. interest rate cuts always bullish for cryptocurrencies? A4: While U.S. interest rate cuts are generally considered bullish for cryptocurrencies by making borrowing cheaper, Matrixport’s report suggests the process is “unlikely to be smooth,” implying potential volatility and uncertainty during the transition. Q5: What technical level should Bitcoin investors watch? A5: Matrixport identified the $106,000-$108,000 range as a critical technical level. A sustained move below this range could signal further downside potential for Bitcoin. If you found this analysis insightful, please consider sharing it with your network!

The second leg of Lubin’s thesis centered on tokenizing Ethereum’s burn into a transferable primitive dubbed BETH, introduced last week by the Ethereum Community Foundation (ECF). In follow-up posts, Lubin prodded the ecosystem to “dig into all the ramifications of tokenizing and explicitly accounting for burned ETH,” even floating a playful incentive experiment: “Would you burn a bit of ETH for [a @BanklessHQ] episode? … Would some of you send some of that BETH to @BanklessHQ?” Beyond media stunts, he sketched potential demand sinks and governance uses: “Would there be a growing demand for BETH as it takes on signaling and voting power in many different contexts?” Under the ECF design, BETH is an immutable ERC-20 that mints 1:1 when ETH is provably destroyed. The contract forwards deposits to the canonical burn address and issues BETH to the depositor; supply equals cumulative burned ETH by construction, with no admin keys and no redemption path back to ETH. This makes burn—not issuance—the productive act that yields a new asset representing alignment with scarcity. The reference implementation and contract address were published by ECF alongside a blog explainer. Related Reading: Ethereum To $5,500 In Weeks, $12,000 By Year-End, Tom Lee Predicts Lubin then speculated on derivative layers that might emerge on top of BETH—“BBETH, BBBETH, etc.”—as context-specific assets. He analogized this to early “colored coins” on Bitcoin, with a critical distinction: these “shades of BETH” would live natively in Ethereum’s token standards and tooling, eliminating the off-chain recognition problem that stymied first-generation experiments. “One could think of [BBETH/BBBETH] as a more refined element of ‘cracked ETH’… more scarce,” Lubin wrote, suggesting games and other constrained economies as potential testbeds. The near-term market framing came via Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, whose latest public commentary has been notably constructive on Ethereum’s institutional arc. Lee has argued that Wall Street’s operational stack is migrating to blockchains, that ETFs and staking rails provide investable wrappers for compliance-first capital, and that Ethereum could be the “biggest macro trade over the next ten to fifteen years.” Lubin, for his part, said the two “get on calls intermittently” to coordinate strategy in areas of overlap while “competing in highly differentiated ways.” At press time, ETH was trading around $4,399.

The token has been sliding along a descending resistance line since mid-August, with repeated failures near $2.95–$3.00 keeping upside momentum capped.

At the same time, weekly analysts warn that $2.66 and $2.55 represent the next critical support tiers, making this week decisive for bulls attempting to stabilize the market.

OKX has announced that it will start spot trading for WLFI, changing all pre-sale futures into perpetual contracts. According to CoinGlass , the derivative trading volume for WLFI increased by over 530% to over $4.6 billion on Sunday. At the time of writing, open interest is up by over 60% to around $941 million. The derivative opened on August 23 at $0.41 and is currently down at $0.32, but continues to receive vigorous activity.

WLFI token begins trading on Monday, September 1 According to CoinGlass, Binance WLFI derivative trading accounted for the most transactions, with a volume exceeding $2.21 billion over the past 24-hour period. The crypto exchange platform also recorded more than $443 million in open interest. OKX and Bitget exchanges recorded $924 and $648 million in volume, respectively. WLFI is officially coming to @binance the largest crypto exchange in the world 🦅🤝 https://t.co/MnPbpPZPlI — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) September 1, 2025 The WLFI project announced that 20% of the tokens purchased in early fundraising rounds at around $0.015 to $0.05 will be unlocked today via the ‘Lockbox’ process to control how early investors claim and release their tokens. If the current price range holds, early investors accounting for at least 5% of the total supply may receive up to 20 times their initial investments. The Trump family holds 22.5 billion tokens via DEFI LLC, which places them at just over $25.9 million with the current price. The tokens are subject to scrutiny before unlocking. The WLFI token allows holders to stake a yield, vote on proposals, and provide liquidity to DeFi exchanges . It incorporates a fixed supply and deflationary mechanisms that support long-term trading. According to CoinGlass data, at least 14,000 wallets hold the token, showing a growth in interest in the project’s early adoption. Investors await WLFI’s trading debut amid USD1 launch on Solana World Liberty Financial recently revealed its plan to launch a USD1 stablecoin backed by the dollar. WLFI described it as a stablecoin that meets the internet capital markets, and more details will follow soon. The project launched the stablecoin today on Solana with a 1:1 redeemable basis for the U.S. dollar. Abu Dhabi state firm has already committed $2 billion to support the project, showing a growing interest in governments integrating DeFi. Despite the good news surrounding the project, it has attracted scrutiny from rival politicians and watchdogs, who have cited potential conflicts of interest. The Democrats’ proposal to impose restrictions on the GENIUS Act stablecoin bill, which Trump recently signed into law, failed to advance. Cryptopolitan reported that the lawmakers questioned how oversight would be handled as the legislation places USD1 stablecoin regulation under the OCC and Federal Reserve. The Democrat senators posed a warning that the President’s executive order to increase influence over regulators may risk unprecedented outcomes to the American financial system. Investors await the token debut to see how it will test the project’s ability to sustain momentum in the competitive DeFi landscape. Those speculating on the token have already anticipated rewards, with one notable Whale on Hyperliquid, who used three times leverage to make over $1 million in profit from a position of 8.6 million tokens valued at $3.2 million.

Recent reports have shed light on the initial supply of this much-anticipated token, revealing an estimated 6.4 billion WLFI tokens poised for immediate circulation. This figure is crucial for understanding the token’s market entry and its potential impact on the broader crypto landscape. For anyone tracking new crypto ventures, these details offer a vital glimpse into the project’s foundational structure. What’s the Buzz Around the WLFI Token ‘s Initial Supply? According to insights from AmberCN, the initial circulating supply of the WLFI token is estimated at 6.4 billion. This figure represents 6.4% of the project’s total reported supply. Let’s break down how this initial supply is structured: Presale Allocation: 3.4 billion tokens originate from the project’s presale. This amount specifically represents 20% of the 16.9 billion tokens sold during the presale phase that are immediately available for trading. Tokenomics Allocation: An additional 3 billion WLFI tokens (equivalent to 3% of the total supply) have been allocated directly from the project’s overarching tokenomics strategy. This combined approach to initial distribution aims to establish foundational liquidity for the token as it enters the market, influencing its early trading dynamics. Decoding the WLFI Token ‘s Tokenomics: A Closer Look Understanding the tokenomics of any cryptocurrency project is essential, and the WLFI token is no exception. The total supply of WLFI tokens has been previously reported to be a substantial 100 billion. The initial 6.4 billion tokens represent a carefully planned release, designed to balance market availability with long-term project goals. Tokenomics, in simple terms, dictates how tokens are created, distributed, and managed over time. For this asset, the initial release strategy aims to provide sufficient liquidity for early investors while reserving a significant portion for future development and ecosystem growth. The WLFI Token ‘s Journey: Presales and Market Performance The journey of the WLFI token to market has involved two distinct presale phases, each attracting significant interest: First Presale: A substantial 20 billion tokens were sold at an initial price of $0.015 each. This phase allowed early adopters to acquire the asset at a foundational price point. Second Presale: Following the first, another five billion WLFI tokens were made available at $0.05 per token, demonstrating a rising valuation as the project progressed. Currently, the WLFI token is making waves on pre-market futures platforms. It is trading at $0.3250 on Binance’s pre-market futures, indicating a notable increase from its presale prices. This pre-market activity offers a preliminary gauge of market sentiment and investor confidence. What Does the Future Hold for the WLFI Token ? The launch of any new cryptocurrency, especially one with such prominent ties, naturally raises questions about its future trajectory. The initial supply of 6.4 billion WLFI tokens , combined with strong pre-market performance, suggests a project that has captured significant attention. However, like all crypto assets, the WLFI token will face its share of challenges and opportunities. Its long-term success will likely depend on several factors: The utility and adoption of the WorldLibertyFinancial DeFi platform. Ongoing development and innovation by the project team. Community engagement and investor support. For potential investors, conducting thorough due diligence and staying informed about project updates will be paramount to navigating this evolving landscape. Conclusion: The estimated 6.4 billion initial supply of the WLFI token marks a significant milestone for the Trump family’s DeFi project, WorldLibertyFinancial. With a total supply of 100 billion tokens and strong interest evidenced by its presale performance and current pre-market trading, the WLFI token is certainly a project to watch. Its development, utility, and market reception will be key indicators of its long-term viability within the dynamic cryptocurrency space.

Cronos surges on Trump Media backing Cronos saw one of its most dramatic rallies in years, climbing over 100% in the past week as news broke of a Trump Media Group initiative to accumulate significant CRO reserves. A new crypto treasury vehicle backed by $6.4 billion in funding and plans to integrate CRO into its platform sent prices to three-year highs. Despite this surge, technical indicators suggest overbought conditions and potential for a near-term pullback, raising questions about sustainability beyond headline-driven momentum. Pi Coin Holders Pivot From Hype To Utility-Driven Altcoin The brief spotlight on Cronos has also highlighted Pi Coin’s longer road challenges. Pi trading lingers around $0.35 with lacklustre volume, raising concerns about its long-term price stability. In contrast, Remittix offers infrastructure-based growth that resonates with investors seeking substance over speculation. Pi holders, burnt by fading hype cycles, are increasingly gravitating toward ecosystems that offer real-world utility and consistent development. Remittix Outshines Both With Real-World Utility And Rapid Growth In contrast to fleeting rallies like Cronos or stalled projects like Pi Coin, Remittix presents itself as a high conviction option grounded in tangible use cases. Unlike Cronos’ politically driven surge, or Pi Coin’s speculative base, Remittix is purpose-built for payment utility and backed by actual milestones. Remittix is priced at $0.1000 and has announced its first CEX listing on BitMart after reaching $20 million, followed by a second listing on LBANK upon passing the $23 million threshold. A Q3 2025 wallet beta launch is scheduled, and a $250,000 community giveaway is already active. Here is why Remittix stands out: Solving a $19 trillion global payments gap Crypto to bank transfers in 30+ countries Utility first token backed by transaction demand Built for adoption, not speculation Early entry before listings and wider product launch escalates visibility Amid Cronos’ headline-fueled rally and Pi Coin’s plateau, Remittix offers a grounded path forward, combining execution, product rollout, and community incentives into a growth story with real substance. Why Remittix Could Be the Real Winner Beyond Cronos and Pi Coin Cronos’s explosive climb shows how quickly sentiment can turn with headline catalysts, but such momentum often fades as emotions cool. Pi Coin continues to struggle in the shadows of hype cycles. Remittix, by comparison, brings infrastructure, tangible progress, and focused strategy to space. For investors tired of volatility-driven swings, Remittix offers a narrative that may well deliver where others falter, aiming to turn real utility into meaningful returns.

Will There Be Another Leaf Fall? Here Are the Historical Data and Expectations!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-the-bitcoin-doesnt-like-septembers-story-continue-will-there-be-another-leaf-fall-here-are-the-historical-data-and-expectations/,"Bitcoin (BTC) last broke through $124,000 in mid-August, before entering a downtrend. At this point, BTC has fallen below $110,000, with analysts believing the current $107,000-$108,000 levels to be critical for its future price action. While Bitcoin has been unable to escape the downtrend it has entered since reaching a new ATH of $124,000, we have entered September, when the FED is expected to make the first interest rate cut of 2025. At this point, as investors leave their hopes for a rise to the coming days and months, let's take a look at the answers to the questions: “Is Bitcoin liking September? How did it perform in previous Septembers?” How Did Bitcoin Perform in Previous September Months? When we look at Bitcoin's performance over years and months, we notice that declines are concentrated in certain months and increases are concentrated in certain months. When we look at the Bitcoin monthly return chart above, we see that January, March, August and September are generally the months of decline, while February, July, October and November are the months of rise. At this point, when historical data is examined, Bitcoin closed September with an increase in only 4 of the last 12 years, while it closed September with a decrease in the remaining 8 years. According to the data, in September, when BTC closed in the green, the increase rates were small, such as 3.9%, 6% and 7.2%. In the face of these historical data, analysts and investors describe September as the worst-performing month of the year, and it is predicted that September this year will also be a down month. While expectations for a rise are bearish, it's difficult to predict which direction Bitcoin's price will move. The possibility of the Fed cutting interest rates, which have been held steady since the beginning of 2025, in September, and the expectation of seeing an upward trend in BTC and the crypto market with the first interest rate cut of the year, are also high. At this point, some analysts predict that Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market will experience a broader recovery, given the current structure. An analyst with the pseudonym ZYN noted a bullish divergence in the weekly RSI. Accordingly, despite the price pullback, the lack of a similar decline in the RSI suggests buyers are still active in the market. “This data isn't hope, it's reality,” the analyst said. “If the current level holds, a new ATH is on the table within the next 4-6 weeks.” While September is often negative for Bitcoin, historical data suggests that October and the final quarter of the year were strong for Bitcoin. BTC ended the month with an 83% increase. This is why October is known in the markets as the “Uptober” bullish month. *This is not investment advice.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement as the Bitcoin price has once again demonstrated its remarkable volatility and upward potential, breaching the significant $109,000 mark. This impressive surge has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts globally, signaling a potentially robust period for the digital asset market. According to recent market monitoring, Bitcoin has successfully risen above $109,000. On the Binance USDT market, the premier cryptocurrency is currently trading at this elevated level. This milestone represents a considerable gain, sparking renewed interest and speculation across the financial landscape. What’s Driving the Incredible Bitcoin Price Surge? Several factors contribute to such a significant upward movement in the Bitcoin price . Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the dynamic crypto space. Market analysts point to a confluence of events that often fuel these rallies. Institutional Adoption: Increased interest and investment from large financial institutions often provide substantial buying pressure. These entities view Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, integrating it into their portfolios. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, such as inflation concerns or changes in monetary policy, can push investors towards decentralized assets like Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional market uncertainties. Supply Dynamics: Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity, reinforced by events like the halving, limits its supply. When demand outstrips this limited supply, the price naturally climbs. Retail Investor Enthusiasm: A surge in public interest and participation, often fueled by positive news or social media trends, can create a powerful momentum known as ‘FOMO’ (Fear Of Missing Out). Moreover, technological advancements within the Bitcoin ecosystem and growing regulatory clarity in various jurisdictions can bolster investor confidence, contributing to a more stable and attractive environment for investment. Navigating the Volatility: What Does This Bitcoin Price Point Mean for You? While a rising Bitcoin price is exciting, it also brings a degree of volatility that demands careful consideration from investors. This current rally above $109,000 presents both opportunities and challenges. For existing holders, this surge represents a significant increase in their portfolio value. It validates their long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s potential. However, it also prompts questions about profit-taking strategies and rebalancing. For new or potential investors, the elevated price can be a double-edged sword: Opportunity: It signals strong market sentiment and potential for further growth, attracting new capital. Risk: Entering at a high point carries the risk of a market correction, which could lead to short-term losses. Therefore, conducting thorough research and understanding your risk tolerance is paramount. Diversifying your investments and avoiding emotional decisions are key strategies for navigating the unpredictable crypto market. Beyond $109,000: What’s Next for the Bitcoin Price? The journey of Bitcoin price is rarely linear. While reaching $109,000 is a significant achievement, the market will undoubtedly look towards future targets and potential challenges. Analysts are now closely watching for signs of sustained momentum or potential consolidation. Looking ahead, several factors could influence Bitcoin’s trajectory: Sustained Demand: Continued institutional and retail interest will be vital for maintaining upward pressure. Regulatory Developments: Favorable regulations globally could open new avenues for adoption and investment, further stabilizing the market. Technological Upgrades: Enhancements to Bitcoin’s underlying technology, such as scalability solutions, can improve its utility and appeal. Global Economic Outlook: The broader economic landscape will continue to play a role, with Bitcoin often acting as a safe haven during times of uncertainty. Conversely, increased regulatory scrutiny, unexpected macroeconomic downturns, or significant market corrections could pose challenges. However, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated resilience, often recovering strongly from dips. The surge of the Bitcoin price above $109,000 is a compelling reminder of the cryptocurrency’s enduring appeal and its potential to reshape the financial world. While the journey is often marked by volatility, the underlying technology and growing adoption continue to drive its long-term prospects. Staying informed and approaching the market with a well-thought-out strategy remains crucial for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean for Bitcoin to rise above $109,000? A1: This signifies a significant rally and strong market confidence, pushing Bitcoin’s value to a new, impressive milestone within the context of the current market cycle, demonstrating robust demand and investor optimism. Q2: Is this a new all-time high for Bitcoin? A2: While $109,000 represents a substantial increase and a major milestone, its status as an all-time high depends on the specific market conditions at the time of this event. It certainly marks a period of exceptional growth. Q3: What factors are contributing to this Bitcoin price increase? A3: Key factors include increased institutional investment, favorable macroeconomic conditions, Bitcoin’s limited supply dynamics, and renewed enthusiasm from retail investors. Q4: Should I invest in Bitcoin now that its price is so high? A4: Investing always carries risk. It’s crucial to conduct your own research, understand market volatility, and consider your financial goals and risk tolerance. Consulting a financial advisor is also recommended. Q5: How can I monitor the Bitcoin price? A5: You can monitor the Bitcoin price through various cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, crypto news websites, and dedicated market tracking platforms that provide real-time data and analytics. Q6: What are the potential risks associated with Bitcoin’s high price? A6: Risks include market volatility leading to potential corrections, regulatory changes, and the inherent speculative nature of cryptocurrencies. Always invest responsibly.

Key Takeaways: Nike and StockX have settled their trademark dispute, ending a three-year legal battle over sneaker-linked NFTs. The settlement cancels a planned October jury trial, sparing both companies from potential reputational and legal damage. The case underscores growing legal scrutiny of NFTs, especially when brand usage and counterfeit claims are involved. The resolution, filed last Friday in New York federal court , halts a jury trial that had been slated for October and dismisses all claims with prejudice. Nike and StockX Avoid Legal Blow with Last-Minute Settlement The decision spares both companies from a potentially damaging courtroom verdict. For StockX, the settlement eliminates the risk of being found liable for broader misuse of Nike’s brand. For Nike, it avoids the uncertainty of having its IP enforcement strategies scrutinized by a jury. The conflict began in early 2022, when Nike accused the Detroit-based marketplace of trademark infringement over its “Vault” NFTs, which featured Nike sneakers. According to Nike, the tokens misled consumers into thinking the company endorsed or was involved in the digital offerings. StockX countered that the NFTs merely served as digital receipts tied to physical goods, not as standalone products. Tensions escalated in May 2022 when Nike amended its complaint to allege that StockX had also sold counterfeit sneakers. Those claims gained legal weight in March this year, when Judge Valerie Caproni ruled in Nike’s favor on part of the case. The court found StockX liable for selling four fake pairs of Nike shoes to undercover investigators and an additional 33 pairs to a customer. StockX has been found liable for selling counterfeit Nike shoes according to a new court document released today pic.twitter.com/l79KjIiHjF — Ovrnundr (@Ovrnundr) March 4, 2025 The remaining issues were left for a jury, until the parties reached their agreement last week. In December last year, Nike-owned digital fashion and web3 studio RTFKT announced plans to wind down operations. According to an announcement shared on RTFKT’s social media channels, its Web3 services will cease by the end of January 2025 . The company cited a transition to preserving its legacy through an updated website showcasing its previous projects. The company also faced a lawsuit from a group of investors who claimed the company’s abrupt shutdown of its digital collectibles venture, RTFKT, wiped out the value of their purchases and left them facing heavy losses. The Sandbox Founders Exit as Animoca Assumes Full Control As reported, Metaverse platform The Sandbox is undergoing a transformation following the departure of its co-founders and a majority takeover by Animoca Brands. Co-founders Sébastien Borget and Arthur Madrid have stepped back from operational roles, with over half of the company’s workforce also let go. Robby Yung, CEO of Animoca Brands, has been appointed as the new CEO of The Sandbox. Borget remains involved as a public ambassador, while Madrid assumes a non-executive chairman position. Behind the leadership shake-up is growing dissatisfaction with The Sandbox’s performance. Despite raising $300 million over the past eight years, the platform has failed to gain traction among users. Daily active usage reportedly numbers in the low hundreds, with many flagged as bots, particularly from South America. Its native token, SAND, has fallen more than 95% from its 2021 highs, with its market cap plummeting from $8 billion to around $700 million.

Gemini updates their $XRP NYC billboard to “Spend Dollars Earn XRP” Earn XRP every time you swipe your card Introducing the Gemini Credit Card: XRP Edition Apply for The Gemini Credit Card and get an extra $50 in crypto using my Referral https://t.co/mDebSUzjS8 https://t.co/0x2KgBROvP pic.twitter.com/7fDhexIjcs — 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸XRP (@BankXRP) August 31, 2025 The XRP Edition Card On August 25, 2025, Gemini officially unveiled the XRP Edition of its credit card powered by Mastercard. The release confirmed expectations that had been circulating after the company dropped a series of teasers in the lead-up to launch. The XRP Edition is a limited edition metal credit card issued by WebBank, designed specifically for users interested in accumulating XRP. Unlike traditional cashback products that issue rewards in fiat, this card provides direct cashback in XRP, meaning users receive cryptocurrency rewards automatically with every transaction. BankXRP’s post connects this core feature with the broader messaging presented on Gemini’s billboard. Lead-Up and Teaser Campaign Before launch, Gemini set the stage with a sequence of teasers. On August 21, 2025, the company showcased a striking wraparound billboard in New York City , featuring an XRP-branded Mastercard image, the date “8.25.25,” and the line “Issued by WebBank.” That advertisement clearly hinted at the launch date and issuing partner, while also confirming that the product would be structured as a Mastercard credit card. Before this teaser, Gemini had already hinted at an XRP-related release, followed by another teaser referencing Mastercard, signaling that a credit card connected to XRP was imminent. The official unveiling on August 25 confirmed what the advertising campaign had suggested. Advertising and Product Messaging The emphasis of Gemini’s billboard and BankXRP’s tweet is the simplicity of the rewards mechanism: spend dollars and earn XRP. The straightforward wording, “Earn XRP every time you swipe your card,” presents the product directly without additional complexity. The fact that it is a metal card issued by WebBank provides it with the same structure and credibility as other traditional credit cards, but with cryptocurrency at the center of its rewards program. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Designed for XRP Users The XRP Edition is clearly for individuals who want to integrate XRP accumulation into daily spending habits. The billboard placement in New York City underscores Gemini’s effort to give the card prominent visibility while appealing to both existing XRP holders and those who may be drawn to earning cryptocurrency rewards through familiar spending channels. For dedicated XRP users, the product offers a direct way to increase holdings without requiring separate purchases on an exchange, as the rewards are credited automatically in XRP.

The cryptocurrency world is always buzzing with new developments, and one of the most anticipated announcements recently involves the upcoming Binance SOMI listing . Binance, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, has officially revealed that SOMI will be its 35th Hodler Airdrop project. This news has generated significant interest among crypto enthusiasts and investors alike. The official listing is set for 2:30 p.m. UTC on September 2nd, marking a new chapter for the SOMI token and offering a unique opportunity for Binance users. Unveiling the Exciting Binance SOMI Listing This particular Binance SOMI listing is not just a standard addition to the exchange. It’s part of Binance’s innovative Hodler Airdrop program. This initiative rewards users who hold specific cryptocurrencies on the Binance platform. By participating, eligible users receive new tokens like SOMI without needing to purchase them directly. This approach fosters community engagement and provides an additional incentive for long-term holding. Binance selects promising projects for these airdrops. The goal is to support new tokens and benefit existing users. SOMI’s selection highlights its potential within the crypto ecosystem. The announcement came directly from Binance’s official website, emphasizing transparency and reliability. This official communication is crucial for building trust, especially with such a significant event as a new token listing and airdrop. Understanding the Binance Hodler Airdrop Program For many, the concept of a “hodler airdrop” might be new. Essentially, Binance takes snapshots of user balances for specific cryptocurrencies held on their platform. If you meet the criteria for holding the designated assets, you automatically qualify for the airdrop. The SOMI tokens are then distributed directly to your Binance wallet. Eligibility: Users must hold specific cryptocurrencies on Binance. Snapshot: Binance takes random snapshots of user balances to determine eligibility. Distribution: Qualified users receive SOMI tokens directly into their spot wallets. This mechanism ensures that loyal users, or “hodlers,” are rewarded for their commitment. It’s a win-win: new projects gain exposure, and Binance users get free tokens, potentially increasing their portfolio value. The precise details regarding which assets qualify for the SOMI airdrop will be communicated by Binance. Impact of the Binance SOMI Listing on Investors The Binance SOMI listing opens up new avenues for the SOMI token. Listings on major exchanges like Binance often lead to increased liquidity and visibility. This exposure can attract more investors and potentially boost the token’s market activity. For current SOMI holders, this listing is a significant validation of the project’s growth and potential. Increased Visibility: A Binance listing puts SOMI in front of millions of users. Enhanced Liquidity: Easier buying and selling of SOMI on a high-volume exchange. Potential Price Impact: Often, listings can lead to short-term price volatility or long-term growth. However, it is important for investors to conduct their own research (DYOR) before making any investment decisions. While a listing on Binance is a positive step, market dynamics can be unpredictable. Maximizing Your Opportunity with the SOMI Airdrop If you’re interested in benefiting from the Binance SOMI listing and the associated airdrop, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Regularly check Binance’s official announcements for specific eligibility requirements and snapshot dates. Secure Your Assets: Ensure your cryptocurrencies are held in your Binance spot wallet to qualify for the airdrop. Understand the Project: Research SOMI’s fundamentals, use case, and team to make informed decisions. Manage Risk: Be aware of potential market volatility around listing events. This exciting development underscores Binance’s commitment to fostering a dynamic crypto ecosystem. The inclusion of SOMI in the Hodler Airdrop program is a testament to its potential and offers a valuable opportunity for Binance users. In conclusion, the upcoming Binance SOMI listing as part of the 35th Hodler Airdrop program is a noteworthy event for the cryptocurrency community. It not only provides a fantastic opportunity for eligible Binance users to receive SOMI tokens but also significantly enhances SOMI’s market presence. As the September 2nd listing date approaches, staying informed and prepared will be key to making the most of this exciting development. This initiative further solidifies Binance’s role as a leader in supporting innovative projects and rewarding its dedicated user base.

51009629,https://thecoinrise.com/businesses-absorb-bitcoin-at-four-times-the-rate-of-miner-production-in-2025/,1756718849,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/51009629.jpeg,Businesses Absorb Bitcoin at Four Times the Rate of Miner Production in 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/businesses-absorb-bitcoin-at-four-times-the-rate-of-miner-production-in-2025/,"Private companies and public businesses are accumulating Bitcoin at a pace that far exceeds the rate of new supply from miners, raising speculation about a looming supply shock in the cryptocurrency market. Data from River shows that these entities are purchasing nearly four times more BTC daily than what miners are able to generate. According to River, publicly traded Bitcoin treasury firms, along with conventional private businesses, have acquired an average of 1,755 BTC per day in 2025. This is in addition to an average of 1,430 BTC per day absorbed by exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other investment products, while governments have added about 39 BTC daily. Together, this level of institutional absorption significantly overshadows the 450 BTC produced by miners each day. Institutions Outpacing Supply Analysts believe such a mismatch between demand and supply could set the stage for a substantial price surge, should current trends continue. Bitcoin treasury companies alone acquired 159,107 BTC in the second quarter of 2025, bringing total business-held reserves to around 1.3 million BTC. Leading this wave of accumulation is Michael Saylor’s company Strategy, which holds 632,457 BTC in its corporate treasury — the largest known BTC position globally. Adam Livingston, author of The Bitcoin Age and The Great Harvest , noted that Strategy’s massive and consistent buying is “synthetically halving Bitcoin,” referring to the reduced available supply effect usually seen only after programmed halving events. Strategy’s Approach to Buying Bitcoin Despite the scale of its acquisitions, Strategy insists that its purchases are not driving short-term market movements. The company’s corporate treasury officer, Shirish Jajodia, explained that its BTC buying strategy is carefully structured to minimize any impact on spot markets. “Bitcoin’s trading volume is over $50 billion in any 24 hours — that’s huge volume. So, if you are buying $1 billion over a couple of days, it’s not actually moving the market that much,” Jajodia said . He added that most of Strategy’s purchases are made through over-the-counter (OTC) desks, keeping transactions away from public exchanges. Market observers remain divided on whether such sustained accumulation by businesses and institutions will immediately trigger price appreciation. However, with supply tightening and major players signaling long-term commitment, many view the possibility of a future BTC supply shock as increasingly likely.

The proposal has already been endorsed by the corporate body House of Doge, and Spiro is to be the chairperson of the new public company. Trading volume has jumped 45% to $2.58 billion as speculation grows over a possible breakout. Yet while DOGE eyes a move toward $0.30, attention is steadily shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale project already demonstrating significant traction in the DeFi sector. Dogecoin Eyes $0.30 Breakout DOGE price has recovered after facing pressure across the broader crypto market. The rebound from $0.21 has coincided with renewed investor confidence as plans for the Dogecoin Treasury surface. The initiative seeks to pool $200 million, with Spiro leading the charge. While Musk’s official role remains uncertain, his influence on the Dogecoin community is undeniable. Market action shows DOGE consolidating in a symmetrical triangle, suggesting that a sharp breakout is on the horizon. Analysts are pointing to a potential 30% move in either direction. The timing of this recovery is raising questions among investors about what crypto to buy now. Many are weighing DOGE’s near-term upside against the longer-term growth potential of emerging projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale and the tokens are being sold at $0.035. The price has already surged 250 percent since the initial stage of 0.01, which shows a high demand. To date, it has raised $15,220,000 and has 15,880 holders on board. Importantly, Phase 6 is selling out quickly, meaning the chance to buy at this level is narrowing. The price will rise 14.3% to $0.04 once Phase 7 commences. With the starting price set at $0.06, existing purchasers stand to gain between 300% and 500% when trading commences. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a dual lending system combining peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract models. Lenders will have options to earn stable yields from assets such as BTC and ETH, while risk-tolerant investors can negotiate higher returns through lending memecoins like DOGE. In addition, the platform will introduce a stablecoin minted only when loans are issued, then burned upon repayment. This structure is intended to maintain a $1 peg while limiting inflationary risks. Security Strength And Investor Confidence Security is emerging as a central reason investors are paying attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also completed its CertiK audit with high rating of 95.00, which indicates that this company has high capabilities to protect its smart contracts. The project has also introduced a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program introduced in collaboration with CertiK which rewards reports of high and low severity. Participation is also being driven by community incentives. The promotional event conducted by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) includes a chance to win money: a total cash amount of the prizes is $100,000 , and ten participants chosen within the framework of the event will get a grant valued in $10,000 MUTM tokens. The combination of these features and a limited supply cap of 4 billion tokens leads to increased confidence among the early users and reinforces its connection as one of the best cryptos to purchase now. Mutuum Finance Positioned For Growth Presale progress shows that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly advancing toward full capacity. Layer-2 integration is set to lower transaction costs and boost scalability, ensuring the protocol can handle higher volumes efficiently. In addition, the planned beta launch will let early users experience the platform directly, reinforcing engagement before the mainnet goes live. The combination of strong tokenomics, active community incentives, and security credentials is making it stand out as the next crypto to hit $1. Looking Ahead Dogecoin may be striving for a $0.30 breakout, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building the structural support needed to deliver sustainable long-term gains. The presale window at $0.035 is closing fast, and early buyers are setting themselves up for significant returns once trading begins. For those asking what crypto to invest in during 2025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is increasingly difficult to overlook.

Ethereum’s ETH/BTC ratio recovery could signal the start of a broader rotation. Cronos (CRO) surged 110% on major partnership news, breaking key resistance levels.

Bitcoin dominance is starting to fade and the ETH/BTC ratio is recovering, a classic setup that historically signals the start of a major capital rotation into altcoins. Bitcoin dominance has begun to ease, often a sign that capital is moving into other assets. The last time a similar setup appeared was in 2021, ahead of a major rally in alternative tokens.

At the time of publication, Samsung shares slid more than 3% in the last 24 hours to 67,600 KRW. SK Hynix shares also dropped nearly 5% during the same period to 256,250 KRW. U.S. ruling impacts sales of semiconductor equipment to China The Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security said it does not intend to grant licenses to expand capacity or upgrade technology at fabs in China. Both Samsung and SK Hynix have several memory plants in Korea, while Beijing also accounts for a major slice of both Korean companies’ global output. Samsung manufactures nearly 40% of its total NAND flash memory chips at its production plant in Xi’an, Shaanxi. SK Hynix also produces 20% of its NAND flash chips in Dalian, Liaoning, and roughly 40% of its DRAM in Wuxi, Jiangsu. In 2023, the former-President Biden’s administration granted the duo the ability to operate in China under regulations allowing them to import semiconductor equipment without applying for a new license. The Trump administration seeks to overturn what’s known as the validated end user (VEU) rules. The Commerce Department said on Friday that the companies will now need to obtain licenses to export their technology to China, but will not be granted licenses to expand capacity or upgrade technology. As recently reported by Cryptopolitan, both firms have 120 days until the waiver expires. “The Trump administration is committed to closing export control loopholes – particularly those that put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage.” – Jeffrey Kessler , Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security. Samsung Executive Chairman Jay Lee was also asked on Sunday about the impact of the new ruling on its Chinese business and argued that the company will have to work hard. South Korea’s government said the stability of the global semiconductor supply chain depends on the stable operation of its semiconductor companies in Beijing. The government also promised to continue discussions with the U.S. to mitigate the impact on South Korean Companies. A spokesperson for Beijing’s commerce ministry said China opposes the new U.S. ruling. The agency also said it will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of its enterprises. U.S. ruling comes amid heightened U.S. trade policies The new U.S. measures came amid heightened U.S. trade policies that have disrupted global trade for the better part of the year. The U.S. Commerce Department hinted in June at the possibility of revoking the rules, after a White House official said the U.S. was preparing in case the truce in trade talks with South Korea fell apart. The U.S. and South Korea agreed on a 15% levy on Seoul imports to the U.S. from August 7. China and the U.S. also agreed on 30% tariffs on Chinese imports to the U.S. and 10% levies on U.S. goods till November. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, the country’s trade minister, Yeo Han-koo, also said both Samsung and SK Hynix are exempted from 100% U.S. levies on semiconductor equipment. Chris Miller, the author of ‘Chip War,’ argued that the U.S. measures will make it harder for Korean chipmakers with facilities in China to continue producing more advanced chips. He also believes that the move risks opening market space for Chinese firms at the expense of the Korean firms if the measure isn’t accompanied by further steps against Chinese chipmakers.

South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb recently announced a significant, albeit temporary, suspension. Starting at 9:00 a.m. UTC on September 3, users will temporarily be unable to deposit or withdraw Stellar (XLM) and AQUA. This crucial step is being taken to facilitate an essential Stellar network upgrade . Understanding these temporary changes is vital for all involved in the Stellar ecosystem. What’s Happening with the Stellar Network Upgrade? Bithumb’s decision directly supports an upcoming Stellar network upgrade . Network upgrades are common in the cryptocurrency world. They are vital for enhancing the blockchain’s performance, security, and functionality. Think of it like a software update for your phone – it brings new features and fixes old bugs. During this period, specifically for XLM and AQUA, Bithumb will halt deposit and withdrawal services. This ensures the safety and integrity of user funds during the technical transition. It’s a proactive measure to prevent any potential issues that could arise from transactions made during the upgrade window. Why is Bithumb Suspending Services for the Stellar Network Upgrade? Exchanges like Bithumb play a critical role in facilitating these network improvements. When a blockchain undergoes a significant upgrade, it often requires a temporary pause in related services. This ensures that all systems are aligned with the new protocol. Without such precautions, there’s a risk of transaction errors or even loss of funds. By suspending deposits and withdrawals, Bithumb minimizes risks for its users. This allows the exchange to thoroughly test and integrate the upgraded Stellar network. Their priority is to ensure a smooth transition and the secure handling of your assets once the upgrade is complete. This temporary inconvenience is a small price for long-term network health and security. What Does This Stellar Network Upgrade Mean for You? For Bithumb users holding XLM or AQUA, the primary impact is the inability to move these assets on or off the exchange during the specified time. However, it’s important to note that trading of XLM and AQUA on Bithumb is generally expected to continue uninterrupted. Your funds remain safe within the exchange’s custody. Here’s what you should consider: Plan Ahead: If you need to deposit or withdraw XLM or AQUA, ensure you do so before the September 3 deadline. Stay Informed: Always monitor official announcements from Bithumb and the Stellar Development Foundation for real-time updates. No Panic: This is a standard procedure for network improvements, not a sign of instability. This temporary halt is a necessary step towards a more robust and efficient Stellar ecosystem. Users should see this as an investment in the future of the network. Ensuring Smooth Transitions After the Stellar Network Upgrade Once the Stellar network upgrade is successfully implemented, Bithumb will meticulously monitor the network’s stability. They will then announce the resumption of deposit and withdrawal services for XLM and AQUA. This post-upgrade monitoring period is crucial to confirm everything is operating as expected. It’s always advisable for users to exercise caution immediately after services resume. Check Bithumb’s official channels for confirmation before attempting any transactions. This proactive approach helps in navigating such technical transitions smoothly and safely. In conclusion, Bithumb’s temporary suspension of XLM and AQUA deposits and withdrawals is a standard, yet crucial, step to support the upcoming Stellar network upgrade . This measure prioritizes user security and ensures the long-term health and efficiency of the Stellar blockchain. While it requires a brief adjustment, the benefits of a stronger, more capable network will undoubtedly outweigh the temporary inconvenience. Stay informed, plan accordingly, and look forward to the enhanced capabilities that this upgrade will bring to the Stellar ecosystem.

After a brief pause, digital asset funds are once again experiencing a remarkable surge in net inflows, with a clear leader emerging from the pack. Investors are pouring back into the market, and the spotlight is firmly on Ethereum inflows , which are significantly outperforming other cryptocurrencies. What’s Driving the Surge in Ethereum Inflows? Last week, digital asset investment products collectively saw an impressive $2.48 billion in net inflows, according to a recent report by CoinShares. This marks a strong rebound following a single week of outflows, signaling renewed investor confidence across the market. The standout performer in this resurgence was undoubtedly Ethereum. Ethereum investment products alone attracted a staggering $1.4 billion in inflows, showcasing robust and sustained interest. In comparison, Bitcoin products also saw healthy net inflows of $748 million, contributing significantly to the overall positive sentiment. This data highlights a clear shift in investor preference and strategic allocation within the crypto space. Why Are Digital Asset Funds Seeing a Resurgence? The return to positive flows for digital asset funds suggests a broader market optimism. Several factors could be at play, including a more stable macroeconomic environment, growing institutional acceptance, and anticipation of future regulatory clarity. This consistent demand for digital asset products, particularly those offering exposure to major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin, underscores their increasing role in diversified investment portfolios. Investors are clearly looking beyond short-term volatility, focusing on the long-term potential these assets offer. The substantial Ethereum inflows specifically indicate a strong belief in its ecosystem and upcoming developments, such as scaling solutions and further decentralization. Comparing Ethereum and Bitcoin: A Shifting Landscape for Inflows? When we look at the monthly trends for August, the picture becomes even clearer regarding the leadership of Ethereum inflows . Ethereum products recorded a colossal $3.95 billion in net inflows over the month, painting a vivid picture of sustained and substantial investor interest. In stark contrast, Bitcoin products experienced net outflows totaling $301 million during the same period. This divergence is noteworthy and suggests that while Bitcoin remains the largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum is increasingly capturing a larger share of new investment capital into digital asset funds . This trend could indicate a growing appreciation for Ethereum’s utility, smart contract capabilities, and its role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT sectors. Actionable Insights for Investors: What Do These Inflows Mean? For investors, these significant Ethereum inflows offer valuable insights into current market sentiment and potential future trends: Increased Confidence: The strong return to positive flows indicates a healthy appetite for digital assets, suggesting that market participants view recent price corrections as buying opportunities rather than a sign of long-term decline. Ethereum’s Momentum: Ethereum’s consistent leadership in inflows points to its growing prominence and potential as a long-term investment. Its ecosystem continues to innovate, attracting both retail and institutional capital. Diversification Strategy: While Bitcoin remains crucial, the data emphasizes the importance of a diversified approach within the crypto portfolio, with Ethereum playing an increasingly vital role. Market Sentiment Indicator: Positive inflows often precede periods of price appreciation, though past performance is not indicative of future results. It signals robust demand and a potentially bullish outlook. Understanding these dynamics is key to navigating the evolving digital asset landscape effectively. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Asset Funds The recent data from CoinShares paints a compelling picture of renewed investor confidence in the digital asset space, spearheaded by impressive Ethereum inflows . The substantial capital flowing into Ethereum investment products, coupled with positive but comparatively smaller Bitcoin inflows, highlights a dynamic and maturing market. As digital asset funds continue to attract significant capital, it underscores the growing mainstream acceptance and long-term potential of cryptocurrencies. This trend signals an exciting period for the digital asset ecosystem, with Ethereum at the forefront of this financial resurgence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are digital asset funds? Digital asset funds are investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies and other digital assets without directly owning them. They are typically structured as trusts or exchange-traded products (ETPs), making crypto investing more accessible. Why are Ethereum inflows considered so significant? Significant Ethereum inflows suggest strong investor belief in Ethereum’s long-term value, its pivotal role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and its ongoing technological advancements like scaling solutions. How do these inflows compare to Bitcoin’s recent performance? While Bitcoin also saw positive weekly inflows, Ethereum’s weekly and monthly inflows were substantially higher, indicating a current preference for Ethereum among investors allocating to digital asset funds. This highlights a divergence in short-term capital allocation. Does this trend guarantee Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin? Not necessarily, but strong Ethereum inflows do indicate a robust and growing interest in Ethereum as an investment. Market performance is influenced by many factors beyond just inflows, but they are a positive indicator of demand. Where can I find reliable reports on digital asset fund flows? Reports on digital asset fund flows are regularly published by reputable firms like CoinShares, providing valuable insights into institutional and professional investor sentiment and market trends.

But the most compelling story lies in its burgeoning data center business. Lots of upside on the table for those willing to stomach execution risks. Galaxy Digital ( GLXY ) , one of the more diverse cryptocurrency conglomerates out there, has notched milestone after milestone since its reverse takeover launch in 2018 by founder/CEO Michael Novogratz. The latest of these include an NASDAQ uplisting earlier this year (note GLXY is also traded over-the-counter ( BRPHF ) and via its Canadian listing (GLXY:CA)), as well as a data center pivot at its Helios facility in West Texas. Both factors underpinned GLXY’s scorching triple-digit % run over the last year. Data by YCharts Today, GLXY’s core business segment is “Digital Assets,” under which Global Markets (investment banking, trading, and prime brokerage) and Asset Management & Infrastructure (exchange-traded funds, alternatives, and staking services) sit. Then comes Treasury & Corporate, which comprises GLXY’s on-balance sheet digital asset holdings and investments. Depending on the broader crypto cycle, Treasury & Corporate can swing between a majorly positive (upcycle) or negative (downcycle) P&L driver. Galaxy Digital Last but not least is data centers, where GLXY has parked its AI data center operation (repurposed from bitcoin mining). While this is a potential ‘crown jewel’ asset, it is only set for revenue generation “in the first half of 2026.” Still, if GLXY makes good on its data center promise, this is a stock poised to benefit from two of the ‘hottest’ megatrends today - digital assets and artificial intelligence. Having also pulled back since its July highs, despite a very solid Q2 report, GLXY is well worth a closer look. Data by YCharts A Strong Q2 For Digital Assets On a headline basis, GLXY ticked a lot of boxes in Q2. For one, the company was in the black for a change - from the gross profit ($299m) and adj. EBITDA ($211m) lines, all the way down to net income ($30.7m). But beneath the hood, this was almost entirely down to its digital asset holdings, which appreciated significantly during the quarter. Galaxy Digital A s for the operating performance, Digital Assets, the only revenue-generating segment currently, offered a few positives as well. Leading the way was Global Markets, where gross profit increased +28% quarter-on-quarter – impressively, against a backdrop of lower trading volumes across the industry. Other highlights were GLXY’s loan book reaching a record ~$1.1bn on “continued demand for margin lending and a growing client base,” as well as its role in the Bitstamp-Robinhood deal on the investment banking side. Galaxy Digital Seemingly less positive within Digital Assets was the Asset Management & Infrastructure Solutions sub-segment, where headline gross profit declined on “lower industry-wide onchain activity.” Digging deeper, the biggest drag was Solana, where GLXY is among the largest staking infrastructure providers. Galaxy Digital While negative at first glance, a lot of the quarter-on-quarter delta was really down to the base effect ( “first half of this year was coming off of a pretty aggressive, localized volume on Solana for things like meme coin launches”) rather than any structural weakness in the staking business. With GLXY also making further progress on custodial integration (e.g., Fireblocks in Q2) and benefiting from a rapidly growing “assets on platform” base, it was really a good quarter all around. Galaxy Digital Also Trending Strongly Into Early Q3 From here, things are shaping up very well for Digital Assets – per management, “July looks by all accounts the best month we’ve had at Galaxy” . Global Markets was the key reason for this, having completed a >$9bn block trade (“one of the largest Bitcoin trades in history” ) – testament to GLXY’s execution capabilities. Meanwhile, a combination of “net inflows” into Asset Management and “organic growth in staking assets” for Infrastructure Solutions, in line with the big rally in ETH, also bodes well for Q3. The big opportunity, though, lies in the “phenomenon of balance sheet companies” (a la Strategy (MSTR)). There aren’t many crypto investment bank/asset management platforms out there at all, so GLXY has a big edge in servicing this growing ecosystem. Momentum has only been accelerating - GLXY has already partnered with “over 20 of those companies” as of Q2, with a lot more to come now that regulatory hurdles are cleared. Of note, management called out “one of the strongest institutional onboarding pipelines we have seen to date” . Galaxy Digital Pondering Data Center Upside Post Phase 3 Option The Data Center segment remains non-revenue generating but no less important. The focus here is entirely on its Helios facility in West Texas. Previously acquired in 2022 for $65m for bitcoin mining, GLXY is transitioning this site into a high-performance data center to capture rapidly growing AI-driven demand for compute. As things stand, GLXY has approval for 800 MW of power from the Texas grid operator, ERCOT, and a combined 2,700MW “under various stages of study” . Galaxy Digital The project is split into three phases - Phase 1 (133MW of critical IT), Phase 2 (260MW of critical IT), and Phase 3 (133MW of critical IT). Following anchor tenant CoreWeave’s ( CRWV ) decision to exercise its Phase 3 option, all of the approved site capacity is now contracted. Delivery, on the other hand, is some way off. Phase 1, previously a bitcoin mining facility, is currently being retrofitted and is targeted to go live throughout H1 2026 ( “in various tranches” ). Phase 2 is a greenfield development that hasn’t yet entered the construction phase, but is targeted to go live in 2027. It’s early days for Phase 3, but for now, management has guided to 2028 delivery. Galaxy Digital On paper, the expansion capacity of the site (up to 3,500MW or “one of the largest AI data center campuses in the world” ) could mean a lot of value creation potential. But financing all of this will be tricky. Yes, GLXY does have >$2.6bn of equity, but it doesn’t have a consistently cash-generative business to fall back on. Also, a lot of its assets are tied up in digital assets and investments. If we were to isolate funding available for immediate drawdown (i.e., cash & stablecoins), capacity is closer to $1.2bn. Note also that this includes the ~$480m raised when GLXY uplisted in May. Galaxy Digital Then, there are some fairly hefty capex requirements. Phase 1 will cost $11–13m per MW, with Phase 2 “slightly higher than the Phase 1 on a per-megawatt basis” ; combined, this could run GLXY well over $4bn. There’s also Phase 3, which, assuming similar economics as Phase 1, could add another ~$1.7bn capex burden. Now, GLXY is responsible for funding all the capex, but clearly won’t be able to cover it all solely with cash & equivalents. Thus, the financing structure, whether through debt or project-level equity financing, will be key. So will the financing costs; considering the risk profile of CRWV and the fact that this is a higher risk build, expect Phase 2 (greenfield) debt financing to run a lot higher than the SOFR + 4.75% for Phase 1 . Against all these costs and incremental risks is the earnings upside, which is also quite substantial. Per the fifteen-year lease agreement terms with CRWV for Phases 1,2, and 3 (526 MW of critical IT load), average annual revenue will run at >$1bn (plus ~3% annual escalations). Meanwhile, EBITDA margins are guided to pace at 90% - very feasible, since operating expenses (excluding GLXY personnel) will be covered by CRWV. Galaxy Digital So, at peak, there’s potential for Data Center to generate >$900bn of EBITDA. Conservatively tacking on a below peer average ~20x multiple, this would imply >$18bn of incremental enterprise value. Even netting out a $5-6bn development outlay and assuming steep Phase 2 financing terms, GLXY should, if the execution goes to plan, come out well ahead. Data by YCharts Of course, there are risks here. For starters, Data Center economics rests on the assumption that AI demand is here to stay and that CRWV, its only tenant, will be able to honor its lease obligations. Also, valuation-wise, the business has terminal value. Last but not least, GLXY, a company with no prior experience building out data centers, will get through without significant delays or cost overruns.

51010390,570536,1756720148,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51010390.jpeg,American Bitcoin : les fils Trump visent Wall Street,https://bitcoinist.com/american-bitcoin-trump-wall-street/,"Le mois d’août 2025 s’achève avec une nouvelle secousse dans l’univers Bitcoin . American Bitcoin , soutenue par Donald Trump Jr. et Eric Trump , prépare son entrée en bourse . Une fusion stratégique avec Gryphon Digital Mining doit conduire à une cotation dès septembre. Pour la première fois , une entreprise minière liée directement au président américain se retrouve au cœur des marchés financiers traditionnels. Ce n’est pas seulement un signe de confiance, c’est une démonstration de puissance . Une cotation qui change la donne pour Bitcoin Nous savons que les sociétés de minage sont déjà présentes en bourse, certaines depuis des années. Mais l’irruption d’American Bitcoin a une saveur particulière. Elle conjugue deux éléments puissants : le poids d’un nom qui pèse politiquement, et le timing d’un marché en plein retour de flamme. Le Nasdaq s’apprête à accueillir une société dont le capital sera majoritairement contrôlé par Hut 8 , géant du secteur. Les Trump , eux, deviennent la vitrine médiatique d’une industrie qu’on disait fragile après l’hiver crypto. Cette cotation s’inscrit dans une logique de normalisation. Bitcoin n’est plus un actif périphérique, c’est un secteur qui s’invite dans le cœur de Wall Street . Et ce mouvement change radicalement la perception des grands investisseurs. Pour les fonds, c’est l’occasion d’entrer par la porte institutionnelle. Pour le marché, c’est une validation qui renforce l’idée que Bitcoin n’est plus une expérimentation, mais un pilier financier . Bitcoin sous le prisme institutionnel Nous constatons depuis plusieurs mois une accélération. L’arrivée massive des ETF Bitcoin a transformé le marché en profondeur, amenant une nouvelle génération d’investisseurs à traiter Bitcoin comme un actif classique. L’entrée en bourse d’American Bitcoin vient compléter ce tableau. Elle signifie que le minage, activité centrale de la sécurisation du réseau, devient lui aussi un produit d’investissement reconnu. Cela produit un effet miroir : d’un côté, la spéculation sauvage continue d’exister sur les plateformes décentralisées. De l’autre, les grandes structures financières intègrent désormais Bitcoin dans leurs schémas d’allocation. Entre les deux, un espace s’ouvre. C’est ici que se jouent les opportunités les plus explosives . Après Bitcoin, le moment des petites capitalisations Nous devons être lucides. Quand les grandes entreprises s’installent, le champ devient favorable aux projets émergents capables de surfer sur cette vague de légitimation. C’est là que réside la clé pour réaliser des multiples, bien au-delà de ce que peut offrir un géant coté. Bitcoin a ouvert la voie , les institutions confirment, et les petits acteurs construisent des récits capables de séduire une communauté mondiale. Parmi eux, Bitcoin Hyper s’impose déjà comme l’un des projets les plus prometteurs. Ne laissez pas passer l’occasion de rejoindre un projet qui incarne cette nouvelle génération. Entrez dès la prévente de Bitcoin Hyper . Participez à la prévente de $HYPER ! Bitcoin Hyper, un projet aligné sur l’avenir de Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper n’est pas un simple meme coin . Il reprend l’énergie virale de ces tokens communautaires, mais l’associe à une ambition technique réelle. Le projet construit un Layer 2 sur Bitcoin , utilisant la Solana Virtual Machine pour apporter ce que le réseau originel n’a jamais permis : la rapidité, la programmabilité, la scalabilité. Avec son pont natif, Bitcoin peut être verrouillé sur la couche principale et réémis sur Bitcoin Hyper , où il devient utilisable pour des smart contracts, de la DeFi, des NFT ou encore des dApps. En d’autres termes, ce que les institutions commencent à reconnaître comme un actif de réserve prend ici une dimension pratique, fluide, adaptée à l’économie numérique qui se dessine. Aujourd’hui, plus de 12,7 millions de dollars ont déjà été levés dans la prévente. Une des meilleures préventes du marché. Le prix actuel est fixé à 0,012825 $ , encore accessible pour les premiers participants. La dynamique est forte, et l’appétit pour $BEST ne cesse de croître. Profitez donc, dès maintenant, d’une fenêtre d’entrée idéale, directement en presale et au meilleur prix. Participez à la prévente de $HYPER ! Une mécanique incitative et cohérente Bitcoin Hyper , ce n’est pas seulement une vision technique. A compter parmi les meilleurs ICO , le projet offre des rendements exceptionnels. Premièrement à ceux qui stakent leurs tokens dès les premières phases. Deuxièmement, potentiellement à ceux qui holderont après le listing . Ces APY incitatifs réduisent l’offre en circulation. Et cela favorise la stabilité du prix. L’objectif est clair. Il s’agit de consolider une base d’investisseurs fidèles , capables de soutenir le développement de l’écosystème. Et ce, sur le long terme. C’est une logique “simple et efficace”. Elle tranche radicalement avec le chaos habituel des meme coins. Ici, la communauté se structure autour d’un projet ambitieux, porté par une feuille de route crédible . Testnet, mainnet, déploiement d’un écosystème DeFi et NFT, gouvernance DAO. Ce n’est pas une simple promesse de hype, c’est une vision technique, économique et communautaire . Quand l’institutionnel rencontre l’innovation Nous voyons donc se dessiner une convergence. D’un côté, des entreprises comme American Bitcoin , cotées et régulées, qui renforcent l’image d’un Bitcoin solide et institutionnalisé. De l’autre, des projets comme Bitcoin Hyper , jeunes, explosifs, alignés sur cette dynamique, mais capables de générer des retours incomparables. C’est précisément ce mélange qui fait la force de ce marché . Les grandes structures créent la légitimité. Les petites capitalisations captent l’énergie et la transforment en croissance fulgurante. Un timing historique American Bitcoin , soutenue par la famille Trump , ne fera qu’accentuer la légitimité du minage et du réseau dans son ensemble. Mais pour vous, l’opportunité se joue ailleurs. Dans ces projets émergents, encore sous les radars, mais qui bénéficient déjà d’une traction communautaire et d’un ancrage technologique solide. Bitcoin Hyper est de ceux-là . C’est aujourd’hui, à 0,012825 $ le token , qu’il faut agir. Demain, il sera trop tard . Saisissez votre chance et placez-vous au cœur de ce qui pourrait devenir l’un des mouvements les plus marquants de l’histoire de Bitcoin , avec ce layer 2 déjanté mais très innovant !

Monthly ROC remains flat, suggesting DOGE’s next major bull cycle has not started yet. $0.23 remains a key breakout level; analysts see potential for short-term upside if breached. Ichimoku Chart Shows Weak Bearish Signal Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading in a consolidation zone with mixed signals across different timeframes. While short-term indicators suggest downward pressure, longer-term analysis shows that the current cycle’s major upward move has not started. At press time, DOGE was trading at $0.21, down 3% over the past 24 hours and 6% for the week. According to Trader Tardigrade, the daily Ichimoku chart has shown a weak bearish Tenkan-sen/Kijun-sen cross above the Kumo cloud as of August 31. The price remains within the Kumo, suggesting continued consolidation . Support is located at $0.21517, with resistance at $0.22194 and $0.22444, based on the top of the Kumo and the Kijun-sen line. #Dogecoin Ichimoku Daily Analysis for Trading (as of 31 Aug close) New Signal: – Tenkan-sen/Kijun-sen Cross: Weak bearish cross above Kumo (cloud) on 31/8 Comment: $DOGE remains within the Kumo, indicating consolidation.

The green Kumo indicates a longer-term bullish bias, but the short-term trend shows a downtrend, and the mid-term is flat. Noting the importance of how the price behaves around the current cloud structure, Tardigrade said, “A weak bearish Tenkan-sen/Kijun-sen Cross signals a short setup.” Monthly Chart Shows Bull Run Has Yet to Start On the monthly chart, the Rate of Change (ROC) indicator is flat. According to Trader Tardigrade, this suggests that the macro-level bull cycle has not begun. Past rallies in 2017 and 2021 were preceded by sharp ROC spikes. No such move is present at this time. Remarkably, the chart marks a projected future zone where momentum could return. “The #Dogecoin Rate of Change (ROC) indicator on the monthly chart reveals that the bull run for this cycle hasn’t started yet,” said Tardigrade. Triangle Pattern Signals Breakout Watch Near $0.23 Analyst Ali Martinez reports that DOGE is forming a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart. The price has been consolidating since late July. A break above $0.23 could trigger a short-term rally, with projected resistance levels at $0.2431, $0.2596, $0.2823, and $0.3140. Source: Ali Martinez/X Support remains at $0.2217 and $0.21. Until a breakout occurs, price action is expected to stay range-bound. “Break $0.23 and a new bull rally begins,” Martinez said. The post Dogecoin (DOGE) Enters Weak Downtrend?

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is now weighing moves to calm markets after a brutal August saw the 10-year benchmark yield climb nearly 20 basis points, data from Bloomberg showed. Traders blamed a mix of fiscal pressure, tax cuts announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the fading chance of a near-term rate cut following better-than-expected growth numbers. Analysts believe the RBI may step in by buying government securities in the secondary market or by rejecting bids at auctions. A. Prasanna, chief economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership, said the RBI “should be somewhat worried about the pace of rise in yields,” adding that it “can give soft signals like statements or marginal screen purchases to ensure smooth functioning of the bond market.” Prasanna pointed to open market operations as the likely first step. RBI weighs auction rejections as pressure builds Nathan Sribalasundaram, analyst at Nomura Holdings, said the RBI could also allow the call rate to ease, improving carry for bond investors. He added: “Support could come from an adjustment to the supply. Near term, bids could be rejected at the bond auctions.” The central bank hasn’t officially commented on any of the proposals, and a spokesperson did not respond to requests for input. Government spending numbers released Friday showed India’s fiscal deficit has already hit 30% of the full-year target within the first four months through July, almost double last year’s pace of 17%. That growing gap is pushing up borrowing costs across the board. The damage has already started spilling into the private sector. Companies like Bajaj Finance and Housing and Urban Development Corp. (HUDCO) have shelved plans for fresh bond sales, local media reported. With borrowing costs rising and demand collapsing, firms are now sitting out. The yield-repo spread, the difference between the 10-year bond yield and the central bank’s benchmark rate, has also widened to its highest level in over two years, according to analysts at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ). That suggests tighter financial conditions ahead, even before any new shocks from tariffs or policy changes. And as bond yields climb, liquidity gets more expensive, leaving both government and private borrowers squeezed. Rupee under fire, traders see more pain The Indian rupee is under serious pressure too. It closed at a record low of 88.3075 per dollar on Friday and is expected to stay weak on Monday. The one-month non-deliverable forward hinted at a small move from Friday’s level of 88.1950, but traders warned the breach of the 88 barrier has already given speculators more room to attack. A senior treasury official at a mid-sized private sector bank said the RBI likely held back from defending the rupee more aggressively after nearly $950 million in foreign equity outflows hit the market on Friday. That, plus strong dollar demand from importers and concerns tied to U.S. tariffs, likely pushed the RBI to allow the drop. This comes as global bond markets are also under strain. In the euro zone, long-dated bond yields rose sharply on Monday, with Germany’s 30-year yield climbing to 3.378%, the highest since August 2011. Yields in France and the Netherlands moved in sync with Germany’s, also hitting 14-year highs. Data showed August brought the biggest monthly jump in long-dated euro debt in five months. Over in the U.S., the 30-year Treasury yield rose 4 basis points on Friday before the Labor Day holiday shuttered markets on Monday. Germany’s 10-year yield, seen as the benchmark for euro zone bonds, rose to 2.75%, while France’s equivalent climbed to 3.53%. The spread between the two widened to 78 basis points, the highest since April, as political risks in France weighed on investor confidence. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde addressed those concerns on Monday, saying she was “looking very attentively” at the widening French bond spreads, but added that France was not yet in a position that would require IMF intervention.

To this end, a crypto investor using the Ethereum ( ETH ) domain trumpisthebest.eth has turned a $347,000 bet on WLFI into an unrealized gain of more than $8 million, according to the latest on-chain data retrieved by Finbold from Lookonchain on September 1. Blockchain records indicate that the wallet spent USDC, USDT, and Ethereum approximately 224 days ago to acquire roughly 23.14 million WLFI tokens. At current market valuations, that stash is now worth about $8.5 million, representing a paper return of nearly 25 times the initial investment. A Trump supporter registered the domain ""trumpisthebest.eth"" and spent $347K to buy 23.14M $WLFI ($8.5M now), and is now sitting on an unrealized profit of over $8M. https://t.co/Hd01EQXtKy pic.twitter.com/xA144ptaCJ — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 1, 2025 WLFI unlock The timing of the purchase appears prescient. WLFI, tied to Trump family business interests, has gained traction as it prepared for its September 1 unlock. Ahead of the event, the project saw a sharp increase in derivatives activity. Over the past 24 hours, WLFI derivatives volume surged 535% to $4.54 billion, while open interest climbed 45% to $887 million, according to Coinglass. Binance led trading with $2.22 billion in volume, nearly half the total. The unlock will release 20% of early investor allocations, equal to 5% of the 100 billion token supply. Early buyers, who paid between $0.015 and $0.05 per token, now sit on paper gains of up to 20x at current prices of $0.32–$0.34. It’s worth noting that WLFI raised $550 million across two funding rounds. Tokens will be distributed through a “Lockbox” process with further vesting to limit volatility. Binance has confirmed it will list WLFI spot pairs at 13:00 UTC on September 1, alongside other global exchanges, a move likely to increase interest around the token.

Historically, September has proven to be a challenging month for the leading digital asset, leading to a growing sense of investor caution. This seasonal pattern, coupled with current market dynamics, suggests that Bitcoin could be heading for a significant retest of its crucial support levels. Why Does Bitcoin Face Seasonal September Weakness? For over a decade, September has held a unique reputation in the Bitcoin market. CoinDesk reported that Bitcoin (BTC) has, on average, experienced a decline of 6% during September over the past 12 years. This consistent trend is not just a coincidence; it reflects a confluence of factors that typically converge at this time of year. Historical Patterns: Many assets, including traditional stocks, often see increased volatility or profit-taking after the summer months. Bitcoin, despite its unique characteristics, sometimes follows broader market sentiment. Institutional Rebalancing: Towards the end of the third quarter, institutional investors may rebalance portfolios, which can lead to selling pressure on riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: September often brings renewed focus on economic data and central bank policies following the summer break, contributing to cautious investor behavior. Understanding this historical context is crucial for investors navigating the current market. While past performance is never an absolute indicator of future results, it provides a valuable lens through which to view potential short-term movements. Is a $100,000 Retest Inevitable Amidst Bitcoin September Weakness? The possibility of Bitcoin retesting the $100,000 support level is a significant concern for many market participants. This isn’t just a psychological milestone; it represents a strong technical floor that, if breached, could signal further downside. Several factors are currently influencing this potential retest. One major driver of concern is the continued outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs. These exchange-traded funds, once hailed as a catalyst for institutional adoption, have recently seen more money leaving than entering. This sustained selling pressure indicates a reduction in demand from a key segment of the market, putting downward pressure on BTC’s price. However, the market is not without its potential mitigating factors. A potential interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve could inject fresh liquidity into the financial system. Such a move would typically be bullish for risk assets, including Bitcoin, potentially offsetting some of the selling pressure associated with the historical Bitcoin September weakness and ETF outflows. The interplay between these opposing forces will likely determine whether the $100,000 level holds firm. Navigating the Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Investors In a period marked by historical trends and current market pressures, informed decision-making is paramount. Investors need to be vigilant and adaptable to navigate the potential challenges that September might bring. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor ETF Flows Closely: Keep a close eye on the daily inflow and outflow data for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Sustained outflows signal continued selling pressure, while a reversal could indicate renewed interest. Track Macroeconomic Signals: Pay attention to announcements from the U.S. Federal Reserve regarding interest rates and inflation data. These decisions have a significant impact on investor appetite for risk assets. Utilize Technical Analysis: Identify key support and resistance levels beyond the $100,000 mark. Understanding these technical indicators can help in making timely entry and exit decisions. Practice Risk Management: Consider reducing position sizes or employing dollar-cost averaging strategies to mitigate potential losses during volatile periods. Diversification across different asset classes can also be beneficial. Stay Informed: Rely on reputable news sources and expert analysis to stay updated on market developments. Avoid impulsive decisions based on short-term fear or euphoria. These strategies can help investors prepare for the potential Bitcoin September weakness and make more resilient choices. Conclusion: Balancing Caution with Opportunity While the historical data pointing to Bitcoin September weakness certainly warrants caution, it’s essential to view the market through a balanced lens. The potential retest of the $100,000 support level, driven by ETF outflows, is a significant challenge. However, the possibility of a Fed interest rate cut offers a glimmer of hope for a market rebound. Ultimately, the cryptocurrency market is dynamic and influenced by a myriad of factors. By staying informed, understanding historical patterns, and implementing sound risk management strategies, investors can better position themselves to navigate the complexities of September and beyond. The coming weeks will undoubtedly be crucial for Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory, testing its resilience and the conviction of its holders. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is September always a bad month for Bitcoin? A1: While historical data shows an average decline of 6% in September over the past 12 years, it’s a seasonal trend, not a guarantee. Market conditions and macroeconomic factors can always influence the outcome. Q2: What are spot Bitcoin ETFs, and why are their outflows significant? A2: Spot Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Outflows indicate that more investors are selling their shares than buying, signaling reduced institutional demand and potential selling pressure on BTC. Q3: How could a Fed interest rate cut impact Bitcoin? A3: A cut in interest rates typically makes borrowing cheaper and can encourage investment in riskier assets like Bitcoin. It could inject liquidity into the market and potentially boost BTC’s price, mitigating some of the seasonal weakness. Q4: What is the significance of the $100,000 support level for Bitcoin? A4: The $100,000 level is both a strong psychological and technical support point for Bitcoin. Holding above this level can reassure investors, while a breach could trigger further selling and a move to lower price targets.

Just as blockchain and cryptocurrencies have democratized finance, Lovable AI is democratizing software creation, empowering individuals to build digital products without traditional coding barriers. This paradigm shift, highlighted by Lovable’s meteoric rise, signals a future where technological fluency is accessible to all, reshaping the landscape of venture capital and startup growth in the digital economy. Lovable AI : Pioneering Vibe-Coding for Everyone The atmosphere at Copenhagen’s Bella Center for this year’s TechBBQ conference was electric, with every seat filled as Anton Osika, co-founder of the innovative app Lovable, took the stage. Lovable stands out in the burgeoning AI sector known as vibe-coding . This revolutionary approach allows users to guide AI models intuitively to produce code, design websites, or even construct entire applications, eliminating the need for complex programming knowledge. This capability is a game-changer for entrepreneurs and creatives looking to bring their digital visions to life swiftly and efficiently. Lovable’s core mission is to simplify the process of building digital products. It specifically targets individuals with no prior coding experience, providing them with powerful tools that translate their ideas into functional software. The company’s agent, released in late June, is a testament to this vision. It helps users with critical development tasks, including: Reading and interpreting files. Debugging errors within generated code. Searching the web for relevant information and resources. Generating images for application interfaces. Locating and managing project files efficiently. These features underscore Lovable’s commitment to providing a comprehensive platform that empowers users to create sophisticated applications with unprecedented ease. As Osika noted, “In the past, you could create a really great first draft using Lovable. Now, you can build a full product and it’s much more like working with a real developer.” Unprecedented Growth and European Tech Unicorn Status Lovable’s journey from a Swedish startup to a formidable industry player has been nothing short of spectacular. In a mere eight months, the company achieved an Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) exceeding $100 million. This rapid financial growth was swiftly followed by a $200 million Series A funding round, which propelled its valuation to an astonishing $1.8 billion. This achievement officially crowned Lovable as Europe’s fastest-growing European tech unicorn , a testament to its innovative technology and strong market demand. The financial world has taken notice. Reports from The Financial Times indicate that investors are already keen to launch a Series B round, with offers valuing the company at an astounding $4 billion. Despite this immense interest, Lovable has shown no signs of rushing into further funding, preferring to focus on product development and user satisfaction. This strategic patience highlights a commitment to sustainable growth over rapid capital infusion, a characteristic often seen in mature, confident market leaders. The company’s impressive user base further validates its success: Over 2.3 million active users currently leverage Lovable’s platform. A substantial 180,000 of these users are paying subscribers. Osika explained that Lovable’s pricing model was deliberately set to cover operational costs, ensuring the company’s stability while providing accessible tools. Notable use cases include a marketer developing a sales training platform and an engineer managing multiple small businesses entirely on the Lovable platform, showcasing the versatility and practical utility of its offerings. Anton Osika’s Vision for AI App Development Speaking to Bitcoin World, Anton Osika articulated a bold vision for Lovable: to establish it as the premier platform for building software products. His aim is to guide founders through every stage of product development, enabling them to build AI-native companies more efficiently. This holistic approach extends beyond mere code generation to encompass a broader ecosystem of business tools. Osika elaborated on the future capabilities he envisions for Lovable, which include assisting with crucial business functions: Payment Integration: Streamlining the setup of payment gateways for businesses. User Understanding: Providing tools to analyze and comprehend user behavior. Company Incorporation: Potentially assisting with the legal and administrative processes of forming a company. This comprehensive strategy aims to position Lovable not just as a coding tool, but as an end-to-end solution for digital entrepreneurship. It addresses the common criticisms leveled against AI-generated code, which is sometimes perceived as brittle or better suited for demos than finished products. Osika counters this by emphasizing the universal need for code review, regardless of its origin. “All code should be reviewed before it is published,” he stated, “whether it is AI or human-generated.” This stance underscores a pragmatic approach to quality assurance in AI app development . Conquering Competition with No-Code AI Innovation Lovable currently operates on foundational models from other leading AI providers, including Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s GPT-5. This strategic reliance on external models introduces a unique dynamic, especially since both Anthropic and OpenAI offer their own product-development services, Claude Code and Codex, respectively. While these services are not identical to Lovable, the potential for these model providers to pivot and compete directly for Lovable’s user base is a clear industry tension. However, Osika remains unfazed. He told Bitcoin World that Lovable’s competitive edge lies in its singular focus on building the best product by leveraging a diverse array of AI model providers. This multi-model approach offers distinct advantages: Unmatched Capabilities: Tapping into numerous foundation models grants Lovable users access to a broader spectrum of AI functionalities. Flexibility and Agility: The company can grow rapidly without the burden of developing and maintaining duplicative infrastructure for its own foundational models. Provider Neutrality: Unlike model providers tied to their own ecosystems, Lovable can cherry-pick the best AI tools available, enhancing its platform’s overall strength. “That puts us in a better position than them,” Osika asserted, highlighting the strategic advantage of being an aggregator of AI capabilities. This approach ensures that “the scope of what you can achieve is constantly expanding.” To maintain its leadership in the no-code AI space, Lovable focuses on three critical pillars: speed, security, and an intuitive user experience. “If we continue to do that, we’re going to build more trust with our customers than anyone else,” Osika concluded, emphasizing simplicity as a core differentiator. Why Lovable Stays Rooted in the European Tech Unicorn Ecosystem Lovable’s deep ties to the Swedish tech market are integral to its identity. Osika, a Stockholm native, founded the company there, and its investor list, according to Pitchbook, includes prominent European firms and angel investors. These include Stefan Lindeberg (Nordic Game Ventures), Fredrik Hjelm (founder of Guestit), Greens Ventures (Nordic), Hummingbird Ventures (London), and 20VC (London), led by Harry Stebbings, who initiated Project Europe to channel more investments into the regional ecosystem. Noteworthy angel investors include Revolut CEO Nik Storonsky and Swedish founder Sebastian Siemiatkowski of Klarna, which is also a Lovable client, alongside HubSpot and Photoroom. The decision for Lovable to remain nestled in Europe, despite the common trend of European tech companies migrating to the United States for greater capital and opportunities, resonates deeply within the continent’s startup ecosystem. Shamillah Bankiya, a principal at the UK’s Dawn Capital, expressed the broader sentiment: “The success of Lovable and other European AI unicorns is a success for all of Europe.” She emphasized the cultural impact, stating, “It raises the bar for what ambitious founders across the continent can dream of and achieve.” While Lovable does maintain a team in Los Angeles, Osika currently sees no reason for a full migration, underscoring a commitment to nurturing European talent and innovation. In a powerful demonstration of this commitment, Osika has begun investing in other founders himself. Dennis Green-Lieber’s Danish consumer intelligence company, Propane.ai, recently received an investment from Osika as part of its $1.2 million seed round. Green-Lieber highlighted the inspirational effect of Lovable’s success: “Yes, we’ve had giants like Zendesk, Unity, Klarna, and Spotify over the past decade, but what Lovable shows is that with small teams, a global mindset, and relentless effort, you can still build a category-defining company.” He added, “As a founder, I can say it’s lit a fire in our ecosystem to see this happen right here at home.” This commitment solidifies Lovable’s role as a beacon for the European tech unicorn scene. A Future Forged in Innovation and Trust Lovable AI is more than just a rapidly growing startup; it represents a fundamental shift in how software is created and how businesses are built. By championing vibe-coding and offering robust no-code AI solutions, it empowers a new generation of entrepreneurs to innovate without the traditional technical hurdles. Anton Osika’s vision for an end-to-end product development platform, combined with Lovable’s strategic independence from single foundational models, positions it uniquely in the competitive AI landscape. Its commitment to its European roots further inspires a continent, proving that world-class innovation can thrive globally while remaining locally anchored. As Lovable continues to expand its capabilities and user base, its journey will undoubtedly shape the future of AI app development and the broader digital economy, demonstrating the unstoppable power of accessible technology.

51010794,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81167,1756720818,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Price Predictions for XRP, SUI, and RTX in 2025 as One Could See Viral Growth this Week",https://timestabloid.com/price-predictions-for-xrp-sui-and-rtx-in-2025-as-one-could-see/,"Let’s cut to the chase: Ripple (XRP), Sui (SUI), and Remittix (RTX) are trading whispers on every crypto chat. XRP’s rally talk, SUI’s DeFi gains, and Remittix’s presale talks are all in motion. But only one coin has the potential to go viral this week. Let’s explore how each stacks up for 2025. XRP: The Institutional Fav or Just Familiar Hype? A rebound is in the air for XRP. Recently, a whale quietly scooped 20 million XRP (about $50M) during a dip. That kind of buying signal doesn’t slip under anyone’s radar. Meanwhile, U.S. firms like Bitwise and WisdomTree have pushed for a spot XRP ETF, and the SEC has begun its 240-day review. JPMorgan recently speculated that early inflows could add anywhere between $4B to $8B over time. This momentum has institutional vibes written all over it. Analysts from Standard Chartered are calling for XRP to close 2025 at around $5.50. Others, poker-faced optimists, push for the $7–$10 range if all lines up. If regulation, whales, and use cases converge, XRP could ride the institutional wave back above $5 this year. SUI: Growing TVL, GameFi, and Real Use Don’t sleep on SUI; it’s not just another layer-1. DeFi activity has exploded: SUI’s TVL topped $2.08B, and daily DEX volumes hit $304M in early 2025. But here’s the wild part: apps like RECRD, think decentralized TikTok, are actually driving adoption. Over 1 million users engage daily, accumulating more than 100 million on-chain transactions in the past quarter alone. With DeFi, social dApps, and no-code utilities, SUI is morphing into a growing ecosystem. Some forecasts peg SUI at $4–$7 by late 2025, with even bolder projections stretching higher if its network stays hot. RTX: Why Remittix Could Explode This Week Now, let’s set XRP and SUI aside and move on to the present. Remittix is turning heads right now, not in 2026 or 2027, but instantly. It’s labeled the top crypto presale to buy now, with a $23M+ raise and 637M+ tokens sold at under $0.1 each. Its use case is powerful: real-time crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries, covering over 40 cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. That’s actual PayFi in action, not hype. Infrastructure in place: The CertiK audit has been completed, and BitMart , LBank , and other listings are about to go live. The beta wallet is scheduled to launch in mid-September. The word on trader streets is that a significant upside is expected; talk of 8,000% gains by March is circulating, driven by real traction rather than hype cycles. Put simply, Remittix blends volatility and value. It’s a meme-tank with a payment foundation , and that’s a rare breed. So, Who’s Gearing Up for Real Gains? XRP is a feel-good pick if you’re betting on ETF and institutional money. SUI is quietly building infrastructure and purpose-led use. However, if you’re watching this week for something that might explode, keep your eyes on Remittix. It’s early, under-the-radar, and building momentum, combining real utility, presale traction, and actual execution. Among the three, RTX feels built for that viral moment.

51010797,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81105,1756720821,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,New Crypto Coin Alert: A $0.035 DeFi Project Early Investors Call a Sleeper With an Easy $4 Target From Current Levels,https://timestabloid.com/new-crypto-coin-alert-a-0-035-defi-project-early-investors/,"Talk is cheap in crypto, and phrases like “easy $4 target” usually deserve skepticism. For a token priced at $0.035, hitting $4 would require more than hype—it will need product adoption, live betas that attract users, and expected Tier-1 listings that bring liquidity. Yet this is exactly why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing so much attention. Early investors are betting that the foundation being laid during its presale will enable a growth path that justifies the claim. Unlike meme tokens or overhyped gaming plays, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a protocol where lending, borrowing, and staking will intersect with clear mechanics. This creates not only room for speculation but also fundamental use cases that support expansion. For those exploring investing in crypto during presale seasons, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers the kind of asymmetric setup rarely seen outside of early Ethereum (ETH) or Solana (SOL). Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Different Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate as a decentralized lending platform designed around two complementary models. The first is Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending, where users supply stablecoins or leading digital assets directly into protocol contracts. These funds are pooled and automatically allocated to borrowers, with every loan secured through overcollateralized backing. The second model is Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, which allows direct matching between lenders and borrowers for more volatile assets. This approach unlocks higher return opportunities while maintaining system stability through carefully enforced collateral ratios. Collateral and liquidation mechanisms form the backbone of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s risk management framework. Every loan on the platform will require overcollateralization, strengthened by a Stability Factor to safeguard the protocol. If the value of collateral falls below the required threshold, liquidation is triggered. In such cases, liquidators are incentivized with discounts, ensuring a smooth and efficient process that protects lenders and stabilizes the system. To illustrate, a P2C lender who deposits $50,000 BUSD will receive mtBUSD on a 1:1 basis. At an annual percentage yield (APY) of 10%, this lender would earn approximately $5,000 in interest over the course of a year. On the borrower side, if a user supplies $1,500 worth of AVAX as collateral, with a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 55%, they would be eligible to borrow up to $825. Presale Midpoint — Phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is midway through its presale journey. The total supply is capped at 4 billion tokens. Phase 6 has already generated around $15.2 million, the current price sits at $0.035, holders now number over 15,900, and 30% of the 170 million tokens in this phase are already sold. With Phase 6 already 30% sold, the next phase will push the price +15% higher to $0.040. The leap from $0.035 to $4 is a 114x move, but a credible path exists. Conservatively, a beta demo is expected when the token goes live, and is projected to increase active users by 30%, raising transaction flow into staking pools. A planned Tier-1 CEX listing is expected to multiply daily volume by at least 5x, improving liquidity. Combined, these factors create both a conservative scenario where $1 arrives over multiple quarters and a bullish scenario where momentum accelerates directly toward the $4 conversation that early investors have been highlighting. Unlike vague crypto predictions, this pathway rests on specific catalysts backed by product activity. Roadmap, Security, and Incentives The roadmap spans four phases, beginning with presale infrastructure and extending through beta, staking expansion, and exchange listings. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already engaged CertiK, with a Token Scan Score of 95.00 and a Skynet Score of 78.00. The audit began on February 25, 2025, with revision scheduled for May 20, 2025. The project’s reach is already visible, with over 12,000 followers engaged online. Incentives further boost awareness: a $100K giveaway will reward 10 winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM each, while a 50,000 USDT bug bounty has been allocated to ensure technical resilience. Together, these build not only credibility but also an ecosystem that attracts liquidity providers and developers alike. The Investor Story Imagine an investor who rebalanced from BTC, ETH, or SOL into Phase 1 allocations at $0.035. Market chatter suggests returns already running 250% higher compared to early positioning. At listing, a projected price of $0.06 will mean a 70% gain from current levels on paper. At $4, that same entry multiplies by 114x. The justifications align with each step: the beta release drives adoption through real product usage, an expected Tier-1 exchange listing unlocks broader market volume, staking captures value from participants, and buybacks steadily increase demand. This chain of events underlines why early participants argue that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not simply another presale but a structured bet on functional DeFi adoption. For investors asking is crypto a good investment, the answer lies in identifying which projects align structural incentives with demand catalysts. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing that alignment now, at a fraction of the valuation of established names.

Key Takeaways: Private jet and luxury cruise companies are now accepting crypto as Bitcoin wealth fuels demand. Young crypto entrepreneurs are driving bookings, valuing speed, flexibility, and exclusive experiences. High-end travel brands are adapting quickly, with hotels, yachts, and airlines offering crypto payment options. The shift reflects the growing influence of young crypto entrepreneurs eager to spend their digital fortunes on convenience, speed, and exclusivity, according to a recent report by the Financial Times . FXAIR, a private jet company under the Flexjet umbrella, has started accepting crypto from clients following what its chair Kenn Ricci described as “tremendous” demand. Young Bitcoin Millionaires Fuel Surge in High-End Travel Demand Many of these customers are young, newly rich from the latest Bitcoin rally, and interested in traveling farther and faster. FXAIR charges around $80,000 for a one-way flight from London’s Farnborough airport to New York City. Ricci noted a noticeable uptick in bookings from “young entrepreneurs in the Bitcoin space,” adding that what they value most is time. “And time is the most precious luxury,” he said. Bitcoin recently hit a new high of $124,000, lifted by renewed political support in the U.S., including former President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance and regulatory appointments. The policy shift has also fueled gains in related stocks such as Coinbase and Circle, creating a fresh pool of affluent spenders. Luxury travel players are quickly adapting. Virgin Voyages now sells its $120,000 annual pass in crypto. NEW: LUXURY CRUISE COMPANY VIRGIN VOYAGES IS NOW ACCEPTING #BITCOIN HIGH NET WORTH DEMANDING BTC. LOVE TO SEE IT pic.twitter.com/OAO8GJtr2r — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) August 31, 2025 SeaDream Yacht Club, known for its ultra-personalized experience and near 1:1 crew-to-guest ratio, began accepting Bitcoin payments shortly after Trump’s return to office. “For these travelers, luxury isn’t about gold-trimmed service — it’s about flexibility,” said a source close to the yacht operator. “If they want to pay in crypto, we let them.” The trend extends beyond sea and air. Boutique hotel chains like The Kessler Collection and The Pavilions Hotels and Resorts are accepting cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Luxury Travel Spend Set to Nearly Double, with Many Coming From Crypto According to McKinsey, travelers aged 30 to 40 spent $28 billion on luxury travel in 2023, with that figure projected to nearly double to $54 billion by 2028. Many of these consumers are coming from the digital asset space. Nick Fazioli of Jefferies pointed out that this new class of traveler isn’t interested in old-school luxury. “They don’t want to sip champagne and eat caviar,” he said. “They want to be in three cities in one day and still make it home at night.” This trend extends to high-end watch collecting as well. Sean Parsons, CEO and co-founder of luxury watch marketplace Kettle, told Cryptonews earlier this year that there has been a modest uptick in Bitcoin payments across the platform. Parsons added that many of Kettle’s crypto-based transactions also come from ecosystems like Solana or Ethereum. “From our users’ perspective, BTC is still primarily treated as a store of value, which makes people less inclined to spend it on high-end goods,” Parsons said. “In contrast, more active traders on chains like SOL and ETH are comfortable spending their gains on luxury items.” The post Private Jet and Luxury Cruise Firms Embrace Crypto as Bitcoin Wealth Fuels Demand appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|Adoption|Bitcoin|Payment,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ETH|SOL|DOGE,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-09-01 10:01:00

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Bitcoin is finally showing strong signs of a potential rebound and a climb toward new highs. The OG crypto is up over 1.35% today, currently trading just shy of the $110K mark at the time of writing. The biggest reason to believe in a rebound? $BTC’s weekly candle is perfectly placed on both the 20 EMA and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level – with its wick touching these supports and the body bulking up above them as we speak. Together, these signals suggest Bitcoin may be ending its consolidation phase and now has all the fuel needed to rocket higher. Adding to the optimism, prominent crypto voices like Michael Saylor and Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao tweeted in support of Bitcoin over the weekend, reinforcing bullish sentiment just as the charts start to turn in its favor. Hong Kong’s Business School Plans to Accept BTC for Tuitions and Donations September 1, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Hong Kong’s Business School (HKU) is considering accepting Bitcoin payments for tuition and donations. HKU’s dean and Chair of Economics said: All the technical details have been sorted out. We will take Bitcoin and digital currencies for tuition fees and donations in the future. —Professor Hongbin Cai, HKU Dean and Chair of Economics This move underlines Hong Kong’s mission to become a global crypto hub. Last month, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority released a stablecoin licensing framework . The legislation adds compliance rules, risk management, anti-money laundering safeguards, and much more to legislate crypto. Hong Kong seems to be following the same path of the US and El Salvador, the Bitcoin path. This can only help the coin achieve higher highs, encourage global adoption, and bring legitimacy to the industry. As big players like Metaplanet are buying more Bitcoin , retail investors are also looking for the next crypto to explode . Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is one of the most promising presales today, a utility-based altcoin that plans a Bitcoin Layer-2 to bring dApps and smart contracts to Bitcoin’s chain.

Crypto Investor: ‘Bitcoin will be around for a long, long time’; Bitcoin Hyper Presale Surges September 1, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Crypto investor Jordi Visser predicts that Bitcoin will take over the stock market once AI development renders the latter obsolete. The statement came in an interview with Anthony Pompiliano , where Visser stated that Bitcoin will be around for a long time and that people fighting this idea won’t change anything. In Visser’s view, the introduction of AI tech will eventually render the stock market inconsequential, which will shift the financial market towards digital assets, aka Bitcoin. A Bitcoin-favorable financial context would fire up Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) thanks to its on-chain utility.

Digital Wallets Account for 16% of Online Payments – This Wallet Currency Could Be the Next Crypto to Explode September 1, 2025 • 10:00 UTC The US is warming up to digital wallets, a new market study by PYMNTS shows. And it’s not Gen Z leading the charge. Here’s what the PYMNTS report revealed: For online payments, credit cards and digital wallets are the most popular. 16% of survey respondents said they used digital wallets for recent purchases. Digital wallets have seen the highest adoption rate among Millennials and Gen Xers. Security and ease were the most commonly cited reasons for using credit cards online. Older consumers are also warming up to digital wallets, the data suggests. We also know that crypto adoption is on the rise, having nearly tripled since 2021. Today, approximately 28% of American adults own digital assets . As the growing adoption of digital wallets, crypto, and self-custody solutions converge, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) could be the next crypto to explode in the upcoming years. Its digital crypto wallet bridges the gap between retail and crypto in several ways — easy onramping, stablecoin support across multiple chains, and an upcoming debit card with a cashback program.

September 1, 2025 • 10:00 UTC A new mystery token broke the meme coin market. Put out via Pump.fun’s launchpad, the unnamed, ticketless coin reportedly reached $1.8M in trading volume within its first 24 hours. Pump.fun later took to X , posting a cryptic message that further fueled hype and speculation. However, there have been no new developments since. But it wouldn’t be the first time when crypto traders have pumped the most bizarre projects. Look no further than $FARTCOIN – a token that serves no purpose, yet somehow maintains a $737M+ market cap and $110M+ daily trading volume . Some coins aren’t even trading, but are already making waves among degens. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , for example, is nearing $2M+ raised during presale just weeks after the ICO launched. Unlike the hundreds of new coins popping up recently, though, this one benefits from viral meme branding. A gym-bro Giga Doge obsessed with leverage maxxing and chasing the pump?

The US Dollar , often a bellwether for global economic sentiment, has found itself in an unusual state of quietude. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traditional investors alike, understanding this pause is crucial. The market is buzzing with anticipation, not of immediate action, but of future decisions from the Federal Reserve. This period of muted activity signals a deeper struggle between current economic data and the looming prospect of significant shifts in monetary policy, specifically potential interest rate cuts. How these traditional market forces play out directly influences the liquidity and risk appetite that can flow into or out of the volatile crypto markets. Why is the US Dollar Muted? Decoding Market Expectations The US Dollar ‘s recent behavior has been a study in market paradox. Despite some robust economic indicators, the greenback has largely traded sideways, showing little conviction. This ‘muted’ state isn’t a sign of indifference but rather a reflection of a market caught between conflicting signals and deeply entrenched expectations. Traders are currently engaged in a delicate balancing act, weighing present economic strength against the strong probability of future policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve. Several factors contribute to this subdued performance: Anticipation of Easing: A significant portion of the market has already ‘priced in’ the expectation of future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. This means that even positive economic news, which might typically strengthen the dollar, has a diminished impact because the market is looking beyond current data to the anticipated dovish shift. Relative Central Bank Stance: While the Federal Reserve is contemplating cuts, other major central banks globally are also facing similar dilemmas or are perceived to be even more dovish. This creates a relative equilibrium, preventing the dollar from gaining significant ground against its peers. Economic Resilience vs. Inflation: The US economy has shown surprising resilience, particularly in the labor market. However, inflation, while moderating, remains a key concern. This creates a complex scenario where strong growth could argue against immediate cuts, yet the inflation trajectory suggests easing might be necessary. The Federal Reserve ‘s Dilemma: Balancing Inflation and Growth At the heart of the US Dollar ‘s current predicament is the formidable challenge facing the Federal Reserve . Their dual mandate – achieving maximum employment and maintaining price stability (i.e., controlling inflation) – is currently being tested by a dynamic economic landscape. On one hand, the labor market has remained remarkably robust, defying predictions of a significant slowdown. On the other hand, while inflation has cooled from its peaks, it has yet to consistently reach the Fed’s target of 2%. This creates a delicate balancing act for policymakers. The Fed must navigate a path that avoids two pitfalls: Cutting rates too early: This could reignite inflationary pressures, undoing the progress made through aggressive rate hikes. Cutting rates too late: This risks stifling economic growth unnecessarily, potentially pushing the economy into a recession. Statements from Fed officials, the ‘dot plot’ projections, and the minutes from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings are meticulously scrutinized for clues about their evolving stance. Any hint of a shift in their outlook can send ripples across global financial markets, directly influencing the US Dollar’s trajectory. Anticipating Interest Rate Cuts : What’s the Market Saying? The discussion around interest rate cuts has dominated financial headlines, shaping investor sentiment and driving trading strategies. The market largely anticipates that the Federal Reserve will begin to ease its monetary policy at some point in the near future. This expectation is fueled by several factors, including a gradual cooling of inflation, signs of moderation in consumer spending, and a desire to avoid an overly restrictive policy that could trigger an economic downturn. However, the timing and magnitude of these cuts remain highly uncertain. Here’s what’s influencing the debate: Inflation Data: Key inflation metrics like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index are paramount. A sustained decline towards the 2% target would bolster the case for cuts. Labor Market Strength: A surprisingly resilient job market, with low unemployment and steady wage growth, could give the Fed reason to delay cuts, fearing a resurgence of inflation. Global Economic Health: Weakness in other major economies could pressure the Fed to cut rates to support global growth and prevent a stronger dollar from hurting US exports. Financial Stability Concerns: Any emerging risks to financial stability could also prompt the Fed to consider easing policy. The market’s ‘pricing in’ of cuts means that current asset valuations, including those in the cryptocurrency space, already reflect a certain level of optimism about future lower borrowing costs. Any deviation from these expectations – whether cuts come sooner, later, or are less aggressive than anticipated – could lead to significant market volatility. Beyond Rate Hikes: Understanding the Broader Monetary Policy Landscape While interest rate cuts grab headlines, it’s essential to understand that the Federal Reserve’s toolkit for monetary policy extends far beyond just adjusting the federal funds rate. The broader landscape of monetary policy involves several interconnected mechanisms that collectively influence economic conditions, liquidity, and asset prices. For investors, particularly those in the cryptocurrency space, grasping these nuances provides a more complete picture of the forces at play. Key components of the Fed’s broader monetary policy include: Quantitative Tightening (QT): This involves the Fed reducing the size of its balance sheet by allowing maturing bonds to roll off without reinvestment. QT effectively drains liquidity from the financial system, acting as a tightening measure. The pace and duration of QT are just as important as rate decisions. Forward Guidance: This refers to the Fed’s communication about the future path of monetary policy. By providing guidance, the Fed aims to influence market expectations and guide long-term interest rates, even without immediate action. Clear, consistent guidance can reduce uncertainty. Reserve Requirements: Though less frequently adjusted, the Fed can influence the amount of funds banks must hold in reserve, impacting their lending capacity. Open Market Operations: The buying and selling of government securities to inject or withdraw money from the banking system, directly influencing the supply of money and credit. A shift towards easing could involve not only rate cuts but also a slowing or eventual end to quantitative tightening, which would inject more liquidity into the system. This increased liquidity often finds its way into various asset classes, including riskier ones like cryptocurrencies, as investors seek higher returns in a lower-yield environment. Understanding these interconnected policy levers is crucial for anticipating market movements. Navigating the Forex Market : Strategies for Volatile Times The Forex Market , the world’s largest and most liquid financial market, is where the implications of the Federal Reserve’s decisions are most immediately felt. The US Dollar’s performance against other major currencies like the Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), and British Pound (GBP) is a direct reflection of relative economic outlooks and central bank policies. In times of uncertainty surrounding potential interest rate cuts, the forex market can become particularly volatile, presenting both challenges and opportunities for traders and investors. How does Fed policy influence the forex market? Scenario Impact on US Dollar Broader Forex Impact Fed Cuts Rates Aggressively Weakens USD (lower yield attractiveness) Boosts risk-on currencies (e.g., AUD, NZD); potentially strengthens other major currencies if their central banks hold rates. Fed Delays Rate Cuts / Hints at Hikes Strengthens USD (higher yield attractiveness, safe-haven appeal) Weakens risk-on currencies; puts pressure on other central banks to maintain higher rates to prevent currency depreciation. Fed Holds Rates, Global Central Banks Cut Strengthens USD (relative yield advantage) Weakens other major currencies against USD, potentially increasing capital flows into US assets. For traders, understanding these dynamics is key. Strategies often involve monitoring economic data releases from various regions, analyzing central bank rhetoric, and observing geopolitical events. The US Dollar’s role as a global reserve currency and a safe-haven asset means that during periods of global uncertainty, it can still appreciate even if domestic policy points towards easing. This complex interplay requires careful analysis and adaptive strategies. The Domino Effect: How Fed Policy Impacts Cryptocurrencies While the focus keywords revolve around traditional finance, the implications for the cryptocurrency market are profound and often immediate. The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, particularly decisions regarding interest rates and liquidity, directly influences the broader financial environment in which digital assets operate. Understanding this connection is vital for crypto investors. Lower Interest Rates & Liquidity: When the Fed signals or implements interest rate cuts, it generally leads to a ‘risk-on’ environment. Lower borrowing costs mean more capital is available, and traditional fixed-income investments offer less attractive returns. This often pushes investors to seek higher yields and growth opportunities in riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Increased liquidity in the system can also flow into digital assets. Dollar Strength vs. Risk Appetite: A weaker US Dollar, often a consequence of easing monetary policy, tends to correlate with increased appetite for risk assets. Conversely, a strong dollar can draw capital away from speculative assets and into dollar-denominated safe havens, putting downward pressure on crypto prices. Inflation Hedges: For some investors, cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are viewed as a potential hedge against inflation. If the Fed’s easing policy is perceived to lead to higher inflation, it could bolster the narrative for crypto as a store of value. Institutional Flows: Major institutional investors often allocate capital based on macro-economic conditions. A favorable monetary policy environment can encourage greater institutional adoption and investment in the crypto space, driving market growth. Therefore, tracking the Federal Reserve’s communications and economic data releases is not just for forex traders; it’s a critical component of a well-informed cryptocurrency investment strategy. The future trajectory of digital assets is inextricably linked to the decisions made in the hallowed halls of central banks. Challenges and Opportunities in a Shifting Landscape The current environment, marked by the US Dollar ‘s muted stance and the impending decisions of the Federal Reserve , presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities across all financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. Challenges: Volatility: Uncertainty surrounding the timing and extent of interest rate cuts can lead to heightened volatility in the Forex Market and beyond. This makes precise trading and long-term planning difficult. Policy Misinterpretation: The market’s interpretation of Fed communications can sometimes differ from the actual policy intent, leading to sharp, unexpected reactions. Economic Headwinds: Underlying economic issues, both domestic and global, could complicate the Fed’s decision-making, potentially leading to less favorable outcomes for risk assets. Liquidity Shifts: Changes in monetary policy can rapidly alter market liquidity, affecting asset prices and trading conditions. Opportunities: Strategic Positioning: For astute investors, anticipating shifts in Fed policy can offer opportunities to strategically position portfolios, moving into or out of assets that stand to benefit or suffer from policy changes. Diversification: The interconnectedness of markets highlights the importance of diversification, balancing traditional assets with digital assets to mitigate risk. Arbitrage and Trading: Increased volatility in the forex market can create short-term trading opportunities for experienced participants. Long-Term Crypto Growth: A sustained period of lower interest rates and increased liquidity, if it materializes, could provide a tailwind for the long-term growth and institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Navigating this landscape requires not just vigilance but also a deep understanding of how macro-economic forces translate into market movements. It’s a time for informed decision-making over reactive panic. Actionable Insights: What to Watch Next As the financial world awaits clearer signals from the Federal Reserve, here are key actionable insights and data points to monitor: Inflation Reports: Keep a close eye on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data. A consistent trend towards the Fed’s 2% target will be a strong indicator for future interest rate cuts . Employment Data: Non-farm payrolls, unemployment rates, and wage growth figures provide insights into the health of the labor market, which is a critical factor in the Fed’s dual mandate. Fed Speeches & Minutes: Pay attention to public statements from Federal Reserve officials and the detailed minutes of FOMC meetings. These often contain subtle but important shifts in language and outlook. Economic Growth Indicators: GDP reports, retail sales, and manufacturing data offer a broader picture of economic momentum and can influence the urgency of monetary policy adjustments. Global Economic Health: Developments in major economies like the Eurozone and China can indirectly influence the Federal Reserve ‘s decisions and the relative strength of the US Dollar in the Forex Market . For cryptocurrency investors, these macro indicators are just as important as on-chain data. They provide the overarching context for market sentiment and capital flows. Adapting investment strategies based on these evolving macroeconomic signals will be crucial for success in the coming months. Conclusion: Awaiting the Next Chapter in Monetary Policy The current quietude of the US Dollar is deceptive, masking a period of intense anticipation and strategic positioning within global financial markets. The financial community, from seasoned forex traders to cryptocurrency enthusiasts, is keenly watching the Federal Reserve , whose upcoming decisions on interest rate cuts will chart the course for monetary policy and ripple across the entire Forex Market and beyond. This pivotal moment underscores the delicate balance the Fed must maintain between controlling inflation and fostering economic growth. As we move forward, vigilance and a nuanced understanding of macroeconomic indicators will be paramount for navigating the inherent challenges and seizing the emerging opportunities in this evolving landscape. The next chapter in monetary policy is not just about numbers; it’s about the fundamental shifts that will redefine market dynamics for the foreseeable future.

This isn’t just a number; it’s a clear indicator of a thriving ecosystem and significant user adoption. Unpacking Tron’s Unprecedented Rise in Active Addresses Recent data from Lookonchain has spotlighted Tron’s exceptional performance, revealing its dominance in user engagement. With 2.48 million active addresses, Tron has surpassed even major players like BNB Smart Chain (BSC), which recorded 2.28 million. This significant lead highlights Tron’s growing influence and its ability to attract and retain a substantial user base. But what exactly does this metric signify, and why is it so crucial for a blockchain’s health? Essentially, an active address represents a unique wallet that has initiated at least one transaction within a specific timeframe, offering a snapshot of real-world usage and demand. The continuous growth in Tron active addresses suggests a robust and dynamic network that is actively being utilized by millions. What Drives High Tron Network Activity? Several factors contribute to Tron’s impressive network activity. One primary driver is its reputation for offering extremely low transaction fees, making it an attractive option for everyday crypto transactions and micro-payments. This cost-effectiveness significantly lowers the barrier to entry for new users and encourages frequent engagement. Furthermore, Tron boasts high transaction speeds, ensuring quick and efficient processing, which is vital for a seamless user experience. The network has also become a preferred hub for stablecoin transfers, particularly USDT (Tether), due to these favorable conditions. This widespread use for stablecoin transactions significantly boosts the number of Tron active addresses . Key Factors Contributing to Tron’s Growth: Low Transaction Fees: Makes the network accessible and affordable for a broad user base. High Transaction Speeds: Ensures quick and efficient processing of transactions. Robust Stablecoin Ecosystem: A popular choice for stablecoin transfers, especially USDT. Developer-Friendly Environment: Attracts decentralized applications (DApps) and innovative projects. The expanding ecosystem of decentralized applications (DApps) built on Tron, ranging from DeFi platforms to gaming, also plays a crucial role in boosting user numbers. These applications provide diverse utilities, drawing in users seeking various blockchain-based services. The Significance of Leading Tron Active Addresses Why should we pay attention to the number of active addresses? This metric is often considered a key indicator of a blockchain’s fundamental health and utility. A high number of Tron active addresses signifies genuine user adoption and engagement, rather than just speculative trading. It suggests that people are actively using the network for its intended purposes, whether it’s sending money, interacting with DApps, or participating in governance. Moreover, strong network activity often correlates with increased demand for the native token, TRX, as it’s used for transaction fees and staking. This organic demand can contribute to the long-term stability and value appreciation of the asset. The fact that Tron is leading in this crucial metric underscores its position as a highly utilized and relevant blockchain in the competitive crypto landscape. This consistent user engagement is a testament to the network’s resilience and its ability to deliver value to its community. Challenges and the Road Ahead for Tron While the current lead in Tron active addresses is a significant achievement, the blockchain space is constantly evolving. Tron, like any other network, faces challenges such as maintaining scalability as user numbers grow, ensuring robust security against potential threats, and navigating regulatory landscapes that are still taking shape globally. However, Tron’s proactive approach to innovation and community engagement suggests a promising future. The network’s continuous efforts to expand its DApp ecosystem, improve infrastructure, and foster partnerships are vital for sustaining its growth trajectory. The commitment to providing an efficient and cost-effective blockchain experience will be key to retaining its leadership position and attracting even more users in the long run. The journey of blockchain adoption is dynamic, and Tron’s current performance sets a strong precedent for its continued impact. In conclusion, Tron’s impressive lead with 2.48 million active addresses is a powerful statement about its current standing in the blockchain world. This metric is a strong indicator of real-world utility and a thriving ecosystem, driven by low fees, high speeds, and a growing DApp presence. As the network continues to innovate and adapt, its strong foundation of active users positions it as a formidable force, shaping the future of decentralized technology.

Which of these horses are you backing? Gold breaks out of ascending triangle Source: TradingView As can be seen on the daily chart for gold, the breakout occurred on Friday and the price is now heading for the $3,500 all-time high on Monday. The series of higher lows of the price action leading into the breakout helped to form an ascending triangle with the $3,430 horizontal resistance level. Breaking out of such a bullish formation should help upside price momentum. Source: TradingView The weekly chart for gold shows the long run-up in the price since the beginning of 2024. The breakout of this ascending channel, plus the formation of the ascending triangle, has led to this bullish setup. The measured move out of the triangle could take the price to $3,750. Silver continues huge move higher Source: TradingView The silver 2-week chart illustrates the massive move out of the triangle. The next target is the 0.786 Fibonacci at $41.64, although expect this one to go a lot further. Silver forming a 45-year cup and handle pattern Source: TradingView Zooming even further out on the 2-week chart for silver it can be seen that the price is actually forming an absolutely massive 45-year cup and handle pattern. Given the tremendous amount of subjugation of the price over these 45 years, there is a good likelihood that this could play out. Just below $100 would be the target. Bitcoin latest rejection from breakout of channel Source: TradingView Meanwhile, the $BTC price has suffered its next rejection of the upper side of the ascending channel. Is this to be yet another refusal from the bears that continues to take $BTC down and into its next bear market? Probably not. The price could have just come back to retest the horizontal support before a successful breakout on the next attempt. Which will be the fastest horse? So with Bitcoin lagging as gold and silver plough higher, which of these is likely to be the fastest horse, at least for the next few weeks and perhaps months? My money is still on Bitcoin.

The move comes amid a 40-day downtrend that cost the trader roughly $450,000. Tokens are often transferred to accounts on exchanges in preparation for an impending sale. The token most recently traded at $0.00000992, according to market data, bouncing from earlier lows near $0.00000938. Prices swung within a 6% range before recovering toward resistance at $0.00000983. The whale, according to blockchain data, is still holding onto 1.5 trillion PEPE tokens worth more than $14 million. More than 3.26 trillion PEPE tokens changed hands during the session, with the strongest volumes recorded during the recovery phase, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model. After dipping to the session’s low, PEPE rebounded sharply as buyers stepped in at support levels. That surge lifted the price close to an intraday peak. The market responded to the transfer with sustained buying interest, a sign of confidence or opportunistic accumulation. Still, bearish pressure hasn’t vanished. Resistance remains firm just below $0.00001, and price action continues to test support levels. Nansen data supports the case for opportunity accumulation, as it shows that PEPE whales on Ethereum added 1.46% to their holdings over the past 30 days.

Price eyes $110,100 resistance, with potential upside to $112,500 if momentum holds above support. Traders note calm market conditions, with many watching for a strong breakout in Q4. Golden Cross Returns, Is BTC Ready? Bitcoin has printed a Golden Cross on the weekly chart, where the 50-week moving average moves above the 200-week moving average. This technical signal last appeared in 2015, 2016, and 2019, and each time, it was followed by a sharp price rise. Previous moves after similar setups saw gains of 264%, 2,200%, and 1,190%, respectively. In 2025, the signal has returned. While the chart points to a possible move higher, there is no confirmed breakout yet. The asset is currently near $109,500, as the market waits for a stronger trend to form. Bitcoin at a golden cross Alt coins the most over sold they have EVER been The bounce will be glorious And it will be SOON Are your bags packed? pic.twitter.com/ViI8GlERcT — Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) August 31, 2025 Crypto analyst Gordon commented on the Golden Cross, saying Bitcoin is “at a golden cross,” while adding that “altcoins [are] the most oversold they have EVER been.” He also said, “The bounce will be glorious… and it will be SOON.” His remarks reflect a view that both Bitcoin and altcoins may be setting up for a stronger move. So far, the longer-term chart shows potential, but there is no confirmed direction until key price levels are reclaimed. Price Approaches Key Resistance Zones On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin bounced from the $107,130 area and moved toward short-term resistance at $110,100. Analyst Lennaert Snyder noted this level as important, saying, “Bitcoin grabbed liquidity and is pushing.” He added that a move above $110,100 could lead to a rally toward $112,500. However, he also stated that $110,100 could act as resistance if the move fails. A possible higher low around $108,300 was also noted, which would help maintain short-term bullish structure if the price revisits it. Traders Expect Low Volatility Until Clear Signal According to Daan Crypto Trades, the market has been quiet since July. He said, “It’s been a while since the market was truly overheated,” adding that outside of one move above $120K in July, price action has remained steady. His view is that the market is waiting for the next major shift. Tom Tucker pointed out that August followed its usual trend, with Bitcoin dropping around 6.5%. He said, “September has been tricky, but if it holds $100K support, it could trigger a strong Q4 rebound.” August kept $BTC seasonal trend intact, slipping ~6.5%. Still, this year’s drop fared better than the past four Augusts. History rhymes, but this time it stings a little less. September has been tricky, but if it holds $100K support, it could trigger a strong Q4 rebound. pic.twitter.com/u2TPsM40ZX — Tom Tucker (@WhatzTheTicker) August 31, 2025 Notably, traders now watch key resistance zones for confirmation. A move above $110,100 and sustained momentum could signal a shift. Until then, Bitcoin remains range-bound with both upside and downside scenarios in play.

This Solana price target reflects genuine network improvements and growing ecosystem adoption. However, even this optimistic forecast pales next to the potential of emerging meme coins. Layer Brett is capturing attention with 120x potential that SOL cannot mathematically achieve. The comparison highlights how different assets serve different investment purposes. Solana offers relative stability and established technology. Layer Brett provides explosive growth potential through its unique combination of factors. Solana’s strength and limitations The Solana price forecast of $250 represents solid growth from current levels. This gain would require continued ecosystem expansion and maintained network reliability. SOL’s technological improvements have addressed previous congestion issues, supporting positive price movement. However, Solana’s substantial market cap creates natural growth limitations. Achieving significant percentage moves requires massive capital inflow that becomes increasingly difficult. This mathematical reality drives diversification toward newer assets. Layer Brett’s growth mathematics Layer Brett’s 120x potential stems from its micro-cap status and strong fundamentals. It requires relatively minimal capital to achieve exponential growth compared to large-cap projects like Solana. This mathematical advantage cannot be overstated for return-seeking investors. The project’s Ethereum Layer 2 foundation provides technological credibility while maintaining meme coin excitement. This combination appeals to both practical users and speculative investors, creating broad-based demand. Technology comparison Solana offers impressive transaction speeds and low costs when the network operates properly. Layer Brett provides similar benefits through its Layer 2 architecture while maintaining Ethereum’s security guarantees. This approach offers reliability during high-demand periods. The technological differences reflect different design philosophies. Solana prioritizes performance as a standalone chain.

The coin has been trading near $4,645 after recovering from early-week losses and has posted a 235% rally from the year’s low. Analysts are pointing to whale purchases, surging ETF inflows, and futures open interest as the main drivers. Consequently, Ethereum is now being positioned for a potential jump to $5,500 in the short term. At the same time, a new crypto presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , has been gaining traction among investors and is already shaping up as one of the best cryptos to buy now. Ethereum Price Building Momentum Ethereum price has been ranging behind a strong rally. Tom Lee, a long-standing market strategist, has argued that the pause is only temporary and that ETH has more upside. ETF inflows are adding fuel to the rally, with over $1.3 billion in assets accumulated in the last four days. This fact will boost the aggregate inflow to the initial level of 13 billion, hence confidence in the underlying demand base of Ethereum. The newest market trend has brought institutional market stakeholders, quasi-known as whales, into the new points of entry into the cryptocurrency marketplace, and the recent acquisition of Ethereum for 164 million seems to be one of the most high profile transactions so far worth highlighting a stronger sense of expectation of future returns. Furthermore, futures data has confirmed that open interest has grown to $63.7 billion this week, a bullish sign when paired with lower liquidations and a positive funding rate. Technically, ETH has broken through a triple-top formation of the previous year, a breakout which is now being followed by a bullish pennant. Therefore, many traders are expecting the next target to stretch toward $6,250, which would represent a further 37% upside from current levels. Mutuum Finance Presale Gaining Steam Mutuum finance is in the sixth phase of its presale where tokens are being sold at a unit value of $0.035. Since it started the presale at an initial price of $0.01, the token has risen in value by 250 percent, or a 3.5-fold value increase to those who started first. This has to this point resulted in proceeds to presale being accumulated up to as much as $15,220,000 and the list of those who have settled in as MUTM holders now adds up to 15,880. Importantly, Phase 6 is rapidly moving towards completing subscription which narrows the acquisition opportunity within the current price regime. When Phase 7 opens, it is expected to increase in unit price by 14.3 percentage points to achieve $0.04 with final start at $0.06. Moreover, mutuum Finance provides practical monetary value by implementing a twin-lending architecture and accumulating peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract options, therefore, providing low-risk and sophisticated investors with a versatile alternative option. A unique stablecoin system is being introduced, minted only during loans and burned on repayment, ensuring long-term value stability. Consequently, the project is being viewed not just as another altcoin but as a practical tool for decentralized lending and borrowing. Investor confidence has been bolstered by the fact that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has finalized its CertiK audit with a security score of 95.00. On top of this, Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 bug bounty program with CertiK. The team has also introduced a dashboard with a leaderboard for the top 50 holders. Those who maintain their positions are being rewarded with bonus tokens, further driving long-term holding behavior. Why Mutuum Finance Is Ready To Explode Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already gained 250% from its first presale phase, and demand is accelerating as it advances toward launch. While Ethereum is consolidating toward the $5,500 target, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering investors a chance to enter early at a price that will not be available much longer. Therefore, ETH is showing strength, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as the new crypto coin positioned for explosive growth in 2025 and beyond.

51013998,570780,1756726204,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51013998.jpeg,ETFs Ethereum battent Bitcoin : ETH levier de rendement ?,https://bitcoinist.com/etfs-ethereum-bitcoin-eth-levier-rendement/,"Août 2025. Le paysage des cryptomonnaies change . Sous nos yeux. Pendant des années, Bitcoin a gardé son statut de géant incontesté. Surtout auprès des institutionnels. Pourtant, ces dernières semaines, une bascule s’opère . Les flux de capitaux se dirigent massivement vers Ethereum , via les ETFs. Plus de 1,8 milliard de dollars injectés en quelques jours, pendant que les produits adossés à Bitcoin enregistrent des sorties. Un contraste brutal , qui dit beaucoup sur l’évolution du marché. La montée en puissance des ETFs Ethereum Les chiffres ne mentent pas : les encours sous gestion des ETFs Ethereum dépassent maintenant les 30 milliards de dollars . Pour un actif souvent perçu comme plus risqué que Bitcoin , c’est un tournant. Les gestionnaires de fonds, réputés prudents, choisissent aujourd’hui Ethereum comme véhicule privilégié. Pourquoi ? Parce que l’actif ne se contente pas d’exister, il produit. Le staking rapporte, la DeFi prospère, les mises à jour du protocole améliorent en permanence sa performance. Bitcoin reste un socle, une réserve numérique. Mais il est statique. Ethereum , lui, est vivant. Et c’est cette vitalité qui attire l’argent institutionnel. Ethereum : un rendement qui change la donne Ce qui fait la différence, c’est le rendement. Les ETFs Ethereum s’appuient sur un actif qui, grâce au staking, offre naturellement un retour annuel. Même indirect, cet avantage séduit. Les fonds savent qu’ils ne trouveront jamais cela avec Bitcoin . Dans un univers où chaque point de rendement compte, la décision est simple . Ce rendement n’est pas la seule explication. Ethereum avance , là où Bitcoin se contente de maintenir son cap . Les mises à jour récentes, comme Dencun ou Pectra , ont réduit les coûts sur les couches 2. Résultat : un réseau plus rapide, plus accessible, plus accueillant pour la finance décentralisée. C’est tout un écosystème qui en profite, et les investisseurs institutionnels parient dessus. Un rééquilibrage des portefeuilles Dans les grandes banques, dans les fonds de pension, les allocations bougent . Les portefeuilles autrefois saturés de Bitcoin laissent de plus en plus de place à Ethereum . On ne parle plus de 70 % BTC et 30 % ETH . On parle de répartition inversée, où Ethereum peut peser deux fois plus que Bitcoin . Ce changement n’est pas anodin. Il traduit une conviction. Ethereum n’est plus une alternative . C’est le cœur de l’économie blockchain. Les institutionnels y voient un actif d’avenir. Et ils l’intègrent dans leurs stratégies à long terme. L’impact d’Ethereum sur les investisseurs particuliers Cette dynamique, d’ailleurs, n’a pas seulement un effet institutionnel. Elle rejaillit sur tout l’écosystème . Quand les grandes masses de capitaux s’ancrent dans Ethereum , la confiance des particuliers grandit. Mais, pour ceux qui cherchent à dépasser les gains modestes des produits traditionnels, la clé se trouve ailleurs. Car si les ETFs apportent la stabilité, ils ne vous rendront jamais riche. L’histoire de la crypto le rappelle : les multiples ne se font pas dans les actifs institutionnalisés. Ils se font dans les marges, sur les projets encore jeunes, portés par une communauté en ébullition ou par une utilité claire. Et en ce moment, deux projets illustrent parfaitement cette logique . Maxi Doge, la démesure comme moteur Le premier s’appelle Maxi Doge . Impossible de passer à côté de son identité : un Shiba Inu bodybuildé, obsédé par le trading à levier. Tout est pensé pour la provocation et l’exagération. Mais derrière cette image se cache une mécanique simple : créer un meme coin viral, capable d’attirer une communauté massive. La prévente a déjà récolté près de 1,6 million de dollars . Le prix du token est fixé à 0,0002545 $ . Un niveau qui paraît insignifiant, mais c’est justement cette faible valorisation qui attire les parieurs. Dans l’univers des meme coins, le branding est roi, et Maxi Doge a compris la recette. La communauté s’agrandit, la visibilité augmente, et l’effet boule de neige peut se déclencher à tout moment. Vous voulez un multiple ? C’est dans ce type de projet qu’il se trouve. Mais encore faut-il se placer avant la fin de la prévente . Participez à la prévente de $MAXI ! Best Wallet, la construction patiente À l’opposé de ce chaos volontaire, Best Wallet propose une vision sérieuse, presque institutionnelle. Une application mobile multichaîne, un DEX intégré, du staking, et bientôt une carte crypto avec cashback jusqu’à 8 %. Rien de fantaisiste ici. L’ambition est claire : devenir un hub complet pour les utilisateurs crypto, un outil du quotidien. La présale a levé plus de 15,3 millions de dollars , elle fait donc logiquement partie des meilleurs préventes . Le prix actuel, 0,025545 $ , reste attractif par rapport aux perspectives. Best Wallet n’est pas un pari court-termiste. C’est un projet conçu pour durer. Pour évoluer avec l’écosystème, et pour répondre à un besoin concret. Celui de gérer simplement ses actifs sur plusieurs blockchains. Dans ce marché ou Ethereum capte les institutions, un projet comme Best Wallet se positionne comme un relais naturel. Il n’a pas besoin d’être viral pour réussir. Son utilité lui donne une légitimité durable, et rend sa presale très, très attractive. Participez à la prévente de $BEST ! La logique des flux Ethereum Les ETFs Ethereum prouvent que le marché institutionnel a trouvé son nouveau champion. Mais ce mouvement massif n’empêche pas la recherche de rendement plus audacieux. Au contraire, il le stimule . Car quand les grands acteurs sécurisent leurs positions, les plus petits cherchent à s’exposer à des paris asymétriques. Maxi Doge et Best Wallet illustrent clairement cette complémentarité et affichent des prévisions de prix alléchantes. L’un incarne la spéculation brute. L’autre la conviction utilitaire. Tous deux bénéficient du climat actuel. Dans lequel la confiance dans Ethereum se traduit par un appétit renouvelé pour les projets périphériques. Deux temporalités, une même opportunité Le message est limpide. Les institutionnels choisissent Ethereum parce qu’il rapporte et qu’il évolue. Mais les particuliers peuvent aller plus loin. Les multiples se trouvent dans les préventes, dans ces projets qui surfent sur l’élan du marché pour exploser. Maxi Doge , avec sa folie assumée, et Best Wallet , avec son ambition utilitaire, représentent deux faces de la même opportunité. Ce sont des projets encore accessibles, qui se construisent dans l’ombre du mouvement institutionnel. Si vous voulez capter le vrai levier de rendement, il est là, à portée .",Altcoins|Bitcoin|Ethereum|altcoins|bitcoin|ETH,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|ALTCOIN|SHIB,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-01 11:30:04

The security firm reported that more than $163 million in digital assets was stolen across 16 incidents. According to PeckShield, the highlights of August crypto-related hacks included Turkish exchange BtcTurk, token launchpad ODIN.fun, lending protocol BetterBank, and CrediX Finance. BtcTurk suffers two hacks in 14 months On August 14, cybersecurity firm Cyvers detected unusual activity involving Ether and other tokens on several blockchain networks. At around 01:20 PM BST, Cyvers’ monitoring systems flagged large transactions on Ethereum , Avalanche, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Mantle, and Polygon. 🚨ALERT🚨$48M worth of digital assets have been detected in unusual activity across multiple chains involving Turkish exchange @btcturk About 30 minutes ago, our system detected multiple alerts across $ETH , $AVAX , $ARB , $BASE , $OP , $MANTLE , and $MATIC networks. Most funds were… pic.twitter.com/ss4a7O2hUd — 🚨 Cyvers Alerts 🚨 (@CyversAlerts) August 14, 2025 “Our system detected multiple alerts across ETH, AVAX, ARB, BASE, OP, MANTLE and MATIC networks,” the company reported. Investigators said the attacker moved stolen assets into two addresses and began the laundering process by swapping them. Almost 20 minutes later, BtcTurk suspended deposits and withdrawals by claiming there was a “technical issue” affecting its hot wallets. The exchange assured customers that local currency transfers and trading were unaffected, but did not confirm the total scale of losses. The hacking resulted in the theft of digital assets, including $48 million worth of Ether, according to Cyvers’ estimations. In another incident of the month, dated August 19, a Bitcoin holder lost 783 BTC, worth roughly $91 million, in a social engineering attack. This coincidentally fell on the one-year anniversary of the $240 million Genesis Creditor hack. Blockchain security sleuth ZachXBT said the attacker tricked the BTC investor into thinking they were customer support for a hardware wallet provider, which compelled the former to disclose private wallet credentials. The stolen Bitcoin was funneled through a Tornado Cash-like privacy tool called Wasabi Wallet, used to obscure the origins of illicit assets. DeFi exploits listed with BetterBank attack Over this past weekend, hackers drained about $5 million from PulseChain-based decentralized lending protocol BetterBank through a complex reward minting and liquidity manipulation attack. The perpetrators manipulated BetterBank’s ESTEEM reward system, which issued tokens when users provided liquidity for FAVOR. According to Web3 Security firm QuillAudits, the attackers created a fake ERC20 token paired with PDAIF, then manipulated trades through wash trading. Inflating ESTEEM rewards helped them convert the artificial supply into real assets, which inadvertently destabilized the pool. “The attacker laundered stolen funds through swaps on PulseChain DEXes and later bridged about $922K worth of ETH to Ethereum, hiding their trail via Tornado Cash,” QuillAudits noted . Odin.fun suffers $7 million liquidity manipulation In another attack, hackers targeted Odin.fun, a memecoin launchpad platform, draining 58.2 BTC, worth around $7 million, in under two hours. Blockchain data from PeckShield shows the platform’s reserves plunged from 291 BTC to 232.8 BTC during the incident. The exploit involved a liquidity pool manipulation in which attackers paired Bitcoin with a worthless token, SATOSHI. After exploiting the pool’s thin liquidity and inflating the token’s value through self-trading, they withdrew large amounts of real BTC at a fake price ratio. Odin.fun co-founder Bob Bodily revealed the platform had faced an attack and admitted the platform’s treasury was not large enough to absorb the losses. He said the team was working on a “concrete plan” to compensate affected users and had initiated a full audit with a security firm. “We have ideas … we’ll share details as soon as they are finalized,” Bodily posted on X. A Chainalysis report from July mentioned that the many crypto hacks in 2025 may be tied to Bitcoin’s price rise.

Recently, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi project with reported ties to the Trump family, ignited a significant stir. The project deleted a Medium post detailing its initial WLFI token supply just five minutes after publishing it. This swift and unexplained disappearance has left many in the crypto community perplexed, raising critical questions about the project’s commitment to openness and its long-term reliability. Such an incident immediately draws scrutiny, especially when a project is linked to prominent public figures, making the need for clear communication paramount. What Exactly Happened with the WLFI Token Supply Post? The deleted Medium post was not just a casual update; it contained specific and vital tokenomics data that investors often scrutinize. It reportedly stated that the initial WLFI token supply was approximately 24.669 billion tokens. For context, this is a substantial number, and the allocation details are crucial for understanding the project’s distribution and potential market dynamics. The post further broke down this initial supply: 10 billion tokens were earmarked for the ecosystem, presumably for development, partnerships, and community incentives. 7.784 billion tokens were allocated for liquidity and marketing efforts, essential for ensuring market stability and project visibility. Four billion tokens were designated for public sale participants, indicating the initial distribution method for early investors. The very quick deletion of such a detailed post, just minutes after it went live, immediately signals either a significant error in the published data or a sudden, deliberate change in strategy regarding the public disclosure of the WLFI token supply . This action, or rather, retraction, creates an air of mystery around the project’s foundational tokenomics. Why Was the WLFI Token Supply Information Deleted So Quickly? This is the central question that continues to echo through the crypto space. As of now, World Liberty Financial has not provided an official explanation for the rapid deletion of the post. This silence only amplifies speculation and concern. Was the information inaccurate? Was it prematurely released before final decisions were made? Or was there a strategic reason to pull back the specific details of the WLFI token supply from public view? In the fast-paced world of DeFi, transparency is not merely a buzzword; it’s a fundamental requirement for building trust. When a project linked to influential personalities makes such an abrupt move without immediate clarification, it inevitably invites suspicion. Investors and observers are left to wonder if the project is genuinely committed to open communication or if there are aspects of its token distribution that it prefers to keep private. The lack of clarity around the WLFI token supply figures can undermine confidence, impacting potential investor interest and the project’s credibility. The Impact of Secrecy on WLFI Token Supply and Investor Trust Actions like the sudden deletion of critical tokenomics data can have profound consequences for investor trust. In a decentralized ecosystem, participants rely heavily on verifiable, consistent information to make informed investment decisions. When a project’s communication around something as fundamental as its WLFI token supply appears erratic or secretive, it can quickly erode confidence. This incident, therefore, poses a significant challenge to World Liberty Financial’s reputation. For investors, the deletion raises red flags about the project’s stability and its adherence to best practices in the DeFi space. Trust is a fragile commodity in crypto, and any perceived attempt to obscure or retract information can lead to a loss of faith. Projects that aim for long-term success must prioritize clear, consistent, and readily accessible information, especially regarding their core economic models and token distribution. Navigating Transparency in DeFi: Lessons from WLFI Token Supply This incident offers valuable lessons for both emerging DeFi projects and individual investors. For projects, it underscores the absolute necessity of a well-thought-out communication strategy and meticulous review processes before publishing any critical information, particularly concerning tokenomics and the initial WLFI token supply . Any changes or retractions should be accompanied by immediate, clear explanations to maintain credibility. For investors, the situation with World Liberty Financial serves as a powerful reminder to: Conduct Thorough Due Diligence: Always dig deeper than initial announcements. Scrutinize Tokenomics: Understand how tokens are distributed, locked, and released. Watch for Red Flags: Inconsistent information, sudden deletions, or a lack of clear communication are warning signs. Diversify Investments: Never put all your eggs in one basket, especially with projects that exhibit unusual behavior. The DeFi landscape is full of opportunities, but it also carries inherent risks. Vigilance and a critical approach are essential to navigate it successfully. The Mysterious WLFI Token Supply Deletion: A Concluding Thought The mysterious deletion of the WLFI token supply post by World Liberty Financial remains a puzzling event. While the specific reasons behind this action are still unconfirmed, the incident highlights a crucial aspect of the decentralized finance world: the indispensable role of transparency. In an environment built on trustless systems, the trust placed in project teams becomes even more critical. This episode underscores the ongoing need for projects to uphold open communication and for investors to remain ever-vigilant and discerning in their choices. As the DeFi space continues to mature, incidents like these serve as important case studies, reminding everyone that clarity and consistency are paramount for sustainable growth and investor confidence.

51014001,570539,1756726216,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51014001.jpeg,Bitcoin Cycle Extremes Index Hits 8.8%: Compression Phase Signals Expansion Ahead,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-cycle-extremes-index-8-8-compression-phase/,"Bitcoin is trading at a critical level after losing the $110,000 support, a zone that had previously provided bulls with a strong defensive line. The recent breakdown underscores fading momentum, as buyers struggle to regain control following weeks of volatility. Since breaking above its all-time high, BTC has shown no meaningful signs of recovery, fueling speculation that the market could be entering a deeper corrective phase. Selling pressure continues to mount, and investors are now focused on whether Bitcoin can stabilize before further downside tests. Despite the bearish tone in price action, onchain data paints a more nuanced picture. According to CryptoQuant, the Bitcoin network is currently in a compression phase. Historically, these phases act as precursors to expansion periods marked by heightened volatility and large directional moves. This pattern suggests that while short-term conditions appear weak, the groundwork is being laid for the next significant swing in market structure. The coming days will be decisive. Bulls must reclaim key levels to avoid further capitulation, while bears see room for another leg down. Either way, the compression phase indicates that a major breakout—up or down—could be approaching, making Bitcoin’s current position one of high stakes and high anticipation. Bitcoin Cycle Extremes Index Signals Compression Phase Crypto Analyst Axel Adler has recently shared insights into the Adjusted Bitcoin Cycle Extremes Index, a tool designed to measure market conditions based on volatility within halving cycles. The index combines several key on-chain metrics—SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio), MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value), NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss), and NVT (Network Value to Transactions)—to provide a broader picture of where Bitcoin stands in its cycle. At present, the index is reading 8.8%, which places Bitcoin firmly within a bottom zone close to compression. Historically, such compression phases have acted as precursors to expansion, where price and network activity experience heightened volatility and directional moves. In simple terms, the market is currently in a quiet stage, storing energy for the next major shift. Analysts are divided on what comes next. Some argue that this compression marks the end of the bull cycle, one that began in 2023 and delivered over 600% gains from its lows. From this perspective, Bitcoin’s recent loss of momentum and inability to hold above $110K may be early signs of a prolonged corrective phase. On the other hand, a growing camp of analysts sees this compression not as an ending but as a launchpad for the next leg higher. With institutional inflows, global adoption, and whale accumulation still strong, they believe Bitcoin could surprise the market by pushing further into uncharted territory. Ultimately, the compression-to-expansion dynamic suggests that the coming months will be decisive. Whether this phase resolves in a bullish continuation or the beginning of a macro correction, Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment that will define the next chapter of its cycle. Bulls Hold Demand Amid Bearish Pressure Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading around $109,697, showing modest recovery after recently dipping below the critical $110K support. The chart highlights how BTC remains under heavy selling pressure, with price action struggling to regain momentum following the rejection near $123K, a level that marked the most recent local top. The daily moving averages emphasize the market’s fragile state. The 50-day SMA is beginning to slope downward, while the 100-day SMA hovers near $111,700, acting as a resistance barrier. If BTC fails to reclaim this level, sellers could push the price back toward the 200-day SMA around $101,300, which represents the next major support zone. Market structure suggests BTC is in a consolidation-to-correction phase. The sharp decline from August highs signals fading bullish strength, and despite attempts at recovery, the price remains capped below short-term resistance. Bulls must reclaim $112K–$115K to shift momentum; otherwise, continued weakness could invite deeper tests of $105K–$101K. Bitcoin sits in a make-or-break zone, where holding above $109K could stabilize sentiment. However, without strong buying support, the risk of another leg lower persists, especially if broader market volatility continues to weigh on risk assets.

Bitcoin OG Whale Still Rotates Into ETH On-chain sleuth “MLM” has chronicled the flows in real time. In the most recent 46-hour window, the address cluster associated with the trader sold 7,000 BTC (≈$759 million at reference prices used by MLM) and bought 171,791.84 ETH (≈$773 million). MLM added that 3,000 BTC remained in the actively used source address—likely earmarked for further rotation—while two older wallets still held a combined 46,816 BTC (≈$5.07 billion). Cumulatively across the past 11 days, MLM tallied 34,110 BTC sold (≈$3.7 billion) and 813,298.84 ETH purchased (≈$3.66 billion), using $108,400 per BTC and $4,500 per ETH as baseline pricing for comparability. The execution venue has become part of the story. Hyperliquid’s public explorer (HypurrScan) shows heavy activity at the Hyperliquid account cited by MLM, corresponding with phased BTC deposits and batched ETH withdrawals. “MoonOverlord”—a trader—downplayed the mystery around the venue choice: “idk why it’s bizarre? it’s a trade, he picked the best venue.” MLM replied that the oddity is not the platform but that “the identity of this person is unknown, and he decided to swap such a large amount of BTC to ETH, which is unusual for a ‘og’ bitcoin whale.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Deeper Losses If $107,800 Line Fails To Hold – Details Arkham Intelligence independently flagged the same entity, writing: “THIS WHALE JUST BOUGHT $430M OF ETH – AND STILL HAS $650M LEFT TO BUY,” and identifying specific addresses on both chains. According to Arkham, the whale “has purchased over $3 BILLION of ETH in total and staked the majority of it,” with flows linking a BTC source wallet beginning “169q…” and an ETH receiver “0x6167…”. Those staking claims are now visible on-chain. On September 1, funding flows from 0x6167… led to a “Beacon Depositor” account that submitted a series of deposit transactions totaling 165,010 ETH to Ethereum’s staking contract, with dozens of 30,000 ETH-sized and 15,010 ETH-sized deposit calls posted within the same hour. The deposit contract view and the funding trail from 0x6167… corroborate that a substantial slice of the newly acquired ETH has moved directly into staking. On the Bitcoin side, the active source wallet “169q…” and two long-idle companion wallets “17MWd…” and “12Xqe…” anchor the cluster that MLM has been tracking since last week. Mempool records show recent inter-wallet activity and outputs from 169q… consistent with the staged deposits to Hyperliquid described in the thread. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Closes Below STH Realized Price For The 2nd Time In 2025 — Details The trader’s provenance is still speculative. MLM argues the entity is “presumably Asian,” noting that the original BTC was accumulated seven to eight years ago via Asia-linked platforms and miners—“HTX, OKX, ViaBTC (a mining pool), Bixin (a miner), and Binance.” But MLM cautioned readers not to over-interpret intent: “Of course, don’t take this prediction as financial advice, since it’s all speculation for now and we don’t know the intentions of this whale.” $5 Billion Selloff Still Looms While commentators are debating motives, the mechanics are clear: staged BTC funding to a single trading venue, piecemeal ETH fills to minimize slippage, rapid withdrawals to self-custody, and swift conversion of a large portion to staked ETH. The cadence of deposits and withdrawals—some clustered over weekends—also lines up with timing observations in MLM’s logs and Arkham’s updates. What remains uncertain is how much further the rotation will go. MLM’s running ledger suggested that at least several thousand BTC were still poised to move: “Additionally, there’s another combined 46.816 BTC ($5.07B) across these wallets: 17MWd [and] 12Xqeq. Of this, another 14.495 BTC ($1.57B) might get rotated based on previous activity, though it’s unclear what will happen with the remaining 32.321 BTC ($3.5B). At this point, it looks like he is rotating everything lol.” At press time, BTC traded at $109,621.

Both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) followed suit, leaving traders frustrated as hopes for a rally faded. With majors consolidating, newer plays like Layer Brett ($LBRETT) are drawing attention from investors hunting fresh opportunities. Bitcoin price under pressure The latest dip in the Bitcoin Price saw BTC slide back into the low $108,000s after failing to hold above the $110,000–$112,000 resistance zone. Traders note that this region has become a ceiling, with every attempt at a breakout quickly reversed. Momentum has cooled, and short-term sentiment is cautious as many now expect more sideways action before any rebound. Still, Bitcoin’s role as the market leader hasn’t changed. Institutions continue to add exposure, treating it as a hedge and long-term store of value. For now, though, the lack of a strong catalyst has left BTC consolidating, and that slowdown is filtering into altcoins across the board. Dogecoin struggles to find momentum The weakness in Dogecoin (DOGE) mirrors the broader market. DOGE had been showing signs of stabilizing, but Bitcoin’s drop dragged it back down. Liquidity remains strong, and DOGE still enjoys one of the largest communities in crypto. That loyal base is its biggest strength, yet traders are looking for a catalyst to reignite a rally. Without fresh momentum, DOGE risks drifting in a tight range. Analysts highlight that whales are holding, but retail enthusiasm is clearly lower than during past meme coin surges. Until sentiment improves, DOGE may find it hard to deliver big moves. Cardano slips under pressure Cardano (ADA) also felt the impact of Bitcoin’s correction. The Cardano Price is hovering just below $0.90, with buyers trying to hold support before a deeper drop. ADA’s careful, research-driven development has kept its ecosystem relevant, but traders are increasingly impatient. Many expected stronger price action after its Hydra scaling upgrade, yet progress has been slow to reflect in the charts. For long-term holders, ADA’s steady development and security-first approach are still positives. But like DOGE, it needs a spark. Without one, ADA could continue to lag as traders rotate into faster-moving assets. Why Layer Brett is gaining attention As Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Cardano trade sideways, many investors are rotating into newer tokens. One of the biggest beneficiaries of this shift is Layer Brett ($LBRETT), a meme token built on Ethereum Layer 2. Unlike most meme plays, it combines viral culture with utility. The presale is live, with tokens priced at entry-level valuations. Early buyers are locking in massive staking rewards, running into the thousands of percent APY, which has fueled excitement across trading communities. Beyond staking, $LBRETT plans NFT tie-ins, gamified features, and cross-chain compatibility, giving it a roadmap designed for long-term engagement. With a capped supply of 10 billion tokens, scarcity is also built into the model. Traders see this as a major advantage compared to inflationary meme coins. Some even believe $LBRETT could follow in the footsteps of Shiba Inu or Dogecoin’s early runs, but with stronger tech behind it from the start. Final thoughts The Bitcoin Price continues to weigh heavily on the market, pulling down altcoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) in the process. While all three remain important parts of the crypto landscape, near-term gains look limited unless fresh catalysts emerge. That’s why many investors are paying closer attention to presale opportunities like Layer Brett ($LBRETT). With Ethereum Layer 2 scalability, high staking rewards, and meme-driven energy, it is being positioned as a high-upside alternative while the majors consolidate. For traders chasing momentum, $LBRETT may prove to be one of the most talked-about tokens of 2025.

The rally was triggered after Trump posted on Truth Social that prices in the United States were “WAY DOWN” and that inflation was virtually nonexistent. His remarks appeared to stoke investor interest in gold as a traditional safe-haven asset. Gold Surges Amid Inflation Remarks The spike comes after years of tight correlation between gold, Bitcoin, and the Nasdaq. IG market analyst Tony Sycamore noted that while the three assets have generally moved higher together, gold and BTC have recently diverged. “This isn’t uncommon for brief periods and comes due to Bitcoin’s split personality,” Sycamore said, adding that Bitcoin is sometimes treated as a store of value and at other times as a risk asset. BTC price action told a different story. The cryptocurrency dropped to $107,290 on Coinbase Monday morning, its lowest point since early July. The decline marked a 13% correction from its mid-August all-time high, making it the steepest pullback in weeks. Analysts Split on Bitcoin-Gold Correlation The breakdown in correlation between gold and Bitcoin has been evident throughout 2025. Vince Yang, co-founder of Ethereum layer-2 platform zkLink, noted that BTC has been “more tied to liquidity and market risk,” while gold remains the default safe haven. “Basically, they balance each other out rather than run side by side,” Yang explained. Still, some analysts believe the relationship may reassert itself. Sycamore suggested that if Trump pursues policies that heat up the U.S. economy while the Federal Reserve cuts rates into persistent inflation, Bitcoin could once again track gold’s upward momentum . “It’s just a question from what level Bitcoin finds its toehold,” he said. Historical precedent appears to support this view. When gold hit new highs above $2,000 during the pandemic in 2020, Bitcoin followed with a surge to record levels the following year. Joe Consorti, head of growth at Theya, has argued that BTC tends to follow gold’s directional bias with a lag of 100 to 150 days.

Yet, not every token is showing weakness. Solana (SOL) continues to attract strong developer activity, while the presale buzz around Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is growing louder. Whales appear to be rotating capital, with reports suggesting that many are adding both SOL and $LBRETT to their portfolios despite broader volatility. Solana holding firm Solana has been trading near $178, holding its ground even as Bitcoin struggles. Known for its low fees and fast block times, it has become a preferred chain for DeFi, NFTs, and gaming applications. Activity has remained steady, with developers launching new projects despite market uncertainty. Institutional interest has also been notable. Several funds have been increasing exposure to SOL as an alternative to Ethereum, citing its efficiency and ability to scale applications. Analysts say that if Solana can maintain momentum, a push back toward $200 is possible in the near term. The fact that it continues to generate consistent network usage while other tokens dip has reinforced its position as a top altcoin. Bitcoin under pressure The Bitcoin Price has slipped back to around $108,627, after failing to hold above $112,820. Traders say the range near $110,000–$112,000 has become a ceiling. Every attempt higher has been met with quick selling. Some short-term holders have been moving coins to exchanges, signaling caution. Long-term investors, however, remain calm and continue to view BTC as a hedge and store of value. Institutional flows into ETFs have also slowed, reflecting a wait-and-see approach. For now, momentum looks limited, and many expect Bitcoin to stay range-bound until new market drivers appear. Why whales are watching Layer Brett While majors like Bitcoin and Solana consolidate, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) has been gathering strong presale demand. Built on Ethereum Layer 2, it combines meme-driven energy with real blockchain mechanics such as low fees and faster speeds. This gives it more credibility than meme tokens that rely only on hype. The presale has been attracting both retail buyers and larger holders, thanks to staking rewards running into the thousands of percent APY. The roadmap includes NFT integrations, gamified staking, and cross-chain features designed to sustain interest after launch. With a capped supply of 10 billion tokens, scarcity is also built in, giving traders confidence that supply pressure will remain limited. For many investors, $LBRETT offers a mix of culture and utility. Some analysts argue it could replicate early runs seen in Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, but with a stronger technical foundation. That potential is why it has become one of the most discussed tokens in trading circles heading into 2025. Final thoughts The recent Bitcoin pullback has cooled sentiment, but Solana’s resilience shows that active networks can still attract users and capital. SOL’s ecosystem remains one of the most dynamic in the market, proving it is more than just price action. At the same time, Layer Brett’s presale momentum is capturing attention from traders who want high-upside opportunities. With Ethereum Layer 2 scalability, staking, and meme culture behind it, $LBRETT has carved out a niche in a consolidating market. For investors, the split is clear: Bitcoin and Solana offer stability, while Layer Brett delivers speculative upside. How traders balance these choices could define the next phase of the crypto cycle.

51014807,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=796432,1756727107,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51014807.jpeg,Chinese automakers expand European presence as US market turns hostile,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/chinese-automakers-direct-to-europe/,"Chinese automakers are intensifying their focus on Europe for their electric vehicle (EV) and hybrid exports as they continue to face high tariffs and trade restrictions in the United States under Trump administration policies. According to a Bloomberg report, China’s automakers are preparing a new crop of hybrid and all-electric vehicles specifically for the Europe market, and they plan to use next week’s Munich auto show to kick off the next phase of their expansion in the region. Among brands to be represented at the show are BYD Co., Xpeng Inc. and Zhejiang Leapmotor Technology Co., and they are expected to show off new models as they work to broaden their lineups and double down on the gains they have made in recent years. A marriage of function and convenience This push into Europe is intensifying as an EV price war grows more intense on the Chinese home turf, and the once lucrative US market becomes a hostile battleground due to trade hurdles. Despite all that, this time is perfect for the expansion as EVs and hybrids are growing in importance in alignment with Europe’s desire to phase out the sales of new combustion-powered cars over the next decade. There are currently lingering trade tensions between Beijing and the EU following their decision last year to impose tariffs on EVs imported from China but Chinese automakers have continued to grow anyway. Not only have they come up with ways to add more hybrid and combustion models without triggering the duties, they have also formed local sales partnerships and committed to transfer some production to the region. All that has made them credible threats to the dominance of carmakers like Volkswagen AG and Stellantis NV, which have been cutting costs to defend their margins in a barely growing European auto market. The tariffs have also spurred collaboration, as Chinese manufacturers work together to navigate the new rules while European firms link up with Chinese rivals to stay ahead in areas like software and battery technology. Will the US auto industry suffer following the shift? Chinese automakers previously considered the US a lucrative market. However, since Trump stepped in with his policies, it has become more difficult for them to do business and thrive. Some argue that China’s automakers shifting their attention to Europe will cost the American people, but Trump clearly hopes that local companies can step up as worthy replacements. However, the president’s plan has some hurdles to overcome in the form of division in the US courts. It also just happens that the majority of the automakers in the US specialize in regular vehicles. President Trump and his Republican Party have also proposed cuts to electric vehicle incentives, which experts believe could significantly hinder American car manufacturers’ competitiveness against their Chinese counterparts. Tesla is currently the only American company ranked among the world’s 10 largest electric vehicle makers, but even Musk has lost ground to BYD and Geely, according to recent reports. Europe has shown a willingness to deal with China over the years, and that has become even more apparent in the face of Trump’s tariffs. This means more cars will be produced and exported to consumers there. Already U.S. automakers have steadily lost ground in Asia, Europe and Latin America in recent years with many consumers in those countries instead buying cars from Chinese companies as they offer a wide array of affordable electric and hybrid vehicles. General Motors (GM) and Ford now earn a large majority of their profits in the United States and analysts have said their global sales could be reduced to rounding errors in the coming years if current trends persist. “The United States needs to decide if they want an auto industry that can compete globally,” said Greg Dotson, an associate professor at the University of Oregon School of Law and former Democratic chief counsel for the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.

According to CoinMarketCap CEO Rush Lu, WLFI’s initial circulating supply has been verified directly with the project team and will be used as a benchmark for major exchanges. Updated data on CoinMarketCap indicates WLFI will debut with 27 billion tokens in circulation, representing more than a quarter of its 100 billion total supply. 来了来了，老板们。WLFI的流通数据是我们反复与项目方确认的。币安及其它交易所也采用此数据。 https://t.co/f5tEgA2iH2 — Rush (@RushCMC) September 1, 2025 This disclosure sharply contrasts earlier reports suggesting that just 3.69 billion tokens would be available at the token generation event (TGE). The dramatic increase in supply raises new questions about WLFI’s early price dynamics, potential dilution, and how markets will absorb such a large float from day one. Token Movements Linked to Jump Crypto On-chain activity has already shed light on how WLFI liquidity may be structured. With X user @ai_9684xtpa highlighted that WLFI transferred 485 million tokens—about 0.485% of total supply—to two wallets linked with Jump Crypto. 更新：过去 10 分钟，WLFI 官方多签向 Jump Crypto 的两个地址转移总计 4.85 亿枚做市代币 占代币总供应量的 0.485%，占 Dylan 提到「CEX 流动性 + DEX LP」30 亿枚部分的 16.2% https://t.co/63YHrRa1ij https://t.co/tl5U0T2igp pic.twitter.com/8DtHc6zSha — Ai 姨 (@ai_9684xtpa) September 1, 2025 These allocations are believed to be designated for market-making purposes, supporting liquidity across centralized and decentralized exchanges. Importantly, the transfer represents 16.2% of the three billion tokens allocated to exchange liquidity pools at launch. Jump Crypto has recently stepped up its involvement in digital asset trading, particularly since Trump’s return to the White House. The firm’s participation in WLFI suggests that early trading may benefit from deep liquidity, though it also amplifies questions about concentration of supply in the hands of key market makers. Market Reactions and Investor Sentiment The revelation of a 27 billion token float has stirred mixed reactions among traders and analysts. A larger circulating supply at launch often implies heavier initial selling pressure and a lower starting price per token. While this could make WLFI appear cheaper to retail investors, it also increases the risk of volatility and rapid repricing. Some observers argue that the higher supply may be part of a strategy to ensure WLFI achieves wide distribution early on, reducing the impact of later unlocks. Others remain cautious, suggesting the surprise disclosure may undermine initial confidence and lead to speculation about governance transparency. WLFI Derivatives Explode 500% World Liberty Financial derivatives soared in trading as anticipation builds for the Trump-linked project’s first token release on Monday. According to Coinglass , 24-hour trading volume for WLFI derivatives jumped more than 530% to $3.95b on Monday, while open interest rose over 60% $931.9m. The spike comes just hours before the unlock event, scheduled for 8:00 a.m. ET. The project will free up 20% of the tokens purchased in its earliest rounds, priced at $0.015 and US$0.05, which can be claimed through a process called the Lockbox. These unlocked tokens amount to about 5% of total supply. Outlook for WLFI’s Debut WLFI’s launch is shaping up to be one of the most closely watched token events of 2025. The project sits at the intersection of politics, finance, and crypto market infrastructure, making it unique among recent token launches. With Jump Crypto’s involvement and CoinMarketCap’s confirmation of supply data, WLFI is expected to generate significant trading volumes from day one. However, the mismatch between earlier expectations and the confirmed circulating supply means that investors will need to carefully monitor price discovery and liquidity conditions as the token hits the market. As with many politically charged crypto ventures, WLFI’s debut will be as much about narrative and sentiment as it is about tokenomics.

Both meme coins, once fueled by viral community energy, are now seeing large holders offload positions, shaking short-term confidence. At the same time, Layer Brett ($LBRETT), a meme coin built on Ethereum Layer 2, is becoming the latest obsession in trading circles. Its mix of meme appeal and scalable infrastructure has helped it go viral while older tokens slow down. Shiba Inu struggles to hold ground Shiba Inu has long been supported by its strong community and projects like Shibarium. But even loyal tokens can feel the strain when whales sell in bulk. A recent dump of over 200 billion SHIB raised concerns, and with nearly 40% of the supply sitting in one wallet, many see risk if selling pressure continues. SHIB is trading near $0.000012, just above its support level around $0.00001212, while resistance remains at $0.00001269. Long-term holders point to ongoing token burns and ecosystem growth as positives, but short-term sentiment is cautious. Without a fresh catalyst, SHIB could drift sideways while traders chase momentum elsewhere. Pepe Coin shows mixed signals Pepe Coin was one of 2024’s biggest meme coin success stories, but its price action is showing strain as well. After a strong rally, whales started locking in profits. Some early buyers made millions, and though a few have re-entered, large trades continue to weigh on price. At the moment, PEPE is changing hands around $0.00000120, still well above its lows but below recent highs. The rise in trading volume and derivatives activity suggests speculation is still high, but holders remain divided. For some, it’s a sign of long-term strength. For others, it shows the token may be more hype-driven than sustainable. Why Layer Brett is getting attention While Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin feel the weight of whale activity, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is gaining steam. Traders see this as a crucial difference, since meme tokens on congested networks often stall when demand spikes. The presale has already generated excitement, with early buyers locking in tokens at entry prices. Staking rewards in the thousands of percent APY have added fuel to the buzz, making it one of the most talked-about presales this year. Beyond the hype, the team has mapped out NFT tie-ins, gamified staking features, and cross-chain compatibility, aiming to keep the project active well past its launch. A capped supply of 10 billion tokens also introduces scarcity from day one. This, combined with Ethereum Layer 2 infrastructure, gives $LBRETT a structure that many argue SHIB and PEPE never had when they first went viral. The idea of combining meme energy with real usability is what has traders calling $LBRETT a potential breakout for 2025. Final thoughts The meme coin market is shifting. Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin still command name recognition, but whale exits and slowing price momentum are creating doubts. Meanwhile, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is generating excitement by offering something new, a meme-driven appeal combined with scalable blockchain mechanics. For traders chasing the next big win, it has become a strong contender. For now, the choice is clear: hold onto familiar meme names with established communities, or take a chance on a new token designed with both culture and technical strength. With the market watching closely, $LBRETT may prove to be the story that defines the next meme coin cycle.

Analysts are closely watching whether Ripple’s native token can reclaim bullish momentum, with some pointing to a potential move toward $2.92 as the next key inflection point. Analysts Split as XRP Tests Support On August 31, trader CrediBULL Crypto told followers on X that if XRP’s recent lows remain firm, a move toward the $2.92 swing high is plausible. However, this zone is also identified as a likely area for a price rejection. “Clear that, and we have a full-on reversal on our hands,” CrediBULL said. Hours later, he noted he had exited his position, citing concerns of downside liquidity hunting due to Ethereum weakness. This cautious outlook was reflected in recent trading, as XRP’s value fell to $2.73 on August 30, a low not seen since the start of that month. Meanwhile, another community figure, CryptoBull, projected a far more ambitious target of $7–$8 on a monthly chart pattern. These predictions come against a backdrop of mixed developments for XRP. As CryptoPotato recently reported, the XRP Ledger finished Q2 2025 with a record $131.6 million in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), with contributions from major firms like Guggenheim and Ondo. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin also grew nearly 50% quarter-on-quarter, becoming the network’s largest dollar-pegged asset. However, daily transactions and active addresses fell sharply, reflecting a short-term decline in engagement. Adding fuel to speculation, former U.S. Senate candidate John E. Deaton has said that ETF inflows could “ surprise many ” once the SEC approves XRP-based products. With at least 15 active filings, including Amplify ETFs’ application for a Monthly Option Income product, the possibility of fresh institutional exposure has strengthened community optimism. Market Outlook XRP has struggled to maintain its footing since peaking at $3.65 on July 18. Data from CoinGecko shows the token changing hands at $2.72 at the time of this writing. It means the asset is down 4% in the last 24 hours and 9.1% over the week. In that time, XRP has swung between $2.72 and $3.05, underlining persistent volatility. The monthly picture is also just as weak, with a 9.7% drop. However, the token is still up 386% year-on-year. And while its 24-hour trading volume remains strong at $4.78 billion, its market cap has slipped to $162.4 billion, placing it behind Tether’s USDT, which recently overtook it for the number 3 spot.

However, the rise of artificial intelligence – now more mature after numerous trials and tribulations – has been a godsend for both novices and experienced traders alike. Trading bots like Coinrule and 3Commas, for example, can execute orders instantly, free from the emotional decision-making that often trips up human traders. Meanwhile, platforms like Incite AI can generate actionable insights by analyzing and interpreting data from multiple sources, including news publications, real-time exchange data, and social media buzz, giving you a clearer view of overall market direction. To fully harness the power of AI and use it to strengthen your crypto portfolio, we asked Grok about the best cryptos to buy now . Read on as we unpack AI’s role in crypto, how it’s outperforming human analysts, and Grok’s top investment picks. Why AI’s Real-Time Insights Are a Game-Changer for Altcoin Picks According to a recent report, AI is better at suggesting diversified portfolios to manage market volatility. For example, AI tools recommended a mix of large-cap coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, mid-cap cryptos such as Solana and Cardano, and stablecoins to avoid concentration risk. The best part? This portfolio outperformed those not diversified by AI by a whopping 15%. Similarly, crypto hedge funds that leverage AI analysis delivered an average return of 48% – 12-15% higher than traditional approaches. Crypto markets are highly dynamic. By the time you make sense of one data set, another one appears. This is where quantitative models like multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) prove invaluable. AI models like Grok can analyze interconnected factors such as technological, financial, and geopolitical risks in the crypto markets in real time. And speaking of Grok, it’s worth highlighting its direct integration with X, which gives it instant access to all the latest crypto-related updates, from tweets by prominent voices to company announcements and analyst chart posts. This not only saves you a huge amount of legwork, but also provides access to highly niche data that would otherwise take days to surface manually. Want in? Here are the 3 top altcoins Grok is watching right now. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – New Telegram Trading Bot Swiping Meme Coin Liquidity Snorter Token ($SNORT) is the official cryptocurrency of the Snorter Telegram trading bot, designed to simplify meme coin investing for small traders. Until now, large institutions have typically swiped away all the liquidity in new meme coins using advanced algorithms and sophisticated tools. The Snorter bot changes that by allowing you to place buy/sell limit and stop orders directly through its slick Telegram interface. Next, it automatically executes those orders at lightning speed the moment liquidity becomes available in a token, putting you on par with whales. One of the bot’s biggest strengths is its robust security infrastructure. It employs MEV-resistant layers to protect you from scams like honeypots and rug pulls. Plus, none of the transactions on the bot are sent to the mempool, so they remain invisible to malicious third parties and you’re shielded from sandwich attacks. Buying $SNORT unlocks exclusive perks such as advanced market analysis, no daily sniping limits, and reduced trading fees – just 0.85% compared to 1.5% for non-holders. Currently in presale, Snorter Token has already raised over $3.63M, with each token currently priced at $0.1031. And according to our $SNORT price prediction , the token could surge to $0.94 in 2025 alone – delivering mind-melting gains of nearly 800%. Visit Snorter Token’s official website for more information. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – First-Ever Crypto Content Platform Offering Tons of AI Tools SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is the native token of the SUBBD platform, which aims to transform the $85B content creation industry. Right now, mainstream platforms charge as much as 70% of creators’ revenues as platform fees, leaving them with almost nothing. SUBBD, on the other hand, takes only a fraction of earnings as fees. Beyond fairer revenue sharing, the platform also adds utility by offering AI-powered tools, including video, text, image, and audio generators. So, creators can spend less time managing content and more time engaging with their audiences to build meaningful connections. Buying $SUBBD also brings a lot of benefits for viewers. You can unlock exclusive creator content, request custom content, and even tip your favorite creators using the token. And, of course, the ROI potential is massive, too. According to our $SUBBD price prediction , a $100 investment today could grow to $500 by year’s end. Plus, unlike other presale projects that offer dynamic staking rewards, SUBBD provides a fixed 20% APY for the first year, ensuring consistent passive income. Even better, staking also unlocks exclusive behind-the-scenes (BTS) content, creator livestreams, and premium in-house productions. The $SUBBD presale has already raised $1.08M, with each token currently priced at just $0.056325. Check out SUBBD Token’s official website for more information. 3. Ethereum ($ETH) – OG Cryptocurrency Drying up Exchange Reserves Ethereum ($ETH) has been buzzing over the past few weeks. The token teased the $5K mark on August 24 and has been consolidating since then. Overall, Ethereum has surged by more than 75% since the beginning of July, steadily building strong bullish momentum. As per reports and on-chain data, several $BTC whales are now quietly building long positions in $ETH. For example, one crypto whale sold more than 2,000 $BTC and bought 886,371 $ETH worth over $4B . Meanwhile, the World Liberty Financial token ($WLFI), a Trump-backed crypto investment company, is also set to make its exchange debut on Monday. Interestingly, $ETH makes up more than 66% of WLFI’s total holdings , amounting to $328.20M. Data from CryptoQuant shows that $ETH exchange reserves are dipping fast and are now at record lows. This signals that institutions, whales, and even retailers are stacking up on $ETH, creating strong buying pressure and a bullish backdrop that could push Ethereum to new highs. Ethereum looks promising on the technical front, too. It’s moving in a bullish channel with key resistance only around the $4,900 level. Once $ETH crosses the psychological $5K threshold, experts believe we could see it soar to $7,500 or more by year-end. Final Thoughts Using AI for crypto analysis, trading, and portfolio building can be a game changer, as these models can identify potential multibaggers early in their life cycle, before the crowd catches on. And this isn’t just speculation. We tested Grok hands-on, and it delivered a solid mix of low-cap and established tokens for a well-balanced portfolio. Grok’s top 3 suggestions include Snorter Token ($SNORT) , SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) , and Ethereum ($ETH). That said, investing in cryptocurrencies comes with inherent market risks. This isn’t financial advice, so always do your own research before investing any money.

This DeFi project, notably connected to the Trump family, has re-posted crucial details about its initial WLFI token supply . This event comes after a previous post was swiftly removed, adding an intriguing twist to the narrative for investors and enthusiasts alike. What Exactly Happened with the WLFI Token Supply Announcement? World Liberty Financial initially shared information regarding its WLFI token supply , only to delete the post just five minutes later. However, in a move towards renewed transparency, the project has now officially re-published these important details. This re-posting underscores the project’s commitment to clarity, especially given its high-profile associations. According to the recent announcement, the initial total supply of WLFI tokens stands at approximately 24.669 billion. This substantial figure is strategically distributed across various essential functions to support the project’s ecosystem and growth. Ecosystem Allocation: A significant 10 billion tokens are dedicated to the ecosystem. This portion is vital for developing and sustaining the WLFI platform, funding future initiatives, and fostering community growth. Liquidity and Marketing: Around 7.784 billion tokens are earmarked for liquidity and marketing efforts. These tokens are crucial for ensuring market stability, facilitating trading, and promoting the WLFI brand to a broader audience. Public Sale Participants: Four billion tokens have been allocated to participants of the public sale. This distribution mechanism allows early supporters to become stakeholders in the project. Understanding these allocations is key for anyone following the project. It provides insight into how the WLFI team plans to manage its digital assets and build a sustainable platform. Why is Understanding WLFI Token Supply So Important for Investors? For any cryptocurrency project, the initial WLFI token supply and its distribution plan, often referred to as tokenomics, are fundamental. They offer a window into the project’s long-term vision and financial health. A well-structured token distribution can indicate stability and a thoughtful approach to market dynamics. When a project, especially one with high visibility, re-posts such vital information, it can signal a commitment to transparency. This action helps build trust within the community, which is paramount in the often-volatile crypto space. Investors typically scrutinize these details to assess potential market capitalization, scarcity, and future value propositions. Moreover, the allocation for liquidity and marketing is particularly telling. Adequate liquidity ensures that traders can buy and sell tokens efficiently without significant price slippage. Simultaneously, robust marketing is essential for increasing adoption and bringing new users into the ecosystem. Therefore, these figures directly impact the project’s reach and operational efficiency. What Challenges and Opportunities Does This WLFI Token Supply Reveal? The initial deletion and subsequent re-posting of the WLFI token supply details highlight the inherent challenges of communication in the fast-paced DeFi sector. It emphasizes the need for projects to maintain consistent and accurate information from the outset. In an environment where investor confidence can shift rapidly, clear communication is an invaluable asset. However, this re-posting also presents an opportunity. By openly sharing these figures, World Liberty Financial can re-establish trust and demonstrate its dedication to an open development process. For participants, understanding the specific allocations allows for more informed decision-making, whether they are current holders or potential investors. The ecosystem allocation, for instance, suggests a focus on sustainable growth and future development. This could translate into new features, partnerships, and expanded utility for the WLFI token. Furthermore, the public sale allocation ensures a decentralized ownership structure, which is a cornerstone of many successful DeFi projects. Looking Ahead: The Impact of WLFI Token Supply Transparency The re-disclosure of the WLFI token supply details is a significant moment for World Liberty Financial. It moves the project towards greater transparency, which is always a positive development in the cryptocurrency industry. As the DeFi landscape continues to evolve, projects that prioritize clear communication and robust tokenomics are often those that garner long-term support and success. This event serves as a reminder that while the crypto market is innovative, it also demands accountability. Projects must consistently provide accurate information to their communities to foster a healthy and thriving ecosystem. The WLFI community will undoubtedly be watching closely to see how these token allocations translate into tangible project developments and market performance. In Conclusion: Navigating the WLFI Token Supply Landscape World Liberty Financial’s re-posting of its WLFI token supply details marks a pivotal step in its journey. By clarifying the initial token distribution – including allocations for the ecosystem, liquidity, marketing, and public sale – the project has provided essential information for its community.

Ripple has bounced from key support, and Chainlink’s climb toward $30 has caught the eye of technical traders. But neither has created the buzz BlockDAG is generating. XRP’s support at $2.80 held firm, calming talk of a deeper slide. LINK’s 17% move upward has fueled hope for a breakout, yet all eyes are shifting elsewhere. BlockDAG is pulling attention by going beyond price speculation and showing what’s already built. With $388M raised, a current Batch 30 price of $0.03, and a $0.05 confirmed launch, BlockDAG ’s traction is backed by delivery. The debut of its X1 and X10 miners, combined with daily Buyer Battles and 20 exchange listings, is separating it from coins that rely only on charts or ETF buzz. XRP Rebounds Off Crucial $2.80 Level Ripple (XRP) bulls have stepped up at the $2.80 mark, flipping what looked like a downside risk into a fresh bounce. The price has since moved near $3.01, a signal that buyers are still in charge. Holding this zone keeps XRP’s short-term uptrend alive, and analysts are keeping an eye on the $3.10 and $3.50 range as potential next stops. Volume has picked up following the bounce, and that uptick in activity is encouraging. As long as $2.80 stays intact, XRP remains in bullish territory. A fall below that level could shift the outlook, but for now, the structure favors another leg higher. This zone is now seen as a key battleground. Market watchers say that as long as XRP trades above $2.80, confidence will likely grow, keeping the door open for continued upward moves. The next few sessions could be crucial in determining whether the rally sustains or runs out of steam. LINK Pushes Higher After 17% Weekly Surge Chainlink (LINK) is pushing upward with strong momentum, logging a 17% weekly gain and hovering just under $27. Backed by a solid base at $25, LINK’s bounce has been supported by a massive 83% rise in daily trading volume, now at $3.46B. Analysts are watching closely as LINK approaches the significant $30 resistance. This price level has acted as a wall in the past, and breaking it could trigger a larger rally. Technical indicators remain favorable, LINK is trending in a steady channel, and the RSI around 61 still allows room for upside without signaling overbought levels. If the coin clears $30 convincingly, projections stretch up to $40 and beyond. Until then, key supports lie at $25 and $23 in case the current pace slows. While LINK’s setup is strong, all eyes are now on how it behaves at the $30 threshold, a level that could mark a shift from rally to full-on breakout. How BlockDAG Delivers Utility Before Launch While Ripple and Chainlink focus on technical movements, BlockDAG is making noise for all the right reasons. With $388 million raised, a Batch 30 price of $0.03, and a $0.05 confirmed launch, BlockDAG isn’t just building hype; it’s proving its groundwork is already in place. The recent live demo of its X1 mobile miner and X10 hardware unit grabbed attention across the crypto space. The X1 app, now used by over 3 million miners globally, allows users to earn through Proof‑of‑Engagement. The X10 miner, designed for home use, delivers up to 200 BDAG per day with plug‑and‑play simplicity. Together, they highlight a mining ecosystem that’s live, functional, and accessible, setting BlockDAG apart from presales stuck in the blueprint phase. Adding even more energy is Buyer Battles, a daily competition where the highest buyer wins free unsold coins, no strings attached. It’s a bold way to keep participation flowing and reward the most active supporters in real time. And with 20 exchange listings already confirmed, including MEXC, BitMart, XT.com, Coinstore, and LBank, BlockDAG is removing the usual post‑launch liquidity concerns that sink so many new projects. From real products to real listings, BlockDAG is delivering on every front, cementing itself as one of the most prepared and promising names to watch right now. Looking Ahead XRP has held its ground above $2.80, and LINK is gearing up for a big test at $30. Both setups bring near‑term excitement, especially for those focused on chart levels. But their momentum still depends on breaking resistance or keeping support intact. BlockDAG, on the other hand, has moved well beyond the “wait and see” stage. With $388M raised, a Batch 30 price of $0.03, and a launch confirmed at $0.05, it’s already built a strong financial base. But what sets it apart is the visible progress: working products, 20 confirmed listings, and the X1/X10 miner demo now out in the open. In a space where flashy predictions often replace actual delivery, BlockDAG has flipped the script. While XRP and LINK aim to hit targets, BlockDAG is already rolling, with structure, results, and attention all locked in.

Much of its success is attributed to its legal victory, which has been defined as a win for the entire crypto market. XRP bulls who are on the lookout for the next breakout coin are now eyeing Avalon X (AVLX) as its presale gains huge traction. Earlier this month, the SEC officially ended its case against Ripple. Five years ago, the U.S regulatory agency alleged that the fintech company sold unregistered securities in the form of XRP tokens. Over the years, the agency has attempted with no success to prove this claim. The crypto community had viewed the case as an attempt to hold back the market from disrupting the traditional finance sector. XRP, in particular, has been spearheading the revolution of the finance sector by offering fast, secure cross-border payments. This directly challenges banks and other financial institutions that have failed to modernize their systems. Ripple has spearheaded this mission, enjoying massive success in retail adoption and institutional integration. Avalon X And XRP Disrupt Traditional Markets Avalon X shares a similar vision to XRP with the intent to disrupt the real estate sector. This $379 trillion market has remained largely unchanged for decades. During this time, it has shut out individuals looking to invest in the lucrative sector. The Avalon X platform allows individuals to invest in the real estate market through the AVLX utility token. Since the official conclusion of the XRP case, Ripple has accelerated its efforts to increase adoption through strategic partnerships. Recently, the company, in collaboration with Gemini, has announced a new XRP card for investors. The card enables holders to spend their XRP tokens in various stores and rewards them with up to 4% in XRP cashbacks. https://x.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1960076737402048752 The token has also gained massive attention due to the application of numerous XRP ETFs by leading financial institutions. On October 24th, the SEC is set to review WisdomTree’s application. Analysts are optimistic of an approval, which could open the floodgates for billions of dollars to flow into XRP. This could be the trigger for a rally to an all-time high of $5. By holding XRP, holders are part of the financial revolution that will ultimately topple the banking sector. The same is true of AVLX; holders will be part of the tokenization of the real estate sector. Few individuals are invested in banks but are now part of the finance sector through XRP, and now the elusive real sector will be accessible to any individual through the Avalon X platform. XRP bulls have demonstrated to be some of the most strategic investors in the crypto market. They have shown to have uncanny timing and undeniable commitment to the project. Hence, their interest in the Avalon X platform is a vote of confidence for all potential investors. As XRP investors eye the $5 price target, AVLX has emerged as a great hedge for the asset or a strategic asset to diversify their portfolio. Avalon X (AVLX) $1 Million Giveaway At the heart of the Avalon X project is its real-world assets (RWAs), which are already successful in the Dominican Republic. Avalon X has partnered with Grupo Avalon, a leading developer with a nearly $1 billion project pipeline under its belt. In the future, the project plans to expand internationally, seizing the new era of tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). According to the Boston Consulting Group research, tokenization will unlock $19 trillion by 2033. With blockchain technology at the centre of this revolution, this offers a massive opportunity for smart investors. Avalon X is a direct link to unlock this market and make life-changing gains. In addition to being a bridge between blockchain and real estate, holders of the token will earn passive income through staking. This both generates income for holders and ensures price stability over the long term. AVLX tokens are priced at $0.005 in Stage 1 of the presale. To celebrate the launch of the project and reward early adopters, Avalon X has launched a $1 million giveaway . This will be shared by 10 lucky AVLX investors who get involved in the presale in this foundational stage. But that’s not all, one lucky investor will hit the jackpot by winning a dream townhouse in the Avalon Eco Valley department. Eco Valley Townhouse Giveaway These rewards demonstrate the project’s commitment to reward early adopters. But this shadows the potential early adopters stand to gain by accessing the $379 trillion real estate sector. Investors stand to make 100x returns in the near future, as well as carve out an incredible future in the tokenization of RWAs.

According to reports, a 38-page prospectus for a post-war Gaza, called the Gaza Reconstitution, Economic Acceleration and Transformation Trust (GREAT Trust), will see the US take over the Palestinian territory using tokenized land and digital tokens to relocate and rehouse residents. The takeover is planned to be under a trusteeship for at least 10 years. It will move two million Gazans in a “voluntary” scheme and give them a specialized token for their land. They may then use the token to get an apartment in one of the eight proposed “smart cities” or move somewhere else. The plan would also pay for their temporary lodging and food for up to four years. The plan says that putting in $100 billion could return almost four times that amount in ten years. Some of the proposed projects are desalination facilities in Egypt’s Sinai, a “Abrahamic Corridor” railway and energy network, data centers called “American Data Safe Haven,” and logistical hubs that connect Gaza to Israel, Egypt, and the Gulf. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan, the proposed land plan started with a group of Israeli businessmen, who presented the “Great Trust” idea to the Trump administration. Sources said that the “Great Trust” deck was compiled in April, ahead of the Israeli and US attacks on Iran. The blockchain technology comes into play The blockchain-infused plan comes as US President Donald Trump and his family deepen ties to the crypto industry. The prospectus suggests using a land trust and “developing a blockchain registry for land and tokenization to enhance liquidity” as an “innovative funding model.” It would use a blockchain as a “record of ownership” to tokenize Gaza, breaking the land into tokens so that people can claim “fractional ownership.” Investors would buy the tokens, which could be used to pay for reconstruction and humanitarian efforts. Holders can then buy and sell the tokens on secondary markets, where all token transactions are recorded in a blockchain register. Landowners in Gaza would get a token for giving up their land, which they could then trade for cash or an apartment in the strip. Every Palestinian who leaves the area would get $5,000, four years of rent help, and food for a year. The plan says that the money made from the scheme “could be reinvested in a new dedicated Palestinian Wealth Fund for the benefit of future Gazans.” However, it also says that the plan would be more profitable if it could get more Gazans to leave the territory, since relocating them costs $23,000 less. Several governments have also considered using blockchain technology because of its transparency. As reported by Cryptopolitan, Philippine Senator Bam Aquino announced his intention to propose a bill that would save the country’s national budget on blockchain. Palestinians say no, thank you Although the White House hasn’t accepted the plan yet, several parts of it are similar to Donald Trump’s repeated vow that the US will “take Gaza” and transform it into the “Riviera of the Middle East.” However, people in Gaza who still live in the ruins are against the idea of leaving their homes. Abu Mohammed, 55, from Khan Younis, whose home was half-destroyed in the battle, said, “I refuse to be expelled from my homeland.” According to reports, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, special envoy Steve Witkoff, and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair were all involved in meetings on the idea. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, has termed the plan “bold” and that it includes demilitarization and the return of hostages. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

On Monday, the Jakarta Composite Index dropped as much as 3.6%, while the rupiah sank to 16,500 per U.S. dollar , its weakest point since August 1, according to data from LSEG. The protests were triggered by frustration over soaring living costs, legislators’ fat paychecks, and recent reports of police violence, creating one of the worst crises the country has faced since President Prabowo Subianto took office last year. So far, at least eight people are dead, and the streets of Jakarta and other major cities are packed with protesters demanding action. Prabowo told the press on Sunday that the parliament would take public anger seriously, and said lawmakers would be forced to cut back on their huge allowances. He also warned that “firm action will be taken” against demonstrators causing damage, saying that some groups are “leading to treason and terrorism.” Prabowo has ordered the military and police to respond aggressively to looting and violence. Central bank prepares to intervene Airlangga Hartarto, the country’s chief economic minister, told reporters at a joint event with the Indonesia Stock Exchange and the financial services regulator that the economy “is fundamentally solid” and would receive a lift from a new incentive package being worked on. “We hope for a peaceful and respectful situation that will support economic recovery,” Airlangga said, attempting to calm market nerves. But investors weren’t convinced. The rupiah and the stock market both took sharp hits following news of the Friday protests. Early Monday, Erwin Gunawan Hutapea, who leads monetary management at Bank Indonesia, said the central bank will step in if needed, using market intervention to keep the rupiah in line with its real value. Erwin said this was to ensure the currency’s movements reflect “fundamentals,” suggesting they’re closely watching foreign exchange flows. Bond markets also reacted. Yields on Indonesia’s 10-year government debt rose to 6.335%, while 30-year bond yields held near 6.850%. Investors demanded higher returns to hold Indonesian paper amid the political chaos. Investors watch for long-term response Despite the market chaos, Radhika Rao, an economist at DBS, said the country’s long-term growth story remains intact. She said investors will focus on whether the government can shift budget cuts toward job creation. Radhika also said Bank Indonesia still has room to keep interest rates low and is expected to act quickly to stabilize the situation and support the rupiah. Meanwhile, BlackRock , the world’s biggest asset manager, hasn’t pulled out. Navin Saigal, the firm’s head of fundamental fixed income for Asia Pacific, said BlackRock has increased its holdings of long-dated Indonesian government bonds, preferring notes that mature in 10 to 15 years. Navin explained the firm switched out of shorter-term bonds because the longer ones didn’t react as sharply to Bank Indonesia’s recent surprise rate cut and the Federal Reserve’s dovish tone last month. “The recent headlines, in and of themselves, have not caused us to change any positions in Indonesia,” he said. “While I certainly think the situation warrants monitoring, it reinforces the notions that having sufficient risk premium, or margin of safety, in an investment is of utmost importance, and that a diversified approach is critical.” Indonesia , with a population of 284 million, is still the fourth-largest economy by population globally. But these protests are shaking that image. The country had long been seen as a dependable emerging market. Now, with blood on the streets and political promises flying around, the focus is shifting to how fast the government can regain control and whether foreign capital will stick around long enough to believe in the recovery. All eyes are on how Prabowo and his team respond next. The protests aren’t going away, and neither is the pressure on the currency. With investors growing cautious and the public demanding answers, Indonesia is running out of room to stall.

Large holders are increasingly selling off their whale-sized XRP positions, leading to significant liquidations and exacerbating the downward momentum. Weakening retail activity and on-chain participation suggest declining engagement with the token. At press time, XRP is trading around $2.80, down approximately $0.04 (-1.4%) from the previous trading day, with an intraday high near $2.84 and a low near $2.71. XRP’s current slump is attributed to seasonal weakness and macroeconomic pressures. Broader geopolitical and economic uncertainty has also exacerbated the risk-off environment, prompting cautious investors to reduce their holdings in speculative assets like XRP. At the same time, GoldenMining launched a mining contract based on XRP’s extremely fast transaction speed, extremely low handling fees, strong scalability, low energy consumption and other key features to help XRP traders hedge their risks daily and generate $6,700 in daily income.

51016076,570558,1756729470,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51016076.jpeg,Best Altcoins to Buy After Sudden Whale Shift from Bitcoin to Ethereum,https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-after-whales-shift-from-bitcoin-to-ethereum/,"Bitcoin has long been the darling of big-money crypto investors. But it looks like the winds are now shifting in favor of Ethereum. For instance, a $BTC whale ‘Bitcoin OG’ has been rotating funds from Bitcoin into Ethereum over the past month. Just this past weekend, the whale sold 4,000 $BTC and bought 96,859 $ETH within a 12-hour window. Today, he deposited a total of 3,000 $BTC into HyperLiquid to buy $ETH spot. Put together, this whale alone has purchased 886,371 $ETH valued at $4.07B since August 20 . Similarly, on August 21, another whale sold 670 $BTC from a massive seven-year-old stash of 14,837 $BTC (worth $1.6B) to build long $ETH positions, buying 68,130 tokens. This kind of large-scale institutional rotation underscores the growing confidence in Ethereum – the backbone of DeFi and Web3 – and highlights investors’ eagerness to diversify. Even better? Traditionally, a rise in $ETH allocations is followed by increased investment in altcoins, which is why many experts believe a new altcoin season could be just around the corner. Read on as we explore Ethereum’s path ahead and highlight the best altcoins to buy to make the most of this opportunity. Drying ETH Reserves and the WLFI Listing Effect Ethereum exchange reserves are dwindling rapidly. Data from CryptoQuant shows that $ETH available on exchanges is now at an all-time low , suggesting aggressive accumulation on all fronts. Another macro factor driving $ETH is the latest $WLFI (World Liberty Financial) token listing. WLFI is a Trump-backed crypto investment firm, and a massive 66% ($328.20M) of its total holdings are in Ethereum . So, a strong listing for WLFI could trigger further bullish momentum in $ETH. And things are looking pretty good on the technical side, too. $ETH is currently trading around $4,300 and is just one big fat green candle away from breaking out of a long-drawn consolidation zone, as highlighted by the descending triangle pattern in the image below. With all the stars aligning perfectly for Ethereum, the broader altcoin market stands to benefit the most. Since $ETH is the base layer for a majority of altcoins, stabilization at higher levels could lead to institutional liquidity rotating into smaller tokens as investors adopt a more risk-on approach and chase high-growth opportunities. Looking for the best cryptos to invest in right now? Here are three awesome suggestions. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Supercharging the Bitcoin Ecosystem with Solana-Like Performance Despite some big-money players preferring Ethereum over Bitcoin, there’s no shortage of bullish sentiment for the ‘digital gold.’ Just a couple of days ago, a new Bitcoin whale was born after a hefty 1,506 $BTC deposit worth $163.5M . That’s why Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) stands out as one of the best cryptos to buy now . It’s building the first-ever Layer 2 solution that’s aimed at bringing Solana-like performance to the otherwise slow and aging Bitcoin blockchain. By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), $HYPER will unlock full compatibility with smart contracts and dApps directly on Bitcoin. And thanks to a fast, decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge, you’ll be able to seamlessly convert your Layer 1 $BTC into ‘wrapped’ $BTC tokens, fully compatible with Hyper’s Layer 2. Why is this conversion important? Because it allows you to use native $BTC tokens across high-speed DeFi trading apps, NFT marketplaces, lending and staking protocols, DAOs, and gaming dApps. Currently in presale, Bitcoin Hyper has already raised over $13.2M from early investors. Here’s how to buy $HYPER . Each token is priced at just $0.012835, with our $HYPER price prediction suggesting the token could climb 2,400% by year-end – potentially hitting $0.32. Visit Bitcoin Hyper’s official website for more information. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – New Non-Custodial Crypto Wallet Enabling Direct Presale Purchase With trading volumes at record highs, the need for a reliable and easy-to-use crypto wallet has never been greater. Enter Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . This new crypto powers Best Wallet , a free crypto wallet that delivers a never-before-seen blend of usability and rock-solid security. It’s fully non-custodial, giving you exclusive control over your private keys. It offers advanced two-factor authentication options, including biometric login. It’s also packed with safeguards against hacks, scams, and phishing websites. Impressive, right? But the real kicker is its Presale Aggregator, which is a feature you won’t find in any other wallet. Simply put, it lets you buy the best crypto presales directly within the app. No need to jump across external websites, as everything happens securely inside Best Wallet. And buying $BEST doesn’t just give you front-row seats to the wallet’s growth, but it also unlocks a bunch of exclusive perks. These include reduced trading fees, voting rights, staking rewards (currently 87%), and early-bird access to new meme coins in presale . 1 $BEST is currently available at just $0.025575, with the project having already gathered over $15.3M. Check out $BEST’s official website for more information. 3. Unstable Coin ($USDUC) – Viral Meme Coin Pumping Harder than Ever The best thing about meme coins? They’re probably some of the most self-aware projects you’ll ever see – across industries, countries, and even planets. Unstable Coin ($USDUC) is a picture-perfect example. The token knows it’s a pure meme coin, and it doesn’t try to be anything else. In fact, it prides itself on having no intrinsic value, utility, or roadmap. On paper, it’s a satirical take on the USDC stablecoin and the entire ethos of stablecoins: bringing stability to the crypto market. But according to the developers of Unstable Coin, crypto is inherently volatile, and that shouldn’t change. The result? $USDUC, a meme coin that exists to revolt against stablecoins. And as we’ve come to expect from meme coin degens, the more absurd a coin’s premise, the more ridiculous its gains. Available on both Solana and Ethereum, $USDUC has already surged more than 518% since launching in June this year. It’s currently trading at record highs of $0.06947, and with momentum on its side, there may be no stopping it from rocketing further into uncharted territory. Bottom Line With institutional players snagging up Ethereum at an unprecedented pace, the stage is set for a full-blown altcoin season. Among the thousands of low-cap tokens on the market, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , and Unstable Coin ($USDUC) look primed to benefit the most from the broader market momentum. However, kindly keep in mind that none of the above is financial advice. Crypto investments are highly risky, and you must only invest after doing your own research.

A significant announcement from Upbit, a leading South Korean crypto exchange, is here. The platform has declared an urgent Upbit deposit suspension for several digital assets. This temporary halt will affect Qtum (QTUM), Ravencoin (RVN), and QiSwap (QI), starting promptly at 2:00 p.m. UTC on September 4. Understanding this update is crucial for anyone holding or planning to transact with these specific cryptocurrencies. What’s Behind This Urgent Upbit Deposit Suspension? Upbit has clearly stated that the reason for this Upbit deposit suspension is essential wallet system maintenance. Such maintenance is a common and critical practice in the cryptocurrency world. It ensures the ongoing security and operational efficiency of the exchange’s infrastructure. Think of it as a necessary tune-up to keep everything running smoothly and, most importantly, to protect your digital assets. This means that from the specified time, users will not be able to move these particular cryptocurrencies onto or off the Upbit platform. It’s a proactive measure designed to prevent any potential issues during the upgrade process. Which Cryptocurrencies Are Affected by This Suspension? It is important to know precisely which digital assets are impacted by this Upbit deposit suspension . The affected cryptocurrencies include: Qtum (QTUM): This is a decentralized blockchain application platform, known for combining the security of Bitcoin’s UTXO model with the smart contract capabilities of Ethereum. Ravencoin (RVN): A peer-to-peer network, Ravencoin is specifically designed for the efficient and secure transfer of assets from one party to another. QiSwap (QI): Operating as a decentralized exchange, QiSwap is built directly on the Qtum blockchain, facilitating token swaps within that ecosystem. If you hold any of these digital assets on Upbit, or if you had plans to deposit or withdraw them soon, this temporary halt directly impacts your immediate transaction capabilities. Always verify the exact start time in your local timezone. What Should Upbit Users Do During This Period? During the Upbit deposit suspension , it is vital for users to take specific actions to avoid complications. Here are some actionable insights: Plan Ahead: If you anticipate needing to deposit or withdraw QTUM, RVN, or QI, ensure you complete these transactions well before the 2:00 p.m. UTC, September 4 deadline. Stay Informed: Regularly check Upbit’s official announcement channels, such as their website or social media, for updates. Exchanges typically provide clear communication once maintenance is complete and services resume. Avoid Transactions: Do not attempt to initiate deposits or withdrawals for these specific coins during the suspension period. Such attempts will likely fail and could lead to unnecessary complications or delays in resolving your funds. Being prepared and following these guidelines will help you navigate this period smoothly. Why is Wallet Maintenance Crucial for Crypto Exchanges? Wallet system maintenance, which often leads to an Upbit deposit suspension , is a standard and necessary practice across the entire crypto industry. These planned downtimes serve several critical purposes: Enhance Security: Maintenance allows exchanges to patch any newly discovered vulnerabilities, upgrade security protocols, and fortify their defenses against potential cyber threats. Improve Performance: It provides an opportunity to optimize transaction speeds, improve system stability, and ensure the platform can handle increasing user demand without bottlenecks. Integrate Updates: Exchanges can implement new features, integrate blockchain upgrades, or adapt to changes in the underlying protocols of the cryptocurrencies they support. While an inconvenience for users, these measures are ultimately for the benefit of the entire community, safeguarding investments and ensuring a reliable, secure trading environment. The temporary Upbit deposit suspension for QTUM, RVN, and QI is a reminder of the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency exchanges. By staying informed, planning accordingly, and adhering to official guidance, users can navigate these essential maintenance periods effectively. Always prioritize official announcements from Upbit to get the most accurate information regarding the resumption of services. Your proactive approach ensures a smoother experience in the ever-evolving world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When does the Upbit deposit suspension officially begin? The suspension for QTUM, RVN, and QI deposits and withdrawals will begin at 2:00 p.m. UTC on September 4. Q2: Which specific cryptocurrencies are affected by this suspension? The affected cryptocurrencies are Qtum (QTUM), Ravencoin (RVN), and QiSwap (QI). Q3: Can I still trade QTUM, RVN, or QI on Upbit during the suspension?

Trading activities for these assets on the platform are typically unaffected unless explicitly stated otherwise by Upbit. However, liquidity might be impacted. Q4: What should I do if I need to move these coins urgently? If you need to deposit or withdraw QTUM, RVN, or QI, you must complete these transactions before the 2:00 p.m. UTC deadline on September 4. After this time, these services will be temporarily unavailable. Q5: How long is the Upbit deposit suspension expected to last?

August inflows hit $3.87B, making it the second-best month ever for ETH ETFs. Bitcoin ETFs lag behind: why Ethereum is stealing the spotlight. Ethereum ETFs Surge: Weekly and Monthly Inflows Between August 25 and August 29, 2025, cumulative inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs reached $1.08 billion, marking the fourth-largest weekly total since the products were launched, according to SoSoValue data. The Ethereum ETF sector experienced positive inflows on four out of five trading days. The largest inflow occurred on August 25, totaling $443 million, while the only outflow happened on the last trading day, about $165 million. Bitcoin ETFs: Slower Growth By comparison, Bitcoin ETFs attracted less than half as much capital over the week, totaling $440.7 million. The biggest inflow also came on August 25, with $219 million, but the week ended with a $127 million outflow.

Explore token presales, presale crypto tokens, and why both projects stand out in the best crypto presale landscape. The crypto world in 2025 is full of innovation, with token presales taking the spotlight as investors explore new opportunities. Among the best crypto presales to buy right now , projects like BlockDAG and BlockSack have sparked widespread discussion. BlockDAG has already made headlines for its large-scale fundraising, while BlockSack enters as a meme-driven presale cryptocurrency with its own unique narrative and community appeal. Both represent different ends of the crypto presale spectrum, showing how diverse the space has become. This comparison explores how each project defines its value in today’s growing list of top crypto presales. BlockSack: Meme Energy Meets Early Presale Opportunity Welcome to the Daddy of All Memes! $BSACK positions itself as a unique entry in the world of presale crypto, drawing attention with a story rooted in blockchain origins. Its design reflects the myth of Sacktoshi, who embodies the raw spark behind decentralized innovation. Unlike other diluted chains, BlockSack claims to represent the original essence, combining humor, culture, and digital creativity in one presale coin. The project builds its foundation around meme-driven energy but extends beyond entertainment. With a starting price of $0.00697 in Stage 1 of its presale cryptocurrency phase, it allows early supporters to engage with a low entry point. The next price jump to $0.00869 highlights how its presale crypto tokens are structured for progressive growth across blocks. Currently, BlockSack has raised over $13,493.30 out of its $126,347.97 target, marking 10.68% completion in its token presale. Each transaction and smart contract is presented as part of a larger narrative, turning its community into co-authors of the meme’s legacy. In a world of crypto presale projects, BlockSack stands out not only as a new token presale but also as an experiment in blending culture and blockchain identity. BlockDAG: Massive Fundraising and Market Recognition Among today’s top presale crypto projects , BlockDAG (BDAG) has earned its place with record-breaking fundraising. The project has already raised over $386 million, with more than 25.5 billion tokens sold during its crypto ICO presale. With Batch 30 tokens priced at $0.03, BlockDAG moves closer to its ambitious $600 million target. Its strong performance puts it on many crypto presale lists, showing how large-scale participation can validate a project’s early momentum. For those tracking the best crypto presale opportunities in 2025, BlockDAG demonstrates how structured token presales can achieve both scale and recognition in the competitive landscape of cryptocurrency presales. BlockSack Utility: Staking, Gaming, NFTs, and DeFi BlockSack’s presale crypto tokens are not just about meme culture — they bring functional use cases to Web3. Its staking protocol introduces a way for participants to earn passive income, creating utility beyond the presale coin stage. The token also doubles as a gaming currency within its play-to-earn ecosystem, allowing holders to buy presale crypto with future access to interactive entertainment. Through its NFT marketplace, BlockSack provides opportunities to trade unique digital assets and collectibles, extending its token presale into broader creative ownership. Additionally, its DeFi access allows participants to explore advanced decentralized finance protocols, placing BSACK among crypto presale projects that combine humor with practical applications. These features make it part of the top crypto presales to watch in 2025. BlockSack vs BlockDAG: Presale Crypto in 2025 The 2025 presale crypto landscape is defined by both scale and creativity, with BlockDAG and BlockSack standing as distinct examples. BlockDAG reflects the power of large fundraising, joining the ranks of top presale crypto projects through its multi-million-dollar performance. BlockSack, on the other hand, approaches token presales from a cultural angle, mixing meme-driven storytelling with staking, NFTs, gaming, and DeFi access. While one highlights structure and scale, the other emphasizes identity and community engagement in presale cryptocurrency innovation. Together, they illustrate how cryptocurrency presales can cater to very different audiences. For those exploring the best crypto presale to buy right now, the contrast between BlockDAG’s structured growth and BlockSack’s meme-driven energy showcases the variety of opportunities in 2025’s token presales.

Litecoin features quicker block times and lower transaction fees, maintaining its high trading volume and use. The appeal of mining these cryptocurrencies lies in their lower competition and accessibility compared to mining behemoths like Bitcoin.

Ethena (ENA) and Immutable (IMX) lead the cliff unlock category while Solana dominates linear releases. The unlocks include both large cliff events exceeding $5 million and daily linear releases above $1 million across multiple projects. Ethena leads large cliff unlocks The cliff unlock schedule is led by ENA with 212.50 million tokens, equivalent to $135.51 million. It contributes to 3.35% of the cumulative unlock supply of ENA. It is the highest unlock value on the weekly release scale. Image by Cryptopolitan: Source – Tokenomist Immutable comes next with 24.52 million IMX tokens unlocking worth $12.32 million. This unlock accounts for 1.27% of the unlock supply allocation of IMX. ELX has the larger cliff unlock with 55 million tokens, equivalent to $6.83 million. The unlock has greater impact too when considering supply, accounting for 30.54% of ELX’s unlock allocation. This is a big percentage and can lead to selling pressure of the token. These cliff unlocks differ from linear releases by dumping large token quantities at once. Market participants often prepare for increased volatility around these events. The concentrated nature of cliff unlocks can lead to immediate price impacts. Solana leads large linear unlocks Solana dominates the linear unlock category with 506.47K SOL tokens worth $99.96 million. It accounts for only 0.09% of SOL’s circulating supply on a daily basis. This negligible percentage serves to dampen the selling pressure around cliff events. The TRUMP token follows up with 4.89 million tokens worth $41.18 million in linear releases. This unlock is equivalent to 1.52% of the daily circulating supply of TRUMP. This larger percentage may generate larger market impact. Worldcoin supplies 37.23 million WLD tokens worth $32.36 million linearly. The unlock is equivalent to 0.97% of WLD circulating supply daily. It results in a steady supply growth that is predictable for market makers. Weekly linear releases are topped by TAO contributing $10.65 million, DOGE contributing $19.79 million, and TIA contributing $12.66 million. AVAX and SUI contribute $16.23 million and $9.58 million, respectively. MORPHO, ETHFI, DOT, IP, and JTO form the top linear releases. Linear unlocks spread token distribution over time rather than single events. This method reduces market shock and also maintains steady supply growth. Projects often prefer linear schedules for long-term price stability and community building through predictable token flows. Less popular token unlocks As per CoinMarketCap data , Adventure Gold faces upcoming unlocks with 83.51 million AGLD in circulation and 90.22% unlock progress completed. The next unlock involves 1.55 million AGLD tokens worth approximately $1.06 million. Echo Protocol has 208.15 million ECHO tokens circulating and is up to 62.18% in its unlock ratio. The next unlock is 16.23 million ECHO tokens, worth up to $485,918. ECHO has a market capitalization of $6.23 million. ReadFi currently has 42 million tokens of SRDF and 73% of unlock completion. It has 1.59 million SRDF tokens available for its next unlock. Orbler currently has 1.01 billion tokens of ORBR and 89.15% unlocked. Its next unlock has 31.01 million tokens of ORBR and is equal to roughly $2.82 million. Quack AI is showing a rare instance with 1.61 billion Q tokens in circulation but 0% unlock progress. That next unlock may unleash 1.62 billion Q tokens within a huge supply explosion. The token itself has zero trading value on monitoring platforms. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Theo các nhà phân tích, mô hình “falling wedge” đã bị phá vỡ, mở ra cơ hội hồi phục. Tuy nhiên, dù bật tăng, dư địa đi xa của XRP vẫn khá hạn chế nếu so với các altcoin presale mới. Dữ liệu thị trường cho thấy XRP dao động quanh vùng $2,92 – $3,05, với kháng cự gần $3,10 và hỗ trợ ở mức $2,90. Nếu lực mua duy trì, giá có thể tiến đến $3,30. Song, so với đỉnh đầu năm, XRP đã giảm sâu, khiến khả năng bứt phá mạnh trở nên khó khăn. Token6900 ở $0.005 – ứng viên altcoin tiềm năng 200x Trái ngược với XRP, Token6900 nổi lên như một trong những đồng coin tiềm năng nhất hiện nay. Dự án thu hút sự chú ý nhờ vào cộng đồng năng động và tokenomics minh bạch. Không chỉ là một meme coin , Token6900 còn hướng đến giá trị dài hạn thông qua việc gắn kết cộng đồng. Những điểm nổi bật của Token6900: Phân phối công bằng trong giai đoạn presale, giúp nhiều nhà đầu tư dễ dàng tiếp cận. Nguồn cung giới hạn, tạo áp lực khan hiếm và tiềm năng tăng giá cao. Sức hút cộng đồng mạnh mẽ, được thúc đẩy bởi viral marketing và yếu tố giải trí đặc trưng. Khác biệt lớn nhất là Token6900 không chỉ sống nhờ “trend” ngắn hạn, mà còn tập trung xây dựng hệ sinh thái cộng đồng bền vững, giúp giữ vững giá trị lâu dài. Presale và tokenomics minh bạch Hiện tại, Token6900 đang mở bán presale ở mức $0.005/token, được xem là mức giá hấp dẫn cho những nhà đầu tư sớm. Với tổng cung cố định và lộ trình tăng giá rõ ràng, dự án cân bằng được giữa tăng trưởng dài hạn và sự ổn định. Kết luận Ở mức $3, XRP mang lại sự an toàn và ổn định của một đồng coin lớn, nhưng dư địa tăng trưởng không còn nhiều.

51018797,570932,1756733918,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51018797.jpeg,Growing Digital Wallet Adoption Amongst Younger Generation Bodes Well For Best Wallet Token,https://bitcoinist.com/report-reveals-preference-for-digital-wallets-best-wallet-to-pump/,"Research shows that digital wallet adoption has soared since the start of 2023. PYMNTS Intelligence, a research firm specializing in financial trends, released a report on e-commerce adoption among different age groups. Based on responses from 2,722 consumers in the US, PYMNTS found that younger consumers are increasingly using digital wallets for their purchases despite general similarities in trends across retail and travel sectors. While younger millennials and Gen Z are the most likely to use digital wallets for making purchases, the report revealed that digital wallets account for 16% of online payments across various age groups. PYMNTS also found that the preference for digital wallets is even higher for cross-border transactions, as 42% of respondents in a separate survey said that digital wallet transactions are their “go-to” when sending money abroad. Those surveyed indicated multiple reasons for their preference compared to traditional methods, including: Higher trust levels in digital wallets Lower fees Quicker clearance times The digital wallet market will inevitably expand as support for cryptocurrency-based payments grows. However, there are several barriers to adoption, not least the technical expertise required to make transactions in current digital wallet solutions. That’s where Best Wallet ($BEST) aims to disrupt the market. Unlike traditional browser-based digital wallets, Best Wallet is betting that the future of digital payments is on mobile devices. Read on to discover why the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is set to surge due to growing interest in digital wallets. Best Wallet – A Cross-Chain Wallet Built for the Mobile-First Generation Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the native token of Best Wallet, an innovative crypto wallet solution designed to operate across multiple blockchains smoothly with a user-friendly mobile interface. Best Wallet lets you manage your entire crypto portfolio from a single app, rivaling outdated wallets like MetaMask by making cross-chain swaps between platforms like Ethereum and Solana easier and providing in-app access to the hottest presale tokens. The underlying security is powered by Fireblocks MPC-CMP wallet technology, allowing you to create secure cloud backups of all your multi-chain wallets. You can try it out for yourself, as Best Wallet is already available for download from both Google Play and the Apple App Store. The $BEST token powers the Best Wallet ecosystem. Crypto swap fees are reduced when you use $BEST to make transactions, which is perfect if you want to benefit from the in-app presale market. $BEST holders also get early access to trusted presales. If there are features or blockchains you’d like to see added to the Best Wallet app in the future, $BEST also lets you participate in a DAO and vote on key decisions for Best Wallet’s future roadmap. Best of all, $BEST provides some lucrative staking rewards. If you buy $BEST before launch, you can earn 87% annual returns on the tokens you stake. The presale is still active and has generated over $15.3M in token sales so far, with a release scheduled no later than December 31st, 2025. At the time of writing, 1 $BEST costs $0.025575. However, if the presale maintains the current momentum, we expect $BEST to sell out earlier in Q4 2025. Purchase $BEST today before the presale ends. The Future is Bright for Digital Wallets The PYMNTS report confirms something we’ve suspected for a while: younger people are adopting digital payments instead of traditional banking because it provides more convenience, lower fees, and fewer barriers to entry. That’s why we expect $BEST to benefit greatly from the broad install base for Best Wallet as we eagerly await the token launch. All crypto products are volatile. Always do your own research before investing and only invest what you’re prepared to lose. This article is not financial advice.

They’ve just unveiled a crucial Bitcoin market bottom projection, placing it squarely between $93,000 and $95,000. This comes after Bitcoin experienced a significant drop, falling over 13% from its recent peak, leaving many investors wondering where the next major support level might be. Understanding Bitfinex’s Crucial Forecast Bitfinex, a leading digital asset exchange, regularly publishes detailed reports that offer insights into market trends. Their latest Alpha weekly report highlights the recent downturn in Bitcoin’s price. After reaching a peak, the asset saw a notable correction. However, instead of just pointing out the fall, their analysts have put forth a specific range for a potential Bitcoin market bottom . The Projection: A bottom between $93,000 and $95,000. The Context: Bitcoin recently dropped more than 13% from its highest point. The Implication: This suggests a strong support zone where selling pressure might exhaust, potentially leading to a reversal or consolidation. This kind of projection is vital for traders and long-term investors alike. It provides a potential anchor point in an often-turbulent market, helping to shape strategies and manage expectations effectively. What Drives This Bitcoin Market Bottom Prediction? You might be asking, “How do they arrive at such precise figures?” While the report details aren’t fully provided here, such predictions typically stem from a combination of sophisticated analytical tools and keen market observations. Analysts at Bitfinex likely leverage a variety of metrics, including: On-chain Data: Examining transaction volumes, wallet activity, and exchange flows to understand real-time market behavior. Technical Analysis: Identifying key support and resistance levels, trend lines, and classic chart patterns that often precede price movements. Macroeconomic Factors: Assessing broader economic conditions, such as inflation rates and interest rate policies, that could influence investor sentiment and capital allocation towards risk assets. Derivatives Market Data: Looking at futures and options markets for clues on market sentiment and positioning, which can signal potential shifts. These elements combined help form a comprehensive picture, allowing experts to forecast potential turning points. Understanding the potential Bitcoin market bottom is not just about a number; it’s about the underlying forces shaping market dynamics. Navigating the Volatile Crypto Landscape: What Does This Mean for Investors? For many, a projection like this offers a glimmer of hope or a strategic entry point. However, it’s crucial to approach such forecasts with a balanced perspective. While Bitfinex’s analysis is well-regarded, the crypto market remains inherently unpredictable. Wise investors use such insights to inform, not dictate, their decisions. Key considerations for investors: Risk Management: Always prioritize protecting your capital. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the exact Bitcoin market bottom , consider investing a fixed amount regularly over time to average out your purchase price. Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Explore other assets to balance your portfolio and spread risk. Stay Informed: Continue to follow reputable analyses and market news to adapt your strategy as conditions evolve, ensuring you remain agile. Challenges and Considerations for the Bitcoin Market Despite expert projections, several factors can influence whether Bitcoin truly finds its bottom in the projected range. The broader economic environment, regulatory developments, and even unexpected global events can all play a significant role. For instance: Global Economic Uncertainty: High inflation, ongoing interest rate hikes, or escalating geopolitical tensions can lead investors to pull back from riskier assets like crypto, regardless of technical indicators. Regulatory Scrutiny: New regulations or enforcement actions in major markets could significantly impact investor confidence and market liquidity. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen events, by definition, cannot be predicted but can dramatically alter market trajectories, making even the most robust predictions challenging. Therefore, while the $93K-$95K range provides a compelling target for the Bitcoin market bottom , market participants should remain agile and prepared for various scenarios. The crypto space is known for its rapid shifts, and adaptability is key to long-term success. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin Bitfinex’s projection offers a fascinating insight into where Bitcoin might find substantial support after its recent correction. A potential Bitcoin market bottom between $93,000 and $95,000 could signal a significant turning point, potentially paving the way for future price stability or even a rebound. However, investors are reminded that market analysis is a guide, not a crystal ball. Understanding the rationale behind such forecasts, coupled with sound investment principles, will be essential for navigating the exciting, yet challenging, journey of Bitcoin in the months to come. Stay informed, stay strategic, and always prioritize prudent financial decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Bitfinex’s latest Bitcoin price prediction? A1: Bitfinex’s Alpha weekly report projects a potential Bitcoin market bottom to be between $93,000 and $95,000. Q2: Why is Bitfinex projecting a specific price range for Bitcoin? A2: This prediction comes after Bitcoin’s recent 13% fall from its peak, and it’s likely based on comprehensive analysis of on-chain data, technical indicators, and macroeconomic factors to identify strong support levels. Q3: Should I invest based solely on this Bitcoin market bottom prediction? A3: While expert predictions offer valuable insights, they should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. The crypto market is highly volatile. It’s crucial to conduct your own research, manage risk, and consider strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging. Q4: What factors could influence whether Bitcoin reaches this projected bottom? A4: Various factors, including global economic conditions, regulatory changes, and unforeseen “black swan” events, can significantly impact Bitcoin’s price trajectory and whether it finds its projected Bitcoin market bottom . Q5: What does “Bitcoin market bottom” mean for investors? A5: A projected Bitcoin market bottom suggests a price level where selling pressure might subside, potentially leading to a price stabilization or reversal. For investors, it can be seen as a potential entry point or a key reference for market sentiment. Did Bitfinex’s intriguing Bitcoin market bottom prediction catch your eye?

The market is full of new launches, but not all are built for long-term success. BlockDAG (BDAG) has pulled in attention during its presale, but recent BlockDAG price prediction reports raise concerns. Meanwhile, Pepeto (PEPETO) is separating itself from the noise with audited contracts, whale accumulation, and live utilities that most presales simply do not have. With more than $6.4 million raised, over 100,000 community members, and its presale price still just $0.000000150, Pepeto has become one of the strongest contenders in the market. Its mix of meme appeal and working infrastructure gives it a real edge in a sector often dominated by hype. But how does it compare with BlockDAG, which is also competing for investor attention? BlockDAG Price Prediction BlockDAG raised over $330 million in its presale, moving its token price from $0.001 to $0.0276. But most BlockDAG price prediction outlooks for 2025 are weak, with estimates placing it between $0.0015 and $0.002. Some even see a decline in 2026 if demand slows. The problem is clear: BlockDAG has no utility, no working products, and no roadmap beyond token sales. Without clear use cases or adoption drivers, its growth is capped, making it more of a short-term presale gamble than a sustainable project. Why Pepeto Is the Best Crypto Presale to Buy Right Now Pepeto takes a different approach. It launches with PepetoSwap, a zero-fee decentralized exchange, and PepetoBridge, a cross-chain liquidity tool. These utilities solve real issues for traders, making Pepeto stand out as more than hype and positioning it as one of the best crypto presales to buy in 2025. Staking adds further strength. Investors can lock tokens and earn live yields of 235% APY, a setup that encourages long-term holding and stability ahead of listings. Momentum is building fast. At $0.000000150, Pepeto’s presale has already raised more than $6.4 million. Each stage lifts the price, rewarding early buyers and creating urgency. Analysts compare it to Shiba Inu’s early days but with stronger fundamentals. A $10,000 entry today secures billions of tokens, with realistic seven-figure upside if Pepeto meets its targets. This makes it one of the best crypto to buy now for anyone chasing life-changing returns. Why Pepeto Is Built for the Future Pepeto combines meme culture with scalable infrastructure. PepetoSwap removes all trading fees, while PepetoBridge allows safe and simple cross-chain transfers. This setup answers trader pain points and ensures Pepeto has staying power beyond hype. Its tokenomics are structured for growth and fairness: 30% Presale for liquidity and distribution 30% Staking with live 235% APY rewards for holders 20% Marketing for global adoption 12.5% Liquidity to support trading stability 7.5% Development for continuous upgrades Pepeto avoids common risks with no team wallets and no trading tax, keeping incentives aligned with investors. Independent audits by Coinsult and SolidProof further strengthen credibility and security. Conclusion: Pepeto Outshines BlockDAG BlockDAG price predictions show limited upside and lack of utility. Pepeto, by contrast, has real products, audited contracts, whale backing, and one of the most attractive presales in the market. At just $0.000000150, with more than $6.4 million already raised, Pepeto is well-positioned to lead this cycle. Whales are accumulating, stages are selling out, and the price is rising. Pepeto is not just another presale hype project. It has the setup to define 2025’s bull run. The only question is how high it will climb once Tier 1 listings begin and wider adoption kicks in.

While the subsequent debate focuses on how much inflow the XRP ETF can attract, some analysts predict large inflows, while others predict weak inflows. The final comment at this point came from Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg, who also filed a spot XRP ETF application. In a recent interview with Paul Barron's, Steven McClurg stated that XRP ETFs could attract substantial inflows. The renowned CEO even argued that XRP could rival Ethereum's market capitalization. “XRP ETF could attract $5 billion in inflows in first month and surpass ETH.” The famous CEO noted that the SEC is very likely to approve XRP ETFs because XRP futures are already offered on Coinbase and CME. At this point, the famous CEO stated that XRP ETFs are one of the strongest candidates to receive approval and pointed to the end of the year at the latest. “If I had to guess, I'd predict XRP will get ETF approval this year, along with Litecoin, possibly HBAR, and Solana. I believe those will happen in 2025.” Canary Capital CEO McClurg recently added that XRP is the most well-known cryptocurrency after Bitcoin in Wall Street and financial circles. *This is not investment advice.

The renewed investor appetite comes despite continued turbulence in the broader crypto market, where both Bitcoin and Ether saw significant price drops. Bitcoin, which briefly crossed $113,000 earlier in the week, slipped below $108,000 as volatility weighed on the market. Ether mirrored this decline, tumbling under $4,300 after starting the week above $4,600, reflecting uncertainty despite strong institutional inflows. Spot Ether ETFs Lead Inflows While the total inflows highlighted a positive turnaround, they remained far from the $4.4 billion record set in July. A large share of last week’s gains came from spot Ether ETFs, which secured $1.4 billion in inflows and continued to dominate the market. Bitcoin funds attracted $748 million, signaling steady but more modest investor confidence in the world’s largest cryptocurrency. However, the streak of continuous inflows was broken by Friday, when both Bitcoin and Ether ETFs registered outflows . Data from SoSoValue showed this ended Ether’s six-day streak of inflows and Bitcoin’s four-day streak, suggesting that investor sentiment remains cautious amid broader macroeconomic concerns. Meanwhile, alternative assets like Solana and XRP enjoyed increasing momentum . Solana logged $177 million in inflows, while XRP attracted $134 million, boosted by growing speculation that U.S. regulators may soon approve ETFs tied to these assets. Adoption Outlook and Long-Term Growth Amid the market’s short-term swings, longer-term adoption trends remain strong. Former hedge fund manager and macro investor Raoul Pal projected that global crypto users could reach 4 billion by 2030. In an X post on Sunday, Pal compared the growth of crypto adoption with the internet’s trajectory , noting that the crypto user base has grown by 137% annually over the past nine years, reaching an estimated 659 million by the end of 2024. By comparison, the internet counted 187 million users at the end of 2000, growing at a 76% annual rate. Pal expects crypto adoption to moderate to a 43% growth rate next year, but still predicts that by 2030, one in eight people worldwide could be active crypto users.

After weeks of low fees, with gas under 1 gWei, the network jumped to a red-hot 100 gWei per transaction. The Ethereum network is seeing a day of overheated gas prices, recalling the peak days of 2021. After weeks of normal-level activity, with gas fees under 1 gWei as the network faced a new set of conditions. WLFI may have a more lasting effect on the Ethereum ecosystem, as Trump’s fund intends to roll out lending, voting, and other activities around the token. ETH gas prices immediately spiked after the launch of a transferable WLFI token, breaking above 100 gWei for the first time in months. | Source: Eth Gas Station Immediately after World Liberty Fi made its token transferable and started trading, the price of gas rose above 100 gWei. This meant that swaps cost over $145 at one point. The Ethereum network showed it was still at risk for high fees and congestion in the case of high-profile events and trader exuberance, though few other tokens or contracts have caused a similar gas spike during the most recent bull cycle. DeFi participants were affected, as Ethereum became more expensive for bridging and borrowing. Even regular operations were priced above $100, with token and ETH transfers at over $10. Following the gas spike, ETH also recovered to $4,403.56, retaining the expectations of increased usage. WLFI becomes the top smart contract On-chain data showed the WLFI token became the most active smart contract as the tokens were distributed and traded. In the hours after the launch, WLFI usage led to 129.22 ETH burned from fees. Ethereum base fees also spiked to an anomalous level, based on validator compensation data . The recent gas usage spike followed the real token transfers. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, WLFI also saw a spike in activity for derivative products, hours before its official launch . The effect of WLFI was also felt in the general count of Ethereum transactions. After a successful August, the token also boosted the number of daily transfers to over 1.58M transactions in 24 hours. Daily active addresses also increased above 550K . On-chain data shows one of the World Liberty Fi wallets is boosting WLFI trading by deploying the project’s native USD1 stablecoin . The token is still in price discovery, trading at around $0.31, with 10% in daily gains. On-chain transfer data shows World Liberty Fi is using Cow Protocol to perform swaps. The trading uses both USD1 and USDC in a series of high-speed trades. On-chain data shows a series of high-speed interactions with multiple stablecoins, DEX, and DeFi protocols, all linked to one of the known wallets of World Liberty Fi. World Liberty Fi announces post-launch tokenomics World Liberty Fi announced its post-launch plans, including a new distribution and free float. WLFI started trading and transfers with a supply of 24,669,070,265 tokens, as World Liberty Fi announced in a recent blog . The organization itself will hold 10B unlocked tokens. Alt5 Sigma Corporation will hold 7,783,585,650 tokens, or around 8% of the supply, based on its WLFI treasury strategy. Around 2.8B of the tokens will be used for liquidity and marketing purposes, while the public presale holders will receive around 4B unlocked tokens. All remaining WLFI will still be locked, based on a long-term vesting schedule. The WLFI launch event also invited scrutiny, as it turned out that the token launched with a relatively small free float. The highly active trading sparks fears of potential early profit-taking, as the token immediately broke to a new price range above its early buyer price. WLFI launched with around $7M in liquidity on its leading DEX pair, almost immediately dropping from $0.31 to $0.028. There is still no data of whale profits, and early snipers have mostly seen losses.

In an August 30 X post, the Ethereum co-founder, who is also the founder of OG blockchain software company Consensys, said that ETH will likely 100x from here and “ probably much more ,” with potential to flip Bitcoin’s monetary base. I am 100% aligned with almost all of what Tom @fundstrat says here. Yes, Wall Street will stake because they currently pay for their infrastructure and Ethereum will replace much of the many siloed stacks they operate on (e.g. JPMorgam probably operates on several siloed stacks… https://t.co/bW93kkX1gW — Joseph Lubin (@ethereumJoseph) August 30, 2025 Lubin boldly opined that Wall Street will stake Ether because they currently pay for their infrastructure, and Ethereum will “ replace much of the many siloed stacks they operate on .” Why Lubin Sees 100X ETH Rally Through Wall Street Adoption Lubin revealed that Ethereum will need to operate as a more or less traditional finance company that runs on decentralized rails. This means staking, running validators, operating L2s/L3s, participating in DeFi, and writing smart contract software for agreements and financial instruments. Lubin said he was also “100% aligned” with Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner Tom Lee, who said in August that Wall Street would stake and use Ethereum, and that ETH could flip Bitcoin in terms of network value. “This is like 1971 when the dollar left gold.” Tom Lee: “very high probability” $ETH flips $BTC . Ethereum is becoming Wall Street’s new tech stack. $BMNR $SBET $GLXY pic.twitter.com/ZC3jDByiWb — SamAlτcoin.eth (@SamAltcoin_eth) August 22, 2025 In his post responding to Lee’s bullish Ethereum projections, Lubin commented that he and Lee are friends who get on calls intermittently to discuss elements of Lee’s broader Ethereum strategy . Lubin doubled down on his 100x ETH rally stance in alignment with Lee, saying, “ I keep telling Tom this: he is not nearly bullish enough .” He explained why Ethereum is the best macro trade in the next decade, stating that nobody on the planet can currently fathom how large and fast a rigorously decentralized economy, operating on decentralized Ethereum Trustware, can grow. “ Trust is a new kind of virtual commodity. And ETH, the highest octane decentralized trust commodity, will eventually flip all the other commodities on the planet ,” Lubin added. Tom Lee Doubles Down that ‘ETH Will Rally to $12,000’ In an August 25 CNBC live appearance , Lubin’s friend Tom Lee shared a similar sentiment, agreeing that ETH will secure the next layer of the internet. According to Lee, Ethereum’s smart contracts will provide that layer. Aside from the long-term 100x ETH rally projection, Lee recently predicted that Ethereum will rally in the near term to $5,500, with an ambitious year-end target of $12,000. Ethereum remains the foundational blockchain infrastructure for traditional finance (TradFi), currently supporting over $160 billion in stablecoin supply. BREAKING: The stablecoin supply on @ethereum surpasses $160 billion, marking an all-time high. The supply has more than doubled from January '24 levels. pic.twitter.com/RS4Xh4XVGu — Token Terminal (@tokenterminal) August 30, 2025 This has put stablecoin supply on Ethereum at a new all-time high, with issuance more than doubling since January 2024, according to Token Terminal . The increase in stablecoin supply typically implies demand for the underlying token (ETH), which the market can price in as it enters a new trading week. Ether began the weekend by gaining 1.6% to approach the $4,500 level, but failed to break through resistance, instead returning to $4,400 during early trading on Monday morning. Source: TradingView Eneko Knorr, founder and CEO of Stabolut, shared with Cryptonews that, while Ethereum’s momentum remains strong, the market may pause before the next move. “ I wouldn’t be surprised to see it cool off a bit or trade sideways for a while to catch its breath. The real battleground for September is the $4,000 mark. “ According to Knorr, if ETH can break through and hold the $4,000 level, the path to its previous all-time high near $4,900 looks wide open. If it gets rejected there, he’s watching the $3,550–$3,600 area as the first line of defense. ETH Price Action: $4,867 Resistance Holds Key to 100X Rally On the technical front, the Ethereum 4H chart reveals a bullish structure forming after the price respected the trendline support and rebounded from the fair value gap zone around $4,300–$4,350. Clear resistance remains around $4,700 and a critical level at the all-time high of $4,867, which is marked as the main upside target. Source: TradingView/realtiger11 Currently, price is consolidating above the support box, and the upward projection indicates a strong probability of ETH making another attempt to reclaim the $4,700 region before extending toward the all-time high. If momentum holds, clearing $4,867 could pave the way for new highs beyond $5,000. However, a failure to sustain above the support zone could invalidate the bullish case and drag ETH back toward $4,100.

Record Q2 profits: $14B operating, $10B net income. S&P 500 inclusion could mark a Bitcoin market milestone. Strategy Nears Historic S&P 500 Inclusion as Bitcoin Soars Strategy, known for its Bitcoin accumulation approach, has officially met all criteria for potential inclusion in the S&P 500 index. According to CoinDesk , citing S&P Dow Jones Indices, the committee’s decision could arrive as early as September. Record-Breaking Q2 Performance In Q2 2025, Strategy reported one of its strongest results ever: $14 billion in operating profit $10 billion in net income, corresponding to $32.6 per share (diluted EPS) $114.5 million in revenue, up 2.7% year-over-year, with subscription revenue surging nearly 70% Management also raised its 2025 guidance: $34 billion in operating income, $24 billion in net income, and $80 per share EPS, assuming Bitcoin hits $150,000 by year-end. Bitcoin Holdings Drive Growth As of September 1, Strategy held 632,457 BTC on its balance sheet and posted a BTC yield of 25.4% year-to-date.

PEPENODE có thể vượt Pepe vào năm 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/next-100x-meme-coin-pepenode-vs-pepe-2025-vn/,"Không gian meme coin vẫn liên tục xuất hiện nhiều dự án mới, nhưng đa phần chỉ lặp lại mô hình quen thuộc: phát hành token, tạo sóng meme trên mạng xã hội và trông chờ hiệu ứng viral. PEPENODE đã phá vỡ khuôn mẫu này khi mang đến game đào ảo, cơ chế đốt token giảm phát và tiện ích presale tức thì, cho phép người dùng tham gia và trải nghiệm ngay từ ngày đầu tiên. Hiện tại, token $PEPENODE đang mở bán presale với mức giá chỉ $0.0010242/token. Trong khi hầu hết presale khác buộc nhà đầu tư phải mua token rồi chờ nhiều tháng để thấy giá trị thực tiễn, PEPENODE lại đi theo một hướng hoàn toàn khác. Người dùng có thể xây dựng mỏ đào ảo riêng ngay sau khi mua token, biến dự án này trở thành một trong những meme coin tiềm năng nhất trên thị trường hiện nay. Cơ hội Presale Meme Coin 100x tiềm năng năm 2025 Thị trường crypto đã nhiều lần chứng kiến những cú bùng nổ ngoạn mục từ các meme coin . DOGE từng đạt mức giá khó tin qua nhiều đợt bull run. PEPE cũng gây bất ngờ lớn với tốc độ tăng trưởng nhanh chóng, mang lại lợi nhuận khổng lồ cho những nhà đầu tư sớm. Chính vì thế, cộng đồng tiếp tục săn tìm cái tên tiếp theo có thể lặp lại kỳ tích này. PEPENODE xuất hiện trong bối cảnh cạnh tranh đó với nhiều điểm khác biệt so với meme coin truyền thống. Dự án không chỉ dừng ở yếu tố giải trí, mà còn mang đến ứng dụng thực tế thông qua hệ sinh thái khai thác ảo. Thay vì chỉ giữ token và chờ giá tăng, người dùng có thể trực tiếp tham gia vào game để nhận thưởng theo thời gian. Thời điểm ra mắt của PEPENODE cũng được đánh giá là rất phù hợp. Sau khi Ethereum loại bỏ cơ chế đào tiêu tốn năng lượng, phí giao dịch giảm mạnh và mạng lưới trở nên hiệu quả hơn. Điều này mở ra cơ hội cho các ứng dụng tương tác như PEPENODE phát triển mạnh mẽ. Nhà đầu tư tham gia presale sớm còn có lợi thế sở hữu node khai thác chất lượng hơn, từ đó nhận được phần thưởng cao hơn. PEPENODE So Sánh Với Pepe và Các Meme Coin Khác Các meme coin truyền thống như Pepe thường phụ thuộc nặng nề vào tâm lý cộng đồng và giao dịch mang tính đầu cơ. Pepe đã thành công nhờ văn hóa meme lan truyền mạnh cùng chiến lược niêm yết trên nhiều sàn giao dịch lớn. Tuy nhiên, ngoài việc nắm giữ và giao dịch, tính ứng dụng thực tế của Pepe khá hạn chế. Ngược lại, PEPENODE mang đến một lớp trải nghiệm tương tác mới, giúp giữ chân người dùng lâu dài kể cả sau lần mua ban đầu. Các node khai thác ảo hoạt động như tài sản kỹ thuật số, có thể triển khai và nâng cấp trong các “phòng máy chủ” tùy chỉnh. Mỗi node đóng góp hashpower cho quá trình khai thác, quyết định số lượng token mà người dùng nhận được khi tham gia liên tục. Đặc biệt, cơ chế giảm phát (deflationary) của PEPENODE tạo ra sự cân bằng giữa tính ứng dụng và nguồn cung khan hiếm. Khi người dùng chi tiêu token $PEPENODE để nâng cấp node, 70% lượng token này sẽ bị đốt vĩnh viễn, khiến nguồn cung lưu hành giảm dần khi ngày càng nhiều người tham gia hệ sinh thái. Bỏ Qua Chi Phí Thiết Bị Đắt Đỏ Khai thác crypto theo cách truyền thống luôn đi kèm vô số rắc rối: cần dàn máy tính đắt đỏ, hóa đơn điện tăng cao và quá trình cài đặt phức tạp khiến nhiều người dùng phổ thông khó tiếp cận. PEPENODE giải quyết triệt để vấn đề này bằng cách ảo hóa toàn bộ quá trình khai thác, cho phép bất kỳ ai cũng tham gia mà không cần đầu tư hàng ngàn đô vào thiết bị hay trở thành chuyên gia kỹ thuật. Nền tảng cung cấp giao diện khai thác trực quan, hiển thị số liệu theo thời gian thực như hashpower, mức tiêu thụ năng lượng và phần thưởng tích lũy. Người dùng có thể mở rộng quy mô bằng cách mua thêm node hoặc nâng cấp cơ sở khai thác kỹ thuật số, qua đó cải thiện hiệu quả và tối đa hóa lợi nhuận. Trong hệ sinh thái PEPENODE, các quyết định chiến lược đóng vai trò quan trọng: Một số nhà đầu tư chọn đa dạng hóa bằng cách sở hữu nhiều node nhỏ. Ngược lại, có người tích lũy token để thực hiện nâng cấp lớn, gia tăng mạnh hiệu suất khai thác. Chính sự linh hoạt này giúp PEPENODE không chỉ mang tính giải trí như một meme coin, mà còn tạo ra giá trị thực tế cho cộng đồng. Kiếm Tiền Ngay Cả Khi Ngủ Ngoài gameplay khai thác chủ động, PEPENODE còn mang đến cơ hội staking truyền thống cho những ai ưa thích thu nhập thụ động. Người nắm giữ token có thể khóa $PEPENODE để nhận phần thưởng mà không cần phải tương tác liên tục. Tỷ lệ lợi nhuận staking ước tính hơn 4500%, được phân bổ trong vòng hai năm nhằm khuyến khích sự tham gia dài hạn. Chương trình giới thiệu (referral) cũng mở ra cơ hội kiếm tiền bổ sung cho những ai có tư duy cộng đồng. Người dùng nhận 2% phần thưởng khai thác từ những người mà họ mời tham gia nền tảng. Điều này giúp PEPENODE tăng trưởng tự nhiên mà không phụ thuộc quá nhiều vào các chiến dịch marketing tốn kém. Chiến lược kết hợp này cho phép người dùng vừa có thu nhập chủ động từ khai thác, vừa có thu nhập thụ động từ staking. Ví dụ, bạn có thể stake một phần token để nhận lợi nhuận ổn định, trong khi phần còn lại sử dụng cho hoạt động khai thác ảo. Phát Triển Nền Tảng và Kế Hoạch Tương Lai PEPENODE tuân theo lộ trình phát triển bốn giai đoạn. Ở giai đoạn presale hiện tại, người dùng đã có thể trải nghiệm gameplay khai thác off-chain, trong khi đội ngũ tập trung vào việc mở rộng cộng đồng. Giai đoạn 2: ra mắt token chính thức và kích hoạt đầy đủ nền tảng. Giai đoạn 3–4: giới thiệu nâng cấp node dưới dạng NFT, bổ sung phần thưởng đa token. Người dùng sẽ có cơ hội khai thác và nhận về cả meme coin phổ biến như PEPE hay Fartcoin. Việc niêm yết token được dự kiến diễn ra cả trên các sàn phi tập trung (DEX) lẫn sàn tập trung (CEX), bắt đầu từ cuối năm 2025. Để tham gia presale PEPENODE , người dùng chỉ cần kết nối ví crypto tương thích với website chính thức. Token có thể mua bằng ETH, BNB, USDT hoặc thẻ tín dụng, với mức giá hiện tại chỉ $0.0010242/token. Ngoài ra, tính năng staking ngay lập tức cho phép nhà đầu tư tạo thu nhập thụ động song song với trải nghiệm khai thác ảo.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ZRX|ETH|PEPE|BNB,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-01 13:57:17

Sports betting and online gaming were forever transformed by decentralized networks holding digital coins and smart contracts. Fast deposits and low fees were the initial selling point, however, over time cryptos brought many other benefits regarding transparency, security and fairness. Lately, cryptocurrencies have become a preferred way of payment, giving users more flexibility and control over their funds. The future of the entertainment industry seems to be intertwined with blockchain and decentralized currencies that will change the way people play online. The Rise of Cryptocurrency in Online Betting Cryptocurrency adoption in the gambling industry started off slowly, but quickly gained traction among players. BTC betting sites were one of the first to offer their users the benefits of the blockchain. Today, almost all major platforms have numerous cryptos as part of their payment system, offering players alternatives to traditional financial institutions. There are several reasons why online gambling picked up on cryptos so fast. First, transactions are much more affordable and faster compared to credit cards and bank transfers. Also, cryptocurrencies give international players a chance to take part in online gaming regardless of their geographical location and local regulations. These are bypassed with the use of digital coins that are not subject to the rules of any jurisdiction. All major platforms allow players to deposit, play and withdraw using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Solana, Ethereum or USDT and some altcoins as well. This flexibility brings in millions of new users every day, while building loyalty with the existing ones. Why Bettors and Platforms Prefer Cryptocurrencies For betting platforms adopting cryptocurrency isn’t just about keeping up with the latest trends, but also giving their users the best possible experience where they will have the full transparency of the platform’s operations while eliminating many flaws of fiat currencies. In the past few years, online platforms have almost completely ditched banks and turned to cheaper and faster crypto transactions. Getting coins from a digital wallet to a casino’s account takes seconds, with a small fee even during the busy hours. There are no delays or long waiting times, so players can seamlessly continue their play without interruption. Further, there are no exchange rates that can significantly bite into players’ wallets, which is a boon for international players and platforms catering to players from all corners of the world. Some countries banned betting and gambling money transactions from personal bank accounts, so crypto, being a decentralized currency, can circumvent these regulations by offering players digital coins that hold a real world value. Privacy and Anonymity Players cherish their privacy more than anything, especially when playing online. This is also one of the biggest reasons crypto has gained popularity among bettors. Traditional payment systems require players to share sensitive financial data, such as bank account details or credit card numbers, while cryptocurrencies allow peer to peer transactions without revealing identities. Also, to deposit coins into the casino’s account, players need to create a digital wallet where they will store crypto. To do this, users need only their email, and they can begin transferring the money. This growing demand for privacy has led many operators to introduce features like anonymous accounts, where players can start betting without completing lengthy verification processes. Anonymity coupled with strict privacy proved to be the perfect formula to attract new users who appreciate keeping their sensitive data away from the prying eyes. Instant Deposits and Withdrawals Before cryptos became part of the casinos’ payment system, players had to wait for days for their funds to be available in their accounts. Common delays and absurd fees, along with additional exchange rates for international players, would take out a significant chunk of money. Once cryptocurrencies were introduced on online platforms, players get to enjoy deposits in a matter of minutes, and quick payouts that are usually a result of smart contracts. This is crucial, especially for high rollers who don’t want their game disrupted by a lengthy banking process. Fast and cheap transfers became a staple of any major online crypto casino that cares about its reputation. Players have high expectations when it comes to handling their money, and they prefer it to be anonymous, safe, quick and affordable. By offering cryptocurrencies, online gambling platforms gained the trust of players who, in return, became loyal, returning customers. Bonuses and Tokenized Rewards Crypto online casinos have found new ways to engage players by utilizing blockchain. Since they have lower overhead, platforms are able to offer bigger crypto bonuses, cashbacks, free spins and massive jackpots. This is becoming a common theme among crypto casinos that are seeking to draw in bigger crowds. Some platforms take this further by introducing native tokens or integrating tokenized reward systems. While playing games or betting, players earn in game tokens that can be exchanged for real money, crypto, extra bonuses, rewards, or even traded on the market. Casino websites that switched completely to cryptos, offer their players the opportunity to stake their tokens in exchange for a share of the profits. Tokenization is quickly becoming the next big trend that will blur the lines between playing and investing, and redefine loyalty programs. How Stablecoins Reduce Volatility in Betting Volatility was always a major concern for traders and crypto casino players. Digital currencies are notoriously fluctuating in price several times per day. Sometimes we can see big moves on the market in only a few minutes before the currency goes back into balance. For this reason, players were worried that their winning might lose in value due to the unpredictability of the crypto markets. Some found the solution in waiting for the value to stabilize and then cash out, while others took a safer approach by buying only stablecoins like USDT, or UCDC. They are tied to the value of the US dollar, so 1 USDT is always worth $1, no matter the market conditions. This gives users a greater sense of safety when buying and selling their coins, while keeping all the benefits of real crypto, like fast and cheap transactions. Integrating stablecoins into online casino platforms proved to be the perfect blend of innovation while still staying on top of risk. How Blockchain Ensures Fairness Provably fair gaming became a standard on online platforms. With blockchain technology players can see and check for every outcome once the game is over. On the player’s account, there is going to be a “client seed” that users can compare to the operators’, ensuring the randomness of the results that are generated using cryptographic algorithms, and anyone can verify that the outcome hasn’t been manipulated. The Future of Crypto Betting Platforms The future of online betting looks increasingly tied to blockchain innovation, with some new trends showing up on the horizon. Tokenization is about to take over every online platform in the upcoming years. Players love the idea of having a cut in the casino’s revenue, so they are most likely to stake their tokens as a form of investment. Cross platform asset use is already in the experimental phase, with big potential for the future. Players may soon be able to move tokens, bonuses, or even NFTs across multiple betting platforms. As regulations catch up and technology matures, crypto casinos will become an industry standard rather than a unique occurrence. It’s clear that cryptocurrencies and betting platforms will continue to promote tokens, and digital assets, thereby accelerating the crypto revolution.

The introduction of blockchain technology not only enhances transactions but also introduces novel features that promote transparency and user autonomy. Introduction to Cryptocurrency in Gambling The gambling industry's foray into blockchain began with the introduction of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which facilitated faster and more secure transactions. This has not only attracted tech-savven users but also provided a blueprint for the potential of crypto in online betting. Platforms like BTC betting sites have been pioneers, showcasing the benefits of crypto transactions in real-time. This shift has greatly influenced how transactions are handled, bypassing traditional financial institutions and removing geographical constraints. Optimizing Costs and Efficiency One of the key appeals of crypto betting is the efficiency in managing funds. Traditional banking methods often involve high fees and slow processing times, a stark contrast to the low-cost, high-speed transactions offered by cryptocurrencies. Challenges and Opportunities with Cryptocurrency Use Despite the advantages, the volatility of digital currencies remains a concern. However, platforms are increasingly turning to stablecoins to mitigate these risks, offering a more stable medium for transactions while retaining the benefits of cryptocurrencies. Advantages of Privacy and Anonymity Maintaining privacy is paramount for many online bettors. Cryptocurrencies address this need by enabling transactions without the need to share sensitive personal information, a significant shift from traditional online betting practices. Immediate Transaction Benefits The integration of cryptocurrencies into betting platforms has revolutionized deposit and withdrawal processes. This is particularly beneficial for high-stakes players who require quick turnover times to maintain liquidity. Innovative Rewards Systems Cryptocurrencies have opened new avenues for rewarding users. Many platforms now offer bonuses, cashbacks, and other incentives in crypto, enhancing user engagement and loyalty. Furthermore, some platforms incorporate tokenized reward systems, allowing players to earn and trade tokens within and potentially outside the platform, adding a layer of investment potential to the gaming experience. Ensuring Fair Play with Blockchain The application of blockchain technology extends beyond transactions to enhance game integrity. Provably fair systems enable users to verify the randomness of game outcomes, fostering trust between players and operators. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto in Online Betting The evolution of crypto betting platforms is likely to continue as more advanced blockchain solutions emerge. With ongoing innovations like cross-platform asset utilization and increased tokenization, the future of online betting looks robustly tied to blockchain technologies. As more players and platforms recognize the benefits of this integration, cryptocurrency is set to become a cornerstone of the online betting industry, reshaping it for a digital future.

51019507,570884,1756735153,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51019507.jpeg,Prevendita PEPENODE in Corso: Scopri le Novità,https://bitcoinist.com/prevendita-pepenode-in-corso-scopri-le-novita/,"Le meme coin hanno registrato miliardi di volume di trading lo scorso anno, ma pochissime offrivano una vera funzionalità. PEPENODE vuole cambiare questa narrativa con una presale che va oltre la semplice speculazione. Il progetto introduce gameplay di mining virtuale , meccaniche deflazionistiche di burn dei token e ricompense di staking, creando un’esperienza interattiva. Attualmente, la presale del token $PEPENODE è attiva a $0,0010242 per token. PEPENODE sfida Pepe con funzionalità interattive PEPE si è fatto notare come una meme coin semplice, basata sull’hype della community e sul marketing virale. Il token ha guadagnato enorme popolarità tramite campagne sui social e listaggi sugli exchange. PEPENODE, invece, segue una strada diversa , aggiungendo utilità al concetto di meme coin. Il nuovo progetto offre ciò che PEPE non ha: un vero gameplay. Gli utenti possono acquistare e potenziare miner node virtuali all’interno di un ambiente di mining simulato. Questi node generano ricompense senza bisogno di hardware fisico o competenze tecniche, dando ai possessori uno scopo concreto con i loro token oltre al semplice trading. PEPENODE incorpora anche elementi che gli utenti di PEPE potrebbero trovare familiari. Entrambi i token funzionano su Ethereum e seguono lo standard ERC-20, e entrambi utilizzano meccaniche deflazionistiche per rendere i token più scarsi nel tempo. La differenza principale sta in come avvengono i burn e cosa ricevono gli utenti in cambio. Presale Crypto di Alto Livello con Accesso Anticipato al Mining Virtuale La fase di presale permette ai partecipanti precoci di accedere al gioco di mining virtuale prima del lancio ufficiale del token. Questo crea utilità immediata per gli acquirenti della presale, invece di farli attendere sviluppi post-lancio. I primi partecipanti ricevono miner node più potenti , che generano ricompense maggiori. Questo sistema a livelli incentiva a unirsi prima possibile , a differenza delle normali presale dove gli acquirenti attendono solo che i token diventino negoziabili. È incluso anche un programma referral : invitando un nuovo utente sulla piattaforma, si ottiene il 2% di tutto ciò che mina . In questo modo il progetto cresce in modo naturale tramite il passaparola, senza grandi budget di marketing. Mining Virtuale per Rendere la Cripto Accessibile Il mining tradizionale richiede attrezzature costose e conoscenze tecniche complesse. PEPENODE elimina queste barriere creando un ambiente di mining virtuale accessibile a tutti. I giocatori costruiscono server room personalizzabili e migliorano le proprie strutture direttamente dall’interfaccia di gioco. I miner node virtuali sono motori di guadagno : più node possiedi, maggiore è la potenza di mining. Puoi continuare ad aggiungerne o potenziare quelli esistenti per aumentare i ritorni. Tutto si gestisce da una semplice pagina web che mostra lo stato del mining. La simulazione include elementi visivi che rendono il processo coinvolgente: gli utenti possono vedere hashpower, consumo energetico e progresso dei blocchi. Questi elementi di gioco aiutano le persone comuni a comprendere la criptovaluta senza sentirsi perse o sopraffatte. Tokenomics e Pressione Deflazionistica PEPENODE utilizza un meccanismo di burn legato direttamente alle attività di gioco : Il 70% dei token spesi per l’acquisto o l’upgrade dei node viene bruciato permanentemente Questo crea una pressione deflazionistica costante man mano che gli utenti giocano La fornitura totale diminuisce con l’espansione delle operazioni di mining Le ricompense referral distribuiscono il 2% dei token minati agli utenti che invitano amici Lo staking offre ulteriori opportunità di guadagno La differenza rispetto a PEPE è netta: mentre PEPE brucia token sulle transazioni (deflazione passiva), PEPENODE brucia token quando gli utenti interagiscono attivamente con il gioco, legando la scarsità dei token all’uso della piattaforma. Lo staking offre un’altra opportunità di guadagno: i partecipanti precoci possono ottenere ricompense stimate oltre il 4500% distribuite su due anni. Smart Contract per Operazioni Trasparenti Il progetto opera sulla rete Ethereum più recente ed eco-compatibile . Gli smart contract gestiscono staking, distribuzione delle ricompense e burn dei token. Essendo tutto sulla blockchain, chiunque può verificare il funzionamento. Dopo il Token Generation Event, il progetto passerà da off-chain a on-chain , rendendo il gioco di mining completamente decentralizzato e trasparente. I primi partecipanti riceveranno bonus e riconoscimenti in classifica per il loro coinvolgimento pre-lancio. Sono previste misure anti-bot per proteggere la presale dagli exploit automatizzati, garantendo accesso equo ai singoli partecipanti. Come Partecipare alla Presale PEPENODE La presale accetta diverse modalità di pagamento: ETH, BNB, USDT e carte di credito . Gli utenti possono connettersi tramite MetaMask, WalletConnect o altri wallet Web3 principali. Il prezzo attuale della presale è $0,0010242 per token , con incrementi progressivi man mano che la vendita avanza. I partecipanti possono anche stakeare i token immediatamente durante l’acquisto per ottenere ricompense aggiuntive.

In August 2025, Quid Miner, headquartered in London, UK, announced the launch of a new mobile app, offering multi-currency cloud mining services for mainstream digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP). Users now only need to download the application to directly access the platform’s remote computing power through their mobile phones and obtain daily income without having to purchase additional mining machines or bear the cost of electricity maintenance. Quid Miner makes mining simple and accessible to everyone For the past few years, mining has been almost exclusively for skilled enthusiasts. High power consumption, operational costs, and fluctuating hashrates have deterred many investors. QuidMiner, a new application, changes this dynamic. After registering an account, users simply select the appropriate mining contract. The system automatically allocates data center hashrate to the target cryptocurrency, with daily settlement and real-time visibility of profits. This approach makes mining no longer a “game for professionals”, but a truly universal investment tool. Multiple currency options, more flexible configuration In addition to BTC, ETH, and XRP, this update also supports cryptocurrencies such as DOGE, LTC, SOL, and USDT (TRC-20/ERC-20). Investors can flexibly switch mining targets within the app, freely combining them based on market conditions or personal preferences. Compared with single-currency mining, the multi-currency model can effectively diversify risks. Especially when the market fluctuates, the differences in returns of different currencies can often complement each other, helping users maintain a more stable overall return. How to Get Started with Quid Miner Using Quid Miner is not complicated, the whole process can be completed in just a few steps: Create an account: Users can register via email, which takes about a minute to complete. They will receive a $15 reward and can start their mining experience immediately. Options: The platform offers a variety of computing power contracts of different sizes, and investors can flexibly choose according to their own budget. For more contract information, please visit the Quid Miner platform official website: https://quidmining.com/ Complete payment: Supports multiple mainstream cryptocurrencies for payment, and the operation process is simple and smooth. Start mining: After the payment is completed, the system will automatically allocate computing power, and users can view real-time earnings at any time in the application. Withdraw earnings: When earnings reach the minimum withdrawal limit specified by the platform, funds can be transferred directly to your personal digital wallet. The withdrawal process is safe and efficient. Transparent mechanism, clear and visible benefits Quid Miner introduces real-time revenue statistics within the app, allowing users to view daily returns, contract terms, and principal status at any time. The platform does not charge any additional hidden fees, and all rebates are distributed on time according to established rules. Upon contract expiration, the principal will be automatically returned without any additional action. This “profit + principal return” model provides investors with a greater sense of security and makes long-term participation more controllable. Long-term value, not short-term speculation In the rapidly changing crypto market, frequent transactions often come with significant uncertainty. Quid Miner advocates for returning investment to long-term value creation through shared technology infrastructure. Without having to constantly monitor price fluctuations or take risks in market fluctuations, users can simply set up a contract and rely on stable computing power to earn continuous returns. This method provides a new path for those seeking passive income and stable financial management. About Quid Miner Quid Miner was founded in 2018 and is headquartered in London, UK.

However, price action has entered a consolidation phase, with bulls struggling to reclaim higher levels and momentum appearing muted. This has fueled speculation across the market, as analysts remain divided on ETH’s next move. Related Reading: Solana Investors Cash Out Nearly $1-B As SOL Tests Key Price Level Some market participants expect Ethereum to retrace below $4,000, pointing to weakening momentum and sustained resistance near the $4,600–$4,800 range. They argue that a correction could provide healthier conditions for the next major leg upward. On the other hand, more optimistic analysts see this consolidation as a launchpad for a breakout, with ETH potentially pushing above the $5,000 mark in the coming weeks if demand remains strong. Supporting the bullish case, CryptoQuant data reveals that despite Ethereum’s ongoing correction following its recent all-time high, demand for ETH remains robust. Exchange reserves continue to trend lower as investors withdraw their holdings, while onchain activity highlights persistent accumulation. This divergence between price volatility and underlying demand suggests that ETH fundamentals remain solid. Ethereum Demand Remains Strong Despite Correction According to CryptoQuant analyst Crypto SunMoon, Ethereum continues to demonstrate strong investor interest despite its recent price correction. After reaching new all-time highs, ETH has entered a consolidation phase, pulling back from peak levels. Yet, unlike many assets that typically see declining demand during corrections, Ethereum’s fundamentals show a different picture. Data highlights a clear divergence between Ethereum and Bitcoin reserves on Binance. While Bitcoin reserves have remained relatively stable, Ethereum reserves have shown a persistent downward trend. This consistent outflow indicates that market participants are actively withdrawing ETH from exchanges, a common sign of accumulation. Investors appear more inclined to hold Ethereum in private wallets or deploy it in decentralized finance (DeFi), reflecting growing confidence in its long-term potential. This trend also aligns with the broader capital rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum that has been unfolding in recent weeks. Reports of whales moving billions into ETH have repeatedly surfaced, reinforcing the narrative that large players are positioning for Ethereum’s next major move. Even as short-term volatility pressures the price, demand dynamics suggest that institutional and whale interest is not only intact but increasing. For many analysts, this divergence between stable Bitcoin reserves and falling Ethereum reserves underscores Ethereum’s leadership in the current market cycle. While BTC remains the benchmark for crypto, ETH’s role as a cornerstone of DeFi, Layer 2 scaling, and institutional adoption continues to attract capital. Ultimately, the resilience of Ethereum’s demand during a corrective phase signals strength beneath the surface. If accumulation persists, the consolidation period could set the stage for Ethereum’s next breakout, potentially pushing prices toward the $5,000 level and beyond. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital Sells 1,167 Bitcoin Amid Ongoing Volatility Price Analysis: Holding Key Support Amid Consolidation Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $4,440, holding above key support levels despite recent volatility. The chart shows that ETH has been consolidating after retracing from its recent all-time highs near the $4,900 region. Importantly, the 50-day moving average (blue line) continues to act as immediate support, aligning closely with the current trading zone. The price action reflects indecision as bulls attempt to defend the $4,400–$4,300 zone, which has now become a critical demand area. A breakdown below this range could expose ETH to further downside toward the $4,000 psychological level and the 100-day moving average (green line), which would serve as the next layer of support. On the other hand, reclaiming momentum above $4,600 could pave the way for another test of the $4,800–$5,000 region. Related Reading: Ethereum Demand Climbs As Monthly Transactions Hit New All-Time High From a technical perspective, the consolidation phase appears constructive as ETH continues to trade above its 200-day moving average (red line), highlighting the strength of its long-term bullish structure. While selling pressure remains visible, fundamentals and recent whale accumulation trends provide a supportive backdrop. The coming sessions will be decisive, with ETH needing to hold current support levels to prevent a deeper retrace and set up for its next breakout attempt.

51019578,570574,1756735214,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51019578.jpeg,"Ethereum Foundation Comes Out Of Hiding With Brand New Token, Here’s What It Does",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-foundation-out-of-hiding/,"The Ethereum ecosystem has witnessed a surprising development with the introduction of a new token called BETH (Burned ETH Token). This token, which was recently launched by the Ethereum Community Foundation, is an attempt to reshape how Ethereum’s burn mechanics are understood and applied. Instead of the invisible process of ETH being destroyed under EIP-1559, BETH was created to give the act of burning Ethereum a tangible and trackable form. BETH Makes Burned ETH Visible Under existing Ethereum mechanics, notably EIP‑1559, portions of ETH, such as transaction fees, are destroyed without leaving a trace, serving only to emphasize scarcity. However, ECF’s new BETH changes that. According to the ECF website , BETH is designed to capture and formalize the concept of proof of burn. When users send ETH to the designated contract, it forwards the funds to an irretrievable burn address and also mints an equivalent amount of BETH on a 1:1 basis. The result is that each BETH token functions as a transparent, audit-ready receipt for ETH that has truly been removed from circulation. This means that the more BETH tokens created, the more the number of ETH that have been permanently removed from circulation. Taking to the social media platform X, ECF founder Zak Cole likens BETH to WETH: “BETH is to burned ETH what WETH is to wrapped ETH.” Just as WETH is Ether for smart contracts, BETH standardizes burned ETH, making it usable as a building block for new mechanics, such as burn‑based voting, auctions defined by irreversible token destruction, and even expiring namespaces that require ongoing burn activity to remain active. Despite its potential use cases, BETH is only a token that signifies the burn activity of users. As such, Zak Cole noted that BETH is meant strictly as a receipt and should not be treated as a token with inherent value. Nonetheless, it is easy to argue that turning burned ETH into a token might undercut the point of burning altogether Ethereum’s Burn Mechanics ETH burning on the Ethereum blockchain officially began on August 5, 2021, with the activation of the London hard fork. That upgrade introduced EIP-1559 (Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559), which fundamentally changed Ethereum’s fee mechanism. Instead of all transaction fees going directly to miners, the base fee for each transaction started being burned and permanently removed from circulation. According to data from Ultrasound Money , the total ETH burned from the London hard fork to date is approximately 4.612 million ETH. At the same time, about 8.431 million ETH have been issued since then, meaning the ETH circulating supply has grown by 3.819 million ETH. Ethereum’s transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake in September 2022 helped slow issuance dramatically, and deflation is a more realistic long-term scenario if demand is strong. At the time of writing, 0.339 BETH have been created, according to data from Etherscan.",Ethereum|Beth|ECF|EIP‑1559|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum Blockchain|ethereum news|ethereum price|etherscan|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Proof of Stake|proof of work|Zak Cole,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|FORKS|BLOCKCHAIN|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-01 14:00:14

That’s exactly what makes the current moment so electric. Toncoin and Hyperliquid are both gaining traction as they near key levels, with analysts tracking their price setups. But all eyes have shifted toward BlockDAG(BDAG) , and not just because of a well-timed campaign. With its stunning 2049% bonus drop launched just before Token2049 Singapore, BlockDAG didn’t wait for the market to choose a leader, it went out and claimed the title. It’s not just one of the top trending crypto stories this month; it’s becoming the one other projects are trying to catch up with. Let’s break down what’s happening and why BlockDAG is dominating headlines right now. BlockDAG Drops a 2049% Bonus & Turns Heads Ahead of Token2049 As the crypto world gears up for Token2049 in Singapore, which is one of the most anticipated blockchain events of the year, BlockDAG has already made its move. Instead of waiting in line for attention, the project launched a 2049% limited-time bonus that instantly flipped the script. While other projects are still preparing pitches and posters, BlockDAG stole the spotlight. This isn’t just hype. It’s smart timing. Token2049 is where narratives are formed and leaders emerge. BlockDAG knew that and responded with a bonus that turned interest into action. The offer wasn’t dropped for show, it was designed to dominate. With over $388 million already raised, 25.5 billion BDAG coins sold, and a current presale price of $0.03 in batch 30, momentum is undeniable. Early buyers from batch 1 are already sitting on a 2,900% ROI, and this new bonus has only accelerated things. It’s not a teaser, it’s a closing sprint with massive upside. More importantly, this 2049% bonus isn’t about inflating numbers. It’s about positioning. It instantly pushed BlockDAG to the front of the top trending crypto race. In a sea of presales, it created scarcity, urgency, and visibility all at once. With exchange listings locked and a community ready to scale, BlockDAG is converting hype into hard results, and it’s doing it fast. Toncoin Gears Up for a Breakout as $6.84 Toncoin (TON) continues to stay in the spotlight as daily trading volume pushes past $209 million, signaling a rising wave of interest. After a slight dip of 5%, Toncoin now hovers around $3.12, approaching a key $3.25 support zone. If that level holds, analysts suggest a possible jump toward $3.65 in the short term. But the real excitement lies in its longer-term trajectory. Forecast models are now pointing to a potential climb toward $6.84 in 2025, with some extended targets projecting highs up to $11.34. That range may seem broad, but it reflects a growing belief that Toncoin could become a dominant player if momentum holds. It’s the kind of setup that gets attention from traders looking to get in before the next big wave. With volume climbing and technical setups forming, Toncoin is firmly on the radar of those tracking the top trending crypto contenders for this cycle. Whale Activity Puts Hyperliquid on Watch Hyperliquid (HYPE) has shown impressive strength over the past two months, holding steady near $45.54 despite minor pullbacks. Even with a small 0.68% daily dip, weekly gains of nearly 8% show buyers are still active, and consolidation could be setting the stage for another push higher. The 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $44.21 has emerged as key support, with downside risk increasing only if price slips below $42.57. If that happens, targets as low as $35.42 could come into play. But if bulls regain momentum, $51 becomes the critical breakout zone, and a successful push above it could trigger a rally toward $58, a potential 16% upside from current levels. Market watchers are also closely monitoring whale wallet activity, which is having a growing influence on short-term trends. With both support and resistance lines drawn, traders are watching to see which level breaks first. If it’s upward, Hyperliquid will quickly rejoin the list of top trending crypto names making real moves in the current market. Final Word When it comes to top trending crypto contenders, Toncoin and Hyperliquid offer potential, but BlockDAG has already flipped the switch. With a limited-time 2049% bonus launched ahead of Token2049, over $388 million raised, and 25.5 billion coins sold, this project isn’t following trends, it’s setting them. The timing is perfect, the momentum is real, and the upside is getting tighter by the day. Traders looking for the next breakout aren’t just watching BlockDAG, they’re rushing in. This isn’t just another presale. It’s a market-shifting moment that may not come around again.

However, the asset’s price dynamics are not based solely on the theoretical maximum supply but rather on the amount of XRP that is actually available for trading at any given time. Financial expert Jake Claver recently emphasized this distinction, describing how the available supply plays a greater role in shaping price action than the total supply figure. XRP’s Available Supply Claver recently explored this subject in a video posted on X, where he analyzed how XRP’s available supply could act as a lever on its market value. According to Claver, many investors misunderstand supply dynamics by only considering the full 100 billion token supply figure . He explained that supply and demand dynamics only impact the available supply, and estimated that just 2 billion XRP, possibly even less, is currently accessible on exchanges for active trading. If retail holders are included, this number might increase slightly, but he still suggested that “retail doesn’t hold more than, you know, maybe 1.2 to 2 billion total XRP.” The market cap multiplier effect for #XRP pic.twitter.com/XXr3zA6KZF — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) August 31, 2025 With some retail participants expected to sell at higher valuations , he projected that perhaps another billion tokens could flow onto exchanges if XRP were to trade in the $10 to $100 range. The Multiplier Effect on XRP Valuation The market cap multiplier concept reframes how XRP’s market cap should be understood. Traditional calculations assume that value is distributed across the token’s entire 100 billion supply. However, if only a small fraction is available to trade, then inflows of new capital are concentrated within that reduced pool. Claver suggested that this mismatch can make XRP appear to achieve market capitalizations that would otherwise seem unattainable. For example, if demand drives the price toward double-digit levels , the effective market cap based on circulating liquidity would expand at a much faster rate than standard models project. This is what he referred to as the 50x effect, where limited supply magnifies the impact of demand. Shifting Liquidity at Higher Price Levels Another implication of the multiplier is how liquidity might change as XRP’s price rises. Claver noted that at $10, $20, or even $100, more retail holders would likely sell, increasing the number of tokens available on exchanges.

Until that point, valuation pressure falls on the restricted supply, meaning XRP could move upward more sharply than its nominal supply suggests.

51019697,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/finestel-the-silent-partner-of-the-biggest-crypto-fx-asset-managers,1756735393,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/51019697.jpeg,Finestel: The Silent Partner of the Biggest Crypto & FX Asset Managers,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/finestel-the-silent-partner-of-the-biggest-crypto-fx-asset-managers,"Finestel has been carving out its place in the crypto autotrading ecosystem with software designed for professional traders, asset managers, and fintech startups. In a conversation with CryptoDaily, Hamid Ghasemi (The co-founder & CEO) explained how the company grew from a simple copy-trading service into a full suite of tools for portfolio management, trading automation, and branded white-label solutions. Read this conversation to discover why Finestel has become the hidden hand behind some of the biggest asset managers in the crypto market. Q: What’s Finestel all about, and how’s it changed since day one? Finestel aims to simplify operations for asset managers and traders managing multiple exchange accounts and executing bulk orders, and pursuing growth without high costs. “We started as a copy and social trading platform,” the rep explains, “but we quickly understood that master traders needed something bigger; an all-in-one software to truly manage portfolios, develop strategies, build branding, and generate revenue, not just a simple trade copier. “We saw folks struggling with clunky systems, so we built something better,” the rep adds. Today, it’s a unified crypto API trading, trading automation, portfolio Management, and client management software suite for asset management. It integrates with major exchanges like Binance, Bybit, OKX, Binance.US, Bitget, and KuCoin, and plans are underway to add MT4/MT5 and Forex trading soon. Q: Who’s Finestel for, and what’s the deal with its white-label platform? It’s for pro traders, asset managers, and fintech startups. “Our users want to manage portfolios and look legit,” the rep notes. The white-label platform lets them launch branded trading hubs with custom logos, domains, and interfaces, think a pro platform or app, ready fast. It includes client dashboards for tracking portfolios and billing tools for subscriptions or profit splits, saving managers time while boosting their brand. Q: Finestel’s clearly built for serious asset managers, but how do you create your roadmap and detect their needs so accurately? A: Exactly, asset managers handle big portfolios, so we stay in touch to meet their needs. They were tired of manual trades and flipping between exchange dashboards, so we built our roadmap from their feedback, creating a platform that does it all; no other software is needed. The Signal Bot pulls trades from any custom source, and the TradingView Bot turns chart strategies into orders in under half a second. These save hours and drive profits. Users said we lacked a unified trading terminal, but now it’s here: an advanced dashboard for manual trading across major exchanges. Q: It’s great news that Finestel’s trading terminal is now ready! Please tell me, are there any tools for retail traders on Finestel? A: Yes, mid-level traders and individuals are using Finestel and loving it. I think all traders need automation now, and our automation toolset delivers. They also manage their accounts on different exchanges from our new trading terminal’s single dashboard. It’s a perfect tool for them. Q: Can you tell me about competitors in your market and what sets Finestel apart from them? A: Honestly, some platforms have popped up with tools for asset managers, but they’re small-scale, mostly just automation bots. None offer a white-label solution like ours. Since 2021, we’ve built the full software, and it has been under load till now. I’m proud to say we were the first and now lead the pack. Q: Got a success story to share? We’ve got plenty of success stories, but now I can take a private company from the UAE. Since April 2024, they’ve hit around $100M in assets, pulling in $1M in revenue. Using Finestel, they built a branded automated trading and private fund. Q: How does Finestel keep things secure and reliable? Security’s a big deal. Finestel’s non-custodial setup lets users control their assets via encrypted API keys. “We’ve got dedicated servers, multi-factor authentication, and regular checks,” the rep says. Fast trades and high uptime keep things running smoothly. Q: Why isn’t Finestel as well-known as some of the other trading bot providers? There’s barely any Reddit buzz or user posts in social media about you guys. A: Hell of a question! First of all we’ve been offering our service to bigger users. HNI traders, asset managers, fund managers, etc.. So our major focus hasn’t been retailers and smaller users. But with our new services (tradingview bot, signal bot, trading terminal), more individuals are also able to use our powerful trading execution software. Another reason is asset managers run Finestel behind the scenes, but their own brand is out front with our white-label setup. They keep quiet to avoid tipping off competitors; most of them don’t want others stealing their edge. They’d rather keep us their secret weapon. Q: What’s next for Finestel? We’re eyeing traditional markets with MT4/MT5 and Forex support. “We’re also cooking up AI tools, like assistant bots, to make automation even smarter,” the rep shares. By adding new exchanges and listening to users, Finestel plans to stay ahead of the curve. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

With a suite of comprehensive tools designed to streamline the trading process, Finestel has evolved from a basic copy-trading platform to a robust system enhancing portfolio management and trading automation. The Evolution of Finestel's Services Initially starting as a social trading platform, Finestel quickly recognized the need for more sophisticated tools suitable for high-level trading and asset management.

This setup is complemented by robust security measures including dedicated servers and multi-factor authentication to ensure a safe trading environment. Expansion and Future Directions Looking ahead, Finestel is set to broaden its horizons by integrating with traditional financial markets and incorporating AI-driven tools to further enhance the efficiency of its trading automation software. Q&A Highlights with Hamid Ghasemi, Co-Founder & CEO of Finestel On Finestel's Market Position Despite the high functionality of the platform, Finestel maintains a relatively low profile, often operating behind the scenes to avoid drawing attention from competitors and preserving the competitive edge for their users. Success Stories One remarkable success story is a private company from the UAE which, using Finestel’s platform, managed to grow its assets substantially, reaching impressive figures and establishing a solid presence in the market. Conclusion Finestel continues to be an integral tool for asset managers in the cryptocurrency arena, providing advanced solutions that enhance trading efficiency and security while maintaining a user-centric approach to its service offerings.

This isn’t a distant dream, but a tangible future, according to a leading executive. Thomas Prévot, head of operations for Crypto.com in France, has made an astounding prediction: the number of crypto users could skyrocket to five billion within the next decade. This vision points to a transformative era for digital finance, where billions of people actively engage with cryptocurrencies for their daily needs. Unlocking the Future: Why 5 Billion Crypto Users Are Possible Speaking at the Waib Summit 2025, Prévot articulated a clear path to this massive adoption. He suggests that if the cryptocurrency market experiences just one more significant growth cycle, the user base could expand exponentially. This isn’t merely about more accounts; it’s about five billion individual people embracing digital currencies. Such a surge would firmly establish cryptocurrency as a widespread payment method, mirroring the ubiquity of credit cards today. This projection highlights the immense potential for financial inclusion and global accessibility that cryptocurrencies offer. As infrastructure improves and regulatory frameworks evolve, the barriers to entry for new crypto users are steadily decreasing, paving the way for unprecedented growth. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities for Crypto Users While the vision of five billion crypto users is exciting, achieving it comes with its own set of challenges and remarkable opportunities.

We are already seeing advancements in layer-2 solutions, stablecoins, and user-friendly wallets that are designed to onboard the next wave of cryptocurrency users . Beyond Payments: Diverse Applications for Future Crypto Users The potential for five billion crypto users extends far beyond just payments. While becoming a ubiquitous payment method is a primary driver, the broader utility of blockchain technology offers a rich landscape of applications: Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Offering alternative financial services like lending, borrowing, and insurance without traditional intermediaries. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): Revolutionizing ownership of digital and physical assets, from art to real estate. Web3 and Metaverse: Powering decentralized internet experiences and virtual economies, where users have true ownership and control. Supply Chain Management: Enhancing transparency and traceability of goods across global networks. These diverse applications will attract a wide array of new crypto users , from artists and gamers to businesses and investors, expanding the ecosystem’s reach and impact significantly. Preparing for Mass Adoption: What It Means for Current and Future Crypto Users The prospect of five billion crypto users signals a fundamental shift in how we perceive and interact with money and digital assets. For individuals, this means a future with more financial freedom, faster transactions, and potentially lower fees. For businesses, it opens up new markets, innovative payment solutions, and enhanced operational efficiencies. It’s crucial for everyone to stay informed and adapt. Actionable Insights: Educate Yourself: Understand the basics of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Start Small: Experiment with secure, reputable platforms. Prioritize Security: Use strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and understand cold storage options. Stay Updated: Follow reputable news sources and industry developments. The journey to five billion crypto users is not just a technological evolution; it is a societal transformation. It promises a more inclusive, efficient, and decentralized financial future for people across the globe. FAQs: Your Questions About the Future of Crypto Users Answered Q1: What is the primary driver behind the prediction of 5 billion crypto users?

Tokenomics update makes Sonic scarcer and more valuable. Sonic Labs Targets US Market with ETF and Token Expansion Sonic Labs has received community approval to enter the U.S. capital markets and launch a regulated exchange-traded fund (ETF). The developers aim to raise $150 million to strengthen their presence in traditional finance and increase the appeal of the Sonic (S) token. Major Initiatives and Token Strategy The August 20, 2025 proposal, titled “US Expansion and TradFi Adoption,” outlines two key initiatives. First, Sonic plans to create an ETF with a provider and privately invest $100 million in public capital on Nasdaq. Reserve funds will support token buybacks and stabilize value, with assets frozen for at least three years. Second, Sonic Labs is forming a Sonic USA division, hiring regional managers, and investing another 150 million Sonic tokens into developing its U.S. operations. The company emphasizes its bet on institutional demand, drawing attention from U.S. regulators and institutions. Tokenomics Update and Market Performance The developers also announced a tokenomics update. Redistribution of commissions and Gas Burning will make the Sonic asset scarcer, potentially boosting value. According to CoinGecko, Sonic Labs has a market capitalization of $993 million, with the token currently trading around $0.3085, down 3.6% over the past seven days. In parallel, Sonic Labs continues to develop its EVM-compatible first-level blockchain, launched in August 2024, further expanding the project’s technical and institutional appeal.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-01 14:10:52
51019965,571009,1756735996,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51019965.jpeg,Những Meme Coin Nên Mua Ngay – Dự Án Đang Gây Sốt Trong Giai Đoạn Presale,https://bitcoinist.com/best-meme-coins-to-buy-now-presale-projects-2025-vn/,"Những tuần gần đây thị trường crypto khá biến động, xóa đi động lực của nhiều tài sản lớn. Tuy vậy, trong bối cảnh bất ổn này, meme coin và altcoin lại tiếp tục ghi nhận sức hút mạnh mẽ. Khi sự thống trị của Bitcoin suy yếu, những cái tên như Dogecoin và Shiba Inu cho thấy sự bền bỉ và nhu cầu đầu tư tăng trở lại. Cả hai thậm chí đã bắt đầu quy trình nộp đơn xin phê duyệt ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) – một bước đi quan trọng giúp chúng trở thành hạng mục đầu tư chính thống, không chỉ trong crypto mà còn trong tài chính truyền thống. Sự hợp pháp hóa này đã khuyến khích nhiều nhà đầu tư quay lại với lĩnh vực meme coin, tìm kiếm những cơ hội có thể vượt trội khi mùa altcoin trở lại. Sự Bùng Nổ Của Meme Coin Presale Ngành meme coin đã trở thành một trong những lĩnh vực phát triển nhanh nhất của crypto. Riêng trong năm 2024, vốn hóa thị trường meme coin đã tăng từ 25 tỷ USD lên gần 60 tỷ USD, rồi đạt đỉnh 137 tỷ USD trước khi điều chỉnh – và nhiều chuyên gia dự đoán mốc cao nhất mọi thời đại có thể sớm bị phá vỡ. Presale chính là trung tâm của làn sóng này, khi mang lại cho nhà đầu tư sớm cơ hội sở hữu token với tiềm năng nhân giá trị nhiều lần sau khi niêm yết. Trong khi nhiều người dùng nhỏ lẻ thường chọn các đồng coin vốn hóa lớn để an toàn, thì những nhà đầu tư giàu kinh nghiệm lại đổ vốn vào các presale đầy tiềm năng. Điểm hấp dẫn nằm ở tỷ lệ lợi nhuận vượt trội: một presale tốt có thể mang lại lợi nhuận 10x, thậm chí nhiều dự án còn đạt 100x trở lên nếu có cộng đồng ủng hộ mạnh và câu chuyện (narrative) thu hút. Tìm Kiếm Dự Án Uy Tín Trong Biển Meme Coin Dù vậy, việc tìm ra dự án đáng tin cậy trong một “rừng” meme coin không hề đơn giản. Nhiều dự án được ra mắt với cấu trúc yếu hoặc thiếu bền vững. Ngược lại, những presale hứa hẹn thường có cộng đồng năng động và ý tưởng rõ ràng, đủ sức giữ chân sự quan tâm lâu dài. Theo phân tích, những dự án như vậy thường vượt trội không chỉ khi ra mắt, mà còn duy trì phong độ trong năm đầu tiên giao dịch. Với việc vốn hóa meme coin liên tục mở rộng, cả những cái tên quen thuộc lẫn dự án mới đều góp phần nâng giá trị toàn ngành. Với nhà đầu tư, đây là cơ hội hấp dẫn để khám phá các presale meme coin trong lúc điều kiện thị trường vẫn còn thuận lợi. 3 Meme Coin Tốt Nhất Đang Gây Sốt Hiện Nay – Những Viên Ngọc Presale Bị Đánh Giá ThấpPepenode Pepenode đã nhanh chóng tạo dấu ấn trong không gian meme coin nhờ mô hình kết hợp sự hào hứng của cộng đồng với tính năng tương tác. Trong khi hầu hết meme token chỉ dựa vào thương hiệu và hiệu ứng hype, Pepenode mang đến hệ thống mine-to-earn, biến việc tham gia trở nên hấp dẫn và có giá trị hơn. Nhà đầu tư sớm có thể mua node khai thác và xây dựng cơ sở mô phỏng, đóng góp vào bảng xếp hạng toàn cầu. Cơ chế này tạo ra yếu tố gamification hiếm thấy trong presale, đồng thời đã thu hút mạnh mẽ trên mạng xã hội với hàng nghìn lượt thảo luận trên Telegram và X về tiềm năng dài hạn của dự án. Presale của Pepenode đang tăng tốc, với số vốn huy động đạt gần 500.000 USD ngay ở giai đoạn đầu. Con số này cho thấy nhà đầu tư nhỏ lẻ sẵn sàng ủng hộ những ý tưởng mới mẻ, đặc biệt khi chúng gắn liền với một biểu tượng meme quen thuộc như Pepe. Không ngạc nhiên khi dự án này đã lọt vào tầm ngắm của nhiều KOL hàng đầu như Coin Bunker, những người đã xếp Pepenode vào danh sách meme coin nên chú ý nhất hiện nay trong giai đoạn presale. Linh vật Pepe tiếp tục là một trong những biểu tượng mạnh mẽ nhất của crypto, và việc Pepenode tận dụng nó giúp dự án dễ dàng tiếp cận tệp người dùng rộng rãi. Các nhà phân tích cho rằng những meme coin có yếu tố gamification thường giữ chân cộng đồng tốt hơn, vì chúng khuyến khích sự tham gia vượt ra ngoài tính đầu cơ đơn thuần. Với việc vốn hóa thị trường meme coin tăng trưởng mạnh mẽ trong năm nay, Pepenode được đánh giá là một trong những presale có khả năng mang lại lợi nhuận vượt trội. Nếu đà tăng trưởng hiện tại tiếp tục, dự án hoàn toàn có thể bước ra khỏi “ngách nhỏ” để trở thành cái tên mainstream. TOKEN6900 TOKEN6900 được xem là một trong những màn ra mắt meme coin táo bạo nhất năm, mang đậm bản sắc community-first và khai thác tối đa sự hỗn loạn của văn hóa degen trading. Thay vì cố gắng trở nên bóng bẩy hay kỷ luật, TOKEN6900 lại chọn cách xây dựng thương hiệu hỗn loạn, bùng nổ năng lượng, điều này đã nhanh chóng chạm đến tâm lý của nhóm nhà đầu tư nhỏ lẻ thích sự liều lĩnh và bất ngờ. Hình ảnh của dự án được thiết kế có phần “quá lố”, tạo ra sức hút kiểu cult trên các nền tảng như Telegram, Reddit và X. Chỉ trong vài tuần kể từ khi mở presale, dự án đã thu hút hàng nghìn holder cùng mức độ tương tác cao – minh chứng rằng chiến lược cộng đồng của họ đang phát huy tác dụng. Presale của TOKEN6900 đã thu hút sự chú ý lớn, cho thấy nhu cầu dành cho những meme coin mới với câu chuyện đột phá vẫn còn rất mạnh. Điều giúp TOKEN6900 khác biệt chính là khả năng nổi bật giữa một thị trường quá đông đúc, nơi đa số dự án khó tạo được dấu ấn. Bằng việc vừa tận dụng sức mạnh của meme culture, vừa tổ chức phân bổ token minh bạch, TOKEN6900 đã tạo nên một môi trường nơi đầu cơ được cân bằng bởi định hướng rõ ràng. Theo các nhà phân tích, những dự án như TOKEN6900 thường mang lại đợt tăng giá mạnh ngay khi niêm yết, được thúc đẩy bởi vòng xoáy hype từng đưa PEPE và nhiều meme coin khác lên định giá hàng tỷ USD. Khi Dogecoin và Shiba Inu tiến gần hơn đến việc ra mắt ETF, các presale như TOKEN6900 có cơ hội thu hút dòng vốn từ những nhà đầu tư đang tìm kiếm “cái tên bùng nổ tiếp theo”. Maxi Doge Maxi Doge kế thừa di sản của Dogecoin nhưng mang đến một bản sắc hoàn toàn mới với linh vật “cơ bắp” khổng lồ. Hình ảnh nghệ thuật của dự án mô tả một phiên bản Doge phóng đại, cơ bắp cuồn cuộn – được thiết kế để chinh phục nhóm nhà đầu tư meme coin thích sự hài hước, kịch tính và màu sắc degen. Nhờ thương hiệu mạnh mẽ, Maxi Doge đã nhanh chóng tạo dấu ấn khi presale vượt 200.000 USD ngay trong tuần đầu tiên. Với nhiều nhà đầu tư, Maxi Doge không chỉ là một trò parody, mà còn là điểm hội tụ của cộng đồng trader – những người coi trọng năng lượng tập thể và sự kịch tính của thị trường không kém lợi nhuận tài chính. Sự phát triển của cộng đồng online cực kỳ ấn tượng, với hoạt động sôi động trên X (Twitter) và Telegram, nơi người ủng hộ liên tục lan truyền meme, video và nội dung quảng bá. Đặc biệt, nhà đầu tư nhỏ lẻ rất quan tâm, coi Maxi Doge là cơ hội tiếp cận sớm một cộng đồng đang lên. Dù hiện chưa nhấn mạnh vào tiện ích truyền thống, nhưng giá trị văn hóa lại chính là tài sản mạnh nhất của dự án. Tính đến hiện tại, Maxi Doge đã huy động hơn 1,2 triệu USD, con số đáng nể cho một meme coin chưa có tiện ích lớn. Khả năng tập hợp cộng đồng xoay quanh một biểu tượng meme độc đáo luôn là yếu tố thúc đẩy giá trị trong lĩnh vực này.

Namely, a price sheet posted on X reveals the wallet addresses and promotional rates of over 200 figures in the market recently approached by a project they were meant to promote. However, ZachXBT’s analysis shows that while some 160 accounts accepted the deal, fewer than five actually disclosed their posts as paid advertisements. NEW LEAK: Price sheet of 200+ crypto influencers and their wallet addresses from a project they were recently contacted by to promote. From 160+ accounts who accepted the deal I only saw pic.twitter.com/Kph9dUvDxB — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) September 1, 2025 Unsurprisingly, the leak is raising a number of questions regarding transparency and marketing standards with cryptocurrency , even if most of those featured on the list are “from the most recent class of CT or are just botted accounts.” The growing risk of crypto scams Decentralized finance ( DeFi ) has exploded in recent years, but its expansion has been accompanied by a sharp rise in predatory schemes. In 2024 alone, for example, Americans alone lost $9.3 billion to crypto crime according to the FBI. Accounts impersonating important crypto figures and social media influencers are increasingly more common, with a Nefture Security crime report suggesting that chat platforms such as Telegram played a key role in facilitating fraud. “One common feature shared across 2022, 2023, and now 2024 is that, contrary to popular belief, scam-related activities — not hacks — have been the most devastating for the crypto space.” Accordingly, regulatory and industry responses are intensifying, with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) and the GENIUS Act providing some much-needed clarity. Still, the decentralized nature of the industry limits regulatory effectiveness, especially since cryptocurrency still remains stigmatized in the public eye.

For those invested in the dynamic intersection of technology and finance, particularly within the cryptocurrency space, understanding these pivotal shifts is crucial. Runway AI , a company long celebrated for its groundbreaking generative tools in the creative industry, is now making a significant and strategic pivot. This move isn’t just an expansion; it’s a bold leap into the robotics industry , signaling a new frontier for its sophisticated AI world models and a potential goldmine for future revenue growth. From Creative Visions to Robotic Realities: Runway AI’s Astounding Evolution For the past seven years, Runway has been at the forefront of visual content creation, empowering artists, filmmakers, and designers with cutting-edge tools. Their expertise lies in developing advanced AI world models – essentially sophisticated neural networks trained on vast datasets to create highly realistic, simulated versions of the real world. These models don’t just generate images or videos; they learn the underlying physics, dynamics, and interactions of objects within environments, enabling them to predict and create consistent, believable simulations. Innovations like Gen-4, their acclaimed video-generating model released in March, and Runway Aleph, their powerful video editing model from July, have solidified their reputation in the creative domain. These models have not only enhanced artistic expression but have also laid the foundational technology for their ambitious new venture. The journey from generating stunning visuals for films and digital art to training autonomous machines might seem vast, but for Runway, it’s a natural progression of their core competency in simulation, demonstrating the incredible versatility of their generative AI capabilities. The Unforeseen Opportunity: How AI World Models Caught the Eye of Robotics and Self-Driving Cars As Runway’s AI world models matured, becoming increasingly realistic, robust, and capable of handling complex environmental dynamics, an unexpected wave of interest emerged. Anastasis Germanidis, Runway co-founder and CTO, shared in an exclusive interview with Bitcoin World that companies in the robotics and self-driving cars sectors began reaching out, eager to leverage Runway’s technology. This wasn’t an initial target market for Runway when it launched in 2018; their focus was firmly on the creative industries. “We think that this ability to simulate the world is broadly useful beyond entertainment, even though entertainment is an ever increasing and big area for us,” Germanidis explained. This unsolicited interest illuminated a much broader utility for their models than originally conceived, proving that powerful foundational technology often finds its most impactful applications in unexpected places. The sheer realism and fidelity of Runway’s simulations offered a compelling solution to some of the most pressing challenges faced by developers in autonomous systems. Why the Robotics Industry is Embracing Generative AI for Training The traditional methods of training robots and self-driving cars in real-world scenarios are notoriously expensive, time-consuming, and exceptionally difficult to scale. Consider the immense logistical nightmare and financial burden: fleets of specialized vehicles, expensive sensors, fuel costs, dedicated testing facilities, and a large team of engineers and safety drivers. Each iteration of software or hardware requires repeated, controlled, and often dangerous real-world tests. This is where Runway’s generative AI technology offers a truly transformative solution. Robotics companies are now utilizing Runway’s models for highly detailed training simulations, drastically cutting down on costs, accelerating development cycles, and improving safety. Germanidis highlighted the key advantages: Unprecedented Scalability: Simulations allow for an infinite number of training scenarios to be run concurrently and continuously, something physically impossible in the real world. This means thousands of variations of a specific driving condition or robotic task can be tested simultaneously. Dramatic Cost-Effectiveness: Eliminates the need for expensive physical prototypes, test tracks, specialized equipment, and extensive personnel for every single training iteration. The marginal cost of running an additional simulation is significantly lower than a physical test. Precision and Specificity for Edge Cases: Unlike real-world testing, these models enable engineers to isolate and test specific variables and rare, critical situations without extraneous factors. Want to know how a robot reacts to a specific type of floor texture under low light, or how an autonomous vehicle handles a sudden, complex multi-car pile-up in dense fog? Runway’s models can create that exact scenario, repeatedly, with unparalleled consistency, allowing for deep analysis and rapid improvement. Safety and Risk Reduction: Complex or dangerous scenarios that would be unsafe or impractical to test in the real world can be simulated safely, allowing for the training of robust policies without putting lives or property at risk. “You can take a step back and then simulate the effect of different actions,” Germanidis elaborated. “If the car took this turn over this, or perform this action, what will be the outcome of that? Creating those rollouts from the same context, is a really difficult thing to do in the physical world, to basically keep all the other aspects of the environment the same and only test the effect of the specific action you want to take.” This capability is a game-changer for developing more intelligent, safer, and more reliable autonomous systems. Real-World vs. AI Simulation: A Comparison for Robotic Training Feature Real-World Training AI Simulation (Runway AI) Cost Very High (vehicles, sensors, personnel, infrastructure) Significantly Lower (computational resources) Scalability Limited (physical constraints, time) Near Infinite (parallel processing, rapid iteration) Scenario Control Difficult to replicate specific conditions precisely Highly Precise (isolate variables, create edge cases) Safety Potential for accidents, risk to property/life Zero physical risk Speed of Iteration Slow (physical setup, testing, analysis) Fast (instantaneous scenario generation, data collection) Data Collection Limited by physical environment and sensors Comprehensive, granular data from every simulated element Navigating the Competitive Landscape and Future Directions for Runway AI in Robotics Runway isn’t alone in recognizing the immense potential of AI-powered simulation for the robotics and self-driving car sectors. Industry giants like Nvidia have also made significant strides, with the recent release of their Cosmos world models and other robot training infrastructure. Nvidia’s robust GPU ecosystem and long-standing presence in industrial AI make them a formidable competitor. However, Runway’s unique strength lies in its deep roots in visual generation and world modeling, cultivated through years of catering to the demanding creative industry. This background likely gives them an edge in generating hyper-realistic and visually consistent simulations, which are crucial for effective training of vision-based AI systems. Runway’s strategy is not to create an entirely separate line of models for these new clients. Instead, they plan to fine-tune their existing, powerful AI world models to cater specifically to the nuanced requirements of the robotics industry and autonomous vehicles. This approach leverages their established technological foundation while allowing for specialized applications without fragmenting their core development efforts. To support this strategic expansion, Runway is actively building a dedicated robotics team, signaling a long-term commitment to this burgeoning market and an understanding of the specialized expertise required. The Philosophy Driving Runway’s Pioneering Expansion into Self-Driving Cars and Beyond At its core, Runway’s journey into the self-driving cars and robotics market is driven by a fundamental principle rather than just chasing a market trend. “The way we think of the company, is really built on a principle, rather than being on the market,” Germanidis stated. “That principle is this idea of simulation, of being able to build a better and better representation of the world. Once you have those really powerful models, then you can use them for a wide variety of different markets, a variety of different industries.” This philosophy positions Runway not just as a tool provider, but as a foundational technology company, creating models that can adapt and evolve to meet the demands of an ever-changing technological landscape. This broad applicability is what excites investors. Despite this pivot not being part of their initial investor pitches, Germanidis confirmed that investors are fully on board. With over $500 million raised from prominent backers like Nvidia, Google, and General Atlantic, valuing the company at $3 billion, Runway has significant capital and strategic partnerships to fuel this ambitious growth. This investor confidence underscores the profound belief in the universal applicability and long-term potential of Runway’s simulation principle and their generative AI technology. The Transformative Impact of Generative AI on Future Industries: A Wider Lens The move by Runway AI into robotics and self-driving cars is a powerful indicator of the broader trajectory of generative AI . What began as a tool for creative expression is rapidly becoming an indispensable asset for engineering, research, and development in critical industries. The ability to simulate complex real-world interactions with high fidelity and at scale will accelerate innovation, reduce risks, and democratize access to advanced training methodologies. Beyond robotics and autonomous vehicles, the “principle of simulation” could find applications in: Industrial Design and Manufacturing: Simulating new product designs, assembly lines, and material properties before physical prototyping. Logistics and Supply Chain Optimization: Modeling complex global supply networks to identify bottlenecks and improve efficiency. Urban Planning and Infrastructure: Simulating the impact of new construction, traffic flows, and environmental changes. Healthcare and Drug Discovery: Modeling molecular interactions or surgical procedures in a virtual environment. Environmental Science: Simulating climate patterns, natural disasters, and ecosystem changes. While the benefits are immense, it’s also important to acknowledge the inherent challenges. The “sim-to-real” gap, where models trained in simulation don’t perfectly translate to the complexities of the physical world, remains a hurdle. Continuous real-world validation and iterative refinement are still crucial. However, the dramatic reduction in initial training costs and time afforded by advanced AI world models like Runway’s makes this gap increasingly manageable and the overall development process far more efficient. As these AI world models continue to improve, their applications will only expand, impacting everything from logistics and manufacturing to healthcare and space exploration. Runway’s strategic pivot not only secures a new revenue stream but also positions it as a pivotal player in shaping the future of autonomous systems and intelligent machines, a future that is increasingly intertwined with the advancements in AI.

The company shared on September 1 that it had bought 1,009 BTC for 16.48 billion yen, worth about $112 million. Metaplanet Climbs to Sixth-Largest Bitcoin Holder with 20,000 BTC Bitcointreasuries.net data revealed that this latest buy has pushed Metaplanet to rank the sixth-largest public company holding the flagship crypto, overtaking Riot Platforms. The Tokyo-based firm now holds 20,000BTC in its reserve. According to the disclosure, the coins were acquired at an average price of around $111,068 each. The achievement also highlights how quickly Metaplanet is growing its reserves. Less than three months ago, it held 10,000 Bitcoin. Earlier this year, the company raised its year-end target to 30,000 Bitcoin, tripling its original goal of 10,000. This move underlines Metaplanet’s commitment to building one of the largest corporate Bitcoin treasuries in the world. Metaplanet Unveils $880M Bitcoin Push, Eyes Broader Growth Strategy Metaplanet is not slowing down. Just last week, the company revealed plans to raise 130 billion yen, equivalent to about $880 million, through an international share offering. Most of the funds will be used to buy more Bitcoin over the next two months. CEO Simon Gerovich has also shared longer-term plans. He said the firm may borrow against its crypto reserves in the future to acquire cash-generating businesses. This bold plan shows that Metaplanet views Bitcoin as a store of value and also as a foundation for wider business growth. Metaplanet’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy mirrors the approach pioneered by Michael Saylor, the Chairman and co-founder of Strategy. In 2020, Saylor began shifting his company’s balance sheet into Bitcoin, setting a trend that reshaped how corporations view the asset. Today, the U.S.-based firm holds close to 700,000 BTC, making it the largest corporate Bitcoin treasury holder in the world. By following a similar path, Metaplanet is positioning itself as Asia’s leading player in corporate Bitcoin adoption. Market Reactions and Stock Performance Despite the bold move, Metaplanet’s Tokyo-listed shares dropped sharply. According to Yahoo Finance data, the share price dipped by 2.62% on Monday morning while markets were still open. However, the company’s U.S.-listed stock MTPLF closed last Friday up 0.83% at $6.11. Meanwhile, the top coin asset itself is facing pressure in the crypto market, as it has dropped significantly from its July all-time high. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price is trading at $108,776, up 0.35 % in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.

This event, while routine, always captures the attention of investors and market watchers alike. It prompts crucial questions about market dynamics and Ripple’s ongoing strategy. Understanding the Ripple XRP Unlock Mechanism What exactly is an XRP unlock , and why does Ripple do it? Back in 2017, Ripple committed to placing 55 billion XRP, a substantial portion of its holdings, into a cryptographically secured escrow account. This move aimed to create predictability and transparency regarding XRP’s supply. Each month, approximately 1 billion XRP tokens are scheduled for release from this escrow. Predictable Supply: The escrow system ensures a managed and predictable release of XRP into the market. Transparency: It provides clarity to investors about the circulating supply. Controlled Inflation: By locking up a large amount, Ripple aims to prevent sudden, massive dumps that could destabilize the market. Crucially, any XRP not utilized by Ripple during the month is typically returned to escrow, maintaining a careful balance. This mechanism is central to Ripple’s long-term vision for XRP. What is the Immediate Impact of a Massive XRP Unlock? Whenever a large sum like 200 million XRP is unlocked, the immediate concern often revolves around market impact. Will it cause a price drop? Historically, the market’s reaction to an XRP unlock is often nuanced. While an increase in circulating supply can theoretically lead to selling pressure, these unlocks are largely anticipated events. Investors often factor these routine releases into their trading strategies. Therefore, a sudden, drastic price movement directly attributable to an unlock is not always guaranteed. Instead, the broader market sentiment, Bitcoin’s performance, and other macroeconomic factors often play a more dominant role. It is vital to observe how Ripple actually uses these unlocked tokens. Ripple’s Strategic Intent Behind the XRP Unlock Why does Ripple consistently engage in this monthly XRP unlock process? The reasons are multifaceted and strategic, supporting the growth and operational needs of the Ripple ecosystem. Funding Operations: Ripple uses a portion of the unlocked XRP to cover operational expenses, invest in new technologies, and fund acquisitions. Market Making: A key aspect involves ensuring liquidity for its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product. ODL facilitates instant, low-cost international payments using XRP as a bridge currency. Partnerships and Grants: Ripple also allocates XRP to foster partnerships, support developers, and provide grants that encourage the adoption and utility of the XRP Ledger. Therefore, each unlock is not just about increasing supply; it is a calculated move to fuel Ripple’s mission to revolutionize global payments. Navigating the XRP Market After an XRP Unlock: What Investors Should Know For those invested in or considering XRP, understanding these unlock events is essential. Rather than reacting impulsively to every XRP unlock report, consider a broader perspective: Long-Term Vision: Focus on Ripple’s fundamental developments, partnerships, and the utility of XRP in cross-border payments. Monitor Usage: Pay attention to how Ripple communicates the use of its unlocked tokens. This provides insight into their strategic priorities. Market Context: Always evaluate unlock events within the context of the overall cryptocurrency market and global economic trends. Risk Management: As with any investment, never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversification remains a wise strategy. In conclusion, the recent 200 million XRP unlock is a standard part of Ripple’s transparent escrow management. It represents a continuous effort to provide liquidity, fund innovation, and drive the adoption of XRP globally. While these events are closely watched, their impact is often a reflection of Ripple’s strategic utilization rather than a simple supply increase. Staying informed and adopting a long-term view can help investors navigate these routine but significant market occurrences. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Ripple’s XRP escrow system? Ripple’s XRP escrow system locks up a significant portion of XRP (55 billion initially) to provide predictability and transparency regarding its circulating supply. It releases a set amount, typically 1 billion XRP, each month. 2. How often does an XRP unlock occur? An XRP unlock is scheduled to occur monthly, with approximately 1 billion XRP being released from escrow. Any unused portion is usually returned to the escrow account. 3. Does an XRP unlock always lead to a price drop? Not necessarily. While an increase in circulating supply can theoretically add selling pressure, these unlocks are anticipated events. The market often factors them in, and the actual price movement depends more on broader market sentiment and Ripple’s specific use of the unlocked tokens. 4. Why does Ripple unlock XRP from escrow? Ripple unlocks XRP to fund its operational expenses, invest in new projects, provide liquidity for its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product, and support partnerships and grants aimed at increasing XRP adoption and utility.

These new campaign formats power the brand-new Buzz system by ChainGPT . Buzz is designed to transform how Web3 projects engage their communities and distribute tokens. Users can visit ChainGPT Pad to participate in Buzz campaigns, including the first-ever Buzzdrop now live . Traditional airdrops often suffer from bot activity and low-quality participation, while IDOs raise capital but generate little organic traction ahead of TGE. Buzzdrops and IBOs solve these problems by tying allocations directly to verifiable social impact, rewarding users for authentic engagement on X (Twitter) and other tasks. How It Works Buzz uses a performance-based scoring system where every post, share, referral, or engagement task translates into Buzz Points. Points are tracked on live leaderboards, and token allocations are distributed proportionally at snapshot. Key features include: Daily Quests : Participants can tweet, stake, read updates, or complete campaign tasks to earn extra XP. Leaderboard Rankings : Participants can climb to the top and boost your share of rewards. Referral System : A custom referral link allows users to earn a percentage of referees’ Buzz and staking points, plus their campaign spend. Quality Bonuses : Posts with strong engagement, visuals, or “smart followers” score higher. Fair Distribution : Caps ensure no single user can dominate; up to 1,000 winners may share a pool in larger campaigns. Buzzdrops Buzzdrops are community-driven token distribution campaigns . Participants earn tokens purely through activity — posting, sharing, and completing tasks. At snapshot, allocations are distributed transparently on-chain, ensuring rewards go to real contributors. IBOs (Initial Buzz Offerings) IBOs combine community engagement with early access allocations. Participants earn Buzz Points through the same activity system, clear KYC requirements, and may then commit stablecoins. Allocations are scaled by impact on the leaderboard, creating a launch that blends fundraising with organic visibility. For Projects Launching on Buzz is designed to be seamless: Projects select Buzzdrop or IBO. Campaign rules, geo-blocks, and token details are set via dashboard. Users connect wallet + X, post content, and climb the leaderboard. Snapshot is taken; allocations are calculated (50% stakers, 50% buzzers, with individual caps). Tokens and rewards are distributed via on-chain settlement. “We’re so excited to launch the Buzz system. Buzzdrops and IBOs truly give projects a launch strategy that is both fair and viral,” said Gintare Kairyte, CEO of ChainGPT Pad. “Communities benefit from real rewards for their activity, while projects enter TGE with momentum and an engaged holder base.” First Campaigns Incoming The first Buzzdrops and IBOs are set to go live with SnowBall Finance, Ekox, and ChainGPT bringing the new system to communities across Web3. Further Buzz campaigns are planned to be announced in the near future. About ChainGPT ChainGPT is an AI-powered Web3 infrastructure provider building tools, platforms, and protocols for the next generation of blockchain innovation. Its ecosystem includes the ChainGPT AI suite (smart contract generator, NFT generator, trading assistant, auditor, and more), ChainGPT Pad (launchpad and incubation hub), the viral Buzz system for community-driven token launches, and the upcoming AIVM blockchain , a Layer-1 designed to support decentralized AI compute and verifiable on-chain execution.

Accompanying the clip, directed by “Atlas Hodl’d,” is a popular quote from the Strategy chairman, where he stated that “whoever gets the most Bitcoin wins.” Michael Saylor on X Michael Saylor on X The message is clear: Saylor wants more Bitcoin and is well in the race to stack more sats. His remarks suggest that Strategy is in the race to hold the most Bitcoin, and whoever does hit this feat has achieved staggering success.It further aligns with his sentiment that Bitcoin is the “cyber Manhattan” and would continue to increase infinitely against the dollar.

While he did not post any purchases on September 1, his clip reassures enthusiasts that Strategy has not backed down on its long-standing quest to buy more Bitcoin.Interestingly, other treasury firms have taken up the challenge, adopting Strategy’s playbook to buy Bitcoin. For instance, Metaplanet bought 1,009 BTC ($112 million) today, bringing its holdings to 20,000 BTC.Strategy Not After the Entire Bitcoin Supply ThoughDespite Strategy’s commitment to hold more and more Bitcoin, Saylor has clarified that it does not plan to acquire all of its supply . Currently, the company holds 3.1% of BTC’s circulating supply, with Saylor aiming to more than double that figure to 7%.He claimed that he wants other firms also to have a share of the scarce asset and benefit from the upsides of holding it.

Recent reports indicate a staggering 200,000,000 XRP, valued at approximately $553 million, has moved from an unknown wallet directly to Ripple. This isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s a move that sparks immediate questions about market dynamics and Ripple’s strategic intentions. Understanding the Scale of This XRP Whale Transfer When we talk about a XRP whale transfer , we’re referring to a transaction of immense size, typically involving millions of dollars. Whale Alert, a well-known blockchain tracking service, first brought this particular movement to light. For context, 200 million XRP represents a significant portion of the token’s circulating supply, making its destination and purpose critically important to market observers. Such large transfers often signal potential shifts in market sentiment or strategic maneuvers by major holders. Here’s what we know: Amount: 200,000,000 XRP Approximate Value: $553 million Source: An unknown wallet Destination: Ripple The sheer volume of this transaction makes it a focal point for investors and analysts alike, eager to decipher its implications. Why Did This XRP Whale Transfer Occur? Exploring Potential Reasons A large XRP whale transfer like this doesn’t happen without reason. Several theories could explain why such a substantial amount of XRP moved to Ripple’s wallet. It’s important to consider various angles, as these movements can influence future market behavior. One primary reason could be related to Ripple’s ongoing operations. Ripple frequently uses XRP for various purposes, including: On-demand Liquidity (ODL): To facilitate cross-border payments for its partners, requiring significant XRP reserves. Strategic Sales: While Ripple has reduced its programmatic sales, it still engages in institutional sales to support its ecosystem and fund operations. Treasury Management: Rebalancing internal holdings or consolidating funds from various sources. Another possibility is that this transfer represents a buyback or a significant purchase by Ripple from a large holder. This could be a move to strengthen their position or manage the circulating supply. Alternatively, it might be a former partner or early investor moving their holdings back to Ripple for an agreed-upon reason. What Are the Broader Implications for XRP and the Market? Any substantial XRP whale transfer inevitably sparks discussion about its impact on the wider cryptocurrency market and, specifically, on XRP’s price and ecosystem. While a transfer to Ripple’s wallet doesn’t automatically mean an immediate sale, it does add to the perceived supply under their direct control, which can influence market sentiment. Investors often watch these large movements closely for signs of: Price Volatility: The potential for such a large amount to enter or exit the market can create price fluctuations. Market Confidence: If interpreted as a strategic move by Ripple, it could instill confidence; conversely, if perceived as a potential sell-off, it might lead to apprehension. Ecosystem Health: Consistent large transfers can indicate active development or ongoing partnerships within the XRP ecosystem. Ultimately, the long-term impact will depend on Ripple’s subsequent actions with these funds. Will they be used to expand ODL corridors, fund new ventures, or be held in reserve? Navigating the Unknown: What Should Investors Watch For? For those invested in or considering XRP, understanding the nuances of a major XRP whale transfer is crucial. While the immediate reaction might be speculation, a more measured approach involves observing Ripple’s official announcements and subsequent on-chain activity. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Ripple’s Statements: Keep an eye on official communications from Ripple regarding their financial activities or new partnerships. Track On-Chain Movements: Follow blockchain analytics to see if the transferred XRP remains dormant or is distributed further. Analyze Market Reaction: Observe XRP’s price action and trading volume in the days and weeks following the transfer. These large movements are a reminder of the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the significant influence that major holders, or ‘whales,’ can exert. Conclusion: A Significant Move in the XRP Ecosystem The 200,000,000 XRP whale transfer to Ripple is undoubtedly a significant event that warrants attention. While the precise intentions behind this massive movement remain speculative, it highlights the continuous activity and strategic maneuvering within the XRP ecosystem. Whether it signifies operational expansion, treasury management, or another strategic play, it underscores Ripple’s active role in shaping the future of cross-border payments and digital assets. As always, staying informed and conducting thorough research remains paramount for navigating the evolving crypto landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an XRP whale transfer? An XRP whale transfer refers to the movement of a very large amount of XRP (Ripple’s native cryptocurrency) by a single entity, often an individual or institution holding a substantial portion of the total supply. These transfers can be worth millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars. Why are large XRP transfers to Ripple important? Large transfers to Ripple’s wallets are significant because Ripple is the primary developer and largest holder of XRP. Such movements can indicate strategic decisions related to their business operations, such as facilitating On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), managing their treasury, or engaging in institutional sales. Does this transfer mean Ripple will sell the XRP? Not necessarily. While it’s a possibility, a transfer to Ripple’s wallet could also be for internal purposes like rebalancing their holdings, supporting new ODL corridors, or even a buyback from a large investor. The actual intent typically becomes clearer through subsequent on-chain activity or official announcements from Ripple. How does a large XRP whale transfer affect the market? A large XRP whale transfer can impact market sentiment, potentially leading to increased price volatility. Investors often watch these movements as indicators of future supply changes or strategic shifts by major players, which can influence buying or selling pressure. Where can I track XRP whale transfers? Services like Whale Alert are dedicated to tracking large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains, including XRP. Many blockchain explorers and crypto news outlets also report on significant whale movements. If you found this analysis insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

According to The Block, the Sonic (S) community, formerly known as Fantom, has approved Sonic Labs’ $150 million token issuance proposal to expand into the US market. The August 20 proposal, titled “US Expansion and Traditional Finance Adoption,” was approved with 99.9% approval. The plan includes designing a $50 million exchange-traded fund (ETF), creating a $100 million treasury of Sonic tokens to be listed on Nasdaq, and establishing a Sonic USA entity in New York. At this point, the proposal included a plan to partner with a top-tier ETF provider to launch a regulated ETF tracking the company's native S token. The Sonic team also announced that it will establish Sonic USA LLC, establishing a US-based CEO and team in New York to facilitate TradFi plans and manage engagement in Washington, D.C. In this regard, the team will use 150 million S tokens (worth $47.7 million) to launch Sonic USA. It was stated that the necessary custody transactions for the plans included in the offer will be carried out by BitGo. Sonic Labs described the proposal as a necessary measure to secure exchange listings, increase competition and introduce a deflationary mechanism.

This development isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s a crucial move that carries substantial implications for the digital asset and its ecosystem. For investors and enthusiasts alike, understanding why this XRP locked event matters is key to grasping Ripple’s ongoing strategy. What Does This Massive XRP Locking Signify? When XRP is locked in escrow, these tokens are taken out of the immediate circulating supply for a predetermined period. Ripple has systematically used this escrow system since 2017 to manage its vast XRP holdings, providing predictability and transparency. This latest lock-up, reported by Whale Alert, follows this established pattern. Ripple’s Escrow Strategy: This mechanism was designed to alleviate concerns about Ripple’s large holdings potentially flooding the market. By transparently locking up a significant portion, Ripple commits to a controlled release schedule. Market Impact: A reduced circulating supply often leads to increased scarcity. This can influence market dynamics and potentially support the asset’s value by balancing supply with demand over time. How Does the XRP Locked Escrow System Function? Ripple’s escrow system operates on smart contracts. It involves cryptographic contracts that automatically release a certain amount of XRP each month, typically 1 billion tokens. These funds are then made available for Ripple to use for various strategic purposes, such as fostering adoption of XRP Ledger technologies, making strategic investments, or supporting development initiatives. Any unspent XRP from these monthly releases is usually returned to the escrow and re-locked for future release, reinforcing controlled supply. This transparent and automated approach helps maintain market confidence, as the community can easily track the movement of these substantial funds. The recent 300 million XRP locked confirms Ripple’s continued adherence to this well-defined, long-term financial management plan. Implications for XRP’s Price and Future Growth The consistent locking of XRP locked funds has several long-term implications for the cryptocurrency’s market position. While it doesn’t guarantee an immediate price surge, it certainly contributes to a more stable and predictable supply environment. This stability is often highly welcomed by institutional investors and large-scale participants seeking reliability. Supply Management: By reducing the immediate circulating supply, Ripple actively aims to prevent sudden market shocks that could arise from large, uncoordinated token dumps. This proactive management creates a more orderly market. Projected Growth: A predictable supply schedule allows for better long-term financial modeling and informed investment decisions. This strategy aligns with Ripple’s vision for XRP to serve as a global bridge currency. Community Trust: Ongoing transparency and consistent execution of the escrow strategy build trust within the XRP community, demonstrating Ripple’s commitment to its financial strategy. What Challenges and Opportunities Arise from XRP Locked Events? While the locking of XRP locked tokens offers numerous benefits, it also presents unique challenges and opportunities. For instance, market reactions to monthly releases can sometimes introduce short-term volatility as traders anticipate potential selling pressure. However, the overarching strategy aims to mitigate these effects by making releases predictable. Opportunities: Increased scarcity over time can potentially drive demand and long-term value appreciation for XRP. A predictable and transparent supply schedule helps attract greater institutional interest. Funds released from escrow can actively fuel ecosystem growth, support new partnerships, and fund innovative projects. Challenges: Market speculation surrounding monthly releases can indeed lead to temporary price fluctuations. The sheer volume of XRP that remains locked can still be perceived as a potential future supply overhang by some. The recent report of 300 million XRP locked in Ripple’s escrow serves as a powerful reminder of the company’s meticulous and transparent approach to managing its digital assets. This ongoing strategy of controlling the circulating supply through smart contracts is not merely a technicality; it’s a foundational element designed to foster stability, predictability, and long-term growth for the XRP ecosystem. As Ripple continues to push for global adoption, these strategic moves play a vital and pivotal role in shaping XRP’s future trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is XRP escrow? A1: XRP escrow is a mechanism used by Ripple to lock up a large portion of its XRP holdings using smart contracts, releasing a fixed amount monthly to manage supply and provide market predictability. Q2: Why does Ripple lock XRP in escrow? A2: Ripple locks XRP to manage the circulating supply, prevent market saturation, and demonstrate a commitment to a transparent and controlled release schedule, fostering trust and long-term stability. Q3: How often does Ripple lock or release XRP from escrow? A3: Ripple typically locks up a large portion of XRP initially and then releases a predetermined amount, often 1 billion XRP, from escrow each month. Any unspent XRP is usually re-locked. Q4: Does the locking of XRP affect its price? A4: While not a guarantee of immediate price increase, locking XRP reduces the circulating supply, which can contribute to scarcity and potentially support its value over the long term, creating a more stable market environment. Q5: Where can I track XRP escrow movements? A5: You can track XRP escrow movements through blockchain explorers and services like Whale Alert, which monitor large transactions and report on significant lock-ups and releases.

The community vote closed Sunday, recording 99.99% support from 105 participating wallets. Plus, with over 700 million tokens involved, the proposal comfortably met the S token participation quorum. After the vote, Sonic shared on X, saying , “Sonic is coming. Governance passed. Stay tuned.” Sonic revealed plans to launch Sonic USA LLC Sonic plans to back a Nasdaq-listed PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) vehicle with S tokens worth $100 million , plus another $50 million will fund an ETP (Exchange Traded Product) on the S token, which will be custodied by BitGo. According to the company, the ETP is set to be issued by a prominent regulated ETF issuer with significant assets under management. Founded in 2013 and headquartered in Palo Alto, California, BitGo is one of the largest crypto custody firms in the U.S. But its services go beyond storage—clients can also borrow, lend, and trade directly on the platform. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan, from January to June, BitGo’s assets under management reportedly surged from $60 billion to $100 billion. The company attributes this growth to stronger regulatory frameworks and rising crypto adoption. Early investors, including Goldman Sachs, DRW Holdings, Redpoint Ventures, and Valor Equity Partners, now find themselves eyeing a potential public exit. The company recently filed for an IPO confidentially, just as crypto markets continue to climb and Washington finally acknowledges the industry’s presence. To advance their strategic interests in the United States, Sonic is also establishing Sonic USA LLC, led by New York employees who will lead the firm’s activities in Washington, D.C., and more broadly in finance. So far, its recently opened office is funded with 150 million S tokens, worth nearly $47.7 million. FantomOpera rebranded to Sonic and officially launched in December 2024, in which FTM tokens were converted to S on a 1-to-1 ratio. Back then, Fantom Foundation had less than 3% of the beginning supply left, focusing more on buybacks than partnerships. But Sonic’s team says the old token structure was holding back its growth, keeping it from strategic deals with companies such as GameStop, Robinhood, and Polymarket, and holding up early listings on major exchanges. Reportedly, with so little supply held, only a fraction of what other similar projects hold, around 50%, Sonic was said to be buying tokens from the open market to fulfill its plan’s needs. The firm even commented, “We have 2018 tokenomics. We need 2025 tokenomics.” Sonic wants to change its gas mechanism to address the added issuance Sonic is also trying to recreate its gas mechanism to combat new tokens in circulation, which will burn a larger percentage of fees, thus reducing inflation and creating long-term deflationary pressure. The approach will enable the company to interact with traditional finance instruments, such as ETFs and PIPEs, while safeguarding token holders. However, the S token has dropped around 69% since January, according to figures from CoinGecko. The blockchain company was also mentioned among the participants of an effort by the U.S. Department of Commerce to put economic data on-chain using Chainlink and Pyth oracles. That integration would allow developers to incorporate U.S. macroeconomic data directly on the Sonic network. The company added that it has the potential to unlock completely new use cases, from making trading strategies based on economic data to using macro data for on-chain lending If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This significant movement immediately raises questions about its implications for the digital asset’s market dynamics and Ripple’s long-term strategy. Understanding the role of XRP escrow is crucial for anyone following the trajectory of this prominent cryptocurrency. What is XRP Escrow and Why is it Crucial? At its core, escrow involves a third party holding assets on behalf of two other parties until certain conditions are met. In the context of Ripple, XRP escrow refers to a mechanism where a portion of the total XRP supply is locked away using smart contracts on the XRP Ledger. These smart contracts ensure that the locked XRP can only be released at predetermined times or under specific conditions. This process is not arbitrary; it is a fundamental part of Ripple’s strategy to manage the supply of XRP. By locking up large amounts of XRP, Ripple aims to bring predictability and stability to the market. This controlled release schedule helps prevent sudden supply shocks that could impact price and investor confidence. It demonstrates a commitment to a structured and transparent distribution model for the digital asset. How Does Ripple’s XRP Escrow System Work? Ripple initially placed 55 billion XRP into a series of escrow accounts in December 2017. These accounts are designed to release 1 billion XRP each month. Any XRP not sold or used within that month is then placed back into a new escrow contract, set to expire in 55 months. This systematic approach ensures that the vast majority of XRP remains locked, only becoming available in a controlled manner. The locking of 400 million XRP, as reported by Whale Alert, is a standard part of this ongoing process. It signifies the regular re-escrowing of unused tokens, reinforcing the programmed release schedule. This transparent system allows market participants to track the supply and understand the maximum amount of XRP that can enter circulation at any given time, fostering trust and reducing uncertainty. What Does This 400 Million XRP Escrow Lock Mean for the Market? The locking of 400 million XRP in escrow has several key implications for the market and investors. Firstly, it reinforces the controlled supply narrative. When large amounts of XRP are locked, it reduces the immediate circulating supply, which can be a positive factor for market stability. This predictable supply management helps mitigate concerns about potential large-scale selling by Ripple. Supply Predictability: Investors can anticipate when new XRP will enter the market. Market Stability: Reduces volatility associated with unpredictable supply changes. Investor Confidence: Demonstrates Ripple’s long-term commitment to the asset and its ecosystem. This mechanism also highlights Ripple’s strategic use of its holdings. The funds released from XRP escrow are typically used for various purposes, including funding development, supporting partnerships, and promoting the adoption of the XRP Ledger and its associated technologies. This structured release ensures that resources are deployed strategically, benefiting the entire ecosystem. Looking Ahead: The Future of XRP Escrow and Ripple’s Vision The continued operation of the XRP escrow system is a testament to Ripple’s long-term vision for the digital asset. It underpins the company’s efforts to position XRP as a leading solution for cross-border payments and institutional use cases. As the crypto landscape evolves, the transparency and predictability offered by this escrow mechanism remain a significant advantage for XRP. Ripple’s commitment to this structured release schedule signals stability and a measured approach to market participation. This strategy aims to build a robust and sustainable ecosystem around XRP, attracting more developers, businesses, and financial institutions to leverage the XRP Ledger for their needs. The regular escrow locks are not just technical events; they are strategic moves designed to secure XRP’s future in the global financial system. Conclusion: The Enduring Importance of XRP Escrow The locking of 400 million XRP in escrow at Ripple, as reported by Whale Alert, is more than just a routine transaction; it is a powerful reaffirmation of Ripple’s commitment to market stability and transparent supply management. The XRP escrow mechanism plays a vital role in shaping investor confidence, ensuring predictable supply, and supporting the strategic growth of the XRP ecosystem. As the digital asset space continues to mature, such structured approaches become increasingly important for fostering trust and driving long-term adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the main purpose of XRP escrow? The main purpose of XRP escrow is to manage the circulating supply of XRP, ensuring a predictable release schedule and fostering market stability by preventing large, sudden dumps of tokens. How much XRP was initially placed into escrow by Ripple? Ripple initially placed 55 billion XRP into a series of escrow accounts in December 2017, representing a significant portion of the total supply. How often is XRP released from escrow? Typically, 1 billion XRP is released from escrow each month. Any unspent XRP from that release is then re-escrowed for a future date. Does XRP escrow affect the price of XRP? While many factors influence XRP’s price, the escrow system contributes to price stability by creating a predictable supply, which can positively influence investor confidence and reduce volatility. Is the XRP escrow system transparent? Yes, the XRP Ledger is public, and the escrow contracts are smart contracts, meaning their terms and the amount of locked XRP are verifiable and transparent to anyone.

Instead of broad rallies, the market is rewarding projects tied to platforms, communities, or public figures. MemeCore, Pump.fun, and Monero have all attracted attention in recent sessions, each drawing buyers for very different reasons. The strength of these tokens underlines how altseason functions in stages. Traders look for tokens with turnover, narrative hooks, or repeat participation. That framework explains why MemeCore has rebounded after community activity and why Pump.fun benefits from the constant use of its launch system. MemeCore (M): Community Rebound After August Pullback MemeCore is trading near $0.77 , with a price surge of 70% over the past seven days and a market capitalization of around $820 million. Daily turnover is close to $200 million, and the circulating supply is roughly 1.6 billion tokens. The project set an all-time high of about $1.06 earlier in August before retreating. The token has since recovered nearly 60% in the past week, supported by renewed community campaigns and social media engagement. The project positions itself as a meme ecosystem token that can sustain liquidity through repeat activity. Trading platforms continue to list M, which helps maintain visibility. Its current movement shows how community energy can restore interest even after a sharp pullback. Pump.fun (PUMP): Launch Platform Activity Maintains Volume Pump.fun is trading at around $0.0035, with a market capitalization of $1.2 billion. Circulating supply is estimated at 354 billion tokens out of a 1-trillion maximum. Daily volume is close to $290 million, and the price has increased more than 20% over the past week. PUMP Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) The token underpins a platform on Solana that allows rapid creation and listing of meme assets. Thousands of tokens have been launched through Pump.fun, and fees from those launches provide recurring activity. Even if many of the tokens created do not persist, the process itself keeps PUMP liquid and supports trading. This continuous stream of new projects explains why the token maintains turnover through altcoin season cycles. Monero (XMR): Privacy Token Remains Active Despite Broader Market Trends Monero is currently trading near $265 , with approximately $80.3 million in 24-hour trading volume and a market cap of around $4.89 billion. Circulating supply stands at roughly 18.446 million XMR, and the token has no fixed maximum supply. Price movement over the past day shows modest growth of about 2%, and the token remains far below its all-time high of about $517.60 from mid‑2021. This stability suggests continued interest from its core user base, even when broader crypto trends fluctuate. Monero is designed to preserve transaction privacy by default. The protocol uses ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential transactions to obscure the sender, the recipient, and the amount. These features have made Monero a primary choice within privacy-conscious circles. Altcoin Season Takeaway The movement of these tokens shows how altcoin season unfolds unevenly across categories. MemeCore draws strength from social engagement. Pump.fun remains liquid through constant token creation. This variation shows that altcoin season is not defined by every token moving together. Instead, specific drivers create a concentration of flows, whether through community campaigns, platform use, or public figure associations. For now, MemeCore, Pump.fun, and Monero represent three distinct examples of how this selective rotation is unfolding.

He says there is a 20% chance in 2030 that quantum machines could break Bitcoin’s encryption, with the risk climbing higher in 2040. He is calling for preparation through quantum-resistant cryptography. For Bitcoin and Ethereum, this warning underlines the need for urgent planning. Investors are asking what crypto to buy now as the market searches for assets that can withstand future shocks. Among them, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is standing out. Bitcoin & Ethereum Face Quantum Uncertainty Bitcoin has been operating securely under its ECDSA system. Yet Vitalik Buterin has warned that a powerful quantum computer could calculate private keys from public keys, enabling theft or transaction manipulation. Even if the risk is not immediate, the idea of such disruption is forcing attention toward resilience. Moreover, the wider crypto market is reflecting on whether Bitcoin is still the best crypto to buy now when future security remains in question. On the other hand, Ethereum developers have been preparing for the challenge. Buterin has been urging quantum-safe cryptography through options like lattice-based systems and hash-based signatures. Ethereum’s proactive stance signals its intent to keep its network secure. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Traction Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is at the presale phase that occupies the sixth of eleven stages of progression and its tokens are currently valued at $0.035. The project initially opened with a minimum price of $0.01; it has marked by 250 percent, and the trading price is currently exceeded 3.5 times higher. The presale drawn 15,880 holders. Phase six is set to occur in a timely manner, and that Phase seven will increase the price to $0.04. Furthermore, the amount of investor commitments has gone past $15.22 million. The launch price will be fixed at $0.06, which implies that existing purchasers would have gains of 300 percent to 500 percent post-launch. Furthermore, early participants are securing tokens while the discounted supply is still available. Utility Driving Long-Term Value Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a two-way lending system that combines peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract lending. This design is enabling lenders and borrowers to interact directly, avoiding middlemen. Over-collateralised loans are expected to keep the system stable while Layer-2 integration reduces gas fees and increases transaction speed. In addition, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is introducing an overcollateralized stablecoin, minted only during loans and burned on repayment, supporting price stability. This utility is attracting investors who are looking for the best crypto to invest in during uncertain times. Security And Community Trust A CertiK audit of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with the established score of 95.00 and no critical vulnerabilities spotted has already been fully passed. It includes a live bug bounty program, which over buy with CertiK which compensates critical, major, minor and low-level findings with a bug bounty totaling $50,000. In parallel, a new dashboard has launched featuring a leaderboard for the top 50 holders, who will receive bonus tokens for maintaining their positions. These moves are strengthening confidence in the project. Why Mutuum Finance Stands Out Quantum computing may challenge older blockchains, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already securing its place in tomorrow’s market. Preparation is happening through strong tokenomics, proven security, and community incentives. Investors searching for the crypto to buy now in light of Vitalik Buterin’s warning can consider Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a forward-looking choice built for resilience.

One of the on-chain metrics currently taking center stage in its market dynamics is the Buy/Sell Pressure Delta. Buy-Sell Pressure Delta Flashes Market Shift For Tron With a recent report from Darkfost, an on-chain expert and author, Tron appears to be nearing a decisive moment in its market trajectory and investor sentiment. The on-chain expert shared the development on the social media platform (X) after examining the key Tron Buy/Sell Pressure Delta. Specifically, the buy-sell pressure differential is incredibly useful for determining periods when the market reaches extreme situations or when buyers start losing strength. This is indicated by a large delta value or by a negative delta when sellers lose steam. In the meantime, Darkfost highlighted that the buy-sell pressure delta for Tron has fallen to a crucial level of about -0.0015. Such a drop in the buy-sell pressure delta implies that sellers are clearly losing momentum. Given the delicate balance of investor opinion, Tron’s short-term prognosis may be greatly impacted by the next developments in its market dynamics . According to the expert, this drop is generally regarded as a powerful and reliable buy signal, particularly in volatile conditions where liquidity remains tight. As seen in the past, this type of signal has been quite accurate and reliable for the network throughout this year, frequently coming before significant price increases. Therefore, a new and exciting investment opportunity might be forming for market players and long-term investors looking for asymmetric upside. A Historical Moment Loading Amid this weakening sell pressure, TRX is on the verge of breaking its historical resistance level. Tron charges forward towards this crucial level, as daily active addresses on the network have risen to an all-time high of over 2.6 million. According to CryptoOnchain, this reflects a strong increasing trend and a notable rise in network activity , indicating substantial network demand. Looking at the TRX All-Time High chart, TRX is situated just under its historical resistance, pointing to a possible breakout. With TRX at the verge of a breakout, CryptoOnchain has two potential scenarios for the token. Should a valid breakout occur, the first price objective might be between $0.48 and $0.52. This price range is in alignment with the TRX On-Chain Value Bands chart, which determines the top price based on the realized price. While approaching its historical resistance, the expert has warned that it is crucial to remember that if the price doesn’t hold steady above the ATH and the DAA (Daily Active Addresses) begins to decline, the bullish scenario is invalid. In this scenario, the breakout might not hold, and the price might drop. With the possible start of Altseason , the expert noted that the likelihood of a breakout and TRX hitting the $0.50 mark becomes higher. However, this is particularly likely if network demand stays strong and the number of active addresses continues to increase.",Crypto News|altseason|CryptoOnchain|DAA|Daily Active Addresses|Darkfost|tron|Tron Buy/Sell Pressure Delta|trx|TRX On-Chain Value Bands Chart|TRX price|trxusd|TRXUSDT,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRX|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-01 16:00:03

The weekly performance shows a decline of over 4%, and intraday movement in the past 24 hours has shown swings between $2.71 and $2.85. This price movement is part of a selling pressure that has been building up since XRP lost its grip above $3 on August 28. Interestingly, a technical outlook suggests that this selling pressure might eventually cause XRP’s price action to crash down to $1. Technical Analysis Points To Breakdown Although XRP is currently showing signs of exhaustion just below $3 after its rally in July and the first half of August, many analysts would argue that the rally is still on track to resume anytime soon. However, a technical analysis on the TradingView platform has outlined a distinctly extended bearish scenario for XRP based on its price movements on the three-day candlestick timeframe. Related Reading: XRP Price Gets $20 Target: The 2 Scenarios That Could Play Out From Here According to the chart, the crypto’s structure has shifted in favor of sellers after a rejection at $3. Short-lived rallies have failed to produce any significant higher highs on the 3-day candlestick, which has left the trend vulnerable to breakdowns to lower price zones. At the time of the analysis, XRP appeared to have already begun a significant decline from $2.8 and reached into the $2.7 zone. As shown on the price chart above, as long as XRP’s price action is capped below $3, the selling pressure is likely to keep dominating. The projection shows extended downside moves that could send XRP closer to the $1 mark, with the imbalance from the late 2024 rally leaving few technical supports in between. The charts highlight a broader bearish wave that could unfold across 2025 if current support levels fail. In such a situation, the token could not only slide below $2 but also risk plunging directly beneath $1 into the $0.70 to $0.50 price range. This bearish target aligns with the imbalance block that was left behind during XRP’s near-vertical rise earlier in the cycle. Revisiting this level could serve to restore market equilibrium before any chance of a meaningful long-term recovery. XRP’s Price Action At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.82, down by 0.5% and 4.4% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively. This drop is part of a broader crypto market pullback amid the most recent Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index data, which has created some uncertainty over US interest rate cut expectations. However, trading volume and volatility are still high, and XRP has managed to rebound by 4% from its intraday low of $2.71.

This development has placed the digital asset in the spotlight as traders evaluate the potential implications for its next major price movement. Shibo (@GodsBurnt), a crypto enthusiast with more than six years of market experience, highlighted the current setup, drawing attention to a nearly completed cup and handle formation. He believes this could signal the beginning of a significant upward trend, stating that XRP is about to go parabolic. $XRP CUP AND HANDLE HAS FORMED WE’RE ABOUT TO GO PARABOLIC pic.twitter.com/btKCZshPl1 — Shibo (@GodsBurnt) August 31, 2025 Understanding the Cup and Handle The cup and handle is a chart pattern that signals potential bullish continuation after a period of consolidation. It begins with a rounded bottom that forms the “cup,” followed by a smaller pullback resembling the “handle.” This handle usually trends slightly downward or sideways before a breakout occurs. In XRP’s case, the chart shows a well-defined, rounded structure that aligns with the cup, while the recent consolidation pattern near the resistance level represents the handle. The setup suggests that XRP is approaching a critical breakout point that could determine its trajectory for the months ahead. Key Levels and Potential Targets According to the chart analysis, the resistance zone sits near the $3 to $3.5 range. A confirmed breakout above this level would complete the cup and handle formation, opening the door for higher price targets . Traditional technical analysis of this pattern often projects a move equal to the depth of the cup, added to the breakout point. Based on the current chart, the projected target lies near $7. If the pattern plays out as expected, XRP could see one of its strongest rallies in recent years. However, like all technical setups, confirmation remains crucial. The handle portion of the pattern indicates consolidation, and the price currently sits above a support level. Until XRP decisively breaks through the ascending resistance above the technical formation with increased volume and momentum, the pattern is not fully validated.

XRP’s chart currently reflects one of the most prominent bullish patterns in trading. With the cup and handle appearing nearly complete, traders are watching closely for a potential breakout above key resistance levels . Presently, the technical outlook suggests that XRP could be preparing for a decisive move. Once the breakout is confirmed, XRP could experience the parabolic move predicted by Shibo.

Only Under This Critical Condition,https://cryptopotato.com/ada-price-set-for-40-pump-only-under-this-critical-condition/,"TL;DR ADA is down by double digits in the last 14 days, but analysts believe the price may soon surpass the $1 target. Grayscale recently updated its spot ADA ETF filing. The approval odds for that product before the end of the year currently stand at 87%. The Necessary Catalyst Earlier today, the popular X user Ali Martinez forecasted that ADA could hit $1.20 if it breaks $0.88. He thinks such a price expansion is possible in the following weeks. Less than a month ago, he presented a similar theory, envisioning a pump to $1.30 in case of a breakout above $0.84. The X user with the moniker LSTRADER is also among the bulls. They believe ADA could soar to $1 and beyond if the price doesn’t lose the support zone of $0.82-$0.83. On the other hand, Dan Gambardello (who is known as a keen advocate of the asset) made a somewhat controversial statement. He doubled down on his previous opinion from January when saying the Cardano Foundation “has failed the Cardano ecosystem” due to not launching stablecoins and its lack of support for native tokens. “I’m glad most of Cardano are starting to realize how unproductive and useless Cardano Foundation has actually been. So many chains getting deals done with government and enterprise , and CF has accomplished nothing. Not even Chainlink integration. Just need to point this out,” his latest statement reads . On the other hand, Gambardello said he remains “very bullish” on Cardano. ADA ETF Knocking on the Door? Another major catalyst that could give the token a price boost is the potential approval of the first spot ADA exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. The company willing to launch such an investment vehicle is Grayscale, and recently, there have been some developments surrounding that initiative. Just a few days ago, the entity updated its application by submitting S-1 forms for a spot ADA ETF and a spot DOT ETF. S-1s provide detailed information about the structure of the products, how they operate and track the underlying assets, who the custodians are, the associated risks, and more. As of this writing, the chances of a spot ADA ETF receiving a green light before the end of 2025 stand at 87% – a sharp rebound from less than 60% less than a month ago.

Well, there is now – crypto’s first and only mine-to-earn meme coin, PepeNode (PEPENODE) , is upon us, raising $524,000 in days. And this isn’t a project that promises the earth and delivers vaporware. On the contrary, you can start mining from the get-go. Get involved with PepeNode today, and you can become a virtual miner of meme coins straightaway. Build rigs, earn rewards, and burn supply in PepeNode’s gamified mining system, and all before the token is live. PepeNode does an excellent job of combining the worlds of memes and mining. Its gamified mining mechanics are married with meme culture in an interactive model designed to keep the community coming back for more while underpinning value with a deflationary economic model. PepeNode token is currently priced at $0.0010366, but there are less than 24 hours before the next of multiple scheduled price rises, so it pays to get in early. PepeNode is digging deep! 500k Raised! pic.twitter.com/nCIzAESZHb — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) August 30, 2025 Why the world’s first mine-to-earn meme coin will be hugely appealing PepeNode is easy to understand, and that’s part of its appeal. Mining with PepeNode doesn’t require hardware, energy, or specialist tech knowledge. It is a virtual mining system with a built-in reinforcement engagement loop. PEPENODE token holders buy mining nodes in their own server room. Different types of nodes can be brought together to optimize the hashpower and generate rewards. Approximately 70% of tokens allocated to upgrades are permanently burned. This deflationary mechanism creates price-supportive economics for the PEPENODE native token. While it is in the presale stage, the mining is off-chain. Users can begin staking in the off-chain version right now and start earning rewards before the TGE. Later users will compete on a leaderboard for the chance to win even more rewards. All rewards will be trackable on a real-time dashboard, with incentives granting top performers bonus meme coins, such as PEPE and FARTCOIN and others. Put simply then, PepeNode transforms staking into an interactive, mine-to-earn meme coin experience. PEPENODE’s off-chain to on-chain transition will be seamless, making the presale even more attractive When the token launches, the off-chain system transitions over to on-chain. The blockchain technology ensures that all rewards, burns and payouts are calculated and seamlessly migrated transparently and efficiently. In a nice touch to encourage early adoption, a tiered rewards system skewed in favor of the early entrants is included. Tiered node rewards are paid based on higher mining rates for the early buyers. This approach helps to provide retail users who join early an edge, helping to mitigate the impact of whales who might otherwise end up in a dominant position at a later stage. There is also a 2% referral system to incentivize users to spread the word about PEPENODE. PepeNode is an Ethereum powerhouse – ETH recently hit an all-time high Because PEPENODE runs on Ethereum through its compliance with the ERC-20 standard, there is best-of-class integration with industry-leading wallets, exchanges, and DeFi platforms. Smart contracts handle all the business and mining logic. Staking, mining, referral rewards, token burns, and payouts are secured with Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Ethereum is the world’s leading smart contract platform, and the price of the token recently hit a new all-time high of $4,954. Institutional investors are beginning to appreciate its worth as the backbone of disruptive breakthroughs such as stablecoins and tokenization. Its deployment as the core tech behind PEPENODE is also making waves. The PepeNode ecosystem is powered by 210 billion PEPENODE tokens. Every aspect of the network’s utility involves transactions fuelled by the PEPENODE native token, be it miner node purchases to build out your server room or facility upgrades. Mine Better. Faster. Stronger… With PEPENODE https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/O6qm8N2e2y — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 1, 2025 PEPENODE is a meme coin with accessible utility baked in from the outset With PepeNode , utility is baked in from the beginning. Investors aren’t relying on blind faith in a whitepaper and roadmap. Instead, they can judge this project by using an actual working staking product. Because this first stage of the roadmap is already up and running, user activity will be able to feed directly into scaling up the project on-chain in the full mine-to-earn game. The presale is just the beginning of the journey, with rewards and the staking dashboard already live. Next comes the TGE, along with decentralized exchange listings and miner node utility. The third stage sees the shift to on-chain, which will include NFT-based upgrades and a raft of leaderboards. The final part of this initial iteration of PepeNode is topped off with meme coin rewards denominated in top meme coins like PEPE, supported by influencer-driven airdrop campaigns. The gamified mining will also be going mobile to maximize adoption potential. YouTube crypto expert Jacob Crypto Bury, who has 58k subscribers, has selected PEPENODE for his audience to consider as a 10x gains prospect. As the only mine-to-earn meme coin in crypto, with its strong association with the Pepe brand and low cap pricing, there is likely to be plenty of upside for this one-of-a-kind meme coin. How to get in the PepeNode price action before it hits exchanges Presales provide investors with a chance to buy up-and-coming coins before the rest of the crowd and, crucially, before they land on exchanges. PEPENODE is slated to list in Q4 2025. Not only do early buyers guarantee a slot on the top tier for more valuable rewards, but there is also the chance of maximizing returns on both a rising price and the passive income from staking and mining rewards. To buy PEPENODE early, go to the PepeNode presale site. There, you will find ETH, BNB, and USDT (ERC-20 and BEP-20) crypto payment methods, in addition to credit or debit cards. You can also purchase PEPENODE directly in Best Wallet, rated one of the best crypto and bitcoin wallets . The Best Wallet app can be downloaded from Google Play or the Apple App Store . At the time of writing, staked PEPENODE can earn a dynamic yield of 3,180% , although the APY is set dynamically and will fall as the amount of staked tokens rises. Prospective investors will be pleased to know that crypto security firm Coinsult has audited the PepeNode smart contract and found no critical issues.

Specifically, the country’s cryptocurrency portfolio shed more than $22.8 million in value over the past seven days, according to data retrieved from DropsTab on September 1. The weekly decline reflects a 3.25% drop in Bitcoin prices, which fell to around $108,764 per coin. El Salvador Bitcoin portfolio. Source: DropTab Despite the setback, El Salvador’s overall Bitcoin investment remains in massive profit. The nation currently holds 6,262 BTC, valued at roughly $680.77 million. The figure represents a 126.51% gain on its total investment of $300.55 million, resulting in an unrealized profit of approximately $380.2 million. El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy Indeed, the portfolio has seen significant swings since El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021. After reaching a recent high near $774.9 million, the holdings have since pulled back by almost $100 million. Notably, President Nayib Bukele’s government has pursued a strict accumulation strategy, consistently buying Bitcoin but never selling, even during prolonged downturns. The approach is part of a broader vision to integrate cryptocurrency into the economy, attract foreign investment, and expand financial inclusion for citizens lacking access to traditional banking. However, critics argue the strategy exposes national finances to severe market risks, given Bitcoin’s history of sharp corrections. Supporters, however, highlight the current $380 million in paper profits as proof that patience has so far paid off.

51024099,570863,1756742979,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51024099.jpeg,Solana en route vers les 300 $ : analyse de la tendance des leviers techniques,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-analyse-tendance-leviers-techniques/,"En août 2025, Solana n’a plus rien du pari marginal qu’il incarnait encore il y a deux ans. Son prix, installé au-delà des 200 $ , donne le ton. Le marché n’hésite plus à parler d’une cible à 300 $ . Certains l’annoncent comme une certitude, d’autres comme une illusion. Mais tous s’accordent sur un point : quelque chose s’est enclenché, et rien ne semble pouvoir ramener SOL en arrière . Solana teste ses limites Les graphiques révèlent une montée régulière . Pas de chandeliers délirants, pas de pumps éphémères, mais une progression patiente. Les volumes suivent. Les ordres d’achat s’empilent, absorbant chaque repli. La cassure des 200 $ a agi comme un signal. Les vendeurs ont reculé. Les acheteurs institutionnels, eux, se sont avancés. C’est désormais eux qui imposent le tempo . Ce qui intrigue, c’est la solidité des supports. Chaque tentative de correction échoue plus haut que la précédente. Le marché se cale comme s’il savait déjà où il veut aller. Et ce point, c’est 300 $. Pas seulement parce qu’il s’agit d’un chiffre rond. Mais parce que c’est une frontière symbolique : celle qui installerait définitivement Solana parmi les blockchains majeures, au-delà de la simple alternative à Ethereum . Les catalyseurs derrière la hausse de Solana Ce n’est pas un hasard si la confiance revient. Le réseau tourne désormais à plein régime . Les applications DeFi explosent, les volumes NFT redémarrent, et les frais restent ridiculement bas. La vitesse est toujours là, mais avec une stabilité que les sceptiques ne pensaient pas possible. À cela s’ajoutent les capitaux frais. Les produits dérivés liés à Solana battent des records d’open interest. Des milliards circulent sur les futures et les options. C’est la preuve que les grands acteurs n’attendent plus la validation de la SEC pour se positionner. Ils jouent déjà le scénario haussier. Ils verrouillent leurs paris sur plusieurs mois, parfois plusieurs trimestres. Et puis il y a l’effet ETF . Le simple fait que Solana figure parmi les dossiers prioritaires a suffi à relancer l’imaginaire collectif. Les gestionnaires voient en SOL le prochain actif à entrer dans le club restreint des produits cotés, après Bitcoin et Ethereum. Le marché anticipe, comme toujours. Pourquoi Solana à 300 $ n’est pas irréaliste Certains diront qu’il s’agit d’une barrière psychologique. Mais les chiffres, eux, justifient l’hypothèse. À plus de 200 $ , Solana capitalise déjà au-delà de 90 milliards . Une montée vers 300 $ porterait cette valorisation autour de 130 milliards . À titre de comparaison, nous restons loin d’Ethereum , et même en dessous d’anciennes capitalisations atteintes par d’autres réseaux lors du bull de 2021. Ce n’est donc pas une folie. C’est une étape logique , cohérente avec l’évolution du marché et les flux attendus. Tant que les fondamentaux tiennent, tant que le réseau continue à délivrer, les investisseurs auront tout intérêt à pousser la machine plus loin. Le rôle des projets satellites Chaque cycle le confirme : quand les majors s’installent, les petites capitalisations explosent. C’est un réflexe du marché . Une fois les grandes positions sécurisées, les investisseurs se tournent vers les paris asymétriques. Ceux où un billet de 1 000 $ peut se transformer en 10 000 $. C’est là que qu’un des meilleurs altcoins entre en scène. Snorter Token, le complément idéal dans une stratégie Solana Snorter Token n’est pas une promesse floue. C’est un bot de trading déjà opérationnel sur Telegram. Sa promesse : exécuter en quelques fractions de seconde des ordres d’achat ou de vente sur les tokens les plus volatils. Détection des arnaques, ordres conditionnels, copy trading, portefeuille intégré : l’outil couvre toutes les failles que rencontrent les traders sur Solana . Ce n’est pas un hasard si sa prévente séduit . Plus de 3,5 millions de dollars déjà levés, avec un prix fixé à 0,1027 $ . C’est la preuve d’un intérêt réel, pas seulement d’un engouement artificiel. Les premiers investisseurs savent qu’une telle utilité, couplée à une communauté active, peut vite devenir incontournable . C’est aussi une manière de diversifier. Solana peut doubler. Mais Snorter Token , avec sa capitalisation encore faible, peut faire bien plus si l’adoption suit. Le risque est plus élevé, mais le potentiel l’est aussi. Ne restez pas spectateur.

This isn’t just speculation; King claims on-chain data reveals millions of dollars worth of WLFI tokens are already being offloaded by those in the know. What Are the Shocking Allegations Against WLFI Insiders? Jacob King, the CEO of WhaleWire, recently made a stark declaration. He asserts that concrete on-chain data points to WLFI insiders actively selling off substantial amounts of tokens. According to King, this activity is not merely coincidental but rather a deliberate and blatant pump-and-dump operation. Such claims, if proven true, highlight a significant breach of trust within the crypto community. The alleged actions suggest a calculated move to inflate the token’s value before cashing out, leaving retail investors to bear the brunt of the subsequent price crash. Understanding the WLFI Token Pump-and-Dump Mechanism A pump-and-dump scheme is a form of market manipulation. Perpetrators artificially inflate the price of an asset, often through misleading statements, before selling their own holdings at a profit. This causes the price to plummet, leaving late investors with significant losses. In the context of the alleged WLFI token pump-and-dump , the accusation is that insiders, privy to privileged information, are initiating this cycle. They would be selling their tokens after a coordinated ‘pump’ phase, exploiting the market’s enthusiasm before it dissipates. The Digital Trail: What Does On-Chain Data Reveal About WLFI? The core of WhaleWire’s claim rests on the analysis of on-chain data. This data, publicly available on blockchain ledgers, records every transaction. King specifically points to the movement of millions of dollars worth of WLFI tokens. Such large-scale sales by known or identifiable insider wallets can often be indicative of coordinated activity. While on-chain data is transparent, interpreting it accurately requires expertise to differentiate legitimate trading from manipulative practices. What Are the Implications for WLFI Investors? If these allegations of a WLFI token pump-and-dump hold true, the implications for current and prospective investors are severe. Investors could face: Significant Financial Losses: The value of their WLFI holdings could drop sharply. Erosion of Trust: Such schemes damage confidence in the project and the broader crypto market. Market Instability: Large-scale insider selling can create volatility and uncertainty. It’s crucial for investors to remain vigilant and conduct thorough due diligence, especially when faced with such serious accusations. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating Crypto’s Treacherous Waters The allegations from WhaleWire CEO Jacob King regarding a WLFI token pump-and-dump serve as a potent reminder of the risks inherent in the cryptocurrency market. While the space offers immense opportunities, it also attracts bad actors seeking to exploit unsuspecting investors. As always, staying informed, scrutinizing claims, and understanding the underlying mechanics of crypto projects are paramount. Investors must prioritize their own research and consider the potential for market manipulation when making investment decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly is a pump-and-dump scheme in crypto? A pump-and-dump scheme is a type of market manipulation where the price of an asset, like a cryptocurrency, is artificially inflated (pumped) through misleading promotions or hype. Once the price reaches a high point, the perpetrators sell off their holdings (dump), causing the price to crash and leaving other investors with losses. 2. Who is Jacob King and what is WhaleWire? Jacob King is the CEO of WhaleWire, a platform or entity that presumably focuses on tracking and reporting significant movements or activities by large holders (whales) in the cryptocurrency market. They aim to provide insights into potential market manipulation or insider trading. 3. How can I verify these claims about WLFI tokens? Verifying such claims involves analyzing on-chain data, which is publicly available on the blockchain. You can track large transactions from specific wallets, look for unusual trading patterns, and cross-reference with market news. However, interpreting this data accurately often requires specialized tools and expertise. 4. What are the risks for current WLFI token holders if these allegations are true? If the allegations of a WLFI token pump-and-dump are true, current holders face a significant risk of their investment losing substantial value. The token’s price could plummet as insiders continue to sell, potentially leading to heavy financial losses for those who bought at inflated prices. 5. What should investors do if they hold WLFI tokens? Investors holding WLFI tokens should closely monitor the situation, conduct their own research, and consider the potential risks. It’s advisable to assess your risk tolerance, diversify your portfolio, and consult with a financial advisor if you are unsure about your next steps.

Minutes ago, WLFI was listed on Binance spot trading. The Binance listing triggered a price surge. The price reached as high as $0.47, but it failed to sustain there and began to decline. Hearing about the Binance listing, early WLFI investors moved their tokens to exchanges to make profits. According to Lookonchain's post, many presale participants are sending their WLFI to exchanges after claiming WLFI tokens. Address 0xC3e7 requested 60 million WLFI worth $19.2 million and deposited it into his Binance account. Address 0x7ed4 requested 53.33 million WLFI worth $17.1 million and deposited it into his Binance account. Address 0x3881 requested 46.67 million WLFI worth $14.9 million and deposited it into its Binance account. As is known, early WLFI investors purchased tokens at very low prices such as $0.05 and $0.015. According to Lookonchain's post, smart investor 6ccDoT made a profit of $263,866 by trading WLFI in less than 10 minutes. Another whale, address 0xA2f2, deposited 10.18M USDC into Hyperliquid to open a WLFI short position with 3x leverage. His current position is 6.84 million WLFI (worth $1.9 million). Meanwhile, the World Liberty Financial team has republished the WLFI token supply details. According to the announcement, 24.67 billion WLFI tokens will be in circulation at launch, representing approximately 24.67% of the 100 billion supply. Accordingly, the initial token supply is approximately 24.669 billion WLFI, of which 10 billion will be allocated to the ecosystem, 7.784 billion to liquidity and marketing, and four billion to public sale participants. *This is not investment advice.

There are only two days to go before T6900 lists on exchanges, and an increasing number of traders and influencers are seeing it as a possible next SPX6900. So far, $3.22 million has been contributed to the presale before claim and launch on Wednesday, September 3, at 2pm UTC, as traders predict 10x gains at listing . Interested crypto watchers should note that the pace of fundraising is accelerating as the FOMO rises, so there’s no time to lose. Like SPX6900, TOKEN6900 takes a satirical swipe at TradFi, the financial policymakers, and associated banksters. While they pretend to be the pillars of the financial world, T6900 is the token that shouts loudly that all that’s solid melts into air, so why not celebrate the asset-lite vacuousness of index meme coins? T6900 trades on nothing except its ability to capture and harness a feeling, a narrative, a vibe. T6900 is the ultimate vibe liquidity token. Oscar Ramos, who has 163k subscribers on YouTube, presents a cogent case for why T6900 will be the next billion-dollar meme coin like SPX6900: TradFi has no plan but T6900 does – it’s the next SPX6900 The attractiveness of TOKEN6900 for degens lies in the irreverent, viral-powered punch in the face it gives to legacy finance and all its ills. As Mike Tyson famously said: “Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.” That’s right – TradFi has no plan. As the traditional markets wait with growing anticipation for the Fed to lower rates and unleash more liquidity into the system, T6900 followers couldn’t really care less. For sure, lower rates help risk assets like crypto but there are also dangers for legacy finance that meme coins don’t need to worry about. The Fed’s Jerome Powell is walking a tightrope between igniting inflation or triggering a recession. His dual mandate is to keep prices low and employment high, but right now that’s a tough call. There are signs that inflation is strengthening, but not so much that it would lead to a delay in the expected rate cuts, probably of 25 basis points. Yet economists keep insisting that the tariff will increase prices, although that seems yet to filter through as companies absorb some of those costs themselves instead of passing the cost on to consumers. However, that approach cannot continue indefinitely without hurting profits. This week, unemployment claims, non-farm payrolls, and unit labor costs data are all on tap, so market participants should expect volatile prices across markets, including crypto. Yet for T6900, the near-term noise and the bigger long-term macro outlook are positives, regardless of how things pan out. If crypto markets turn higher on the back of this week’s data, those buying T6900 token before it comes to market will sit pretty, as sentiment around listing day will favor bulls. Paradoxically, bad news on employment and payroll would indicate that the economy is losing some momentum, which would make it more likely that the Fed cuts not just once but perhaps twice before the year is out. Again, that would be a filip for crypto and T6900. Then we zoom out and consider the emerging macro background, and there are a number of factors that savvy crypto investors should be cognizant of. tungtung red claw panda style pic.twitter.com/tUEDWZtP9s — Token6900 (@Token_6900) August 31, 2025 Does T6900 vibe liquidity have more integrity than the Fed? The tailwinds of regulatory loosening in the US, a demand explosion driven by the rising number of digital asset treasury companies, and the likelihood of US interest rate cuts, are all music to the ears of crypto traders. But so too is the recent dip in prices because it opens up entry points for those with money parked on the sidelines. And there are factors that the market is perhaps overlooking, chief among them the creeping encroachment on the independence of the Fed. The damage this is doing to US credibility at the governance and market integrity levels could be seismic, playing to the strengths of T6900 (and SPX6900) as the fortune tellers of emerging calamities and the repositories of new forms of ‘vibe liquidity’ wealth. The threat to American economic ascendancy informs the policy direction of the Trump White House, but in practice, it could be aiding its adversaries, as is being demonstrated today at the gathering of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, at which 40% of the world’s population is represented. What were fashioned as weapons to advance US interests, such as tariffs and dollar-denominated stablecoins, could turn out to be the opposite. Trade wars have alienated the so-called BRICS countries, which include giants such as China, India, and Russia. Remember, in purchasing power parity terms, Russia is the world’s fourth-largest economy, according to the CIA World Factbook . Russia is turning to crypto in a big way. Cheekily positioned meme coins like T6900 could be one of the major beneficiaries. SPX has a $1 billion market capitalization. Source: CoinGecko If you’re looking for a hedge against legacy finance brain rot, T6900 is your friend Meanwhile, stablecoins seem like a win-win for the US. On the one hand, dollar-denominated stablecoins are currently dominant, and they are invariably backed by near-cash instruments like short-dated US Treasuries. However, there is nothing to stop other countries issuing their own stablecoins, pegged to their domestic currencies. A yuan-denominated stablecoin could be attractive to economic actors around the world who have grown tired of the US throwing its weight around. Again, T6900 provides a ready vehicle for anyone who wants to hedge their bets on the continued global supremacy of the US dollar as the reserve currency of choice. But it is also a hedge against the brain-rot finance represented by the world’s central bankers, incumbent financial institutions and profligate governments. From the US to China, there is a massive buildup of debt that will need to be rolled over at some point, and that means more monetary debasement. Against that backdrop, the frivolous, humor-based networks of token holders that develop into powerful community-infused commitments to a financial revolution to serve the many, not the few, become more attractive by the day. It could be that meme coins like T6900 are a more solid offering than the fiat money valuation based on not much more than thin air. bounggggg pic.twitter.com/fF6xfkKoe6 — Token6900 (@Token_6900) August 29, 2025 2 days left to buy T6900 cheap There are only two days left to buy TOKEN6900 for the one-time cheap price of $0.007125.

51025732,https://cryptonews.com/?p=416726,1756745870,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51025732.jpeg,South Korea FSC Chief Nominee Under Fire for Calling Crypto Worthless,https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korea-fsc-chief-nominee-under-fire-for-calling-crypto-worthless/,"South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) chief nominee Lee Eok-won is facing criticism from the crypto community following his assertion that cryptocurrencies are worthless. In written responses submitted ahead of his confirmation hearing, Lee stated that cryptocurrencies lack intrinsic value, unlike traditional financial products such as deposits and equities. Lee argued that cryptocurrency volatility prevents them from fulfilling essential functions of a currency, including serving as a store of value or a medium of exchange. 금융위 후보자가 원화맥시 이름값 하시네.. ""가상자산은 내재적 가치가 없어 예금이나 증권 같은 전통적 금융상품과는 다르다"" ""가격 변동성이 큰 만큼 가치 저장이나 교환 수단 등 화폐 본연의 기능을 수행하기 어렵다"" ""노후 안정적 소득 보장을 목표로 하는 퇴직·개인연금 투자에는 적절치 않다"" pic.twitter.com/w4wSYMVDy5 — Cyp3er (@cyp3er) August 31, 2025 South Korea FSC Nominee Sparks Outrage With “Anti-Crypto” Stance This position aligns with the South Korean government’s stance that virtual assets lack intrinsic value and cannot be classified as a currency or a financial product. Lee also expressed reservations about pension and retirement funds investing in crypto assets, citing concerns about market volatility and speculation. Regarding the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, Lee acknowledged the varying expectations and concerns about its impact, stating that Korean authorities will consider global regulatory trends before determining implementation methods and schedules in consultation with the National Assembly. However, Lee indicated support for stablecoin regulation, promising “sufficient supplementary measures while creating opportunities for innovation.” Under President Lee Jae-myung’s endorsement, South Korea is developing regulations for local-currency-pegged stablecoins. The virtual asset industry, however, has criticized Lee’s stance as outdated. Similar “no intrinsic value” arguments were common among figures like Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon from 2017 to 2021, but are now considered inappropriate given the increased adoption of cryptocurrencies. An executive at Xangle, a blockchain data service provider, specifically criticized Lee Eok-won’s statement as one born out of “ignorance and a lack of understanding”. The executive noted that crypto critics often hold traditional stocks, such as Apple, while questioning the intrinsic value of crypto. He compared the traditional payment infrastructure of PayPal to the blockchain platform Hyperliquid, pointing out that Hyperliquid conducted $1.5 billion in token buybacks this year from revenue generated, similar to stock buybacks by PayPal and Apple. “Crypto has no intrinsic value.” That’s what Korea’s nominee for Financial Services Commission, Lee Eok-won, said in parliament yesterday—showing the government’s ignorance and lack of understanding. @HyperliquidX bought back $1.5B worth of tokens this year from its revenues.… pic.twitter.com/RuaeiJ9XjK — KP I Xangle (@KPJang2) August 31, 2025 He added that in just the past month, major projects like Tron generated $430 million, Ethena $68 million, and Pump.fun $42 million, and Ethereum $15 million, which are a testament to the value they create. South Korean Government Tightens Grip on Crypto Adoption However, it appears that South Korea as a whole remains cautious about crypto and virtual assets. In July, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) issued guidance directing domestic firms to limit their exposure to crypto stocks, including those of Coinbase and Strategy, in ETF portfolios. The directive reinforces the South Korean 2017 administrative guidance on virtual currencies, which restricts financial institutions from holding, purchasing, or investing in virtual assets. Similarly, in August, the South Korean FSC issued fresh administrative guidance to exchanges, instructing them to halt operations that allow users to borrow against cryptocurrencies or fiat deposits. Despite regulatory caution, South Korean retail investors are showing growing interest in crypto. Korean investors sold a net $657 million of Tesla stock during August, the largest outflow since early 2023, while pivoting toward crypto investments amid disillusionment with the electric vehicle maker. According to Bloomberg, South Korean investors now favor volatile crypto proxies, such as Bitmine Immersion Technologies, which attracted $253 million in net inflows in August. Data from the Korean Center for International Finance show that retail investors reduced their purchases of U.S. big tech companies from a monthly average of $1.68 billion (January-April) to $260 million in July. It is still unclear whether President Lee Jae-myung’s administration will grant the wishes of those who are willing to accept the risks associated with crypto assets by opening doors through crypto reforms that could facilitate South Korea’s participation in the digital asset sector.

With unprecedented momentum following its rapid presale success and revolutionary AI utility transforming the creator economy, this audited project is capturing institutional attention while establishing itself as the standout $1 candidate of 2025. As sophisticated investors recognize the extraordinary potential within artificial intelligence applications, Ruvi AI’s combination of cutting-edge technology and explosive demand patterns creates the perfect conditions for achieving dollar-level valuation. Record Daily Sales Fuel $1 Trajectory What distinguishes Ruvi AI’s climb to the top of altcoin trends is the extraordinary daily sales volume that reflects genuine institutional interest rather than speculative trading patterns. The project established unshakeable credibility through a comprehensive security audit conducted by CyberScope , a respected third-party auditing firm that thoroughly examined smart contracts and eliminated technical vulnerabilities. This professional validation proved crucial when Ruvi AI secured its strategic listing on CoinMarketCap , the world’s most trusted cryptocurrency data platform. The listing triggered unprecedented institutional recognition that transformed market sentiment, generating metrics that support confident $1 predictions: Almost $3.3M raised with velocity demonstrating serious institutional backing Over 250M tokens sold to a rapidly expanding global investor community A holder base surpassing 3,200 investors , with exponential growth patterns supporting $1 targets These record daily sales showcase organic demand that analysts recognize as foundational indicators for extraordinary appreciation while positioning Ruvi AI at the top of altcoin trends with genuine momentum rather than artificial hype. Revolutionary Super App Powers Creator Economy Domination Unlike speculative cryptocurrencies that compete through marketing alone, Ruvi AI operates within the explosive $104 billion creator economy through its comprehensive super app ecosystem. This strategic positioning creates immediate utility that drives the sustainable demand necessary for reaching $1 valuation while addressing real-world problems that millions face daily. Advanced Trend Research identifies viral topics before mainstream adoption, giving content creators competitive advantages where timing determines profitability and platform success. AI-Powered Script Generation creates platform-optimized content for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram that maximizes audience retention while boosting creator earnings potential exponentially. Native Media Creation generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, eliminating expensive third-party costs that typically drain creator budgets. Streamlined Workflows centralize planning, editing, and scheduling processes for maximum productivity gains across all major content platforms. This utility-first approach creates immediate revenue opportunities for content creators worldwide, establishing fundamental value propositions that support sustained appreciation toward $1 while distinguishing Ruvi AI from trend-following altcoins without genuine use cases. Phase 3 Launch Accelerates $1 Timeline Following record daily sales that position it at the top of altcoin trends, Ruvi AI has entered Phase 3 with unprecedented demand driving tokens at $0.020 . This represents the optimal entry point for investors seeking exposure to potential $1 returns before automatic price mechanisms eliminate ground-floor advantages. Phase 4 will bring an automatic 40% price increment , raising the token price to $0.028 . This guaranteed increase creates immediate catalysts that provide substantial returns before broader market recognition drives the additional appreciation necessary for $1 achievement. The record daily sales demonstrate that institutional interest is accelerating beyond traditional crypto timelines, potentially compressing the path to dollar-level valuation through genuine utility adoption rather than speculative bubbles. Strategic Exchange Partnership Validates $1 Potential The most significant catalyst supporting $1 predictions is Ruvi AI’s strategic partnership with WEEX , a major cryptocurrency exchange. This partnership ensures deep liquidity and professional trading infrastructure that supports record daily sales while providing institutional-grade market access that enables extraordinary appreciation. Exchange partnerships create trading accessibility and institutional validation that accelerate price movements while providing the market infrastructure necessary for sustained growth toward $1 valuation through legitimate market mechanisms rather than artificial manipulation. VIP Program Creates Clear $1 Pathways The record daily sales climbing Ruvi AI to the top of altcoin trends are supported by structured VIP tiers providing mathematical pathways to extraordinary returns at $1 valuation: VIP 2 ($1,000 investment) : Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment) : Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 5 ($10,000 investment) : Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . Beyond structured returns, the competitive leaderboard giveaway system rewards dedicated supporters with additional tokens and exclusive benefits, creating viral community engagement that amplifies daily sales while reinforcing $1 potential through genuine participation incentives. The Next $1 Token Within Striking Distance The convergence of record daily sales, top altcoin trend positioning, professional audit validation, major exchange partnership, and revolutionary utility targeting a massive market creates conditions that position Ruvi AI as the next $1 token. With almost $3.3 million raised, over 250 million tokens sold with unprecedented velocity, and institutional backing through the WEEX partnership, this AI project exhibits the fundamental characteristics necessary for dollar-level achievement.

She mainly alluded to the layer-2 network Shibarium, highlighting how it has maintained its strength over time. Shiba Inu Exec Breaks Silence Amid SHIB Price Crash In an X post , the Shiba Inu marketing lead stated that Shibarium stands apart in the blockchain world as it has no VC funding, no massive exchange alliances, and no corporate safety net. Lucie further remarked that the layer-2 network is being built the hard way, by the community and for the community, which she claims makes the journey more “authentic” despite being demanding. Lucie also mentioned that the obstacles are real, as this is the longest bear market many have ever endured, with the SHIB price underperforming in this market cycle. She noted that as a result, some have lost patience and faith, and have even gone so far as to leave the Shiba Inu ecosystem in pursuit of other opportunities. However, the Shiba Inu marketing lead suggested that she is unfazed by everything that has happened so far, including the SHIB price’s underperformance. Lucie remarked that Shibarium was never meant to be a free buffet for takers and that the mission has always been about gathering those who build together. She explained that these should be builders who expand the table, attract newcomers, and create reasons for investors and partners to support the ecosystem long-term. In line with this, Lucie stated that the solution is not complicated, as Shibarium’s future lies in welcoming new projects, supporting builders, and giving them space to grow. The Shiba Inu marketing lead also alluded to the meme coin’s decentralized nature, noting that there is no obligation and no single authority deciding what must be done. She added that it is a system where value flows naturally to what the community believes in most. The SHIB Price’s Underperformance and Decline In Notable Metrics Lucie’s statement comes amid the massive decline in the SHIB price since the start of the year. Shiba Inu is down 44% year-to-date (YTD) despite the notable gains in the broader crypto market. As a result, the meme coin has continued to drop in the crypto rankings by market cap and is now the 23rd largest crypto by market cap, having climbed into the top 10 last year. Meanwhile, Shibarium’s metrics , including daily transactions, paint a bearish picture for the Shiba Inu ecosystem at the moment. The daily transactions have dropped from an average of 4 million, recorded in early August, to just 8,750, recorded on August 31. These developments come at a time when the Shiba Inu ecosystem is seeking to transition to new leadership, with lead developer Shytoshi Kusama calling for elections. Lucie urged anyone interested in taking the lead to go ahead and bring new ideas, new liquidity, and new volume to the Shiba Inu ecosystem . She noted that the goal is to focus on finding solutions to the mistakes made and leading the ecosystem toward a stronger future for Shibarium. At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at around $0.00001195, down over 3%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Shiba Inu|Coinmarketcap|Lucie|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu ecosystem|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibarium|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT|Shytoshi Kusama|Year-To-Date|YTD,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-01 17:00:12

Toncoin is holding key support levels while SHIB traders eye breakout zones after a golden cross on the charts. Both rank among the top crypto performers in recent updates, yet a new name is quietly stealing the spotlight: BlockDAG. With its presale already past $388M and pushing toward a massive $600M target, the project isn’t just selling tokens; it’s building the kind of liquidity depth and exchange confidence that seasoned investors watch closely. Hitting that milestone could mean stronger market stability, higher-tier exchange listings, and a bigger role in fueling the next bull cycle. At $0.03, BlockDAG looks set to be the only presale worth serious attention before the market’s next major breakout. BlockDAG Targets the $600M Milestone BlockDAG’s presale has already crossed $388 million with over 25 billion BDAG coins sold, pricing now at $0.03 in Batch 30. The goal ahead is clear, reaching $600 million before the presale closes. For traders watching the top crypto performers of 2025, this isn’t just about another token sale; it signals whether BlockDAG can build the liquidity strength needed for a solid launch and future growth. Hitting that $600M mark matters because it gives BlockDAG the depth to withstand sell pressure and attract confidence from major centralized exchanges. Big liquidity pools often mean fewer price shocks at listing, making the token more appealing to both retail traders and institutional players. It turns a presale into something with long-term staying power rather than a short-term pump. The presale energy isn’t slowing down either. A 2049% bonus offer is running until October 1, multiplying token holdings for buyers who enter before the cutoff. Meanwhile, a LIVE AMA on September 4 and a teased sponsorship reveal are lined up to keep the community engaged as the project heads toward its final fundraising stretch. Adding to the momentum, BlockDAG already has 3 million+ users mining BDAG through the X1 app and thousands of X10 miners shipped worldwide, proving there’s activity beyond just token sales. With two whales holding $4.4M and $4.3M each, beating the previous $3.8M record, the leaderboard shows growing confidence among big buyers. If BlockDAG hits its target, it could stand alongside the top crypto performers shaping the 2025 bull run narrative. Toncoin (TON) Price Outlook: Support Levels and 2025 Targets The Toncoin (TON) price outlook shows the token trading near $3.07, a level analysts consider critical for short-term momentum. A rebound from here could push prices toward $3.27–$3.50, with breakout targets at $3.89, $4.21, and even $5.37 if bullish sentiment strengthens. Recent events like the Robinhood listing brought a brief price spike to $3.23 before sellers stepped in, signaling that traders are watching demand zones closely. Holding the $3.10–$3.25 support range is key for any sustained upside in the coming weeks. Looking further ahead, forecasts for the Toncoin (TON) price outlook vary widely. DigitalCoinPrice projects around $6.84 by the end of 2025, while Changelly offers a more optimistic range of $10–$12 if adoption accelerates. CoinCodex models give a broader spectrum, with possible highs near $17.61, though such targets depend heavily on overall market strength and ecosystem growth. For now, Toncoin remains on trader watchlists as it tries to convert strong fundamentals and network activity into higher price levels over the next year. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Prediction: Breakout Signs and 2025 Forecasts The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price prediction has gained attention after technical signals like a golden cross hinted at bullish potential. Analysts point to a cup-and-handle pattern that could support a 70% breakout if momentum holds. Forecasts for August 2025 range between $0.0000121 and $0.0000126, while September could see averages near $0.0000146 with highs pushing $0.0000159. Team statements have also kept traders interested, with Shiba Inu’s marketing lead suggesting the token could eventually surpass its previous all-time high of $0.00008845, though no timeline has been confirmed. Looking at longer-term targets, projections differ widely. CoinCodex gives a broad 2025 range of $0.00001182 to $0.00003120, while Changelly sets possible highs between $0.0000101 and $0.0000445 for the year. Some optimistic scenarios even point to $0.00006392 if adoption improves and burn rates accelerate. Still, recent declines in Shibarium’s daily transactions, from 4 million to around 624,000, could slow near-term gains. For now, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price prediction shows both risk and opportunity as traders weigh technical setups against on-chain activity. Wrapping Up Both Toncoin (TON) price outlook and Shiba Inu (SHIB) price prediction point to active trading weeks ahead, with Toncoin holding near key support levels around $3.07 and SHIB eyeing potential breakouts backed by technical patterns and team confidence. Yet, while traders track these moves, BlockDAG is building toward something bigger. Its presale has already crossed $388M at $0.03, aiming for a massive $600M finish before listing. Hitting that goal could mean deeper liquidity, stronger exchange backing, and a launch position powerful enough to push BDAG into the list of top crypto performers for 2025. With 3M+ miners, major whale buys, and a bonus offer live until October 1, BlockDAG stands as the only presale delivering this mix of scale, adoption, and momentum before the market’s next big breakout.

Claver explains that early planning could be the best way to protect XRP investor gains and keep them safe. According to him, waiting until the windfall is already in their wallet leaves them exposed and unprepared. Get Your Structure In Place Before XRP Profits Arrive Jake Claver’s first piece of advice in his X post is direct: get your structure in place before profits come in. He says many XRP investors are waiting too long, and that delay can lead to risks that are hard to fix later. As a crypto adviser for the ultra wealthy, Claver has seen how fast success can turn into trouble when investors ignore planning. He makes it clear that action must come before the gains, not after.

The crypto adviser stresses that XRP investors need to focus on legal, tax, and security planning while they still have time. If these steps are skipped or delayed, investors may face significant burdens when their coins become of real value. Problems can arise quickly, and once they do, they become more complex and more expensive to resolve. Claver cautions that establishing a structure is not about fear but being smart. Building the right plan now helps investors enjoy their success later without stress. In his view, the best way to secure digital wealth is to take action early, not when the profits are already sitting in the wallet. Trusts, LLCs, And Custody Solutions Built For Digital Assets Jake Claver also points to the tools he thinks work best for building crypto wealth. He says basic templates are not enough for serious investors, and XRP holders need structures made for digital assets if they want their coins to turn into lasting money. The crypto adviser for the ultra-wealthy recommends using digital asset–specific trusts, LLCs, and custody solutions. These solutions could provide XRP investors with lasting financial security, giving them a strong way to protect their wealth and avoid costly mistakes as their digital holdings gradually turn into real money.

With the proper setup, XRP investors can protect their profits, pass on wealth to the next generation, and keep it safe from sudden losses. Claver’s warning is clear, asking XRP investors to act early. By putting these protections in place before profits arrive, they can hold on to the value they have built and avoid risks from waiting too long.

He showed an extended upward trendline on the chart, which has capped XRP’s price since 2021. He emphasized the importance of this multi-year resistance line, noting that XRP might experience another notable growth phase if it can successfully surpass this resistance. Once #XRP breaks this resistance. SKY IS THE LIMIT. pic.twitter.com/KGnDN7g6ov — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 1, 2025 What the Chart Shows The chart, which tracks XRP’s performance against the U.S. dollar on a two-week timeframe, shows the token repeatedly approaching but failing to clear this diagonal resistance. The line links XRP’s high in 2021 with its subsequent rally attempts in 2024 and 2025, suggesting that the market has consistently reacted at this level. The technical picture is straightforward. Since 2019, XRP has experienced cycles of rallies and retracements, but the dotted resistance line has marked a ceiling on upward momentum. The asset reached a peak of $1.96 in 2021, marking the first attempt at this resistance. The asset then went into a multi-year consolidation phase , trading well below the resistance line. The next attempt came during its rally in 2024, culminating in a peak of $3.39 in January 2025. The asset made its most recent attempt in July, rising to an all-time high of $3.65 . However, all attempts failed to breach this resistance. The chart suggests that a breakout above this line could shift XRP into a new trading range. Steph Is Crypto summarized this view, writing that once XRP breaks this resistance, “sky is the limit,” suggesting a phase of price discovery and unprecedented price targets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Expectations and Targets Technical traders typically look for clean breakouts with strong volume to confirm such moves. While Steph did not provide specific targets, his recent analysis set a $7 target for XRP. This is over 2x XRP’s current price, and decisively clearing the multi-year resistance line could open the door to similar levels. However, the asset’s path forward remains uncertain until that breakout occurs. XRP has faced short-term weakness, adding to this uncertainty. The token experienced a huge decline in the final days of August and continued into September , with XRP reaching a low point of $2.71. Failing to clear resistance could lead to another period of sideways trading or a pullback to lower support areas, and XRP must regain its momentum to confirm this breakout and reverse its bearish fortunes.

With Ruvi AI (RUVI) trading at $0.020 during its Phase 3 presale, experts believe this moment mirrors the historic opportunity when Solana was available at $1.80 before its explosive 13,000% rally to over $260. As institutional backing meets revolutionary utility and almost $3.3 million in funding drives unprecedented demand, this audited project is being marked as one of the most promising altcoins of this cycle. The Solana Parallel That Has Experts Excited The comparison between Ruvi AI at $0.020 and Solana at $1.80 stems from fundamental similarities that created legendary wealth opportunities. Both projects entered the market with revolutionary technology, professional validation, and clear utility propositions that separated them from speculative investments. Just as Solana solved critical blockchain scalability issues, Ruvi AI addresses massive pain points within the explosive $104 billion creator economy . What makes this parallel compelling is the professional foundation both projects established before major appreciation. Ruvi AI has secured unshakeable credibility through a comprehensive security audit conducted by CyberScope , a respected third-party auditing firm that thoroughly examined its smart contracts and eliminated technical vulnerabilities. This institutional-grade validation mirrors the technical excellence that propelled Solana’s extraordinary performance. The strategic listing on CoinMarketCap , the world’s most trusted cryptocurrency data platform, triggered unprecedented global visibility that transformed expert analysis into explosive investor action, generating metrics that analysts believe position Ruvi AI for Solana-level success: Almost $3.3M raised with velocity demonstrating serious institutional confidence Over 250M tokens sold to a rapidly expanding global investor community A holder base surpassing 3,200 investors , with exponential growth patterns matching historical breakthrough projects Revolutionary Super App Creates Solana-Level Utility While Solana revolutionized blockchain infrastructure, Ruvi AI has strategically positioned itself to transform the massive creator economy through its revolutionary super app. This comprehensive AI-powered toolkit addresses critical pain points that millions of content creators face daily, creating immediate utility that drives sustainable demand. Advanced Trend Research identifies viral topics before they mainstream, giving users competitive advantages in the fast-moving content landscape where timing determines profitability. AI-Powered Script Generation creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram that maximize audience retention and boost creator earnings potential. Native Media Creation generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, eliminating expensive third-party dependencies. Streamlined Workflows centralize planning, editing, and scheduling processes for maximum productivity. This utility-first approach creates immediate, tangible value that analysts believe provides the fundamental proposition necessary for Solana-level appreciation while marking it as one of the most promising altcoins of this cycle. Phase 3 Window Before 40% Price Surge Ruvi AI has strategically entered Phase 3 of its structured presale with tokens available at $0.020 , creating what experts describe as the final opportunity to access promising altcoin potential at the price point that mirrors Solana’s legendary $1.80 entry. Phase 4 will bring an automatic 40% price increment , raising the token price to $0.028 . This guaranteed increase creates immediate catalysts that provide foundation returns before broader market recognition drives the appreciation necessary for Solana-level performance. Strategic Exchange Partnership Ensures Institutional Access To guarantee seamless market transition and sustained growth toward promising altcoin status, Ruvi AI has secured a strategic partnership with WEEX , a major cryptocurrency exchange. This partnership ensures deep liquidity and professional trading infrastructure that enables institutional participation necessary for Solana-level success. VIP Program Creates Solana-Style Wealth Pathways The most compelling aspect supporting the Solana comparison lies in Ruvi AI’s structured VIP program, which provides clear mathematical pathways to extraordinary wealth creation: VIP 2 ($1,000 investment) : Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment) : Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 5 ($10,000 investment) : Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . Beyond structured returns, the competitive leaderboard giveaway system rewards dedicated supporters with additional tokens and exclusive benefits, creating viral community engagement that drives sustained momentum. Most Promising Altcoin Status Validated The convergence of professional audit validation, revolutionary utility targeting a massive market, strategic exchange partnership, and structured pathways showing clear routes to extraordinary returns creates conditions that analysts believe mark Ruvi AI as one of the most promising altcoins of this cycle. With almost $3.3 million raised, over 250 million tokens sold with unprecedented velocity, and institutional backing through the WEEX partnership, this project exhibits characteristics that enabled Solana’s legendary success.

After a sharp correction in recent weeks, the BTC price has fallen below $110,000. While investors are wondering if and when Bitcoin will bottom, Bitfinex analysts shared their BTC expectations. Bitcoin’s historical bearish patterns and seasonality indicate that the market is actually in the final stages of a correction phase, Bitfinex analysts said in their latest weekly report. Analysts, noting that the bottom is approaching, said on-chain data suggests a possible cyclical bottom of $93,000-$95,000 for Bitcoin. Analysts noted that altcoins also experienced declines and performed worse, reflecting general risk-aversion behavior. Bitfinex analysts noted that despite the decline, institutional demand for ETH remains strong. “Despite Ethereum and altcoins performing poorly, institutional demand for ETH remains strong, pointing to a possible Q4 recovery. September may mark a cyclical bottom before structural drivers re-ignite the recovery in the fourth quarter. *This is not investment advice.

Over a 24-hour window, the asset traded between $849.88 and $868.76, a 2% move that began with bullish momentum but ended with signs of fatigue near resistance. The volatility follows filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by REX Shares late last month, along with the rise of BNB-focused treasury firms. The latest, B Strategy, aims to hold up to $1 billion worth of BNB with backing from the investment firm led by Binance co-founders Changpeng Zhao and Yi He. While BNB failed to hold on to its gains from earlier, underlying network activity surged. Daily active wallet addresses on BNB Chain more than doubled, climbing to near 2.5 million according to DeFiLlama data. Yet, transaction volumes have been dropping steadily since late June, data from the same source shows. BNB’s price drop also comes ahead of key economic data from the U.S. this week, including surveys of manufacturing and services and August payroll figures. Jobs data could influence the odds of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates this month. As it stands, the CME’s FedWatch tool weighs a near 90% chance of a 25 bps cut, while Polymarket traders put the odds at 82%. Technical Analysis Overview BNB entered the session with a surge from $860.30 to $868.08, but the rally quickly lost steam. Heavy selling pressure emerged around the $867–$868 level, a zone that has now established itself as a key resistance ceiling, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. Volume surged during this attempt, peaking at 72,000 tokens, well above the average of 54,000, indicating a high level of participation during the failed breakout. After the rejection, BNB retraced toward the $850–$855 range, where buying interest emerged. This was most visible as the token dipped to $851.40, triggering a volume spike. This response pointed to solid demand at these lower levels.

The company already initiated negotiations with AMD, Cerebras Systems, and Qualcomm to provide the AI chips that will power its AI campus. G42 announced plans to build an AI data center campus with a 5 gigawatt capacity in a collaboration between the UAE and the U.S. The announcement came during President Donald Trump’s visit to the country, which attracted more than $200 billion in signed deals. Trump’s visit secured multiple chip export deals with the UAE, which sparked concerns among senior U.S. officials. They cited national security reasons and economic control surrounding the deals. UAE pushes a ‘digital embassy’ model for governments According to a recent Cryptopolitan report , in July, Huawei was pushing to sell its Ascend 910B AI chips and CloudMatrix 384 systems to G42. However, the discussions remain in the early stages, with no binding agreements formed. The report revealed that Huawei’s chip supply capacity remains limited compared to Nvidia, which already has substantial supply deals in the region. In an exclusive report by Semafor, AWS, Microsoft, Meta, and xAI are among the companies involved in talks with G42 to secure the projected 5 gigawatt data center capacity in the UAE. The UAE has boasted the project as the most significant AI infrastructure outside of the U.S. One gigawatt of the project has already been committed to Trump’s Stargate AI initiative. The Stargate AI initiative aims to advance AI infrastructure worldwide with partners including SoftBank, Oracle, OpenAI, and MGX. President Trump announced early this year that the plan for private sector investment is valued at an estimated $500 billion. G42’s data center campus will utilize Nvidia’s Grace Blackwell GB300 systems, representing about 20% of the campus’s total scope. The facility is expected to launch in 2026. The company is also developing a pitch to governments via a model described as ‘digital embassies’. The model offers secure hosting of national data in the UAE to safeguard against natural disasters, cybercrime, and rising land and energy costs. G42 faces competition from rival Saudi Arabian-backed HUMAIN The UAE-backed project faces competition from Saudi Arabia’s HUMAIN, which is building a 1.9 gigawatt capacity AI data center expected to be achieved by 2030 and expanded to 6 gigawatt by 2034. HUMAIN, backed by the Public Investment Fund, agreed with Nvidia recently to power a 500 megawatt AI data center in the UK. The deal was announced during the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum during Trump’s visit to the region. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, confirmed that they will supply HUMAIN with semiconductor chips to advance the company’s goal of building a 1.9 gigawatt capacity by 2030. Despite concerns from U.S. officials, Trump framed the agreements as part of his strategy to attract foreign investment into the U.S. tech sector. Saudi Arabia has also maintained strong ties with Chinese technology firms as the UAE leans towards the West. Recently, the country secured a deal with Lenovo to manufacture its servers in the Kingdom. Globally, competition may arise from India, which has received several investments in AI data center infrastructure. Cryptopolitan reported that OpenAI is exploring building a one-gigawatt AI data center in the country, which is also part of the Stargate AI initiative. According to projections in the report, India plans to house at least 4,500 megawatts of data center capacity by 2030, with a total investment of around $25 billion. The aggressive AI infrastructure investments follow the recent global AI technology sector boom, with Nvidia recording a 56% year-over-year increase in Q2. The company has projected a revenue of $54 billion in Q3, but analysts warn that its valuation may echo the dot.com bubble, with growth harder to sustain.

ADA price today is holding key support levels, and analysts suggest that a breakout could fuel gains toward $1.30 and beyond. With optimism building around a potential Cardano ETF and strengthening fundamentals, the next few months could determine ADA’s role in the broader altcoin rally. Cardano Price Prediction Shows Resilience Against Market Weakness Cardano is starting Q4 2025 on an intriguing note as ADA price today holds around $0.80 despite market volatility. After weeks of defending support near $0.79 and $0.75, ADA looks poised for a potential breakout that could shape its trajectory into the year’s final quarter. Traders are closely watching the descending wedge formation, a setup that has historically preceded sharp upward moves in similar assets. Momentum indicators such as RSI show ADA in oversold territory, suggesting room for recovery. If the bulls succeed in pushing the Cardano price above the $0.94 barrier, the breakout might be as high as $1.32 and even $1.80. This would mean a 120% rally in the coming months. On the downside, losing the $0.75 support would expose ADA to risks of a retrace near $0.32, but for now, consolidation signals resilience. Institutional optimism is also fueling momentum. Grayscale’s recent filing for a Cardano ETF boosted approval odds to 87%, making headlines across ADA News. A successful ETF launch could bring significant liquidity, mirroring the institutional inflows seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum after their ETF approvals. This catalyst positions Cardano as more than just a speculative altcoin. Its ecosystem continues to expand while long-term holders accumulate, showing confidence in ADA price prediction models pointing higher into Q4. Whether ADA breaks out above key resistance or consolidates longer, the setup for Q4 2025 looks more bullish than bearish, with fundamentals and institutional interest both aligning in Cardano’s favor. Q4 2025 Forecasts Put Utility Altcoins Like Remittix In The Spotlight Remittix continues to stand out in a crypto market that often feels crowded by speculation. While ADA price today hovers near support zones as traders debate its Q4 direction, Remittix has already raised $23 million and sold over 637 million tokens at $0.10. The project’s focus on solving real-world remittance bottlenecks gives it a layer of stability that Cardano News and other legacy projects sometimes lack in the short term. Over $23 million raised in presale funding More than 637 million tokens sold to early supporters Blockchain-powered PayFi solution enabling near-instant fiat conversions Merchants gain stability with auto-settlement into fiat, avoiding volatility This practical foundation has made investors increasingly view Remittix as a “crypto with utility” rather than just another speculative play. At the same time, Cardano price prediction models show ADA may rally if ETF optimism delivers fresh inflows, but it still depends on technical triggers. The balance is clear: ADA continues to consolidate, while Remittix actively builds adoption. For Q4 2025, analysts suggest that investors blending proven altcoins with utility-first projects like Remittix could find the best hedge between stability and growth.

Analysts Predict Major Upside,https://cryptopotato.com/will-pengu-fly-in-september-analysts-predict-major-upside/,"TL;DR PENGU trades in a falling channel, nearing breakout zone with Fibonacci targets up to $0.191. RSI and moving averages show cooling momentum, but the broader uptrend remains technically intact. New Pudgy Penguins game goes live as volume spikes and analysts eye $0.14 resistance zone. Pullback Forms Bullish Setup on the Chart Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is trading around $0.029, showing a decline of 4% in the last 24 hours and 10% over the past week, based on current market data. The recent drop follows a strong rally earlier this summer and has brought the price back into a range seen as a key support zone. On the daily chart, PENGU is moving within a falling channel after a sharp rise from below $0.008 to just under $0.046 in July. The price is now near the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.0317, which is often watched during corrections for signs of a reversal. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez described the current move as a “healthy pullback” and suggested that a new leg higher could form in September. If PENGU breaks above the top of the falling channel, the next price zones could extend to $0.0466, $0.070, $0.098, $0.141, and $0.191, based on Fibonacci extensions. This looks like a healthy pullback for $PENGU before the next leg up. September is going to be lit!! pic.twitter.com/wnbrCFxAS8 — Ali (@ali_charts) September 1, 2025 Analyst Sees $0.14 as Key Target If Support Holds According to @XFinanceBull, PENGU has returned to a buy zone between $0.025 and $0.032. The trendline from earlier this year remains intact, and the price continues to trade above it. “This thing rips past $0.14 easily,” the analyst said , referring to the next resistance level that could come into play if demand increases. A long-term price level of $0.560 is also marked on the chart. While this is far from current prices, it reflects possible upside if adoption continues through products, games, and other use cases that are currently not priced in. Momentum Slows But Broader Trend Still Intact On the weekly chart, PENGU sits under its 9-week moving average ($0.0338), but it is still above the 21-week moving average ($0.0210). This indicates some short-term weakness, but the long-term trend remains intact, provided PENGU does not move below the lower moving average. Meanwhile, the RSI reading of 54 is a little bit below its 14-week average of 55, which indicates some deceleration in momentum. Somewhat more telling is the fact that it is still above 50, which indicates that the buyers are still in control. Source: TradingView Additionally, a mobile game featuring Pudgy Penguins characters launched globally on August 29. Developed in partnership with Mythical Games, the title includes mini-games, digital items, and Web3 features. Mythical is also known for other titles such as NFL Rivals and Blankos Block Party. According to Coinglass, the trading volume increased by 58% to $716.72 million, with open interest declining by 5% to $275.33 million. This indicates some traders are scaling back their positions amid an uptick in short-term activity.

We experience network outages, node operators hack custom scripts together, and scaling feels more like launching a rocket rather than building the future of the internet we imagined. That’s the gap NodeOps aims to bridge. According to Naman Kabra, Co-founder and CEO of NodeOps, the team isn’t just building infrastructure — they’re creating the coordination layer Web3 never had, but desperately needs. NodeOps powers a network of 700K+ users with $150M+ in AUM. With 89K+ machines and 24K+ providers connected, the platform has already generated $4.1M+ in revenue , placing it consistently among the top 10 DePIN projects worldwide for revenue growth. From Fragmented Chaos to Seamless Compute “Most infra stacks in Web3 still feel like early cloud — manual, fragmented, brittle,” Kabra shares in an exclusive interview with CryptoDailyUK. “NodeOps changes that. We automate the full lifecycle of decentralized compute: discovery, deployment, scaling, monitoring, billing. The magic isn’t just automation, it’s that we do it with AI.” The biggest mover is abstraction. Instead of treating validators, GPUs, and storage as separate silos, NodeOps models them all as fungible Compute Units (CUs). Governed by YAML templates and executed by AI, these CUs can be mixed, matched, and rebalanced in real time. In simpler words, NodeOps takes the chaos of decentralized infrastructure and makes it composable. “It’s how we move from fragmented workloads,” Kabra says, “to fluid compute economies.” While most infrastructure projects get stuck in “testnet,” NodeOps has been commercial since day one. In its very first week of 2025, the company pulled in $100,000 of revenue. “In a market flooded with speculative narratives, revenue is the strongest form of proof,” Kabra adds. “If your infra isn’t generating revenue, it’s just a hobby project with a Discord.” AI as the Secret Sauce At NodeOps, AI is the operating system. Co-founder and CEO Naman Kabra lights up as he explains how deeply integrated it is into their infrastructure. AI dynamically matches workloads to nodes, enforces SLAs, detects anomalies, and auto-scales deployments. Their Security Hub scans thousands of repositories in real time, while systems like NodeWatcher and NodeScore analyze telemetry from over 60,000 nodes to optimize performance on the fly. The result is infrastructure that’s not only self-healing but also economically provable. “You can buy servers,” Kabra adds. “You can’t buy orchestration that reasons.” In a space crowded with hardware, that kind of intelligence is more than a feature, it’s the moat. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long Term Success No DePIN project is complete without a token. However, Kabra shares that $NODE is not “just another governance token.” Users burn it to access compute credits. Providers stake it to earn, and bond it to commit. Emissions aren’t arbitrary; they only happen when real revenue is generated.Every machine on the network requires a base bond of 2,000 $NODE plus 200 per Compute Unit. Pair that with AVS, restaking, and slashing, and you get skin-in-the-game incentives that keep providers honest. And unlike most projects where token supply balloons regardless of demand, NodeOps uses a dynamic mint-and-burn model tied directly to daily on-chain revenue. “If revenue rises, tokens mint. If revenue slows, burn dominates. That’s how you kill inflation before it starts,” Kabra explains. NodeOps has just taken a big step, burning over $2.2 million worth of $NODE tokens, more than 20 million tokens, which is about 3% of the total supply. This irreversible, onchain burn reduces the circulating supply by 18%, marking the launch of their Dynamic Mint & Burn model. By tying token burns directly to network revenue, NodeOps aims to create a more sustainable and transparent ecosystem, giving $NODE holders real long-term value backed by code, not just promises.

NodeOps, under the guidance of its Co-founder and CEO Naman Kabra, is pioneering a solution to these challenges, aiming to redefine how infrastructure supports decentralized applications. The company, which boasts a network of over 700,000 users managing assets worth more than $150 million, not only supports enormous scale but also exemplifies profitability with over $4.1 million in revenue . NodeOps ranks among the top ten DePIN projects globally, based on revenue growth. The Role of AI in Web3 Infrastructure NodeOps differentiates itself by leveraging artificial intelligence to manage the lifecycle of decentralized compute resources. This includes everything from discovery and deployment to scaling and monitoring. The AI systems efficiently handle thousands of different nodes, ensuring optimal performance and security with minimal human intervention. ""AI is not just part of our infrastructure; it is the backbone,"" says Kabra. This advanced technology allows NodeOps to offer seamless and automatic orchestration of decentralized services, which Kabra believes is crucial for the future of Web3. Building a Sustainable Economic Model At the heart of NodeOps' economic strategy is the $NODE token, which integrates unique mechanisms such as burning to access compute credits and staking for earnings. This is complemented by a rigorous bonding system ensuring commitment from service providers, thereby securing the network's integrity and performance. Recently, NodeOps announced a significant token burn event, where over $2.2 million worth of $NODE tokens were eliminated from circulation. This act not only underscores their commitment to a stable token economy but also aligns token supply directly with actual network revenue, promoting long-term value for token holders. Read more about their strategy on their official blog . From Concept to Market Leader Unlike many infrastructure projects that remain in perpetual test phases, NodeOps has been commercially active from its inception. In its first operational week of 2025 alone, the platform generated $100,000 in revenue. ""Direct revenue generation from the start has been our proof of concept,"" Kabra remarks, highlighting the practical and immediate utility of NodeOps in the competitive market of decentralized networks. Future Prospects and Innovations Looking forward, Kabra is enthusiastic about expanding NodeOps's capabilities. The focus will remain on enhancing AI functionalities to further automate and secure decentralized operations, thus supporting more complex and diverse applications across the Web3 ecosystem.

As far as Lee is concerned, cryptocurrencies are too volatile and lack intrinsic value, even though they continue to attract the country’s youth. The growing movement has the nominee worried they they don’t know what they are getting into. FSC nominee is skeptical of crypto Lee’s official statement regarding virtual assets has concerned many in the industry, as they worry it means the government’s current position on crypto having no intrinsic value will persist, leading to continued regulatory policies. Continued regulatory action does not encourage innovation, and some are concerned that this will affect Korea’s standing globally. “They have different characteristics from traditional financial products such as deposits and securities in that they have no intrinsic value,” Lee stated in a written response to the National Assembly’s Political Affairs Committee regarding virtual assets. “Since virtual assets are subject to high price volatility, it is difficult to view them as fulfilling the essential functions of currency, such as storing value and serving as a means of exchange,” he added, effectively upholding the government’s current position on virtual assets. Further into his statements, he also made it clear he has taken a somewhat negative stance on specific policies related to virtual assets. For example, he highlighted concerns regarding virtual asset investment in pension and retirement accounts. Regarding the approval of a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), he said, “I understand that there are various expectations and concerns about the impact of introducing a Bitcoin spot ETF,” and “We will comprehensively consider global regulatory trends to establish the method of introduction, schedule, etc., and discuss it with the National Assembly.” As for stablecoin regulation, he promised to create opportunities for innovation, but he would also provide sufficient supplementary measures. Response to Lee’s critical position Lee’s opinion is being criticized in the virtual asset industry as being overly cautious and behind the global trend. His statement on virtual assets having no intrinsic value specifically has ruffled many feathers and has been evaluated as inappropriate now that the world has woken up to the use cases of virtual assets. Local reports quoted an unspecified blockchain technology company official: “The argument that there’s no intrinsic value is inappropriate at a time when large U.S. and global corporations are using virtual assets as strategic reserves.” He added, “Virtual assets like Bitcoin possess digital utility, such as security and transferability, built on blockchain networks.” The official also strongly criticized Lee’s position that “Bitcoin has no intrinsic value even if it reaches 1 billion won,” asking, “Who will take responsibility for the opportunity costs of domestic investors and the industrial ecosystem that is flowing out of the country?” It has become apparent to industry leaders in the country that they need to become aggressive in steering regulation, as is the case in America. “If we view virtual assets as a type of stock, the calculation leads to the conclusion that they have no intrinsic value. We must discard this prejudice and begin fostering the industry with a new perspective,” another official said. Some have even argued that a separate organization for virtual assets needs to be established, citing how the Financial Services Commission , with its responsibility for virtual asset policy, has been overly focused on regulation rather than fostering innovation within the industry.

The token, currently in Phase 6 of its presale, has climbed from its opening price of $0.01 to $0.035, representing a 250% increase. At this stage, $15,220,000 has already been raised and total holders stand at 15,880. Phase 6 is selling out fast, leaving investors with a narrowing window before the shift to Phase 7, which will lift the price to $0.04. After the presale, MUTM will be launched at $0.06, which will give buyers today an estimated reward of 300% to 500%. Mutuum Finance Presale Progress Momentum has been accelerating as the presale advances, and demand is showing no signs of slowing down. Investors are positioning early because they recognize the token’s strong fundamentals. Phase 6 at $0.035 marks one of the last low-cost entry points before price progression moves higher. The next stage promises a 14.3% rise, and given how quickly each stage is filling, the opportunity to secure MUTM at this level is quickly ending. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has successfully completed a successful Certik audit with a 95.00 security score. No vulnerabilities were reported, and the project has remained incident-free for the last 90 days. To strengthen its security stance further, Mutuum Finance has introduced a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program with rewards spread across severity levels from critical to low. Moreover, the project has launched a dashboard featuring a leaderboard for the top 50 holders, offering bonus token rewards for long-term commitment. Adding to community growth is a headline $100,000 giveaway , split across 10 winners who will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM. This initiative, combined with presale growth, is fueling excitement around the project. Lending Innovation and Use Case Mutuum Finance is developing a two-way lending platform that combines peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract lending, which fills a severe gap in decentralized finance. The model is designed to enhance capital efficiency, offering reliable yields for lenders while expanding borrowing options. In addition, an overcollateralized stablecoin system will operate on a mint-and-burn framework to maintain stability and prevent inflation. Cost efficiency is another advantage as Mutuum Finance is integrating a Layer 2 solution. Lower transaction fees and faster speeds mean broader accessibility for users, strengthening token activity and encouraging wider adoption. Price Prediction Compared To Dogecoin The price prediction for Mutuum Finance breaking $0.50 in 2025 is supported by historical evidence from other crypto coins. Dogecoin in 2020 traded as low as $0.0025 before reaching $0.74 in May 2021. That jump occurred in less than 18 months, representing an extraordinary return of nearly 30,000%. Investors who acted early in Dogecoin’s rise witnessed an outcome few predicted, as demand and community support propelled the token to mainstream recognition. Mutuum Finance is demonstrating similar dynamics but with stronger fundamentals. Its utility-driven ecosystem, coupled with presale momentum and secured audits, sets the stage for a meaningful surge. If MUTM continues building demand, surpassing $0.50 in 2025 could be realistic. At that level, early buyers at $0.035 would be positioned for outsized gains, though unlike Dogecoin, MUTM’s growth is tied to lending infrastructure and a disciplined stablecoin model. Looking Ahead At MUTM’s Momentum Mutuum Finance has been progressing through presale phases with increasing pace, backed by both technical strength and community participation. If the presale trajectory and adoption continue aligning, breaking $0.50 in 2025 does not appear speculative but achievable. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming one of the best cryptos to purchase currently, to investors seeking what crypto to invest in. Its presale framework, scarcity of tokens, and powerful use case make it a project that can compete with past explosive narratives.

This helped the platform secure the top position among Solana-based launchpads. However, most traders lost money, with research shared by Defioasis showing that total losses reached $66 million during the month. PumpFun Reclaims Top Spot in Solana Launchpad Market As shared in a recent X post , about 1.35 million addresses took part in trading on Pump.Fun, and 595,000 new tokens were launched on the platform. With this level of activity, Pump.Fun overtook its rivals once again. Records from Jupiter confirmed that PumpFun captured 46.6% of the Solana launchpad market. In comparison, its closest competitor which saw brief momentum, LetsBonk, managed under 9% of market share with $97.8 million in activity. Data from Dune also showed that PUMP tokens are now held by more than 71,000 wallets. Smaller holders are playing an important role, with 46% of the tokens owned by wallets with fewer than 1,000 tokens. Traders’ Losses on Pump.Fun Outnumber Profits Despite the busy trading activity, losses incurred on Pump.Fun were high. Over 60% of all traders ended the month with losses, totally $66 million. Reportedly, no wallet earned more than $1 million in profits. The biggest group of losing traders were smaller investors. Around 882,000 wallets, or 65.4% of all active addresses, recorded losses between $0 and $1,000. On the other hand, profits were modest. About 416,000 wallets made small gains of under $1,000, with an average of just below $100. Around 18,000 wallets earned between $1,000 and $10,000. Only 1,665 addresses achieved profits above $10,000. Buybacks and Revenue Growth Amid Rising Legal Pressure To support its token, Pump.Fun has been buying back PUMP . In August, it spent $58.7 million, bringing total buybacks to $66.6 million. So far, over 17.5 billion tokens have been repurchased at an average price of $0.0038. PumpFun’s growth can also be seen in its earnings . Since August 6, the platform has been making over $1 million in revenue every day, with trading volumes reaching as high as $210 million in a single day. The platform also charges a 1% fee on each token trade. This has allowed it to collect more than $800 million in lifetime fees, making PumpFun one of the most profitable platforms in the Solana ecosystem. However, despite this growth, Pump.Fun is still facing legal challenges. A class-action lawsuit filed earlier this year claimed that the Pump.Fun operates like an unlicensed casino. The lawsuit also compared its token system to a rigged slot machine. In the updated filing from July, plaintiffs said that total investor losses linked to the platform have already reached $5.5 billion.

The pullback comes amid profit-taking after ETF-driven rallies, weakening technical signals, and a broader shift toward risk-off sentiment in crypto markets. With Bitcoin dominance climbing to above 57, altcoins like XRP are losing momentum as traders rotate into perceived safer large-cap assets. ETF Speculation Cools the Rally Optimism around spot XRP and Solana ETFs drove much of the asset’s 2025 surge, but momentum has cooled. While Bloomberg analysts assign a 95% probability of approval by October, skepticism lingers about whether XRP can attract significant institutional demand. Unlike Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem or Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative, XRP lacks a strong “institutional use case” to anchor inflows. The SEC currently faces 92 pending crypto ETF applications (Bitrue data), raising the risk of dilution. Even if XRP ETFs are approved, not all products may attract meaningful capital. What this means: Traders question whether much of the upside from ETF approvals has already been priced in. This reassessment has fueled profit-taking after XRP’s 400% yearly gain. Technical Weakness From a chart perspective, XRP has entered a fragile phase. It broke below the 30-day SMA ($3.03) and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level ($3.23), reinforcing bearish bias. Source: coinmarketcap The technicals are following: RSI-14: 40.55, nearing oversold but not yet at reversal levels. MACD histogram: -0.0278, confirming bearish momentum. Support zone: $2.75–$2.88, combining the 78.6% Fib retracement with the August 29 low. A close below $2.75 could trigger stops that send prices toward $2.50, though the 200-day EMA ($2.48) may cushion deeper downside. Adding to the pressure, 24h trading volume stands at $6.6B, down 43% compared to July peaks, suggesting conviction behind recent moves is weakening. Altcoin Sentiment Fades Away Macro headwinds are amplifying rotation into Bitcoin. With the VIX volatility index up 12% this week, traders are favoring large caps over speculative altcoins. The Altcoin Season Index fell to 48/100, underscoring this shift. XRP’s underperformance — a 1.4% drop versus BTC (-0.9%) and ETH (-1.1%) — highlights the pressure. Its market dominance at 4.36% could erode further if Bitcoin tests the $150K resistance in the near term. Without a near-term catalyst, XRP risks lagging as capital concentrates in Bitcoin during periods of uncertainty. Outset PR: Clarity in Times of Uncertainty As XRP traders await regulatory clarity and fight shifting market sentiment, crypto projects face a parallel challenge: navigating uncertainty with precision and visibility. That is where Outset PR , founded by renowned strategist Mike Ermolaev, makes its mark. Instead of mass-blast outreach or cookie-cutter placements, Outset PR builds campaigns like a workshop, carefully weaving a client’s story into the market context. Every element is data-driven: media outlets are chosen by discoverability, domain authority, and viral potential; pitches are tailored to each platform’s voice and audience; timing is mapped to let narratives build trust organically. Outset PR’s exclusive traffic acquisition technology blends organic editorial exposure with SEO and lead generation, helping clients achieve multiples more traffic than conventional PR methods.

Digital assets are expected to tap the industry’s $2.8 trillion in total value, as mainstream crypto adoption is gaining mainstream acceptance. Coinbase Global and OKX are preparing products to tap the Australian pension pool, containing $2.8 trillion in one of the world’s best-regulated retirement systems. Two of the largest centralized exchanges aim to redirect some of the retirement money into cryptocurrencies, deepening the connection between crypto and mainstream finance. The initial connection with crypto will be the newly introduced superannuation funds, or SMSFs, which make up around 25% of Australia’s pension pool. The funds rely on self-selected investments, giving individuals decision-making power over their retirement portfolio. Regular Australian pension pools have avoided crypto so far, with no sign of adopting those assets anytime soon. ‘It does make sense that we’re probably seeing a bit more interest in crypto in the self-managed super fund space first,’ said Fabian Bussoletti, technical manager at the SMSF Association, cited by Bloomberg. ‘Perhaps the larger funds will catch up over time.’ Crypto adoption in pensions is still in its initial stages, though UK investors have taken up the potential of digital assets, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier . To tap the Australian market, Coinbase will launch a dedicated SMSF service, which already has 500 investors on its waiting list. OKX launched a similar point of access in June, also showing significant demand, said Kate Cooper, chief executive of the OKX Australian arm. Crypto holdings for retirement remain modest Crypto holdings in SMSF remain relatively low, the equivalent of $1.1B, based on Australian tax office data . However, Australian investors have expanded their holdings significantly since the initial forays in 2021. Both Coinbase and OKX expect asset acquisition will expand, as institutional funds and regulators become more comfortable with crypto exposure. As of 2025, AMP is the only major Australian pension provider with crypto-based exposure. The Coinbase and OKX products are tailored to buy-and-hold investors, rather than active traders. The exchanges will help investors to establish their own SMSF, with legal and accounting help. Establishing an SMSF has significant administrative costs, including independent audits, so the crypto investment may only be viable for larger accounts. Coinbase expects clients with up to $65K investments Coinbase has been preparing for SMSF services since 2024 and will roll out the full product in the coming months. The potential clients from the waiting list show an 80% probability of establishing a new SMSF, while 77% plan to invest up to $65,000 (A$100,000) in digital assets. Coinbase’s approach aims to tap newer generations of investors, who are often crypto natives and more comfortable with picking their own investments. Younger investors open SMSF years earlier than previous generations and allocate more to digital assets. The Australian Securities and Investment Commission still urges caution and avoiding over-exposure due to volatility. Australia’s regulators are also vigilant about crypto crime, recently ordering Binance Holdings, Ltd. to appoint an external auditor on its local arm. Australia overhauled its crypto regulation framework earlier in 2025 , though it still retains the momentum as one of the global crypto hotspots. Both Coinbase and OKX have attempted to stay within the boundaries of current crypto regulations, as it would allow them to tap into inflows from the much more liquid traditional markets.

With institutional momentum—highlighted by BlackRock’s push—ETH is showing the kind of strength that could set up a decisive breakout above $5,000. Market watchers are eyeing September as a potential turning point where Ethereum could not only test resistance but also carve a path toward new highs. Ethereum on the Rise: Potential Breakthrough Above $5000 Source: tradingview Ethereum (ETH) currently trades between $4168 and $4710, experiencing a slight dip of almost 9% over the past week. However, its growth over the last six months shows a remarkable gain of over 100%, hinting at strong upward momentum. Analysts point to the nearest resistance level of $5026, suggesting that if ETH can surpass this, it may aim for the next target at $5567. A move to this point would represent an impressive rise from current levels, nearly hitting a 20% increase. While the short-term signals show some slowdown, the broader outlook remains optimistic for Ethereum's continued growth. Conclusion Ethereum’s trajectory remains firmly bullish, with strong fundamentals and institutional backing fueling investor confidence. A clean break above $5,026 could pave the way toward $5,567, marking another milestone in ETH’s long-term growth story. As September unfolds, Ethereum looks poised to be one of the market’s most closely watched assets—potentially leading the next wave of crypto momentum.

Criticism has been exchanged, sparking a fierce debate on which coin holds the most promise. Enthusiasts and investors are keen to see which digital currency emerges victorious in this battle for market dominance. Discover which coins are poised for significant growth. XRP Price Shows Potential for Growth Despite Recent Dips Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between a higher two-dollar and lower three-dollar range. The coin has recently dipped nearly nine percent in the past week and almost seven percent over the past month. However, its six-month performance shows a growth of over twelve percent. XRP is approaching the three-dollar resistance mark, with potential to climb over sixteen percent to the second resistance near three and a half dollars if upward momentum continues. Support rests in the lower two-dollar range, offering stability. The ten-day average keeps it slightly below current prices, hinting at cautious progress. With calculated moves, XRP could surprise with strong gains. Litecoin Gains Momentum: Will It Break Resistance Levels Soon? Source: tradingview Litecoin (LTC) is currently priced between one hundred four and one hundred sixteen dollars. The coin is trying to recover from a recent dip, showing a minor loss over the past week. However, it has gained more than two percent over the last month and over five percent in half a year. The next big test for Litecoin comes at a resistance of one hundred twenty-three dollars. If it breaks this, it could aim for the one thirty-four mark, a potential increase of about fifteen percent from current prices. Such a movement would signal growing strength, but traders should watch its RSI and MACD indicators closely. Litecoin's immediate support rests near one hundred dollars, a crucial level to hold. Conclusion The competition between XRP and Litecoin continues to heat up. XRP is praised for its speed and partnerships in the financial sector. Meanwhile, Litecoin stands out with its longevity and active development. Both coins have strengths that appeal to different investor groups. The market battle will likely depend on future technological advancements and adoption rates. Neither coin is definitively better, as each serves distinct purposes. The outcome remains open as both strive to capture more market attention and utility. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The move marks the latest pivot for the Tokyo-based company, once a struggling hotel operator, now one of the world’s largest corporate holders of the cryptocurrency. Metaplanet shareholders approved a plan on Monday to issue 550 million new shares, raising about 130.3 billion yen ($884 million) as the company seeks fresh capital to expand its Bitcoin holdings.

The plan was proposed last Wednesday. The event drew an unusually festive crowd, complete with food trucks, a K-pop performance, and a high-profile appearance by Eric Trump . Trump, who joined Metaplanet’s board of advisers in March, appeared on stage with founder and CEO Simon Gerovich. He praised Gerovich as “one of the most honest people I’ve ever met” and reiterated his view of Bitcoin as “the ultimate global asset.” Eric Trump’s Monday meeting in Tokyo will involve a vote by Metaplanet shareholders on a capital-raising proposal. https://t.co/nofFwD4hlp — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 1, 2025 Trump also disclosed that the Trump Organization holds Bitcoin and claimed that sovereign wealth funds and world leaders are now moving to accumulate the token. He recently spoke at the Bitcoin Asia conference in Hong Kong. Metaplanet announced that it added 1,009 Bitcoin on Monday , bringing its total to 20,000 coins worth more than $2 billion. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, the purchase makes the Tokyo-based firm the sixth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder. @Metaplanet_JP just stacked 1,009 more Bitcoin, boosting its treasure chest to 20,000 BTC, now valued at about $2.14B. #Metaplanet #HODL https://t.co/oD1HCMenYY — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 1, 2025 Bitcoin Premium Compression Threatens Metaplanet’s Accumulation Strategy The expansion comes as Metaplanet faces pressure on its financing strategy. Gerovich, a former Goldman Sachs derivatives trader, has relied on “moving strike warrants” issued to Evo Fund to generate cash for Bitcoin purchases. The approach, which Gerovich dubbed the “flywheel,” allowed the company to raise funds at low cost while its stock was climbing. Additionally, the model has faltered as shares retreated. After soaring more than 740% over the past year, Metaplanet’s stock has fallen 54% since peaking in mid-June, even as Bitcoin has risen 2% in the same period. The slowdown has curbed accumulation, with Bitcoin holdings growing by 160% in the two months through June but less than 50% since. “The flywheel has slowed,” said Mark Chadwick , a former Jefferies analyst cited by Bloomberg. “As the stock declines, each exercise generates less capital to buy Bitcoin.” The analysts also note the compression of Metaplanet’s so-called “Bitcoin premium”—the difference between the company’s market capitalization and the value of its holdings. Once at more than eight times its Bitcoin reserves in June, the multiple has narrowed to roughly two. “The Bitcoin premium is what drives the success of the entire strategy,” said Natixis analyst Eric Benoist. “If the premium compresses, they can’t accumulate on the same terms, interest wanes, and the stock goes down.” To ease the strain, in addition to the $884 million overseas share sale, Metaplanet previously proposed issuing up to 555 million preferred shares, potentially raising as much as ¥555 billion ($3.8 billion) . Metaplanet raised over $517M on day one of its “555 Million Plan,” signaling strong early backing for its bold Bitcoin accumulation strategy. #Metaplanet #BTC https://t.co/NJ87Y5eP22 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 25, 2025 The securities would carry dividends of up to 6% and be capped at 25% of the value of the company’s Bitcoin holdings. While preferred shares typically lack voting rights, they offer dividend priority over common stock, an attractive feature for Japanese investors in a low-rate environment. Gerovich has called the preferred issuance a “defensive mechanism,” designed to protect common shareholders from dilution if the stock trades closer to the value of its Bitcoin reserves. The company also suspended the exercise of Evo Fund’s warrants through September to prepare for the move. “We don’t want to fall behind—people are racing to buy Bitcoin,” Gerovich said. “I want another tool in my toolkit.” Bitcoin traded at $108,046 on Monday, down from last month’s record of $124,481, though Eric Trump insisted prices would eventually climb to $1 million. Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Pass $111B as Metaplanet Leads in Asia Metaplanet Inc. has cemented its position as Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, reporting a 468% yield in the second quarter of 2025 as its treasury reached 18,113 BTC worth $2.1 billion. The Tokyo-listed firm formally adopted Bitcoin treasury operations in December 2024 and has since pivoted fully from hotel management to digital assets under Gerovich. The company’s rapid accumulation strategy has drawn comparisons to Strategy, which developed the corporate Bitcoin reserve model in the U.S. Metaplanet’s “555 Million Plan” targets 210,000 BTC , about 1% of the total supply, by 2027. In the near term, it plans to more than quadruple holdings to 100,000 BTC by the end of next year. Japan's @Metaplanet_JP Q2 financial report shows a 468% Bitcoin yield, becoming the 4th largest global holder with 18,113 BTC worth $2.1B, targeting 210,000 BTC by 2027. #Japan #Bitcoin https://t.co/n5xJXwpgW7 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 13, 2025 The firm reported ¥816 million in operating profit on ¥1,239 million in Q2 revenue, largely driven by ¥1,131 million in income from Bitcoin option underwriting. The number of shareholders has surged more than 1,000% in a year to 128,000, making Metaplanet the best performer among 55,000 publicly listed firms in 2024. Globally, more than 170 companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, totaling over $111 billion. Still, analysts warn that the strategy carries risks of dilution when stock values converge with Bitcoin’s net asset value.

51027976,570690,1756749614,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51027976.jpeg,"Bitcoin OG Sells 2,000 BTC To Buy Ethereum – Capital Rotation Accelerates",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-og-sells-2000-buy-ethereum-capital-rotation/,"Ethereum is once again in the spotlight as institutional demand and whale accumulation continue to shape the market, even in the face of a recent correction. Despite price retracements that have introduced uncertainty, the broader trend reveals that large investors are steadily rotating capital into ETH. Headlines about whales moving significant amounts of funds to accumulate Ethereum have dominated the news cycle, reinforcing the view that ETH remains a cornerstone asset for the next phase of the market. One of the most notable players driving this trend is a massive Bitcoin OG wallet that has repeatedly caught analysts’ attention. According to Lookonchain, this whale has sold another 2,000 BTC, worth approximately $215 million, and immediately purchased 48,942 ETH ($215M) spot over the past four hours. This aggressive move adds to an already substantial position, reflecting a decisive capital rotation strategy away from Bitcoin and into Ethereum. Such transactions highlight the growing confidence among whales and institutions in Ethereum’s long-term value, particularly as network activity and adoption remain robust. While short-term volatility continues, these large-scale moves point to a deeper underlying trend: Ethereum’s role as the leading alternative to Bitcoin is strengthening, and the market is preparing for the next stage. Whale Accumulation Sparks Ethereum Speculation According to Lookonchain, the Bitcoin OG investor has now accumulated an astonishing 886,371 ETH, valued at approximately $4.07 billion. This massive accumulation has quickly become one of the most discussed developments in the crypto market, sparking intense speculation about Ethereum’s trajectory in the months ahead. Many analysts view this as a clear case of “smart money positioning,” with whales and institutions increasingly treating Ethereum as the leading alternative to Bitcoin in the ongoing capital rotation. The scale of these purchases suggests more than simple speculation. Large players are signaling confidence in Ethereum’s long-term role, especially given its dominance in DeFi, stablecoins, and network activity. By staking much of these holdings, the whale also demonstrates conviction in Ethereum’s ability to generate yield while securing the network, further underscoring ETH’s utility beyond price speculation. However, risks remain. Bitcoin has struggled to maintain its uptrend, and uncertainty around its ability to recover momentum weighs heavily on the broader market. At the same time, several altcoins are facing steep corrections, highlighting the fragility of sentiment during this phase. Testing Support Amid Consolidation Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $4,414 after another failed attempt to break above the $4,500 resistance zone. The chart shows ETH stuck in a consolidation phase, with price action forming a sideways range since mid-August. Despite recent volatility, ETH remains above the 200-day SMA near $4,220, a critical support that continues to attract buyers during dips. The 50-day and 100-day SMAs, now clustered around $4,460, are acting as dynamic resistance, keeping upside momentum capped. Each rejection from this zone highlights market hesitation, as traders await confirmation of direction. If ETH holds above $4,400, a push back toward $4,600–$4,800 remains possible. However, a breakdown below $4,300 could trigger further downside toward the $4,200 support region. Momentum indicators suggest a cooling phase after Ethereum’s strong rally in July and early August.

Matt Hougan Says Institutions Sometimes Start With ETH,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-investment-over-bitcoin/,"Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has stated that a growing number of professional investors are skipping Bitcoin and turning directly to Ethereum as their first crypto investment. This has long been regarded as the entry point into digital assets, and Bitcoin is now sharing the spotlight with Ethereum. Ethereum Emerging As First Choice For Professional Investors In Ripdoteth’s update on X, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has revealed on live that an interesting trend is emerging. He claims that many professional investors are bypassing Bitcoin and going directly to Ethereum, whose utility in decentralized finance, smart contracts, and Web3 applications is increasingly drawing institutional capital. The reason he explains is rooted in how institutions already think about portfolio construction. Related Reading: You Know Bitmine Has Been Buying Ethereum, But Can You Believe How Much ETH The Company Now Holds? According to the expert, most professional investors don’t actually own gold. This is because Gold is considered a niche asset, with perhaps only 15% to 20% of institutions holding it, while the vast majority of 80% or more invest in stocks and bonds. Since Bitcoin is often framed as digital gold, its appeal is limited for many professionals who never allocated to gold in the first place. “A lot of people look at Bitcoin like it’s digital gold. I don’t own gold, but I do own technologies,” Hougan stated. ETH fits naturally into the portfolios of those who already allocate to innovative technologies. With tokenization and stablecoins gaining traction, he expects institutional flow into ETH to continue building momentum. ETH Hits All-Time Highs As Institutions Target Long-Term Holdings While institutions see Ethereum as the exposure to the technological backbone of a digital economy, Wall Street FOMO has hit historic levels, as the US institutional appetite for ETH is reaching unprecedented heights. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Whale Populations Quietly Growing, On-Chain Data Reveals Crypto trader Bull Theory has highlighted that in August 2025 alone, Ethereum Spot ETFs purchased $3.87 billion worth of ETH, driven almost entirely by professional investors chasing long-term exposure. Leading the charge is $11 trillion asset manager BlackRock, which allocated $3.38 billion worth of ETH and $707 million in Bitcoin, highlighting a clear preference for ETH over BTC. This wave of institutional buying pushed Ethereum to new all-time highs in August. Importantly, the majority of these purchases are intended for long-term holdings, reducing immediate sell pressure and supporting sustained price momentum. If ETH closes above $4,630, it will mark the highest monthly close since the 2021 bull run. Furthermore, Ethereum’s transaction volumes surged past $320 billion on-chain, reflecting broad engagement across decentralized finance, stablecoins, and tokenized assets. Meanwhile, staking continues to attract Wall Street attention, with nearly 36 million ETH, which is 29% of the total circulating supply, now locked in staking contracts. With 3% staking rewards, Ethereum provides institutional investors with a steady dividend, making it more appealing for long-term portfolios.

However, recent on-chain indicators suggest that underlying market strength remains intact despite recent bouts of volatility. Bitcoin’s Next Leg Up One key indicator, Delta Cap, currently stands at $739.4 billion, with a corresponding price of $108.9K. Derived from the difference between Realized Cap and Average Cap, Delta Cap has historically functioned as a long-term valuation floor during major market cycles. With BTC trading comfortably above this steadily rising line, analysts at CryptoQuant point to signs of strong capital inflows and renewed conviction among long-term investors, even as short-term spot prices face corrections. Meanwhile, institutional demand appears to be accelerating. The Coinbase Premium Gap, which measures the price difference between US exchange Coinbase and global counterpart Binance, currently reflects a positive spread of +11.6. This premium means that US institutions are willing to pay more for Bitcoin exposure, a trend that in past cycles has led to extended bullish moves as institutional buying pressure drives price discovery. Together, these indicators depict a constructive market setup: Bitcoin consolidating above the $100K threshold with both institutional support and a steadily climbing valuation base. Rather than signaling weakness, current corrections may represent opportunities for accumulation within a strong structural uptrend. Analyst Rekt Fencer also pushed back against the prevailing September gloom as he tweeted that a major Bitcoin dump is unlikely this time around. According to him, BTC has already “front-ran” the seasonal sell-off, which means that recent August weakness effectively priced in the downside risk. Drawing parallels to 2017, he noted that the market followed a similar trajectory back then, where early corrections shook out bearish sentiment before a strong rally took hold. Fencer argues that history may be repeating itself, with bears once again misjudging the setup and potentially missing the next upward move. Perfect Storm for Rally Analysts have recently weighed down on the slowdown and observed that this period could be setting the stage for a much larger rally in fall 2025. Long-term holding patterns, for one, indicate that the BTC market is in Phase 3 of its cycle, which tends to feature lengthening uptrends and softer corrections compared to earlier phases. This cycle has been shaped by new factors, including spot ETFs, rising institutional involvement, and even government-level adoption. At the same time, capital rotation into altcoins has periodically slowed Bitcoin’s momentum, a trend seen more prominently now than during the 2023-2024 run. Still, macro catalysts remain favorable: a potential September rate cut and possible approval of altcoin ETFs in October could provide renewed fuel.

Here Are His Reasons,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-says-xrp-is-about-to-go-nuclear-here-are-his-reasons/,"CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii), a well-known crypto commentator, recently shared insights on XRP’s potential trajectory, tying it to a major financial shift highlighted by Forbes. The report he referenced projects that around $84 trillion held by baby boomers will transfer to younger generations over the next two decades. According to him, this demographic shift is significant because younger investors are more inclined toward cryptocurrencies than traditional equities. As this wealth moves, he suggested a large portion may enter digital assets, such as XRP. He emphasized that institutional adoption is equally important. With Wall Street firms such as BlackRock already leading the way through Bitcoin ETFs, the precedent could set the stage for regulated XRP investment vehicles. These developments, he argued, may accelerate the transition from a speculation-driven market to one fueled by utility. YOU ARE NOT PREPARED! $XRP Is About to go Nuclear Because of This.. pic.twitter.com/tghsSd3TqC — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) September 1, 2025 Institutional Demand and Exchange Liquidity One of the key points raised was the growing institutional appetite for spot XRP products. Citing industry reports, he noted that XRP reserves on exchanges are at multi-year lows, with only 1.5 to 3.5 billion tokens available. said the importance of this figure, as demand from exchange-traded products would require direct purchases from the open market, potentially straining already limited supply. He also drew attention to comments made by Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, who forecasted that an XRP ETF could attract as much as $8 billion in inflows . CryptoSensei highlighted the implications of such demand, suggesting it could have an outsized effect on XRP’s valuation given the thin liquidity on exchanges. Strategic Investments and Global Positioning Beyond ETFs, CryptoSensei described corporate activity as evidence of XRP’s strengthening role in global finance. He highlighted Gumi, a Japanese gaming company, which announced a $17 million XRP purchase , a figure nearly three times larger than its Bitcoin allocation. He highlighted South Korea’s role, where investors hold about 25% of XRP’s circulating supply, valued at $29 billion, noting Ripple’s sponsorship of the upcoming XRP Seoul 2025 conference as evidence of its growing presence in Asia . Long-Term Outlook CryptoSensei argued that Ripple’s alignment with ISO 20022, also adopted by SWIFT, positions XRP as a bank-compatible asset for global payments. He said Ripple’s acquisitions, such as its stake in Hidden Road, are part of a strategy to drive real utility. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He also pointed to SBI Holdings, noting the firm’s continued promotion of XRP as evidence that major institutions remain committed to its ecosystem. While acknowledging recent price declines, he kept focus on the long-term outlook. For him, the decisive factor is whether ETF inflows and institutional adoption materialize at scale, potentially pushing XRP into a new growth phase.

Delegates from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies have sent mixed signals. The group has already restored 2.2 million barrels daily, a year earlier than planned. Demand is steady, but the International Energy Agency still sees a sizable surplus by year-end. Prices are down about 9% this year as the OPEC+ ramp-up collides with slower Chinese fuel use and rising flows from the United States, Brazil and Canada. Brent traded near $68 a barrel on Monday, pressuring producers globally. It is a win for President Donald Trump, who pushes for cheaper fuel, but threatens producers’ revenue. “I expect OPEC+ to hold fire through the current refinery maintenance season to assess if the widely expected downside to crude prices will materialize,” said Aldo Spanjer, head of energy strategy at BNP Paribas. Officials say the recent surge aimed to reclaim market share lost during years of cuts. Another 1.66 million barrels a day of capacity is due to stay offline until the end of next year. Even so, most traders and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg do not expect an immediate restart. Seventeen respondents predicted OPEC+ will keep output flat in October when ministers meet by video on Sunday (Sept. 7), while six expected a modest increase. Next OPEC+ move could be a cut or further hike At last month’s meeting, eight key members approved a September rise of 547,000 barrels a day, completing the return of 2.2 million barrels a day shut in during 2023. Officials also signaled the next move could be a cut or another increase. “The phase-out of the additional voluntary production adjustments may be paused or reversed subject to evolving market conditions,” the producers said on OPEC’s website. Some analysts, including Martijn Rats at Morgan Stanley, say OPEC+ may need to cut output next year to avoid a glut. Prices rose more than 1% on Monday on worries over Russia-Ukraine airstrikes and a weaker dollar. At 1335 GMT, Brent traded at $68.28 per barrel, up $0.80 (1.2%). In the U.S., West Texas Intermediate rose by $0.80 (1.3%) to $64.81. Trading was muted by a U.S. public holiday. Brent and WTI posted their first monthly declines in four months in August, losing 6% or more on extra OPEC+ supply. “Crude fell in August and has started September with no clear direction within established ranges as fears of a fourth-quarter supply glut are offset by geopolitical tensions,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. He said attention had shifted to Beijing, where China’s Xi Jinping, Russia’s Vladimir Putin, and India’s Narendra Modi are attending a regional summit. He added that the OPEC+ meeting on September 7 was also in focus. Markets remain wary of Russian flows Weekly shipments from its ports fell to a four-week low of 2.72 million barrels per day, ANZ said, citing tanker-tracker data. On Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy vowed to answer with more strikes deep inside Russia after Russian drones hit power facilities in northern and southern Ukraine. Both sides have intensified airstrikes, hitting energy sites and disrupting Russian exports. HSBC analysts said oil inventories should rise in the last quarter of 2025 and the first quarter of 2026, with a surplus of 1.6 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter. The U.S. labor-market report this week will show the economy’s health and test investor confidence that interest-rate cuts are coming soon. Before the data, the dollar was near a five-week low on Monday, making oil cheaper for other buyers. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

But both analysts and ChatGPT 5 are staying cool, predicting a bullish long-term outlook, especially for XRP with its expanding real-world use, Avalanche with its growing ecosystem, and Dogecoin still riding that classic meme hype. Ethereum just ripped to a new ATH at $4,950, reminding everyone it’s still the altcoin leader. That breakout gave ETH-based meme coins like DOGE a serious boost, and the whole alt scene pumped too before easing off. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is sitting at $108K—about 10% under its $124K August peak. Even so, sentiment leans bullish thanks to the friendliest regulatory environment we’ve seen yet, and ChatGPT predicts matches that vibe. XRP (Ripple): ChatGPT Sees Explosive Year-End Rally—Could the Run Start in September? 2025 has been XRP’s breakout year. It finally beat the SEC case, broke past a dollar, and ripped 400% over the year. ChatGPT predicts the rally is still alive and will be going again. Adoption’s kicking in harder with more people jumping on the network. The XRP Mastercard just dropped , sliding straight into the credit card game. An October ETF looks like it’s coming, stacking even more hype. A senior Coinbase analyst said if the Fed starts easing, risk money will flood back into crypto, and XRP is set to shine. With its cross-border payment edge and steady compliance moves, it’s lining up as a prime investment pick. Source: XRPUSD / TradingView While long-term still looks bullish, September is a historically weak month for the crypto market. Although an expectation is set for XRP to hit over $5, traders must remain cautious. Momentum’s still shaky. RSI sitting at 39 shows weak demand, and MACD’s hanging just under neutral. Candles are printing spinning tops right at resistance, usually hinting a breakout’s getting close. The potential move toward $10 is clear in the long term, but it needs to break resistance at $3.66 first, a level the price was rejected from, before dipping under $3 again. Avalanche (AVAX): No More Boredom? ChatGPT Says $50 In Play Avalanche has been one of the most underwhelming and boring altcoins this past year, with barely any hype and no big wins. But that’s starting to change. Grayscale just filed for an AVAX ETF on Nasdaq, with October shaping up as the key decision month alongside 90+ other ETF rulings . On top of that, Avalanche struck a deal with the U.S. Commerce Department to put GDP data on-chain , and they’ve already run their first AVAX transaction. Since late July, AVAX has been building higher lows, showing buyers keep stepping in stronger every dip. A breakout over key resistance could spark a run back to December’s highs near $52, lining up a short-term 120% move. For now, volume’s cooling off as AVAX retests its trend line support. ChatGPT’s $300 call sounds wild, but with the Grayscale ETF launch coming, AVAX might just be lining up for that path. Dogecoin (DOGE): Memecoin’s Main Player Set for $1, ChatGPT Predicts Everyone loves memes and memecoins, right? ChatGPT, too, is calling for a roughly 66% higher price for Dogecoin (DOGE) by the end of 2025. That outlook lines up with Grayscale’s surprise move—filing the first-ever Dogecoin ETF, the first memecoin to get that spotlight. No wonder they chose DOGE, the OG of the meme world. October is looking bullish for altcoins, with the Dogecoin ETF decision landing then. Bloomberg says most of these ETF filings carry an 85%+ chance at approval , so a memecoin ETF could really shake things up for memecoins. Kaleo’s breakout shows up on the DOGE/USDT chart too. The bullish sign? Price retested the top of that descending triangle from above and bounced right off it. Dogecoin’s chart has been stuck in consolidation, sitting above the $0.20 support. It’s trading near $0.21 now after finally breaking out of that long falling channel. The real test sits up at $0.30—that resistance has to flip before any explosive move toward $2.00 Chatgpt predicts can kick in. If DOGE can turn $0.30–$0.35 into support, the door to $1 swings open. RSI’s sitting at 49, pretty neutral, while MACD’s a bit negative, but nothing scary. Analysts are eyeing a breakout soon, and that could spark a wider memecoin rally. And what usually pumps the hardest in these rallies? New launches with strong communities backing them. Maxi Doge is the perfect example. It’s running the same playbook Dogecoin used to do, and it’s still early days for fresh investors to slide in. Maxi Doge: ChatGPT No. 1 Memecoin—100× Potential? Maxi Doge’s stealing the spotlight right now. Fresh out of presale, this Dogecoin-inspired meme token already racked up over $1.73 million. It’s fully leaning into meme culture, built around a jacked “gym bro” Doge obsessed with high-leverage trading—no fake utility narrative here. Still, it’s not all jokes. Maxi Doge has staking and contests built in to keep the community hyped and engaged for the long haul. The best part? Token distribution. Around 40% of supply went to the public presale, with zero insider or private allocations, meaning way less risk of whales dumping once it hits the big exchanges. They’re also rolling out a staking program for MAXI holders, giving presale buyers the chance to earn up to 178 % annual yield. So, you can lock up your MAXI and start racking up rewards even before the presale ends. Early believers might cash in big and end up making the most of it. Head to the Maxi Doge website to follow smart investors and join the presale. You can make your purchase using ETH, USDT, BNB, or even a credit card.

RLUSD trades at ~$1.00, featured on major platforms like Bitstamp, Bullish, and Uphold. Taps into XRP Ledger and Ethereum for fast, compliant payments and DeFi use. What Is RLUSD? RLUSD, short for Ripple USD — is a U.S. dollar–pegged stablecoin issued by Ripple, the same company behind XRP and its global payments infrastructure. Designed to be an enterprise-grade digital dollar, RLUSD is fully backed 1:1 by cash, U.S. Treasuries, and bank deposits , ensuring it maintains a stable $1 value at all times. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins that collapsed in the past (e.g., TerraUSD), RLUSD is issued under strict regulations and monthly third-party audits. This transparency is a core part of Ripple’s strategy to build trust in an industry often plagued by uncertainty. 👉 In essence: RLUSD is Ripple’s answer to USDC and USDT , but with an institutional focus and regulatory oversight from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) . RLUSD Launch Date Ripple officially launched RLUSD on December 17, 2024 , after months of anticipation. The rollout marked a strategic milestone for the company, positioning it directly against Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT — the two dominant stablecoins in crypto today. The timing is notable: RLUSD entered the market just as demand for transparent, compliant stablecoins has surged among banks, fintechs, and institutional investors. Ripple also bolstered its credibility by forming an advisory board with former central bankers and regulators ahead of the launch. RLUSD Price and Market Stability As a stablecoin, the RLUSD price is designed to stay at $1.00 , backed by dollar reserves and liquid assets. While most stablecoins maintain a peg, minor fluctuations (such as $0.999 or $1.001) can occur due to liquidity or exchange spreads. Currently, RLUSD is trading stably around $1, with steady early volume on exchanges like Bitstamp, Uphold, Bullish, and CoinMENA. Ripple’s strategy is to ensure that RLUSD becomes not only a trading pair for crypto investors but also a settlement tool for enterprises, remittances, and DeFi applications. Where to Buy RLUSD Ripple’s stablecoin is already available across multiple platforms: Exchanges : Bitstamp, Bullish, Uphold, CoinMENA, Archax Fiat on/off-ramps : MoonPay, Transak, Mercado Bitcoin (coming soon) Wallets : Xaman (formerly Xumm), Uphold wallet integration This distribution shows Ripple’s intent to blend retail accessibility with enterprise use cases. By launching RLUSD on both the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum (ERC-20), Ripple ensures compatibility with fast payments, decentralized finance (DeFi), and tokenized assets. RLUSD vs. Competitors The stablecoin space is currently dominated by USDT (Tether) and USDC (Circle), which together command over $140 billion in market cap . However, both have faced criticism: Tether for opaque reserves, and Circle for regulatory uncertainty. Ripple aims to differentiate RLUSD by focusing on compliance-first design. While USDT thrives on offshore liquidity, RLUSD targets regulated institutions. Compared with USDC, RLUSD may gain an edge if Ripple secures its U.S. bank charter. Final Thoughts The crypto market has seen many stablecoins come and go — some trusted, others disastrous. With RLUSD, Ripple is betting on trust, transparency, and compliance as the winning formula. Whether it succeeds depends on adoption, regulation, and Ripple’s ability to bridge crypto with traditional finance. For anyone asking: “ What is RLUSD, when did it launch, what’s the price, and where to buy? ” — the answers are now clear. The bigger question is: Will RLUSD become the stablecoin standard for the next era of digital finance?",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|FIAT|USDT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-01 18:12:53

Solana’s near-instant finality and scaling upgrades are making headlines. Over the past week, headlines have turned toward Dogecoin as institutions stack up, and Solana’s Alpenglow upgrade nears validation amplifying interest in fast, low gas fee crypto. Amid this, whispers of a lean, cross-chain DeFi model gaining traction signal a turning point for crypto with real utility. Dogecoin: Institutional Play Picks Up Pace Dogecoin trades around $0.22 today as whales and institutions build sizable positions, setting the stage for a potential breakout. Other reports say Dogecoin dips slightly below $0.22 amid market-wide fear, though accumulation persists. Analysts on X are pointing out that demand from whales and hints at institutional treasury uses could set Dogecoin up for a steady run. In this case, experts say that Dogecoin is ready for a 30% move upwards . Solana: Speed and Scale Under the Spotlight Solana is nearing the validation stage of its Alpenglow consensus upgrade, promising faster processing and better scalability. Meanwhile, major institutions are eyeing a $1 billion Solana treasury, raising expectations of deep liquidity and strategic backing. Its DeFi network is surging. TVL has jumped 20% over the past two months to reach $12.1 billion, with top protocols like Kamino, Jito and Raydium each exceeding $2 billion. Experts note that SOL price has broken out of a triangle and is currently targeting $300 . Remittix (RTX): The Underrated Utility-First Altcoin Remittix stands out as a lean, functional token ecosystem built for payout rails not hype. It’s powered by cross-chain DeFi infrastructure, offering real utility for transfers across borders, with low gas fees and a fast, global-focused DeFi network.

While Dogecoin rides on community buzz and Solana thrives on speed, Remittix wins on real-world utility, strong community engagement and visible momentum ahead of its launch and beta wallet reveal (planned for Q3). Why Remittix Stands Out: Utility-first token powering real transaction volume Real-World Utility: Built for actual use —not just speculation Momentum is building ahead of wallet launch Security First: Audited by CertiK, one of the top blockchain security firms Each point spotlights Remittix’s home-grown tech, practical infrastructure and security focus; giving it an edge over meme tokens and speculative altcoins.

It’s Not Just Hype: Remittix Is the Smart Play Right Now If you’re seeking the next big altcoin, think beyond meme culture or speed wars.

HKMA has started screening applicants, but will issue only a limited number of licences in the initial stage. Final approvals will depend on whether the applications meet strict compliance requirements. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has received 77 expressions of interest for stablecoin licenses and is now conducting meetings with applicants, according to a report published by HK01 on September 1. A spokesperson for the HKMA said the interested parties span multiple sectors, including banks, technology firms, asset managers, e-commerce platforms, payment companies, and Web3 startups. Meetings have already been arranged to assess each party’s intention and readiness. Monetary Authority Received 77 Stablecoin Expressions of Interest The HKMA stated that it would not publish the list of entities that submitted expressions of interest or applications. Communications with these firms are part of the preliminary licensing process and do not indicate regulatory approval or endorsement. “Whether a licence is ultimately granted will depend on whether the application meets the licensing requirements,” the spokesperson said.

The HKMA said the current meetings are meant to help applicants evaluate the necessity and maturity of their issuance plans before deciding to move forward with a formal submission. The spokesperson added that the outcome of the discussions would help both the regulator and the market participants understand the depth and readiness of Hong Kong’s stablecoin ecosystem. The HKMA also reiterated its warning to the public regarding unlicensed stablecoins, advising consumers to remain cautious about promotional materials that do not come from licensed entities. Hong Kong to Set Regulatory Reference Point The stablecoin licensing regime came into effect on August 1. It is one of the city’s core regulatory tools as it continues to develop its virtual asset framework under the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau’s broader digital finance agenda. Formal licence applications are expected to follow in the coming months, though the final number of approved entities remains unclear. The limited availability of licences may lead firms to reassess their strategies. Some could postpone applications, partner with existing licensees, or pursue alternative structures to meet compliance thresholds without applying directly. Hong Kong’s initial screening process will likely set a reference point for other regulatory jurisdictions. Early decisions around transparency, scope, and eligibility may shape how regional markets approach stablecoin oversight going forward. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What risks is the HKMA trying to mitigate with limited early licenses? Concentrating approvals allows the regulator to monitor systemic risk, assess operational practices, and avoid large-scale fallout from early-stage failures. Are there consequences for entities that promote stablecoins without a license? While enforcement mechanisms haven’t been detailed, public warnings suggest the HKMA may escalate scrutiny or coordinate with other regulatory bodies. Will license holders be allowed to offer retail services immediately? Not necessarily. Retail offerings may require separate approvals or phased rollout conditions depending on the applicant’s risk profile and business model.

However, while Dogecoin struggles for steady momentum, investors look elsewhere for projects with more appealing real-world use cases. These highly liquid whales prefer a project with utility and potential, like Remittix, a PayFi project that bridges the gap between crypto and traditional banking systems. This change in direction explains why these top ICO investors regard Remittix as a top performer and a prospect for long-term adoption. Analyzing Dogecoin Price Performance The Dogecoin price has maintained trading in a narrow band, battling resistance between $0.20 and $0.25 while testing support around $0.19. According to market analysts, a price surge above 0.25 would tempt new purchasing pressure, whereas a breakdown below 0.19 would see a rise in selling trends. Source: X (Twitter) Technical patterns support this uncertainty. Chart formations like the symmetrical triangle, cup-and-handle, and ascending triangle all point to the potential for bullish continuation if Dogecoin can ensure a breakout. Still, whales are accumulating and selling in a mix-match, with over 2 billion DOGE added to long-term wallets while $200 million in outflows increases concerns about stability. Such mixed signals leave the Dogecoin price in a balancing trend. Why Investors Choose Remittix Over Dogecoin Remittix offers investors an attribute Dogecoin lacks: a utility catalyst through a solution to real-world payments. Selling at $0.10, the high-growth low-cap crypto gem has been applauded for raising over $23 million and selling over 636 million RTX tokens. With such success, the PayFi project recently announced its second centralized exchange listing on LBank, having passed the 22M level. This growth is a sign of a broader narrative: investors are not only enticed by the speculation, but the idea of a system combining crypto liquidity and ordinary banking promises massive returns. Why Remittix Is Preferred Over More Established Projects Use Cases with Global Reach: Facilitates direct crypto-to-fiat transfers into bank accounts in 30+ countries. Set for Adoption: The wallet beta launching on September 15, 2025, will confirm that it is a working utility. Business Utility: Remittix Pay API enables freelancers and merchants to receive payments in crypto that settle in fiat. Early Market Momentum: Two CEX listings confirmed in quick succession, affirming solid institutional demand. The Dogecoin price history makes it a trader’s token. However, it is vulnerable to resistance barriers, whale flows, and macroeconomic transitions. However, Remittix creates a different path by developing infrastructure with instant, practical adoption.

Dogecoin, known for its meme origin and speculative nature, has seen fluctuating interest levels from the investor community. Yet, as of 2025, the spotlight shifts towards cryptocurrencies like Remittix that bridge crypto functionalities with the traditional banking framework. Remittix has emerged as a preferred choice for smart investors because of its compelling use cases in the PayFi sector, aiming to seamlessly integrate cryptocurrency transactions into mainstream finance systems. An Insight into Dogecoin's Trading Patterns The trading patterns for Dogecoin have been quite restrictive, with its price hovering between $0.20 and $0.25, challenging support levels near $0.19. Market analysts suggest that a breach above $0.25 might trigger buying interest, whereas falling below $0.19 could push the token into bearish territory. Despite these fluctuations, market formations like symmetrical triangles and cup-and-handle suggest potential for upward trends if Dogecoin manages a decisive breakout. However, the anticipation around Dogecoin has been somewhat overshadowed by the innovative approach of Remittix , which appeals to investors looking for a blend of stability and utility in their crypto investments. The Superior Utility of Remittix Unlike Dogecoin, which largely thrives on community hype and speculative trading, Remittix is carving a niche in the financial technology landscape. This utility-driven project facilitates direct crypto-to-fiat transfers, targeting a seamless integration for users across 30+ countries. Furthermore, Remittix's strategic development includes tools like the Remittix Pay API, which empowers freelancers and merchants to receive payments in cryptocurrencies with settlements in fiat currencies, enhancing the flexibility and usability for business transactions worldwide. Here's why investors are choosing Remittix over traditional meme coins: With an impressively strong start in its initial coin offering (ICO) phase, Remittix is not just a concept but a rapidly evolving platform with real-world applications that strike a chord with institutional and retail investors alike.

Experts Have an Even Better Altcoin",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/should-you-buy-ethereum-as-whale-moves-btc-into-49850-eth-experts-have-an-even-better-altcoin/,"A dramatic move in the crypto market is unfolding as a legendary Satoshi-era whale has sold 2,000 BTC valued at around $221 million and rotated the funds into 49,850 ETH worth $219 million. This adjustment, reported on August 30, 2025, increases the whale’s ETH stack to 691,358 tokens, currently worth about $3 billion. The trade took place at an implied $110,500 per Bitcoin and $4,400 per Ethereum. This whale behaviour is exploiting trust in BTC and also simultaneously increasing the popularity of Ethereum. However, despite this increasing influence of Ethereum, analysts believe that, however, at this time MUTM will be the most beneficial crypto to be purchased. Ethereum Gains Whale Backing Ethereum is receiving new attention as a store of value rivaling Bitcoin. The Satoshi-era wallet now tilts heavily towards ETH, indicating belief in Ethereum’s future role. Investors are watching closely, as large-scale BTC-to-ETH swaps often trigger price responses across crypto charts. On-chain data already indicates that ETH trading volumes have increased 15 percent in the hours after the whale was active, further fueling speculation on where crypto prices today are heading. In addition, Ethereum has proved to be more resilient than Bitcoin volatility. According to analysts, in case whales persist with this trend, ETH may challenge new resistance levels around $5,000. Nevertheless, the traders who track the crypto fear and greed index also know that the rallies caused by hype may pose short-term risks. As a result, ETH is performing well but retail traders are not convinced that it is the most suitable cryptocurrency to invest in at the moment. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum It is now centred on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is now in Phase 6 of the presale. The price of the tokens will be increased to 250 percent of the first phase price by selling them at a price of $0.035. Since the open of the presale, $15,220,000 has been raised and 15,880 holders are included. After Phase 7 start, the price outlook is an over 14% jump. At launch, MUTM will list at $0.06, offering early buyers potential returns in the range of 300% to 500%. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a dual lending platform combining peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer systems. Such flexibility is rare among new crypto coins, positioning MUTM as one of the best cryptos to buy now compared to legacy tokens. Utility, Security, And Investor Rewards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not only focusing on lending mechanics but also addressing stability through its overcollateralized stablecoin system. The coin is minted only when loans are issued and burned upon repayment, ensuring sustainable supply. Combined with Layer-2 integration for faster and cheaper transactions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is aiming to attract a wide base of crypto investing participants. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also found an opportunity to further build trust, thus opening a bug-bounty programme in the form of $50,000 seems to be done together with CertiK. The rewards are tiered from critical to low severity, ensuring all potential risks are addressed. Additionally, the project is engaging its growing community through a $100,000 giveaway , in which 10 winners will be awarded with $10,000 in MUTM. To become eligible, one has to invest in the presale with only a $50 amount. Why Mutuum Finance Stands Out Ethereum is gaining whale support, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is providing retail investors with a fresh opportunity at accessible prices. For those asking what crypto to buy now, experts are pointing firmly at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the project that blends utility, security, and high-growth potential.

This Data Says So,https://cryptopotato.com/is-eths-long-term-bull-run-just-getting-started-this-data-says-so/,"TL;DR Ethereum mirrors global liquidity trends, exiting accumulation and entering a potential long-term bull phase. $4,520 remains a key resistance level for ETH; a breakout could trigger a rally toward $4,800 or higher. September may be weak, but Q4 often flips bullish, averaging gains across October to December. Ethereum Moves With Global Liquidity Shift Ethereum is showing a pattern that closely tracks the movement of global M2 liquidity. A chart shared by analyst Merlijn The Trader shows the price of ETH rising alongside broader liquidity growth. Interestingly, the accumulation zone, marked below the $2,750 level, appears to have ended , as ETH enters a new phase labeled “Bull Run” on the chart. Merlijn said, “Accumulation is done. The bull run is alive,” and added, “This isn’t hopium, it’s macro.” The chart shows both ETH and liquidity moving higher, suggesting that Ethereum is responding to shifts in the broader money supply. ETHEREUM IS TRACKING GLOBAL LIQUIDITY Accumulation is done. The bull run is alive. Global liquidity is expanding higher and $ETH is mirroring the move. This isn’t hopium, it’s macro. Miss it now, and you’ll be chasing above $6K. pic.twitter.com/Ggc2p5GxDS — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) August 31, 2025 Ethereum is trading just below a key resistance level at $4,520. Analyst Lennaert Snyder posted a liquidity heatmap that shows a high concentration of sell orders around that zone. “ETH liquidity laying around key $4,520 resistance. Could Ethereum reclaim it today?” he asked . A move through this level could open the way for further upside, but failure to clear it may result in short-term pullbacks. Market Awaits Breakout From Triangle Pattern On the 4-hour chart, Ethereum is compressing inside a symmetrical triangle. This pattern has been developing for over 10 days. Snyder pointed out that a breakout is likely soon, given the narrowing price range. $ETH about to choose a direction. It’s in compression for 10 days now, a breakout should happen soon. If Ethereum breaks out upwards, we probably go for the $4,800 rangehigh. A downward breakout leads ~$4,000 as first support level. pic.twitter.com/PckkgSVoaM — Lennaert Snyder (@LennaertSnyder) September 1, 2025 A breakout to the upside would put $4,837 in play as the next target. If the asset breaks downward, the first support area is near $4,071, followed by additional zones at $3,900 and $3,700. These levels could attract buyers if the price moves lower. Seasonal History Shows Mixed Outlook Past data suggests that September has often been a weak month for Ethereum. Analyst Cipher X noted the average return for September is -6.1%. Years like 2020 and 2022 saw double-digit drops, though 2021 saw a strong rally. Source: X Cipher said, “September might be choppy but the months that follow have usually been much friendlier to ETH.” October, November, and December have often seen price recoveries, with average returns of over 6% in each of those months.

According to Wedson, BTC is currently struggling to stay above its Short-Term Trader (STH) Realized Price of $109,200. The analyst stated that the course below this critical threshold creates negative social sentiment in the market and causes the selling pressure to continue, saying: “As long as Bitcoin doesn't stay above $109,200, selling pressure and negative social sentiment will persist. Staying above this level could create a relatively more positive outlook for traders. However, the best strategy right now seems to be to observe.” Related News: ETF Expert Analyst Says, “Don't Underestimate XRP and Solana ETF Approvals,” Shares What He Expects Wedson also offered a compelling perspective not only on the crypto market but also on global economic balances. Referring to historical cycles, the analyst argued that countries like Brazil will gain greater importance over the next 40 years: This isn't just true for Brazil; it's true for many countries. Looking back at human history, great civilizations like the Persians, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans eventually collapsed, and new powers rose.

The new Mexico-based company will play an important role in expanding financial technology services across the region. Binance is positioning itself as a serious force in Mexico’s growing fintech and crypto landscape by committing heavily into its new venture. Medá Creates A Fresh Path for Binance in Latin America The new entity, Medá, has been formally registered as an Electronic Payment Funds Institution (IFPE). This status places it under the regulation of Mexican financial authorities. This regulatory oversight is set to give Medá the legal framework to support deposits and withdrawals in Mexican pesos. Binance confirmed that Medá will function as an independent division, with its own leadership and operations team. This independence, the company explained, will help Medá set a higher standard in the local market. Its goal is to build a sustainable model that improves trust and accessibility for Mexican users. As part of its effort, Binance is also partnering with Spanish banking giant BBVA to provide customers with a safer way to store their digital assets. Binance Bets Big on Mexico’s Digital Finance Future As announced, Binance has pledged to invest over one billion Mexican pesos equivalent to $53 million in Medá during the next four years. This investment will go into creating simple and easy-to-use digital services that make financial technology more accessible. Binance said the plan is to give millions of Mexicans affordable and useful tools while encouraging more people to use digital finance. This comes as an earlier survey showed that crypto adoption in Latin America is growing, with 95% crypto users are looking to expand their digital portfolio. For the trading platform, Mexico is more than just another market, it is a key part of its growth in the region. With over 125 million people, the country has huge potential for digital finance and crypto adoption. Binance Grows Stronger in Latin America Guilherme Nazar, Binance’s vice president for Latin America, said Medá will help increase competition in the region. He explained that the platform is expected to become a strong local rival for services that support peso-based transactions. He also noted that competition is good for consumers because it pushes companies to offer better services at lower costs. Apart from launching Medá in Mexico, Binance has also grown its presence in Latin America through Binance Pay. The crypto payments platform has expanded quickly and now supports money transfers in nine countries, including Colombia, Argentina, and Honduras. With Binance Pay, users can send crypto that receivers can easily turn into money in their bank accounts. In Brazil, Binance went further by getting a broker-dealer license, making it the first crypto exchange in the country to achieve this. This step strengthens Binance’s legal and business position in Latin America’s largest economy.

That hunt for velocity is pushing some big ADA wallets to scout newer names with clearer near-term catalysts. Remittix is a payments-first altcoin built around real-world usage rather than headline cycles. In this piece, we unpack why ADA’s pace looks steady, not explosive, and why Remittix keeps popping up as the high-growth crypto candidate for those eyeing a 5,000% swing, without abandoning Cardano’s longer-term promise. Cardano Price Faces Pressure Despite Long-Term Optimism Cardano still commands a loyal crowd, but the chart’s been a mixed bag. This week, ADA hovered in a tight $0.802–$0.88 band, a tell that thinning volume and macro jitters are keeping investors cautious. This has pushed many ADA whales to diversify into newer projects that show greater momentum and immediate catalysts. Among those options, Remittix has become a prime candidate, backed by real-world payments use cases and clear progress on exchange listings. Remittix Targets Explosive Growth With Utility and Adoption Unlike Cardano, which is reliant on gradual network upgrades, Remittix is being adopted quickly because of its PayFi model. Investors view it as an altcoin capable of massive upside, with analysts projecting gains of up to 5,000% by early 2026. Recent reports confirm that Remittix has sold over 636 million tokens, raised more than $23 million, and is priced at just $0.10. After crossing the $20 million mark, Remittix secured its first CEX listing on BitMart, and with momentum above $22 million, a second listing was confirmed on LBANK. This pace has not only drawn Cardano holders but also caught the attention of wider retail and institutional players. Compared with ADA’s slower climb, Remittix offers immediate triggers, including a $250,000 giveaway and the rollout of its wallet beta in Q3 2025. These catalysts make it attractive to those seeking life-changing gains before January. Here are five reasons analysts say Remittix could be the breakout altcoin: Solving a real-world $19 trillion payments problem Direct crypto to bank transfers in 30+ countries Wallet beta launches this quarter with real-time FX conversion Deflationary tokenomics designed for long-term holder value Backed by working infrastructure rather than speculation Why Remittix Could Be the Fast Track to the Gains Cardano Holders Want Cardano remains an important project in the blockchain space, but its current pace suggests only steady growth rather than the sharp rallies needed for 5,000% gains. This has pushed a wave of ADA holders to look elsewhere for faster rewards. As excitement builds around its wallet launch and $250,000 giveaway, Remittix is being tipped as one of the only altcoins capable of delivering the explosive returns Cardano holders are hoping for. If momentum continues, this PayFi project could well be the coin that reshapes 2025’s success stories.

The Shift from Cardano to Remittix Cardano has been a mainstay in the portfolios of many crypto investors due to its robust roadmap and technological foundation.

Weak fundamentals and cooling token burn momentum are dampening investor confidence. As Shiba Inu sentiment softens, attention turns toward altcoins with real use cases. One standout is Remittix , which has quickly raised over $23 million while launching a $250,000 giveaway and preparing its Q3 wallet beta. In a world moving beyond meme coin hype, Remittix offers a practical pathway to growth. Shiba Inu Faces Technical Stress And Declining Investor Interest Shiba Inu is under pressure. Trading volumes are falling while its weighted funding rate has turned negative, both warning signs of declining demand and possible extended correction. Technical indicators show Shiba Inu trading beneath the Ichimoku cloud and facing fragile support near $0.0000069, a drop of over 40% from current levels if that support fails. Add to that a pattern of repeated failed rebounds and waning whale activity, and Shiba Inu looks increasingly vulnerable to a 20% or greater crash before year's end. Remittix Offers a Use-case-centered Alternative Amid Shiba Inu’s Weakness While Shiba Inu stumbles on speculation and weak fundamentals, Remittix is building genuine utility, positioning itself as a replacement for investors looking beyond cyclical meme value. Remittix is priced at $0.10, has sold over 636 million tokens, and has raised over $23 million. After passing $20 million, it earned a listing on BitMart; surpassing $22 million secured a second listing on LBANK. The Q3 2025 wallet beta is approaching, and a $250,000 community giveaway is underway. Here is why Remittix may outperform in the current climate: Addresses a $19 trillion global payments gap with real-world application Enables crypto to bank remittances across 30+ countries Utility-oriented design with actual transaction volume, not hype Built for adoption rather than speculative cycles Early entry ahead of broader market exposure and listing momentum In contrast to Shiba Inu, which relies on hype and burn mechanics, Remittix delivers practical PayFi infrastructure, attracting capital while others wane. Why Remittix Could Become the Utility Champion as Meme Coins Fade Shiba Inu may face losses exceeding 20% before December as momentum fades and fundamentals deteriorate. That slide could push investors toward altcoins with functional value, like Remittix. With high fundraising success, exchange listings, a wallet beta, and strategic community outreach, Remittix offers a rooted growth narrative amid meme coin uncertainty. If burning hype gives way to real utility, Remittix may emerge as the crypto that truly delivers.

Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, a significant portion of XRP’s total supply was pre-mined in 2012, with Ripple Labs receiving a large allocation at launch. Today, investors and analysts often ask: “ Who owns the most XRP, and how is it distributed? ” The answer gives insight into liquidity, whale influence, and how much control Ripple still exerts over the token’s ecosystem. Top XRP Holders by Percentage Based on recent blockchain data, here’s a breakdown of the largest XRP holders by percentage of total supply (100 billion XRP maximum supply): 1. Ripple Labs Escrow Accounts — ~40–45% Ripple placed much of its allocation into escrow, releasing around 1 billion XRP per month. This remains Ripple’s largest share, though not all is in circulation. 2. Ripple Treasury & Operating Wallets — ~5–6% Beyond escrow, Ripple controls wallets for operations, partnerships, and liquidity. 3. Founders & Early Executives — ~3–5% Co-founders like Chris Larsen (Ripple’s former CEO) and Jed McCaleb (who sold his allocation years ago) once held billions. Larsen still ranks among top individual holders. 4. Exchanges (Binance, Bitstamp, Uphold, Kraken) — ~10–12% combined Centralized exchanges hold large XRP reserves on behalf of customers. Binance alone holds billions in multiple wallets. 5. XRP Whales & Institutional Custodians — ~5–7% A small group of wallets outside Ripple and exchanges hold significant XRP reserves. These could be hedge funds, custodians, or private whales. 6. Retail Investors — ~25–30% The rest of circulating XRP is distributed across millions of small wallets, though most wallets hold under 1,000 XRP. XRP Whales and Their Influence Whale wallets — those holding millions or billions of XRP play a key role in liquidity. When whales move large sums, it often sparks speculation about price impact. For example: Chris Larsen’s wallets are closely tracked by the community. Exchange inflows/outflows signal retail demand. Escrow releases influence overall supply dynamics. Despite concerns about centralization, Ripple argues that controlled escrow releases prevent flooding the market and create predictable liquidity. Ripple vs. The Market Ripple’s dominance in XRP holdings is a double-edged sword: Pro : Ensures liquidity for institutional use, partnerships, and payment solutions. Con : Critics argue it centralizes control and creates uncertainty about future token unlocks. However, Ripple has steadily reduced its share as more XRP enters circulation. The wider distribution among exchanges and retail users signals increasing decentralization over time. Why Holder Percentages Matter for Investors Knowing top XRP holders by percentage helps investors understand: Large holders could impact price if they sell. Escrow releases are structured, avoiding sudden dumps. Exchange holdings reflect user demand and trading volume. For example, keyword searches like “top XRP holders by percentage” have surged, showing investor interest in whale tracking and Ripple’s role in supply control. Final Thoughts XRP’s ownership remains concentrated, with Ripple Labs still controlling the largest portion via escrow and treasury wallets. But as more XRP enters the market and retail adoption grows, the distribution is slowly broadening. For now, XRP remains a unique case among top cryptos: a digital asset where a company, exchanges, and whales share control of its destiny.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-01 18:36:35

This popular meme coin is facing several challenges that could lead to a substantial price drop before the year is out. At the heart of the issue are weak fundamentals and a slowdown in the rate of token burning, which have both contributed to declining investor interest. In contrast, Remittix has been making headlines for all the right reasons. With over $23 million raised and significant milestones reached, this altcoin seems to be on the brink of something big, offering a stark alternative to the speculative nature of meme coins like Shiba Inu. The Downward Spiral of Shiba Inu Recent trends indicate troubling times ahead for Shiba Inu. With a negative weighted funding rate and diminishing trading volumes, the technical outlook is bleak. The coin is currently trading below key technical levels, such as the Ichimoku cloud, which suggests a potential price collapse if it fails to hold critical support points. This decline is further evidenced by a decrease in large investor (or ""whale"") activity and several failed attempts to rally. These factors collectively point towards a potential downturn exceeding 20% by December. Remittix: A Beacon of Utility in the Altcoin World While Shiba Inu may be waning, Remittix is gaining traction with its clear use-case and robust infrastructure. It’s not just surviving in the volatile crypto market—it’s poised to thrive. With its latest achievements including a successful $250,000 giveaway and the upcoming launch of its Q3 wallet beta, Remittix is clearly differentiating itself from the typical speculative plays in the cryptocurrency space. Its strategy focuses on real-world applications, especially in addressing the global payments gap, which could potentially make it a leader in the PayFi sector. This approach might just be what sets it apart and ensures its long-term relevance and success in the cryptocurrency world. Remittix’s advantages include enabling crypto-to-bank remittances across more than 30 countries and crafting a system built for wide adoption rather than mere speculation. Its focus on utility over hype is resonating well with investors seeking more stability and practical use from their crypto investments. Conclusion: The Shift towards Utility The crypto market is evolving, and as meme coins like Shiba Inu may struggle to maintain interest without substantial utility, coins like Remittix stand ready to fill the gap. This shift could redefine investor preferences in the crypto space, favoring cryptocurrencies that provide real-world solutions and sustainable growth over mere speculative buzz.

In a move that has captured significant attention, Deutsche Bank, one of Europe’s largest financial institutions, has substantially increased its Deutsche Bank MSTR investment . This action reflects a fascinating shift in how established players are approaching digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, through indirect yet powerful channels. Why is Deutsche Bank Increasing its MSTR Investment? According to reports from BitcoinTreasuries, Deutsche Bank made a noteworthy addition of an extra $47 million worth of MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares during the second quarter. This isn’t just a minor portfolio adjustment; it represents a significant commitment. MicroStrategy, led by its vocal proponent Michael Saylor, has famously adopted a corporate strategy centered around acquiring and holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin. Significant Acquisition: Deutsche Bank added $47 million in MSTR shares in Q2. Growing Holdings: The bank now holds a total of 658,725 MSTR shares. Substantial Value: These holdings are currently valued at an impressive $220 million. Indirect Bitcoin Exposure: Investing in MSTR stock offers an indirect way for institutions like Deutsche Bank to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This strategic move by Deutsche Bank provides a clear signal about the increasing comfort level traditional financial giants have with assets tied to the crypto ecosystem. The Deutsche Bank MSTR investment strategy highlights a preference for regulated, publicly traded vehicles when navigating the digital asset space. The Strategic Rationale Behind Institutional MSTR Holdings For large institutions like Deutsche Bank, investing in MicroStrategy’s stock offers several compelling advantages over direct Bitcoin purchases. Firstly, MSTR is a publicly traded company, meaning its shares are regulated and can be bought and sold on traditional stock exchanges. This provides a familiar and compliant framework for institutional investors. Moreover, holding MSTR shares simplifies custody and regulatory considerations that often accompany direct cryptocurrency investments. While the underlying asset is Bitcoin, the investment itself is in equity, fitting neatly into existing portfolio management and risk assessment models. This approach allows institutions to participate in Bitcoin’s growth potential while mitigating some of the unique operational challenges of digital asset management. The decision to pursue a Deutsche Bank MSTR investment is not an isolated incident but rather part of a broader trend where traditional finance seeks compliant and familiar avenues into the digital asset landscape. It underscores the innovative ways institutions are adapting to market demand and exploring new investment frontiers. What Does This Deutsche Bank MSTR Investment Signify for the Crypto Market? This substantial investment by Deutsche Bank carries significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. It serves as a powerful validation of Bitcoin’s long-term viability and its increasing acceptance as a legitimate asset class, even if through a proxy. When a global banking behemoth like Deutsche Bank makes such a move, it often encourages other institutions to consider similar strategies. The growing institutional interest can lead to increased liquidity and stability in the crypto market. However, it also brings challenges, such as potential for increased correlation with traditional markets and scrutiny from regulators. This particular Deutsche Bank MSTR investment showcases a pivotal moment where traditional finance is not just observing, but actively participating in the digital asset revolution. It’s a clear indication that the narrative around Bitcoin is shifting from a speculative niche asset to a more recognized and strategically important component for diversified portfolios. This institutional embrace, even through indirect means, could pave the way for more direct engagement in the future as regulatory clarity evolves. Actionable Insights and the Road Ahead for Institutional Crypto For investors and enthusiasts, the increased Deutsche Bank MSTR investment offers several key insights. Firstly, it highlights the enduring appeal of Bitcoin as a store of value and its potential for growth, even in the eyes of conservative financial players. Secondly, it suggests that indirect exposure through vehicles like MSTR will likely continue to be a preferred method for institutional entry into the crypto space in the short to medium term. Looking ahead, market participants should closely monitor further institutional disclosures and regulatory developments. As more traditional banks and financial firms explore these avenues, it could accelerate the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. This strategic move by Deutsche Bank is a powerful indicator of the evolving landscape where digital assets are progressively integrated into the global financial fabric. In conclusion, Deutsche Bank’s significant increase in its MicroStrategy holdings is more than just a transaction; it’s a profound statement. This Deutsche Bank MSTR investment underscores the undeniable trend of institutional capital flowing into the crypto-adjacent space, solidifying Bitcoin’s position as a serious contender in the global financial arena. It marks a bold step towards a future where the lines between traditional finance and digital assets continue to blur, driven by strategic foresight and a recognition of changing market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is MicroStrategy (MSTR)? MicroStrategy is a business intelligence company that has adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. This means the company holds a significant amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet, making its stock (MSTR) a way for investors to gain indirect exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements. Why did Deutsche Bank invest in MSTR instead of Bitcoin directly? Investing in MSTR stock offers traditional financial institutions like Deutsche Bank a regulated and familiar pathway to gain Bitcoin exposure. It allows them to leverage existing equity trading infrastructure, avoid the complexities of direct crypto custody, and navigate regulatory landscapes more easily compared to direct Bitcoin purchases. Is this Deutsche Bank MSTR investment a bullish sign for Bitcoin? Generally, yes. Increased institutional investment, even indirectly through MSTR, signals growing confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. It suggests that major financial players see long-term value in Bitcoin, which can contribute to positive market sentiment and potentially attract further capital. What are the risks associated with investing in MSTR? While MSTR offers Bitcoin exposure, it also carries risks associated with both equity markets and cryptocurrency volatility. Its stock price can be influenced by MicroStrategy’s business performance, broader stock market trends, and, significantly, the price fluctuations of Bitcoin. Investors should be aware of these combined risks. Will other major banks follow Deutsche Bank’s lead? Deutsche Bank’s move could certainly encourage other financial institutions to explore similar strategies for Bitcoin exposure. As regulatory clarity improves and the digital asset market matures, it’s plausible that more banks will seek compliant and strategic ways to participate, whether directly or indirectly.

Cardano Price Analysis: Is This Cardano’s Next Major Price Catalyst? The market-warming effect of Grayscale’s S-1 filing could give Cardano the momentum it needs to break out of a bull flag pattern forming since its August rally peak. ADA / USD 1-day chart, bull flag feeds ascending channel breakout. Source: TradingView. This comes as momentum indicators show reversal signs. The RSI is trending back toward the neutral 50 line, now at 48, suggesting buying pressure is building. More so, the MACD line is starting to flatten below the signal line, often an early sign of a bullish shift—particularly as $0.80 continues to hold as support. If fully realized, the flag pattern sets up a retest of the ascending channel forming since late July, targeting a 45% move to $1.20. With a successful channel breakout, the rally could extend to $1.70 for a 105% gain in the build-up to the ETF decision, though its December high at $1.40 is likely to act as resistance. Once approved, an ADA spot ETF approval would provide regulated exposure for the first time. That step toward integration with U.S. capital markets could ignite substantial new demand, extending the rally far beyond technical setups. With this catalyst, the Cardano price could revisit its all-time high near $3 , a potential 260% upside from current levels.

This allocation means XRP holders can claim up to 1.2 billion free NIGHT tokens, distributed based on XRP balances from a snapshot taken in June. During Consensus 2025, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson confirmed that XRP holders would be included in the NIGHT airdrop to foster ecosystem collaboration and reward long-term supporters. Cardano Founder Reiterates That #XRP Holders Will Receive Midnight Airdrop pic.twitter.com/ztGkAfP2bg — XRP CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) March 3, 2025 XRP Price Action Points Bearish Despite NIGHT Airdrop Launch XRP holders have 60 days to claim their NIGHT tokens before the Glacier phase ends, with a second opportunity during the Scavenger Mine phase for those who miss the initial window. To qualify, users needed at least $100 worth of XRP during the snapshot, with the claim window remaining open until mid-September. NIGHT provides governance rights and seeks to drive cross-chain collaboration across major blockchains. Despite rewarding long-term XRP supporters, the Ripple token has been affected by weak market conditions. Over the past seven days, XRP has declined 6.93%, pulling back from its August high of $3.38. However, XRP has delivered the strongest year-to-date performance among the top 10 cryptocurrencies with a 392.22% return, rising from $0.4936 to $3.65. Source: CoinMarketCap With profit-taking underway and crypto markets in a state of fear, analysts believe XRP , currently trading around $2.74, must defend the $2.70 support level to break the immediate resistance at $2.90. XRP Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Flashes Bullish Rebound at $2.70 Support Technical analysis shows a clean break below support would expose the next key level near $2.33, indicating deeper downside risk. On the upside, the first major barrier sits at $3.03, with targets at $3.16 and $3.31 if momentum strengthens. Source: TradingView The RSI trends near 33, approaching oversold conditions, which suggests that selling pressure remains strong but may soon begin to exhaust. If buyers defend $2.70, a rebound toward $3.03 resistance is possible. However, if bears push below this level, the probability of a swift drop to $2.33 increases. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Gains Momentum Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) is a crypto project that has been selling tokens early to raise money, as many investors keep putting money into it. Bitcoin Hyper wants to make Bitcoin faster and cheaper to use. Think of it like adding extra lanes to a busy highway, so more cars can travel at once. So far, Bitcoin Hyper has raised over $13.3 million, which shows that many people want to buy these tokens before they become available to everyone. Right now, one HYPER token costs about $0.012845, and the price goes up every three days or when buyers purchase all the tokens during each round. Some experts think the token could be worth $0.20 by the end of 2025. By 2030, it might reach $1.20. If this happens, your money could grow 20 to 50 times bigger. You can buy any amount you want by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website . You can pay with other crypto coins like ETH or USDT, or use your regular bank card.

According to a crypto analyst, the meme coin faces two stark possibilities: a massive bullish breakout that could catapult DOGE by 800% to a new peak of $1.82, followed by a potential crash that may drag the meme coin’s value below $0.1. Dogecoin Price To See Massive Rally Before Crash In an August 31 post on X social media, crypto analyst KrissPax announced that Dogecoin may be on the verge of a dramatic rally if historical price action and Fibonacci Extensions play out. He projected that DOGE could trade up to the 2.618 Fibonacci level this fall, which aligns with the $1.82 price mark. Such a bullish move would represent a remarkable 800% gain from the meme coin’s current value of roughly $0.218. Related Reading: Pundit Reveals Catalysts That Will Drive Dogecoin Price 150% To $0.55 KrissPax shared a chart showing multiple accumulation zones where Dogecoin held firm despite broader market corrections, indicating that long-term holders could be reinforcing price stability. Although the outlook points to an explosive upside potential for DOGE, the analyst also warned that a looming bearish scenario is still in play. Based on the chart’s trajectory, once Dogecoin hits the projected $1.82 all-time high, the meme coin could experience a steep crash toward $0.09 (0.236 Fibonacci retracement), revisiting its weakest levels since 2023. KrissPax referred to this zone as a “gift” in his chart, suggesting it may offer a chance to accumulate at lower prices. With the price now hovering near key resistance, Dogecoin appears to be approaching a decisive moment that could determine its next target. For investors, this presents a classic high-risk, high-reward setup that could offer strong gains to early accumulation ahead of a breakout or deliver significant losses if bearish pressure sends the meme coin plummeting. Moving forward, KrissPax indicated that Dogecoin’s current low price, relative to its previous peaks, could be an opportunity for traders to add to their portfolios. He warns that hesitating to buy at discounted levels could result in being left out when DOGE begins another steep climb. $0.23 Identified As Key Breakout Threshold In a separate X post, crypto market expert Ali Martinez shared his latest Dogecoin analysis, taking a more bullish stand. He pointed to a symmetrical triangle pattern forming on the Dogecoin 4-hour chart, where price action has been consolidating between tightening support and resistance lines. Based on his analysis, this type of formation often signals an impending breakout, with the direction ultimately determined by which boundary the pattern is breached. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Is Ready To Launch 100%+ With This Swing Move Martinez has identified $0.23 as the critical level to watch. If Dogecoin breaks above this threshold with convincing volume, it could trigger a fresh bullish rally toward higher resistance levels at $0.25, $0.28, and potentially $0.30. The analyst’s chart projection outlines a step-like ascent once the breakout is confirmed, suggesting a sustainable rally rather than an immediate spike.

51030425,570590,1756753257,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51030425.jpeg,XRP Holds $2.80 Support as Whales Accumulate Nearly $1B: Could this Be Start to $4?,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-holds-2-80-support-as-whales-accumulate-more/,"XRP has managed to hold its $2.80 support despite a sharp 4% drop over the past 24 hours, falling from $2.85 to $2.75 in the Aug. 31–Sept. 1 trading session. The sell-off was fueled by institutional liquidations totaling $1.9 billion since July, but whale investors took the opposite stance, scooping up 340 million XRP worth nearly $962 million during the dip. This accumulation suggests that large holders view current prices as a strategic entry point, even as short-term traders exit positions. Data also shows $268 million in XRP leaving exchanges, reinforcing the view that long-term investors are tightening supply in anticipation of future gains. Technical Setup Points XRP Toward $4 From a technical perspective, XRP’s immediate support lies between $2.75–$2.77, with resistance seen at $2.80–$2.87. Analysts note that a close above $2.87 could open the path toward $3.30, a critical breakout zone that could trigger further momentum. Momentum indicators back the bullish case. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped into oversold territory, while MACD compression hints at a potential bullish crossover. On the charts, XRP is consolidating inside a symmetrical triangle pattern, similar to formations that preceded explosive rallies in 2017. Liquidity maps show clusters of activity extending to $4.00, indicating possible targets if the breakout materializes. Whales Diverge From Institutional Selling The contrasting behavior between whales and institutions is shaping market dynamics. While institutions have offloaded nearly $2 billion in XRP since July, whale absorption of 340 million tokens suggests confidence in the token’s longer-term trajectory. Funding rates have also flipped positive, and open interest in XRP derivatives now stands above $8 billion, signaling that traders are positioning for upward moves. If buying pressure holds and September’s seasonal weakness is overcome, XRP could mount a recovery rally toward the $4 region. Bottom Line XRP’s ability to defend $2.80, supported by nearly $1 billion in whale accumulation, strengthens the case for a potential breakout. If resistance levels fall, a run toward $4 may be closer than many expect, though September volatility and regulatory headwinds remain key risks.

Ruvi AI (RUVI) has captured expert attention with its Phase 2 concluding in record time, generating momentum that analysts believe positions it as the superior opportunity for investors seeking exponential gains. With advanced technology, institutional backing, and structured growth phases, this audited project is creating conditions that experts predict will deliver massive returns faster than Dogecoin’s next major rally. Why Dogecoin’s 100x Journey Faces Mathematical Challenges The fundamental issue confronting Dogecoin’s next 100x potential lies in basic market mathematics. With its current market capitalization requiring extraordinary capital inflows to achieve 100x appreciation, analysts warn that such gains may be “far away” or potentially unrealistic within reasonable timeframes. Dogecoin’s reliance on viral trends and social media momentum creates unpredictable volatility that makes sustained exponential growth increasingly difficult as market cap grows. In contrast, Ruvi AI operates from a significantly lower market entry point with structured phases designed to create predictable appreciation patterns. The project’s Phase 2 completion in record time demonstrates organic demand that analysts believe provides the foundation for faster massive returns compared to Dogecoin’s speculative trajectory. Professional Foundation Accelerates Massive Return Potential What sets Ruvi AI apart as the faster path to massive returns is its commitment to institutional-grade standards that serious wealth-building investors demand. The project established unshakeable credibility through a comprehensive security audit conducted by CyberScope , a respected third-party auditing firm that thoroughly examined its smart contracts and eliminated technical vulnerabilities. This professional validation proved instrumental when Ruvi AI secured its strategic listing on CoinMarketCap , the world’s most trusted cryptocurrency data platform. The listing triggered unprecedented institutional interest that transformed expert analysis into concrete recommendations, generating presale metrics that demonstrate the fastest path to massive returns: Almost $3.3M raised with record-breaking velocity demonstrating serious institutional confidence Over 250M tokens sold to a rapidly expanding global investor community A holder base surpassing 3,200 investors , with exponential growth patterns supporting massive return potential These figures showcase the organic demand that analysts recognize as foundational indicators of projects positioned to deliver massive returns faster than Dogecoin’s mature trajectory allows. Revolutionary Super App Drives Faster Growth Than Meme Coins While Dogecoin lacks underlying utility to drive sustained appreciation, Ruvi AI has strategically positioned itself within the explosive $104 billion creator economy through its revolutionary super app. This comprehensive AI-powered toolkit transforms how millions of content creators operate across all major platforms, creating immediate utility that drives sustainable demand necessary for massive returns. Advanced Trend Research identifies viral topics before they mainstream, giving users competitive advantages in the fast-moving content landscape where timing determines profitability. AI-Powered Script Generation creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram that maximize audience retention and boost creator earnings potential. Native Media Creation generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, eliminating expensive third-party dependencies that drain creator budgets. Streamlined Workflows centralize planning, editing, and scheduling processes for maximum productivity. This utility-first approach creates immediate, tangible value that analysts believe provides the fundamental proposition necessary for faster massive returns while Dogecoin faces the limitations of meme coin economics. Phase 3 Launch Accelerates Path to Massive Returns With Phase 2 concluding in record time due to overwhelming demand, Ruvi AI has launched Phase 3 with unprecedented momentum. Tokens are now available at $0.020 , creating what experts describe as the final opportunity to position for massive returns at ground-floor pricing before institutional capital fully enters the market. Phase 4 will bring an automatic 40% price increment , raising the token price to $0.028 . This guaranteed increase creates immediate catalysts that provide foundation returns before broader market recognition drives the appreciation necessary for massive returns faster than Dogecoin’s uncertain trajectory. Strategic Exchange Partnership Ensures Sustained Growth To guarantee seamless market transition and institutional participation necessary for massive returns, Ruvi AI has secured a strategic partnership with WEEX , a major cryptocurrency exchange. This partnership ensures deep liquidity and professional trading infrastructure that enables sustained growth while providing the institutional access that drives massive return potential. VIP Program Creates Structured Massive Return Pathways The most compelling aspect supporting expert predictions lies in Ruvi AI’s structured VIP program, which provides clear mathematical pathways to massive returns: VIP 2 ($1,000 investment) : Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment) : Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 5 ($10,000 investment) : Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . These structured returns demonstrate massive return potential that provides clear superiority over Dogecoin’s speculative appreciation patterns. Community Engagement Drives Momentum Beyond structured returns, Ruvi AI has implemented a competitive leaderboard giveaway system that rewards dedicated supporters with additional tokens and exclusive benefits. This gamification strategy creates viral community engagement that drives the sustained momentum necessary for achieving massive returns faster than community-dependent meme coins. Expert Consensus: Faster Path to Massive Returns The convergence of record-time Phase 2 completion, professional audit validation, revolutionary utility targeting a massive market, and structured pathways showing clear routes to massive returns creates conditions that experts unanimously believe position Ruvi AI as the faster path to exponential gains. With almost $3.3 million raised, over 250 million tokens sold with unprecedented velocity, and institutional backing through the WEEX partnership, this project exhibits characteristics that enable rapid appreciation while Dogecoin faces the mathematical challenges of achieving its next 100x rally.

Nations such as China, India, and Russia have reached advanced pilot phases, while others remain in development, and this movement has drawn attention to XRP. Crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) recently posted about Ripple’s positioning within this growing landscape, citing JP Morgan’s remarks from the Money20/20 conference. The post noted how Ripple was included alongside other companies in a discussion on the future of money and the role of CBDCs. According to SMQKE, JP Morgan considers Ripple a “heavyweight in the age of the CBDCs.” J.P Morgan considers Ripple a “heavyweight in the age of the CBDCs.” Documented. https://t.co/JH78WvNe5i pic.twitter.com/Eybkmh4Few — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 1, 2025 JP Morgan’s Comments on XRP The image attached to the post comes from JP Morgan’s official materials covering the Money20/20 event. In a section titled “Money reimagined,” Ripple was listed among the organizations presenting perspectives on how money could evolve in the digital era. The panel discussion divided its focus between developed economies, where initiatives such as the Digital Dollar and Digital Euro are advancing, and less developed markets, where decentralized finance and stablecoins are offering new access points for financial services. Ripple’s Position in the Conversation JP Morgan’s recognition of Ripple as a major participant in the CBDC conversation reinforces XRP’s role as a crucial part of the shift toward digital payments and advanced cross-border settlement systems . Ripple has engaged with multiple governments and financial institutions exploring CBDC frameworks , and XRP is often positioned as a solution for fast, secure, and cost-efficient transactions. While the discussion at Money20/20 was not exclusively centered on Ripple, its inclusion in the list of companies described as heavyweights signals that traditional financial players are acknowledging its presence in the broader conversation. XRP’s Increasing Prominence in Global Finance The acknowledgement from JP Morgan comes at a time when the CBDC race is accelerating worldwide. According to the data previously shared by SMQKE, 3 countries, including Nigeria, Jamaica, and the Bahamas, have already launched national digital currencies.

Exploring Ripple’s Pre-Mined Model,https://coinpaper.com/10829/can-you-mine-xrp-exploring-ripple-s-pre-mined-model,"Can XRP Be Mined? The Short Answer The simple answer is no — XRP cannot be mined. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum (pre-Merge), which use Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to validate transactions and mint new coins, XRP was fully created at its inception. Ripple Labs pre-mined 100 billion XRP tokens in 2012, and no new XRP can be created beyond that fixed supply. This design is intentional. Ripple’s goal was to create a fast, scalable, and energy-efficient digital currency for cross-border payments and enterprise use, without relying on mining networks that consume massive electricity. How XRP Is Distributed Even though XRP cannot be mined, it’s gradually released into circulation through several mechanisms: Ripple Escrow – ~55 billion XRP is held in escrow accounts, with 1 billion XRP released monthly to ensure predictable market supply. Ripple Treasury & Operations – Ripple retains a portion for partnerships, liquidity provision, and operational expenses. Sales to Investors – Ripple sells XRP to institutional and retail investors via exchanges and OTC deals. This controlled release helps avoid flooding the market, keeping the XRP ecosystem stable while supporting adoption. XRP vs. Bitcoin: Key Differences Feature XRP Bitcoin Total Supply 100B XRP (pre-mined) 21M BTC (mined gradually) Mining None Proof-of-Work Energy Use Minimal High energy consumption Transaction Speed 3–5 seconds 10+ minutes Ledger XRP Ledger Bitcoin blockchain Ripple’s pre-mined model eliminates mining fees, reduces transaction costs, and enables near-instant settlements, making XRP ideal for cross-border payments. Why XRP Isn’t Mineable Matters for Investors Predictable Supply – No inflation from new mining, unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum. Low Energy Footprint – XRP is environmentally friendly compared to energy-intensive PoW coins. Controlled Distribution – Ripple can manage supply and liquidity via escrow releases. Investors often confuse XRP with mineable cryptocurrencies. Understanding this distinction is key for portfolio strategy, risk assessment, and evaluating long-term supply dynamics. Myths About XRP Mining “ I can mine XRP on my PC ” – False. XRP uses a consensus algorithm (Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm), not mining. “ XRP can be mined like Bitcoin ” – False. All 100 billion XRP were created at launch. “Holding XRP is like staking a mined coin ” – False. XRP holders can stake via third-party platforms, but this doesn’t generate new XRP. The Role of XRP Ledger XRP Ledger (XRPL) uses a consensus protocol to validate transactions without mining. Validators — independent nodes around the world — agree on transaction order in seconds. This allows: Fast transactions (~3–5 seconds) Low transaction fees ( Secure and decentralized consensus By eliminating mining, XRP avoids the energy drain and bottlenecks seen in PoW networks. Final Thoughts In short, XRP cannot be mined, and that’s by design. Ripple’s pre-mined, escrow-controlled supply ensures fast transactions, low fees, and predictable market behavior. For investors, knowing that XRP is pre-mined highlights its stability, scalability, and environmental efficiency — all reasons why Ripple focuses on enterprise adoption and cross-border payments.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MINING|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-01 19:04:17

XRP and Pi Coin remain familiar names, yet both face structural limitations that could restrict near-term upside. On the other hand, Remittix ($RTX) has not only secured exchange listings but also carved out real-world adoption paths in global payments. With analysts forecasting possible 20x gains this month, Remittix is increasingly viewed as the top contender for those seeking explosive returns. XRP Shows Steady Progress, But Growth Remains Capped XRP continues to capture attention as Ripple expands its partnerships in cross-border settlements. Current forecasts suggest XRP could hold between $2.80 and $3.20 by the end of the year, supported by ongoing institutional adoption. Compared with newer tokens targeting underserved markets, XRP’s reliance on regulatory progress leaves many investors considering alternatives under the Best Crypto To Buy Now category. Pi Coin Faces Questions Over Utility And Future Adoption Pi Coin has built a massive community of users, many of whom continue to mine through its mobile application. Yet despite years of anticipation, clear timelines for full mainnet adoption and real-world use remain uncertain. For investors evaluating the best crypto to buy now, the lack of clear infrastructure or utility makes Pi Coin less appealing than tokens already demonstrating measurable adoption. Remittix Emerges As The Best Crypto To Buy Now In contrast to XRP’s slower growth path and Pi Coin’s uncertainty, Remittix has positioned itself as the practical choice for rapid gains. At $0.1000 per token, Remittix has sold more than 637 million tokens and raised over $23 million. It passed the $20 million mark to secure its first CEX listing on BitMart and crossed $22 million to confirm a second listing on LBANK. Alongside these milestones, the project is launching its wallet beta this quarter and rewarding its community with a $250,000 giveaway. These factors explain why analysts see Remittix not just as another token, but as the best crypto to buy now with 20x upside potential. Here are standout reasons backing its rise: Solving a $19 trillion payments problem through PayFi infrastructure Crypto to bank transfers across 30+ countries are already in motion Built for real adoption, not just speculative demand Audited by CertiK to ensure security and transparency Positioned ahead of wallet rollout and broader listings momentum With Remittix building adoption layers step by step, its probability of delivering 20x returns appears stronger than both XRP and Pi Coin. Why Remittix Could Be the Breakthrough Pick of the Month When weighing XRP, Pi Coin, and Remittix, the question of the best crypto to buy now comes down to utility and growth trajectory. XRP remains relevant but constrained by regulation. Pi Coin holds community support yet lacks tangible adoption. Remittix, by comparison, combines exchange traction, wallet launch, and real-world payment use cases into a compelling growth story. With over $23 million raised and analysts projecting 20x potential, Remittix is emerging as the token that could define this month’s standout opportunity.

Traders who once backed Ripple (XRP) are now moving funds into projects showing stronger momentum. Solana (SOL) has become a top pick, while presale token Layer Brett (LBRETT) is drawing big attention with its mix of meme appeal and technical depth. The trend shows where many believe the next gains will come as 2025 approaches. Solana keeps attracting buyers Solana built its name on speed and low fees. That formula has made it a favorite for developers in DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. The chain regularly handles millions of transactions, proving it can run at scale while keeping costs predictable. On price, SOL is trading near $200, with traders watching for a possible breakout higher. Analysts say the steady volume suggests buyers are happy to accumulate at current levels. Large funds are also adding exposure, giving Solana more credibility as a long-term play. Developers continue to launch projects on the network, showing confidence in its stability. Even when other chains slow, Solana has kept activity high. This consistency is why it’s often seen as the strongest alternative to Ethereum outside of Bitcoin. Ripple struggles to hold interest XRP is still one of the biggest coins by market cap, but it hasn’t matched the pace of others. The XRP Price is sitting around $2.80, with repeated attempts to push higher meeting resistance. For many traders, that level has become a ceiling. The ongoing SEC case has also limited momentum. While Ripple’s payment system is used in cross-border transfers, it hasn’t translated into fresh demand for the token itself. Some analysts argue XRP now acts more like a utility coin than a high-growth asset. With limited upside, investors looking for quick gains are shifting their focus elsewhere. Why Layer Brett is gaining attention The project many are rotating into is Layer Brett ($LBRETT). It’s a meme token but built on Ethereum Layer 2, giving it real scalability and very low fees. That structure makes it more usable than older meme plays that relied only on hype. The presale is priced near $0.005 and offering staking rewards in the thousands of percent APY. That combination has sparked strong demand, with both small buyers and larger holders jumping in. Community activity on Telegram and X has been growing fast, adding to the hype. Beyond the early buzz, the team has mapped out features to keep people engaged after launch. These include NFT integrations, gamified staking models, and plans for cross-chain use. With a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens, scarcity is built into the system, something traders see as key for long-term growth. Many now compare Layer Brett’s setup to the early days of Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, but with stronger infrastructure behind it. Final thoughts The shift away from XRP and toward Solana and Layer Brett reflects a clear trend. Traders want either stability with upside or early-stage tokens with explosive potential. Solana offers proven adoption, growing institutional support, and a reliable developer base. Layer Brett delivers meme energy backed by Ethereum Layer 2 utility and rewards that encourage early participation. For investors, the choice is about risk tolerance. Solana can provide steady growth in the large-cap space, while Layer Brett offers high-risk, high-reward potential in presale. With XRP stuck in place, the market focus is moving quickly to the coins that look ready to lead in 2025.

51031622,https://invezz.com/?p=2858065,1756754217,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Metaplanet secures $884M share sale amid intensifying Bitcoin strategy scrutiny,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/01/metaplanet-secures-884m-share-sale-amid-intensifying-bitcoin-strategy-scrutiny/,"Metaplanet Inc., the Tokyo-based firm that has reinvented itself from a struggling hotel operator into one of the world’s largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, has secured shareholder approval to raise up to $884 million through an overseas share sale. The move underscores both the company’s aggressive expansion strategy and the growing questions over the sustainability of its approach. Shareholders back capital raise and governance changes At an extraordinary general meeting in Tokyo, Metaplanet shareholders approved three key resolutions: an increase in the number of authorized shares, the introduction of virtual shareholder meetings, and new provisions for perpetual preferred shares. The new capital-raising plan will see the company issue 550 million new shares, raising about 130.3 billion yen ($884 million). Management confirmed that most of the proceeds will be directed toward additional cryptocurrency purchases. The announcement came alongside news that Metaplanet added 1,009 Bitcoin to its holdings on Monday, bringing its total to 20,000 coins worth more than $2 billion. This purchase cements its position as the sixth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin globally, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net. Financing strategy faces mounting pressure Metaplanet’s expansion has been funded in part through “moving strike warrants” issued to Evo Fund, a mechanism CEO Gerovich dubbed the “flywheel.” The model enabled the firm to raise capital at low cost while its share price was climbing. However, the approach has faltered in recent months as Metaplanet’s stock has retreated. After soaring more than 740% over the past year, the company’s shares have fallen 54% since peaking in mid-June, even as Bitcoin prices rose modestly over the same period. As the stock declined, warrant exercises generated less cash, slowing the pace of accumulation. Analysts have also pointed to a narrowing of Metaplanet’s so-called “Bitcoin premium”—the gap between its market capitalization and the value of its holdings. Once at more than eight times reserves in June, the multiple has since compressed to around two. “The Bitcoin premium is what drives the success of the entire strategy,” said Natixis analyst Eric Benoist. “If the premium compresses, they can’t accumulate on the same terms, interest wanes, and the stock goes down.” Long-term targets and growing investor base To ease financing constraints, Metaplanet has proposed issuing up to 555 million preferred shares, potentially raising as much as ¥555 billion ($3.8 billion). These securities would carry dividends of up to 6% and be capped at 25% of the value of Bitcoin holdings. CEO Gerovich described the move as a “defensive mechanism” to protect common shareholders from dilution while keeping pace with global Bitcoin accumulation. Despite the volatility, the company’s long-term ambitions remain bold. Metaplanet aims to grow its Bitcoin treasury to 100,000 coins by the end of next year and 210,000 coins by 2027—around 1% of total global supply. In the second quarter of 2025 alone, it reported a 468% yield on its Bitcoin holdings, generating ¥816 million in operating profit and ¥1,239 million in revenue. Shareholder interest has surged alongside these developments, with the number of investors rising more than 1,000% in a year to 128,000. Metaplanet now ranks among Asia’s most closely watched corporate Bitcoin holders, though analysts caution that its accumulation strategy could face limits if market conditions compress its premium further.

51031175,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=796819,1756754431,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51031175.jpeg,A study warns that stricter immigration enforcement could cost California up to $278 billion in GDP,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/californias-4-trillion-economy-at-risk-amid-immigration-crackdown/,"A new analysis says tougher federal enforcement could hurt the industries that power California’s $4 trillion economy, as it is dependent on immigrant workers. Researchers identify agriculture, construction, and hospitality as the most exposed if immigrant workers depart. The stakes reach across California, whose economy on its own ranks fourth worldwide, behind the United States, China, and Germany. A June review by the Bay Area Economic Institute and UC Merced estimates that roughly one in five of the state’s 10.6 million foreign-born residents lack legal status. If broad removals coincide with ending temporary protected status for thousands and tighter border rules, the study projects California could see as much as $278 billion shaved from gross domestic product. With fewer births and an aging population, immigrants have stepped into essential roles, said Abby Raisz, research director at the Bay Area Economic Institute. “These are the workers that are keeping our economy afloat. They’re keeping businesses open,” Raisz told CNBC. California farms rely heavily on immigrant labor That dependence is most obvious in the fields where crops are planted, tended, and picked, according to researchers and advocates. Farming generates about $49 billion a year in California and, among state industries, employs the highest share of immigrant and undocumented labor. The Bay Area Council report finds that 63% of farmworkers are immigrants and 24% are undocumented. “Without them, we wouldn’t have any food available,” said Joe Garcia, president of the California Farmworker Association and CEO of Jaguar Labor Contracting, which connects workers with growers. “The lettuce, the strawberries, all the wine we drink on a daily basis, fruit juices– everything that a farmworker picks, packs, pre-harvest– they do the jobs all year round that put food on your table,” he said. Garcia said many tasks resist automation and that U.S.-born workers rarely seek strenuous, lower-paid outdoor jobs. Trump prioritizes citizen jobs over immigrant labor The White House says the labor market can handle a smaller immigrant workforce and that its priority is jobs for citizens . “Over one in ten young adults in America are neither employed, in higher education, nor pursuing some sort of vocational training,” said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson in response to an inquiry about potential effects on California and its key industries. He added, “There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force, and President Trump’s agenda to create jobs for American workers represents this Administration’s commitment to capitalizing on that untapped potential while delivering on our mandate to enforce our immigration laws.” In downtown Los Angeles, business owners reported ripple effects beginning in June and continuing afterward. They cite highly publicized ICE operations, protests, and National Guard deployments that unsettled staff and customers and reinforced worries about safety. Labor shortages predate recent policy debates. In California, immigrants make up more than 60% of construction workers, and about one-quarter lack legal status, the Bay Area Council report notes. “There are profound skill shortages in these production industries, construction, manufacturing, because culturally, we have not created enough of these workers,” said Anirban Basu, chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors. Basu said some contractors think the administration’s plan will bring more investment and jobs. Others worry about higher costs and unclear rules. Even so, California’s housing shortage means builders are still needed. “Even during tough economic times, it’s in the midst of transformation,” he said.

Data from the Tokenomist website shows significant cliff unlocks for Ethereum Name Service (ENS), Immutable X (IMX), and Elixir (ELX), alongside daily linear distributions impacting heavyweights like Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Avalanche (AVAX). Unlocks Add Supply Pressure Across Key Projects ENS leads this week’s unlocks, with about $213 million worth of tokens scheduled to hit the market, an amount that makes up just over 3% of its circulating supply. It is followed by IMX with an upcoming release valued at about $55 million, accounting for slightly more than 1%of its supply. Among projects experiencing steady daily linear releases, Solana will see close to $100 million added to its supply, while the Worldcoin project is set to make available around $32 million worth of its native WLD token. Meanwhile, DOGE will activate more than 96 million new coins valued at $19.79 million, with Celestia preparing to introduce an additional 6.96 million TIA tokens priced at about $13 million. Avalanche will also expand its supply by roughly $16 million, and Sui will contribute 3.01 million coins worth just under $10 million. Combined, these events form part of the broader $4.7 billion in token unlocks expected throughout September. Historically, cliff unlocks often lead to volatility when sudden supply hits the market without matching demand. On the other hand, linear schedules can provide a more gradual release, and with multiple high-value unlocks overlapping this week, traders are advised to keep an eye out for short-term turbulence, especially in lower-liquidity tokens. Market Impact: Eyes on Solana and Dogecoin Solana stands out as both a beneficiary of bullish technical momentum and a project facing a notable unlock. As recently reported by CryptoPotato , on-chain data shows nearly $4 billion worth of SOL accumulated around $180, with additional treasury purchases adding support. Analysts suggest the golden cross could fuel further upside if buying pressure absorbs the fresh supply, though resistance near $0.002 BTC remains a test. Elsewhere, Dogecoin’s outlook is less clear. The OG meme coin is consolidating below $0.23, a breakout level that analyst Ali Martinez has flagged as pivotal for short-term rallies. And with close to $20 million in new tokens entering circulation this week, the added supply could weigh on the asset unless bullish sentiment returns.

The metric also correlates with the growth of BTC, which is often seen as an alternative to a debased currency. The US M2 money supply reached a new peak at the end of August, with $22.13 trillion reported as of August 26. The next reporting period is expected in a month. The M2 metric is up from $22.02T at the end of July, with a slow trend of expansion. M2 broad money kept growing, adding $1T in the past year, with gradual monthly expansion. The metric is watched for its potential to precede BTC rallies, based on inflows of liquidity in the US and the global economy. | Source: Trading Economics Since August 2024, the M2 metric has grown without stopping, adding another $1T to the bottom line. At the same time, BTC prices closely tracked the liquidity expansion, reaching an all-time peak above $124,000. The July bull market also rode on the back of another monthly uptick in M2, as Cryptopolitan previously reported . With another monthly expansion, BTC can fluctuate around its close M2 correlation. Usually, BTC has up to 90 days of lag when tracking the M2 chart. During correction periods, BTC lags behind M2, but catches up with the trend . The 2021 crypto boom also coincided with one of the most rapid M2 expansions in the past five years. Global money supply also boosts BTC The global money supply also expanded actively in 2025, with increased liquidity in China and 19 other central banks. Since January, the M2 global supply added $7T, for a total of 112T . The expansion of BTC in the past three months followed the active growth stage of the global M2, once again showing a pattern of tracking the additional liquidity. BTC also rises in correlation with stablecoin inflows, but those also reflect the overall market confidence and the trends of liquidity seeking new forms of investment. The M2 correlation, however, mostly holds during bull cycle phases. The relatively high M2 supply in 2022 and 2023 did not prevent a relatively long bear market, which was caused by internal crypto events. BTC tracks global asset expansion The BTC correlation to low interest rates and growing liquidity also means the asset tracks both gold and the S&P500 index. During the latest expansion, all three asset types retained a common trend. BTC, for now, does not outperform other asset classes, despite short-term historical rallies above the trend of stocks. BTC currently stands at $109,175, showing a gap with stocks and the latest additions to the M2 global and US-based supply. Historically, this gap between the BTC value and the M2 growth has set up expectations for sparking a new rally in the coming months. M2 is watched to determine the potential cycle peak for BTC. Currently, BTC is still close to its all-time high, but there are expectations for a year-end rally and new price records. BTC still faces pressures from crypto insiders, and may not track the M2 metric as closely during periods of increased turbulence. Despite this, M2 is watched for its general trend and the long-term effect on all markets. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Analyst Shares 3 Possible Scenarios,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-bitcoin-btc-dominance-decline-will-it-trigger-an-altcoin-season-analyst-shares-3-possible-scenarios/,"Cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen made remarkable predictions about Bitcoin (BTC) and the altcoin market in his latest published assessment. According to Cowen, BTC dominance may soon find the bottom and enter an uptrend again. Cowen stated that the Bitcoin price faces three possible scenarios in the coming period, and that all of these scenarios have historically increased BTC dominance: If BTC Takes Support from 20-Week Moving Average (20W SMA) Cowen stated that if Bitcoin gains support from this average and begins to rise, it will lead to a bull market and BTC dominance will increase. He argued that this scenario could be similar to what happened in 2017. BTC Fails to Hold 20-Week Moving Average (20W SMA) and Falls to 50-Week Moving Average According to the analyst, such a scenario could seriously impact altcoins. “If BTC drops by 10%, most altcoins would lose more than 30% of their value,” Cowen said, adding that this could raise concerns about the health of the bull market. Related News: Experienced Expert Shares Key Level for Bitcoin Price: “As Long as It Stays Below This Level, Bears Will Dominate the Market” If BTC Stays Sideways Above 20W SMA Throughout September Cowen stated that altcoins will gradually lose value in this case, and that BTC dominance will increase again. He drew attention to a similar scenario that occurred in 2020. Cowen concluded: “Whichever direction BTC/USD moves, it's likely that BTC dominance will bottom out and begin to rise very soon. We're at the beginning of the last major rotation into Bitcoin in this market cycle.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Will Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance Decline?

This listing makes Pi available in more than 60 countries. This listing also adds local payment options, making it easier for users to buy Pi in their own currency. However, the news did not boost the token’s price, which remains weak in the market. Pi Network Gets Wider Access On September 1, Pi Network confirmed its link with Onramp Money. This means users can now buy Pi directly using familiar payment methods in their country. Supported options include GCash, Maya, and Alipay, giving Pi holders the ability to buy in their native currencies . Onramp also advised buyers to drop their Pi wallet addresses to avoid failed purchases. This listing represents one of the largest fiat-to-Pi withdrawal channels so far, which is set to improve both liquidity and availability of the token. For Pi’s growing community, the development makes acquiring tokens more convenient and more aligned with everyday financial spending. Pi Network Takes A Measured Approach to Distribution The blockchain project says it is following a controlled distribution plan. Dr. Altcoin, a popular crypto analyst, said that Pi will not release too many tokens on centralized exchanges. Tokens will be issued directly from Pi’s foundation wallets to verified onramp partners. Analysts note that this design avoids oversupply and supports steady ecosystem growth. According to Dr. Altcoin, the goal is not short-term speculation but long-term use. Pi Network is aiming to attract users who will actively use Pi for apps, payments, services, and peer-to-peer transactions rather than just trading. Meanwhile, Pi Network is not expanding access through Onramp Money. It has formed partnerships with platforms like TransFi and Branx. Together, these companies work in about 100 countries and offer over 170 ways to pay. Additionally, this collaboration is poised to help Pi stay aligned with regulatory standards while reaching new markets. Pi Token Market Performance Remains Flat Even with the Onramp Money listing, Pi’s market performance has stayed negative. The token, which is expected to surge in 2026 , dropped 4.52% in the past 24 hours, trading at $0.3441. Over the last month, Pi fell 7.57%, and over the last six months, it has declined by 80.98%, according to TradingView data. Market charts show that Pi touched $0.35 for a short time but then dropped again. Sellers’ activity remained high, and weak demand stopped any strong recovery. On the bright side, the launch of the first Pi Network Exchange Traded Product (ETP) in Europe is a good sign. It shows that bigger investors are starting to take an interest in Pi. With the ETP launch and the new listing, Pi is expected to gain more adoption, which could help its price in the future.

This futuristic vision is now a reality as RAK Properties, a prominent real estate developer listed in the UAE emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, officially begins accepting crypto payments for its properties. This groundbreaking move signals a significant shift in how property transactions are conducted, opening new avenues for investors worldwide. What Does Accepting Crypto Payments Mean for Property Buyers? This innovative step fundamentally simplifies the purchasing process, especially for a global clientele. RAK Properties will now accept major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT). The actual processing of these crypto payments is meticulously handled by Hubpay, a specialized and regulated payment gateway. Hubpay’s role is crucial: it seamlessly converts the crypto assets into the UAE’s national fiat currency, the Dirham (AED), before securely depositing the funds to RAK Properties. This instant conversion mechanism effectively shields both the buyer and the seller from direct cryptocurrency price volatility, ensuring a stable transaction. For buyers, the benefits are clear: Global Accessibility: Attracts international investors who hold significant wealth in digital assets. Streamlined Transactions: Offers a faster, more efficient payment method than traditional international bank transfers. Potential for Reduced Fees: Transaction costs can sometimes be lower compared to conventional banking methods for cross-border payments. Why are Crypto Payments Gaining Traction in Real Estate? The real estate sector, historically cautious, is increasingly recognizing the potential of digital currencies. The inherent transparency and robust security of blockchain technology, which underpins all cryptocurrencies, offer compelling advantages. When crypto payments are utilized, every transaction is immutably recorded on a distributed ledger, significantly enhancing trust and reducing potential fraud. Moreover, the ability to transact 24/7, without being constrained by traditional banking hours, provides unparalleled convenience. This flexibility is particularly appealing to a global market seeking efficiency. Enhanced Security and Transparency: Blockchain ensures verifiable, tamper-proof records. Unmatched Speed and Efficiency: Transactions can be processed in minutes, not days, especially across international borders. Attracting a New Generation of Investors: This move strategically taps into the burgeoning wealth held by crypto-savvy individuals. How Does Hubpay Facilitate These Seamless Crypto Payments? Hubpay serves as the indispensable bridge between the dynamic world of digital assets and established traditional finance. When a property buyer initiates a payment using their BTC, ETH, or USDT, Hubpay immediately steps in. It handles the swift and secure conversion of these cryptocurrencies into UAE Dirhams (AED) at competitive market rates. This critical step ensures that RAK Properties receives its funds directly in fiat currency, thereby completely mitigating any direct exposure to the inherent volatility of the crypto market. This seamless conversion service is paramount, ensuring that both the buyer and the seller can confidently engage in these high-value transactions. They know the entire financial process is robust, compliant, and secure. This mechanism is indeed a key enabler for the widespread adoption of crypto payments within established industries like real estate. What are the Broader Implications for the UAE and the Market? RAK Properties’ pioneering decision to embrace crypto payments strategically positions the UAE, and particularly Ras Al Khaimah, as a visionary and forward-thinking hub for innovation. This bold move could encourage other prominent developers and businesses across the region to explore similar digital payment solutions, fostering a more dynamic and technologically advanced economy. Furthermore, it strongly signals the UAE’s unwavering commitment to becoming a global leader in the digital economy. Such initiatives actively attract crypto-savvy investors and top-tier talent from around the world. The successful integration of digital assets into tangible asset purchases like real estate represents a significant milestone in the maturing global crypto ecosystem. Innovation Leadership: Reinforces the UAE’s reputation as a tech-forward and progressive nation. Economic Diversification: Attracts new forms of capital and investment, broadening the economic base. Increased Investor Confidence: Legitimizes cryptocurrency as a viable and secure payment method for high-value assets. Navigating the Future of Real Estate with Crypto Payments While the adoption of crypto payments in real estate offers numerous compelling benefits, it is also important to acknowledge certain considerations. The market volatility of cryptocurrencies remains a key factor, although Hubpay’s instant conversion service significantly helps to mitigate this risk for the seller. Regulatory clarity continues to evolve globally, and the UAE has been commendably proactive in establishing clear frameworks and guidelines for digital assets. Moreover, comprehensive education for both buyers and sellers on the process, security protocols, and any associated risks is paramount for ensuring smooth and transparent transactions. However, the overarching trend undeniably points towards increasing acceptance and deeper integration of digital currencies into mainstream commerce, with the real estate sector emerging as a leading example of this transformative shift. Conclusion: A New Era for Property Transactions RAK Properties’ bold and strategic step to accept crypto payments marks a truly pivotal moment for the UAE real estate market and the broader cryptocurrency landscape. By proactively embracing digital assets, they are not only catering to a modern, digitally native class of investors but also setting a powerful precedent for innovation, accessibility, and efficiency within the property sector. This forward-thinking move underscores the growing confidence in cryptocurrencies as legitimate, secure, and efficient tools for high-value transactions. It paves the way for a more digitally integrated, globally connected, and accessible property market. The future of real estate is undeniably becoming more digital, and the UAE is confidently leading this exciting charge.

51032367,570545,1756756813,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51032367.jpeg,What Does AMM Liquidity Pools Mean For XRP And RLUSD Holders? Ripple Exec Answers,https://bitcoinist.com/amm-liquidity-pools-for-xrp/,"Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz , has clarified for XRP and RLUSD holders the workings of Automated Market Maker (AMM) liquidity pools . Schwartz has explained how these pools balance assets, generate value, and offer new opportunities for holders to engage with the cryptocurrency while benefiting from shifts in market activity. AMM Liquidity Pools Explained For XRP And RLUSD Holders AMM liquidity pools are increasingly becoming a key area of interest as XRP and RLUSD holders search for newer, smarter ways to leverage their assets. A recent post on X social media from a crypto member inquired about how these pools operate, prompting Schwartz to clarify the mechanics and benefits for users participating in them. Essentially, an AMM liquidity pool holds two assets, in this case XRP and RLUSD, in roughly equal value. It also issues liquidity tokens representing a proportional claim against the pool’s total assets. According to Schwartz, these tokens allow holders to benefit from the pool’s growth over time while providing liquidity for traders who want to exchange XRP and RLUSD. The Ripple CTO revealed that the mechanism behind the AMM liquidity pool ensures that it maintains balance regardless of XRP’s price fluctuations . For instance, if the value of XRP falls, the pool automatically converts RLUSD into XRP to equalize the values. Conversely, if XRP rises, the excess token is converted to RLUSD. Schwartz noted that this intricate balance is maintained through a value known as the “pool constant,” calculated by multiplying the number of XRP and RLUSD in the pool and dividing by the total liquidity tokens issued. He further explained that the pool is designed to increase this constant over time, which theoretically could steadily boost the value of each liquidity token, even during periods of volatility in XRP . In other words, RLUSD and XRP holders who participate in the pool may see their assets appreciate over time , offering a potential advantage beyond simply holding the tokens. Notably, the Ripple CTO emphasized that liquidity tokens can also gain value from transaction fees collected when other traders use the pool to exchange XRP for RLUSD, providing another potential source of profit for token holders. While the assets remain exposed to fluctuations in XRP’s market price, these effects are generally less pronounced than just holding the cryptocurrency. Liquidity Provider Concerns And Profit Distribution Despite the advantages, some crypto community members have raised concerns about how AMM liquidity pools distribute profits. One crypto member asked whether transaction fees generated by the pool could be segregated and accumulated in RLUSD to generate more stable, predictable returns for Liquidity Providers (LP) . Schwartz responded , explaining that Ripple’s current pool design assumes that liquidity providers primarily want to hold XRP long-term and profit from its price swings. As a result, profits are directly tied to XRP’s market movements, meaning a decline could reduce the value of LP tokens and accumulated fees and vice versa.",XRP|AMM|Automated Market Maker|David Schwartz|Liquidity Providers|LP|ripple|ripple news|RLUSD|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MINING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-01 20:00:13

This event contradicted the long-standing belief that the token’s supply was fixed and that rebasing had been disabled. After reviewing the incident, developers and the community agreed that LEASH v2 would be launched under a new audited non-rebase contract. Shiba Inu developers noted that work on LEASH v2 is already underway. The stated goal is to provide a secure migration process, with full verification and protections for token holders. At the same time, the team emphasized that any announcements about LEASH migration outside the official SHIB website should be treated as scams. Warnings Against False Claims Susbarium also pointed out that coordinated groups of bad actors are spreading misinformation across social media through networks of fake accounts. These efforts, according to the watchdog, are aimed at creating confusion and preying on less experienced investors. The Shiba Inu team has made clear there is no official LEASH token on Solana. Claims of migration to that blockchain are fraudulent, and any Solana-based version of LEASH is fake. Only tokens listed on the official SHIB website are valid parts of the ecosystem, the team stated.

The chart he posted details expectations for the September 17 Federal Open Market Committee meeting. According to the data, there is an 89.7% probability that the Fed will lower the target range to 400-425 basis points, compared to the current 425-450. Only 10.3% of market participants anticipate rates remaining at existing levels. The chart illustrates a decisive tilt in market sentiment toward rate cuts, reflecting widespread anticipation that policymakers will ease borrowing costs after maintaining these rates for an extended period.

A reduction typically makes borrowing cheaper, encourages liquidity, and can put pressure on the U.S. dollar.
