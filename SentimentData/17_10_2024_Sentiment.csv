34787287,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648286,1729116012,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/34787287.jpeg,"Bitcoin Clears $65,000: Can The Bulls Push BTC To Historic Heights?",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/can-the-bulls-push-bitcoin-to-historic-heights/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has made a bold move, breaking past the crucial $65,000 level and sparking renewed hope of reaching its all-time high. As bullish momentum builds, the market is watching closely to see if this breakthrough could be the start of a larger rally. With previous resistance now behind it, can Bitcoin continue its upward journey and reclaim its record peak? Or will market forces pull it back before reaching new heights? The aim of this article is to explore BTC’s impressive move past the $65,000 level and evaluate its prospects of hitting a new peak. This piece will offer a comprehensive outlook on whether BTC can sustain its rally or face resistance as it approaches record territory through a detailed look at current market dynamics, rising power, and potential challenges. What Breaking The $65,000 Barrier Means For Bitcoin Currently, on the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin is sustaining its position after successfully surpassing the $65,000 mark while trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). By maintaining its position above the $65,000 mark and the 100-day SMA, BTC demonstrates resilience and potential for further upward momentum toward its all-time high of $73,811. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a significant surge, climbing to 77% after dropping to 50%, indicating strong bullish pressure for Bitcoin. While this increase signals growing positive market sentiment, it also raises concerns about the sustainability of the rally, as a possible price correction could occur if profit-taking ensues.

Furthermore, the daily chart indicates that Bitcoin is trading above the 100-day SMA, which is a strong signal of upbeat momentum. This upward movement is marked by a rebound at the $65,000 level, demonstrating significant buying interest from investors. The fact that BTC is consistently above the 100-day SMA suggests a solid trend and that the bulls are eager to push prices higher, potentially leading to more upside movement if pressure continues to build. Lastly, the RSI on the daily chart is currently positioned at 66%, significantly above the pivotal 50% threshold, which indicates a bullish trend for Bitcoin. At 66%, the RSI indicates that BTC’s positive pressure will likely persist, supporting the possibility of continued price gains in the near term as it has not yet reached the overbought territory. Technical Outlook: What Charts Indicate About BTC’s Next Move A technical outlook for Bitcoin indicates a cautiously optimistic trajectory as the cryptocurrency maintains its position above key support levels. Thus, the next resistance level to monitor is its current all-time high of $73,811. A successful breach above this level could pave the way for Bitcoin to reach new heights, potentially setting the stage for a new record. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Restarts Its Climb: Is The Rally Back On? However, if bears take control at the $73,811 resistance level, the price may start to decline toward the $65,00 support range. Additionally, a drop below this level could trigger a deeper decline, possibly leading to a test of the $60,000 support level and beyond.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Currently Inside The Greed Region The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. This index makes use of the data of the following five factors in order to determine the sentiment: trading volume, volatility, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends. Once found, it represents the market mentality as a score between 0 and 100. When the metric has a value greater than 53, it means the traders as a whole share a sentiment of greed right now. On the other hand, it being under the 47 mark implies the dominance of fear in the market. The territory in-between these two corresponds to a net neutral mentality. Related Reading: Ethereum Open Interest Sees Fastest Rise In 5 Months: Brace For More Volatility? Besides these three main sentiment zones, there are also two special regions called the extreme fear and the extreme greed. The former of these occurs at 25 and under, while the latter at 75 and above. Now, here is what the latest value of the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has been like: As is visible above, the indicator has a value of 73, which suggests that the investors are currently showing a significant amount of greed. This is a notable change from how the mood in the market was last week, as the index had declined into the fear zone then. The below chart shows how the value of the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has changed over the past year: From the graph, it’s visible that this latest uplift in the sentiment, which has come as a result of the asset’s rally to $68,000, has taken the index to the highest value since the end of July. Back then, the high sentiment values had led to a top for the cryptocurrency. This type of pattern is something that has actually been witnessed throughout history. It turns out that Bitcoin has a tendency to move in the direction opposite to what the crowd is expecting and the probability of such a contrary move increases the more the traders lean towards one side. In the extreme regions, this likelihood is the strongest, so tops and bottoms have often formed when the investors have shared these sentiments. The current value of the index is just outside the extreme greed zone, so a top could become likely for the asset should the investor mentality continue to improve. Related Reading: Bitcoin Analyst Reveals Best On-Chain Metric For ‘Day-To-Day Trading’ The sentiment may also not even have to improve further for such a scenario to follow out, as the top back in July had occurred when the index had a value of 74, only one unit greater than the current one. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $68,000, up more than 9% over the last week.

Amidst this bearish development, a crypto analyst remains optimistic about Dogecoin’s price outlook, believing that it can reach new All-Time Highs (ATH) of $10 soon. Dogecoin Holder Base Sees Rapid Decline Santiment, a Market Intelligence platform has unveiled a rather bearish trend involving Dogecoin investors and holders. The platform revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post on October 15 that the number of active Dogecoin holders is falling at a significantly rapid pace. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stochastic Breakout Puts BTC Price Above $500,000, Here’s When Based on its reports, there has been a net loss of approximately 106,600 non-empty wallets since Tuesday, October 8. A non-empty wallet here refers to a crypto wallet that contains at least some DOGE tokens. Sharing a chart illustrating the decline in the Dogecoin holder base, Santiment revealed that the total number of Dogecoin holders is estimated currently at 6.62 million. This figure marks the lowest the DOGE holder base has ever been since April 25, 2024. The net drop of 160,600 indicates that more people are either selling off or withdrawing the DOGE tokens from their wallets than those buying the meme coin. In light of this, Santiment has noted a shift in investors’ sentiment and interest in Dogecoin. The market intelligence platform has disclosed that many traders who had invested in Dogecoin are expressing frustration about the meme coin’s poor market performance. As a result, traders, especially those looking for short-term gains, are moving away from Dogecoin in search of a cryptocurrency that might offer rapid price increases. As of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.12, experiencing slight upticks over the weeks, according to CoinMarketCap. It appears the meme coin’s 10% surge and 17% increase in the past week and month respectively, has not been enough for many investors. As the top meme coin in the market, many expect a dramatic DOGE surge to occur in order to reap immense benefits. However, the cryptocurrency’s recent fluctuating performance and inability to reach the coveted $1 mark has left many investors concerned. Analyst Doubles Down On $10 Price Target For DOGE Amidst the decline in the Dogecoin holder base, a crypto analyst remains highly bullish on the meme coin price outlook. Dima James Potts, an analyst on X has doubled down on his earlier prediction that Dogecoin is headed to $10. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Identifies Bull Flag That Could Send Solana Price To $1,400 In a previous X post on August 8, Potts predicted that Dogecoin is gearing up for a major price increase in 2025. At the time, the analyst based his forecast on DOGE’s historical patterns and past performance, highlighting that in the two previous market cycles, Dogecoin had surged 9,000% and 18,000% in 2017, and 2021 respectively. Now the analyst is reinforcing his earlier prediction, emphasizing that history cannot be changed, while asserting that a $10 price surge for Dogecoin was seemingly inevitable.

BTC is currently up ~52% year-to-date. Ether's price climbed higher, ending above $2,600. ETH is now up ~11% year-to-date. XRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. XRP is currently down ~14% year-to-date. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. While both are considered to be high risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Bitcoin's price climbed above the $60,000 level this past week. BTC is currently up ~52% year-to-date. Ether Ether ( ETH-USD ) is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second-largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article, with its launch in July 2015. Ether's price climbed higher, ending above $2,600. ETH is now up ~11% year-to-date. XRP XRP ( XRP-USD ), which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We've included it in this article for reference. XRP is currently down ~14% year-to-date. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Bitcoin tops the chart. In other words, the price of a bitcoin has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies. On January 10th, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

It finished the week at its all-time high price of $2.30 and ranked higher than top altcoins such as Polkadot (DOT), therefore ranking itself among the top 15 cryptocurrencies. Among those who support SUI, this achievement has inspired hope since they believe it will become a major competitor in the market.

Congrats to those that listened to me. pic.twitter.com/FtU5vk8f8M — MartyParty (@martypartymusic) October 13, 2024 At the time of writing, SUI was trading at $2.04, down 4.3% in the last 24 hours, but sustained an 8.7% in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows. Valuation Inquiries Arise The rapid rise of SUI has evoked excitement among many but it has also raised doubts. In fact, some analysts are questioning whether there is a justification in the prevailing market capitalization of the token to its real fundamentals. The rising value has sparked a debate because people are trying to measure SUI’s market capitalization in order to come up with underlying problems. Such an occurrence is not unusual for coins and even tokens on the rapid expansion corner; however, it also tends to instill some doubts into potential buyers. Insider selling is another worry. Significant transactions from a foundation wallet during the token’s recent rise have raised questions about its price sustainability. Divesting during a price spike may indicate insider insecurity, making investors doubt long-term prospects. SUI market cap currently at $5.6 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Comparison Of Fully Diluted Valuation The complexity of SUI’s current condition is exacerbated by its Fully Diluted Valuation. The FDV of SUI is $1.2 billion, far lower than Solana’s $4.7 billion. Several market experts claim that Solana could be mispriced because the fully diluted valuation of Solana is less than one-third that of Ethereum. This has led some to conclude that SUI is overvalued at this time. Such a comparison also raises the issue of possible mispricing in the market, which makes it necessary for investors to weigh the pros and cons before getting involved. At present, there is a competition among various cryptocurrencies and knowing the valuation of such projects relative to other tokens makes one comprehend better each of the tokens.

The examination of the movement of prices points out that an upward trend will occur since the estimates show that there will be a substantial increase in the market size in a few months. In the coming three months, the price of SUI is expected to shoot up by 244%, which attracts many hopeful investors. It is advisable for the investors to be careful. Considering the high volume of insider sales and concerns on valuations, the future might not be so rosy as it has been projected. Keeping track of market dynamics and technical analysis will be very important for addressing the risk that comes with the rapid rise of SUI.

The crypto market is experiencing heightened volatility as optimism grows, increasing token prices. In recent weeks, Solana and other major cryptocurrencies have been on a rollercoaster ride, and the coming weeks promise continued uncertainty as volatility shows no signs of slowing down. Related Reading: On-Chain Metrics Reveal Bitcoin Demand Is Growing – Can BTC Break ATHs In Q4? Key metrics from DefiLlama reveal that Solana’s total value locked (TVL) has reached a new yearly high, now at around $6 billion, its highest level since September 2022. This TVL increase signals confidence in Solana’s ecosystem and decentralized finance (DeFi) offerings. Investors and traders are closely watching the market, with Solana’s performance likely to serve as a key indicator for broader market sentiment. As Solana tests this crucial resistance level, the next few days will determine whether the token continues its upward momentum or faces another round of volatility. Solana Testing Crucial Resistance Solana is flirting with a 5% surge, poised to challenge local highs and potentially confirm a long-term uptrend. As the broader crypto market experiences a shift, investors and traders are eagerly searching for signals that Solana is ready to break into new highs. Key data from DefiLlama shows that Solana’s total value locked (TVL) has reached a new yearly high of $6 billion. TVL measures the total value of assets deposited into a blockchain project and is a key indicator of user confidence and engagement. A rising TVL suggests that more users are locking their funds into Solana’s decentralized applications, a sign of growing trust in its ecosystem. This increase in TVL further supports the bullish outlook that many investors hold for Solana. The platform’s expanding DeFi offerings and solid infrastructure make it a strong contender in the altcoin space. As Solana continues to push toward new highs, such fundamental data reinforces optimism about its future price action. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Target $3,400 Once It Breaks Above Bullish Pattern – Details A confirmed surge above key resistance levels could begin a sustained upward trend for Solana, positioning it as one of the top performers in the market. Investors are watching closely to see if the current price movement can translate into a longer-term rally. Key Levels To Watch Solana is currently trading at $155 after a volatile session yesterday. The price successfully retested and now holds above the 200-day moving average (MA) at $151, signaling strong support for the asset. This level has been a key indicator for traders, and maintaining it is crucial for sustaining the current bullish momentum. For bulls to keep the momentum going, SOL must stay above this 200-day MA and break through the $160 level. Such a move would likely confirm a bullish trend and propel Solana to test its yearly highs around $210. This would mark a significant upward move, reflecting optimism in the market and increasing confidence among traders and investors. However, the bullish momentum could weaken if the price fails to close above $160 and holds above the 200-day MA. In this case, a retracement is likely, with the price potentially dropping to lower demand levels around $140.

The liquidity staking platform said it now supports the deployment of its stETH value-accruing token on Optimism, a layer-2 solution for Ethereum. Expansion to Optimism: What It Means In a blog post, Lido Finance said the decision will allow its users to benefit from daily staking rewards. At the same time, the platform said, those who choose to deploy their stETH on Optimism will have a seamless bridging experience while concurrently unlocking other multichain opportunities. Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Gearing Up For ‘Massive Breakout’, Will It Skyrocket To $20? The deployment means Lido Finance is expanding in line with its multichain strategy. By offering stETH and wstETH on multiple layer-2 platforms on Ethereum, including on Arbitrum, the liquidity staking solution gives users a more flexible way to stake their ETH. Moreover, because Ethereum layer-2 solutions are designed to be scaled, all transactions, Lido Finance said, will be cheap. Lido Finance is among several liquidity-staking platforms that allow users to stake their ETH and earn a yield. This is possible because Ethereum successfully migrated from a proof-of-work consensus to a staking system in 2022 after the Merge. Once developers powered off the proof-of-work system, the network was migrated to the Beacon chain. In this new chain, validators secured and processed all transactions. With validators in the equation, those who sought to operate full nodes and compete for a part of the 3 ETH block reward and fees had to lock in 32 ETH. This threshold was out of reach for most users. Accordingly, the platform allows users to stake ETH without having the 32 ETH required to run a full node. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Sharp Decline: Over 106,000 Wallets Abandon The Memecoin Lido Finance Manages Over $25 Billion, LDO Down 72% In 9 Months As of October 16, DeFiLlama data shows that Lido Finance had a total value locked (TVL) of over $25 billion. Over the last year alone, the protocol has generated over $845 million in the last year and more than $1.8 billion since launching. Although the protocol helps secure the Ethereum mainnet, ETH holders of several layer-2s, including Arbitrum, Base, Linea, and Scroll, can stake directly from these off-chain solutions. Despite Lido Finance growing its ecosystem, LDO prices are struggling for momentum. Even after gains of October 14, the token is yet to break above September highs and reverse losses of the last nine months. After peaking in March, LDO is down 72%.

With this uptick in activity, it is worth assessing Bitcoin to see what this development could spell for the asset’s price trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Finally Breaks Above Falling Wedge Pattern—Here’s The Next Target The Increase In Active Addresses A CryptoQuant analyst, who goes by the pseudonym Crazzyblockk, recently highlighted this trend on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, emphasizing that the spike in active addresses is a promising sign for Bitcoin. According to the analyst, the “Bitcoin Active Address Momentum” metric, which compares monthly and yearly moving averages of active addresses, has shown a significant rise, indicating a positive shift in network activity. For context, the Bitcoin Active Address Momentum metric is used to track changes in the level of user activity on the network. By comparing monthly and yearly moving averages, the metric helps detect increased or decreased engagement patterns. In this case, Bitcoin’s active addresses have surged above both the monthly and yearly moving averages, marking a potential turning point for the network. What This Surge In Active Addresses Means For Bitcoin Crazzyblockk explained that while it is challenging to correlate the rise in active addresses with price performance directly, this growth represents a broader trend of renewed interest in Bitcoin. Historically, spikes in active addresses have been associated with increased demand, often preceding or occurring during bullish market cycles. This surge in user participation may signal a growing demand for Bitcoin, potentially fueling a more sustained upward movement in price. Meanwhile, although Bitcoin’s price performance throughout the summer months was lackluster, increasing active addresses may catalyze a renewed bullish phase. The analyst further noted that increased network activity is often critical to long-term price growth. Therefore, this spike in active addresses is a positive development that should be monitored. Related Reading: Bitcoin Analyst Reveals Best On-Chain Metric For ‘Day-To-Day Trading’ Network activity is often viewed as a key indicator of market sentiment and investor interest. The market may be gearing up for another expansion phase, with user engagement increasing. This could also impact other cryptocurrencies, as Bitcoin’s price trends often influence the entire crypto market. So far, Bitcoin seems to be gradually reflecting the implication of this increase in network activity. Over the past week, the top crypto has risen by nearly 10% as it trades above the $67,000 price.

The price must settle above the $0.5550 resistance to start a steady increase in the near term. XRP price is consolidating above the $0.5320 zone. The price is now trading above $0.5400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5435 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.550 and $0.5550 resistance levels. XRP Price Holds Support XRP price made another attempt to clear the $0.5550 resistance zone. However, the bears remained active below $0.5550 and there was no upside break. The price corrected some gains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move below the $0.5500 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5377 swing low to the $0.5537 high. However, the bulls are active and protecting more losses below $0.540. The price is now trading above $0.540 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5435 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5377 swing low to the $0.5537 high. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5500 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.5520 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5550. A clear move above the $0.5550 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5650 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5840 resistance or even $0.5880 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.6000. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5550 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.540 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $0.5350 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5350 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5265 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.5180 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.5400 and $0.5350.

As the broader crypto market navigates a period of volatility and uncertainty, traders eagerly search for confirmation of a potential rally. WIF, which has gained significant traction in recent months, is now at a crucial point where the next move could define its short-term future. Related Reading: Solana Will Target New ATHs Once It Breaks $160 Resistance – Analyst Prominent analyst and investor Ali Martinez has shared insightful data suggesting a bullish outlook for DogWifHat. Metrics point toward a rise in price action, which could lead to a breakout, with WIF potentially surging to the $4 mark if momentum continues to build. However, the coming days will be key in determining whether a bull trend can be confirmed as market participants await signs of sustained upward movement. All eyes are on WIF to see if it can capitalize on this moment and rally to new heights. DogWifHat Turning Point DogWifHat (WIF) is at a critical turning point, with its price hovering just above the $2.5 mark, a crucial psychological level for confirming an ongoing uptrend. Investors and traders are closely watching this level, as its ability to hold will determine whether WIF pushes to new highs or retraces to lower demand zones. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that a buy signal has appeared for WIF on a key indicator, the TD Sequential. The TD Sequential, known for accurately predicting trend reversals in the crypto market, has previously been spot-on for DogWifHat. According to Martinez, this new buy signal could be the catalyst that sends WIF into a bullish phase, fueling optimism among investors. The overall sentiment in the market is also leaning toward a potential surge as volatility continues to rise and other major cryptocurrencies show signs of life. Martinez’s analysis supports the growing belief that WIF could be on the verge of a breakout, especially if it holds the $2.5 level. Related Reading: Dogecoin Buy Signal Hints At Upside As Funding Rate Keeps Rising However, if the price fails to maintain this support, investors expect a drop to lower demand levels. In the coming weeks, WIF’s price movement will be pivotal in determining whether the meme coin continues its upward trajectory or faces further corrections. WIF Technical Analysis WIF is currently trading at $2.62 after experiencing a few days of volatile price action within a sustained uptrend. On Monday, the price set a new high at $2.97 but has since retraced slightly and is now testing crucial demand at a previous resistance level of around $2.5. This level is key for bulls, as holding above $2.5 would maintain the upward momentum and set WIF up to target the $3 mark, in line with the broader market’s continued push upward. However, should WIF fail to hold the $2.5 level and close below it, this could indicate a shift in the price structure and signal the start of a correction. Related Reading: Analyst Forecasts XRP Bullish Breakout – A 1,000% Opportunity? Traders are keeping a close eye on these levels, as a drop below $2.5 would suggest weakening bullish momentum and the potential for a pullback to lower support areas. The next few days will determine whether WIF continues its uptrend or faces a short-term retracement.

Bitcoin mining remains challenging with profitability near historic lows, despite MARA's Slipstream product slightly boosting transaction fee revenue. MARA's strategy of borrowing to buy Bitcoin has significantly increased its BTC holdings, but at higher interest rates compared to competitors like MicroStrategy. With 25.7% short interest, MARA shares are highly shorted, reflecting market skepticism, yet potential for short squeezes could drive price spikes. Back in May when I last wrote about Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ) for Seeking Alpha, I called the stock a 'hold' and made note of the company's edge over other mining pools in average block fees. I also highlighted the trend in production and industry profitability, among other things. Since then, we have some new catalysts that I think lend credence to the notion that MARA shares will ultimately serve as little more than trading instruments rather than a quality investment over time. In this update, we'll look at MARA's 'diversification' of the company's mining footprint to another cryptocurrency, re-assess how MARA Pool is progressing against the competition, and consider the company's new BTC acquisition strategy. Pivoting To Kaspa Mining In late-June, MARA announced it had begun mining Kaspa ( KAS-USD ) in addition to its Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining operation to diversify away from just BTC. In the press release, MARA mentioned the Kaspa mining strategy actually started in September 2023. Marathon also noted Kaspa mining margins of up to 95% in certain cases, given the price of KAS and the low network difficulty rate for miners. Marathon guided for full energization of its 60 petahash Kaspa ASIC purchases by the end of Q3. The chart below is quite telling: KAS Hash Rate (kaspalytics) Kaspa currently has a global hash rate approaching 1.2 EH/s. But what I find interesting is the timing of the enormous spike in KAS mining in mid-July. The global hash rate for Kaspa mining was 0.35 EH/s the day Marathon announced its Kaspa mining strategy. Global exahash is now roughly three times that level, and yet, the price of KAS is actually down 25%: KAS Daily Chart (TrendSpider) So any real Kaspa profit edge that MARA had in June before announcing its Kaspa strategy is likely gone at this point. It's three times more difficult to generate a coin that is worth 25% less than it was the day of MARA's press release. If the company's goal was to tout a profitable new business line, it doesn't appear that it has lasted very long. Bitcoin Mining Challenges I think it's important to understand that the very notion that MARA would mention Kaspa mining is not a small admission from the biggest public miner in the industry that mining BTC is a bad business: Bitcoin Hashprice, 1yr (Hashrateindex) Though it's slightly ahead of the lows from August and September, the US dollar-denominated hash price for Bitcoin has been under $50 per PH/s for most of the last 5 months. Bitcoin mining profitability is still very much near the lowest levels in the history of the chain. I've covered this ad nauseam at this point, but the fixed supply of the native asset means miners need higher BTC prices in perpetuity or a larger share of transaction fees as a percentage of total rewards. Miner Rewards Distribution (IntoTheBlock) I think it should go without saying, Bitcoiners would want to see the latter option be the way miners are incentivized going forward. So far, we're simply not seeing the stickiness of transaction fees for longer than a few weeks at a time. Since the April halving, transaction fee percent of total miner rewards has averaged about 4%. This is inline with what the average has been since the beginning of 2022. However, more recently, that average has dipped back below 2%. To company's credit, MARA has taken steps to get more than its 'fair share' of revenue from transactions through its Slipstream product. I covered this in my last MARA article from May, and I would recommend reading that for more details. But the main takeaway is MARA Pool can generate more from transaction fees if users decide to go to MARA directly for transaction validation. In May, MARA Pool was getting an 11% bump over expected block fees, which, I believe, was a direct result of Slipstream. Rank Pool Blocks Avg Block Fees Empty Blocks 1 Foundry USA 7748 (29.33%) -1.71% 0 (0.00%) 2 AntPool 6682 (25.3%) -1.73% 34 (0.51%) 3 ViaBTC 3533 (13.37%) -1.61% 4 (0.11%) 4 F2Pool 2784 (10.54%) -2.18% 6 (0.22%) 5 MARA Pool 1086 (4.11%) +0.65% 0 (0.00%) 6 Binance Pool 792 (3%) -1.73% 6 (0.76%) 7 SpiderPool 777 (2.94%) -6.45% 27 (3.47%) 8 Luxor 603 (2.28%) -1.94% 5 (0.83%) 9 Braiins Pool 469 (1.78%) -1.20% 0 (0.00%) 10 SBI Crypto 466 (1.76%) -2.44% 0 (0.00%) Source: Mempool, last 6 months as of 10/16/24 We've since seen a normalization of that block fee premium going to MARA Pool. As of article submission, the block fee bump for MARA Pool is just 0.65% over the last 6 months. The good news is, MARA Pool is still outperforming the other mining pools even at that rate. Adopting The 'Infinite Money Glitch' Bitcoin mining is a very difficult business long term; that's fairly obvious at this point. I suspect MARA already knows the same is true for Kaspa mining today - which has 87% of its total supply already mined. What can the company do to benefit from long term price appreciation of BTC if there is only so much mining revenue remaining? It can adopt the 'infinite money glitch' approach that has been pioneered by MicroStrategy ( MSTR ): Monthly BTC Treasury (MARA Holdings, Author's Chart) Since the end of June, we've seen MARA's BTC position explode from 18,536 to 26,842 BTC. The company has mined 2,070 BTC since the end of June but grown its treasury by over 8.3k BTC over that period of time. This 45% three-month rip in MARA's HODL stash is mostly attributable to MARA borrowing to buy Bitcoin. The company bought $100 million in BTC in July and $249 million worth of BTC in August. For the August purchase, Marathon Digital issued $300 million in convertible senior notes due in 2031. These notes pay 2.125% interest, which is a much higher rate than what MicroStrategy has been paying creditors to do exactly the same thing. The good news is at $67k, Marathon already has a $31 million paper gain on those August BTC purchases as they came at an average price of $59.5k. Short Interest Headed Higher For me, the long term investment thesis for MARA shares is getting a bit more challenging. The company's mining operation needs higher BTC prices to be profitable. I believe the Kaspa mining experiment is already a non-winner. And the short interest in the company probably tells the tale: Data by YCharts At 25.7%, MARA has the largest percentage of shares outstanding sold short of any of the top 5 BTC mining companies in the public markets. Being a highly shorted stock isn't anything new to MARA, but the current 25.7% level would be near the high of the year. There are two ways to look at this, though. On one hand, shorting a stock shows a high level of conviction in future price declines and with more than a quarter of the shares sold short, the market is telling investors this is not a stock to buy. On the other hand, if the bears are wrong and are forced to cover, we could theoretically see an explosion to the upside as bears get squeezed: Data by YCharts We saw this happen twice in 2023 when short interest declines directly coincided with large price moves higher for MARA shares. Essentially, bears may not be wrong about the fundamental problems with Marathon's long-term business model, but that doesn't necessarily mean the price of MARA shares can't move higher anyway. Investor Takeaways I'm still rating MARA shares a 'hold' today because I suspect Bitcoin is very close to a technical breakout of 6 month resistance. Due to the fact that MARA has such a large BTC position, I suspect BTC price appreciation will drag MARA shares higher as well. But there can be little doubt at this point that the market has been rewarding BTC miners that have pivoted to HPC services. MARA seems to be pivoting more to the MicroStrategy model of borrowing long term to buy Bitcoin. If you like that approach, MSTR is probably a much better expression of that idea because the company has lower borrow costs and doesn't have the depreciation baggage that public miners have.",KAS-USD|BTC-USD|MSTR|MARA,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-10-17 05:30:00

This upward momentum is in line with the predictions of various market experts, expecting significant gains for the leading cryptocurrency by the end of the year. One such expert, crypto analyst Gert van Lagen, recently shared his insights on Bitcoin’s price trajectory via social media platform X (formerly Twitter). He analyzed BTC’s parabolic curve and identified a distinctive step-like formation pattern, which he believes signals a colossal wave 5 rally in the coming months. Potential ‘Shake-Out Of The Century’ In his analysis, van Lagen presented a Bitcoin chart demonstrating that the cryptocurrency has successfully navigated several hurdles since April 2023. He categorized the price movement into three distinct phases, marking the base of the uptrend pattern that has ignited the current bullish trend. Currently, van Lagen notes that Bitcoin’s price action is centered around base 4 of this pattern, indicating a consolidation phase between the $53,700 and $68,000 levels, with the former identified as bull market support for this cycle. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Sharp Decline: Over 106,000 Wallets Abandon The Memecoin Van Lagen asserts that the validation of Wave 4 is imminent as Bitcoin approaches its record peak. He predicts that once Bitcoin breaks through base 4 and achieves a new all-time high, it could trigger a substantial rally in wave 5, potentially targeting prices around $250,000. However, the analyst also warns of a significant downturn that may follow this surge. He suggests that once Bitcoin reaches the anticipated peak, a “recession” could ensue, with price targets plummeting to as low as $10,000, and in a more extreme scenario, down to $1,000. He describes this potential decline as the “shake-out of the century,” should these projections materialize. In the medium term, the increased volatility that has characterized Bitcoin’s price over the past month has prompted the analyst to explain that if Bitcoin fails to break through the $70,000 resistance level – a barrier it has struggled with in four previous attempts – then the $57,500 level will serve as a crucial support level for the cryptocurrency. Historical Patterns Suggest Bitcoin Price Increases Ahead In another sign of confidence in the biggest cryptocurrency’s prospects for further gains, Blockforce Capital’s Brett Munster noted that conditions are ripe for a “perfect storm” favoring Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies after six months of price consolidation. Munster highlighted the role of global liquidity in this potential surge, pointing to increased capital injections from central banks worldwide. Notably, China has implemented stimulus measures to revitalize its economy. Related Reading: Ethereum Open Interest Sees Fastest Rise In 5 Months: Brace For More Volatility? Historical data suggests that when global liquidity surpasses its moving average, it often coincides with substantial price increases for Bitcoin. In addition, optimism in the crypto market is further bolstered by a commitment from US Vice President Kamala Harris to support a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in response to long-standing concerns from the crypto community regarding the regulatory environment. At the time of writing, BTC has been trading at $68,300, up 3.6% in the last 24 hours.

This zone is the next crucial level, as the cryptocurrency hasn’t successfully broken above it in nearly three months. Market analyst CryptoWolf pointed out that Ethereum has been rejected from the local top around this level twice since August’s market crash, making it the next big resistance to break. However, once the zone is cleared, ETH’s price is “heading straight to the 3500s” since the analyst considers that the $3,000 mark “won’t stand a chance.” Similarly, crypto analyst Alex Clay suggested that the King of Altcoins is about to “catch up on BTC” and rise toward $3,500. To the analyst, Ethereum completed its local accumulation within the $2,100-$2,700 range, and “it’s ready to switch the short-term trend for the bullish.” Other market watchers also suggested that the market is near the bottom after the sideway moves, based on the ETH/BTC chart. Tony Research stated that the chart “suggests that altcoins are currently cheap relative to Bitcoin. An increase in this chart will positively affect altcoins and their prices.” As the investor pointed out, altcoins could see significant growth during Q1 2025 since Q4s have historically been Bitcoin’s best time to grow. ETH Attempts Breakout From Bullish Pattern Analyst Crypto Yapper noted that Ethereum is trying to break from its consolidating formation. The cryptocurrency has been within a three-month symmetrical triangle pattern, and it attempted to break above the upper trendline on Tuesday. Yesterday, ETH rose momentarily above the trendline after hitting $2,688 but quickly retraced to $2,550. Ethereum tried another breakout from the symmetrical triangle upper trendline on Wednesday, surging above $2,630 before settling around the $2,600 support zone. Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Gearing Up For ‘Massive Breakout’, Will It Skyrocket To $20? To the analyst, Ethereum will target the $2,900 mark next if it breaks out of this formation. Recovering this level could propel ETH’s price to its March highs, as the $2,900-$3,000 price range was a key support zone during the rally’s first leg. Meanwhile, season trader Peter Brandt recently highlighted an inverted Head and Shoulders (H&S) pattern on ETH’s chart. The trader signaled that an H&S bottom is forming, also suggesting a massive breakout might be imminent. As of this writing, ETH is trading at $2,612, a 1% increase in the daily timeframe.

Here’s what this could mean for the asset. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index Is Currently Showing Red Values As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the BTC Coinbase Premium Index is inside the negative zone right now. The “Coinbase Premium Index” is an indicator that measures the difference between the Bitcoin prices listed on the cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair). When the value of this metric is positive, it means the BTC price listed on Coinbase is currently higher than that on Binance. Such a trend suggests the former is observing a higher buying pressure (or a lower selling pressure) than the latter. Related Reading: Bitcoin Extreme Greed Is Nearly Here: Will This Lead To A Top? On the other hand, the negative indicator implies that Coinbase users are participating in a higher degree of selling than Binance ones, as the coin is trading at a lower rate there. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index has shown an interesting relationship with price until recently. It would appear that whenever the metric would assume positive values, the asset would rally, and whenever it would dip into the negative territory, the price would also plunge. This pattern extends beyond the chart window, as 2024 in its entirety has generally shown the two moving with notable correlation. The trend naturally suggests that Coinbase users have been potential market drivers, as the changes in their behavior have been inducing price action. Coinbase is the preferred platform of investors based in the US, especially large institutional entities, while Binance is the hub of global investors. As such, the index’s value tells us about how the behavior of American whales differs from the rest of the world. While the US-based institutional investors have been key for much of 2024, the pattern appears to have diverged recently. The chart shows that as the latest rally in the Bitcoin price has occurred, the indicator’s value has been red. This isn’t the only pattern that has been broken, as the index also tends to turn green whenever the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) witness inflows. The spot ETFs have seen significant net inflows recently, but the metric’s value has not flipped. “This raises the question of whether investors on Binance, whether retailers, institutions, or whales, are surpassing the buying pressure on Coinbase Pro,” notes the quant.

It remains to be seen if the index and the price will continue to show a divergence shortly, implying a possible shift in market structure away from being Coinbase-dominated, or if it’s just a temporary deviation. BTC Price Bitcoin has continued its recent bullish push during the past day, as its price has now reached $68,000.

Amidst a crypto landscape where Bitcoin and emerging high-performance blockchains like Solana, Sui, and Aptos dominate headlines, Hougan positions Ethereum as a “contrarian bet” that may offer significant returns for investors willing to look beyond current market sentiments. Why Ethereum Is The Best “Contrarian Bet” Hougan acknowledged Ethereum’s unique position within the crypto market. He describes Ethereum as “the asset that people love to hate; it’s kind of the middle child of crypto.” While Bitcoin maintains its status as the original cryptocurrency and a store of value, newer blockchains capture attention with promises of superior performance and innovative features. Ethereum, meanwhile, is often criticized for issues like high fees and the migration of activity to Layer-2’s, leading some to view it as outdated technology struggling to keep pace with its competitors. Related Reading: How The Israel-Iran War Could Shake Crypto Prices, Explains Arthur Hayes However, Hougan challenges this narrative by emphasizing Ethereum’s foundational role in some of the most critical and rapidly growing areas of the crypto industry. “When you step back and look at it, what are the killer apps of crypto outside of Bitcoin? They are things like stablecoins, DeFi [decentralized finance], and tokenization,” he notes. Despite the emergence of alternative platforms, Ethereum remains the leading blockchain supporting these applications. It is the primary choice for developers and institutions. “If you’re a large traditional financial player looking to build on a public blockchain what blockchain are you going to choose most likely? You’re going to choose Ethereum,” Hougan claims. The Bitwise CIO attributes Ethereum’s underperformance to a transitional phase in its development. “I think Ethereum has sort of passed over this year because it’s going through this complex teenage adjustment in its architecture,” he explained. This “teenage adjustment” refers to Ethereum’s ongoing upgrades. Hougan remains bullish on Ethereum’s long-term prospects, considering it a strong contrarian play for 2025. “Ethereum is the best contrarian bet in crypto right now,” he stated via X. Hougan believes that the market’s current focus on Bitcoin and newer blockchains has caused many to overlook Ethereum’s enduring strengths and potential for growth. He asserts that as the blockchain completes its architectural upgrades, it will be better positioned to capitalize on its dominant role in key sectors like stablecoins and DeFi. When asked whether he believes Ethereum will break it’s all-time highs, Hougan expressed cautious optimism. “I certainly think we could see that in 2025 if we see significant growth in the application space,” he responded. However, he emphasized that Ethereum’s ability to reach new price levels is more conditional compared to Bitcoin. “I think it’s maybe more conditional than Bitcoin,” he admitted. Related Reading: Crypto Prices Go Up: A ‘Cautious Bullish’ Outlook Amid Fed Worries And Market Volatility Key among these conditions is the enactment of favorable stablecoin legislation. “We need to see positive stablecoin legislation that helps that move aggressively into the mainstream,” Hougan stresses. Regulatory clarity and support for stablecoins could lead to increased adoption and integration into the mainstream financial system, directly benefiting Ethereum as the primary platform for these digital assets. Additionally, he points to the necessity for continued growth in decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Ethereum network. “We need to see more growth in apps that are built on the Ethereum ecosystem,” he added. Hougan advises investors to focus on the overall growth and development of the Ethereum ecosystem rather than short-term concerns like fee structures or the migration to Layer 2 solutions. “I don’t think that’s the game to play with Ethereum right now,” he remarks regarding worries about fees and network congestion. Instead, he suggests that the intrinsic value of Ethereum will become apparent as its ecosystem expands and matures. “Think about the growth of the ecosystem, and the value will sort itself out,” he asserts. Hougan stated that while he remains bullish on both Bitcoin and Ethereum, he sees a unique opportunity with Ethereum due to its current undervaluation and the market’s overlooking of its potential. “I know I just made a very bullish case for Bitcoin; now I’m making a very bullish case for Ethereum. I am bullish for both, and I think the setup for both is pretty good,” he concludes. At press time, ETH traded at $2,624.

The strategic move aims to provide investors with a diversified portfolio that includes major digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP and Avalanche (AVAX). Diversified Exposure To Bitcoin, Ethereum, And More The proposed ETF comes at a time when investor interest in regulated cryptocurrency products is on the rise. Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund currently holds approximately $524 million in assets under management, with a significant focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Specifically, about 75% of the fund is allocated to Bitcoin, while Ethereum comprises roughly 19%, with the remaining investments distributed among Solana, XRP, and Avalanche. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Sharp Decline: Over 106,000 Wallets Abandon The Memecoin According to reports on the matter, this diversified approach is designed to offer a balanced entry point for investors seeking broader exposure to the cryptocurrency market. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) had previously filed a 19b-4 application on behalf of Grayscale, seeking the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval to amend its rulebook to permit the listing of this new ETF. This filing follows a pivotal year for the market, which recently saw the approval of spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum in January and July respectively, allowing these funds to hold actual tokens rather than relying on futures contracts. This shift comes after years of rejections of such index funds, spurred by a court ruling in favor of Grayscale that prompted the Securities and Exchange Commission led by Gary Gensler to reconsider its stance. Grayscale Aims For Fifth ETF Launch This Year The successful conversion of Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund into an ETF would mark the fifth launch by the firm this year, highlighting its strategy to expand its product offerings in response to increasing demand for diverse digital asset exposure. Balchunas noted that the ETF’s holdings, predominantly consisting of Bitcoin and Ethereum, could provide enough flexibility to accommodate smaller, less liquid assets, potentially paving the way for approval. Over the course of the year, Grayscale’s Bitcoin and Ethereum funds have seen significant outflows, with around $20 billion and $3 billion withdrawn respectively. In response, the firm has introduced lower-fee versions of these funds, attracting over $700 million in inflows thus far. These approvals have contributed to a surge in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices, indicating a renewed investor confidence in the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Can Port To $86,600 If It Breaks This Level Other asset managers are also positioning themselves to launch ETFs that include smaller tokens such as Solana, XRP and Litecoin, with recent filings from Canary Capital and Bitwise Invest highlighting a broader trend to integrate a wider range of cryptocurrencies into regulated investment vehicles, despite increased scrutiny from regulators in the US. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market, BTC, is trading at $67,750, up a substantial 11% on a weekly basis.

Analyst Breaks Down Major Catalysts",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/is-100000-bitcoin-feasible/,"As Bitcoin (BTC) edges closer to the $70,000 mark, the crypto community is abuzz with predictions of a potential surge to $100,000, accompanied by a significant altcoin season. Amidst this fervor, crypto analyst Axel Bitblaze has provided an analysis on X, examining whether the necessary liquidity and catalysts are in place to propel Bitcoin to such heights. Bitblaze emphasizes the fundamental role of liquidity in the crypto market. Drawing parallels to previous bull runs, he notes, “Our space is fully driven by just one thing, i.e., Liquidity.” He references the 2016 and 2020 bull markets, both of which were significantly fueled by increasing liquidity. This time, the question is whether similar or greater liquidity events are on the horizon to drive Bitcoin’s price higher. #1 Bitcoin Surge Set To Be Fueled By Stablecoins A cornerstone of Bitblaze’s analysis is the current state of the stablecoins market. He describes stablecoins as “the gateway to the crypto industry,” underscoring their indispensability to the crypto ecosystem. The total market capitalization of stablecoins has surged to $173 billion, reaching its highest level since the collapse of TerraUSD (UST). Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Massive Surge In Active Addresses: Here’s What It Signals For Price Tether (USDT) remains the dominant player, comprising 69% of the total stablecoin market cap with $120 billion. Bitblaze highlights the historical correlation between BTC prices and USDT’s market capitalization, stating, “Between March 2020 to November 2021, USDT MCap rose by 17x while BTC price pumped by 16.5x.” However, since March 2024, despite USDT’s market cap continuing to rise, Bitcoin’s price has remained relatively stagnant. “This indicates there’s a lot of liquidity waiting on the sidelines to enter BTC and crypto. I guess they’ll start deploying soon, right?” the analyst states. #2 FASB Rule Change Another significant factor is the impending change in accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Currently, publicly listed companies face challenges in holding Bitcoin due to unfavorable accounting treatments. Bitblaze explains, “Let’s say a company bought 100 BTC at $67,000 each. If BTC drops to $60,000 and then pumps to $68,000, the company still needs to report it at $60,000… they will have to show it as a loss even though it’s in profit.” This results in misleading earnings reports and adversely affects share prices, discouraging companies from investing in Bitcoin despite its potential as an asset. The upcoming FASB rule change, set to be implemented in December 2024, is poised to address this issue. Under the new guidelines, companies will be able to report the fair value of their Bitcoin holdings based on market prices at the end of the reporting period. Bitblaze suggests that this regulatory shift could incentivize more corporations to adopt Bitcoin as part of their balance sheets.

With S&P 500 companies collectively holding approximately $2.5 trillion in cash and cash equivalents—assets vulnerable to inflation—Bitcoin presents itself as an attractive, inflation-resistant alternative. #3 Expanding M2 Money Supply Bitblaze also delves into the macroeconomic landscape, particularly the M2 money supply, which includes cash, checking deposits, and other easily convertible near money. Currently, the M2 money supply stands at $94 trillion, nearly 39 times the total crypto market capitalization. Bitblaze references an analysis indicating that “for every 10% increase in M2 money supply, BTC pumps 90%.” Despite the M2 money supply being approximately 3% higher than its previous peak, Bitcoin has yet to surpass its 2021 highs, suggesting that ample liquidity remains untapped. “Currently, M2 money supply is almost 3% higher than its last peak, while BTC is still below its 2021 high. With Global rate cuts happening along with QE, fiat will become a worse investment. As Ray Dalio said, #Cash is Trash,# and now this gigantic money supply will find a way into different asset classes, including crypto; the analyst claims. #4 Shift From Money Market Funds To Bitcoin Since November 2021, money market funds have grown to $6.5 trillion as investors sought the safety of Treasury bills amid rising interest rates. However, with the Federal Reserve initiating rate cuts and signaling more to come, the yields on T-bills are expected to diminish, likely causing a significant outflow from money market funds. Bitblaze predicts, “This’ll cause a massive outflow from money market funds as the T-bills yield will diminish,” suggesting that investors will seek higher returns in riskier assets such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He refers to these digital assets as “the fastest horses” in a QE environment, forecasting that this shift could channel substantial capital into the crypto markets. To quantify the potential inflow, Bitblaze aggregates the available liquidity sources: the M2 money supply of $94 trillion, money market funds totaling $6.5 trillion, cash holdings of S&P 500 companies amounting to $2.5 trillion, and the stablecoins market cap of $173 billion. This brings the total to approximately $103.17 trillion, which is 43 times the current total crypto market capitalization. He further addresses skeptics, concluded: “For a $200 Billion inflow, only 0.19% of this account needed to enter crypto. For those who think this isn’t possible and 200B is too much, BTC ETFs had over $20B in net inflows despite sideways price action, no rate cuts, and no QE.” At press time, BTC traded at $66,944.
