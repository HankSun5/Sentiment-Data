34787287,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648286,1729116012,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/34787287.jpeg,"Bitcoin Clears $65,000: Can The Bulls Push BTC To Historic Heights?",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/can-the-bulls-push-bitcoin-to-historic-heights/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has made a bold move, breaking past the crucial $65,000 level and sparking renewed hope of reaching its all-time high. As bullish momentum builds, the market is watching closely to see if this breakthrough could be the start of a larger rally. With previous resistance now behind it, can Bitcoin continue its upward journey and reclaim its record peak? Or will market forces pull it back before reaching new heights? The aim of this article is to explore BTC’s impressive move past the $65,000 level and evaluate its prospects of hitting a new peak. This piece will offer a comprehensive outlook on whether BTC can sustain its rally or face resistance as it approaches record territory through a detailed look at current market dynamics, rising power, and potential challenges. What Breaking The $65,000 Barrier Means For Bitcoin Currently, on the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin is sustaining its position after successfully surpassing the $65,000 mark while trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). By maintaining its position above the $65,000 mark and the 100-day SMA, BTC demonstrates resilience and potential for further upward momentum toward its all-time high of $73,811. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a significant surge, climbing to 77% after dropping to 50%, indicating strong bullish pressure for Bitcoin. While this increase signals growing positive market sentiment, it also raises concerns about the sustainability of the rally, as a possible price correction could occur if profit-taking ensues.

Furthermore, the daily chart indicates that Bitcoin is trading above the 100-day SMA, which is a strong signal of upbeat momentum. This upward movement is marked by a rebound at the $65,000 level, demonstrating significant buying interest from investors. The fact that BTC is consistently above the 100-day SMA suggests a solid trend and that the bulls are eager to push prices higher, potentially leading to more upside movement if pressure continues to build. Lastly, the RSI on the daily chart is currently positioned at 66%, significantly above the pivotal 50% threshold, which indicates a bullish trend for Bitcoin. At 66%, the RSI indicates that BTC’s positive pressure will likely persist, supporting the possibility of continued price gains in the near term as it has not yet reached the overbought territory. Technical Outlook: What Charts Indicate About BTC’s Next Move A technical outlook for Bitcoin indicates a cautiously optimistic trajectory as the cryptocurrency maintains its position above key support levels. Thus, the next resistance level to monitor is its current all-time high of $73,811. A successful breach above this level could pave the way for Bitcoin to reach new heights, potentially setting the stage for a new record. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Restarts Its Climb: Is The Rally Back On? However, if bears take control at the $73,811 resistance level, the price may start to decline toward the $65,00 support range. Additionally, a drop below this level could trigger a deeper decline, possibly leading to a test of the $60,000 support level and beyond.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Currently Inside The Greed Region The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. This index makes use of the data of the following five factors in order to determine the sentiment: trading volume, volatility, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends. Once found, it represents the market mentality as a score between 0 and 100. When the metric has a value greater than 53, it means the traders as a whole share a sentiment of greed right now. On the other hand, it being under the 47 mark implies the dominance of fear in the market. The territory in-between these two corresponds to a net neutral mentality. Related Reading: Ethereum Open Interest Sees Fastest Rise In 5 Months: Brace For More Volatility? Besides these three main sentiment zones, there are also two special regions called the extreme fear and the extreme greed. The former of these occurs at 25 and under, while the latter at 75 and above. Now, here is what the latest value of the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has been like: As is visible above, the indicator has a value of 73, which suggests that the investors are currently showing a significant amount of greed. This is a notable change from how the mood in the market was last week, as the index had declined into the fear zone then. The below chart shows how the value of the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has changed over the past year: From the graph, it’s visible that this latest uplift in the sentiment, which has come as a result of the asset’s rally to $68,000, has taken the index to the highest value since the end of July. Back then, the high sentiment values had led to a top for the cryptocurrency. This type of pattern is something that has actually been witnessed throughout history. It turns out that Bitcoin has a tendency to move in the direction opposite to what the crowd is expecting and the probability of such a contrary move increases the more the traders lean towards one side. In the extreme regions, this likelihood is the strongest, so tops and bottoms have often formed when the investors have shared these sentiments. The current value of the index is just outside the extreme greed zone, so a top could become likely for the asset should the investor mentality continue to improve.

Amidst this bearish development, a crypto analyst remains optimistic about Dogecoin’s price outlook, believing that it can reach new All-Time Highs (ATH) of $10 soon. Dogecoin Holder Base Sees Rapid Decline Santiment, a Market Intelligence platform has unveiled a rather bearish trend involving Dogecoin investors and holders. The platform revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post on October 15 that the number of active Dogecoin holders is falling at a significantly rapid pace. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stochastic Breakout Puts BTC Price Above $500,000, Here’s When Based on its reports, there has been a net loss of approximately 106,600 non-empty wallets since Tuesday, October 8. A non-empty wallet here refers to a crypto wallet that contains at least some DOGE tokens. Sharing a chart illustrating the decline in the Dogecoin holder base, Santiment revealed that the total number of Dogecoin holders is estimated currently at 6.62 million. This figure marks the lowest the DOGE holder base has ever been since April 25, 2024. The net drop of 160,600 indicates that more people are either selling off or withdrawing the DOGE tokens from their wallets than those buying the meme coin. In light of this, Santiment has noted a shift in investors’ sentiment and interest in Dogecoin. The market intelligence platform has disclosed that many traders who had invested in Dogecoin are expressing frustration about the meme coin’s poor market performance. As a result, traders, especially those looking for short-term gains, are moving away from Dogecoin in search of a cryptocurrency that might offer rapid price increases. As of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.12, experiencing slight upticks over the weeks, according to CoinMarketCap. It appears the meme coin’s 10% surge and 17% increase in the past week and month respectively, has not been enough for many investors. As the top meme coin in the market, many expect a dramatic DOGE surge to occur in order to reap immense benefits. However, the cryptocurrency’s recent fluctuating performance and inability to reach the coveted $1 mark has left many investors concerned. Analyst Doubles Down On $10 Price Target For DOGE Amidst the decline in the Dogecoin holder base, a crypto analyst remains highly bullish on the meme coin price outlook. Dima James Potts, an analyst on X has doubled down on his earlier prediction that Dogecoin is headed to $10. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Identifies Bull Flag That Could Send Solana Price To $1,400 In a previous X post on August 8, Potts predicted that Dogecoin is gearing up for a major price increase in 2025. At the time, the analyst based his forecast on DOGE’s historical patterns and past performance, highlighting that in the two previous market cycles, Dogecoin had surged 9,000% and 18,000% in 2017, and 2021 respectively. Now the analyst is reinforcing his earlier prediction, emphasizing that history cannot be changed, while asserting that a $10 price surge for Dogecoin was seemingly inevitable.

BTC is currently up ~52% year-to-date. Ether's price climbed higher, ending above $2,600. ETH is now up ~11% year-to-date. XRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. XRP is currently down ~14% year-to-date. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. While both are considered to be high risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Bitcoin's price climbed above the $60,000 level this past week. BTC is currently up ~52% year-to-date. Ether Ether ( ETH-USD ) is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second-largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article, with its launch in July 2015. Ether's price climbed higher, ending above $2,600. ETH is now up ~11% year-to-date. XRP XRP ( XRP-USD ), which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We've included it in this article for reference. XRP is currently down ~14% year-to-date. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Bitcoin tops the chart. In other words, the price of a bitcoin has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies. On January 10th, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

It finished the week at its all-time high price of $2.30 and ranked higher than top altcoins such as Polkadot (DOT), therefore ranking itself among the top 15 cryptocurrencies. Among those who support SUI, this achievement has inspired hope since they believe it will become a major competitor in the market.

Congrats to those that listened to me. pic.twitter.com/FtU5vk8f8M — MartyParty (@martypartymusic) October 13, 2024 At the time of writing, SUI was trading at $2.04, down 4.3% in the last 24 hours, but sustained an 8.7% in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows. Valuation Inquiries Arise The rapid rise of SUI has evoked excitement among many but it has also raised doubts. In fact, some analysts are questioning whether there is a justification in the prevailing market capitalization of the token to its real fundamentals. The rising value has sparked a debate because people are trying to measure SUI’s market capitalization in order to come up with underlying problems. Such an occurrence is not unusual for coins and even tokens on the rapid expansion corner; however, it also tends to instill some doubts into potential buyers. Insider selling is another worry. Significant transactions from a foundation wallet during the token’s recent rise have raised questions about its price sustainability. Divesting during a price spike may indicate insider insecurity, making investors doubt long-term prospects. SUI market cap currently at $5.6 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Comparison Of Fully Diluted Valuation The complexity of SUI’s current condition is exacerbated by its Fully Diluted Valuation. The FDV of SUI is $1.2 billion, far lower than Solana’s $4.7 billion. Several market experts claim that Solana could be mispriced because the fully diluted valuation of Solana is less than one-third that of Ethereum. This has led some to conclude that SUI is overvalued at this time. Such a comparison also raises the issue of possible mispricing in the market, which makes it necessary for investors to weigh the pros and cons before getting involved. At present, there is a competition among various cryptocurrencies and knowing the valuation of such projects relative to other tokens makes one comprehend better each of the tokens.

The examination of the movement of prices points out that an upward trend will occur since the estimates show that there will be a substantial increase in the market size in a few months. In the coming three months, the price of SUI is expected to shoot up by 244%, which attracts many hopeful investors. It is advisable for the investors to be careful. Considering the high volume of insider sales and concerns on valuations, the future might not be so rosy as it has been projected. Keeping track of market dynamics and technical analysis will be very important for addressing the risk that comes with the rapid rise of SUI.

The crypto market is experiencing heightened volatility as optimism grows, increasing token prices. In recent weeks, Solana and other major cryptocurrencies have been on a rollercoaster ride, and the coming weeks promise continued uncertainty as volatility shows no signs of slowing down. Related Reading: On-Chain Metrics Reveal Bitcoin Demand Is Growing – Can BTC Break ATHs In Q4? Key metrics from DefiLlama reveal that Solana’s total value locked (TVL) has reached a new yearly high, now at around $6 billion, its highest level since September 2022. This TVL increase signals confidence in Solana’s ecosystem and decentralized finance (DeFi) offerings. Investors and traders are closely watching the market, with Solana’s performance likely to serve as a key indicator for broader market sentiment. As Solana tests this crucial resistance level, the next few days will determine whether the token continues its upward momentum or faces another round of volatility. Solana Testing Crucial Resistance Solana is flirting with a 5% surge, poised to challenge local highs and potentially confirm a long-term uptrend. As the broader crypto market experiences a shift, investors and traders are eagerly searching for signals that Solana is ready to break into new highs. Key data from DefiLlama shows that Solana’s total value locked (TVL) has reached a new yearly high of $6 billion. TVL measures the total value of assets deposited into a blockchain project and is a key indicator of user confidence and engagement. A rising TVL suggests that more users are locking their funds into Solana’s decentralized applications, a sign of growing trust in its ecosystem. This increase in TVL further supports the bullish outlook that many investors hold for Solana. The platform’s expanding DeFi offerings and solid infrastructure make it a strong contender in the altcoin space. As Solana continues to push toward new highs, such fundamental data reinforces optimism about its future price action. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Target $3,400 Once It Breaks Above Bullish Pattern – Details A confirmed surge above key resistance levels could begin a sustained upward trend for Solana, positioning it as one of the top performers in the market. Investors are watching closely to see if the current price movement can translate into a longer-term rally. Key Levels To Watch Solana is currently trading at $155 after a volatile session yesterday. The price successfully retested and now holds above the 200-day moving average (MA) at $151, signaling strong support for the asset. This level has been a key indicator for traders, and maintaining it is crucial for sustaining the current bullish momentum. For bulls to keep the momentum going, SOL must stay above this 200-day MA and break through the $160 level. Such a move would likely confirm a bullish trend and propel Solana to test its yearly highs around $210. This would mark a significant upward move, reflecting optimism in the market and increasing confidence among traders and investors. However, the bullish momentum could weaken if the price fails to close above $160 and holds above the 200-day MA. In this case, a retracement is likely, with the price potentially dropping to lower demand levels around $140.

The liquidity staking platform said it now supports the deployment of its stETH value-accruing token on Optimism, a layer-2 solution for Ethereum. Expansion to Optimism: What It Means In a blog post, Lido Finance said the decision will allow its users to benefit from daily staking rewards. At the same time, the platform said, those who choose to deploy their stETH on Optimism will have a seamless bridging experience while concurrently unlocking other multichain opportunities. Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Gearing Up For ‘Massive Breakout’, Will It Skyrocket To $20? The deployment means Lido Finance is expanding in line with its multichain strategy. By offering stETH and wstETH on multiple layer-2 platforms on Ethereum, including on Arbitrum, the liquidity staking solution gives users a more flexible way to stake their ETH. Moreover, because Ethereum layer-2 solutions are designed to be scaled, all transactions, Lido Finance said, will be cheap. Lido Finance is among several liquidity-staking platforms that allow users to stake their ETH and earn a yield. This is possible because Ethereum successfully migrated from a proof-of-work consensus to a staking system in 2022 after the Merge. Once developers powered off the proof-of-work system, the network was migrated to the Beacon chain. In this new chain, validators secured and processed all transactions. With validators in the equation, those who sought to operate full nodes and compete for a part of the 3 ETH block reward and fees had to lock in 32 ETH. This threshold was out of reach for most users. Accordingly, the platform allows users to stake ETH without having the 32 ETH required to run a full node. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Sharp Decline: Over 106,000 Wallets Abandon The Memecoin Lido Finance Manages Over $25 Billion, LDO Down 72% In 9 Months As of October 16, DeFiLlama data shows that Lido Finance had a total value locked (TVL) of over $25 billion. Over the last year alone, the protocol has generated over $845 million in the last year and more than $1.8 billion since launching. Although the protocol helps secure the Ethereum mainnet, ETH holders of several layer-2s, including Arbitrum, Base, Linea, and Scroll, can stake directly from these off-chain solutions. Despite Lido Finance growing its ecosystem, LDO prices are struggling for momentum. Even after gains of October 14, the token is yet to break above September highs and reverse losses of the last nine months. After peaking in March, LDO is down 72%.

With this uptick in activity, it is worth assessing Bitcoin to see what this development could spell for the asset’s price trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Finally Breaks Above Falling Wedge Pattern—Here’s The Next Target The Increase In Active Addresses A CryptoQuant analyst, who goes by the pseudonym Crazzyblockk, recently highlighted this trend on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, emphasizing that the spike in active addresses is a promising sign for Bitcoin. According to the analyst, the “Bitcoin Active Address Momentum” metric, which compares monthly and yearly moving averages of active addresses, has shown a significant rise, indicating a positive shift in network activity. For context, the Bitcoin Active Address Momentum metric is used to track changes in the level of user activity on the network. By comparing monthly and yearly moving averages, the metric helps detect increased or decreased engagement patterns. In this case, Bitcoin’s active addresses have surged above both the monthly and yearly moving averages, marking a potential turning point for the network. What This Surge In Active Addresses Means For Bitcoin Crazzyblockk explained that while it is challenging to correlate the rise in active addresses with price performance directly, this growth represents a broader trend of renewed interest in Bitcoin. Historically, spikes in active addresses have been associated with increased demand, often preceding or occurring during bullish market cycles. This surge in user participation may signal a growing demand for Bitcoin, potentially fueling a more sustained upward movement in price. Meanwhile, although Bitcoin’s price performance throughout the summer months was lackluster, increasing active addresses may catalyze a renewed bullish phase. The analyst further noted that increased network activity is often critical to long-term price growth. Therefore, this spike in active addresses is a positive development that should be monitored. Related Reading: Bitcoin Analyst Reveals Best On-Chain Metric For ‘Day-To-Day Trading’ Network activity is often viewed as a key indicator of market sentiment and investor interest. The market may be gearing up for another expansion phase, with user engagement increasing. This could also impact other cryptocurrencies, as Bitcoin’s price trends often influence the entire crypto market. So far, Bitcoin seems to be gradually reflecting the implication of this increase in network activity. Over the past week, the top crypto has risen by nearly 10% as it trades above the $67,000 price.

The price must settle above the $0.5550 resistance to start a steady increase in the near term. XRP price is consolidating above the $0.5320 zone. The price is now trading above $0.5400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5435 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.550 and $0.5550 resistance levels. XRP Price Holds Support XRP price made another attempt to clear the $0.5550 resistance zone. However, the bears remained active below $0.5550 and there was no upside break. The price corrected some gains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move below the $0.5500 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5377 swing low to the $0.5537 high. However, the bulls are active and protecting more losses below $0.540. The price is now trading above $0.540 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5435 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5377 swing low to the $0.5537 high. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5500 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.5520 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5550. A clear move above the $0.5550 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5650 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5840 resistance or even $0.5880 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.6000. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5550 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.540 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $0.5350 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5350 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5265 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.5180 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.5400 and $0.5350. Major Resistance Levels – $0.5500 and $0.5550.",XRP|Ripple|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|xrpusdt,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-10-17 04:08:57
