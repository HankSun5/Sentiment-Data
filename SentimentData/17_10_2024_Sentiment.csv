34787287,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648286,1729116012,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/34787287.jpeg,"Bitcoin Clears $65,000: Can The Bulls Push BTC To Historic Heights?",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/can-the-bulls-push-bitcoin-to-historic-heights/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has made a bold move, breaking past the crucial $65,000 level and sparking renewed hope of reaching its all-time high. As bullish momentum builds, the market is watching closely to see if this breakthrough could be the start of a larger rally. With previous resistance now behind it, can Bitcoin continue its upward journey and reclaim its record peak? Or will market forces pull it back before reaching new heights? The aim of this article is to explore BTC’s impressive move past the $65,000 level and evaluate its prospects of hitting a new peak. This piece will offer a comprehensive outlook on whether BTC can sustain its rally or face resistance as it approaches record territory through a detailed look at current market dynamics, rising power, and potential challenges. What Breaking The $65,000 Barrier Means For Bitcoin Currently, on the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin is sustaining its position after successfully surpassing the $65,000 mark while trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). By maintaining its position above the $65,000 mark and the 100-day SMA, BTC demonstrates resilience and potential for further upward momentum toward its all-time high of $73,811. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a significant surge, climbing to 77% after dropping to 50%, indicating strong bullish pressure for Bitcoin. While this increase signals growing positive market sentiment, it also raises concerns about the sustainability of the rally, as a possible price correction could occur if profit-taking ensues.

Furthermore, the daily chart indicates that Bitcoin is trading above the 100-day SMA, which is a strong signal of upbeat momentum. This upward movement is marked by a rebound at the $65,000 level, demonstrating significant buying interest from investors. The fact that BTC is consistently above the 100-day SMA suggests a solid trend and that the bulls are eager to push prices higher, potentially leading to more upside movement if pressure continues to build. Lastly, the RSI on the daily chart is currently positioned at 66%, significantly above the pivotal 50% threshold, which indicates a bullish trend for Bitcoin. At 66%, the RSI indicates that BTC’s positive pressure will likely persist, supporting the possibility of continued price gains in the near term as it has not yet reached the overbought territory. Technical Outlook: What Charts Indicate About BTC’s Next Move A technical outlook for Bitcoin indicates a cautiously optimistic trajectory as the cryptocurrency maintains its position above key support levels. Thus, the next resistance level to monitor is its current all-time high of $73,811. A successful breach above this level could pave the way for Bitcoin to reach new heights, potentially setting the stage for a new record. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Restarts Its Climb: Is The Rally Back On? However, if bears take control at the $73,811 resistance level, the price may start to decline toward the $65,00 support range. Additionally, a drop below this level could trigger a deeper decline, possibly leading to a test of the $60,000 support level and beyond.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Currently Inside The Greed Region The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. This index makes use of the data of the following five factors in order to determine the sentiment: trading volume, volatility, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends. Once found, it represents the market mentality as a score between 0 and 100. When the metric has a value greater than 53, it means the traders as a whole share a sentiment of greed right now. On the other hand, it being under the 47 mark implies the dominance of fear in the market. The territory in-between these two corresponds to a net neutral mentality. Related Reading: Ethereum Open Interest Sees Fastest Rise In 5 Months: Brace For More Volatility? Besides these three main sentiment zones, there are also two special regions called the extreme fear and the extreme greed. The former of these occurs at 25 and under, while the latter at 75 and above. Now, here is what the latest value of the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has been like: As is visible above, the indicator has a value of 73, which suggests that the investors are currently showing a significant amount of greed. This is a notable change from how the mood in the market was last week, as the index had declined into the fear zone then. The below chart shows how the value of the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has changed over the past year: From the graph, it’s visible that this latest uplift in the sentiment, which has come as a result of the asset’s rally to $68,000, has taken the index to the highest value since the end of July. Back then, the high sentiment values had led to a top for the cryptocurrency. This type of pattern is something that has actually been witnessed throughout history. It turns out that Bitcoin has a tendency to move in the direction opposite to what the crowd is expecting and the probability of such a contrary move increases the more the traders lean towards one side. In the extreme regions, this likelihood is the strongest, so tops and bottoms have often formed when the investors have shared these sentiments. The current value of the index is just outside the extreme greed zone, so a top could become likely for the asset should the investor mentality continue to improve.

Amidst this bearish development, a crypto analyst remains optimistic about Dogecoin’s price outlook, believing that it can reach new All-Time Highs (ATH) of $10 soon. Dogecoin Holder Base Sees Rapid Decline Santiment, a Market Intelligence platform has unveiled a rather bearish trend involving Dogecoin investors and holders. The platform revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post on October 15 that the number of active Dogecoin holders is falling at a significantly rapid pace. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stochastic Breakout Puts BTC Price Above $500,000, Here’s When Based on its reports, there has been a net loss of approximately 106,600 non-empty wallets since Tuesday, October 8. A non-empty wallet here refers to a crypto wallet that contains at least some DOGE tokens. Sharing a chart illustrating the decline in the Dogecoin holder base, Santiment revealed that the total number of Dogecoin holders is estimated currently at 6.62 million. This figure marks the lowest the DOGE holder base has ever been since April 25, 2024. The net drop of 160,600 indicates that more people are either selling off or withdrawing the DOGE tokens from their wallets than those buying the meme coin. In light of this, Santiment has noted a shift in investors’ sentiment and interest in Dogecoin. The market intelligence platform has disclosed that many traders who had invested in Dogecoin are expressing frustration about the meme coin’s poor market performance. As a result, traders, especially those looking for short-term gains, are moving away from Dogecoin in search of a cryptocurrency that might offer rapid price increases. As of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.12, experiencing slight upticks over the weeks, according to CoinMarketCap. It appears the meme coin’s 10% surge and 17% increase in the past week and month respectively, has not been enough for many investors. As the top meme coin in the market, many expect a dramatic DOGE surge to occur in order to reap immense benefits. However, the cryptocurrency’s recent fluctuating performance and inability to reach the coveted $1 mark has left many investors concerned. Analyst Doubles Down On $10 Price Target For DOGE Amidst the decline in the Dogecoin holder base, a crypto analyst remains highly bullish on the meme coin price outlook. Dima James Potts, an analyst on X has doubled down on his earlier prediction that Dogecoin is headed to $10. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Identifies Bull Flag That Could Send Solana Price To $1,400 In a previous X post on August 8, Potts predicted that Dogecoin is gearing up for a major price increase in 2025. At the time, the analyst based his forecast on DOGE’s historical patterns and past performance, highlighting that in the two previous market cycles, Dogecoin had surged 9,000% and 18,000% in 2017, and 2021 respectively. Now the analyst is reinforcing his earlier prediction, emphasizing that history cannot be changed, while asserting that a $10 price surge for Dogecoin was seemingly inevitable.

BTC is currently up ~52% year-to-date. Ether's price climbed higher, ending above $2,600. ETH is now up ~11% year-to-date. XRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. XRP is currently down ~14% year-to-date. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. While both are considered to be high risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Bitcoin's price climbed above the $60,000 level this past week. BTC is currently up ~52% year-to-date. Ether Ether ( ETH-USD ) is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second-largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article, with its launch in July 2015. Ether's price climbed higher, ending above $2,600. ETH is now up ~11% year-to-date. XRP XRP ( XRP-USD ), which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We've included it in this article for reference. XRP is currently down ~14% year-to-date. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Bitcoin tops the chart. In other words, the price of a bitcoin has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies. On January 10th, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).
