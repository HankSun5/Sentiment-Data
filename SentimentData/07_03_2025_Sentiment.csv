41255842,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137668,1741305343,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Threat to US Dollar Dominance: Trump’s Policies Trigger Global Currency Shift, Warns deVere CEO",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-dollar-dominance-trump-policies/,"For cryptocurrency investors, understanding the undercurrents of global finance is crucial. The strength and stability of the US dollar, traditionally seen as a safe-haven asset, often influence broader market sentiment, including the crypto space. But what happens when the seemingly unshakable foundation starts to show cracks? According to Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, former President Donald Trump’s policies are sending tremors through the global financial system, potentially threatening the long-standing US dollar dominance . Is Trump’s Legacy Shaking US Dollar Dominance? Donald Trump’s presidency was marked by unconventional economic policies, from trade wars to significant tax cuts. While these policies had domestic impacts, their reverberations are now being felt on the global stage. Nigel Green of deVere Group suggests that these policies, particularly those related to trade and international relations, are contributing to a reassessment of the US dollar’s global reserve currency status. But how exactly are Trump’s policies impacting the dollar’s standing? Trade Wars and Protectionism: Trump’s imposition of tariffs and trade disputes challenged the established global trade order. This ‘America First’ approach strained relationships with key trading partners and raised questions about the US commitment to multilateralism, a cornerstone of the dollar’s global appeal. Increased National Debt: Large tax cuts under Trump, without corresponding spending cuts, led to a significant increase in the US national debt. Sustained high debt levels can erode confidence in a currency’s long-term value. Unpredictability and Geopolitical Uncertainty: Trump’s foreign policy decisions were often characterized by unpredictability, creating geopolitical uncertainty. In times of global instability, investors typically flock to safe-haven assets, but persistent uncertainty can lead to diversification away from even traditional safe havens like the US dollar. The Rise of Alternatives to Global Reserve Currency The concept of a global reserve currency is rooted in convenience and trust. For decades, the US dollar has served this role due to the size and strength of the US economy, its stable political system, and deep, liquid financial markets. However, if trust erodes, or if alternatives become more attractive, the status quo can be challenged. What are these potential alternatives and why are they gaining traction? Euro: The Eurozone represents a significant economic bloc, and the euro is already the second most widely held reserve currency. While the Eurozone has faced its own challenges, its economic size and the euro’s established presence make it a natural contender. Chinese Yuan (Renminbi): China’s growing economic power is undeniable. The yuan’s internationalization, while still ongoing, is steadily increasing. China’s Belt and Road Initiative and its push for cross-border yuan settlements are gradually expanding the yuan’s global footprint. Digital Currencies and CBDCs: The emergence of cryptocurrencies and the development of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) introduce entirely new possibilities. While still nascent, CBDCs, in particular, could offer governments and central banks alternative tools for international trade and reserves, potentially bypassing traditional systems reliant on the US dollar. Gold and other Commodities: In times of currency instability, traditional safe-haven assets like gold often see renewed interest. While not a currency, gold can act as a store of value and a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. deVere Group’s Perspective on Shifting Financial Markets deVere Group , a leading independent financial advisory organization, is closely monitoring these global economic shifts. Nigel Green’s warnings highlight the potential for significant changes in the financial markets landscape. What does this mean for investors, and what are the key takeaways from deVere’s analysis? Diversification is Key: In an environment of uncertainty, diversification across asset classes and currencies becomes even more critical. Relying solely on dollar-denominated assets may expose investors to unnecessary risks. Geopolitical Awareness: Understanding geopolitical trends and their potential economic impacts is crucial. Events like trade tensions, political instability, and shifts in international alliances can significantly affect currency valuations and market sentiment. Adaptability and Agility: Financial markets are dynamic. Investors need to be adaptable and agile, ready to adjust their strategies in response to evolving global conditions. This includes staying informed about macroeconomic trends and policy changes. Consider Alternative Investments: Exploring alternative investments, including cryptocurrencies, could be a way to diversify portfolios and potentially benefit from new opportunities arising from shifts in the global financial order. Navigating the Future of Global Finance: Actionable Insights The potential weakening of US dollar dominance isn’t necessarily a catastrophic event, but rather a sign of a changing global order. For investors, particularly those in the cryptocurrency space, this shift presents both challenges and opportunities. What actionable steps can you take to navigate this evolving landscape? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of global economic news, geopolitical developments, and policy changes from major economies. Reliable financial news sources and expert analysis are invaluable. Reassess Portfolio Allocation: Review your investment portfolio and consider whether your currency exposure is appropriately diversified. Are you overly reliant on dollar-denominated assets? Explore Crypto’s Role: Consider the potential role of cryptocurrencies in a diversified portfolio. Some cryptocurrencies are seen as uncorrelated assets and potential hedges against traditional market volatility and currency devaluation. Seek Professional Advice: Consult with a qualified financial advisor who understands global macro trends and can help you tailor a strategy to your individual circumstances and risk tolerance. Conclusion: A Paradigm Shift in Global Finance? The era of unquestioned US dollar dominance may be facing its most significant challenge in decades. Trump’s policies, coupled with the rise of alternative economic powers and the emergence of new financial technologies, are creating a more multipolar and potentially less dollar-centric global financial system. While the dollar is unlikely to disappear overnight, investors should be prepared for a world where its influence may gradually diminish. Understanding these shifts and proactively adapting investment strategies will be crucial for navigating the future of global finance and capitalizing on emerging opportunities.

41256957,https://timestabloid.com/?p=59479,1741305610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple Price Prediction: XRP To 30? Ripple Goes Parabolic After Trump Announcement,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-price-prediction-xrp-to-30-ripple-goes-parabolic-after-trump/,"XRP’s explosive 240% surge has sparked bold predictions of a $30 price target. Investors are hopeful, with Trump’s crypto-friendly stance and Ripple’s growing institutional ties fueling speculation. However, regulatory uncertainty and competition cast doubt on whether XRP can sustain its rally. Meanwhile, StratoVM ($SVM) could steal the attention with a staggering 6,223% growth in just two weeks. As a Bitcoin Layer 2, it could introduce smart contracts, DeFi, and AI applications, potentially bridging the gap between Bitcoin’s security and Ethereum’s functionality. Ripple Price Prediction: Is a $30 Price Target Realistic or Just Hype? XRP has experienced a remarkable surge, climbing approximately 240% year-to-date, largely due to optimism surrounding President Donald Trump’s election and the anticipation of a more favorable regulatory environment for digital assets. This bullish trend has led to discussions about XRP’s potential to reach the $30 mark. Analysts point to Ripple’s expanding institutional partnerships and the introduction of the RLUSD stablecoin as factors that could drive XRP’s value higher. On that same note, experts at Coingape foresee that XRP really could reach its 30$ target in 2025. The prediction is further bolstered by Donald Trump’s recent announcement to include US-issued assets like XRP in the Strategic Reserve assets. Trump’s close ties with Ripple officials have fueled optimism among investors. It is also evident by the recent buying trend of the Ripple whales . However, despite these positive developments, XRP’s current price remains significantly below the ambitious $30 target. Market volatility, regulatory challenges, and competition from other cryptocurrencies present substantial hurdles. While the future holds promise, investors should approach such optimistic projections with caution, considering both the potential rewards and inherent risks associated with the cryptocurrency market. Can StratoVM Unlock Bitcoin’s Full Potential? This Layer 2 Solution Thinks It’s Possible Bitcoin has long been the most valuable cryptocurrency, yet its inability to support smart contracts, DeFi, and AI applications has left it lagging behind newer blockchain ecosystems. StratoVM ($SVM) could change that with a Layer 2 solution designed to unlock Bitcoin’s full potential. With a staggering 6223% price surge in just two weeks, according to CoinGecko , StratoVM is proving that demand for Bitcoin-based DeFi is real. For comparison, CoreDAO (another Bitcoin Layer-2) is valued at $990 million, while StratoVM sits at $3.7 million, suggesting plenty of room for future growth. Its technology could enable the seamless integration of smart contracts, meme tokens, and AI applications, potentially combining Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum’s flexibility through EVM compatibility. Developers can now migrate their Ethereum-based projects to Bitcoin, fueling innovation within the ecosystem. SVM 7-day chart, Source: CoinGecko StratoVM’s testnet is already delivering impressive results—processing 56,000 transactions daily and boasting over 113,000 registered wallets. With BTCFi’s total value locked skyrocketing from $307 million to $6.6 billion in a year, according to DeFiLlama , StratoVM could be well-positioned to capitalize on this booming sector. The project’s momentum is undeniable. Over 50 strategic partnerships, nearly 100,000 community members on platforms like X , Telegram , and Discord , and a potential centralized exchange listing are fueling its rapid adoption. Its integration with UniSwap has already increased accessibility, potentially drawing attention from both whales and developers. As Bitcoin evolves beyond being just “digital gold,” StratoVM could play a key role in its transformation. With its mainnet launch approaching, this project might become one of the biggest disruptors in Bitcoin’s history. Final Words XRP’s great year has investors wondering if $30 is within reach, but uncertainty looms. Trump’s support and institutional adoption fuel optimism, yet regulatory hurdles and competition create challenges. Meanwhile, StratoVM could gain more attention with an impressive 6,223% surge. As Bitcoin struggles to support DeFi and smart contracts, StratoVM could appear as a potential game-changer. Remember, this article is not financial or trading advice.

As Cardano grapples with declining retail interest and struggles to hold support at $0.67, and the SUI price shows signs of a potential rally to $16, investors are on the lookout for the next big opportunity. While both Cardano and SUI offer mixed signals, top-performing crypto Web3Bay is quietly building momentum with an impressive presale performance and significant growth potential. Web3Bay’s presale has already raised over $1.6 million, offering early participants the chance to buy 3BAY tokens at $0.00524. Experts predict the launch price could reach $0.1959, delivering a staggering 6,430% ROI. With limited presale opportunities left, the clock is ticking to get in early. Why Web3Bay Could Be the Next Top Performing Crypto of 2025 Web3Bay is making a name for itself with a presale that has raised over $1.6 million and sold 390 million tokens at $0.00524. The platform offers a practical solution to e-commerce challenges by eliminating intermediaries, reducing fees, and supporting both crypto and traditional payment methods like PayPal. Experts predict the token could launch at $0.1959, offering an incredible 6,430% ROI for early backers. In contrast to Cardano, which faces challenges with retail engagement, and SUI, which is heavily dependent on hitting its ambitious price targets, Web3Bay offers immediate and tangible benefits. These include staking rewards, governance rights, and discounts on its decentralized marketplace. This combination of strong ROI potential and practical utility is creating a sense of urgency around Web3Bay’s presale. The presale’s structure also adds to its appeal, with a 15% price increase at each phase. At the projected launch price, a $1,000 investment now could potentially turn into $42,939. This makes Web3Bay not only an attractive opportunity but possibly the best chance to secure a position before it hits the market. Cardano Struggles to Break Key Levels Cardano started 2025 on a challenging note, with its price hovering around $0.67, reflecting a 29.9% drop over the past month. Despite launching new initiatives like the “Cardano Buidler Fest #2” and proposing governance changes through the Plomin hard fork, market sentiment remains bearish. The sharp decline in active addresses to just 24,407 underscores the fading retail interest. Key support at $0.5928 and resistance at $0.6793 could determine ADA’s short-term direction. While Cardano is still focused on long-term development, including partnerships with corporations like Petrobras, its current market performance is underwhelming. Without a significant boost in retail engagement, Cardano might find it difficult to compete against more dynamic networks like SUI and Web3Bay. SUI Price Shows Strength with Potential for 326% Rally Unlike Cardano, the SUI price is holding strong at around $4.10, with analysts predicting a potential rally to $16 by the end of 2025. Technical indicators suggest a 30% short-term rally, with solid support around $4.00 and resistance at $4.67. Increased open interest and growing social dominance further enhance its bullish outlook, positioning SUI as a top performing crypto this year. SUI’s ecosystem is expanding with significant updates, including its integration with Wrapped Bitcoin via the Sui Bridge, contributing to an 8.5% price increase. The network has also surpassed $2 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL), demonstrating strong market participation and community support. As other networks like Cardano struggle, SUI’s robust fundamentals and technical setup make it a promising contender for growth. Summing Up Cardano is struggling to regain momentum, with its price stuck around $0.67 and a decline in active addresses adding to the bearish outlook. Meanwhile, the SUI price is showing strength, trading at approximately $4.10 with the potential to reach $16 by the end of 2025. SUI’s expanding ecosystem and strong technicals position it as a top performing crypto for the year. But with both Cardano and SUI price presenting mixed signals, Web3Bay stands out as a compelling option. Its presale has raised over $1.6 million, selling 390 million tokens at $0.00524, with experts predicting a 6,430% ROI upon launch. As opportunities to join the presale narrow, the chance to secure a position in this potential 2025 breakout star is now.

That’s the vision of Faireez, a groundbreaking startup emerging from stealth mode with a powerful $7.5 million seed funding injection. They’re not just cleaning homes; they’re leveraging the astonishing power of AI to redefine multifamily living, offering a service that feels like a five-star hotel amenity right in your condo building. Let’s dive into how Faireez is poised to transform the chore landscape. Unveiling Faireez: The AI Housekeeping Revolution for Condo Residents Founded in 2023 and based in the bustling heart of New York, Faireez is on a mission to elevate the standard of cleanliness in multifamily buildings. Forget generic cleaning services; Faireez is all about personalization. Their subscription model assigns a dedicated ‘fairy’ – a consistent housekeeper – to each building, ensuring residents receive truly personalized and reliable service. Think of it as your own personal cleaning concierge, just a few taps away on their website or app. What sets Faireez apart? It’s their task-based booking system. Instead of estimating hours, residents select specific chores – daily dishwashing, weekly floor mopping, and more. This transparent approach ensures you pay only for what you need, making smart home cleaning accessible and efficient. PropTech Funding Fuels AI-Driven Innovation While co-founders Omer Agiv and Ori Fingerer are keeping revenue figures close to their chests, their partnerships speak volumes. Faireez has already forged “relationships” with top-tier property management companies and landlords across four states – New York, New Jersey, Florida, and Illinois. These aren’t just any names; we’re talking about industry giants like Silverstein Properties, Charney Companies, and First Service Residential, collectively managing approximately 1 million multifamily units. This impressive traction, combined with the $7.5 million seed funding led by Aristagora VC, underscores the immense potential investors see in Faireez’s vision to revolutionize the condo cleaning service market. The AI Advantage: Transforming Housekeeping with Technology Faireez isn’t just another cleaning service; it’s a tech company at its core, deeply integrating AI housekeeping solutions into its operations. Here’s how they’re leveraging artificial intelligence to create a superior cleaning experience: AI-Powered Auto Scan: Coming later this year, this feature analyzes home videos to craft bespoke cleaning plans. Imagine dynamic pricing based on the actual tasks needed, turning housekeeping into a SKU-based service where every chore has a price tag. Pricing will even adapt to supply and demand, ensuring fairness and efficiency. AI Quality Assurance: Every cleaning visit is meticulously documented with time-stamped before-and-after photos. AI analyzes these images for quality control, ensuring consistency and high standards. Real-time notifications keep residents in the loop, providing peace of mind. Robotic Companions: Looking ahead, Faireez plans to introduce robotic assistants to aid fairies with basic chores. This innovative approach could involve remote operation from locations like Mexico, further enhancing efficiency and scalability. Elevating Housekeepers: Fair Wages and Advanced Tools Faireez partners with established professional cleaning companies, handpicking the top 5% of their employees to become ‘fairies.’ These select individuals receive Faireez protocols, uniforms, and equipment, ensuring a consistent and professional service. Crucially, Faireez claims to pay these fairies 30% to 40% above the market average, alongside bonus opportunities, recognizing and rewarding their crucial role. “The same fairy comes every time, so that builds an element of trust,” explains co-founder Agiv. “And we use an AI-based image engine to make sure that the chores are performed the same way every time. Consistency is very important.” Ambitious Goals and Proven Track Record Faireez has set an ambitious goal: to service one million multifamily units by 2030. With current operations in four states and plans to expand to four more by 2026, focusing on the West Coast next, this vision is rapidly taking shape. This isn’t the founders’ first rodeo either. Agiv and Fingerer previously founded WeissBeerger, an Israeli data company for the beer industry, which sold to Anheuser-Busch for a cool $80 million in 2018. Their history of success in bringing high-tech solutions to traditional industries positions Faireez for significant growth and impact in the automated cleaning sector. Investor Confidence in a Blue Ocean Opportunity Moshe Sarfati, managing partner at Aristagora VC, perfectly encapsulates the excitement around Faireez: “Basically they have what it takes to be a game changer in this ‘blue ocean space of residential buildings’ amenities.” Investors clearly believe Faireez is not just cleaning homes; they are cleaning up in a market ripe for disruption. The combination of PropTech funding , AI innovation, and a focus on personalized service makes Faireez a startup to watch in the evolving landscape of residential amenities. Looking Ahead: The Future of Home Chores? Faireez’s emergence signifies a significant shift in how we think about home cleaning. By blending AI with personalized service and fair labor practices, they are not just making homes cleaner; they are potentially freeing up valuable time for residents and setting a new standard for the industry. As they continue to expand and refine their AI-powered platform, the future of smart home cleaning looks brighter and more efficient than ever before.

The search engine known for its staunch privacy stance is pushing further into the realm of Generative AI, making advanced AI tools more accessible without compromising user data. This shift marks a significant evolution in how we interact with search engines, promising a future where powerful AI assistance and privacy go hand-in-hand. Let’s dive into the exciting developments at DuckDuckGo and explore what this means for you. What’s New with DuckDuckGo AI Chat and Generative AI? DuckDuckGo has been subtly weaving AI into its services for a while now, but recent announcements signal a major acceleration. Their AI Chatbot interface, initially launched in beta as ‘DuckDuckGo AI Chat,’ has officially graduated to become simply Duck.ai . This streamlined name reflects a more mature and integrated AI offering. But the changes go beyond just a name change. DuckDuckGo is also significantly expanding the role of Generative AI within its core search engine at duckduckgo.com , bringing AI-powered summaries directly to your regular search results. Duck.ai: Your Private AI Chatbot Arena Imagine accessing the power of cutting-edge AI models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Meta, all within a privacy-first environment. That’s precisely what Duck.ai offers. This AI Chatbot isn’t just another chatbot; it’s your portal to conversational search powered by the giants of AI, without the privacy strings attached. Here’s what makes Duck.ai stand out: Diverse AI Models: Tap into a range of powerful models including OpenAI’s o3-mini, Meta’s Llama 3.3, and Mistral’s Small 3, ensuring you get the best AI response for your query. Conversational Search: Forget rigid keyword searches. Duck.ai understands natural language, allowing you to ask questions in a conversational style and receive AI-generated answers, not just a list of links. Privacy-Focused: DuckDuckGo emphasizes that Duck.ai allows you to leverage these AI models without being tracked. Your chats are anonymized and never used for AI model training, maintaining your privacy. Free Access (for now): Currently, Duck.ai is free to use, albeit with a daily query limit. DuckDuckGo is considering a paid plan for higher limits and access to even more advanced models. Generative AI in DuckDuckGo Search: A Smarter Search Experience? Beyond Duck.ai, DuckDuckGo is embedding Generative AI more deeply into its traditional search engine. You’ll now encounter AI-assisted answers, in the form of text summaries, appearing above the usual blue links more frequently. According to DuckDuckGo, these AI summaries will appear in over 20% of searches if you choose the ‘often’ setting. This move signifies a significant shift towards AI-enhanced search results, aiming to provide quicker, more direct answers to your queries. Your Privacy, Your Choice: Controlling AI in Your Search While embracing AI Search enhancements, DuckDuckGo remains committed to user agency. You are in control of how much AI influence you want in your search experience. DuckDuckGo offers different frequency settings for AI-generated answers: Sometimes (Default): AI answers appear occasionally. Often: AI answers appear more frequently (over 20% of the time). On-demand: AI answers are available when you specifically request them. Never: Completely disables AI-generated answers in search results. This granular control ensures that you can tailor your search experience to your comfort level with AI assistance. Why is DuckDuckGo Leaning into AI Now? The surge in Generative AI is reshaping the digital landscape, and search engines are at the forefront of this transformation. Google, the dominant search engine, has been rapidly integrating AI into its search results following the explosive popularity of ChatGPT. DuckDuckGo’s move is a clear response to these industry shifts, aiming to stay competitive and relevant in an AI-first world. The DuckDuckGo Privacy Advantage in the AI Era In a market dominated by tech giants, DuckDuckGo’s unique selling proposition remains privacy. They are leveraging this strength to offer a compelling alternative in the AI space. DuckDuckGo argues that it provides access to powerful AI Search tools with reduced privacy risks. You don’t need to create accounts with AI providers to use Duck.ai, and your interactions are anonymized. This is a significant differentiator, especially for privacy-conscious users. Key Privacy Points of Duck.ai: Anonymized Chats: Your chats are proxied and anonymized, preventing them from being directly linked to you. No Training Data: Duck.ai chats are explicitly not used for training AI models, ensuring your conversations don’t contribute to broader AI development in a way that could compromise your data. Local Chat History (Optional): Duck.ai offers a ‘Recent Chats’ feature, but it stores conversations locally on your device, not on DuckDuckGo’s servers, and you can disable this feature entirely. Data Deletion Agreements: DuckDuckGo has agreements with AI model providers to ensure any temporarily saved chats are deleted within 30 days. Seamlessly Switching Between Traditional Search and AI Chat DuckDuckGo is also making it incredibly easy to move between traditional search and AI Chatbot modes. A chat button within the search engine interface allows you to instantly jump to Duck.ai, with your search query pre-filled in the chat prompt. This bi-directional integration allows for a fluid workflow, letting you choose the best approach for each search task. Whether you prefer starting with a conversational AI interaction or traditional search results, DuckDuckGo offers a flexible and integrated experience. Embracing the Best of Both Worlds: AI and Traditional Search DuckDuckGo recognizes that different search needs call for different approaches. Some queries are better suited for the rapid, summary-style answers of AI Search , while others benefit from the in-depth exploration offered by traditional search results. By offering both seamlessly integrated, DuckDuckGo aims to cater to a wider range of user preferences and search styles. And for those who prefer to avoid AI altogether, the ‘never’ option ensures complete control. Expanded Sources and Transparency Initially relying primarily on Wikipedia for AI-assisted answers, DuckDuckGo has broadened its sources to include information from across the web. They also provide “prominent source links” alongside AI answers, enhancing transparency and allowing users to delve deeper into the information underpinning the AI-generated summaries. This commitment to source attribution is crucial for building trust and ensuring users can verify the information provided by AI. Conclusion: DuckDuckGo’s Bold Leap into the Future of Private AI Search DuckDuckGo’s latest moves represent a significant step forward in making Generative AI accessible in a privacy-respecting manner. By enhancing both its dedicated AI Chatbot (Duck.ai) and its traditional search engine with AI capabilities, DuckDuckGo is positioning itself as a leader in the evolving landscape of AI Search . For users who value privacy but also want to leverage the power of AI, DuckDuckGo’s approach offers a compelling and increasingly feature-rich alternative. As AI Chatbot technology continues to advance, DuckDuckGo’s commitment to user agency and data protection sets it apart in a competitive market. The future of search is here, and DuckDuckGo is ensuring privacy remains a central pillar.

US Waives USMCA Tariffs on Mexico, Igniting Global Trade Optimism",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/usmca-tariffs-mexico-trade/,"In a move that has sparked optimism across global trade sectors, the United States has announced a temporary waiver of tariffs on goods from Mexico under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). This significant decision, revealed following a crucial meeting between U.S. officials and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, offers a window of tariff relief until April 2nd. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors closely monitoring global economic shifts, this development could signal potential ripples across markets. Let’s delve into what this tariff waiver means and how it could influence the broader economic landscape. Decoding the USMCA Tariff Waiver: What’s Happening? The announcement, initially reported by Aggr News via X, confirms that the U.S. will temporarily suspend tariffs on Mexican imports within the framework of the USMCA agreement. This decision comes after high-level discussions with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, suggesting a renewed focus on strengthening bilateral trade relations. But what exactly does a tariff waiver entail? Temporary Suspension: The waiver is not permanent; it is currently slated to last until April 2nd. This temporary nature suggests a strategic pause, possibly to assess the broader economic impact or to facilitate ongoing negotiations. USMCA Framework: The waiver operates within the USMCA, a trade agreement designed to foster free trade among the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. This context is crucial as it highlights the importance of regional trade partnerships. Post-Meeting Decision: The timing of the announcement, immediately following a meeting with President Sheinbaum, underscores the diplomatic efforts and discussions that preceded this decision. To understand the significance, let’s briefly look at what USMCA is and why tariffs are relevant in this context. The USMCA, which replaced NAFTA, aims to eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers between the three North American nations. Tariffs are essentially taxes imposed on imported goods, often used to protect domestic industries or as a tool in international trade negotiations. Waiving these USMCA tariffs can have profound effects on trade flows and economic activity. Why Waive Tariffs Now? Exploring the Potential Benefits The decision to waive tariffs, even temporarily, is likely driven by a combination of economic and political factors. What are the potential benefits of this move, and why might the U.S. be choosing this path? Easing Trade Tensions: Tariffs can often be a point of contention in international relations. Waiving them can be seen as a gesture of goodwill, potentially easing trade tensions and fostering a more cooperative environment between the U.S. and Mexico. Boosting Trade Flows: By removing tariffs, the cost of goods traded between the U.S. and Mexico decreases. This can lead to increased trade volumes, benefiting businesses in both countries. More robust Mexico trade is generally seen as a positive economic indicator. Economic Stimulus: Increased trade can act as a stimulus to economic growth. Lower costs for businesses can translate to lower prices for consumers and increased profitability for companies, potentially spurring investment and job creation. Supply Chain Resilience: In a world increasingly focused on supply chain resilience, smoother trade flows with neighboring countries like Mexico can enhance the stability and reliability of supply chains for U.S. businesses. Diplomatic Gains: Waiving tariffs after meeting with President Sheinbaum can strengthen diplomatic ties and build trust, which can be valuable in addressing other bilateral and regional issues. For those in the cryptocurrency space, these broader economic benefits can indirectly impact market sentiment. A stronger, more stable global trade environment often translates to increased investor confidence, which can, in turn, positively influence various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Navigating the Challenges: Potential Downsides and Considerations While the tariff waiver presents numerous potential benefits, it’s crucial to also consider potential challenges and downsides. What are some of the concerns or considerations that might accompany this decision? Temporary Nature: The waiver is only until April 2nd. This short timeframe introduces uncertainty. Businesses need clarity and predictability for long-term planning, and a temporary waiver might not provide sufficient reassurance. Impact on Domestic Industries: Tariffs are sometimes used to protect domestic industries from foreign competition. Waiving tariffs could, in theory, put some U.S. industries at a disadvantage if Mexican imports become significantly cheaper. However, within the USMCA framework, this is likely to be carefully balanced. Geopolitical Factors: International trade decisions are rarely purely economic. Geopolitical considerations, such as broader U.S.-Mexico relations, immigration policies, and regional stability, likely play a role. Changes in these areas could influence future tariff policies. Market Volatility: While increased trade is generally positive, sudden shifts in trade policy can sometimes introduce short-term market volatility as businesses and investors adjust to the new landscape. Enforcement and Compliance: Even with a waiver, ensuring compliance with trade agreements and preventing unfair trade practices remains essential. Robust mechanisms for monitoring and enforcement are necessary to realize the intended benefits. For cryptocurrency markets, any significant economic policy shift can introduce volatility. Traders and investors should remain vigilant and monitor market reactions to this USMCA tariffs impact news. Real-World Examples: How Tariff Waivers Have Played Out To better understand the potential effects of this tariff waiver , let’s look at some historical examples of tariff reductions or waivers and their outcomes: Example Context Outcome Post-WWII Tariff Reductions (GATT/WTO) Gradual reduction of tariffs globally under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and later the World Trade Organization (WTO). Significant increase in global trade, economic growth, and interconnectedness. Lower consumer prices in many sectors. EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement Elimination of tariffs on most goods traded between the European Union and South Korea. Substantial growth in trade volume between the EU and South Korea. Increased competitiveness for businesses in both regions. Temporary Tariff Suspensions (Various Countries) Countries often temporarily suspend tariffs on specific goods during times of shortage or economic stress. Immediate relief to consumers and industries reliant on the tariffed goods. Can help stabilize prices and supply chains in the short term. These examples illustrate that tariff waivers and reductions, when implemented strategically, can lead to positive outcomes in terms of trade growth and economic benefits. However, the temporary nature of the current USMCA waiver means its long-term impact will depend on future policy decisions. Actionable Insights: What Should Businesses and Investors Do? Given this development, what are some actionable insights for businesses and investors, particularly those in the cryptocurrency and broader financial markets? Monitor Trade Data: Keep a close watch on trade data between the U.S. and Mexico in the coming months. Increased trade volumes will be a key indicator of the waiver’s effectiveness. Assess Supply Chain Impacts: Businesses with supply chains that involve Mexico should assess how this waiver might reduce costs or improve efficiency. Explore opportunities to strengthen these links. Evaluate Market Sentiment: Gauge market sentiment in both traditional and cryptocurrency markets. Positive reactions to the news could present trading or investment opportunities. Stay Informed on Policy: This is a temporary waiver. Stay informed about future trade policy announcements and discussions between the U.S. and Mexico. Long-term policy direction is crucial. Diversify Risk: As always, diversification remains a key strategy. While positive trade developments are encouraging, economic and political landscapes can shift rapidly. Diversification across asset classes and geographies is prudent. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope for Global Trade? The U.S. decision to waive USMCA tariffs on Mexico until April 2nd is a noteworthy development in the realm of global trade. It signals a potential easing of trade tensions and a renewed focus on fostering stronger economic ties within North America. While the temporary nature of the waiver introduces some uncertainty, the potential benefits in terms of increased global trade , economic stimulus, and improved diplomatic relations are significant. For the cryptocurrency market and the broader financial world, this news offers a glimmer of hope amidst ongoing economic complexities. The coming months will be crucial in observing the real-world impacts of this policy shift and understanding the direction of future trade relations. This move could be a stepping stone towards more stable and prosperous Mexico trade relations, benefiting both economies and potentially contributing to a more positive global economic outlook.

US President Donald Trump Signs Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Executive Order,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/breaking-we-are-witnessing-a-historic-moment-us-president-donald-trump-signs-bitcoin-strategic-reserve-executive-order/,"According to the latest information, US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the US. However, the reserve will not acquire Bitcoin other than those seized by the government. Details were conveyed by US cryptocurrency chief David Sacks via X. Sacks noted that the reserve would be funded by Bitcoins seized by the federal government through criminal or civil asset forfeiture, and therefore would not impose any additional cost on taxpayers. According to current estimates, the U.S. government owns about 200,000 Bitcoins, but a full audit of these assets has never been done before. The new decree calls for a comprehensive accounting of the federal government’s digital assets. Bitcoins in the reserve will not be sold and will be held as a store of value, likening the reserve to a digital Fort Knox for cryptocurrencies dubbed “digital gold.” Sacks stated that early Bitcoin sales cost US taxpayers over $17 billion in value losses and that with this new strategy, the government aims to maximize the value of its assets. In addition, the Treasury and Commerce Departments were given the authority to develop budget-neutral strategies that do not impose additional costs on American taxpayers. The executive order also includes the creation of a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, comprised of digital assets other than Bitcoin seized through criminal or civil proceedings. The government will not acquire additional assets for this stockpile outside of forfeiture proceedings, and the purpose of the stockpile will be responsible stewardship of government digital assets under the Treasury Department. Sacks emphasized that President Trump fulfilled his promises to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile, underlining his commitment to making the US the “crypto capital of the world” with this executive order. He also thanked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Task Force Executive Director Bo Hines for their support. *This is not investment advice.

Traders Deploy $150M Leverage after Ripple CEO’s White House Invite Confirmation,https://coingape.com/markets/xrp-price-forecast-traders-ripple-ceo-white-house-summit/,"Ripple (XRP) price soared to $2.70 on Thursday, surging 19% in 24 hours as investors responded to U.S. trade tariff updates and rising anticipation ahead of the White House Crypto Summit on March 7. With XRP bulls maintaining dominance in derivatives markets, leveraged long positions now total $150 million, signaling continued upside potential. Ripple (XRP) Outperforms Bitcoin and Ethereum Ahead of White House Crypto Summit XRP faced stiff resistance at the $3 level after Trump’s announced the strategic crypto reserve on March. However, renewed volatility from shifting U.S. trade policies has strengthened bullish sentiment leading into the summit. If momentum persists, XRP could challenge long-term resistance above $3. Ripple (XRP) Price Action The latest market data indicates a strong influx of buyers, propelling XRP beyond $2.70 as investors execute last-minute trades ahead of today’s high-profile summit. Ripple CEO Confirms Attendance at White House Crypto Summit Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed his participation in the White House Crypto Summit, reinforcing the company’s growing engagement with the Trump administration’s digital asset policies. ” I’ve had some new confirmations for Friday’s White House Crypto Summit. As of this morning, invites were still rolling out. .” FOX report Eleanor Terret Confirmed Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse attendance at White House Crypto Summit, in a March 6 post on X . The summit, led by Trump’s AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks, will feature major industry figures, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor. Discussions will center on regulatory frameworks and a proposed U.S. crypto reserve. Ripple price , already up 19% on Thursday has outperformed Bitcoin’s 4% dip. The affirms investor optimism surrounding the summit’s potential impact on Ripple’s institutional adoption. Analysts suggest a breakout beyond $3 could materialize if policy discussions favor digital asset integration into financial markets. What is the White House Crypto Summit, and How Could It Be Bullish for XRP? The White House Crypto Summit is a pivotal event where key industry leaders and policymakers discuss the future of cryptocurrency regulations in the U.S. Topics include the establishment of a national crypto reserve and clearer guidelines for institutional adoption. For XRP, the summit’s significance lies in its potential to reshape market sentiment. If Ripple gains regulatory clarity or is formally integrated into the proposed reserve, XRP could experience sustained bullish momentum, with traders eyeing a move toward $5. XRP Liquidation Map | March 6 Going by trends observed in Coinglass ‘ latest derivatives market data, majority of XRP short-term traders are anticipated a positive outcome from the summit. As seen in the chart above, XRP long leverage has crossed the $150 million mark at press time on March 6, towering above the active short contracts which currently stands at $115 million. With long leverage outpacing short by more than 20%, the short-term momentum remains largely bullish. However, if negative readings from Non-Farm Payrolls report overshadow headlines from the White House Crypto summit, XRP price risks rapid corrections if the over-leveraged bulls are liquidated. XRP Price Eyes $5 as Bulls Retain Control Ahead of White House Crypto Summit XRP price is holding strong above $2.60, gaining 19% in just two days as technical indicators flash bullish signals. The Parabolic SAR dots remain positioned below price action, confirming the prevailing uptrend, while the MACD histogram shows expanding green bars, signaling strengthening bullish momentum. The MACD line has crossed above the signal line, reinforcing the possibility of a sustained rally. A decisive close above the $2.70 resistance zone could set the stage for a retest of the psychological $3 level, where prior rejection occurred following Trump’s crypto reserve announcement. If bulls maintain control, breaking past $3 could expose XRP to an extended breakout toward the $5 mark in the coming weeks. XRP price analysis | XRPUSD However, failure to hold above the $2.60 level may invite bearish pressure, potentially leading to a retest of the $2.10 support level, where buyers previously stepped in to propel the recent surge. The increasing leverage in long positions, now at $150 million, suggests that market sentiment is skewed toward the upside, but it also introduces liquidation risks if volatility spikes. As the White House Crypto Summit unfolds, XRP’s reaction to regulatory developments could dictate the next major move, with bullish momentum favoring a continued uptrend. The post XRP Price to $5?

Several Key Bitcoin Metrics Are Pointing At The Same Price Range Right Now In its latest weekly report, Glassnode has discussed the Bitcoin investor cost basis from various angles. The first indicator that the analytics firm has shared is the “UTXO Realized Price Distribution” (URPD), that basically tells us about how the BTC supply is distributed among the different price levels based on the last transaction value. Related Reading: Litecoin Whale Deposits 500,000 LTC To Binance: Price Decline To Extend? First, here is how this metric looked before the recent price crash: As is visible in the chart, very few coins had their cost basis between $70,000 and $92,000 before the crash. In on-chain analysis, investor cost basis is considered an important topic, as holders are more likely to make some kind of move when their profit-loss status is threatened. Since this range contained the acquisition level of only a small part of the supply, it was sort of an “air-gap” in terms of potential demand. This may be why BTC easily slipped deep into this region when the crash came. So far, though, the bulls have come through in providing support, as they have since participated in some buying in this vacant region, changing the URPD. Thus, the range is now better set up to provide support than before, although it’s still sort of an empty region when compared to the other Bitcoin cost basis centers. The second indicator that Glassnode has talked about is the Realized Price of the short-term holders. The “Realized Price” is a term that was also in the full form of URPD. What this metric measures is the cost basis of the average investor belonging to a part of the BTC userbase. Below is a chart that shows the trend in the indicator for the short-term holders (STHs), who are the Bitcoin investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. “The Short-Term Holder cost basis has historically acted as an important reference level across bull-market uptrends,” notes the analytics firm. “We have calculated the ±1σ bands of the Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis, which have typically acted as a sort of upper and lower bound for local price action.” Interestingly, this lower bound, that is, the level one standard deviation below the STH Realized Price, is situated at $71,000 right now. This is about the same level as where the previously mentioned air-gap area ends. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Stop: $75,500? Analyst Reveals Historical ‘Magnet’ Level This isn’t the only other place where this level shows up, as the chart for the Active Realized Price shows. The “Active Realized Price” basically takes the Realized Price of the entire BTC network, with an added twist. The metric only includes the ‘economical’ supply, meaning that it excludes for the part of the supply that Glassnode has determined to be unlikely to return back into circulation. At present, the Active Realized Price stands at $70,000, which is once again nearly the same level as the one from the other two indicators. “With significant confluence across several key cost basis metrics, this price region becomes an area of interest, perhaps being the final defence line for the bulls in the event of a complete capitulation,” concludes the report. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $90,000, up almost 5% in the last week.

According to CryptoQuant analyst Darkfrost, this increase in the Binance stablecoin reserve marks a good omen for a positive market rebound. With volatility swaying the market in recent times, it remains to be seen what direction Bitcoin and altcoins will take moving forward. Binance Stablecoin Reserve and Market Shift Per the CryptoQuant data , the ERC-20 stablecoin on Binance has surpassed the $31.3 billion threshold. Darkfrost noted that a bump in the Binance stablecoin reserve often indicates positive momentum. The CryptoQuant analyst attributed the massive Binance stablecoin inflow to two major reasons. These include channeling liquidity into the top crypto trading exchange in preparation for potential market entry. According to Darkfrost, this trend reflects confidence in the market and the exchange. Beyond the influence of third-party investors, Binance could also be consolidating its stablecoin reserve amid a boost in market demand. The stablecoin reserve, per the chart shared by Darkfrost, has been on an upward trend since July 2024. The previous peak recorded onchain came around December 2022. Binance Stablecoin Implication for Bitcoin As the CryptoQuant analyst noted, periods of positive shift in the asset’s reserve often come with a massive push in the price of Bitcoin. “Historically, periods of rising stablecoin reserves on Binance have often coincided with, or even preceded, an increase in BTC prices and a broader upswing in the crypto market,” Darkfrost said in his note. The market has been quite unstable in the past few weeks, with volatility defining the order. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was changing hands for $90,511.91, up marginally by 0.18% in 24 hours. Bitcoin price entered a risky zone earlier as Crypto Czar David Sacks blamed the Biden administration for selling BTC too early. This Bitcoin sentiment and uncertainty around the forthcoming White House Digital Asset Summit fuels market drawdown. Market Dynamics and Trends to Watch While the Binance exchange has enjoyed dominance in trading volume, including the stablecoin market, the trend is set to change. Based on the Markets In Crypto Asset (MiCA) legislation, the exchange has set March 31 to delist non-MiCA compliant tokens . Some ERC-20 tokens, including USDT and EURI, will stop trading on the exchange. This might impact the exchange’s growing stablecoin reserve, which may, in turn, impact the broader market dynamics, as Darkfrost teased.

At this point, all of the assets contemplated by the order would be those seized in civil or criminal forfeitures. The bitcoin will be stored for long-term value in what was termed a ""digital Fort Knox."" ""The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings,"" said David Sacks, Trump's crypto czar, in a statement posted on social media site X. In a video showing the president signing the order , Trump says about establishing the reserve, ""Made the promise, right?"" The order has also nudged government officials to seek ways to add more bitcoin to the reserve, as long as it doesn't harm the federal budget. ""The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers,"" Sacks said. The assets for the non-bitcoin stockpile will be any crypto that the government otherwise seizes. Sacks didn't highlight any particular asset names in that category, despite some being recently highlighted by the president. Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer for Bitwise Asset Management, said in a post that the move to set up a bitcoin reserve reduces the chance the government can ever try to outlaw the asset, and it ""dramatically increases the likelihood that other nations will establish strategic bitcoin reserves.""But Charles Edwards, founder of Bitcoin-focused hedge fund Capriole Investments, called it the ""most underwhelming and disappointing outcome we could have expected for this week,"" arguing that without a buying plan, the strategy is a ""pig in lipstick.""

41257157,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137696,1741307730,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Superstate’s Bold Move: SEC Greenlights Digital Transfer Agent in Crypto Revolution,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-greenlights-digital-transfer-agent/,"In a landmark move signaling the growing maturity of the digital asset space, blockchain-based asset management firm Superstate has achieved a significant milestone. They’ve successfully registered their digital transfer agent, Superstate Services LLC, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This pivotal development, first reported by CoinDesk, underscores the increasing convergence of tokenized assets with established financial regulatory frameworks. Is this the bridge the crypto world has been waiting for to fully integrate with traditional finance? Let’s dive into the details. What is a Digital Transfer Agent and Why Does SEC Registration Matter? To understand the magnitude of Superstate’s achievement, it’s crucial to grasp the role of a digital transfer agent . In traditional finance, transfer agents are the unsung heroes who maintain records of stock owners, process stock transfers, and manage dividend distributions. Now, imagine this crucial function being adapted for the burgeoning world of digital assets and tokenized securities. That’s precisely what a digital transfer agent does – it provides these essential services for blockchain-based assets. SEC registration for a digital transfer agent is not just a formality; it’s a powerful validation. It signifies that Superstate Services LLC has met the stringent regulatory standards set by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This stamp of approval brings a layer of trust and legitimacy to the often-complex and sometimes opaque world of crypto. Think of it as a regulatory green light, paving the way for broader adoption and acceptance of tokenized assets within the existing financial ecosystem. Here’s a breakdown of why SEC registration is a game-changer: Enhanced Trust and Credibility: SEC oversight provides investors and institutions with confidence in the operations and compliance of the digital transfer agent. Regulatory Clarity: Registration offers a clear framework for Superstate to operate within, minimizing legal uncertainties and fostering a compliant environment. Institutional Adoption Catalyst: For institutional investors hesitant to enter the crypto space due to regulatory concerns, SEC-registered entities like Superstate Services LLC can lower the barrier to entry. Market Growth and Maturity: This move contributes to the overall maturation of the digital asset market, demonstrating a commitment to regulatory compliance and long-term sustainability. Tokenized Assets: The Future of Finance? At the heart of this development lies the concept of tokenized assets . But what exactly are they, and why are they gaining traction? In simple terms, tokenization is the process of representing real-world assets – from real estate and art to commodities and securities – as digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens can then be easily traded, managed, and fractionalized, unlocking a new realm of possibilities. Tokenized assets offer several compelling advantages: Benefit Description Increased Liquidity Tokenization can make traditionally illiquid assets, like real estate, more easily tradable and accessible to a wider range of investors. Fractional Ownership High-value assets can be divided into smaller, more affordable fractions, allowing smaller investors to participate. Enhanced Transparency Blockchain technology provides a transparent and immutable record of ownership and transactions. Streamlined Processes Tokenization can automate and simplify many of the cumbersome processes associated with traditional asset management, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. Global Accessibility Tokenized assets can be traded and accessed globally, breaking down geographical barriers and expanding market reach. Superstate’s registration as a digital transfer agent is a crucial step towards realizing the full potential of tokenized assets . By providing the necessary infrastructure for managing these digital securities in a compliant and regulated manner, Superstate is helping to bridge the gap between the promise of blockchain and the realities of traditional finance.

As AI technologies like those developed by OpenAI mature, their potential impact on digital currencies and decentralized systems is undeniable. However, recent controversies surrounding AI safety practices at leading AI firms are raising eyebrows and sparking debate within the tech community and beyond. A prominent voice in this debate is Miles Brundage, former policy lead at OpenAI, who is now publicly challenging the company’s narrative on AI history and its approach to GPT-2 deployment. Let’s delve into the heart of this controversy and understand what it means for the future of AI development and its intersection with the crypto world. Why is OpenAI Accused of ‘Rewriting’ its AI History? The core of the issue lies in a recently published document by OpenAI outlining their current philosophy on AI safety and alignment. In this document, OpenAI suggests a shift in perspective regarding the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). They now frame AGI as part of a “continuous path” of AI advancement, advocating for iterative deployment and learning from current AI systems. This contrasts with what they describe as a “discontinuous world” approach, which they claim they adopted for their earlier model, GPT-2 . According to OpenAI, in this discontinuous world, caution was paramount, leading them to treat systems like GPT-2 with “outsized caution.” Here’s a breakdown of OpenAI’s stated positions: Discontinuous World (GPT-2 Era): Characterized by treating early AI systems with significant caution due to perceived risks, even if those risks seemed disproportionate in hindsight. Continuous World (Current Philosophy): Views AGI development as a gradual progression. Emphasizes learning and iterative improvement through deployment of current systems to ensure the safety of future, more advanced AI. However, this narrative is being challenged by Miles Brundage, OpenAI’s former policy research head, who argues that OpenAI is misrepresenting the context of GPT-2 ‘s release and its alignment with their current “iterative deployment” philosophy. Miles Brundage’s Powerful Criticism: What’s the Real Story of GPT-2 and AI Safety? Miles Brundage , who was deeply involved in OpenAI’s GPT-2 release strategy, took to social media platform X to voice his concerns. He contends that the cautious and incremental release of GPT-2 was entirely consistent with, and even foreshadowed, OpenAI’s present-day iterative deployment approach. Brundage highlights that: GPT-2’s Incremental Release: The model was not fully released immediately. Instead, OpenAI opted for a phased rollout, sharing lessons and insights at each stage. Expert Support for Caution: Many security experts at the time applauded OpenAI’s cautious approach to GPT-2 , recognizing the potential risks associated with such powerful language models. Brundage firmly believes that the caution exercised during the GPT-2 release was justified given the information available at the time. He questions OpenAI’s current characterization of that period as belonging to a “discontinuous world” approach, arguing that it was, in fact, an early example of the iterative deployment strategy they now champion. The GPT-2 Context: Why Was There So Much AI Safety Concern? To understand Brundage’s perspective, it’s crucial to remember the environment surrounding GPT-2 in 2019. GPT-2 was a significant leap forward in AI text generation. It could perform tasks previously thought to be uniquely human, such as: Answering questions on a wide range of topics. Summarizing lengthy articles. Generating human-quality text that was, at times, indistinguishable from human writing. Despite seeming less sophisticated by today’s standards, GPT-2 was groundbreaking at the time. OpenAI , acknowledging the potential for misuse, initially chose not to release the full source code, citing risks of malicious applications like generating fake news or spam. This decision, while debated, underscores the genuine AI safety concerns prevalent at the time. What are Brundage’s Fears About OpenAI’s Current Stance on AI Safety? Miles Brundage worries that OpenAI’s recent document is designed to shift the burden of proof regarding AI safety concerns. He fears that OpenAI is attempting to create an environment where: Concerns are Dismissed as Alarmist: Legitimate worries about AI safety might be downplayed or labeled as exaggerated. High Evidence Threshold: Action on AI safety would only be taken when there is “overwhelming evidence of imminent dangers.” Brundage argues that this mentality is “very dangerous,” especially as AI systems become increasingly advanced and potentially impactful. He questions OpenAI’s motives for “poo-pooing caution” and wonders if it signals a shift towards prioritizing rapid product releases over comprehensive AI safety measures. Are Competitive Pressures Affecting OpenAI’s AI Safety Priorities? There’s a growing narrative that competitive pressures in the AI industry might be influencing OpenAI ‘s approach to AI safety . OpenAI has faced accusations in the past of prioritizing “shiny products” and rushing releases to outpace competitors. This pressure has only intensified with the rise of competitors like Chinese AI lab DeepSeek, whose R1 model has reportedly matched OpenAI’s o1 model in certain benchmarks. Adding to the pressure, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has admitted that DeepSeek has narrowed OpenAI’s technological lead. Furthermore, reports suggest OpenAI is facing significant financial losses, projected to potentially triple to $14 billion annually by 2026. In this context, a faster product release cycle could offer short-term financial benefits but might compromise long-term AI safety considerations. The Bigger AI Safety Debate: Balancing Innovation and Responsibility The disagreement between Miles Brundage and OpenAI highlights a fundamental tension in the AI field: balancing rapid innovation with responsible development and deployment. Experts like Brundage are raising critical questions about whether the current race to dominate the AI market is overshadowing crucial AI safety protocols. The concerns are not just about technical safeguards but also about the broader ethical and societal implications of increasingly powerful AI systems. As the crypto and blockchain space increasingly integrates AI, these AI safety debates become even more relevant. The security and reliability of decentralized systems could be profoundly affected by the underlying AI technologies they utilize. Therefore, understanding and engaging with the discussions around AI history , AI safety , and responsible development is crucial for anyone involved in the future of digital currencies and beyond. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for AI Safety and OpenAI’s Path Forward The critique from Miles Brundage serves as a stark reminder that the path to advanced AI is not just about technological breakthroughs but also about navigating complex ethical and AI safety landscapes. As OpenAI and other AI leaders continue to shape the future of this transformative technology, the debate over AI history , deployment strategies, and the prioritization of AI safety will remain central. The crypto community, with its inherent focus on security and decentralization, has a vested interest in ensuring these discussions are robust and lead to responsible AI innovation.

Russia, facing a barrage of international sanctions, is turning to digital assets as a potential workaround. But can sanctions truly cripple a nation’s access to the decentralized world of crypto? A prominent Russian lawmaker suggests otherwise, sparking a crucial debate about the limitations of financial restrictions in the age of blockchain. Let’s delve into the details of Russia’s evolving crypto strategy and what it means for the global financial landscape. Can Sanctions Truly Block Russia from Crypto? Anton Gorelkin, a Russian lawmaker, recently stated that sanctions are not a foolproof method to completely isolate Russia from the cryptocurrency sphere. This assertion comes amidst escalating efforts from international bodies to tighten the screws on Russia’s financial access. Gorelkin’s perspective highlights a critical challenge in the digital age: the decentralized and borderless nature of cryptocurrencies. While traditional financial systems are susceptible to sanctions, the crypto ecosystem presents a different playing field. Here’s a breakdown of why completely cutting off Russia from crypto is proving to be a complex task: Decentralization: Cryptocurrencies, by design, operate without central intermediaries like banks. This decentralized nature makes it difficult for any single entity to control or block transactions. Global Reach: Crypto transactions can occur across borders with relative ease. While exchanges can be regulated, peer-to-peer transactions and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) offer alternative routes. Technological Adaptability: The crypto space is constantly evolving. New tools and methods are continuously emerging, making it challenging for regulators to keep pace and enforce restrictions comprehensively. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge that sanctions do have an impact. The effectiveness of sanctions in the crypto context is not about complete blockage but rather about increasing friction and costs, and limiting access to certain regulated platforms and stablecoins like USDT. The Role of Russian Crypto Regulation in Navigating Sanctions Russia’s approach to crypto regulation has been evolving, particularly in light of international sanctions. Initially hesitant, the Russian government has gradually warmed up to the idea of digital assets, especially for international trade and mining. This shift is partly driven by the need to find alternative financial channels in the face of restrictions. Key regulatory developments in Russia’s crypto landscape include: Legalization of Crypto Mining: Russia has officially legalized cryptocurrency mining, recognizing it as an economic activity. This move aims to leverage Russia’s energy resources and attract investments in the crypto sector. Crypto for International Trade: Despite previous reservations, Russia has authorized the use of cryptocurrencies for international trade settlements. This is a significant step towards using crypto to bypass traditional financial systems and sanctions. Ongoing Regulatory Framework Development: Russia is still in the process of developing a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. This includes clarifying the legal status of crypto assets, taxation, and consumer protection measures. While these regulatory steps indicate a pro-crypto stance, the actual implementation and effectiveness in circumventing sanctions remain to be seen. The global crypto ecosystem is also subject to international regulations and compliance standards, which could pose challenges for Russia’s ambitions. Why is Cryptocurrency Russia Still Pursuing Digital Assets? Despite international pressure and sanctions, cryptocurrency Russia is increasingly embracing digital assets. This strategic pivot is driven by a combination of factors, highlighting the potential benefits Russia sees in the crypto space: Benefit Description Sanctions Evasion Cryptocurrencies offer a potential alternative to traditional financial channels that are subject to sanctions. They can facilitate cross-border transactions with less reliance on sanctioned banks and payment systems. International Trade Using crypto for international trade can help Russia bypass restrictions on SWIFT and other international payment networks, enabling continued commerce with willing partners. Financial Innovation Embracing crypto can foster innovation in Russia’s financial sector, attracting tech talent and potentially creating new economic opportunities. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Exploring DeFi applications could provide Russia with access to alternative financial services and investment opportunities outside the traditional regulated system. However, pursuing a crypto strategy is not without its challenges. Russia needs to navigate regulatory hurdles, ensure cybersecurity, and manage the volatility inherent in the crypto market. Furthermore, the international community is closely monitoring Russia’s crypto activities, and further measures to tighten crypto-related sanctions cannot be ruled out. USDT Sanctions Impact : A Less Viable Option for Russia? According to Anton Gorelkin, USDT (Tether), a popular stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, is becoming a less viable option for Russia in the context of sanctions. This is primarily due to: Centralized Nature of USDT: Unlike truly decentralized cryptocurrencies, USDT is issued and controlled by Tether Limited, a centralized entity. This makes it susceptible to regulatory pressure and potential blacklisting of specific addresses or users. Regulatory Scrutiny: Stablecoins, including USDT, are facing increasing regulatory scrutiny globally. Concerns about transparency, reserves, and potential illicit use are prompting authorities to tighten regulations. Dependence on the US Dollar: As USDT is pegged to the US dollar, its value and accessibility are inherently linked to the US financial system. This dependence makes it less attractive for countries seeking to reduce reliance on the dollar in the face of US sanctions. The recent EU sanctions targeting Garantex, a crypto exchange reportedly popular in Russia, further underscore the increasing pressure on crypto platforms facilitating transactions involving sanctioned entities. While USDT remains widely used, its long-term viability for Russia as a sanctions workaround is increasingly questionable. Alternative stablecoins or decentralized cryptocurrencies might become more appealing in this context. Crypto International Trade Russia : A Bold but Challenging Path Russia’s move to legalize crypto international trade Russia represents a bold attempt to adapt to the new geopolitical reality. Using cryptocurrencies for cross-border payments could offer several advantages: Reduced Reliance on Traditional Banking: Crypto transactions can bypass traditional banks, which are often intermediaries in international trade and susceptible to sanctions. Faster and Cheaper Transactions: Crypto transactions can be faster and potentially cheaper than traditional international wire transfers, especially for smaller businesses. Access to Unbanked Markets: Cryptocurrencies can facilitate trade with countries that have limited access to traditional banking infrastructure. However, implementing crypto for international trade at scale presents significant hurdles: Volatility: The price volatility of many cryptocurrencies poses a challenge for trade settlements. Stablecoins can mitigate this risk, but their regulatory status and centralization concerns remain. Regulatory Compliance: Businesses engaging in crypto international trade still need to navigate anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations in different jurisdictions. Adoption and Infrastructure: Widespread adoption of crypto for international trade requires building the necessary infrastructure, educating businesses, and overcoming inertia in traditional trade practices. Despite these challenges, Russia’s foray into crypto for international trade signals a significant shift and could potentially inspire other nations facing similar geopolitical pressures to explore digital asset solutions. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Sanctions Maze The situation surrounding crypto sanctions Russia is complex and rapidly evolving. While sanctions can create obstacles and increase friction, they are unlikely to completely block Russia’s access to the crypto world. Russia’s legalization of mining and crypto for international trade demonstrates a proactive approach to leveraging digital assets in a challenging economic environment. However, the effectiveness of this strategy will depend on various factors, including the global regulatory landscape, technological advancements in the crypto space, and the evolving nature of international sanctions. The case of Russia highlights the inherent tension between the decentralized nature of crypto and the centralized control mechanisms of traditional finance and geopolitics. As nations grapple with these complexities, the future of crypto in international relations and economic sanctions will undoubtedly be a space to watch closely.

The upcoming summit could introduce tax benefits, driving institutional adoption. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta forecasts a 2.8% Q1 GDP decline, raising economic concerns. Although Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains positive, broader economic concerns and increasing volatility suggest potential price swings in the near term. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is currently trading at $86,295, reflecting a 4.25% decline in the last 24 hours as selling pressure intensifies. The cryptocurrency was rejected at $89,998, turning that level into a key resistance, reinforcing a short-term bearish trend.

If Bitcoin fails to hold $84,351, it could decline further toward $81,461 and $78,111. However, a rebound above $88,574 could revive buying interest, setting up a potential retest of $89,998 and $94,381. Key Insights: Bitcoin fell 4.25% to $86,295, breaking below the 50-day EMA at $88,574. A bearish engulfing candle signals potential further downside toward $84,351. A recovery above $88,574 could push BTC back toward resistance at $89,998.

White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, wrote in a post on X that the reserve will be funded exclusively with Bitcoin seized in criminal and civil forfeiture cases, ensuring that taxpayers bear no financial burden. Just a few minutes ago, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it… — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 7, 2025 Trump’s crypto reserve plan sparks debate among Bitcoin purists Estimates suggest the U.S. government holds around 200,000 Bitcoin, though no full audit has been conducted. Trump’s order calls for a comprehensive review of federal digital asset holdings and bans the sale of Bitcoin from the reserve, establishing it as a long-term store of value. Moreover, the order establishes a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, managed by the Treasury Department, to hold other confiscated cryptocurrencies. Several crypto investors who have supported Trump raised concerns over the weekend after the president said in a post on Truth Social that in addition to BTC, ETH, XRP, Solana’s SOL token, and Cardano’s ADA coin would be part of a strategic crypto reserve. “I have nothing against XRP, SOL, or ADA, but I do not think they are suitable for a Strategic Reserve,” bitcoin billionaire Tyler Winklevoss wrote. “Only one digital asset in the world right now meets the bar, and that digital asset is Bitcoin.” Bitcoin-only reserve plan strengthens U.S. position as a crypto powerhouse Before the announcement, Castle Island Ventures’ Nic Carter said that a U.S. commitment to a Bitcoin-only reserve would solidify Bitcoin as a significant global asset comparable to gold. Carter stressed that the U.S., as the biggest nation in the world, is a key driver of Bitcoin’s legitimacy. Restricting the reserve to Bitcoin reinforces its position as a major asset, while allowing other digital currencies into the reserve would have forced it to look like a speculative fund. Ryan Gilbert, a fintech investor, said that the move would send a strong message to institutions that Bitcoin was here to stay and would further differentiate it from other cryptocurrencies. Gilbert said that for 15 years now, many people have said that Bitcoin is the only digital asset and that all other tokens should be ignored. He believes this will help separate Bitcoin from other sophisticated coins in their tussles, ensuring Bitcoin maintains its position in the debate. Even so, Gilbert warned that the U.S. needs to be judicious in how it receives such reserve. He also stressed that the U.S. should not actively trade Bitcoin because the reserve is intended to be a long-term store of value and not to catalyze market speculation. Sacks lauded the decision, describing it as a “milestone” in establishing the U.S. as the “crypto capital of the world.” He has previously pointed out that the U.S. missed out on more than $17 billion in lost value by selling off seized Bitcoin too early. According to Sacks, further policy development will center on budget-neutral acquisition strategies for Bitcoin, which Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick will oversee. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve eases $18B sell pressure, says Coinbase exec According to Coinbase executive Conor Grogan, U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve may relieve massive sell-side pressure. “By my estimation, the [U.S. government] owns 198.109k BTC. This executive order removes ~$18B of sell-side pressure,” said Grogan, Coinbase’s Director of Product Strategy and Business Operations, in a post to X on Thursday. Arkham Intelligence data shows that the U.S. government currently holds about 198,109 BTC, 122 million USDT and 56,035 ETH , among other tokens. Following the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve announcement, Bitcoin extended its losses, tumbling 5.7% in under an hour. The drop followed Bitcoin’s rise earlier in the week, which was above $92,000, based on speculation around the initiative. But the rally has since lost steam as traders book profits and reassess the market impact of the government’s new digital asset policy. Bitcoin has since recovered some to $87,200, according to CoinGecko data. Ethereum was down 6.1% at $2,100, while Solana and Dogecoin fell 6.8% and 5.8%, respectively. Binance’s BNB declined 3.6% to $576 and Cardano shed 13.8% to $0.81, among the biggest losers among major tokens.

This milestone follows the Community Meme Coin (CMC/USDT), which is surpassing big projects in the endless race for social media , following the Ethereum (ETH) and BNB. Currently, the Pi Network account is just 300,000 followers behind the Dogecoin (DOGE) account. To celebrate the moment, the official Pi Network team posted on X: “Pi Network now has over 4 million followers on X! Congratulations to everyone in the Pi community for supporting Pi and making this possible.” Pi Network rises in rankings as community pushes for Binance listing Like any other asset growing with the rise of X followers, Pi Network trust is one of the many indicators. The app has similarly reached impressive milestones on the Google Play Store, including more than 113.2 million downloads. For the last month, the Network has seen an average of 270,000 new downloads every day. Apart from social media and app downloads, Pi Network also treats success beyond its ecosystem in the wider crypto space. Of late, it recently placed among CoinGecko’s top five “Made in USA Coins,” even outperforming popular altcoins like Chainlink (LINK), Hedera (HBAR), and Stellar (XLM). Its immediate success was recently displayed as it entered CoinMarketCap’s top rankings, proving more than its footing in the industry. However, despite this success, one of the greatest hurdles yet to overcome is the lack of a Pi Coin (PI) listing on Binance, one of the largest exchanges in the world. A Binance community vote showed that 86% of participants supported an official PI listing. So far, Binance has not acted, making Pi fans increasingly impatient. One pioneer stepped up on X to galvanize support, pledging , “We call on the crypto community to unite! Demand that Binance officially announce the listing of Pi Network.” With growing impatience, Pi Network co-founder Chengdiao Fan urged the community to stay focused, requesting that they focus on what matters and what makes a difference in the crypto space. Fan told Pi supporters to keep building and innovating and to believe that market acceptance will eventually come. Pi Network gains momentum as exchange listings and market interest drive growth For some time, Pi Network has been encumbered by AML (anti-money laundering) concerns and regulatory barriers. The mainstream embrace of trading was limited to rope trading in P2P and OTC markets. However, recent changes to U.S. regulatory policy under the Trump administration increased interest in the Network, with potential listings on major exchanges, including Bitget. This week, Pi Coin made the most important announcement on Tuesday that it had secured a listing through CoinMarketCap. As a result, Pi Coin rose 3% to above $1.74, with a $12.1 billion market cap at press time. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

This article will cover the developments and updates of Arctic Pablo Coin, Brett, and TST. Earn Big with Arctic Pablo Coin’s 66% APY Presale Staking Staking is a game-changer, and Arctic Pablo Coin is proving just that! During its presale phase, investors can stake APC tokens and earn an incredible 66% APY. While most meme coins rely solely on hype, Arctic Pablo Coin is offering real value and tangible rewards.

This bold move makes Arctic Pablo Coin steal the spotlight as the best meme coin to buy today! Arctic Pablo Coin’s ChillVille Presale Surge – Unmissable Opportunity The meme coin presale entered into ChillVille, and so is an unparalleled investment opportunity! Arctic Pablo Coin has entered its 13th presale phase, marking an exciting milestone. Currently priced at just $0.00007 per APC, this is one of the lowest entry points before the launch. With an anticipated listing price of $0.008, investors could see an ROI of over 11,285.71%! With over $1.77 million already raised, the hype is real. As Arctic Pablo Coin advances through its roadmap, prices are set to increase with each phase. The question isn’t if APC will skyrocket—it’s how soon.

Should the coin hit that projected $0.10 mark upon listing, your stake could soar to $57,125.08—an eye-catching return! APC’s rising hype and unique positioning in the crypto space fuel this optimism, making it a tempting opportunity for bold investors. Yet, the crypto market’s volatility calls for caution. Is APC the next big thing, or a speculative gamble? Experts lean bullish, but due diligence is essential before jumping into this chilly coin’s promising waters.

As utility and adoption grow, TST’s future remains promising, with analysts predicting further gains in the coming months.

A judge in the District Court of Northern California delivered a final ruling in the foundation’s legal conflict with Mark Shin, who exploited the bug. “Code is not de-facto law,” Icon concluded. The case was brought by Shin in 2021 after Icon froze his accounts and seized his assets. Before that, Shin had taken advantage of a bug 557 times to generate tokens improperly and increase the token supply by 2.5%. The token subsequently lost 40% of its value. The bug doubled staking withdrawals A software update implemented in August 2020 allowed holders of certain wallets (less than 0.05% of them) to generate an equal number of ICX to the amount the holder removes from staking. Shin used that bug 557 times. The attack, its detection and its solution took place in 11 hours. Shin was not the only user to exploit the bug, but he generated the majority of the erroneous tokens. The Icon Foundation offered Shin a $200,000 bug bounty for the return of the bug-generated tokens, but he rejected the offer. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations seized some of the tokens Shin had transferred from his Icon wallets to cryptocurrency exchanges. A grand jury in Colorado, where Shin is a resident, indicted him for his actions, but his trial resulted in a hung jury, and the Colorado attorney general declined to retry him. Shin could have faced eight to 24 years each on the two felony theft charges and four to 12 years for felony money laundering. Shin wanted the rest of his bug-generated tokens Shin filed suit against Icon in October 2020 seeking the return of the ICX tokens frozen in his Icon wallets. Icon claimed Shin’s actions were unjust enrichment. The sides requested summary judgment in the case in June 2024, and Judge William Orrick dismissed Shin’s claims with prejudice, meaning Shin could not refile the case. In his final ruling on March 3, Orrick ruled that Shin was responsible for Icon’s legal fees of at least $3.5 million and ordered all remaining seized assets converted back to ICX and destroyed. Shin had transferred around 2.1 million of the bug-generated tokens, using the Tornado Cash crypto mixer for some or all of them. Burning the bug-generated tokens will have a deflationary effect on ICX, thus protecting its value. According to an X post reposted by the Icon community, the tokens up for burning are worth around $8 million. “This ruling sets an important precedent for decentralized networks, that code is not de-facto law, and entities have the ability to protect their operations against exploits,” Icon stated in its blog. The blog also quotes at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips Partner Christopher Wanger, who said, “The court’s order confirms that the world of digital assets is not the wild, wild west, code is not law and basic equitable principles apply to cryptocurrency.” Icon was founded in 2017. It is a layer-1 blockchain that hosts apps that can be easily used cross-chain. According to Coingecko , ICX has a total supply of 1.06 million and a market cap of $117.20 million. It’s 24-hour trading volume at the time of writing was $1.65 million and ICX was trading for $0.114 and falling.

BTC fell from $90,251 to $85,091 in less than an hour after Trump signed the order, which establishes a national Bitcoin and crypto stockpile by holding digital assets seized from criminal activities rather than auctioning them off as had been previous practice. BTC has since recovered to $87,202 at time of publishing. The move had been widely anticipated and confirmed the executive action will not actively push the US to purchase crypto assets. White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar David Sacks released a statement on the signing. “Just a few minutes ago, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime. It is estimated that the U.S. government owns about 200,000 bitcoin; however, there has never been a complete audit. The E.O. directs a full accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings. The U.S. will not sell any bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called “digital gold.” Premature sales of bitcoin have already cost U.S. taxpayers over $17 billion in lost value. Now the federal government will have a strategy to maximize the value of its holdings. The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers. IN ADDITION, the Executive Order establishes a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, consisting of digital assets other than bitcoin forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings. The government will not acquire additional assets for the Stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings. The purpose of the Stockpile is responsible stewardship of the government’s digital assets under the Treasury Department. PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT President Trump promised to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile. Those promises have been kept. This Executive Order underscores President Trump’s commitment to making the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world.” I want to thank the President for his leadership and vision in supporting this cutting-edge technology and for his rapid execution in supporting the digital asset industry. His administration is truly moving at ‘tech speed.’ I also want to thank the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets — especially Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick — for their help and support in getting this done. Finally Bo Hines played a critical role as Executive Director of our Working Group.” Bitcoin’s price move has partially retraced a major jump triggered in large part by Trump’s pro-crypto stance. After Trump first announced the strategic Bitcoin reserve during his campaign and won the election on November 5th, BTC surged from around $65,000 to a peak of $108,268 on December 17th.

41258757,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137712,1741310746,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Analysis: Macroeconomic Uncertainty Triggers Risk Aversion in Cryptocurrency Market,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/macroeconomic-uncertainty-risk-aversion-crypto/,"Are you feeling a sense of unease in the cryptocurrency market lately? You’re not alone. The global economic landscape is becoming increasingly uncertain, and this is having a direct impact on digital assets. Let’s dive into a recent analysis that sheds light on why we’re seeing increased risk aversion and what it could mean for the future of crypto. Decoding Macroeconomic Uncertainty: What’s Driving the Fear? According to cryptocurrency analyst Noelle Acheson, the current climate of macroeconomic uncertainty is the primary driver behind the growing risk aversion in the markets. But what exactly does “macroeconomic uncertainty” entail? It’s essentially a broad term that encompasses various factors creating instability and unpredictability in the global economy. These factors include: Inflationary Pressures: Persistent high inflation across major economies is forcing central banks to take aggressive measures, like raising interest rates, to combat it. This creates uncertainty about future economic growth. Interest Rate Hikes: As central banks aggressively hike interest rates to tame inflation, borrowing costs increase for businesses and consumers. This can slow down economic activity and increase the likelihood of a recession. Geopolitical Instability: Ongoing geopolitical tensions and conflicts add another layer of uncertainty, disrupting supply chains and impacting global markets. Recessionary Signals: Economic indicators in major economies, like the U.S., are flashing warning signs, suggesting a potential recession . This combination of factors creates a perfect storm of uncertainty, leading investors to become more cautious and risk-averse. They tend to move away from assets perceived as risky, like cryptocurrencies, towards safer havens. Risk Aversion Takes Center Stage: How Does it Impact Crypto? When risk aversion spikes, investors typically reduce their exposure to volatile assets. Cryptocurrencies, known for their price swings, are often among the first to feel the heat. Acheson highlights this in her analysis, suggesting that the cryptocurrency market is likely to face downward pressure in the short term due to this increased risk-off sentiment. Think of it like this: imagine you’re navigating a stormy sea. In calm waters, you might be adventurous and explore uncharted territories (risky assets). But as the storm intensifies (economic uncertainty), your priority shifts to seeking safe harbor and securing your belongings (safe assets). This “flight to safety” is precisely what we’re observing in the markets right now. The Inverted Yield Curve: A Recessionary Alarm Bell? Acheson points to a critical economic indicator: the inverted yield curve . The yield curve represents the difference in yields between bonds of different maturities. Normally, longer-term bonds have higher yields than shorter-term bonds. However, when short-term bond yields rise above long-term bond yields, the yield curve inverts. Historically, an inverted yield curve has been a reliable predictor of economic recessions. Acheson notes that the spread between the U.S. 10-year and 3-month Treasury bonds has turned negative again, signaling a renewed inversion. This inversion reinforces concerns about a potential recession in the U.S. economy, further fueling risk aversion. Let’s break down why an inverted yield curve is considered a recessionary indicator: Indicator Normal Yield Curve Inverted Yield Curve Long-term bond yields Higher Lower Short-term bond yields Lower Higher Economic Outlook Positive/Stable Negative/Recessionary Investor Sentiment Optimistic Pessimistic The inversion suggests that investors anticipate lower interest rates in the future, typically a response to expected economic slowdown or recession. This anticipation itself can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, as businesses and consumers become more cautious in their spending and investment decisions. Is Bitcoin a Safe Haven Amidst Economic Storms? Interestingly, amidst all the gloom, Acheson highlights a contrasting narrative: the “safe haven” appeal of Bitcoin is gaining traction. While macroeconomic uncertainty and risk aversion typically push investors away from crypto, Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed by some as a store of value, a hedge against inflation, and a safe haven asset, similar to gold. This narrative is fueled, in part, by positive news and pronouncements, potentially from institutions or governments, that could boost confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. However, it’s crucial to remember that the “safe haven” narrative for Bitcoin is still evolving and is not universally accepted. Bitcoin’s price volatility remains significant, and it’s still subject to market fluctuations driven by broader economic trends and investor sentiment. Navigating the Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts So, what does all this mean for you as a crypto investor or enthusiast? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on macroeconomic indicators, central bank policies, and geopolitical developments. These factors will significantly influence the cryptocurrency market in the coming months. Manage Risk: In times of heightened risk aversion , it’s prudent to manage your portfolio risk. Consider diversifying your holdings and adjusting your asset allocation to align with your risk tolerance. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that market cycles are a natural part of investing. While short-term pressures may exist, maintain a long-term perspective on the potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Due Diligence: Continue to do your research on specific crypto projects and understand their fundamentals. Focus on projects with strong use cases, solid teams, and robust technology. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): In volatile markets, DCA can be a strategy to mitigate risk. Instead of investing a lump sum, consider investing smaller amounts at regular intervals. Conclusion: Weathering the Storm with Knowledge and Prudence The current macroeconomic uncertainty is undoubtedly creating headwinds for the cryptocurrency market . Increased risk aversion , fueled by factors like inflation, interest rate hikes, and recession fears indicated by the inverted yield curve , is likely to put pressure on crypto prices in the short term. However, the evolving narrative of Bitcoin as a potential safe haven offers a glimmer of hope and highlights the complex and dynamic nature of the crypto landscape. Navigating these uncertain times requires a balanced approach – staying informed, managing risk prudently, and maintaining a long-term perspective. By understanding the macroeconomic forces at play and their potential impact on the crypto market, you can make more informed decisions and weather the storm with greater confidence.

This week, ai16z is struggling, down 20% in the last seven days, with trading volume sliding by 11.65%. On the other hand, Snek (SNEK) is making waves, jumping 20.17% over the same period, showing impressive resilience on the Cardano blockchain. But the biggest buzz in the market is around BTFD Coin, where investors are pouring in ahead of a major presale milestone. With over $6.26 million raised, a 100% bonus code still active, and a referral program rewarding the top players, BTFD is shaping up to be the next crypto to explode . BTFD Coin’s Referral Program Sparks FOMO Meme coins aren’t just about hype anymore— BTFD Coin is leading a movement. The project has not only built a loyal Bulls Squad but also introduced a referral program that’s turning heads. The concept is simple: share your referral code, and if someone buys BTFD with it, they get an extra 10% in tokens—and if you’re in the top 20 referrers, you get 10% of the total raise in BTFD at the end of the month. The presale is moving fast, with Stage 14 priced at just $0.00016 per token. That means investors can still grab BTFD at a steep discount before it lists at $0.0006. And with a projected moon price of $0.006, the potential returns are staggering. For example, an $8,000 investment in Stage 14 would secure 50 million BTFD tokens. At the listing price of $0.0006, that would be worth $30,000. But if BTFD reaches its projected $0.006 moon price, that same investment would skyrocket to $300,000, making it clear why investors are treating BTFD Coin as the next crypto to explode. With over 71 billion BTFD tokens sold and 11,200 investors already on board, the Bulls Squad is growing fast. The 100% bonus code (LAUNCH100) won’t last forever, making this the last chance to double your tokens before the presale moves into its final stages. ai16z Faces Headwinds Amid Market Volatility While AI-driven cryptos were all the rage just a few months ago, some are now struggling to maintain momentum. ai16z, the venture capital AI project, has been slipping, down 20% in a week, with trading volume dropping by 11.65%. Investors seem to be reconsidering their positions, causing a sell-off that’s put pressure on the price. The idea behind ai16z is groundbreaking—a crypto fund managed by AI with the goal of shaping Web3 investments. However, the market response has been mixed, and recent trading activity suggests that some investors are cashing out as uncertainty looms. That said, AI tokens have proven to be resilient in the past, and ai16z could see a turnaround if market sentiment shifts. Snek Continues to Gain Momentum on Cardano While some projects are experiencing market turbulence, Snek (SNEK) is enjoying an impressive rally. Over the last seven days, Snek’s price has jumped 20.17%, solidifying its position as Cardano’s leading memecoin. Despite a 2.06% decline in the last 24 hours, Snek’s long-term outlook remains strong, with consistent trading volume and a rapidly growing community. Unlike Ethereum-based meme coins, Snek benefits from the efficiency of the Cardano blockchain, which offers lower transaction fees and a more scalable infrastructure. This has helped Snek attract both meme coin traders and Cardano enthusiasts, creating a strong base of support. With Cardano adoption rising, many see Snek as a long-term contender in the meme coin space. As the most traded token on Cardano, its momentum isn’t slowing down anytime soon.

Meet Mistral AI, a French startup that is not just turning heads but is being openly championed as Europe’s best hope to challenge the dominance of OpenAI. With a valuation soaring to billions and a suite of innovative AI models , Mistral AI is making waves. But is it truly poised to become a significant OpenAI competitor , and what makes it so special? Let’s dive into everything you need to know about this fascinating company. What Exactly is Mistral AI? Born in 2023, Mistral AI quickly positioned itself with a bold ambition: to “put frontier AI in the hands of everyone.” This isn’t just a catchy slogan; it reflects the company’s core philosophy of promoting openness and accessibility in the AI space. While not explicitly targeting OpenAI, this mission statement subtly highlights a different approach compared to some of its competitors. Mistral AI aims to democratize advanced AI technology. The company’s commitment to this vision is evident in its product offerings, most notably Le Chat , Mistral AI’s answer to ChatGPT. This AI assistant is now readily available on both iOS and Android platforms, marking a significant step in making advanced AI tools more accessible to everyday users. The initial reception has been enthusiastic, with Le Chat achieving one million downloads within two weeks of its mobile launch and even topping the free download charts in France’s iOS App Store. This surge in popularity was further boosted by endorsements from high-profile figures, including French President Emmanuel Macron, who publicly encouraged citizens to choose Le Chat over alternatives like ChatGPT. Beyond Le Chat, Mistral AI has developed a comprehensive suite of AI models , each designed for specific applications and needs. These include: Mistral Large 2 : Their flagship large language model, designed to succeed the original Mistral Large, aiming for top-tier performance in complex AI tasks. Pixtral Large : A multimodal model introduced in 2024, expanding the Pixtral family and capable of processing various types of data beyond just text. Codestral : A generative AI model specifically tailored for code generation, assisting developers in writing and understanding code more efficiently. “Les Ministraux” : A family of models optimized for edge computing, designed to run efficiently on devices with limited resources, like smartphones. Mistral Saba : A model with a focus on Arabic language processing, showcasing Mistral AI’s commitment to linguistic diversity and global accessibility. Mistral OCR : Introduced in March 2025, this Optical Character Recognition API converts PDFs into text, streamlining data ingestion for AI models. Who are the Masterminds Behind Mistral AI? The foundation of Mistral AI rests on the shoulders of three founders, each bringing a wealth of experience from leading AI research labs at major U.S. tech giants with significant operations in Paris. This concentration of talent in France is a key factor in why Mistral AI is considered a jewel in the crown of European AI innovation. Arthur Mensch (CEO) : Formerly with Google’s DeepMind, Mensch brings leadership and a deep understanding of advanced AI research and development. Timothée Lacroix (CTO) : A former Meta staffer, Lacroix’s technical expertise is crucial in driving Mistral AI’s technological advancements and infrastructure. Guillaume Lample (Chief Scientist Officer) : Also from Meta, Lample’s role as Chief Scientist Officer underscores the company’s commitment to cutting-edge research and scientific rigor in AI development. Adding to this impressive lineup, Mistral AI’s co-founding advisors include Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve and Charles Gorintin from Alan, and Cédric O, a former digital minister. This blend of tech expertise and business acumen, alongside political connections, positions Mistral AI uniquely within the European tech landscape. Open Source or Proprietary: Decoding Mistral AI’s Model Strategy A key differentiator for Mistral AI lies in its approach to open source. Unlike some competitors who keep their most advanced models strictly proprietary, Mistral AI adopts a nuanced strategy, differentiating between its premier models and its free offerings. This strategy is crucial in understanding how Mistral AI positions itself in the competitive AI models market. While Mistral AI’s top-tier models are not open source for commercial use, the company actively supports the open-source community by providing access to the weights of certain research models under the Apache 2.0 license. A prime example is Mistral NeMo, a research model developed in collaboration with Nvidia, which was open-sourced in July 2024. This commitment to open source fosters innovation and collaboration within the AI community, aligning with their mission to democratize AI. How Does Mistral AI Generate Revenue? While many of Mistral AI’s offerings are free or have free tiers, the company has a clear monetization strategy to support its ambitious growth and research. Revenue generation is essential for Mistral AI to compete effectively as an OpenAI competitor and sustain its operations. Mistral AI’s revenue streams include: Le Chat Pro Subscription : Introduced in February 2025, Le Chat’s Pro plan is priced at $14.99 per month, offering users enhanced features and capabilities for a premium experience. API Access to Premier Models : On the B2B front, Mistral AI monetizes its advanced models through APIs with usage-based pricing, catering to businesses needing powerful AI solutions. Enterprise Licensing : Companies can license Mistral AI’s premier models for integration into their own systems and applications, providing a significant revenue stream. Strategic Partnerships : Collaborations with major industry players are likely a substantial source of revenue, as highlighted during the Paris AI Summit. Despite these diverse revenue streams, reports indicate that Mistral AI’s revenue is still in the eight-digit range. Scaling revenue to match its multi-billion dollar valuation remains a key challenge for the company. Strategic Alliances: Mistral AI’s Key Partnerships Strategic partnerships are crucial for any tech startup aiming for rapid growth and market penetration. Mistral AI has been proactive in forging alliances to expand its reach and capabilities in the competitive European AI landscape. Key partnerships include: Microsoft : In 2024, Mistral AI struck a deal with Microsoft, encompassing a strategic partnership to distribute its AI models via Microsoft Azure and a €15 million investment. While the deal was cleared by the UK’s CMA without investigation, it did raise some eyebrows in the EU regarding potential concentration of power. Agence France-Presse (AFP) : A January 2025 agreement allows Le Chat to query AFP’s extensive text archive dating back to 1983, enhancing its information retrieval capabilities. French Government & Industry : Strategic partnerships with the French army, job agency, German defense tech startup Helsing, IBM, Orange, and Stellantis underscore Mistral AI’s deep integration within the European industrial and governmental ecosystem. Funding Milestones: Fueling Mistral AI’s Ascent Securing substantial funding is a testament to investor confidence and a critical enabler for growth in the capital-intensive AI industry. Mistral AI has demonstrated remarkable fundraising success in its short history, solidifying its position as a leading European AI startup. As of February 2025, Mistral AI had raised approximately €1 billion, or $1.04 billion, through a mix of debt and equity financing rounds. Key funding rounds include: Seed Round (June 2023) : A record-breaking $112 million seed round, Europe’s largest ever, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, valuing the one-month-old startup at $260 million. Series A (Six months later) : €385 million ($415 million) led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), valuing the company at $2 billion. Series A Extension (February 2024) : Microsoft’s $16.3 million convertible investment, maintaining the Series A valuation. €600 million Round (June 2024) : Led by General Catalyst at a $6 billion valuation, with participation from major tech players like Cisco, IBM, Nvidia, and Samsung. This rapid accumulation of capital reflects strong investor belief in Mistral AI’s potential to disrupt the AI landscape and emerge as a significant OpenAI competitor . Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Mistral AI? The question on everyone’s mind is: what does the future hold for Mistral AI? While acquisition rumors constantly swirl, Mistral AI’s leadership, particularly CEO Arthur Mensch, has firmly stated that the company is “not for sale” and is aiming for an IPO. This ambition is understandable given the significant capital raised and the desire to maintain independence, especially in the strategically important field of AI. However, achieving an IPO and justifying its near-$6 billion valuation requires substantial revenue growth. Scaling its revenue streams, particularly through its B2B offerings and Le Chat subscriptions, will be crucial in the coming years. The path to becoming a truly dominant OpenAI competitor is challenging, but Mistral AI’s rapid progress, strategic partnerships, and strong financial backing position it as a formidable player in the global AI arena. For now, all eyes are on Mistral AI as it navigates the complexities of the AI market, striving to balance its open-source ethos with commercial imperatives and the ambition to be a leading force in the next wave of AI innovation. The journey of this European AI champion is just beginning, and the world is watching closely.

Is this a sign of big moves to come? Let’s dive into what this surge in Bitcoin open interest means and what implications it holds for the market and the upcoming summit. Decoding the Surge: What is Bitcoin Open Interest? For those new to crypto derivatives, Bitcoin open interest (OI) represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures and options, that are yet to be settled. In simpler terms, it’s the total amount of money flowing into these contracts. A rising OI generally indicates increased participation and speculation in the market. Think of it as a barometer of market activity and trader engagement. Several factors can influence Bitcoin open interest , including: Market Sentiment: Positive market sentiment often leads to increased OI as traders anticipate price appreciation. Price Action: Significant price movements can attract more traders, boosting OI. Upcoming Events: Events like the White House Crypto Summit can create anticipation and drive trading activity, influencing OI. Institutional Interest: Increased institutional participation in crypto derivatives can significantly impact OI. Currently, the rising Bitcoin open interest suggests a growing anticipation among market participants. According to a report by The Block, this surge is occurring in the lead-up to the White House Crypto Summit scheduled for March 8th. This timing is no coincidence, as many believe the summit could introduce new regulatory frameworks or policy updates that will significantly impact the cryptocurrency landscape. White House Crypto Summit: A Catalyst for Market Movement? The White House Crypto Summit is generating considerable buzz within the crypto community. Why? Because it’s expected to bring together key industry players, policymakers, and regulators to discuss the future of digital assets in the United States. The potential outcomes of this summit are vast, ranging from clearer regulatory guidelines to potential endorsements of certain crypto technologies. Here’s why the summit is so crucial and how it ties into the rising crypto market analysis : Regulatory Clarity: The biggest hope is for clearer regulations. Ambiguity around crypto regulations has been a persistent concern, hindering institutional adoption and market growth. The summit could provide much-needed direction. Policy Direction: The summit might reveal the White House’s stance on crypto innovation, potentially fostering a more supportive environment for the industry. Market Confidence: Positive outcomes from the summit could inject confidence into the crypto market analysis , attracting more investors and driving up prices. Innovation and Growth: Supportive policies could encourage innovation and growth within the crypto and blockchain sectors in the US. Gordon Grant, a seasoned cryptocurrency derivatives trader, notes the increasing buying pressure since Bitcoin tested $82,000. This, coupled with the rising Bitcoin open interest and funding rates, paints a picture of a market bracing for potential positive news. But what exactly are funding rates, and how do they fit into this puzzle? Funding Rates and Market Sentiment: A Deeper Dive into Crypto Market Analysis Funding rates in perpetual futures markets offer another layer of insight into market sentiment. These rates are periodic payments exchanged between buyers and sellers based on the difference between the perpetual contract price and the spot price. Here’s a simplified breakdown: Funding Rate Market Sentiment Implication Positive Bullish Long positions pay short positions. Indicates more traders are bullish and willing to pay to hold long positions. Negative Bearish Short positions pay long positions. Indicates more traders are bearish and willing to pay to hold short positions. Julio Moreno, a senior analyst at CryptoQuant, highlights the recovery in funding rates across the perpetual futures market. This recovery, according to Moreno, could stem from market participants’ heightened expectations surrounding the Crypto Summit. In essence, the rising funding rates, alongside the surging Bitcoin open interest , suggest a growing bullish sentiment as traders position themselves to capitalize on potential positive announcements from the summit. Bitcoin Futures and Raised Expectations: What Does It All Mean? The futures market plays a significant role in price discovery and speculation within the cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin futures contracts allow traders to bet on the future price of Bitcoin without actually owning the underlying asset. The increasing activity in Bitcoin futures , reflected in the rising open interest and funding rates, points towards a market anticipating significant movement. Market participants are seemingly raising their expectations, betting that the White House Crypto Summit will be a positive catalyst for the industry. This anticipation is fueling the demand for Bitcoin futures contracts, driving up open interest and pushing funding rates into positive territory. It’s a classic case of “buy the rumor, sell the news” potentially unfolding, but with a regulatory twist. However, it’s crucial to remember that markets are inherently unpredictable. While the current indicators suggest bullish sentiment, the actual outcome of the White House Crypto Summit and its impact on the crypto market analysis remain uncertain. It’s possible that the summit might not deliver the hoped-for clarity or positive policies, leading to market disappointment and potential price corrections. Navigating the Crypto Market: Actionable Insights for Investors So, what should crypto investors and enthusiasts make of this situation? Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news and developments surrounding the White House Crypto Summit. Real-time updates can provide valuable clues about market direction. Manage Risk: While bullish sentiment is growing, exercise caution. Market expectations are high, and there’s always a risk of disappointment. Implement prudent risk management strategies. Analyze Market Indicators: Pay attention to Bitcoin open interest , funding rates, and other market indicators to gauge market sentiment and potential shifts. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification can help mitigate risks in the volatile crypto market. Prepare for Volatility: Events like the White House Crypto Summit can trigger significant market volatility. Be prepared for potential price swings. Conclusion: A Market on Edge – Hopeful or Hype? The surging Bitcoin open interest ahead of the White House Crypto Summit paints a compelling picture of a market brimming with anticipation. The rising OI and positive funding rates suggest a growing bullish sentiment, fueled by hopes for positive regulatory outcomes and policy clarity from the summit. However, it’s vital to approach this situation with a balanced perspective. While the indicators are intriguing, the crypto market remains susceptible to volatility and unexpected turns. Whether this surge is driven by genuine hope or speculative hype will become clearer as we approach and navigate the White House Crypto Summit. One thing is certain: the crypto world is watching with bated breath.

41259923,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=687778,1741312800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41259923.jpeg,"Forget XRP and Cardano, This Is the Best Altcoin to Buy as Trump Announces a U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/forget-xrp-and-cardano-this-is-the-best-altcoin-to-buy-as-trump-announces-a-u-s-strategic-crypto-reserve/,"Donald Trump recently declared a U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve that includes Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP and Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) as part of the portfolio. Even though the assets benefit from positive market conditions their considerable market size poses obstacles to significant price increases. Significant growth of XRP to Cardano values exceeding ten times their current prices needs massive capital injections that seem improbable. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has recently become a popular project because it continues advancing through the second phase of its presale. The presale funding exceeded $2.2 million while the number of holders reached 4200. Investors now have the chance to buy MUTM tokens at $0.015 because they will increase by 33.33% soon to reach $0.02 during the subsequent stage. Phase 2 investors will benefit from a 300% return on investment because the launch price is established at $0.06. Mutuum Finance allows investors to seize significant returns amounting to 100 times more than what major coins offer because it will launch at $0.06. The crypto initiative from Trump does not enjoy universal support from his base of followers. Bitcoin stands alone as the proper base according to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong for any strategic reserve foundation. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss express their doubts about integrating riskier smaller assets into the initiative because they fear it will weaken its reputation. New investors seeking high-growth potential are focusing on relatively low-capped entries like MUTM as they believe these markets can experience tremendous expansion. XRP and Cardano Stand to Gain, But Are They Too Big to Boom? The announcement of U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve by Donald Trump brought positive momentum to XRP and Cardano (ADA) thus affirming their importance in the crypto industry. The two blockchain platforms XRP and Crdano will gain substantial benefits from the rising institutional attention in the market. The limited potential for significant market gains exists because XRP maintains a market value surpassing $30 billion while ADA stays at $20 billion. The extreme capital influx demanded for a 10x price surge would be virtually impossible for these established projects because their current market caps are extensively larger than less well-known newcomers. Mutuum Finance leads the development of decentralized finance Decentralized finance platform Mutuum Finance has secured widespread popularity because its initial funding during the pre-sale phase exceeded $2.2 million and accumulated more than 4,200 participants. Mutuum Finance starts its Phase 2 at $0.015 and plans to raise its price to $0.06 upon launch which presents potential gains of 300% before accessing major exchanges. The Defi sector recognizes Mutuum Finance as one of the leading investment opportunities because of its rising market position and expanding user base. The advanced lending protocol of Mutuum Finance joins Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Peer-to-Contract (P2C) models to provide its users with two-tiered borrowing services.

So far, BTC has reclaimed the $90,000 level amid renewed market activity. The cryptocurrency surged nearly 10% yesterday, briefly reaching a high of $92,756 in the early hours of today before experiencing a minor pullback. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $90,156, marking a 0.6% decrease over the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Short-Term Holders Dominate as Bitcoin Rebounds—What’s Next? Short-Term Holder Trends and Potential Market Consolidation Yonsei Dent, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, pointed out earlier today a tightening trend in short-term holder (STH) realized price levels, suggesting a potential shift in market conditions. The analyst noted that this development, alongside key moving averages, could indicate a period of market consolidation unless a strong demand catalyst emerges. According to Yonsei Dent, the convergence of Short-Term Holder Realized Price levels suggests that the average entry price of recent Bitcoin buyers is becoming more uniform. Historically, such conditions have signaled either reduced volatility or a lack of clear price direction, leading to a phase of consolidation. Additionally, Dent noted that the 60-day and 200-day moving averages are also tightening, mirroring a similar trend observed in May 2024, which resulted in a period of low volatility and minimal price movement. A major factor influencing Bitcoin’s market outlook is regulatory developments, particularly the Trump administration’s stance on cryptocurrency policies. Dent highlighted that the upcoming cryptocurrency summit, scheduled for tomorrow, could introduce key regulatory discussions that may influence Bitcoin’s price action. The CryptoQuant analyst wrote: All eyes are on tomorrow’s cryptocurrency summit, where key regulatory discussions are expected. Should a bullish policy outlook emerge, it could inject fresh momentum into the market and break this tightening price structure.

Crypto specialist Ali has noted that SOL is currently valued at $141.25 and anticipates a price surge of 13% shortly. This pattern indicates that Solana is at a pivotal consolidation point, with traders poised for a breakout that could push prices notably higher. Meanwhile, a less-known altcoin, Web3Bay (3BAY) , is gaining traction during its presale, with experts forecasting a staggering 3,633% increase in its value at launch. With the presale already raising over $1.6 million, Web3Bay is emerging as one of the most promising crypto ventures of 2025, potentially eclipsing the gains expected from Solana. Is Solana’s 13% Surge on the Horizon? Currently, Solana is consolidating, displaying a symmetrical triangle pattern, a typical precursor to a significant market move. The price initially saw a steep decline, followed by a 12.54% fall, setting the lower edge of the triangle. Nonetheless, Solana quickly recovered, marking higher lows and lower highs, indicating a fierce battle between buyers and sellers. Market watchers are keeping a close eye on critical resistance and support levels. Should Solana breach the resistance trendline, it might experience a robust upward movement of about 13%. On the other hand, a move below could signal further declines, making the upcoming trading sessions vital for determining SOL’s near-term trajectory. With a generally bullish market sentiment and growing institutional interest in Solana, many are optimistic about SOL’s next significant price movement being upward. Despite this positive outlook for Solana, the buzz is increasingly shifting towards Web3Bay, a new crypto initiative that promises even more substantial returns. Web3Bay’s 3,633% Potential Surge—The Investment Gem Catching Buyers’ Eyes Now While Solana’s anticipated 13% rise is enticing for short-term traders, Web3Bay offers a far greater opportunity for explosive growth. This project is transforming e-commerce by developing a decentralized marketplace that cuts out middlemen, slashes fees, and boosts security for users. Unlike conventional platforms like Amazon and eBay, Web3Bay enables direct peer-to-peer transactions, putting control entirely in the hands of its users. Already, Web3Bay’s presale has amassed over $1.6 million, signaling strong investor trust in its future. Priced at only $0.00524 currently, early investors are seizing the chance to buy in at the bottom, with an expected launch price of $0.1959. This sets the stage for a potential 3,633% return on investment, positioning it as one of the top crypto opportunities of 2025. What sets Web3Bay apart is its practical use in the trillion-dollar e-commerce sector. Traditional marketplaces often have high fees, strict rules, and privacy concerns, centralizing benefits away from buyers and sellers. Web3Bay disrupts this by facilitating direct commerce, utilizing blockchain to ensure secure, transparent transactions without intermediaries. With the increasing demand for decentralized solutions across various sectors, Web3Bay’s pioneering role in e-commerce marks it as a key player for sustained growth. Its utility-driven approach distinguishes it from speculative tokens, attracting serious consideration from both retail and institutional investors. Final Say Both Solana and Web3Bay are poised for substantial growth, yet they appeal to distinct investor strategies. Solana is a well-established cryptocurrency expected to see a 13% increase, offering reliable short-term gains. However, its large market capitalization limits the potential for transformative returns. While Solana’s expected technical surge is noteworthy, those seeking more significant growth are turning to smaller, nascent projects like Web3Bay. Web3Bay stands out with its untapped price potential and a forecasted 3,633% ROI, offering a profit opportunity that large-cap cryptos like Solana cannot match. For those who missed the initial rise of Solana, now is the chance to get in early on a promising project like Web3Bay. It offers not just immediate gains but also the prospect of enduring success as it continues to resonate within the e-commerce space. With Web3Bay’s presale ongoing and Solana’s breakout on the horizon, the choice is clear—opt for steady gains with a veteran crypto, or embrace the substantial growth potential of an up-and-coming contender.

Despite facing fierce opposition and an open letter signed by nearly 6,500 artists demanding its cancellation, the ‘Augmented Intelligence’ auction not only proceeded but spectacularly exceeded all expectations. Let’s dive into this groundbreaking event and explore what it signifies for the burgeoning intersection of AI in art and the established art market. Spectacular Success of the AI Art Auction: By the Numbers Against a backdrop of controversy, the Christie’s auction of AI art proved to be a resounding financial success. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key highlights: Total Sales: The auction raked in over $700,000, demonstrating a significant collector interest in this novel art form. High Estimates Surpassed: Many lots sold for prices exceeding their initial high estimates, indicating strong bidding and competitive demand. Top Lot: Anadol’s ‘Machine Hallucinations — ISS Dreams — A,’ a mesmerizing dynamic painting interpreting data from the International Space Station, stole the show, fetching a staggering $277,200. Nicole Sales Giles, VP and director of digital art sales at Christie’s, emphasized to Artnet that the auction’s success unequivocally ‘confirmed’ the art world’s recognition of ‘creative voices pushing the boundaries of art.’ This bold statement underscores Christie’s confidence in the future of digital art sales and AI’s role within it. Why the Controversy? Artists’ Concerns Regarding AI Art The success of the AI art auction is even more noteworthy considering the intense pre-auction backlash. Thousands of artists voiced their strong disapproval, primarily due to concerns surrounding: Copyright Infringement: A central argument in the open letter was that AI models are often trained on copyrighted artwork without proper licensing. Exploitation of Human Artists: Artists argue that using their work without permission to train AI models that then compete with them is exploitative and unethical. Devaluation of Human Creativity: Some fear that the rise of AI art could diminish the value and recognition of art created by human artists. These are valid and critical concerns that warrant serious discussion as AI continues to permeate various creative industries. The art community is grappling with how to navigate these new technological landscapes fairly and ethically. Augmented Intelligence: More Than Just a Buzzword? Christie’s titled the auction ‘ Augmented Intelligence ,’ a term that speaks to the collaborative potential between humans and AI. Is this simply clever marketing, or does it represent a genuine shift in how we perceive creativity? Perhaps it’s both. While the term can be seen as a way to soften the potentially disruptive nature of AI in art, it also highlights the reality that AI tools are increasingly becoming sophisticated instruments for artistic expression. Artists are starting to explore AI not just as a replacement, but as a collaborator, using it to augment their own creative processes and push artistic boundaries in unprecedented ways. The Future of AI in Art and Digital Collectibles: What’s Next? The groundbreaking AI art auction at Christie’s signals a pivotal moment. It’s clear that AI-generated art is gaining traction and market acceptance. What can we expect moving forward? Increased Mainstream Acceptance: As demonstrated by Christie’s foray, major art institutions are starting to acknowledge and validate AI art. This trend is likely to continue, leading to wider acceptance among collectors and the general public. Evolving Legal and Ethical Frameworks: The copyright and ethical concerns raised by artists need to be addressed. We can anticipate ongoing discussions and the development of legal frameworks to govern AI-generated content and protect artists’ rights. New Artistic Mediums and Expressions: AI opens up entirely new avenues for artistic creation. We’re likely to see the emergence of novel art forms and styles that are uniquely enabled by AI, pushing the boundaries of what we consider ‘art.’ Growth in Digital Art Market: The success of this auction further fuels the growth of the digital art market, particularly in the realm of NFTs and blockchain-based art ownership, offering new opportunities for artists and collectors alike. Navigating the AI Art Revolution: Actionable Insights For artists, collectors, and enthusiasts alike, the rise of AI art presents both challenges and opportunities. Here are some actionable insights to consider: For Artists: Embrace AI as a tool for creative exploration. Experiment with AI models to augment your artistic practice and discover new forms of expression. Stay informed about the ethical and legal discussions surrounding AI art and advocate for fair practices. For Collectors: Explore the burgeoning AI art market. Do your research, understand the artists and technologies involved, and consider adding AI-generated pieces to your collection. Be mindful of the provenance and ethical considerations of the art you acquire. For Enthusiasts: Engage in the conversation. Learn about AI art, explore online platforms showcasing AI-generated creations, and contribute to the ongoing dialogue about the future of art in the age of AI. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Art? Christie’s spectacular AI art auction marks a significant milestone in the evolution of art. While the debate surrounding AI’s role in creativity is far from over, the commercial success of this event is undeniable. It signals a shift in the art world, forcing us to reconsider traditional notions of authorship, originality, and artistic value. The future of art is undoubtedly being reshaped by AI, and this auction is a bold declaration of that reality. The conversation has just begun, and the implications are profound for artists, collectors, and the very definition of art itself.

41260387,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137793,1741313721,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Crypto Sanctions: US Secret Service Blocks Garantex Exchange Website,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-secret-service-garantex-blocked/,"In a dramatic escalation of regulatory pressure within the cryptocurrency space, the United States Secret Service (USSS) has reportedly taken decisive action against Garantex, a Russian cryptocurrency exchange already under the weight of U.S. and EU sanctions. This bold move, first reported by TechCrunch, involves the outright blocking of Garantex’s website, signaling a significant intensification in the global crackdown on sanctioned entities operating within the digital asset realm. But what does this Garantex Exchange Blocked mean for the broader crypto landscape, and what are the implications for users and the future of crypto regulation? Why Did the US Secret Service Block Garantex? The US Secret Service ‘s action against Garantex is not an isolated event, but rather a culmination of increasing scrutiny and enforcement targeting cryptocurrency exchanges perceived to be facilitating illicit activities or circumventing international sanctions. Garantex, already facing sanctions from both the U.S. and EU, has been under the microscope for some time. This website block likely stems from concerns that despite sanctions, Garantex continued to operate and potentially enable financial transactions that undermine these restrictions. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors leading to this action: Sanctions Evasion Concerns: Garantex, being a Russian exchange, has been suspected of aiding in the evasion of sanctions imposed on Russia following geopolitical events. Cryptocurrencies, due to their decentralized nature, can be used to bypass traditional financial systems, making exchanges like Garantex potential conduits for sanctioned funds. US and EU Sanctions: Both the United States and the European Union had already imposed sanctions on Garantex. Blocking the website is a further step to enforce these sanctions and limit Garantex’s operational capabilities and reach. Tether’s USDT Freeze: Prior to the website block, USDT issuer Tether froze a substantial $27 million worth of USDT held by Garantex. This action by Tether, a significant player in the stablecoin market, highlights the growing pressure on exchanges to comply with regulatory demands and anti-money laundering (AML) measures. Broader Regulatory Crackdown: Globally, regulatory bodies are intensifying their oversight of the cryptocurrency industry. The action against Garantex can be seen as part of this wider trend, signaling that authorities are serious about enforcing regulations and preventing the use of crypto for illicit purposes. Impact of Crypto Sanctions on Russian Crypto Exchanges The blocking of Garantex’s website and the preceding crypto sanctions have significant implications, particularly for the Russian crypto market and its users. These actions are not just about one exchange; they represent a broader strategy to isolate Russia financially and limit its access to the global financial system, including the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. Consider these crucial points regarding the impact: Reduced Access for Russian Users: Blocking Garantex’s website directly restricts access for Russian users who may have relied on this exchange for cryptocurrency trading and transactions. This limits their options within the regulated crypto space and potentially pushes them towards less regulated or decentralized alternatives. Increased Scrutiny on Other Exchanges: The Garantex situation serves as a stark warning to other cryptocurrency exchanges, particularly those operating in or associated with sanctioned regions. It signals that regulators are willing to take aggressive action, including website blocks, to enforce sanctions. Potential for Decentralized Solutions: While centralized exchanges face increasing regulatory pressure, this could inadvertently drive users towards decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms, which are harder to regulate and control. However, these platforms also come with their own risks, including security vulnerabilities and lack of user protection. Impact on Crypto Adoption in Russia: Stringent regulations and sanctions can stifle the growth of the legitimate cryptocurrency industry within Russia. While some may see crypto as a way to circumvent sanctions, the risks associated with using sanctioned exchanges and facing regulatory repercussions could deter wider adoption. The Tether USDT Freeze: A Turning Point? The fact that Tether, the issuer of USDT, froze $27 million of USDT belonging to Garantex is a particularly noteworthy development. The Tether USDT Freeze highlights the increasing compliance pressure even on stablecoin issuers, who play a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem. USDT is the most widely used stablecoin, and Tether’s actions can have a ripple effect throughout the market. Let’s analyze why this USDT freeze is significant: Aspect Significance of Tether USDT Freeze Centralized Control Demonstrates that even decentralized-seeming cryptocurrencies rely on centralized entities (like Tether) that can exert control and comply with regulatory demands. Compliance Pressure on Stablecoins Sets a precedent for stablecoin issuers to actively monitor and freeze assets associated with sanctioned entities or illicit activities. This increases the operational and compliance burden on stablecoin providers. Impact on Exchange Liquidity Freezing a substantial amount of USDT can significantly impact an exchange’s liquidity and operational capabilities, as USDT is a key trading pair and a store of value within the crypto market. Broader Implications for DeFi While this action is against a centralized exchange, it raises questions about the potential for similar compliance measures to extend into the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, particularly for stablecoins used within DeFi protocols. What’s Next for Garantex and Crypto Regulation? The future for Garantex looks bleak. With its website blocked and significant assets frozen, its operational viability is severely compromised. It had already announced the suspension of all services, including withdrawals, indicating the severity of the situation. This case underscores the escalating regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Key takeaways and actionable insights include: Enhanced Due Diligence: Cryptocurrency exchanges must prioritize robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures to comply with international regulations and avoid becoming targets for enforcement actions. Transparency and Compliance: Operating with transparency and actively engaging with regulatory bodies is crucial for exchanges to build trust and ensure long-term sustainability. User Awareness: Crypto users need to be aware of the risks associated with using exchanges operating in sanctioned regions or those with a history of regulatory issues. Diversifying holdings and using reputable, compliant platforms is advisable. Evolving Regulatory Landscape: The crypto regulatory environment is constantly evolving. Staying informed about regulatory changes and adapting to new requirements is essential for both exchanges and users. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for the Crypto Industry The Garantex Exchange Blocked by the US Secret Service serves as a stark and shocking reminder of the increasing regulatory scrutiny facing the cryptocurrency industry. The combined actions of website blocking, sanctions enforcement, and asset freezes signal a new era of stricter oversight and enforcement. For exchanges, this means a non-negotiable need for compliance and transparency. For users, it emphasizes the importance of choosing regulated platforms and understanding the evolving risks within the crypto space. This incident is not just about Garantex; it’s a critical juncture that will likely shape the future of crypto sanctions and regulation globally, pushing the industry towards greater accountability and compliance.

The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold,’” said Sacks. “Premature sales of bitcoin have already cost U.S. taxpayers over $17 billion in lost value. Now the federal government will have a strategy to maximize the value of its holdings.” While many Bitcoin supporters initially backed Trump for his pro-crypto facade, his latest actions have turned the community against him. In a Truth Social post over the weekend, Trump revealed that shitcoins XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) would also be part of the Strategic Crypto Reserve, after promising a Bitcon reserve on the campaign trail. Donald Trump with Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. Source: Tyler Winklevoss X/Twitter Tyler Winklevoss, a longtime Bitcoin lover, said: “I have nothing against XRP, SOL, or ADA, but I do not think they are suitable for a Strategic Reserve. Only one digital asset in the world right now meets the bar, and that digital asset is Bitcoin.” Nic Carter, co-founder of Castle Island Ventures, shares Tyler’s concerns, telling CNBC that the decision could damage Bitcoin’s long-term positioning. “The U.S. is clearly the most important nation in the world, and so their stamp of approval really does a lot for Bitcoin,” Carter said. “But by including other cryptocurrencies, it starts looking more like a speculative fund rather than a serious national reserve.” Now many in the community see Trump’s Bitcoin reserve order as nothing more than damage control, albeit executed quite poorly. In his X post, Sacks said, “This Executive Order proves President Trump’s commitment to making the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. I want to thank the President for his leadership and vision in supporting this cutting-edge technology and for his rapid execution in supporting the digital asset industry. His administration is truly moving at tech speed.” Trump’s actions keep crashing markets The broader stock market also showed weakness after the executive order, as the Nasdaq Composite has dropped by 8% since Trump’s second term began. The S&P 500 has fallen by 4.3% since Inauguration Day. The Russell 2000 sank 9.2%, one of its worst performances in 2025, per data from CNBC. According to data from CoinGecko, Bitcoin is now up 29% since the election, but down 18% since Inauguration Day, Ethereum is down 12% since the election, 37% since Inauguration Day, XRP is up 380% since the election, but down 23% since Trump’s second term began, and Solana has dropped 50% since Inauguration Day. Michael Saylor, founder of Strategy and Bitcoin’s unofficial CEO plus hype man extraordinaire, has not publicly spoken about the Bitcoin reserve news yet. Crypto-loving Senator Cynthia Lummis, who first came up with the Bitcoin reserve idea, said , “We are becoming the bitcoin and digital asset capital of the world. America is so ₿ack. Stay tuned for next week.” Before the reserve was announced, the U.S. government had a long history of selling Bitcoin at bargain prices. According to David Sacks, over the last ten years, the federal government sold 195,000 Bitcoin for just $366 million. If they had held onto it, that same Bitcoin would be worth $17 billion today. Sacks described the losses as a huge mistake. “That’s how much it has cost American taxpayers not to have a long-term strategy,” he said. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is supposed to fix that problem by ensuring that the government holds its Bitcoin, rather than dumping it at low prices. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is scheduled to appear on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” at 7 a.m. New York time on Friday, where he is expected to address concerns about how the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could affect markets. Investors will be looking for clarity on how the government plans to acquire more Bitcoin without affecting the price, since Sacks said, “I also want to thank the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets — especially Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick — for their help and support in getting this done. Finally Bo Hines played a critical role as Executive Director of our Working Group.” XRP lawyer Johnny Deaton explained to the community that: “What David is trying to tell you is that Donald Trump’s EO is unbelievably Bullish. Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick have been DIRECTED by the POTUS to find “budget neutral” ways to acquire BTC. Two years ago, we would’ve been laughed off stage for suggesting that such a thing could happen.” In a separate post, Johnny shared an idea that America should allow taxpayers to pay their federal taxes in BTC, without incurring capital gains liability, and the government can take a fraction of each tax payment (.05-1%) in BTC and forward it to the Strategic Reserve. “The Federal Government and the American taxpayer in a true partnership and both win,” said Johnny. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to speak on “Halftime Report”, where he will definitely be asked to comment on whether the Bitcoin reserve fits into the Federal Reserve’s long-term economic strategy. Bond markets have also been reacting, with the 10-year Treasury yield now at 4.27%, while the 2-year Treasury yield sits at 3.95%. Goldman Sachs analysts are speculating that the government’s Bitcoin policy could lead to changes in the bond market. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which tracks a broad range of crypto assets, is up nearly 40% since the election, but has lost 31% since January 20th.

According to a recent report by Golden Finance, this suspension is now in effect until April 2nd. For those in the cryptocurrency world, while seemingly distant, these global economic shifts can have ripple effects, influencing market sentiment and broader investment landscapes. Let’s dive into what this tariff suspension means and why it matters. Decoding the Trump Tariffs Extension: What’s Really Happening? The announcement of the extended tariffs suspension is significant as it continues a period of eased trade tensions between the U.S. and its North American neighbors, Mexico and Canada. This decision essentially means that for a specific range of goods, the additional taxes imposed under previous trade policies will remain on hold. To understand the full picture, let’s break down the key aspects: Duration of Suspension: The suspension is currently slated to last until April 2nd. This provides businesses with a temporary window of predictability in their trade operations across these borders. Countries Involved: This directly impacts trade relations between the United States, Mexico, and Canada. These three nations are key players in the global economic landscape, and their trade policies have far-reaching consequences. Goods Affected: While the specifics of which goods are included in this suspension weren’t detailed in the provided snippet, tariff suspensions generally apply to a range of imported products. Historically, these have included various commodities, manufactured goods, and agricultural products. For detailed information, you’d typically need to consult official trade announcements from the U.S. Trade Representative or similar government bodies. Source of Information: The news originates from Golden Finance, indicating its relevance to financial markets and economic news. Why Suspend Tariffs? Exploring the Benefits of Reduced Trade Barriers The suspension of trade tariffs isn’t just a random act; it’s a strategic move with potential benefits for multiple stakeholders. But what exactly are these benefits, and who stands to gain? Let’s break it down: For Businesses: Reduced Costs: Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods. Suspending them reduces the cost of importing goods, which can translate to lower prices for consumers or increased profit margins for businesses. Increased Trade Volume: Lower costs often lead to increased demand and, consequently, higher trade volumes between the nations involved. Simplified Supply Chains: Businesses with supply chains that span across the U.S., Mexico, and Canada can experience smoother operations and reduced complexities without the added layer of tariff considerations. For Consumers: Potentially Lower Prices: Cost savings for businesses can be passed down to consumers in the form of reduced prices for goods, although this isn’t always guaranteed. Greater Product Variety: Increased trade can lead to a wider variety of goods being available to consumers. For the Economy: Economic Growth: Increased trade activity can stimulate economic growth by boosting production, employment, and overall economic activity. Improved International Relations: Cooperative trade policies can strengthen diplomatic relationships between countries, fostering a more stable and predictable international environment. However, it’s crucial to remember that these benefits are often temporary and dependent on the duration and scope of the tariff suspension. Challenges and Considerations: Navigating the Complexities of USMCA and Trade Policies While the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement) aims to foster smoother trade relations, the reality of international trade is often filled with complexities and potential challenges. Even with tariff suspensions, businesses and economies must navigate a landscape that can shift rapidly. Let’s consider some of the challenges and points to ponder: Temporary Nature: The current suspension is only until April 2nd. This short-term window creates uncertainty. Businesses might be hesitant to make long-term strategic decisions based on a temporary reprieve. Geopolitical Factors: Trade policies are heavily influenced by political relations. Changes in political leadership or shifts in diplomatic priorities can quickly alter the trade landscape. Global Economic Conditions: Broader economic factors, such as global recessions, inflation, or supply chain disruptions, can overshadow the impact of tariff suspensions. Industry-Specific Impacts: The effects of tariff suspensions can vary significantly across different industries. Some sectors might benefit greatly, while others may see minimal impact or even face new challenges due to shifting trade dynamics. Long-Term Trade Strategy: A series of short-term suspensions doesn’t necessarily equate to a stable long-term trade strategy. Businesses need predictability to plan investments and operations effectively. Examples in Action: Real-World Scenarios of Tariff Impact To truly grasp the implications of Mexico and Canada tariff suspensions, considering real-world examples can be incredibly insightful. While we don’t have specific examples tied to this exact suspension yet, we can draw from past instances and general principles: Automotive Industry: The automotive sector has highly integrated supply chains across North America. Tariffs on auto parts or vehicles can significantly increase production costs, impacting manufacturers, workers, and consumers. Suspensions can offer temporary relief to this industry. Agriculture: Agricultural products are frequently subject to tariffs. For example, if the U.S. were to impose tariffs on Mexican avocados, it could lead to higher avocado prices in the U.S. Conversely, suspensions could help maintain price stability and trade flow. Consumer Goods: Many everyday consumer goods are imported. Tariffs on these items directly affect the prices consumers pay for clothing, electronics, and household items. Suspensions can ease inflationary pressures on these goods. Steel and Aluminum: In the past, tariffs on steel and aluminum imports have had a ripple effect across various industries that use these materials, from construction to manufacturing. Suspensions in these sectors can influence material costs and project viability. These examples illustrate how tariffs and their suspensions are not abstract policy decisions but have tangible effects on businesses and individuals. Actionable Insights: What Should Businesses and Investors Do? So, with this extension of the Canada and Mexico tariff suspension, what are some actionable insights for businesses and investors to consider? Monitor Trade News Closely: Stay updated on trade policy developments. Subscribe to reputable news sources, trade publications, and official government announcements related to trade. Scenario Planning: Develop contingency plans for different trade scenarios. What happens if tariffs are reinstated? What if they are further reduced or eliminated? Prepare for various possibilities. Supply Chain Review: Assess your supply chains. Are they overly reliant on imports from specific regions? Can diversification mitigate risks associated with trade policy changes? Engage with Industry Associations: Industry associations often advocate for their members’ interests in trade policy discussions. Engaging with these groups can provide valuable insights and collective action opportunities. Seek Expert Advice: Consult with trade lawyers, economists, and consultants to get tailored advice on navigating the complexities of international trade and tariff policies. For those in the cryptocurrency and broader financial markets, understanding these global trade dynamics is crucial as they can indirectly influence market sentiment and investment strategies. Conclusion: A Temporary Truce or a Shift in Trade Winds? Donald Trump’s extension of the tariff suspension on Mexican and Canadian goods offers a moment of relief in the ongoing saga of international trade relations. It provides businesses with a temporary reprieve and hints at a continued, albeit potentially fragile, truce in trade tensions within North America. However, the short-term nature of this suspension underscores the volatile and politically influenced nature of modern trade policies. Businesses and investors must remain vigilant, adaptable, and informed as the global trade landscape continues to evolve.

Under this plan, the U.S. government will create a “digital Fort Knox” to store Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies seized in civil or criminal cases. The reserve aims to preserve these digital assets for long-term value, marking a significant shift in how the government handles seized crypto. David Sacks, Trump’s crypto czar, shared the latest development in a latest X post . “The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime,” Sacks remarked. US To Preserve ‘The Digital Gold’ He also noted that while the U.S. government owns around 200,000 Bitcoin, however a full audit of these assets has never been conducted. The new executive order calls for a comprehensive accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings. The U.S. will not sell any Bitcoin stored in the Reserve; instead, it will be preserved as a long-term store of value. The Reserve is essentially a digital version of Fort Knox, designed to safeguard the cryptocurrency known as “digital gold.” The U.S. government has already lost over $17 billion in value from selling Bitcoin too early, but now the federal government has a new plan to maximise the value of its Bitcoin holdings. The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce will develop strategies to acquire more Bitcoin without costing taxpayers any extra money. The Executive Order also creates a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, which will store digital assets aside from Bitcoin, that are seized in criminal or civil cases. The government will only add assets to the Stockpile from forfeiture cases, not by purchasing them. Sacks emphasized that the Stockpile’s goal is to responsibly manage the government’s digital assets, under the supervision of the Treasury Department. Promises Made, Promises Kept! President Trump had previously promised to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile and now, those promises are being fulfilled. Sacks highlights that this Executive Order highlights his ongoing commitment to positioning the U.S. as the “crypto capital of the world,” taking significant steps toward integrating digital assets into the nation’s financial future. Sacks expressed his gratitude and admiration to the President for his leadership and vision in supporting this cutting-edge technology and for his rapid execution in supporting the digital asset industry. He remarked that Trump administration is truly moving at “tech speed.” He also mentioned the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets—particularly Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick—for their crucial support in bringing this to fruition.

The reserve will hold an estimated 200,000 BTC, marking a significant shift in U.S. financial strategy and reinforcing Bitcoin’s role in the global economy. BREAKING: President Trump signs executive order officially creating a #Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. pic.twitter.com/MiyTAbRkE2 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 7, 2025 David Sacks, President Trump’s Crypto Czar, provided further clarification on the newly established reserve, stating that the reserve will be funded by Bitcoin already owned by the federal government, specifically assets forfeited in criminal and civil asset forfeiture proceedings. “This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime,” he emphasized. The executive order also mandates a comprehensive audit of the federal government’s Bitcoin holdings, as the exact quantity of BTC under U.S. control has never been fully accounted for. Sacks noted: “It is estimated that the U.S. government owns about 200,000 bitcoin; however, there has never been a complete audit. The E.O. directs a full accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings.” A key provision of the executive order ensures that the government will not sell any Bitcoin deposited into the reserve. Instead, it will serve as a long-term store of value, with Sacks likening it to “a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold.’” Highlighting past financial missteps, Sacks explained how premature sales of Bitcoin by the government have cost taxpayers over $17 billion in lost value. With the new reserve, the administration seeks to avoid such losses while strategically maximizing Bitcoin’s long-term value. Additionally, the executive order grants the Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce the authority to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring more Bitcoin, provided that such acquisitions come at no incremental cost to American taxpayers. The executive order also establishes a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, which will include non-Bitcoin digital assets seized in forfeiture proceedings. However, no additional assets will be acquired for this stockpile beyond those obtained through such means. Sacks concluded by praising the administration’s commitment to digital assets: “President Trump promised to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile. Those promises have been kept.” He credited key officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Executive Director Bo Hines, for their role in executing this initiative. This landmark decision positions the United States at the forefront of the global Bitcoin economy. With this move, President Trump’s administration is signaling a bold embrace of Bitcoin as a core component of national financial strategy.

The first key resistance is near the $90,000 level. There is also a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $89,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $92,741 swing high to the $84,665 low. The next key resistance could be $92,000. A close above the $92,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $93,500 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $95,000 level or even $96,200. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $90,000 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $87,000 level. The first major support is near the $86,200 level. The next support is now near the $85,000 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $82,000 support in the near term. The main support sits at $80,000. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $87,000, followed by $85,000.

Solana has dropped by 13%, making investors unsure about its immediate future. At the same time, Dogecoin, previously popular among casual investors, continues to reach new lows as people look for other options. Amid these downturns, Web3Bay stands out by collecting an impressive $1.6 million during its presale. While well-known cryptocurrencies face difficulties, Web3Bay’s growth has experts suggesting it could be the next big success in crypto. Investor Concerns Increase as Solana’s Price Drops Solana is well-known in the blockchain space for its fast processing times. Yet, its price has recently fallen by 13% due to increased selling. The price drop to $136 has raised alarms among its investors. Factors like a general drop in crypto interest, profits being taken by large investors, and a loss of momentum after failing to hit new highs are hurting its value. If Solana’s price falls below important levels, it might keep dropping for a while. Still, some believe Solana might recover. If it stays above $130, it could possibly reach its former higher prices. But, the ongoing price uncertainty and general market volatility are pushing many to consider investing in other, more promising projects. Dogecoin’s Struggles Indicate Decreasing Interest in Meme Coins Dogecoin, known for its viral start as a meme coin, is also in trouble. Its price has fallen to all-time lows as enthusiasm wanes and the market turns to projects with more practical uses. Dogecoin hasn’t seen significant new developments, making it prone to further losses as investors move their money to more impactful projects. The initial excitement over speculative profits from Dogecoin is fading, unable to keep the coin in significant growth. With no major new uses or activities, Dogecoin is losing its appeal. Investors are now shifting focus to newer ventures like Web3Bay, which promises real-world uses and substantial return potential. Web3Bay Thrives as Solana and Dogecoin Struggle While Solana and Dogecoin face challenges, Web3Bay is on a rising path, already gathering over $1.6 million in its presale. Investors see the value in Web3Bay’s approach to reshaping e-commerce. By eliminating intermediaries, the platform cuts costs and enhances security for users through blockchain technology. It offers a direct, user-empowered alternative to traditional online shopping dominated by large corporations. Currently priced at $0.00524 in its presale, with an expected launch price of $0.1959, early backers could see returns exceeding 3,633%. The robust demand for 3BAY tokens reflects strong faith in Web3Bay’s future, marking it as a prime investment choice amid today’s market. Unlike Dogecoin, which relies on community appeal but lacks broader utility, or Solana, which contends with numerous competitors, Web3Bay introduces a practical, applicable innovation. This real-world utility sets it apart from faltering assets, drawing investors focused on substantial, rather than merely speculative, returns. Why Web3Bay Positions as a Top Investment Option Recent market lows reveal a clear trend: investors are shifting from unstable ventures to those offering substantial utility and growth potential. Solana’s difficulties show that even well-known cryptocurrencies can falter under market stress, while Dogecoin’s decline underscores the waning allure of meme coins. Meanwhile, Web3Bay, still in its crypto presale , presents immense growth possibilities. As the presale progresses, its future looks increasingly bright. Web3Bay’s model of decentralized e-commerce not only serves a critical need but also promises enduring relevance beyond just market speculation. Early investors who tap into this potential early could see significant benefits. As other large cryptocurrencies like Solana and Dogecoin navigate through fluctuations, Web3Bay’s consistent progress hints at its potential as one of the most lucrative investments this year. With its presale success and growing demand, the window for getting in early is closing fast.

The “budget neutral” purchases would be above and beyond the seized trove of BTC that Trump has ordered the US to hold onto as a strategic reserve. Sacks has confirmed initial reporting from Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, who laid out the difference between the Bitcoin reserve and stockpile on the social media platform X. “Trump’s Executive Order calls for two separate things — a strategic reserve and a stockpile. The strategic reserve will contain only BTC (the digital asset with the most store of value) using the 200,000 or so tokens already in the government’s possession that has been seized over the years through criminal and civil forfeiture. Sacks says [Treasury Secretary] Bessent and [Commerce Secretary] Lutnick have also been given authorization to explore means of acquiring more bitcoin through avenues that will not cost the taxpayer. Separately, a digital asset stockpile will be created that includes other cryptocurrencies aside from bitcoin using seized assets already owned by the government.” The price of Bitcoin dropped as news of Trump’s new executive order spread a few hours ago. After sinking from $90,251 to an intra-day low of $85,091, BTC is now $87,476 at time of publishing.

According to Sacks’ Mar. 7 announcement on his official X handle, the reserve will be funded with Bitcoin ( BTC ) seized by the federal government through asset forfeiture, meaning taxpayers will not bear any cost. Sacks estimated that the U.S. government holds around 200,000 BTC, though a full audit has never been conducted. The executive order mandates a complete accounting of federal digital asset holdings and prohibits the sale of Bitcoin in the reserve , likening it to a “digital Fort Knox.” Just a few minutes ago, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it… — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 7, 2025 With Trump reiterating his goal of making the United States the “crypto capital of the world,” the move seeks to improve the nation’s standing in the crypto industry. Additionally, the order establishes a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile that will contain other non-Bitcoin digital assets that have been seized through forfeiture. However, the government will not acquire additional crypto beyond these means. You might also like: Texas House to advance or reject Bitcoin bill by May 24 Trump’s administration is also directing the Treasury and Commerce Departments to explore budget-neutral methods for acquiring more Bitcoin without additional costs to taxpayers. Sacks noted that previous government Bitcoin sales cost taxpayers over $17 billion in lost value. At press time, Bitcoin is down 3% in the past 24 hours at $86,600, and the market has not yet responded to the news. However, the regulation may reduce government sell-offs of Bitcoin, signaling a long-term positive catalyst . This might tighten supply and solidify Bitcoin’s position as a gold-like strategic asset if the government starts accumulating it instead of selling it. In other policy decisions, Trump also signed executive actions delaying tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports for nearly a month. According to Trump on Truth Social, after discussions with Canadian officials and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, goods covered by the USMCA trade agreement will continue to be free of tariffs. Goods that are not covered under the USMCA, such as avocados and Canadian energy, could still be subject to duties.

ETH is now consolidating and facing hurdles near the $2,220 resistance. Ethereum started a fresh upward move above the $2,120 support zone. The price is trading below $2,220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key rising channel with support at $2,220 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $2,220 and $2,320 resistance levels to start a decent increase. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price started a decent increase from the $2,000 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH climbed above the $2,120 and $2,200 resistance levels. However, the bears were active near $2,320 and pushed the price back below $2,220. There was a break below a key rising channel with support at $2,220 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. A low was formed at $2,103 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the $2,120 and $2,150 resistance levels. It cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,319 swing high to the $2,103 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,220 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,319 swing high to the $2,103 low. The next key resistance is near the $2,275 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,320 level. A clear move above the $2,320 resistance might send the price toward the $2,420 resistance. An upside break above the $2,420 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,500 resistance zone or even $2,550 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,220 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,100 level. The first major support sits near the $2,050 zone. A clear move below the $2,050 support might push the price toward the $2,000 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,880 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,740.

The cryptocurrency briefly surged to $92,756 in the early hours of today before retracing to $90,279, marking a 0.7% increase in the past 24 hours. While price action remains volatile, market sentiment indicators are signaling a crucial phase for Bitcoin’s trajectory, according to CryptoQuant analyst Woominkyu. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Stop: $75,500? Analyst Reveals Historical ‘Magnet’ Level Bitcoin’s Market Cycle: Entering the Optimism Stage In a recent analysis titled “FOMO is Not Here Yet”, Woominkyu highlights Bitcoin’s Fear & Greed Index, which tracks overall investor sentiment. The index, based on a 30-day moving average (SMA 30), maps Bitcoin’s market cycles to different psychological stages observed in past rallies. This indicator has historically helped identify when Bitcoin is in the early stages of a bull run—or when excessive optimism may lead to corrections. According to Woominkyu, Bitcoin has now entered the “Optimism Stage”, a phase historically associated with the early stages of a strong rally. In past cycles, when Bitcoin reached this level, the market often gained upward momentum, leading to further price increases. However, the analyst warns that if the index continues rising toward the Euphoria Stage, it could indicate excessive market optimism, which has often preceded steep corrections. The key observation from Woominkyu’s analysis is that, despite Bitcoin’s recovery, FOMO (fear of missing out) has not yet fully set in among investors. This suggests that while sentiment is improving, Bitcoin is not yet in a speculative bubble. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether the market follows past patterns—moving higher from the Optimism Stage—or if external factors push Bitcoin into a correction. Whale Activity In The Market While sentiment indicators provide insights into market psychology, whale activity is another key factor influencing Bitcoin’s price movement. A separate analysis by maartunn, another CryptoQuant contributor, has revealed that whale deposits to Binance have reached a three-month high, with over $7.3 billion worth of Bitcoin sent to the exchange in the past 30 days. These movements suggest that large-scale investors are actively positioning themselves, which could lead to increased volatility in the market.

The Bitcoin, all obtained through civil or criminal forfeitures, will be stored for long-term value in a “digital Fort Knox.” David Sacks, Trump’s Crypto Czar shared this in an X post . Besides, the order encourages officials to find ways to add more Bitcoin to the reserve, as long as it doesn’t hurt the federal budget. It also calls for a stockpile of other cryptocurrencies seized by the government. While Sacks didn’t name specific assets, recent remarks from the president suggest which ones might be included. This move could give the U.S. a bigger presence in the world of digital assets. US Loses $16B Due To Premature Selling Notably, the U.S. government has been sitting on a large amount of Bitcoin and may have missed out on significant profits by selling it too early. The new executive order seeks to correct this by creating a reserve that will keep these assets for the long term. According to Lookonchain , the U.S. government’s public wallet currently holds 198,109 BTC, valued at approximately $16.92 billion. Historically, the government has transferred around 222,684 BTC to platforms like Coinbase, Coinbase Prime, and other unknown wallets. These transactions took place at an average price of $14,736 per Bitcoin, totaling about $3.28 billion at the time. However, with Bitcoin’s current market price, those same 222,684 BTC are now worth about $19.42 billion. This means that the U.S. government has incurred a loss of roughly $16.14 billion due to selling Bitcoin prematurely. This highlights the missed potential value as Bitcoin’s price continues to rise, reinforcing the need for a strategy that preserves these digital assets for long-term value, as outlined in the new executive order. Market Reactions Bitcoin dropped nearly 5% to $85,000 shortly after the order was announced, possibly due to disappointment that the reserve only includes tokens already held by the government, with no new purchases for now. Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL) also witnessed sharp drops of 4%-8%, as the order doesn’t allow for new government buys of these cryptocurrencies.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|TRADING|ADA|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-07 03:30:17

In a Mar. 7 post on X, Coutts cited historical evidence that indicates notable declines in the DXY frequently align with large uptrends in Bitcoin ( BTC ). He conducted a backtest on cases in which the DXY dropped more than 2% and discovered that Bitcoin had an average gain of 31.6% and a 94% win rate over the next 90 days. In addition, Bitcoin posted gains 100% of the time, averaging 37% return, when the DXY fell more than 2.5 percent. Coutts believes Bitcoin will reach a new all-time high by May based on these trends. When looking at this recent move in the DXY through a historical lens, its challenging to be anything but bullish.

Investors often turn to alternative stores of value, such as Bitcoin, when the dollar weakens. You might also like: Will Bitcoin price hit $100k as investors eye Trump’s crypto summit? The recent decline in the DXY coincides with market turbulence, which has been fuelled by Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico, together with his administration’s renewed push for a national crypto strategic reserve and clearer regulations. At the same time, the upcoming Crypto Summit has boosted speculations in the industry. After recent market turbulence, Bitcoin is trading around $87,800, down 4% in the past 24 hours as at the time of press. But the trajectory of altcoins remains mixed. Although there has been some recovery in solid projects, the market as a whole is still suffering from heavy sell-offs. According to Coutts, the 365-day new lows in the Top 200 crypto index reached 47%, a signal of capitulation typically seen before bullish reversals. If historical trends hold, a declining dollar and growing institutional confidence may be driving Bitcoin and altcoins into a period of sustained gains. Given the uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve’s next actions, macroeconomic issues may have an even greater impact on the direction of the market in the short term.

According to Sacks’ Mar. 7 announcement on his official X handle, the reserve will be funded with Bitcoin ( BTC ) seized by the federal government through asset forfeiture, meaning taxpayers will not bear any cost. Just a few minutes ago, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it… — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 7, 2025 Sacks estimated that the U.S. government holds around 200,000 BTC, though a full audit has never been conducted. The executive order mandates a complete accounting of federal digital asset holdings and prohibits the sale of Bitcoin in the reserve , likening it to a “digital Fort Knox.” With Trump reiterating his goal of making the United States the “crypto capital of the world,” the move seeks to improve the nation’s standing in the crypto industry. Additionally, the order establishes a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile that will contain other non-Bitcoin digital assets that have been seized through forfeiture. However, the government will not acquire additional crypto beyond these means. Trump’s administration is also directing the Treasury and Commerce Departments to explore budget-neutral methods for acquiring more Bitcoin without additional costs to taxpayers. Sacks noted that previous government Bitcoin sales cost taxpayers over $17 billion in lost value. At press time, Bitcoin is down 3% in the past 24 hours at $86,600, and the market has not yet responded to the news. However, the regulation may reduce government sell-offs of Bitcoin, signaling a long-term positive catalyst . This might tighten supply and solidify Bitcoin’s position as a gold-like strategic asset if the government starts accumulating it instead of selling it. In other policy decisions, Trump also signed executive actions delaying tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports for nearly a month. According to Trump on Truth Social, after discussions with Canadian officials and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, goods covered by the USMCA trade agreement will continue to be free of tariffs.

Crypto enthusiasts and investors predict that the RXS will be among the top gainers in 2025 as it is expected to pump from $0.20 to $25 in six months. RXS rises as an outstanding XRP competitor RXS is expected to vie for dominance against the XRP which has long been in control of blockchain financial transactions. Rexas Finance’s RXS has emerged as a viable XRP substitute among crypto traders due to its countless possibilities for expansion. RXS is reportedly about to become one of the ‘hottest’ altcoins in 2025 due to Rexas Finance’s emphasis on the expansion of the tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) pool, seamless financial transactions, and the fast accumulation of tokenized shares. The Rexas Finance platform is designed to streamline the process of producing and maintaining digital tokens—especially those reflecting real-world assets. RXS will employ blockchain technology to facilitate accountable asset ownership and transfer of real estate, goods, and intellectual property. Rexas Finance’s ‘democratization of asset tokenization’ creates a world of possibilities for investors, allowing them to engage in high-value markets with few obstacles. RXS will provide real use cases that solve actual financial inefficiencies. Rexas Finance’s strategy will position it as a major contender in the tokenized RWA sector. RXS’s presale success suggests future significant growth RXS’s presale has shown an amazing trend as it passes through stage 12, with the altcoin generating nearly $46.14 million at $0.20 per RXS. Nearly 90.15% of Rexas Finance’s targeted $56 million worth of RXS set aside for the presale has been sold, reflecting strong demand. RXS’s inclusive vision prioritizes public presales over venture capital funds, allowing ordinary people to join the financial revolution. The altcoin’s listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko will improved its visibility and investor confidence, boosting the presale momentum. Moreover, the RXS team plans to list the altcoin on three top exchanges when the presale ends, ensuring notable liquidity and availability for traders upon the token’s launch. RXS’s starting price of $0.25 and a verified launch date of June 19th will likely set the stage for a historic price explosion. Rexas Finance’s openness and commitment to security are among the key factors encouraging investor confidence in the RXS altcoin. The blockchain security firm Certik has completed the assessment and approval of the RXS initiative, which almost guarantees the dependability and safety of RXS’s smart contracts. The degree of examination has reassured institutional and individual investors, thereby supporting stage 12’s presale success. RXS’s strength reportedly goes beyond security to include usability. Both individual and institutional investors will be able to access tokenized assets ranging from real estate to artwork. The RXS asset will be ‘fractionalized’ to allow regular investors to enter previously unreachable markets. RXS price is projected to rise 12400% in six months RXS’s upside potential is mostly created by the buzz around it. Analysts estimate that the token will spike to $25 within six months, representing a 12400x return on investment. Important elements forming the basis of this projection include growing usage, exchange listings, and the broader market upswing projected in 2025. Crypto’s strong utility and adoption has grown exponentially during positive market cycles. XRP rose rapidly during one of the previous positive market cycles, but now investors are looking to RXS as the next breakout coin. RXS will likely be the biggest surprise of 2025 given its increasing community backing. Conclusion RXS will directly compete against XRP by offering an alternative method for real-world asset tokenization, and providing practical use cases for both individual and institutional investors. RXS’s projected price hike from $0.20 to reach $25 in just six months emphasizes a possibility for early investors. Rexas Finance (RXS) is expected to be among the top gainers of 2025.

The US government holds around 200,000 BTC, according to estimates and the executive order “directs a full accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings,” said Sacks. “The US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency, often called ‘digital gold’.” Just a few minutes ago, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it… — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 7, 2025 No Buying More Crypto Sacks also said that premature sales of BTC “have already cost US taxpayers over $17 billion in lost value” before adding, “Now the federal government will have a strategy to maximize the value of its holdings.” The EO also establishes a US digital asset stockpile consisting of crypto other than Bitcoin forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings. However, the government “will not acquire additional assets for the stockpile” beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings, he said. This means that it will not be buying Ethereum, XRP, Solana, or Cardano, as Trump mentioned earlier this week. The concept was ridiculed by several industry executives and analysts after it was proposed by Trump on March 2 because he mentioned a handful of altcoins that many prominent Bitcoiners labeled as “shitcoins.” “President Trump promised to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile. Those promises have been kept,” Sacks concluded. Crypto Market Tanks It appears that the crypto market is also deriding the notion that Uncle Sam will be stockpiling digital assets as it has tanked by more than $200 billion, or 5%, since the announcement, despite analysts calling it bullish . As a result, total capitalization is now back below $3 trillion. Bitcoin dumped $5,000 in an hour or so, crashing from around $90,000 to $85,000 before it recovered to around $87,000, while Ethereum fell a similar 5% to $2,150 after the announcement. Unsurprisingly, XRP, SOL, and ADA were hit particularly hard, falling 8%, 7%, and 10% respectively.

Simultaneously, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP prices followed by dropping 1-6% in the interim. Meme coins also traded mainly in the red zone on Friday, with the broader sector’s action collectively sparking severe investor concerns despite the latest pro-crypto advancements. Crypto Market Today: BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP Wane Despite U.S. Crypto Reserve Establishment The global crypto market lost nearly 4% value today as the market cap shrank to $2.88 trillion despite pro-cryptocurrency advancements in the U.S. President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve nationwide. Further, the order also focused on creating a ‘Digital Asset Stockpile’ in the U.S. that consists of crypto other than BTC. However, despite these much-awaited pro-crypto developments, prices today encounter considerable volatility. BTC Price Hits $84K Low Again After showcasing a recovery-like trend, BTC price again leaves hope sinking as it fell over 4% to $87,071 at the time of reporting. Besides, CoinMarketCap’s data showed that the coin bottomed at $84,717.68 over the past day.

Besides, with $259.24 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data, Bitcoin continues to face turbulence. Even BTC futures OI slipped 4.6% today and closed in at $48.48 billion, signaling declining market interest despite favorable developments.

The second-largest coin by market cap wanes alongside $72.04 million worth of liquidations recorded over the past day.

XRP Price Slips 1% XRP price witnessed a drop of slightly over 1% and is currently sitting at $2.47. The coin hit an intraday low and high of $2.39 and $2.64, respectively.

Conversely, the coin’s future prospects remain optimistic amid rising XRP whale accumulations . SOL Price Loses 5% SOL price witnessed a 5% downfall in the past 24 hours and closed in at $141. The coin swooped to a $135.72 low and a high of $152.78 intraday. Even Solana registered $21.67 million worth of liquidations, aligning with the tumbling action. Meme Crypto Market In The Red Simultaneously, Dogecoin (DOGE) price pulled back nearly 5% and exchanged hands at $0.1967. Shiba Inu (SHIB) price lost over 2% and stood at $0.00001318. Even Pepe Coin (PEPE) price lost 6% and exchanged hands at $0.000006717. Altogether, the meme coin market mirrors broader trends. Top Gainers In The Crypto Market Today Some tokens appear to have defied the fading market trend today, entering the green zone. Movement (MOVE) Price: $0.4945 24-Hour Gains: +5% MOVE price soars alongside Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial’s rising accumulations for the token, per recent Spotonchain X post.

Renowned crypto analyst Josh Olszewicz (known on X as @CarpeNoctom) shared a detailed Ichimoku-based chart, highlighting a possible Head and Shoulders formation. According to Olszewicz, a sustained break above $2.85 would likely invalidate bearish concerns tied to this classic reversal setup. Can XRP Bust Through $2.85? XRP’s most recent rally took shape in mid-October 2024, when it traded near $0.48 before rising sharply toward $3.3999 in early 2025. This rally unfolded quickly, hinting at robust buying pressure and a strong bullish sentiment through the end of 2024. However, after hitting that local peak of roughly $3.40, XRP has pulled back toward the $2.50 area, creating a pivot region that now defines the immediate trend direction. On Olszewicz’s chart, which employs Ichimoku settings of (20, 60, 120, 30), the price hovers near the Conversion Line (Tenkan-Sen) around $2.4750 while the Base Line (Kijun-Sen) sits closer to $2.5749. The Ichimoku Cloud itself projects forward, with Senkou Span A around $2.57 and Senkou Span B near $1.94, forming a green band that suggests broader bullish support as long as price stays above the Cloud. The chart shows that XRP has so far managed to remain above most Ichimoku levels, reflecting ongoing positive momentum despite recent volatility. Related Reading: XRP Price Retraces Gains From Sunday Rally, This Important Support Level Could Be The Defining Factor Within this framework, the Head and Shoulders formation looms as a potential signal of a bearish reversal. The formation appears to be anchored by a head near $3.3999, with potential “shoulders” close to the $2.85 and $2.90 zone. According to Olszewicz, a move above $2.85 should help negate the likelihood of a bearish breakdown, while sustained rejection below that level keeps the Head and Shoulders possibility firmly in play. Market participants will also be watching the $2.0 region, often interpreted as the neckline zone for this formation, because a decisive drop beneath it may confirm the reversal pattern. Additional price regions highlighted by the chart add clarity to the bullish-bearish tug-of-war. The Kijun-Sen around $2.5749 serves as an important medium-term pivot, frequently acting as both support and resistance in Ichimoku analysis. Meanwhile, the bottom of the Ichimoku Cloud near $1.94 stands as a last line of defence for bulls, should any deeper pullback occur. Related Reading: XRP Could Start An Explosive Move To $33 Within 28 Days, Says Analyst Ultimately, the broader sentiment hinges on whether XRP can break above the $2.85 threshold and thereby nullify the threat of this Head and Shoulders formation. If the market reclaims levels above that price zone, it would suggest bullish momentum remains intact. Conversely, failure to overcome $2.85, combined with a drop below $2.0, could point to a deeper reversal and invite further selling pressure. At press time, XRP traded at $2.60.

In a Mar. 7 post on X, Thorn noted that while the government currently holds about 198,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ), 112,000 BTC must be returned to Bitfinex following a previous seizure. This means that only a portion of the assets, a maximum of 88,000 BTC, can be used for the reserve. we think current US bitcoin balance available for re-purpose into a reserve is max 88k BTC, only 43% of current government holdings. that’s bc of the ~198k BTC now held by USG, 112k BTC will be returned to bitfinex market will learn the difference between “seized” & “forfeited” — Alex Thorn (@intangiblecoins) March 7, 2025 According to White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks, the initial Bitcoin for the reserve is supposed to come from seized digital assets, ensuring no additional cost to taxpayers. However, Thorn’s analysis suggests that only forfeited Bitcoin, rather than all seized holdings, can be repurposed, significantly reducing the reserve’s potential size. Thorn also pointed out that Bitcoin accounts for 97.7% of the government’s digital assets, and that percentage increases to 98% when Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC ) is taken into account. Trump’s decision to establish the reserve has been widely praised in the crypto space. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong called it a “historic moment for Bitcoin and crypto,” predicting that other G20 nations will take notice and potentially follow the U.S.’s lead.

This regulatory change, he said, would encourage more nations, wealth managers, financial organizations, and even state governments to buy Bitcoin. The end game was never “the U.S. government buys all of the world’s bitcoin.” A U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve means… – Other countries will buy bitcoin – Wealth managers have no excuse – Financial institutions have no excuse – Pensions/Endowments have no excuse – Fear of the… https://t.co/iAoyeo3PYL — Ryan Rasmussen (@RasterlyRock) March 7, 2025 According to Rasmussen, the ruling also lessens the possibility that the US will impose strict rules on Bitcoin. It would be ineffective to ban or regulate Bitcoin because the government actively owns it. As a result, industry experts believe this policy shift fundamentally changes Bitcoin’s narrative. Bitcoin continues to hold its strong position despite recent market turbulence, trading at around $87,800 at the time of press.

While some projects are riding new waves of adoption, others are experiencing shifts in trading volume and investor sentiment. Bonk has been dealing with a drop in trading volume despite seeing price movement, and Shiba Inu continues to solidify its place in the market as adoption grows. But the biggest move of all? BTFD Coin’s presale is turning heads, offering a massive 3650% ROI potential for those who jump in before it hits the exchanges. Meme coins have gone from simple Internet jokes to full-fledged financial assets, with billion-dollar market caps and major utility. While Bonk and Shiba Inu maintain their status among top meme tokens, BTFD Coin is leading the pack among the top new meme coins to buy and hold for short term with its P2E game, 90% APY staking, and referral program. With over $6.26 million raised and a 100% bonus offer still active, investors aren’t just watching BTFD—they’re diving in headfirst. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – Bulls Are Charging as 3650% ROI Potential Gains Attention How often does a presale meme coin generate this kind of excitement? With over 71 billion BTFD tokens sold and 11,200+ investors already on board, BTFD Coin is proving that meme coins can be more than just hype. Unlike others in the space, BTFD offers actual utility, with a live Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, high staking rewards, and a referral program that incentivizes growth. For those looking for life-changing returns, BTFD Coin’s numbers tell the story. At just $0.00016 per token in Stage 14, early investors have an opportunity to see their investment multiply once BTFD reaches its projected $0.006 price. Let’s break it down: A $7,000 investment at $0.00016 per token secures 43.75 million BTFD tokens. Once BTFD lists at $0.0006, that investment would be worth $26,250. But here’s where it gets wild—if BTFD reaches its moon price of $0.006, that same $7,000 could transform into a massive $262,500, making it one of the top new meme coins to buy and hold for short term with explosive growth potential. The hype doesn’t stop there. BTFD Coin recently burned all unsold tokens from Stage 13, tightening supply and boosting demand. And right now, investors can double their purchase with the 100% BONUS CODE (LAUNCH100). How to Buy BTFD Coin? Purchasing BTFD is a simple process. Set up a wallet with MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, connect to the presale page , enter the amount you wish to buy, apply the LAUNCH100 bonus code, and confirm the transaction. Once the presale ends, you’ll be able to claim your tokens before listing. With only two stages left in the presale, now is the perfect time to own the dip and run with the bulls. Bonk (BONK) – Trading Volume Dips, but the Community Remains Active Bonk has become a staple in the Solana ecosystem, with a strong community behind it. Initially launched as an airdrop for the Solana community, Bonk quickly became one of the most talked-about meme coins, leading to a significant price increase. Recently, however, Bonk has faced a dip in trading volume, down 14.22%, despite a 4.03% price increase in the last 24 hours. This suggests that while there’s still buying interest, the momentum has slowed. Even so, Bonk remains an active player in the meme coin market, with many investors keeping a close eye on potential future breakouts. With its origins rooted in community-driven tokenomics, Bonk has successfully positioned itself as a major Solana meme coin, often compared to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Whether it can reignite its rally depends on how the market reacts to its next moves. Shiba Inu (SHIB) – Price Action Suggests Growing Market Confidence Shiba Inu has proven that meme coins can evolve into full ecosystems. No longer just a Dogecoin competitor, SHIB now offers DeFi utility, NFT integration, and a growing acceptance as a payment method worldwide. The Ethereum-based token is currently trading at $0.00001351, up 3.48% in the last 24 hours but still down 7.95% over the past week. While this dip might concern some traders, long-term SHIB holders see it as an opportunity to accumulate more before its next big move. Shiba Inu’s development team continues pushing its ecosystem forward, with projects like Shibarium, a layer-2 scaling solution, and SHIB: The Metaverse set to roll out. These developments could make Shiba Inu more than just a meme coin, securing its place as a long-term investment option. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, meme coins continue to dominate discussions in the crypto world, with BTFD Coin, Bonk, and Shiba Inu leading the charge. While Bonk is dealing with shifts in trading volume and Shiba Inu maintains its long-term expansion, BTFD Coin is capturing major attention with its 3650% ROI potential, P2E game, and lucrative staking rewards. With over $6.26 million raised and a 100% bonus offer still available, BTFD’s presale is one of the biggest opportunities in the market right now. Investors looking for short-term gains and long-term potential might find BTFD to be the perfect entry point into meme coin investing. As one of the top new meme coins to buy and hold for short term, its momentum is undeniable. The question now is—are you ready to own the dip before the next bull run? Join the BTFD Coin presale now before prices move up. FAQs Why is BTFD Coin considered one of the top new meme coins to buy and hold for short term? BTFD Coin’s massive presale success, staking rewards, and P2E game have set it apart. With a 3650% ROI potential, it’s drawing investors looking for high-growth meme coins. What’s happening with Bonk’s trading volume? Bonk has seen a drop in trading volume by 14.22% but remains a strong player in the Solana ecosystem. Its price has increased recently, showing signs of potential movement. Is Shiba Inu still a good investment? Shiba Inu continues expanding its ecosystem, with Shibarium and NFT integrations making it more than just a meme coin. While its price fluctuates, many believe in its long-term potential.

The executive order announcement came just ahead of the White House’s highly anticipated industry summit, where crypto leaders will meet with members of Trump’s administration to discuss policy. Many had been eagerly expecting the president to reveal details of the crypto reserve either before or during the event, making the timing even more significant. Industry Experts Weigh In- Industry experts are now weighing in on the potential impacts of the U.S. government’s decision to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Matt Hougan, the CIO of Bitwise outlines the key impacts of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. He noted that this move dramatically reduces the likelihood that the US government would some day “ban” bitcoin. Further, he also believes that this would dramatically increases the likelihood that other nations will establish strategic bitcoin reserves following the steps of US. This means that the U.S. decision to establish a Bitcoin reserve creates a race for other countries to creates a sense of urgency to act quickly. Other nations may rush to create their own Bitcoin reserves before the U.S. buys more, potentially driving up the price. This gives them a limited time to secure Bitcoin at current prices. Additionally, this move makes it harder for institutions, like financial advisors and organizations such as the IMF, to argue that Bitcoin is too risky or unsuitable to hold. It shows that even the U.S. government sees Bitcoin as a valuable asset. “Establishing a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile is a huge moment for both crypto and American leadership on the global stage,” remarked Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of Anchorage Digital, one of the business leaders who is set to attend the roundtable. Criticisms Prevail However, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, criticized the U.S. government’s Bitcoin reserve strategy, calling it “underwhelming and disappointing.” He argued that without a plan to buy more Bitcoin, the reserve strategy is essentially superficial and lacks meaningful impact, Presidential orders don’t carry the same legal weight as laws passed by Congress, so it’s still uncertain how Trump’s administration will handle the specifics of the order, which hadn’t been fully revealed by Thursday night. Additionally, the exact value of the U.S. government’s current crypto holdings remains unclear.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-07 05:22:55

While Cardano shows signs reminiscent of its exponential 2020–2021 rally, a fresh competitor, Rexas Finance, is carving out its own niche by attracting significant investor attention. So, can Cardano price climb to new heights while this newcomer carves out its own space? Let’s dive in. Cardano Price: On the Verge of a Breakout? Cardano price action in early 2025 has been a mix of volatility and promise. After experiencing a 20% decline, ADA rebounded with a swift 25% surge, suggesting that while the market remains erratic, profitable opportunities could be on the horizon. This potentially poses Cardano as one of the best cheap cryptocurrencies to invest in right now. Analysts are closely watching the critical $0.87 resistance level—a benchmark that, if surpassed, might unlock a strong upward trend similar to the modest growth phase preceding Cardano’s massive 2020–2021 rally. Back then, ADA enjoyed a period of steady growth before exploding by over 2,000%. Although the current rally is more measured, many investors are optimistic that history may be repeating itself. With ADA trading at around $0.85 and forecasts predicting an average price of approximately $1.19 in Q2 2025, climbing past its previous all-time high of $3.10 (set in 2021), and potentially reaching $5 or more if market conditions align. A successful breach of the $0.87 level could catalyze a rally that propels Cardano to new heights, offering an attractive return on investment. Cardano (ADA) price chart Rexas Finance (RXS): The Rising Altcoin In the midst of Cardano price anticipated surge, Rexas Finance (RXS) is emerging as a compelling contender in the altcoin space. Currently undervalued at $0.20, RXS is nearing the end of its presale phase and has already raised over $46 million toward its $56 million target, with more than 90% of the tokens sold. This level of activity signals robust community support and investor interest in the RWA token . Scheduled for a full token launch at $0.25 on June 19, 2025, Rexas Finance is poised for explosive growth. Set to fully launch its tokens at $0.25 on June 19, 2025, Rexas Finance is ready for significant expansion. Certain industry projections even foresee an exponential surge, with the altcoin possibly climbing to $18 by year’s end—a notable projected rise of 9,000%. As one of promising early-stage cryptocurrencies , RXS distinguishes itself from other cryptocurrencies with its creative method of tokenizing real-world assets ( RWAs ). By allowing the tokenization and transfer of intellectual property, commodities, and real estate, RXS is closing the digital and physical worlds. Those wishing to profit from the rising interest in distributed finance (DeFi) and blockchain-based asset management may find this unusual approach appealing as an investment. Rexas Finance Tokenomics Security and Community Engagement: RXS’s Winning Formula Rexas Finance doesn’t merely depend on creative concepts; it’s also establishing a robust base of security and openness, making it one of the new cryptocurrencies to buy in today’s dynamic market. The platform has been subject to a thorough security review by Certik, a top blockchain security company, which gives investors confidence in a landscape where digital risks and breaches are frequent worries. In addition to security, RXS is proactively involving its community with thrilling initiatives. It is currently offering a $1 million RXS token giveaway, in which 20 fortunate winners will each get $50,000 in tokens. With more than 1.46 million entries, this campaign has increased community engagement and awareness. Additionally, being listed on prominent cryptocurrency tracking platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko enhances RXS’s credibility and guarantees its performance is accessible to millions of prospective investors. Final Thoughts: A Cardano Price and RXS Create a Dual Opportunity for 2025 The cryptocurrency community is at cross roads as the year progresses. With its past history demonstrating rallying trends, and current price movements, Cardano price could be on the verge of a breakout. At the same time, Rexas Finance (RXS) is quickly gaining momentum through its creative asset tokenization approach, impressive presale results, and active community involvement. For investors, this dual chance presents an enticing story: while Cardano could spearhead a market surge similar to its 2020–2021 achievements, Rexas Finance provides an exhilarating option with the possibility of substantial profits. Both initiatives, with favorable market conditions, have the potential to yield significant returns, making the upcoming months of 2025 a time to monitor closely in the changing landscape of cryptocurrencies.

Texas has also advanced its own Bitcoin reserve bill (SB-21), which, if signed into law, will make it the first US state to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset. White House crypto czar David Sacks criticized past government Bitcoin sales, and argued that they cost taxpayers billions by failing to recognize Bitcoin’s long-term value. White House Establishes Strategic Bitcoin Reserve President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a US Digital Asset Stockpile, according to White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks. The reserve is designed to serve as a long-term store of value for Bitcoin, with initial funding coming from digital assets that were seized through criminal and civil asset forfeiture proceedings. Sacks described the initiative as a ”digital Fort Knox” for cryptocurrency, and said that the government will not sell any Bitcoin placed in the reserve. The executive order also created a separate digital asset stockpile, which will include non-Bitcoin digital assets held by the government. This initiative will ensure responsible stewardship of the government's digital assets under the Treasury Department. However, Sacks clarified that the government will not actively acquire additional digital assets beyond those that were obtained through forfeiture proceedings. Before the signing of the order, Bloomberg reported that the White House was expected to announce a Bitcoin reserve at the March 7 White House Crypto Summit. One of the proposed plans included using government-seized crypto as the initial seed for the reserve. Trump later confirmed on his Truth Social platform that the digital asset reserve will include major cryptocurrencies like XRP, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Ethereum (ETH), and Bitcoin (BTC), with ETH and BTC serving as its core assets. US Government crypto holdings (Source: Arkham Intelligence ) Data from Arkham Intelligence indicates that the US government currently holds close to $17.71 billion in seized digital assets, with 198,109 BTC making up the majority of these holdings at an estimated value of $17.87 billion. The government's second-largest crypto holding is Tether (USDT) worth around $122 million, which is followed by Ethereum (ETH) valued at over $119 million. However, Arkham’s data does not show any holdings of XRP, SOL, or ADA, despite Trump’s earlier statements regarding their inclusion in the reserve. In addition to creating the Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile, the executive order mandates a full audit of the federal government’s crypto holdings. According to Sacks, no comprehensive audit had ever been conducted before, making this a big step toward transparency in the government’s handling of digital assets. Texas Senate Approves Bitcoin Reserve Bill The Texas Senate also approved the Bitcoin strategic reserve bill SB-21 with a decisive 25-5 vote, which was a major step toward making Texas the first state in the US to hold a digital asset reserve. The bill was introduced by State Senator Charles Schwertner, and it aims to strengthen Texas' financial position by investing in Bitcoin, which he described as a valuable and scarce asset. During the Senate debate, Schwertner argued that Bitcoin serves as a hedge against inflation, and compared it to gold rather than a competitor to the US dollar. He placed a lot of emphasis on the fact that the continuous expansion of the money supply has devalued the dollar, making alternative assets like Bitcoin a lot more attractive. The bill still requires the governor’s signature to become law. If enacted, Texas will establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This move is part of the broader trend toward state-level adoption of digital assets. Initially, the bill focused only on Bitcoin, but in February, lawmakers revised the language to allow for the inclusion of other digital assets. This amendment was made after President Donald Trump’s executive order in January, which directed a commission to explore the feasibility of a federal digital asset stockpile. US States considering Bitcoin (Source: Bitcoin Laws ) The push for state-level Bitcoin reserves is gaining a lot of traction across the US . Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, who is a well-known advocate for Bitcoin, recently stated that states are likely to adopt Bitcoin reserves before the federal government due to fewer bureaucratic obstacles. At the Bitcoin Investor Week conference in New York, she pointed out that while her Bitcoin Act of 2024 has been introduced at the federal level, state initiatives like Texas’ SB-21 could move faster in setting a precedent for digital asset reserves. Crypto Czar Blasts US Bitcoin Sales White House crypto czar David Sacks also recently criticized the US government’s past sales of confiscated Bitcoin, and called it a strategic mistake that has cost taxpayers billions. In a social media post on March 6, Sacks revealed that the government generated $366 million from Bitcoin sales over the past decade, but if it held onto the assets, they would now be worth over $17 billion. He argued that the lack of a long-term strategy for Bitcoin has led to huge financial losses. The issue of treating Bitcoin as a short-term trade was also pointed out by Joe Burnett, who is head of market research at Unchained. He said that Bitcoin’s real value comes from long-term holding rather than trying to time the market. His comments echoed the growing concerns in the crypto community over the government’s approach to handling digital assets. In January, the Department of Justice received approval to sell 198,000 BTC seized from Silk Road, which was a decision that got widely criticized for not considering Bitcoin’s long-term potential. The debate over the government’s Bitcoin holdings intensified since Donald Trump’s election victory in November. Trump pledged to position the US as a leader in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, including establishing a strategic crypto reserve with Bitcoin playing a central role. His administration’s stance has led to renewed discussions on how the government should manage its digital assets. Sacks’ remarks came just before the White House’s first crypto summit , where more than 20 industry leaders were invited to discuss the country’s evolving digital asset policies. Some of the confirmed attendees include Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor, and Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. According to Sacks , the guest list was kept small to encourage a more focused discussion on digital asset strategies. There was growing speculation that the White House may announce plans for a strategic Bitcoin reserve during the summit on March 7. Unconfirmed reports also suggested that the administration is considering reducing or eliminating capital gains taxes on Bitcoin and other crypto holdings. While no official confirmation has been given, Sacks indicated that industry representatives will meet with President Trump’s Working Group on Digital Assets to shape future policies.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|ETH|ADA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-07 05:25:32

This major step in cryptocurrency policy is set to solidify the U.S.’s position in the growing digital asset space. Bitcoin Reserve Without Taxpayer Funds The executive order establishes a reserve for Bitcoin, which will be held exclusively in a digital stockpile. However, Trump’s plan does not rely on taxpayer funding. Instead, the reserve will be exclusively capitalized with Bitcoin that the federal government has confiscated through criminal and civil forfeiture cases. According to David Sacks, the White House crypto czar, this means no taxpayer dollars will be used to fund the reserve. “The reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings,” Sacks said. Digital Fort Knox: Long-Term Bitcoin Safeguarding Trump said that the reserve will act as a digital equivalent of Fort Knox, safeguarding the nation’s Bitcoin holdings for the long term. In his remarks, Sacks explained the importance of this reserve, stating that previous premature sales of Bitcoin by the U.S. government have resulted in over $17 billion in lost value. This new initiative aims to prevent such losses by establishing a strategic, long-term holding strategy. Expanding Beyond Bitcoin: U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile In addition to the Bitcoin reserve, the executive order also includes a broader U.S. digital asset stockpile, which will include other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, XRP, and Solana, all of which have been seized through forfeiture proceedings. However, the government will not seek to purchase more of these digital assets unless it can do so without additional cost to taxpayers. Global Impact: The U.S. Leads the Way This move marks a milestone not only for the U.S. but for the entire cryptocurrency market. With the federal government committing to hold Bitcoin as a store of value, the likelihood of Bitcoin being banned by the government has dramatically decreased. Additionally, this sets the stage for other countries to establish similar Bitcoin reserves, as global competition for Bitcoin intensifies. Strategic Reserve: Preserving and Maximizing Value The strategic reserve will not involve any immediate sales or purchases of Bitcoin, as it focuses on preserving and maximizing the value of assets already acquired by the government. The executive order also directs a full audit of the U.S. government’s existing digital asset holdings, with a focus on ensuring responsible stewardship under the Treasury Department. Industry Reactions and Future Outlook Industry insiders have reacted positively to the news, with many viewing this move as a precursor to future institutional and state-level adoption of Bitcoin. As this strategy unfolds, experts predict that other nations will closely monitor the U.S.’s approach and may follow suit in creating their own strategic Bitcoin reserves. The announcement comes just ahead of the White House Crypto Summit, where policymakers and industry leaders will discuss the future of digital assets and the regulatory framework surrounding them. With the U.S. leading the way in government-held Bitcoin reserves, the global crypto landscape is poised for a major transformation.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-07 05:26:08

Ripple has partnered with Ondo Finance to introduce tokenized U.S. Treasuries to the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This initiative is poised to redefine how institutional investors engage with one of the safest asset classes in the world. By leveraging the capabilities of the XRPL, this collaboration aims to enhance efficiency, security, and transparency in capital markets. Ripple partnered with Ondo Finance to bring tokenized U.S. Treasuries to the #XRP Ledger. But why should you care? 1/11 — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) March 4, 2025 The Importance of Tokenizing U.S. Treasuries U.S. Treasuries are considered one of the most secure investment vehicles globally. Traditionally, access to these assets is constrained by operational inefficiencies, including settlement delays and limited market hours. As Claver notes, the partnership between Ripple and Ondo Finance seeks to “take one of the safest investments in the world—U.S. Treasuries—and make them available 24/7 with instant settlement.” This transition to blockchain technology allows investors to access U.S. Treasuries at any time, improving liquidity and reducing counterparty risk. Ondo Finance’s OUSG fund, which is already integrated with Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana, is backed by BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund. Claver highlights that OUSG currently offers a 4.16% yield with $184 million locked. The decision to integrate with the XRPL further broadens the accessibility of tokenized treasuries, positioning the ledger as a preferred infrastructure for institutional finance. The Institutional Appeal of the XRP Ledger For institutional investors, three key factors determine blockchain adoption: security, compliance, and efficiency. Claver emphasizes that “the XRP Ledger offers all three with built-in features like Decentralized Identifiers and onchain credential management.” These capabilities provide a strong foundation for regulated financial instruments and reinforce trust in the XRPL as a viable platform for large-scale institutional adoption. Compared to other blockchain networks, the XRPL offers advantages in speed and cost. Claver points out that “when institutions compare blockchain speed and cost, XRPL offers advantages that matter at scale.” This efficiency can prove critical in attracting institutional participants who seek to optimize their financial operations. The XRPL’s built-in decentralized exchange (DEX), automated market maker (AMM) , price oracles, and forthcoming lending protocol further enhance its appeal as a comprehensive financial ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Broader Implications for Capital Markets The integration of tokenized assets into the XRPL sets the stage for a broader transformation of capital markets. Claver asks, “What if entire capital markets moved to blockchain? Settlements in seconds instead of days. 24/7 trading. Lower costs. Greater transparency.” These advantages align with the digital transformation of financial services, potentially reshaping how assets are issued, traded, and settled. Katie Wheeler, VP of Partnerships at Ondo Finance, underscores the significance of this collaboration, stating, “Ondo is proud to bring OUSG to the XRPL, a blockchain that institutions already know and trust.” Trust remains a critical component in financial markets, and the XRPL’s track record of reliability enhances its attractiveness to institutional stakeholders. Future Prospects and Conclusion Claver presents three possible outcomes for this initiative: failure, niche adoption, or widespread transformation. He asks the audience, “Which would you bet on?” While the future remains uncertain, the initiative to catalyze a wholesale transformation of financial markets is significant. The partnership between Ripple and Ondo Finance represents more than just the tokenization of U.S. Treasuries. It signals a shift toward more efficient, transparent, and accessible financial markets. As institutional adoption of blockchain technology grows, the XRPL’s role in the evolution of capital markets will become increasingly prominent. This transformation is already underway, making it imperative for investors and financial professionals to notice.

Whales Buy 150 Million DOGE appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Dogecoin (DOGE), the world’s largest and most popular meme coin, is catching the attention of crypto whales and investors due to its attractive price range. Data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment shows that crypto whales have purchased a significant 150 million DOGE in the past three days. Crypto Whales Buy 150 Million DOGE This substantial purchase occurred while DOGE was consolidating near a crucial support level of $0.185. Additionally, it indicates that whales and investors are capitalizing on the current market sentiment and bearish price action to accumulate the token, despite concerns about further price declines. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1897700957103837293 Current Price Momentum DOGE is currently trading at $0.19 and has experienced a price drop of over 8% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume surged by 50%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors and reflecting the community’s bullish outlook. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, DOGE is consolidating within a tight range and is currently at a crucial support level of $0.185. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if it breaks out of consolidation and closes a daily candle above $0.21, there is a strong possibility that the meme coin could surge by 20% to reach $0.25 in the coming days. Source: Trading View Additionally, DOGE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is near 35, indicating weak momentum, which could be a key factor behind the meme coin’s ongoing struggle. $43 Million Worth of DOGE Outflow Another factor gaining attention among crypto enthusiasts is the ongoing outflow of DOGE tokens from exchanges. Data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass reveals that exchanges have witnessed consistent outflows since the beginning of February 2025, suggesting potential accumulation by long-term holders and investors. Source: Coinglass Additionally, the data shows that exchanges have seen $43 million worth of DOGE outflows in the past 48 hours, indicating further accumulation, which could support the meme coin’s recovery soon.

He argued that Trump wants to create the reserve using the Bitcoin the government already owns, but the executive order doesn’t authorize the buying of any more Bitcoin. Schiff later clarified that the executive order did authorize acquiring more Bitcoin so long as it could be done at zero cost. The White House revealed that “The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce were authorized to develop budget-friendly strategies for acquiring additional BTC.” He also suggested that it meant that “if they seize any more Bitcoin they can keep that too.” The economist maintained that the executive order doesn’t allow the government to buy more digital assets, as buying by definition required a payment. Peter Schiff believes Trump was under pressure to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Under pressure from his donors and conflicted cabinet members, Trump just signed a bogus executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve using the Bitcoin the government already owns. But the executive order doesn't authorize the buying of any more Bitcoin. Look out below! — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) March 7, 2025 Peter Schiff, Chief Economist and Global Strategist at Euro Pacific Capital has disclosed that the President was under pressure from his donors and conflicted cabinet members to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. He called Trump’s executive order to create a reserve “bogus” since the government wanted to use the BTC it already owned. The economist also noted that the executive order allowed the government to acquire more BTC so long as they can do so without any costs. The order authorizes the state to get more digital assets without buying and Schiff jokingly mentioned that the government can keep all the Bitcoin they seize. Crypto enthusiast Ryan Park argued that the order doesn’t authorize the buying of other virtual currencies for the “other stockpile.” He believes that the executive order doesn’t allow the selling of gold and buying of Bitcoin from “I dunno Fort Knox stockpile,” which should not be confused with the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Park acknowledged that Bessent and Lutnick had also been authorized to explore ways of acquiring more BTC without costing the taxpayer. The tech enthusiast maintained that selling gold and purchasing digital assets from the Fort Knox stockpile does not cost the taxpayer a dime. Euro Pacific Capital’s global strategist argued that selling gold and purchasing BTC do cost money, and the cost of the digital asset is the gold sold to pay for it. Schiff said that paying for Bitcoin for gold was the same as paying cash. Park dismissed Schiff’s claims and said that selling gold for Bitcoin involved opportunity costs and “NOT direct taxpayer funds.” He also suggested that the government’s gold could be stabilized by Bitcoin’s growing adoption but not replaced by it. Park argued that BTC’s value could bolster gold’s role and reduce market volatility, unlike debt reduction, which offered fiscal stability. He added that the government favoring Bitcoin over other assets reflected belief in the potential of the virtual asset “to complement, not supplant, gold.” Schiff says Trump is preventing the market from collapsing Peter Schiff argued that Trump was the only thing that could delay a Bitcoin drop because the support of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could push prices higher. He also stated that the entire crypto market would collapse without Trump forcing U.S. taxpayers to buy BTC and other worthless crypto tokens. “I think the only thing that can delay a Bitcoin meltdown is Trump. He has to indicate strong support for a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, funded by large purchases of Bitcoin. Basically, the equivalent of QE, only with the government buying Bitcoin instead of bonds. It’s not likely.” – Peter Schiff , Chief Economist and Global Strategist at Euro Pacific Capital. The economist argued that a government-backed crypto reserve would ultimately be counterproductive. The crypto skeptic also warned that once the buying halted, the market would likely resume its decline. He also noted that the government could trigger a massive crypto crash if it ever decided to liquidate its holdings. The President signed the executive order on March 7 to establish a government reserve of BTC. Crypto Czar David Sacks revealed the government will retain the estimated 200,000 Bitcoin already seized in criminal and civil proceedings.

Solana continues to assert its presence, maintaining strong decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes despite a downturn in meme coin trading, while also attracting new projects like PAWS, a SocialFi Telegram Mini App that migrated from The Open Network (TON) due to policy changes. Solana’s DEX Volumes Hold Strong Despite Meme Coin Turmoil, Says VanEck Solana’s decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes continue to rival those of the entire Ethereum ecosystem, even after a sharp decline in meme coin trading activity, according to asset manager VanEck. While the Solana blockchain recently faced a slowdown due to meme coin-related controversies, its overall market presence remains robust. VanEck’s March 5 report highlighted that in February, Solana’s share of total on-chain DEX volume surged to over 43%, briefly surpassing the combined DEX volume of Ethereum and its layer-2 scaling solutions. However, this dominance has slightly receded, with Solana’s market share dropping to around 30% in March, while Ethereum’s ecosystem now commands roughly 40% of the market. Despite the decline, VanEck’s head of research, Matthew Sigel, emphasized that Solana’s DEX volumes remain competitive. “Despite the Meme coin Meltdown, Solana DEX volumes are still holding their own — roughly matching the entire ETH ecosystem (L1 + L2s),” he posted on X. Solana’s trading activity took a hit following a series of high-profile meme coin-related scandals that shook investor confidence. VanEck’s report noted that stablecoin transfers—an essential component of on-chain trading—dropped by 80% from January levels. One of the most significant incidents occurred on Feb. 14 when the meme coin Libra, which was seemingly endorsed by Argentine President Javier Milei, saw its market capitalization wiped out by $4.4 billion within hours of launching. Similarly, traders lost approximately $2 billion across 800,000 wallets due to the highly publicized Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin, tied to US President Donald Trump. Meme coin trading, primarily linked to Solana’s Pump.fun platform, has been a major revenue driver for the blockchain, accounting for around 80% of its network revenue. However, activity has slowed dramatically, with new token launches on Pump.fun declining by over 80% since January. Raydium’s Resilience Amidst the Downturn While the meme coin sector has struggled, Solana’s DeFi ecosystem remains resilient. Raydium, the blockchain’s most popular DEX, still boasts a total value locked (TVL) of over $1.3 billion, according to DefiLlama data as of March 6. VanEck’s report shows that Solana has been a standout performer in the current crypto market cycle. In 2024 alone, its token price has surged by 191%, on-chain revenues (excluding MEV) have skyrocketed by 700%, and stablecoin supply has expanded by 291%. “One of the biggest drivers of Solana’s growth has been meme coin trading,” VanEck noted, adding that Pump.fun generated over $577 million in fees in just over a year. While the recent downturn in meme coin trading has impacted Solana’s overall activity, the blockchain’s ability to maintain a significant share of DEX volumes indicates strong underlying demand. As the ecosystem continues to evolve, Solana’s performance in the broader DeFi landscape will be a key factor in determining its long-term success. With continued institutional interest and the potential for new innovations within the Solana DeFi space, the blockchain remains well-positioned for further growth despite short-term turbulence in the meme coin sector. PAWS Migrates to Solana in Response to Telegram’s Policy Shift In a decisive move against restrictive policies, PAWS, a widely popular Telegram Mini App, has migrated to the Solana blockchain after Telegram mandated that all Mini Apps and third-party crypto wallets exclusively operate on The Open Network (TON). The policy change forced many projects to either comply or leave Telegram’s ecosystem, igniting discussions on decentralization and the future of multichain development. PAWS, a SocialFi project that rewards users for engagement, chose not to be confined to a single ecosystem and instead embraced Solana’s thriving blockchain infrastructure. The transition of PAWS and its massive 80-million-strong user base to Solana significantly bolstered the network’s adoption. Since the migration, over 9 million Phantom crypto wallets have been downloaded, and more than 1 million new Solana addresses have been funded, all before PAWS’ token generation event (TGE). This surge in activity demonstrates Solana’s capacity to support large-scale projects and onboard mainstream users into the ecosystem. The migration also showed Solana’s appeal as an alternative to Telegram’s TON, proving that projects can thrive outside of walled gardens. Additionally, PAWS’ NFT vouchers gained immense traction on the Solana-based NFT marketplace Magic Eden, triggering over 100,000 transactions in just two weeks. The ability of PAWS’ community to seamlessly transition to a new blockchain highlights the importance of a strong product and engaged user base over rigid platform dependencies. The PAWS migration has rekindled a long-standing debate in crypto: value extraction versus value injection. Many blockchain initiatives generate short-lived liquidity influxes through speculative token trading, often leading to capital flight once interest wanes. This pattern has been especially evident in Solana’s ecosystem, where high-volatility meme coins and recent rug pulls have caused significant market turbulence. PAWS, however, is challenging this trend by emphasizing sustained user participation rather than speculation-driven growth. By focusing on long-term engagement and community-driven incentives, PAWS is fostering a more stable and enduring ecosystem. This shift aligns with Solana’s broader push to attract projects that prioritize sustainable development over short-term financial gains. Transforming PAWS into a Web3 Brand Beyond its blockchain migration, PAWS is undergoing a rebranding initiative to establish itself as a long-lasting intellectual property in the Web3 space. The project aims to evolve from a viral Telegram Mini App into a comprehensive Web3 brand with multiple revenue streams and strong community involvement. Key aspects of this transformation include: DeFi Integrations: Incorporating decentralized finance functionalities to enhance utility and reward active participants. Gaming Partnerships: Expanding into blockchain gaming to attract a broader user base. Social Engagement Tools: Introducing innovative features to maintain high levels of community interaction. Multichain Expansion: While PAWS has committed to Solana, future plans include extending its reach to Ethereum, layer-2 networks, and other ecosystems. In addition to its blockchain ambitions, PAWS seeks to establish itself as a recognizable mainstream brand. Real-world activations, strategic collaborations, and increased media presence are all part of its roadmap. Central to this vision is a sustainable token economy, ensuring that community members and token holders play an active role in governance and ecosystem growth. The shift from a widely used Mini App to a robust Web3 brand positions PAWS as a potential case study for how meme culture and viral engagement can be leveraged into a sustainable business model. Its transition also raises a critical question: can Telegram’s retail-heavy user base transition into permissionless blockchain ecosystems? If PAWS’ migration proves successful, it may serve as a blueprint for future Web3 projects seeking to break free from centralized platforms and establish themselves in decentralized environments. By demonstrating that a project can maintain and even grow its user base post-migration, PAWS is setting a precedent for how Web3 applications can thrive beyond the constraints of proprietary ecosystems. As the blockchain industry continues to evolve, PAWS’ journey will be closely watched. Whether its move to Solana marks the beginning of a larger trend remains to be seen, but its decision to prioritize decentralization over convenience is already making waves in the Web3 landscape.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-07 05:30:00

Its price shed 31% of its previous gains in the last month as its volatile crypto market cap slumped below $3 billion. However, as the crypto market descends into turmoil, Rollblock’s RBLK is outperforming the meme coin f renzy with a meteoric surge of 500% since the start of its ongoing presale. Currently priced at $0.06, RBLK is the utility token powering Rollblock’s emerging GambleFi protocol. Here is why you need to pay attention to this meme coin killer. PEPE coin’s wild price wings reflect meme coin fatigue The speculative meme coin frenzy has somewhat died down after endless waves of newly minted coins launched on Solana’s network, leading to unprecedented network congestion. However, after the recent Bitcoin price dip and a ByBit hack of $1.5 billio n in ETH, investors are growing risk-averse across the board, and the meme coin market is no exception. PEPE coin , once a giant in the meme coin space, has seen its market capitalization dip below $3 billion after peaking past $10 billion at the tail end of 2024. PEPE coin is now down 31%, in the last 30 days and a recent transfer of 170 billion PEPE to Binance has caused speculators to forecast further selling pressure. If selling momentum continues, PEPE may struggle to reclaim key resistance levels in the short term. (Image source: Coingecko) Meme coin hype struggles amid crypto market dip The recent market-wide pullback is not only a PEPE coin problem; Bitcoin’s dip below $80K sent a shockwave across the entire crypto market, it has since retraced back to 90k . Meme coins took the biggest hit, as seen by PEPE coin’s 75% dip from its peak price of 3 months ago. According to a market analyst on YouTube named Satoshi Stacker, there is an ongoing move by some whales to manipulate the crypto market. Even so, there is still a glimmer of hope for a resurgence, given the move by the U.S. Federal Reserve to maintain interest rates. This outlook has seen some market watchers anticipate a rebound for the crypto market , with some forecasting bullish price predictions for the PEPE coin. Rollblock’s RBLK defies the crypto market downturn with a 500% surge As the crypto market’s volatile swings continue and with PEPE coin’s struggle, Rollblock’s RBLK has shown remarkable resilience, with a notable uptick of 500% since the start of its ongoing presale.

White House crypto and AI czar David Sacks said on X that the stockpile will also include other coins forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings while stressing that no taxpayer money will spent on acquiring BTC or other coins. According to Arkham Intelligence, the U.S. government currently holds 198,000 bitcoins worth about $17.3 billion. Treating the same as reserve essentially takes out over $17 billion in selling pressure from the market. Still, bitcoin extended losses, hitting lows near $84,700, reflecting investor disappointment over the lack of new BTC purchases for the U.S. government. Prices, however, have recovered to $87,600 at press time in hopes that Trump will announce a favorable crypto tax policy at Friday's White House crypto summit. Here is what market pundits had to say about the strategic reserve. Valentin Fournier, analyst at BRN ""The Executive Order has disappointed some investors, as it explicitly states that the government will not acquire additional assets beyond those obtained through forfeitures. This lack of a clear acquisition plan has created confusion, weighing on market sentiment and leading to a 4% daily decline in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana."" ""Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has been authorized to develop a budget-neutral strategy for acquiring additional Bitcoin. Given Lutnick's strong ties to Bitcoin through his involvement with MicroStrategy, this could signal a hidden accumulation strategy by the U.S. government, potentially igniting a parabolic rally."" Dick Lo, CEO of Quant-driven digital assets trading firm TDX Strategies ""Initial disappointment as the market had built up high expectations leading up to the announcement. However, the news is unambiguous positive: It would have been unrealistic to expect new buying without a plan on how it would be funded; An important distinction has been made between Bitcoin and the rest of crypto, i.e. not a single dollar will be spent buying altcoins."" ""Potential further positive announcements to come from the Crypto Summit: more favorable tax treatment towards crypto."" Andrew O’Neill, Digital Assets Managing Director, S&P Global Ratings “The significance of this executive order is mainly symbolic, as it marks the first time bitcoin is formally recognized as a reserve asset of the United States government. Currently, the reserve will only include bitcoin already owned by the U.S. government, specifically BTC forfeited through criminal or civil procedures. The order commits to holding this BTC as a reserve asset without selling it. ""However, the order does contemplate the possibility of acquiring additional bitcoin for the reserve, provided it can be done in a budget-neutral manner.There is no indication yet of how much, if any, would be acquired nor a timeline. The order also clearly distinguishes between bitcoin and other digital assets, which will not be included in the reserve but rather, included in a separate ""stockpile."" Jeff Anderson, head of Asia at STS Digital, said in a Telegram message: ""Market is re-pricing tail risk now that the U.S. won't be actively buying BTC. The BVIV [the 30-day implied volatility index] is down 6 vol points this morning.""This is a running list of comments from crypto market experts and will be updated regularly.",Markets|Bitcoin|Trump|Bitcoin Strategic Reserve,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-07 05:31:43

The report shows that Solana’s trading activity briefly surpassed that of the Ethereum ecosystem, including its Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) networks. Solana Maintains High Trading Activity VanEck’s analysts revealed that the price of Solana (SOL) increased by 191% in 2024, while its on-chain revenues grew by 700%. The blockchain’s low transaction fees, averaging $0.05 compared to Ethereum’s $1.27, have contributed to its ability to handle high trade volumes efficiently. Meme coin trading has added majorly to Solana’s revenue, accounting for approximately 80%. Pump.fun, the network’s meme coin maker, has also collected over $577 million in fees within a year. However, the market has been affected by concerns about insider trading and automated bots purchasing tokens before retail investors, with the LIBRA coin controversy an example of this. Launched in February, the coin got mired in allegations of insider trading and market manipulation when its value quickly collapsed, leaving investors reeling from millions worth of losses . In that same month, a collapse in meme coin trading led to an 80% drop in Solana’s stablecoin transfers from its January levels. Other trading metrics also declined, with DEX volumes falling by 55%, fees collected dropping by 63%, and MEV activity decreasing by 63%. Despite these setbacks, the network’s overall trading volumes remained competitive with Ethereum’s entire ecosystem. Further, the blockchain is set to undergo multiple protocol upgrades, which are expected to enhance its performance. Ethereum’s Decline and Potential Solutions Ethereum has also seen a decline in revenue and overall usage. Over the past year, gas prices have fallen 88%, and its revenue has dropped 93%. The network’s share of total blockchain revenue decreased from 55% in February 2024 to 24% in February 2025. According to Matthew Siegel and Patrick Bush from VanEck, Ethereum’s strategy of encouraging users to move to L2 solutions has reduced activity on its Mainnet. As a result, major projects such as Uniswap and Ondo have begun expanding beyond the network. Meanwhile, its transaction throughput remains lower than competing blockchains, with a recorded maximum of 63 transactions per second (TPS) compared to Solana’s 4,000 TPS. To address these challenges, validators increased gas limits by 20% in February, raising transaction capacity from 30 million to 36 million gas units. The upcoming Pectra upgrade , set for this month, includes changes to L2 blob capacity, validator stake limits, and staking processes. Additionally, the Ethereum Foundation has introduced Intents, a software update aimed at improving transaction efficiency across Layer 2 networks.

But as these crypto giants fall, a new contender, DTX Exchange is on the rise to the top. While SHIB and Dogecoin are facing sell-off pressure, DTX will list at $0.36, doubling the return on investment for early buyers of the token today at $0.18. Early buyers get 2x their tokens when DTX launches. With 700,000+ holders already on board, this last presale phase is making headlines already as investors hunt for the next big thing. Dogecoin Price Crash Causes Investor Panic The DOGE price is crashing, losing over 5% in the last 7 days. Though US crypto reserves are holding firm, DOGE price is under selling pressure and investors are beginning to sell off. With the DOGE price going down, some investors have lost hope and are looking for an alternative with high potential. As DOGE price keeps lagging, investors are looking elsewhere to DTX Exchange, a 200% DeFi altcoin that is real and viable. Unlike Dogecoin, which is based on hype, DTX is real; it integrates crypto, stocks, and forex into one trading platform. The upcoming $0.36 listing promises early buyers at $0.18 with a 2x profit when DTX launches, and LIST2X offer doubles their stake with a 4x profit before trading goes live. SHIB Price Crashes as Investors Lose Faith Shiba Inu is crashing hard, losing almost 9% over the past 7 days, and market sentiment remains bearish. Despite the bullish US crypto reserve, SHIB price keeps going down, and investors keep selling their SHIB tokens. Source: CoinMarketCap With the large number of the investors being disinterested in SHIB, they shift to a better opportunity that holds real upside. As the price of SHIB keeps plummeting, DTX Exchange has attracted investors toward it, boasting 200% potential as a DeFi altcoin. While SHIB continues to fall because of market risks, DTX proves itself as a top-notch blockchain. DTX Exchange stands out because of its 200,000+ TPS speed, making it one of the fastest trading projects in the crypto space. DTX Exchange’s 2X Listing; The Best Opportunity Right Now DTX Exchange is giving early buyers an unmatched advantage, a 2x guarantee before trading begins. Investors buying now at $0.18 will have their investment doubled in value when DTX is traded on the exchange at $0.36. And that’s not all, with the LIST2X promo, buyers get a 100% bonus on their purchase, which means their tokens are 4x. For investors that look for huge returns with absolutely no chance for fluctuation within the market, DTX isn’t an investment that should be overlooked. DTX holders are also given important benefits like lower fees, staking rewards, and voting rights. That makes DTX more than speculation; it’s an asset with real use. Security is a huge issue in crypto, but DTX Exchange solves this problem with a non-custodial model, so traders maintain full control of their funds. DTX Exchange also offers on-chain order books, and it offers open trades. Token holders with big holdings are given a rebate program by DTX Exchange, which benefits them with profit share. As Dogecoin keeps going through market volatility, DOGE price keeps falling lower, and SHIB is also not doing better even with high US crypto reserves, investors now look towards DTX Exchange for improved potential yields.

This achievement shows growing investor confidence in Solaxy’s mission to enhance Solana’s scalability and efficiency. The window to buy SOLX tokens at discounted prices will close as the presale progresses. This presents a timely opportunity for early adopters who can also stake their tokens and increase their holdings while the presale lasts. Addressing Solana’s Challenges Solana has been the most popular blockchain for DeFi and meme coin trading thanks to its high transaction speeds and low fees, which made it a formidable Layer-1 blockchain. However, its rapid adoption has led to challenges such as network congestion and occasional transaction failures, particularly during periods of heightened activity. With thousands of meme coins launched daily on Solana, where even US President Donald Trump decided to launch his OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP) meme coin, the congestion issue will persist for a while. But there is a solution. Solaxy aims to mitigate these issues by introducing a Layer-2 blockchain that processes transactions off-chain, bundling them into one transaction before sending them for settlement on mainnet. This will alleviate the load on Solana’s mainnet, making it usable even during peak congestion. DEV UPDATE 3: SP1 zkVM Proofs: Validating the Future We've successfully integrated: • SVM inside zkVM • SP1 + Sovereign rollup framework • We are collaborating with @Sovereign_Labs to refine the optimistic mode of the rollup & finalize security measures. Data… — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) February 2, 2025 According to the latest dev update , the Solaxy team has made significant progress this week, focusing on enhancing user accessibility and network efficiency. Collaborations with major wallet providers are underway to simplify interactions with Solaxy, ensuring that non-technical users can seamlessly navigate the ecosystem. Additionally, discussions are ongoing with key platforms to expand token launchpad capabilities, making it easier to deploy projects on Solaxy. These efforts aim to strengthen the network’s usability and attract more participants. Infrastructure optimizations have been a priority on the technical front, leading to reduced latency, higher transaction throughput, and lower user fees. Enhancements in on-chain data storage on Solana L1 are also being implemented to minimize costs and maximize efficiency. A dedicated bridge UI using Hyperlane’s repository has begun. This feature will enable smooth cross-chain transfers between Solana, Ethereum, Base, and Solaxy. Once finalized, it will be accessible via Hyperlane’s official interface, further solidifying Solaxy’s multi-chain capabilities. SOLX Token Powers the Ecosystem The SOLX token is at the heart of Solaxy’s ecosystem. Its distinguishing feature is its multi-chain compatibility. By operating seamlessly across Solana and Ethereum networks, it allows users to leverage Ethereum’s extensive liquidity while benefiting from Solana’s swift transaction capabilities. The ongoing SOLX presale is structured to reward early participants with the most favorable pricing, where token prices will incrementally increase as funding milestones are achieved. That said, investors can buy SOLX now for $0.001654 apiece. Note that the price will go up in less than 10 hours, making it prudent to buy early. In addition, presale participants can stake their SOLX holdings immediately for a dynamic yield of 163%. Being dynamic means it drops as more tokens are staked. As a result, early stakers will benefit the most. This could be why popular crypto YouTubers like Danjo Capital Master praise SOLX and believe this could be the best meme coin to buy in 2025. SOLAXY PART 2 – BEST MEME COIN IN 2025? Solaxy’s Future is Here – Get Involved Today! Solaxy’s successful presale and innovative approach to scaling Solana’s capabilities make it a noteworthy project in the blockchain space. As the presale progresses, interested investors can take advantage of the current pricing and staking benefits while they last. With its focus on addressing existing blockchain challenges and fostering interoperability between major networks, Solaxy is poised to impact the landscape of Layer-2 blockchains. Investors can participate via the official Solaxy presale website, with payment options including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Tether (USDT), and Credit Cards. Additionally, the Best Wallet app , accessible on both Google Play and Apple App Store , offers a convenient way to purchase and manage SOLX tokens.

In its third presale stage, The FX Guys raised more than $4 million, and each $FXG token now costs about $0.05. Many believe that FXGuys will outdo projects such as Polkadot and become one of the top DeFi coins. FXGuys Presale Surges—A Potential Game Changer in the Prop Trading Space While many promising altcoins fail to attract notice, FXGuys stands apart by combining prop trading with blockchain tech. Its Trade2Earn system grants traders $FXG tokens , which motivates traders to trade more and builds a self-reliant network. Compared to traditional prop trading firms that demand high initial costs and strict rules, FX Guys provides an easy prop trading funding program that lets traders get up to $500,000 in capital with an 80/20 profit split in the trader’s favor. By removing fees on buying and selling and running a decentralized trading system without identity checks, The FX Guys makes it easier for traders worldwide to join. With a focus on quick deals, users can send and receive money in regular or crypto form on the same day, and the service accepts over 100 local currencies. This ease makes FXGuys a welcome choice even next to top proprietary trading firms, drawing the attention of traders who look for freedom and quick profit. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Staking $FXG—A Passive Income Opportunity Like No Other In addition to its prop trading benefits, FXGuys offers a new staking option. Instead of using standard staking sites, FXGuys lets users deposit $FXG plus earn a 20% share of profits and revenue from broker trades. This method makes $FXG work as a useful token moreover a steady income source, which differs from many top DeFi coins that count only on rising prices. The FXGuys network gives traders many trading tools. Depending on where they live, traders pick from platforms such as FXGuys Trader, MT5, Match-Trader, cTrader or DXtrade. With this layout, FXGuys builds its role as a smart prop trader setup for common and professional traders alike. Could FXGuys Surpass Polkadot in the DeFi Race? Polkadot has been seen as a top choice for connecting different blockchains and helping them grow. As new competitors appear and market needs change, plans that provide clear money gains win more support. FXGuys makes a strong case to lead the market plus gives traders and buyers several ways to earn money through staking, trade-to-earn, and a funding plan for proprietary trading. While Polkadot works on connecting chains, FX Guys changes financial trading by linking traditional prop firms with decentralized finance. Users gain $FXG through trades without any buy or sell tax and receive funds instantly, which makes FX Guys an appealing option to traders and DeFi fans. Polkadot’s importance in the market might be tested if growth continues at this rate. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Final Thoughts With a new presale stage that broke records and more than $4 million raised so far, FXGuys shows itself as one altcoin with great promise. Its new staking plan, quick funding business setup, and no kyc trading system make it a turning point in the top space of decentralized finance tokens.

Below is an overview of five tokens poised for potential growth.​ Each project offers something unique – a high-risk, high-reward approach tied to Bitcoin’s trajectory, an innovative Layer-2 solution for Solana, or a bridge between traditional finance and DeFi. We explore each token, breaking down its features and explaining why it might be the next big opportunity for early investors. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) With the recent announcement of a US Strategic Crypto Reserve, the BTC Bull Token could be the main beneficiary. This meme-based cryptocurrency is designed to capitalize on Bitcoin’s projected ascent to $1 million. By holding BTCBULL, investors can earn BTC and BTCBULL tokens as Bitcoin reaches specific price milestones, such as $150k, $200k, and $250k. The token’s structure also includes token burn mechanics when BTC trades at $125k, $175k, and $225k. The goal is to reduce the token supply by 15% and potentially increase the token’s value. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, BTCBULL ensures global accessibility and compatibility with various Ethereum wallets, simplifying trading and staking processes. Thanks to its partnership with Best Wallet , users can buy BTCBULL with a card and receive BTC airdrops in the same wallet account. While the presale lasts, early investors can earn even more BTCBULL tokens via staking. With a dynamic APY of 132%, this could be an excellent opportunity to increase holdings without making new purchases. Visit BTC Bull Token Solaxy (SOLX) As Solana slowly became the leading blockchain for decentralized finance and meme coin trading, issues like failed transactions during network congestion became apparent. Solaxy offers a Layer-2 solution for the Solana blockchain to address these issues, aiming to improve the blockchain for everyday users. The way it works is that Solaxy bundles multiple transactions into one and sends them for settlement on Solana. This means no failed transactions, even at peak congestion, and meme coin trading can continue with ease. SOLAXY PART 2 – BEST MEME COIN IN 2025? The native token, SOLX, operates across the Ethereum and Solana networks, bridging liquidity and efficiency between these ecosystems. Investors can buy the token with ETH and SOL during the presale. The ongoing SOLX presale offers early investors access to tokens at a discounted price of $0.001654. Staking options are available during this phase to reward early supporters. Solaxy’s innovative approach could make it a significant player in the blockchain space, especially for those looking to leverage Solana’s capabilities without its current limitations. Visit Solaxy Jupiter (JUP) When newcomers want to swap tokens on Solana, they will likely stumble on Jupiter. What started as a simple aggregator that brought users the best prices from decentralized exchanges and liquidity pools has become a leading exchange with multiple utilities. Users can swap tokens, set limit or recurring orders, or use Jupiter’s perpetual futures to trade SOL, ETH, and BTC with leverage in a fully decentralized way. Moreover, a so-called “Trenches” platform was launched by Jupiter to help meme coin traders find the best meme coins in real time. The JUP token is a governance token that gives voting rights to holders who stake it. Voting is incentivized with more JUP tokens and other tokens from projects that use the Jupiter launchpad. Popular Solana projects like Zeus, deBridge, Sanctum, and many more have used the launch pad in the past. Even OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP) used Jupiter’s infrastructure to launch the token. With ambitious plans for the future, such as the Giant Unifit Market (GUM) initiative, where everything will be tokenized and traded in one spot, and the JupNet, an omnichannel network that will aggregate all crypto in one decentralized ledger, the future for JUP holders looks bright. Ondo Finance (ONDO) Ondo Finance continues to bridge traditional finance with decentralized finance by offering tokenized real-world assets, such as US Treasuries. Further strengthening its infrastructure, Ondo Finance introduced the Ondo Chain, a Layer-1 blockchain specifically built to support tokenized real-world assets. This development addresses challenges RWAs face, such as compatibility issues with decentralized finance platforms and inadequate safety on existing networks, thereby expanding the project’s potential use cases. Ondo Finance also launched Ondo Global Markets (Ondo GM), a blockchain-based platform designed to bring traditional financial assets like equities, bonds, and ETFs on the blockchain, enhancing accessibility and efficiency. The ONDO token functions as the governance token within the Ondo decentralized autonomous organization. It grants holders rights related to the platform’s protocols, including Flux Finance. Best Wallet Token (BEST) With thousands of new tokens emerging daily on various blockchains, crypto investors often find it a hassle to store them all in one place. Best Wallet and its BEST token solve this by offering a multi-chain, non-custodial way to store coins and tokens. This is the fastest-growing crypto wallet, aiming to capture a substantial market share by 2026. That could happen, given that the platform offers features like fiat onramp and offramp, integrated multi-chain DEX, and access to new and vetted presales. BestWallet Is The Best Crypto Wallet And Hottest Crypto Launchpad Of 2025! To further improve users’ experience, the BEST token, which is now sold at a discount during its presale, offers reduced transaction fees, early access to new projects at Stage 0, higher staking rewards via Best Wallet’s staking aggregator, and governance rights for token holders. Early investors benefit from staking rewards during the presale, which has a dynamic yield of 147%. With over $10 million raised so far, Best Wallet Token is proving very popular among crypto investors.",Press Release,EN,0,0,ONDO|TRADING|BTC|SOL|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-07 06:15:27
41270465,https://nulltx.com/?p=146700,1741332127,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Binance Sees Massive Inflows Following Bybit Hack as CZ Reflects on Ethereum Miss,https://nulltx.com/binance-sees-massive-inflows-following-bybit-hack-as-cz-reflects-on-ethereum-miss/,"The world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance , has experienced a net inflow surge lately. Between February 21 and February 27, 2025, however, Binance made out much better than any other exchange. It attracted an astonishing total of $3.971 billion in net inflows during that brief period. For context, nine other major exchanges drew in together only $396.83 million for the same period (they raised half a billion altogether, but Binance snared a steep chunk of that almost all to itself). So, we can see pretty clearly that Binance is going up amidst a broadly declining situation where investors are moving away from centralized exchanges. Binance Dominates in February 2025, Outpacing Competitors The data from February 2025 really emphasizes the fact that Binance is clearly the leader in this market. During that month, Binance’s net inflow was of $5.323 billion. The other nine exchanges combined had a net inflow of $1.229 billion, which made their monthly net inflow 4.33 times smaller than Binance’s. This was a gap that could hardly be seen on the second place exchange, Bitfinex, which had a net inflow of $768.19 million. Capital pouring into Binance coincides with the latest market trend. Data from DefiLlama shows that for the last many months in a row, Binance has been racking up net inflows of well over $3 billion a month. In the month of November alone, Binance hit its peak with a net inflow of I can’t say the exact amount in my own words, but it was definitely well north of $9 billion. The latest inflows were sort of a back-to-back after Binance also saw the inflows after the Bybit hack at the last part of October, which seems the inflows in general and also seems like a sign of GUD trust and a sign of confidence because even in times of market turbulence, we still see traders and investors placing their funds into Binance. The picture that the data paints is one of Binance’s overwhelming market share, particularly in contrast to its competitors. Exchanges that are seen to be in direct competition with Binance on a regular basis seem to have experienced nowhere near the level of inflows that Binance has. In fact, it seems that Binance’s competitors have experienced—if anything—a bit of outflow. CZ Reflects on Missed Ethereum Opportunity In a recent community question-and-answer session, Binance’s chief executive, Changpeng Zhao, took queries from the public that spanned a broad spectrum, including some of a personal nature, like how much Ethereum Zhao himself holds. Zhao said he doesn’t hold much Ether, and hasn’t in some time, maybe because he lost access to older wallets that hold some. “I have a very small amount, and it is really in my very old wallets,” Zhao said. His response seemed to hint at two issues: Zhao’s poor memory when it comes to wallets, and the poor user interface for Ethereum wallets (in which it is easier to lose track of a wallet than with other digital assets). CZ went on to frankly confess that he overlooked an early chance to put money into Ethereum. He remembered his first meeting with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin at a Bitcoin conference in 2013. He recollected the years that came after, learning about Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) in 2014 and how, in 2015, Vitalik had briefly crashed at his Tokyo apartment. Yet, despite this close-to-home tie to the up-and-coming project, CZ confessed to being skeptical about the blockchain’s having a Turing-complete language—a concept that Vitalik had confidently asserted was doable. Defillama reveals that Binance recorded $3.971 billion in net inflows from Feb. 21-27, 2025 following the Bybit hacking incident. In February, Binance recorded net inflows of $5.323 billion. Binance recorded over $3 billion in net inflows in six of the past 12 months, with… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 5, 2025 Looking back, CZ recognized that this mistake was a big one. He joked that had he plowed some money into Ethereum, it might have stopped him from doing a complete 180 and launching Binance and BNB. But, in all seriousness, CZ sees this and other close-call moments as teaching tools—lessons that help him make better decisions in the future. And that Ethereum thing, as it turns out, was an industry-level close call. Vitalik’s Innovations and the Crypto Landscape CZ also reflected on Ethereum and recognized the many contributions made by Vitalik Buterin to the blockchain space. He lauded Vitalik for his innovative thinking and for what he called groundbreaking innovations. For CZ, these innovations are enormously important. They are not only big ideas but also play a huge role in the advancement of the crypto industry. They include the introduction of smart contracts, ERC20 tokens, NFTs, soulbound tokens (SBTs), and Layer 2 solutions. Even though investing in Ethereum was a golden opportunity that the Binance chief missed, he still remains appreciative of what Vitalik Buterin has done and is doing for digital currency. It is shaping the future of “decentralized everything,” in CZ’s words. The Binance chief is an admirer of Buterin and is a lifelong learner in the blockchain industry. He emphasizes the need to keep evolving and adapting to new developments in this sector. Binance’s Continued Growth and Future Prospects Although he may think sometimes about those opportunities that he could have taken, Binance is in an upward path. We see that clearly now in net inflows and in the trust that users have in the platform when times get tough in the crypto market. The success that Binance itself has achieved, along with the platform’s ongoing development of the BNB ecosystem, speaks to the current dominance that CZ’s platform has in the crypto space. As capital continues to flow into Binance, particularly in these unpredictable market conditions, it is obvious that the exchange is one of the leaders in the global cryptocurrency scene. For CZ, which I guess is not really a surprise anymore after last week’s CoinDesk interview, the clear lesson to take away from the past is to be thankful for the successes while also learning from the failures to maintain and build upon that success in the years to come. As Binance’s worldwide sway increases, Changpeng Zhao and his team will almost certainly have to confront fresh problems and prospects in the developing domain of blockchain and digital currency. Yet for all the talk, and even some evidence, that a new era of centralized financial power is upon us, Binance remains in no way part of that story. In fact, by the very nature of its being, Binance contradicts it. Here are the reasons why. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

41270571,https://zycrypto.com/?p=103344,1741332184,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,"President Trump Signs Executive Order To Establish Bitcoin Reserve And Crypto Stockpile, Market Reacts",https://zycrypto.com/president-trump-signs-executive-order-to-establish-bitcoin-reserve-and-crypto-stockpile-market-reacts/,"Less than a week after announcing his administration’s push for a “crypto strategic reserve,” United States President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that creates a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “Digital Asset Stockpile” for other types of assets, both of which will initially use crypto seized in government crypto cases. “Digital Fort Knox” White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks announced Trump’s executive order in a March 7 post , claiming the Bitcoin reserve initiative would not “cost taxpayers a dime.” “The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings.” Sachs said the US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited into the reserve, and it will be kept as a store of value akin to a “digital Fort Knox,” likening the apex crypto to “digital gold.” “The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers,” he noted. The EO directs a full accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings. Sacks highlighted the U.S. government’s estimated 200,000 BTC stash obtained through criminal seizures, bringing the initial estimated reserve value to $17.7 billion. “Premature sales of Bitcoin have already cost U.S. taxpayers over $17 billion in lost value. Now the federal government will have a strategy to maximize the value of its holdings,” Sacks wrote. In a video showing the president signing the order , Trump states about creating the reserve, “Made the promise, right?” https://twitter.com/MargoMartin47/status/1897802829474955415 Trump initially pledged to set up a Bitcoin stockpile held by the U.S. Government back in July 2024 in a bid to curry favor with Bitcoin fans on the campaign trail. A March 6 fact sheet from the White House noted that the order also establishes a “U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile,” which Sacks said would include cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. However, he did not mention any particular assets in that category — despite some being recently named by President Trump . Sacks indicated that the purpose of the stockpile is to ensure “responsible stewardship of the government’s digital assets under the Treasury Department.” He clarified that the government would not acquire additional assets for the stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings. Market Reaction BTC fell from $90,251 to $85,091 in less than an hour after Trump signed the executive order, perhaps because of disappointment that the reserve and stockpile do not include new crypto buys. According to CoinGecko, it has since rebounded slightly to $87,923 as of publication time, still down 4.5% on the day. Charles Edwards, founder of the Bitcoin-focused hedge fund Capriole Investments, described it as the “most underwhelming and disappointing outcome we could have expected for this week.” He contends that without a buying plan, the strategy is a “pig in lipstick.” However, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan posited that the move to create a Bitcoin reserve reduces the possibility that the government would try to ban the asset and “dramatically increases the likelihood that other nations will establish strategic Bitcoin reserves.

41270594,https://nulltx.com/?p=146699,1741332264,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Aave Proposes New sGHO Savings Product to Enhance Yield Earning Opportunities for Users,https://nulltx.com/aave-proposes-new-sgho-savings-product-to-enhance-yield-earning-opportunities-for-users/,"Aave , one of the foremost decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, has announced plans to roll out a new savings product called sGHO aimed at providing GHO holders a compelling way to earn a yield. The low-risk offering will sit atop the GHO stablecoin, which, like its DeFi counterpart DAI, is collateralized in a way that ensures it retains its peg for the foreseeable future. The product offers low risk and high yield opportunities to users. The yield is based on two components: the native Aave lending rate and an incentivized rate derived from GHO borrow revenue (which we dive into more below). This new offering is expected to become the on-chain savings rate for Aave users, and particularly attracts new users to the Aave ecosystem who may be looking for simpler ways to participate in on-chain opportunities. What is sGHO and How Does it Work? sGHO is a new savings product that allows users to earn yield on their GHO holdings without the complexity of high-risk strategies often associated with DeFi products. GHO, Aave’s native stablecoin, will be the underlying asset of this savings product, which aims to attract users seeking a reliable and straightforward way to earn passive income. In contrast to a range of traditional savings products, sGHO will not impose any deposit or withdrawal fees, making it a choice for the cost-averse that live in the DeFi world. sGHO is a savings vehicle that allows users to participate in the Aave ecosystem (and the greater DeFi world) while earning yields and avoiding costs. Unlike the earlier Aave market, where users would have to manually manage their deposits and withdrawals and where the Aave team would have to set risk parameters for the Aave price oracle, Aave has now made checking off both boxes (cost-avoidance and earnings manifestations) and doing so in a customer-friendly way quite simple and quite safe. According to the Aave team, their latest product will unveil an on-chain savings rate pegged to a stable asset, and this savings rate will be much more user-friendly than existing alternatives. When it comes to DeFi, users typically find themselves facing strategies that require sophisticated levels of know-how and commitment. And under those circumstances, it’s hard to pin down any single user interface that’s intuitive and easy to use. In this context, sGHO could be seen as a front porch that invites users to come into the greater Aave ecosystem. Growth Expectations and Revenue Comparison The growth of sGHO is expected to be significant, according to Stani Kulechov, founder of Aave. Kulechov forecasts that sGHO could generate between $300 million and $500 million in outstanding GHO. For comparison, Kulechov said, “With GHO, the Aave DAO’s top-line revenue is already looking very good, and this is something that decentralized on-chain protocols need: stable, reliable, and transparent on-chain revenues. GHO is rewarding the Aave DAO as if it were a stablecoin. And it is almost a parallel money printer relative to the stablecoins that are with USDC for the Aave DAO.” (Kulechov, of course, is not objective.) GHO will not only provide a new way for Aave users to earn yield but also help to drive greater demand and adoption for GHO. By linking the stablecoin to the savings product and offering an attractive yield, Aave is positioning GHO as a core asset within its ecosystem, while also enhancing the appeal of the protocol to a wider range of users. Aave is proposing to create sGHO savings product by introducing Aave Savings Rate (ASR). sGHO is a new low-end risk profile savings product for earning yield on GHO based on native aave lending rate and incentivized rate collected partially from GHO borrow revenue. No withdrawal… — Stani.eth (@StaniKulechov) March 5, 2025 Aave’s Vision for the Future of On-Chain Savings Aave’s vision of a future with accessible and sustainable financial products on the blockchain pushes forward once more with the sGHO savings product. With this, Aave has now introduced a savings rate for users in the context of what DeFi protocols are doing more and more often these days: offering financial services that are simpler, clearer, and more tailored to the average user. In the introduction of sGHO, Aave takes on quite an uncontroversial and obviously beneficial role by providing users with a straightforward, low-risk structuring of their holdings that allows them to earn yield. Decentralized finance is gaining interest, and there’s a growing demand from the market for yield-bearing products. Why should that be a way to attract capital into Aave?” With the Aave sGHO product, we see this simple, low-risk, high-yield product that to me is a compelling option for both seasoned capital allocators and newcomers to DeFi. As far as what we’re calling corner solutions in DeFi, sGHO is one of those because it is serving a very basic function with much higher and better risk-reward dynamics than can be found in the bank. Aave is establishing a new benchmark for on-chain savings by providing a straightforward savings product devoid of the intricate details and dangers that usually come with DeFi. Instead of a savings account, you have sGHO; in lieu of an interest rate, you get a yield. As the DeFi ecosystem evolves, new products will inevitably help with the transition from traditional finance to this new world. sGHO is one such product. Conclusion Aave’s proposed sGHO savings product is an important new component in the DeFi space, offering users a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings that is as close to low-risk as seems possible in the DeFi ecosystem. With its straightforward structure, appealing returns, and the lack of any kind of fees, sGHO is a contender to become a Go-To savings product on Aave, an alternative to staked AAVE and a clear use case for GHO that touches upon the Federal Reserve’s prohibition on private stablecoins.

Decentralized finance ‘s total value locked fell by nearly 23% in February, dropping from $217 billion to $168 billion as market volatility, liquidity shifts, and capital outflows pressured key protocols, says DappRadar’s analyst Sara Gherghelas. In a recent research report , Gherghelas pointed out that Ethereum ( ETH ), which holds nearly 60% of DeFi’s liquidity, saw its TVL fall 27% to $97 billion in February. The decline was mainly due to lower liquidity in liquid staking protocols, the analyst notes. However, despite the decline, Ethereum’s dominance in this area “remains unchallenged,” per Gherghelas. TVL of the top networks | Source: DappRadar Solana ( SOL ) suffered the largest losses in February as its TVL dropped by more than 30% to $15.4 billion. The decline came after a strong January and was likely driven by “profit-taking and liquidity migration toward more stable DeFi environments,” says the DappRadar analyst. On top of that, activity also slowed on key Solana-based platforms like crypto exchange Jupiter and Raydium. While most major chains faced challenges, Berachain ( BERA ) turned out to be one of the few winners, reaching a TVL of $5.05 billion, according to data. “The chain’s rise is fueled by its proof-of-liquidity model, which has attracted users through lucrative liquid staking and yield farming incentives. As users seek high returns despite broader market declines, Berachain is positioning itself as a key player in the evolving DeFi landscape.” Sara Gherghelas You might also like: Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade on Sepolia encounters issues BNB Chain ( BNB ) saw a smaller drop of 11%, helped by stablecoin trading. Meanwhile, TRON’s ( TRX ) TVL fell 29%, likely due to weaker demand for Tether’s ( USDT ) transactions. Aptos ( APT ) was also one of the rare gainers, increasing its TVL by 6% to $1.83 billion. Ethereum’s drop in TVL comes as futures open interest in key cryptocurrencies also fell sharply. As crypto.news reported, traders have started reducing long positions, with futures open interest falling amid concerns over the trade war and the Fed’s tough stance. Matrixport analysts believe many traders are waiting for clearer signals before re-entering the market. While the upcoming Pectra upgrade, which aims to improve network functionality and fee efficiency, could provide a short-term boost, it’s unclear whether these upgrades will be enough to reverse the decline in DeFi activity.

41270631,https://nulltx.com/?p=146698,1741332434,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Solana’s Wild Week: Trump Boosts SOL, MetaMask Expands Support, and CME Launches Futures",https://nulltx.com/solanas-wild-week-trump-boosts-sol-metamask-expands-support-and-cme-launches-futures/,"This past week was a rollercoaster for Solana ($SOL), with the blockchain token experiencing significant price action. Trump announced his forthcoming NFT , which led to some price action in various cryptocurrencies, including Solana. The Solana ecosystem saw some moonshots as institutional developments started to pour in. One of the high points—and there were many—was the alliance between Solana and Discord. Altogether, the week had some ups and downs. But by the end of it, the Solana ecosystem is well intact, with the token’s price sitting at $137. Solana’s Seesaw Week: Price Surges and Falls High-profile announcements that send the market into overdrive largely dictate Solana’s price movements. A strategic reserve statement from Trump had a profound impact, causing the price of SOL to surge from $140 to $178 almost overnight. However, the euphoria was short-lived, with gains quickly wiped out a day later amid the renewed national security concerns that have dogged the former president as of late. So, was Solana a loser this week? Not necessarily. It was a stable ride. Despite the price rollercoaster, we were able to close out the week with only a 1% dip, ending the week with a market cap of $69.44 billion. This week’s developments showcase Solana’s exposure to outside market forces. At the same time, they spotlight the blockchain’s continued viability, even as some of its biggest boosters have been forced to take a step back. Solana vs. The Competition: Market Performance and Cross-Chain Dynamics Regarding competition, Solana eclipsed Ethereum ($ETH), which registered a 12% decrease, and kept showing it was ahead in some domains. Solana’s decentralized app (dApp) revenue has stayed robust, with a daily take of $6.73 million. For something that’s often dismissed as being “unsustainable,” given the apparent over-reliance on revenue from so-called “Web3” apps, this is a pretty decent number and suggests that the Solana ecosystem as a whole is doing better than most. And by “most,” I mean even those apps in supposedly more sustainable ecosystems, like Ethereum. Although Solana’s dApp revenue is quite impressive, it still faces fierce competition in terms of fees. TRON continues to lead in daily fees, bringing in $2.09 million, compared to Solana’s $1.49 million. Solana, however, seems to have retaken its crown in the NFT space, with a 27.3% user share. Despite the challenges it may face in some other areas, Solana appears to be a favorite platform for the NFT community, which is growing steadily. Rephrasing in a simple way while keeping the original formatting: Solana is doing particularly well in generating money from decentralized apps. That is especially noteworthy because it shows something we always suspected: Solana can handle real, live applications. We never doubted Solana could support real, live decentralized applications, but now we know it can do so at significant scale and with significant market penetration. (To be fair, the NFT market is also growing, but you don’t have to tell me that.) Moreover, this dApp revenue generation is happening despite the fact that Solana’s dApps currently serve their users with only a fraction of the basic functionality you might expect from, say, the dApps on Ethereum. Solana Ecosystem Performance: Gains and Losses Solana may have presented strength in the market, but not all of its assets shared the same fortune. The performances of many tokens in the Solana ecosystem formed a rather mixed picture. On the one hand, GRASS, a Solana-based token, was one of the biggest gainers, surging 38% over the week. Some other tokens like ATH (+6%) showed positive signs, but overall, the ecosystem looked to be on borrowed time because losses outweighed the gains. The biggest losers in the ecosystem were FTT (-26%), JTO (-16%), and RAY (-16%), which together were doubtless responsible for contributing to the 6% decline in the overall ecosystem market cap to $637 billion. Week in Solana: The Big $SOL Seesaw on the Trump Train. Trump pumps SOL 27%! CME launches futures March 17! MetaMask adds support! GRASS soars 38%! Let's unpack Solana's rollercoaster week 1/6 pic.twitter.com/ApfU7dLhdJ — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) March 5, 2025 Even so, the total value locked (TVL) in Solana’s DeFi ecosystem only decreased modestly by 2%, and managed to outperform both Ethereum and Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s TVL fell by 9% and Bitcoin’s fell by 10%. Solana maintained its spot as a key DeFi player and showed continued relevance, even as the appearance of a downturn kept many in the crypto world guessing. Institutional Moves and Major Developments for Solana The Solana network is seeing increased institutional engagement, and this is seen as a development that opens a new chapter for the network. On March 17, 2025, the CME Group, one of the largest derivatives exchanges, launched Solana futures contracts. This was a big deal and is expected to bring in a new wave of institutional interest to and exposure of the Solana network. And why wouldn’t it? Solana is a top 10 crypto by market cap. Can it get more relevant than that? Another signal of Solana’s expanding adoption was that Trump’s strategic reserve announcement brought a lot of attention to the blockchain. Solana was notably added to the list of cryptocurrencies that make up the U.S. strategic reserve, underscoring its prominence on the global financial stage. Adding Solana to this reserve is being interpreted as a major endorsement that could result in a lot more institutional buy-in. Also, one of the most widely used cryptocurrency wallets, MetaMask, has expressed that it will extend its support to Solana. This sort of accessibility is significant to Solana’s attempt at mainstream crypto adoption, as it effectively removes some of the hurdles that existed for potential users who couldn’t or didn’t want to use Solana’s native wallet. Moreover, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) reported issuing the first Solana-referenced, exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—SOLZ and SOLT—providing institutional investors a fresh avenue to access the burgeoning Solana ecosystem. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Solana? The week has been a whirlwind of activity for Solana, with price changes, ecosystem developments, and fresh institutional interest. If the blockchain had a stock price, it would have gotten a decent haircut on Friday morning, as reports surfaced, mostly in CoinDesk, that the Solana Foundation had laid off a number of its employees. In no way is this a sign of impending doom, given that Solana seems set to remain in the institutionally favored camp. Indeed, the long view with Solana is not just bright but blinding. The launch of Solana futures and the inclusion in the U.S. strategic reserve are meant to attract even more institutional investors, who are seen as a path to mainstream blockchain legitimacy. Solana’s NFT revenue, its dApp revenue, and its fairly recent collection of half a dozen or so ETFs in the institutional toolbox also suggest that Solana is not just going to go away. As Solana changes and keeps pace with the fast-advancing cryptocurrency world, it can almost be taken for granted that it will continue to hold down a pivotal spot in the decentralized finance ecosystem—at least, as new and not-so-new competitors keep flooding the space. Institutional backing and user adoption seen these last few days might elicit the question: Is Solana about to embark on an exciting new chapter? Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

What is REZ, and is it headed towards more potential gains? According to data from CoinGecko, Renzo ( REZ ) rallied to an intraday high of $0.032, over 145% higher than its lowest point this year. The altcoin’s market cap was seated at $63 million, while its daily trading volume more than doubled over the previous day at nearly $281 million. REZ’s gains were accompanied by a surge in demand from derivatives traders. According to CoinGlass data, open interest in its futures market jumped 92% to an all-time high of $42 million. However, weighted funding rates have fallen further into negative territory as most traders seem to bet on a potential short-term price drop. Most of the gains today came after REZ recently secured a listing on Coinbase on the Ethereum (ERC-20 token) network. The altcoin has been rallying since the exchange announced its listing.

The rally has been supported by increased whale activity, with the number of large holder addresses hodling between 10,000 to 100 million tokens spiking over the past 24 hours, while the number of daily active addresses on the network has been rising over the past 2 days. Source: Santiment Analysts believe REZ could maintain its bullish trajectory as long as it holds above the key support range of $0.01674 to $0.01724. Technical indicators also present a bullish outlook for the altcoin, likely supporting more gains ahead. REZ price, Aroon and MACD chart — March 7 | Source: crypto.news On the 1-day/USDT price chart, the Aroon Up indicator at 92.86% and Aroon Down at 28.57% confirm strong buying pressure, which signals a dominant uptrend. The MACD and signal lines have moved upward, presenting the potential of a bullish reversal, which could lead to more gains over the upcoming days. Sell-off concerns loom However, the rally could abruptly come to an end due to sell-side pressure. When writing, REZ had lost some of the past day’s gains but was up 41.5%. Some community members are concerned over a potential sell-off by VC Funds and the Renzo team, who currently hold a combined 51.6% of the altcoin’s total supply. Listing on a major crypto exchange such as Coinbase or Binance typically leads to a significant surge in the related asset’s price. However, they tend to face a mean drop following such listings. As crypto.news reported earlier, following its previous listing on Binance, REZ dropped 43% within a day. What is REZ crypto? Founded in 2023, U.S.-based Renzo is a re-staking protocol that lets users stake a variety of crypto assets while offering features like auto-compounding rewards and automated risk management. REZ, which serves as the native and governance token, can be restaked through EigenLayer, allowing holders to secure various Actively Validated Services and earn additional rewards. Besides Coinbase, REZ is available on several major crypto exchanges, including Binance, Gate.io, Kraken, and KuCoin, among others.

At Epoch 743, expected to begin this weekend, Solana validators will vote on Solana Improvement Document-0228, a governance proposal that ties inflation rates to staking participation. SIMD-0228: As we head to the vote in epoch 753, I am proud to share that we have spent almost two months discussing SIMD-0228 in public. (Check screenshot for details). Throughout the process, we incorporated several pieces of community feedback: 1. Transitioned from a… pic.twitter.com/0g138cFGY8 — Vishal Kankani (@kankanivishal) March 6, 2025 The proposal was put forward by Tushar Jain and Vishal Kankani of Multicoin Capital, with support from Max Resnick, lead economist at Anza, a key player in Solana’s development ecosystem. SIMD-0228 aims to replace Solana’s fixed inflation schedule with a market-driven emissions model that adjusts the issuance of new SOL tokens based on the percentage of the total SOL supply that is staked. Currently, Solana follows a fixed inflation structure where the annual issuance rate is 4.6%, decreasing by 15% each year until it stabilizes at 1.5%. Under the new model, inflation would be dynamically adjusted based on staking participation, ensuring the network optimally balances security incentives and token supply. If the percentage of staked SOL falls below 33%, the proposal suggests increasing the inflation rate to encourage more staking, ensuring sufficient network security. On the other hand, if staking participation remains high, the system would lower emissions, preventing unnecessary token dilution. This mechanism is designed to ensure that Solana doesn’t “overpay” for security when there is already strong staking participation, which could help reduce long-term inflationary pressure. You might also like: Solana co-founder says no to government-run crypto reserve The proposal has led to mixed reactions within the community. Proponents like VanEck digital asset research head Matthew Sigel argue that this dynamic model aligns Solana’s monetary policy with its economic activity, potentially making SOL scarcer and more valuable when staking participation is high. “Maintaining a predictable and low inflation rate can support SOL’s value by reducing dilution and sell pressure,” Siegel wrote in a March 4 X post. Estimates suggest that if the proposal is approved, with staking currently around 65%, inflation could drop below 1% annually. Meanwhile, one critic argues that the proposal might be focusing on the wrong metric. In a March 7 X post , MetaDAO co-founder Nallok argued that instead of adjusting inflation based on staking participation, Solana should be looking at dynamic base fees. While he acknowledges that reducing inflation “makes complete sense” if Solana is gearing up for an ETF , MetaDAO co-founder Nallok isn’t convinced that SIMD-0228 is the right approach. He suggested that the proposal’s impact should be cut in half, arguing that the community could “always circle back” if further adjustments were needed. Nallok also warned against relying too much on recent block performance and validator data, calling it “unwise” to make long-term decisions based on short-term trends. Nallok also pointed out that the validator set may shrink over time, either through market forces or deliberate adjustments, and urged the community to consider a broader, more sustainable path rather than locking in a “new status quo” too soon.

41270771,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137908,1741332617,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Concerning $134.4M Bitcoin ETF Outflows: Spot ETFs Face Unexpected Exodus,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/concerning-bitcoin-etf-outflows/,"Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility, but recent data has sent ripples of concern through the investment community. On March 6th, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a notable shift in momentum, registering a substantial $134.4 million in net outflows. This sudden exodus raises questions about investor sentiment and the short-term trajectory of these highly anticipated investment vehicles. Let’s dive into the details of this development and understand what it might signify for the future of spot Bitcoin ETFs . What Sparked the Sudden ETF Outflows? According to an X post by Trader T (@thepfund), March 6th marked a day of net outflows for U.S. Bitcoin ETFs . While inflows have generally been the norm since their approval, this reversal is noteworthy. Here’s a breakdown of the outflows across different ETF providers: BlackRock IBIT : Leading the outflows with $50.71 million. Grayscale GBTC : Following closely with $34.51 million in outflows. Franklin Templeton EZBC : Experienced $18.05 million in net outflows. ARK Invest ARKB : Recorded $17.76 million in outflows. VanEck HODL : Saw $8.18 million leaving the ETF. WisdomTree BTCW : Experienced $5.19 million in net outflows. Interestingly, other spot Bitcoin ETF issuers reported no change in their holdings on March 6th. This concentrated outflow from several major players suggests a potentially coordinated or sentiment-driven market movement. Grayscale GBTC’s Continued Outflows: A Drag on the Market? Grayscale GBTC has been a subject of much discussion since the conversion of its Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF. While the ETF conversion was initially seen as a positive catalyst, GBTC has consistently experienced outflows. This is largely attributed to its higher fee structure compared to newer ETFs and investors taking profits or seeking lower-cost alternatives. The $34.51 million outflow from GBTC on March 6th is part of this ongoing trend and contributes significantly to the overall net outflow figure. The consistent outflows from Grayscale GBTC are a key factor to consider when analyzing the overall health and momentum of spot Bitcoin ETFs. While other ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT have seen significant inflows historically, even IBIT experienced outflows on this particular day, highlighting a broader shift in market dynamics. Are BlackRock IBIT Outflows a Cause for Alarm? BlackRock IBIT , which has been a star performer among the new spot Bitcoin ETFs, also experienced net outflows of $50.71 million on March 6th. This is particularly noteworthy because IBIT has consistently attracted substantial inflows, often offsetting outflows from GBTC and other ETFs. The fact that even IBIT saw outflows raises questions about whether this is a temporary blip or the start of a more sustained trend. While a single day’s outflow doesn’t necessarily indicate a long-term shift, it’s crucial to monitor whether this becomes a recurring pattern for BlackRock IBIT and other leading ETFs. Sustained outflows could indicate waning institutional interest or profit-taking after the initial surge of enthusiasm following ETF approvals. Spot Bitcoin ETF Performance: Beyond a Single Day It’s important to contextualize this single day of ETF outflows within the broader performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Since their launch in January 2024, these ETFs have collectively accumulated billions of dollars in assets under management (AUM). They have provided a regulated and accessible pathway for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Here’s a quick recap of the benefits spot Bitcoin ETFs offer: Accessibility : Democratize Bitcoin investment by allowing access through traditional brokerage accounts. Regulation : Operate within established regulatory frameworks, providing investor protection. Liquidity : Offer high liquidity, enabling easy buying and selling of Bitcoin exposure. Tax Efficiency (Potentially) : Can offer tax advantages compared to holding Bitcoin directly (depending on jurisdiction and individual circumstances). Institutional Adoption : Facilitate institutional investment in Bitcoin, potentially driving broader market growth. Despite the positive long-term outlook and the inherent advantages, ETF outflows like those seen on March 6th serve as a reminder that the crypto market remains susceptible to fluctuations in sentiment and broader macroeconomic factors. What Actionable Insights Can Investors Glean? For investors, the $134.4 million ETF outflows on March 6th provide several key insights: Market Sentiment is Dynamic : Even in a bull market, sentiment can shift quickly. Monitoring ETF flows can provide clues about investor positioning. GBTC Outflows Continue to Influence : The ongoing outflows from GBTC remain a significant factor in overall ETF flow dynamics. IBIT Flows are Key Indicator : Watch for trends in IBIT flows as a barometer of institutional interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs. Long-Term Perspective is Crucial : A single day’s outflow should not overshadow the long-term potential and overall positive trend of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Diversification Remains Important : Even with ETFs, diversification across asset classes and within crypto investments is crucial to manage risk. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Bitcoin ETF Landscape The net outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on March 6th serve as a timely reminder of the crypto market’s inherent volatility and the dynamic nature of investor sentiment. While the long-term outlook for Bitcoin ETFs remains positive, driven by increased accessibility and institutional adoption, short-term fluctuations and ETF outflows are to be expected. Investors should closely monitor these trends, stay informed, and maintain a balanced perspective when navigating the evolving landscape of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments.

41270768,https://nulltx.com/?p=146697,1741332659,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,The Decline of Pump.fun: Solana’s Memecoin Scene Faces Major Fatigue,https://nulltx.com/the-decline-of-pump-fun-solanas-memecoin-scene-faces-major-fatigue/,"Solana’s once-thriving memecoin sector—one that saw explosive growth during the past year—has taken a sharp downturn in trading activity, with recent reports even highlighting a dramatic fall in trading volume. Pump.fun, a platform that has been a major hub for Solana’s memecoin ecosystem, has seen trading volume absolutely tank by 94%. From a high of $3 billion in January 2025, trading volume on the platform has collapsed to just $146 million—an indication that the memecoin hype on Solana is beginning to lose its steam. Once seen as a cornerstone of Solana’s ecosystem, the memecoin sector is now in decline. Its community is reeling from some substantial hits to interest and trust and is showing a little energy at the moment. This watershed moment is being driven by several factors: a series of rug pulls, meme piracy, and essentially, a downturn in the fundamental concept of a memecoin. You know the speculative frenzy we keep referencing? It seems to be edging away in both seen and unseen ways. Trust Erodes Amid Rug Pulls and Shady Promotions There are a few key reasons for the swift downturn in the popularity of Solana-based memecoins. One of the most significant of these is the increasing number of rug pulls and shady projects that have infiltrated the memecoin universe. And these have some pretty disastrous effects on the space. Not only is the Solana ecosystem having to contend with a serious deficit in developer trust (a risk that all ecosystems face when developers pull the rug on users), but the memecoin itself now is also viewed as a much riskier investment than before. In the Solana memecoin scene, rug pulls, during which developers leave a project after draining liquidity from the market, have been a familiar occurrence. As these scams have spread, investor confidence has started to dwindle, and many users have begun to question the validity of new memecoins that enter the market. This loss of trust has had a direct impact on the volume of new tokens that are being listed on decentralized exchanges, like Raydium, a popular platform for Solana-based assets. Now, fewer tokens are being listed, and the once-active scene of trading Solana memecoins has started to stagnate. Trust has also been eroded by shady promotions. The aggressive marketing campaigns that promote memecoins come with promises boosted by too-good-to-be-true claims. In many instances, these promotions are backed by no-accountability influencers or anonymous teams, which has fueled skepticism among potential investors. Of course, this isn’t to say that memecoins are now completely off-limits. Some traders and enthusiasts still feel comfortable diving into a new memecoin or investing in an existing one. But anyone embarking on such an adventure these days realizes that the risks are often just not worth it. The Fall of Memecoins and the Shift in Solana’s Ecosystem The Solana ecosystem is facing the same downturn that has recently befallen the memecoin market. After a period of insane growth and interest, Solana’s memecoin scene appears to be slowing down. The Solana memecoin market has pulled back like any good market should after an insane surge. The hype that drove the Solana memecoin market to new heights has subsided, and now we are experiencing the hangover from the surge. At its peak, the memecoin market was a thrilling and extremely speculative corner of Solana’s blockchain, drawing in both sharp traders and wet-behind-the-ears novices eager to ride the latest trend. Memecoins, often created as jests or for the sake of experimentation, built themselves a wild following, especially in the halcyon days of early 2025. Yet, the real worth of many such projects became of ever-growing concern. How could we take seriously a coin that didn’t claim to be anything more than a laughing stock? We couldn’t, and that’s why we raised the alarm. https://t.co/PJIijlPble ’s trading volume has collapsed—down 94% from $3B in January to just $146M. The memecoin hype isn’t hitting like before. Fewer tokens are making it to Raydium, and after all the rug pulls and shady promos, trust is wearing thin. $SOL’s once-explosive… pic.twitter.com/VhIUnXkjqb — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) March 5, 2025 The memecoin downturn has had a ripple effect across the Solana ecosystem. With the Solana development community experiencing a serious slowdown, Solana is now trying to use this moment to refocus on diversifying its use cases and attracting projects that are more sustainable and have a longer-term vision. To some observers, this is both ironic and fitting. It is fitting because Solana is known for being a fast, cheap, and dev-friendly blockchain and (in)famous for being a home for meme-spawning projects. Even with all these setbacks, Solana is still a top blockchain network. It is working on quite a few substantial developments and significant innovations in other areas, like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming. It is worth holding up, though, that the collapse of the memecoin scene, for whatever it is worth, has underscored the very real volatility of the crypto market and the risk that speculative assets can and do pose to a blockchain’s good name. What’s Next for Solana and Memecoins? Though the fall of Pump.fun and the wider decline of Solana’s memecoin market may signal an era’s end for this particular Solana sector, it is unlikely to be the end of Solana itself. The blockchain has a lot more going on. Serious projects with a real utility continue to use it. And even within the memecoin market, some believe that what is going on with Pump.fun and the other recent declines is just a prelude to the blockchain’s next To restore Solana’s memecoin scene, trust and credibility must be rebuilt in the community. This can be done via some combination of the following: – More transparent projects. – Greater regulation of memecoin promotions. – A get-rich-quick mentality that has fueled much of the hype. Moreover, the developers might consider creating memecoins that do offer something more than speculative trading opportunities. Solana needs to keep diversifying its services and building a sturdy ecosystem that delivers lasting value if it’s going to hold on to its place as one of crypto’s top-tier blockchain networks. Otherwise, its path looks rather similar to that of other once-prominent blockchains. In the meantime, memecoins show just how risky and volatile the crypto business remains. To conclude, the growth of Solana’s memecoin market, which we saw with Pump.fun, has definitely slowed down. But Solana’s not going anywhere. And neither are any of us who are in the ecosystem. So us—Solana and all of us in the ecosystem—are looking to the next phase of evolution, which should be more sustainable and won’t be driven by tokens that are ‘meme-based.’ It should be driven by actual utility. Let’s hope that should name next phase the ‘next evolution phase’. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Not only does the space now hold over 1 billion SEI tokens, but this trading pair has also garnered enough interest to pay attention once more to the SEI blockchain specifically. That’s a pretty obvious setup for the current narrative surrounding SEI and the way it has seemingly bounced back from its previous period of crypto winter. What’s perhaps far more relevant in the current conversation is how TVL can often signal the next big payment for a blockchain’s native token. $SEI has just smashed past its previous all-time high in TVL, now holding over 1 billion #SEI . That’s some serious momentum for an L1 like this. What’s brewing over there? Something big or just another hype cycle? pic.twitter.com/myBsPDBqBW — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) March 5, 2025 The SEI token is currently in the “smart money buy zone.” Trading volume has surged, and there has been a noticeable increase in institutional interest. This rise in activity, coupled with a classic cup-bottom chart formation, suggests that SEI may be entering a new phase of growth. SEI’s Explosive Growth and Institutional Backing In the last few months, the $SEI token has experienced impressive growth to a level that is pretty much gaining serious interest in the DeFi space. Its TVL has recently crossed the $1 billion level, showing promise of serious traction for this relatively new platform. This makes it currently the third-ranked blockchain in TVL behind the established top two layer 1 (L1) blockchains, Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. This remarkable surge in TVL displays the trust that investors place in SEI’s long-lasting viability. There is ever more liquidity entering the ecosystem, and with it, the platform’s infrastructure keeps growing and getting more resilient, which is an open invitation to the dApps and services to use this infrastructure and do even better than before. SEI’s growth coincides with the many blockchain projects that are still reeling from the volatility of 2024. In this stormy environment, SEI has captured a fair amount of attention. Why? Because the layers it offers are scalable, secure, and fast—the trifecta, in effect. By using SEI, developers can build decentralized apps in an ecosystem that has all the growth and innovation vibes of an app store. Major Investment from Trump-backed World Liberty Financial Besides organic growth, SEI is pulling in real institutional interest. A couple of months ago, World Liberty Financial—an investment firm co-founded by former President Donald Trump—made a serious play in the SEI market. According to figures from Arkham, World Liberty Financial picked up 547,990 $SEI tokens worth about 125,000 USDC. That’s not chump change, and it’s yet another sign that serious players are coming into the SEI ecosystem. If nothing else, World Liberty Financial’s move is a very solid “vote of confidence” for the SEI platform. World Liberty Financial’s acquisition is yet another signal to the market that institutions are adopting blockchain technology. $SEI is sitting in the smart money buy zone with volume surging. Classic cup-bottom formation TVL just smashed ATH, crossing $1B+ $SEI first in Stables —massive momentum for an L1! Swing trade Recently Trump-backed World Liberty Financial bought 547,990 $SEI with… pic.twitter.com/fCP4W0cRo2 — Bitcoin Buddha (@Bitcoin_Buddah) March 6, 2025 In particular, Layer-1 networks like SEI are gaining traction with institutions. For decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain companies, World Liberty Financial’s decision to acquire more than just tokens and, instead, also gain equity in SEI is an important seal of approval for the underlying technology. It suggests that the company that handles several billion dollars in financial transactions is betting on the success of Layer-1 networks, DeFi, and the blockchain revolution. That could have real implications for the bottom line. SEI in the Smart Money Buy Zone: A Technical Analysis In terms of tech, the $SEI token is now in what appears to be the “smart money buy zone.” This is a fancy term for when an asset’s price seems to be low compared with how much it should be growing. That’s when you find big, institutional investors and seasoned retail investors buying up an asset. And why not? The recent volume surge combined with the appearance of a certain chart pattern has some folks thinking that $SEI could be on the verge of breaking out. If that happens, and you’re holding some, you’ll definitely be capitalizing on the future growth of the asset. Presently, the chart discloses a “cup-bottom” formation, a pattern frequently observed in the price charts of assets that implies a reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend. By and large, a cup-bottom formation indicates that an asset is fully primed to reclaim lost territory and begin an upswing. If this pattern continues to hold, $SEI could be reaching a breakout moment, making it an ideal buy candidate for anyone looking to get in now before the next big rally. Increasing adoption of the SEI blockchain is anticipated by many investors and analysts who are closely following its developments. The SEI blockchain is expected to see continuing adoption growth, as is predicted for decentralized finance applications and the kinds of developments that make use of smart contracts. SEI’s Future Prospects: A Layer-1 Blockchain to Watch The recent accomplishments, along with support from institutions such as World Liberty Financial, make it seem like the future for SEI is as clear as the…well, future. Layer 1 blockchains are already vying for attention and investors, but many (including the ones listed above) promise potential. Their various abilities to address the shortcomings of previous generations of blockchain technologies put a spotlight on SEI and its mechanism for achieving consensus. SEI’s TVL more than doubled to $397 million over the last month, with institutional investments from a range of large entities. Overall, the projects and platforms within SEI have received major votes of confidence. Investors should be paying close attention to SEI as it continues to be one of the most talked-about Layer-1 platforms among blockchain projects. The “smart money” flow says it all. Investors and developers should consider the rapid movement of SEI as toward becoming a dominant player in the blockchain space. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

41270982,https://nulltx.com/?p=146695,1741332962,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Whale and Smart Dex Trader Accumulate $MORPHO: Positive Signals for Morpho Labs,https://nulltx.com/whale-and-smart-dex-trader-accumulate-morpho-positive-signals-for-morpho-labs/,"A notable change has occurred for the decentralized finance (DeFi) sphere—the $MORPHO token has accumulated considerably across the hands of both institutional and savvy retail investors. Just in the past 24 hours, two high-profile individuals have made some serious buys of the token, which now seems like a pretty confident bet on the future of the Morpho protocol. Significantly, there are two prominent buyers of $MORPHO that have been observed adding to their positions recently: an address known as 0x58d9 (a.k.a. the whale investor @izebel_eth on Twitter) and an address known as 0x17bb (a.k.a. the Smart Dex Trader @yondercode). Both have made what appear to be rather substantial purchases: 200,000 $MORPHO tokens worth about $343.1K (by 0x58d9) and 38,200 $MORPHO tokens worth around $65.6K (by 0x17bb). These acquisitions are making waves, and for good reason. They point to potentially increasing optimism among both individual and institutional actors that the $MORPHO token and its associated platform is a sound investment. Growing Confidence in Morpho Protocol The lending and borrowing of crypto assets in a decentralized and overcollateralized way has been gaining traction in the space of DeFi, thanks to a protocol called Morpho. Recent buying activity appears to indicate that investors see a strong future for the protocol. Morpho affords users a streamlined and secure means of accessing the rapidly expanding market of cryptocurrency lending and borrowing. Morpho’s decentralized asset-lending protocol is attracting the attention of both whales and sophisticated traders, thanks to its unique model. Morphé is based on the rapid growth of decentralized finance (DeFi), which attracts the attention of most traders. DeFi offers advantages over centralized finance (CeFi), including flexibility, transparency, and security. Yet most DeFi lending services operate similarly to those in the centralized world; they pay interest to lenders but charge interest to borrowers. Morphó has a more sophisticated model, which enables it to divide the earnings of this lending service between those two. Thus, both lend-ers and borrowers use it. Whale and Smart Dex Trader Purchases Signal Confidence Morpho’s increasing appeal is underscored further by the recent large acquisitions of $MORPHO tokens by both the whale and the SDT. Notably, 200,000 $MORPHO tokens were just hoisted up by our watery friend. (Unfortunately, we don’t have a visual of this either.) This massive purchase of nearly half a million dollars’ worth of tokens signals some serious confidence in Morpho’s long-term value from a whale that could’ve just as easily gobbled up some other trendy DeFi token. $MORPHO is now accumulated by both a whale and a Smart Dex Trader over the past 24 hours – Whale 0x58d9 aka @izebel_eth bought 200K MORPHO ($343.1K ) – SDT 0x17bb aka @yondercode bought 38.2K MORPHO ($65.6K) @MorphoLabs is showing positive signals. Wallet Address below pic.twitter.com/viWIOQf9Zf — iCrypto | Sentiment & On-chain Analysis (@iCryptoAI) March 6, 2025 When you go big in the DeFi space, you make waves. And that’s why the 200,000 tokens just picked up by the Morpho whale matter. Besides the whale’s purchase, the acquisition of 38,200 $MORPHO tokens by the SDT indicates that more seasoned, small-scale traders are starting to pay attention to the protocol. These SDTs are often highly active and trade in a very sophisticated manner across various decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to front-run and capitalize on market movements. Their recent foray into the $MORPHO token market suggests that they believe the $MORPHO token is a good bet and a potential market mover in the near future. A growing consensus is emerging among both large investors and experienced traders. They now consider Morpho a good investment, one that is likely to provide substantial value in the DeFi ecosystem. Their accumulation of $MORPHO tokens is a sure sign that the protocol has the kind of street cred that only a few projects in this space seem to have. And that’s in addition to the recognition of Morpho’s potential to totally disrupt the lending and borrowing market. Morpho Labs Showing Positive Signals The folks at Morpho, Morpho Labs, are making substantial progress in constructing a solid and scalable decentralized lending protocol. The favorable sentiment surrounding $MORPHO is also indicative of the platform’s ongoing development and the escalating interest it’s receiving from the broader DeFi community. Morpho Labs has been burning the midnight oil to enhance the protocol’s features and user experience, to shore up its security, and to ensure that it remains well-positioned in the DeFi space as that sector itself evolves. Additionally, the recent increased interest in $MORPHO could be ascribed to the overall growth in the DeFi sector. With decentralized finance taking off and attracting both retail and institutional investors, protocols like Morpho are set to benefit from this development. Offering a novel overcollateralized lending model, which seems to appeal to both serious investors and retail traders, Morpho Labs is trying to establish a place for itself in the DeFi ecosystem. Future Outlook for $MORPHO and Morpho Protocol Key Takeaways: – Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is part of the ongoing evolution of crypto markets. – Morph Finance is an emerging player in the DeFi space. – Morph’s core innovation is a mesh network of liquidity pools that lets users access DeFi capital without relying on conventional financial institutions. – Among its competitors, Morph is in a leadership path. The pace of lending and borrowing in morph pools is several orders of magnitude greater than that in competing DEXes like Aave, Compound, and Fulcrum. Increasing support from investors, including big fish and Smart Dex Traders, gives us a positive take on $MORPHO. The platform keeps refining its product. Its user base keeps expanding. Is demand for the token going to go up? We think so. To sum up, the recent accumulation of $MORPHO by a whale and a Smart Dex Trader emphasizes the rising trust in the Morpho protocol. The overcollateralized lending model, coupled with unyielding support from the DeFi community, makes Morpho a top contender in the decentralized finance space. With patient, hands-on developers and a growing cadre of investors, Morpho is primed to continue its path of most resistance—upward and through the disruptive econ gulf between crypto lending/borrowing and us.

In November 2023, U.S. Customs and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) seized Bitcoin mining equipment, arguing that the chips contained restricted technology from the Chinese chip company Sophgo. At the time, U.S. Customs and the FCC said that the chips may have contained radio interference, but this seemed like an excuse for targeting Chinese technology. Ethan Vera, COO of Luxor Technology, said that although some equipment has been released, many remain detained. Sophgo, a Chinese company, owns most of the machines. The U.S. claims that Sophgo was secretly working with Huawei, and that this warranted a seizure because the latter is a blacklisted company. American authorities claim that this supposed link justified the seizure because it was hard for them to clear the equipment. Sophgo has denied having a business relationship with Huawei. One company has said that it is now being charged a holding fee for the seizure of its machines. It owns 200 ASICs and now has a bill worth $200,000. In total, around 10,000 mining machines were seized at various U.S. ports. Some retailers claim that their equipment was valued at $5 million. However, some Chinese ASICs were not seized by officials and continued to make their way to American retailers. These seizures present a problem for Trump’s plan to make America the crypto capital of the world. The disruption of mining equipment could limit the Bitcoin hashrate and impede the market growth of cryptocurrencies. President Trump has pushed hard to support Bitcoin mining in America. He has even stated that he wants the remaining Bitcoin mined in America. The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security is responsible for setting a strategy against Chinese mining requirements. They have created a set of rules for dealing with advanced semiconductors, focusing on crypto and AI and preventing Chinese progress. The problem, however, is that China supplies around 98% of all chips used in crypto mining. The largest manufacturer, Bitmain, has expanded operations in the U.S., focusing mainly on increased delivery speeds. Bitmain has made a public statement, saying that it is confident in its progress and that it will benefit industry partners in America. Despite a large percentage of chips produced in China, around 38% of Bitcoin’s hashrate is based in America. Therefore, crypto’s success seems to be based on Chinese American collaboration. However, the U.S. and China are locked in a trade war, with America focusing on competing for AI and military dominance. America has an advantage with chip design. China has a manufacturing advantage and is making much progress in research and development. Huawei, a leading company in AI, has been blacklisted by America, limiting the amount of companies it can source from. This is not a new problem because the U.S. has blocked Huawei for a long time. This is why Huawei has an extensive Research and Development programme, because they have to make their products from scratch. However, this has only benefited Huawei because it now has cutting-edge technology and an experienced team of innovators.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,MINING|BTC|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-07 07:36:31

Even though the crypto market has been a tad volatile of late, the preeminent cryptocurrency has kept showing its resilience—a quality that always seems to give rise to hopes for yet more upward price momentum. One trend accompanying the price surge, and sure to be of interest to retail investors, has been the apparent increase in the number of Bitcoin wallets. Yet, this uptick in retail investor activity could just be the cover for larger players taking some much-deserved profits. Wallet Growth Continues as Retail Investors Enter the Market During the last month, the Bitcoin network has seen meaningful expansion, with 50,000 new wallets to show for it. The really interesting part? Almost all of these new wallets belong to smaller Bitcoin holders, which means that our engagement with the cryptocurrency continues apace. The retail sector, in particular, can be said to be showing some enthusiasm for this digital currency, with many of us building our positions. Just how many of us? Well, the number of wallets holding less than 0.1 BTC has swelled by about 37,390. Bitcoin has rebounded back above $90K as prices have been rollercoastering here in March. There are 50K more wallets on the network than there were a month ago. By size, there are: 37,390 MORE wallets holding less than 0.1 $BTC 12,754 MORE wallets holding 0.1 – 100 $BTC … pic.twitter.com/xClRIGa4Rj — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 5, 2025 At the same time, Bitcoin’s accounts have been on the rise. Yet, it is critical to specify which types of accounts have been growing fast and which have not. For instance, wallets with at least 100 BTC in them have not been growing at all. In fact, in the last couple of weeks, six fewer wallets have been counted as having 100 or more BTC. In contrast, wallets with 0.1 to 100 BTC in them have grown by a whopping 12,754. And it’s a very safe bet that this is a sign, not of profit-taking, but of accumulation. The relatively slow growth of large wallets could signal that caution prevails among big investors. They may be trying to lock in profits as they watch Bitcoin’s rollercoaster of a price chart. Still, one has to wonder whether there might be some renewed bullishness in the market if the number of these larger wallets is also on the rise. After all, the price breakout and the breakout in the number of large wallets could be seen as a positively correlated event. Profit-Taking from Large Wallets Signals Caution Even as the number of small and mid-sized Bitcoin wallets has grown—an indicator of increased grassroots engagement with the digital currency—worries about the behavior of bigger wallets have mounted. Ample data exists to indicate that, since the establishment of a new bear market in early 2018, the ranks of small and medium-sized wallets have continued to balloon. Despite the rally and recovery seen in the overall Bitcoin market since the beginning of this year, the number of wallets containing 100 or more BTC has only seen a slight uptick. This suggests that the big guys are either not engaging much with BTC at current levels or are locking in profits post-surge. Profit-taking by major holders of Bitcoin might look like a natural, even healthy, development. Bitcoin has been exceedingly volatile in recent weeks, and the larger your Bitcoin wallet, the more sensitive you are to these kinds of market swings. We haven’t seen this kind of extreme in either direction for a long time. And when the price of an asset has been anything but stable, the urge to take profits when you can hardly gainsays human nature. If markets calm somewhat and these large wallets can muster the nerve to add to their holdings instead of trimming them, that will be a sign that the buoys are out again and a more stable Bitcoin price could be in our future. Regardless of these profit-taking steps, the entire market is still perking up. Overall, things seem to be going in a good direction. At least they’re going better than they were going, which was in a downward direction. Bitcoin is right up there leading the pack in terms of price points to pay attention to, right along with the usual suspects that always seem to come up (like Amazon, Google, etc.) when talking about investments. Most eyes, meanwhile, are watching to see if the cryptocurrency can reclaim the $97,000 price point. If #Bitcoin $BTC reclaims $97,000, it could gain momentum for a move toward $150,000, according to the Pi Cycle Top indicator! pic.twitter.com/yok308t4Jy — Ali (@ali_charts) March 6, 2025 Bitcoin ETF Outflows and Market Sentiment Besides the activity seen in Bitcoin wallets, the total amount of funds in institutional investments seems to be on the move as well. On March 5, the total net outflow from Bitcoin spot ETFs was recorded at 38.2958 million US dollars. This figure could be a reflection of the recent price volatility having a more direct influence on investor sentiment. Due to the direct affinity spot ETFs have with the price of Bitcoin, not to mention the more indirect link they have with the price of the cryptocurrency’s underlying asset, these recent moves (or lack thereof) could speak volumes about the kinds of concerns and opportunities Bitcoin is currently presenting to potential investors. On March 5, the total net outflow of Bitcoin spot ETF was 38.2958 million US dollars, and the total net outflow of Ethereum spot ETF was 63.3202 million US dollars. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 6, 2025 The outflow might signal that institutional investors are growing warier, perhaps forecasting that prices will correct or consolidate in the near term. But the overall narrative in the Bitcoin market seems as bullish as ever, with the cryptocurrency’s many long-term proponents remaining quite optimistic. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin While Bitcoin persists in its attempts to break through crucial price levels, the next few weeks might be very important for its market cycle to determine which way the price goes. If less wealthy Bitcoin holders continue to accumulate the price-stressed asset, and if the well-to-do on the blockchain start to add to their positions once more, we could see the price of Bitcoin committing to the kind of uptrend that gets a lot of people talking about it again. Though the wallet count is rising and large investors are giving mixed signals, the number of wallets is a generally positive sign. The big investors’ profit-taking could put a damper on Bitcoin’s growth but their returning to the market could see it blasting off toward $150,000. The state of the market is cautious optimism.

If it is profitable for us, let’s do it. We have excess electricity. Let them make this cryptocurrency and so on”. Belarus has an excess energy supply resulting from the upgrade of the nuclear power plant with a second power unit in May 2023. The country is also considering a second nuclear power plant. Shortly after Lukashenko formed his new government, he started investigating ways to mine cryptocurrency from excess energy. One priority of his new government is to optimise the country’s 5,700-kilometre grid. “The most important thing”, said Lukashenko, “is to upgrade the power grid infrastructure taking into account the growing demand for electricity from households and the economy”. Belarus could imitate the Kingdom of Bhutan, which has excess hydropower energy. The country has dedicated 100 megawatts to Bitcoin mining and is considering another 500 megawatts to boost its mining capabilities. The government currently holds a Bitcoin reserve of around $1 billion. Viktor Karankevich, the previous energy minister, announced in December 2023, that cryptocurrency mining was popular in the country, with Chinese and Russian mining businesses bursting with popularity, and the Belarus power grid was robust enough to handle the increase in demand. Lukashenko mentioned recent developments in America regarding attitudes toward crypto, especially President Trump’s new crypto reserve and plans to boost the mining business in America. “Moreover, you see the path the world is going, especially the largest economy in the world. They announced yesterday that they will keep in reserve,” said Lukashenko. “Therefore, there will be demand for them. Well, maybe we should do it ourselves. Well, we attract some investors, sell them electricity, although I do not rule it out. But we need to do it ourselves. There are such proposals. I think that you will step over this bureaucracy and report what needs to be done.” Daniel Batton, environmental researcher, claims that Bitcoin mining makes the energy sector more sustainable. After reviewing scientific literature on the topic, he concludes that Bitcoin mining opens up opportunities that increase the likelihood of using green energy methods and reducing the carbon footprint of energy companies, a likely result when Bitcoin mining uses excess energy on the grid. The war in Ukraine, however, has halted foreign investment in Belarus’ cryptocurrency mining. Lukashenko has been an ally of Russia’s Vladimir Putin and has suffered from sanctions imposed by Western countries against Russia and Belarus. The first nuclear plant in Belarus started running in June 2021, providing an abundance of energy that could be used for crypto mining. The reactor has a 1,100 megawatt capacity. A second reactor would therefore add another 1,100 megawatts to the grid. Russia finances both reactors.",Bitcoin|News|belarus|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|REGULATION|FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-07 07:39:17

41271100,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137907,1741333224,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Concerning $36M Ethereum ETF Outflows: Decoding the Investor Sentiment Shift,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-etf-outflows-investor-sentiment/,"The cryptocurrency market is ever-evolving, and recent data regarding U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs has sparked considerable discussion. On March 6th, these investment vehicles experienced a notable shift as they collectively recorded significant net outflows. Let’s delve into the details of these Ethereum ETF outflows and what they might indicate about the current market sentiment. Decoding the $36.32M Spot Ethereum ETF Net Outflows According to insights shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net outflow of $36.32 million on March 6th. This figure represents the combined effect of investor activity across various crypto ETF offerings in the United States. While the crypto market often sees fluctuations, such a consolidated outflow day warrants a closer examination. What exactly happened, and which ETFs were most affected? Here’s a breakdown of the ETFs that experienced outflows: Fidelity’s FETH: Led the pack with a substantial net outflow of $25.88 million. BlackRock’s ETHA: Followed with a net outflow of $10.44 million. Interestingly, the remaining spot Ethereum ETF products in the U.S. market reported neither significant inflows nor outflows on the same day. This concentration of outflows in Fidelity’s and BlackRock’s ETFs raises questions about specific factors influencing investor decisions regarding these particular funds. Why the Exodus? Potential Factors Behind ETF Net Outflows Understanding why investors might pull out funds from Ethereum investment products is crucial. Several factors could be at play: Profit Taking: After periods of potential gains in Ethereum’s price, some investors might choose to secure profits by withdrawing their ETF holdings. This is a common practice in volatile markets like cryptocurrency. Market Volatility and Uncertainty: The crypto market is known for its volatility. Increased uncertainty, perhaps due to regulatory news or broader economic factors, can lead investors to reduce their exposure to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, triggering ETF net outflows . Shifting Investment Strategies: Institutional and retail investors constantly reassess their portfolios. Outflows from Ethereum ETFs could be part of a broader shift in investment strategy, possibly towards other asset classes or different crypto investments. Specific ETF Performance Concerns: While less likely given the broad market movement, it’s possible that investors had concerns specific to the performance or management of FETH and ETHA, leading to the concentrated outflows from these funds. Broader Market Correction: Outflows could be symptomatic of a wider correction in the crypto market, where investors are de-risking across various crypto assets, not just Ethereum. Spot Ethereum ETF Landscape: A Quick Recap Spot Ethereum ETFs represent a significant step in the accessibility of cryptocurrency investments. They allow investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the digital asset. Key benefits of these ETFs include: Accessibility and Convenience: ETFs are easily accessible through traditional brokerage accounts, simplifying Ethereum investment for a wider audience. Regulation and Security: Operating within regulated frameworks, ETFs offer a layer of security and compliance that direct crypto ownership might lack. Diversification: ETFs can be a tool for portfolio diversification, allowing investors to allocate a portion of their assets to crypto without managing wallets or private keys. However, challenges and considerations remain: Management Fees: ETFs come with management fees, which can impact overall returns compared to direct crypto holding. Tracking Error: While designed to track the price of Ethereum, ETFs might experience slight deviations, known as tracking error. Market Volatility Impact: Despite the ETF structure, the underlying asset (Ethereum) remains volatile, and ETF performance will be directly influenced by these market swings. Actionable Insights: Navigating Ethereum ETF Investments For investors monitoring Ethereum ETF outflows and considering their next steps, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on market trends, ETF flow data, and broader crypto news. Platforms like Coinglass provide valuable ETF flow information. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different asset classes and within the crypto space can mitigate risk. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky. Ensure your investment decisions align with your personal risk tolerance and financial goals. Consider Long-Term Perspective: Short-term ETF net outflows might be noise in the larger picture. Focus on the long-term potential and fundamentals of Ethereum and the broader crypto market if you believe in its future. Due Diligence on ETFs: Before investing, thoroughly research different crypto ETF options, considering factors like expense ratios, tracking history, and fund management. Conclusion: Interpreting Ethereum ETF Signals The $36.32 million net outflow from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on March 6th is a noteworthy event. While it’s essential to avoid knee-jerk reactions to a single day’s data, these figures serve as a reminder of the dynamic nature of the crypto market and investor sentiment. By staying informed, understanding market dynamics, and maintaining a balanced perspective, investors can navigate the exciting yet volatile world of Ethereum investment and crypto ETFs effectively. The key takeaway is to view such events as data points in a larger narrative, informing a well-rounded and strategic approach to crypto investing.

In terms of on-chain activity, there’s nothing really negative to point to. There are some positive developments, in fact, that some analysts are excited about. I mean, take a look at this screenshot I got earlier today, showing the Ethereum network’s number of unique addresses. You can see the number has gone parabolic lately. And if you look at that ‘over 10,000 ETH’ line, in particular, those figures are really something to behold. Ethereum’s Strong Whale Activity Amid Waning Sentiment Ethereum addresses that hold more than 10,000 ETH have achieved a new milestone, totaling 919. The recent growth in these kinds of addresses suggests that not just individuals but also institutions see Ethereum as a worthy investment. That said, even with these significant investments, Ethereum’s price has continued to languish. Institutional and individual whales, holding these amounts of ETH, are often viewed as long-term holders. They don’t appear to be panicking; instead, they seem likely to hold and maybe even accumulate in the event of further market downturns. The number of addresses holding more than 10,000 #Ethereum $ETH has reached 919! pic.twitter.com/Mis2B3chkz — Ali (@ali_charts) March 6, 2025 Even though substantial activity in large wallets could be viewed as a clear bullish signal for Ethereum’s price in the short term, the prevailing sentiment surrounding the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is anything but bullish. If anything, the crypto community’s sentiment has plunged into the depths of despair. On what seems like an almost daily basis now, bears are congregating across various media platforms to voice just how long and painful the Ethereum price decline might get. And frankly, the Ethereum price has been underperforming when compared to other major assets likes Bitcoin, which has seen recent significant price rebounds. Yet, this overwhelming pessimism may not be such a bad thing after all. Many seasoned cryptocurrency investors argue that times of pronounced negativity often offer a contrarian indicator. When social media and investor sentiment turn especially sour, it has historically marked the moment when an asset not only stops going down but also reverses and starts back up. For those able to withstand the market storm battering us now, there may be an opportunity to accumulate Ethereum at a lower price than we’ve seen in a while. Ethereum sentiment has declined to year-low levels as the asset has underperformed relative to other top caps. For those patiently holding their $ETH , the bearishness being projected across social media is a good sign of a potential turnaround once crypto markets stabilize. pic.twitter.com/iRaKTvb0Tu — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 6, 2025 Ethereum ETF Outflows Reflect Market Caution Ethereum has recently seen not only shifts in sentiment but also some activity that is not so favorable for it. On March 5, Ethereum’s spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) bled a net $63.32 million. This appears to be a pretty strong figure in terms of projecting a less-than-stellar sentiment. It seems to be suggesting that some institutional players whose money is managed in these vehicles are reducing their exposure to Ethereum. On March 5, the total net outflow of Bitcoin spot ETF was 38.2958 million US dollars, and the total net outflow of Ethereum spot ETF was 63.3202 million US dollars. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 6, 2025 Several factors could explain the outflow, including the underperformance of Ethereum and the bearish sentiment affecting the market. Institutional investors often use spot ETFs as a vehicle to gain exposure to an asset without making a direct investment. They prefer these funds because they are as liquid and as regulated as the cash and cash-equivalent investments that institutional investors usually hold. Outflowing funds likely indicate that investors are either reducing their exposure to risky assets or reallocating their portfolios to other investments that seem more attractive. This recent ETF outflow for Ethereum represents, in the short term at least, a loss of investor confidence. But ETF flows can be super volatile, and a big chunk of this outflow could just be the reaction of a few investors to some pretty wild market moves. If Ethereum can capture some upward momentum (and it has outperformed Bitcoin of late), there is a solid chance that it will be back in the institutional interest game. Looking Ahead: Patience Could Pay Off for Ethereum Holders Even though optimism has recently taken a hit, with ETFs pulling out of Ethereum, there are still reasons to be hopeful about ETH’s future. For one, big wallets packed with plenty of Ethereum show that some key players are confident in the asset. Also, the way Ethereum is currently being talked about on social media and in investor circles suggests that it’s not far from hitting a bottom—an inflection point where long-term holders might want to do some buying. The development of Ethereum is proceeding well; the way is being paved for the kinds of decentralized applications (dApps) that people might actually use. That scenario is beginning to play out on the platform. Anyway, DeFi seems here to stay, and all those dApps using DeFi components are still part of the Ethereum “internet of things” scenario. My principal investment vehicle for expressing a long-term, bullish view on Ethereum is the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which I will discuss below. Individuals who currently possess Ethereum and have seen its price drop are likely not feeling good about their situation. But if these individuals are long on Ether and believe in its fundamental value, this could be an ideal time to purchase more Ether, as its price is currently low. When purchasing any cryptocurrency, like Ether, one should always ensure that such a purchase makes sense economically and financially, based on one’s individual or household circumstances. To conclude, although Ethereum has lately been battered by some strong headwinds, the rise in the number of large holders, the potential for a market turnaround, and the sustained development of the Ethereum network all suggest that the current market pessimism may be short-lived. Most likely, the Ethereum holders who remain patient and keep an eye on the long-term horizon will, in the end, see something akin to a reward in whatever recovery the market makes—this future being, of course, contingent on Ethereum’s maintaining its adaptability and its (with some notable exceptions like EOS) ongoing presence in the lead pack of blockchain platforms.

The founder of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, and Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency trading firm, was once a prominent figure in the crypto industry. His charisma met a dark end when the fraud committed by his organisation was exposed. On March 28, 2024, he was sentenced to over 25 years in prison , three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $11 billion in forfeiture for his orchestration of multiple fraudulent schemes. This is our side of the story. Recently, in an interview with Tucker Carlson, he opened up about his side of the story. Don’t miss this!

Notably, although Bankman-Fried joined the interview virtually from prison, Carlson showed no hesitation to ask tough questions. The interview covered a wide variety of topics, from bankruptcy to life in prison. Undoubtedly, the statements he made about bankruptcy and political contributions are likely to trigger serious discussions in the crypto sector. Bankman-Fried Still Regrets Declaring Bankruptcy From his statements, it is clear that he does not believe that declaring bankruptcy was a wise decision. He claimed that if FTX had continued operating, it would have $93 billion in assets today. He even boasted that there was enough money to pay back users. This indicates that he does not think he committed any fraudulent activities. Sadly, there was no sign of remorse in his words. It is clear that he is keen on giving a political angle to his imprisonment. Bankman-Fried’s Political Contributions and Changing Views Earlier, Bankman-Fried was an ardent supporter of the Democratic Party. In 2020, his huge financial contributions to the party gained significant media attention. In the previous interview, he stated that he privately supported the Republican Party too. He also claimed that his decision to support the Republican Party played a key role in the collapse of his organisations. In his recent interview with Carlson as well, he asserted that his disillusionment with the Democratic Party led to his downfall. Bankman-Fried’s Appeal Efforts and Future Outlook In his first interview from prison, Bankman-Fried indirectly appealed for a pardon from US President Donald Trump . The Trump administration has not yet considered this appeal. Interestingly, in the latest interview, he showed no interest in appealing for a pardon.

They just minutes ago announced major increases in position with $MOVE, as well as considerable bolstering of their holdings in $WBTC and $ETH. This is very much in line with WILFI’s strategy to prepare for not just a bear nor bull market, but a series of volatile crypto market conditions over the next couple of years. New Acquisitions and Diversified Portfolio WLFI’s recent moves show its commitment to diversifying its investments in crypto. The firm has picked up 3.42 million $MOVE tokens, worth about 1.45 million USD. That’s part of a broader trend of trying to find investments with tremendous growth potential. In tandem with purchasing $MOVE, WLFI also grabbed 110,595 $WBTC tokens, worth around 9.95 million USD. At the same time, the firm added 4,468 $ETH to its holdings, worth about 9.96 million USD. Together, these moves suggest that WLFI is doubling down on some of the cryptocurrencies it’s already invested in and going across the board in the major space. By focusing heavily on both Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are often seen as gorgeously stable pillars in the digital asset space, WLFI has made these decisions. WLFI’s most recent acquisitions have pushed its total investment in cryptocurrency to an astounding 309 million USD, spanning a total of nine diverse tokens. The firm has demonstrated an unmistakable passion for putting money to work in crypto, even as that market has experienced some seriously turbulent times. Some of our own writers have gone so far as to advocate for viewing those price fluctuations as awesome entry points. And they’re not wrong. Active Portfolio Adjustments Amid Market Volatility The investment moves taken lately by WLFI in the digital currency market couldn’t come at a better time. This is because, in the last 24 hours, a number of the tokens that WLFI has invested in have seen not just good, but significant price increases. And those tokens include $AAVE and $ONDO, which this morning had price shifts that were right in line with the kind of movement that these two tokens typically make when they are about to break out and head higher. According to the last update, WLFI’s cumulative floating loss has reduced to $80.96 million, a marked gain from their previous losses. This shift is driven by the appreciation in the value of certain assets—like $AAVE and $ONDO—that have helped reduce the overall unrealized losses in WLFI’s portfolio. The recent uptick in asset values has thus served to narrow the cumulative floating loss, which is now more than half replaced by the returns that have come since the last update—amounting to a narrow gain and certainly a more favorable number for WLFI to report. 浮亏 8783 万美金？无所谓，总统自会使用「钞能力」 5 小时前特朗普 WLFI 一把增持了价值 2500 万美金的三种代币 – $MOVE ：342 万枚，约 145 万美金 – $WBTC ：110.595 枚，约 995 万美金 – $ETH ：4468 枚，约 996 万美金 至此，WLFI 已累计花费 3.09 亿美金主动购入 9 种代币；因 AAVE / ONDO… https://t.co/WRHs1iMk4o pic.twitter.com/IJzhWr76zy — Ai 姨 (@ai_9684xtpa) March 6, 2025 Of all the tokens in WLFI’s holdings, one standout is $TRX, the native token of the TRON blockchain. In the face of a tough market, $TRX has done a complete turnaround for WLFI, moving it from an unrealized loss up to a profitable position. Even with all the changes in the market, WLFI remains confident in the long-term vision of its held assets, like $TRX. This is a victory lap for $TRX within WLFI’s portfolio, and it does speak to the adaptability of WLFI as a firm. If nothing else, this is a nice thing to have in a portfolio while everything else seems to be crashing. Strategic Vision for the Future Recent investments by WLFI are a clear sign of the firm’s interest in taking strategic steps toward its future growth. In just the past week, for example, it invested in two different kinds of tokens: one very well-established ($WBTC) and the other still kind of new and uncertain ($MOVE). This sort of unfolding interest shows a couple of things: WLFI is building a portfolio of investments that cover a good range of both stable and kind-of-up-in-the-air digital assets. Over the next few months, WLFI is likely to continue making shifts that reflect its overarching approach of taking full advantage of key trends and market turns. The firm has shown a remarkable knack for going with the flow (or against it, when necessary) of the market, making it a player of note—if not significant—in the cryptocurrency investment world. As the market continues to mature, we believe that WLFI’s not-too-profile investments in such central assets as $ETH and $WBTC position it well for whatever the future has in store. In addition, WLFI’s active involvement in the cryptocurrency arena indicates that the firm may be on the lookout for even more ways to swell its coffers as conditions change in the crypto marketplace. That buying and holding of digital assets by WLFI could allow the firm to make some serious profits in the not-too-distant future also is suggested by the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency prices. Conclusion WLFI’s recent $25 million investment in $MOVE, $WBTC, and $ETH clearly shows their commitment to cryptocurrency as a long-term investment strategy. With a diversified portfolio and a keen eye for market trends, WLFI’s actions reflect a strong belief in the future growth potential of these key cryptocurrencies. Even as the crypto market continues to face serious headwinds, WLFI seems firmly positioned to remain a significant force, making strategic decisions that all but ensure its success in the years ahead.

The reserve will consist of Bitcoins seized by the government, and will not purchase BTC outside of these. White House cryptocurrency advisor David Sacks, who revealed details about the Bitcoin reserve, stated that the reserve will be funded by Bitcoins seized by the government through criminal or civil asset forfeiture and therefore will not impose any additional cost on taxpayers. According to Arkham data, the US government currently has 198,109 BTC in its wallet worth approximately $17 billion. However, not all of these BTCs belong to the US. The US may have a reserve of 88 thousand BTC, excluding the BTCs from Bitfinex. Galaxy Digital Research President Alex Thorn said in a post on his X account that the US government has approximately 198,000 BTC, but only a maximum of 88,000 BTC (43% of its holdings) can be used as reserves. Thorn stated that the remaining 112,000 BTC will be returned to the Bitfinex Exchange. As you may recall, Bitfinex lost 120,000 BTC in an attack in 2016, and the US government seized some of these funds. Finally, drawing attention to the US government’s sales, Lookonchain said that the US government previously sold approximately 222,684 BTC (worth around $3.28 billion at the time, and around $19.42 billion today) to Coinbase, Coinbase Prime, and other unknown wallets for an average price of $14,736. Accordingly, the US government lost approximately $16.14 billion at current prices by pre-selling BTC. we think current US bitcoin balance available for re-purpose into a reserve is max 88k BTC, only 43% of current government holdings. that’s bc of the ~198k BTC now held by USG, 112k BTC will be returned to bitfinex market will learn the difference between “seized” & “forfeited” — Alex Thorn (@intangiblecoins) March 7, 2025 *This is not investment advice.

South Korea is stepping into the spotlight, actively exploring the introduction of spot crypto ETFs . This exciting development, driven by global trends, could unlock new avenues for digital asset investment in the nation. Are you curious about what this means for the future of crypto in South Korea and beyond? Let’s dive in! South Korea Crypto ETF Exploration: Why Now? South Korea’s renewed interest in crypto ETFs isn’t happening in isolation. It’s a direct response to the growing global wave of acceptance and adoption of these financial instruments. Recent discussions at the National Assembly on March 7th, involving key figures from the ruling People Power Party (PPP), government bodies, and private sector experts, signal a serious consideration of this topic. This move underscores a proactive approach to align with international financial innovations. Why is this exploration so significant? Consider these key factors: Global Trend Following: The success and increasing popularity of spot Bitcoin ETFs in other regions, particularly in the United States, have likely spurred South Korea to re-evaluate its stance. Ignoring these trends could put South Korea at a disadvantage in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. Investor Demand: There’s a growing appetite among South Korean investors for regulated and accessible crypto investment products. ETFs provide a familiar and regulated framework, potentially attracting a broader range of investors into the crypto market. Economic Opportunities: Embracing crypto ETFs could stimulate economic growth within South Korea by attracting capital, fostering innovation in the financial sector, and positioning the country as a forward-thinking hub for digital assets. [img src=”image-placeholder.jpg” alt=”South Korea Crypto ETF Exploration”] Understanding Cryptocurrency Regulation in South Korea The discussion around crypto ETFs in South Korea is deeply intertwined with the nation’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation . Historically, South Korea has navigated a complex path, seeking to balance investor protection with fostering innovation. While there have been periods of strict regulations, the current exploration of ETFs suggests a potential shift towards a more accommodating stance. Kwon Seong-dong, floor leader of the PPP, highlighted the crucial need for a balanced regulatory framework. His emphasis on analyzing global trends and avoiding both excessive restrictions and lax oversight points towards a nuanced approach. This balanced approach is critical for creating a healthy ecosystem for digital assets to thrive while safeguarding investors. Here’s a quick look at some key aspects of South Korea’s regulatory considerations: Investor Protection: A primary concern for regulators is ensuring adequate investor protection within the volatile crypto market. ETFs, being regulated investment vehicles, could offer a layer of security and transparency compared to direct crypto ownership. Market Stability: Regulators need to assess the potential impact of crypto ETFs on market stability and prevent illicit activities. Robust regulatory frameworks are necessary to mitigate risks and maintain market integrity. Taxation and Compliance: Clear guidelines on taxation and compliance for digital assets , including ETFs, are essential for both investors and the industry to operate effectively within the legal framework. Investment Trends and the Global Crypto ETF Surge South Korea’s move to explore crypto ETFs is undeniably influenced by prevailing investment trends and the global enthusiasm surrounding these products. The successful launch and performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, for example, have demonstrated the potential of these instruments to attract significant capital and mainstream adoption. Globally, we are witnessing a clear shift in sentiment towards digital assets. Institutional investors are increasingly showing interest, and retail investors are seeking easier and regulated ways to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies. Crypto ETFs bridge this gap by offering a traditional investment vehicle for a novel asset class. Consider these global trends: Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions worldwide are warming up to cryptocurrencies, with some even launching their own crypto-related products and services. Retail Investor Access: Crypto ETFs democratize access to cryptocurrency investment, making it easier for everyday investors to participate without needing to navigate the complexities of direct crypto ownership and storage. Diversification Benefits: For many investors, digital assets are seen as a valuable diversification tool, and ETFs provide a convenient way to incorporate them into a portfolio. What are the Potential Benefits of Crypto ETFs in South Korea? Introducing crypto ETFs in South Korea could bring a range of advantages, benefiting both investors and the broader financial ecosystem: Increased Market Liquidity: ETFs can boost liquidity in the South Korean crypto market by attracting more trading volume and capital inflows. Enhanced Investor Access: Crypto ETFs would provide a more accessible and regulated avenue for South Korean investors to participate in the cryptocurrency market, potentially attracting those who were previously hesitant due to regulatory uncertainties or complexities. Legitimacy and Mainstream Adoption: The introduction of ETFs can further legitimize cryptocurrencies as an asset class and accelerate mainstream adoption within South Korea. Competitive Financial Market: By embracing financial innovation, South Korea can enhance its competitiveness in the global financial market and attract investment and talent. Challenges and Considerations for South Korea While the exploration of crypto ETFs is promising, South Korea must also carefully consider potential challenges and navigate complexities: Regulatory Framework Development: Establishing a robust and clear regulatory framework specifically for crypto ETFs is crucial. This includes addressing issues like custody, valuation, and market surveillance. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. Regulators need to implement measures to manage risks associated with ETF products linked to such volatile assets. Public Awareness and Education: Ensuring public awareness and investor education about the risks and opportunities associated with crypto ETFs is essential for responsible adoption. International Collaboration: Given the global nature of crypto markets, international collaboration and coordination on regulatory standards and best practices will be beneficial. Actionable Insights: What to Watch For For those keenly following the developments in South Korea and the broader crypto landscape, here are some actionable insights: Monitor Regulatory Announcements: Keep a close watch on announcements from South Korean regulatory bodies and government officials regarding crypto ETFs . Any policy changes or statements will be crucial indicators. Track National Assembly Discussions: Follow discussions and debates within the National Assembly related to digital asset regulation and crypto ETFs . This will provide insights into the direction of policy-making. Observe Global ETF Performance: Analyze the performance and market impact of existing crypto ETFs in other regions, particularly in the US and Europe. This can offer valuable lessons and benchmarks for South Korea. Engage with Industry Experts: Stay informed by engaging with crypto industry experts, analysts, and commentators who are closely tracking South Korea’s crypto regulatory landscape. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for South Korean Crypto? South Korea’s exploration of crypto ETFs marks a potentially pivotal moment for its cryptocurrency market. Driven by global trends and a growing recognition of the potential of digital assets, this move could reshape the investment trends in the nation and solidify South Korea’s position in the evolving global financial landscape. While challenges remain, the commitment to a balanced regulatory approach signals a promising future for digital assets and cryptocurrency regulation in South Korea. Keep watching this space – the journey of crypto ETFs in South Korea is just beginning, and it promises to be an exciting one!

41271380,https://nulltx.com/?p=146731,1741333847,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Ethena Unveils Major $ENA Unlock, $741M in Tokens Released",https://nulltx.com/ethena-unveils-major-ena-unlock-741m-in-tokens-released/,"A significant event in the cryptocurrency market occurred yesterday when Ethena , a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) project, unlocked a phenomenal 2.07 billion $ENA tokens. This represents a huge uptick in deposits to our major trading partners. To look at this rationally, the unlocked tokens (less than 45% of which are registered in exchange wallets) represent about 39.17% of the $ENA tokens in circulation; so people were naturally concerned. Bear in mind, though, that just 25% of the unlocked tokens are supposed to have any effect on the $ENA price, and only when they are used in trading. Oh, and also remember: to look at this rationally. According to @Tokenomist_ai , #Ethena unlocked 2.07B $ENA ($740.71M, 39.17% of the circulating supply) yesterday. In the past 2 days, 12 wallets deposited 125M $ENA ($45M) to #Binance , #Bybit and #FalconX . pic.twitter.com/q4zimVjwI4 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 6, 2025 Massive Token Movement to Major Exchanges The recent unlocking of $ENA comes during an uptick in activity around the token. Since late last week, a number of wallets and addresses have begun transferring and depositing large amounts of $ENA into major centralized exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and FalconX. In just the last two days, 12 different wallets have made sizable deposits of $ENA totaling around 125 million tokens, worth an impressive $45 million, onto those platforms. Concerns are emerging, meanwhile, among investors that all this $ENA hitting the market could create some serious downward price momentum. In the last 18 hours, the multi-signature wallet of Ethena Labs has been very lively indeed, transferring a colossal 94.16 million ENA tokens—worth around $33.7 million—to no fewer than 33 different addresses. These serial movements appear to form part of a much larger planned release of ENA tokens, some 2.07 billion of which are expected to be unlocked over a not-to-distant horizon. The wallet distributing these ENA tokens to so many different places obviously raises a gigantic question mark over the project’s tokenomics. These transfers are remarkable for their sheer scale and for involving major players in the process. It appears that a lot of the freshly unlocked $ENA tokens are making their way to a handful of concentrated exchanges and wallets, which sets us up for some short-term price action. Key Players and Distribution of $ENA Among the recent recipients of transfers of $ENA, two names stand out for their size and significance. OKX Ventures, the investment arm of leading exchange OKX, received a hefty 17.87 million $ENA tokens. This is a substantial and strategic move in terms of securing a foothold in a project like Ethena and suggests that OKX, as a major player in the crypto space, may have future intentions to engage with Ethena or its ecosystem. Alongside OKX Ventures, Michael Egorov of Curve Finance received 2.8 million $ENA tokens. Egorov is a well-known name in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and one that adds to the credibility of $ENA and the Ethena project in terms of their potential and future success. Both OKX Ventures and Michael Egorov have deposited their $ENA tokens on Binance, indicating that these tokens might soon be available for trading or could be employed as liquidity. Given their excellent track record and deep involvement in DeFi, the presence of either one of these high-profile individuals could have a meaningful impact on the near-term trajectory of $ENA’s price and its position in the broader crypto market. Market Reactions and Price Dynamics Currently, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or Binance have been given a total of 59.3 million $ENA tokens worth approximately $21.08 million. The average price of these tokens has been at $0.355, according to Dune Analytics. However, this average price seems to indicate that market participants are selling. They seem to be selling because they expect the large supply of newly unlocked tokens to depress the price. And in fact that’s what seems to be happening. In the past 18 hours, @ethena_labs ' multi-sig transferred 94.16M $ENA ($33.7M) to 33 addresses, likely part of this week's 2.07B $ENA unlock ($741M, 39.17% of circ. supply). So far, 59.3M $ENA ($21.08M) has been sold on DEXs or sent to #Binance at an average price of $0.355.… pic.twitter.com/IULgQBJCbj — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) March 6, 2025 The $ENA token’s distribution, especially over such a short span of time, might well create some price volatility as the tokens find their proper value in the market. But, really, the situation is not as dynamic as it might first seem. The multi-sig wallet from which these funds are being distributed holds actually quite a bit of $ENA. And that put together with the half billion tokens in the reserve wallet means the price dynamics that underpin the $ENA scene are pretty stable. The Road Ahead for $ENA and Ethena Labs As we move ahead, the continued distribution of $ENA tokens looks set to prompt a number of market reactions as investors process all those new tokens. And while we fully expect Ethena’s long-term game plan to kick in soon and stabilize things, for the time being, there’s no sugarcoating what’s likely to happen to the $ETHENA price when investors see a new torrent of tokens being dumped on them. As $ENA gets into the hands of more investors and prominent market players, its future will almost certainly pay homage to the stock trading laws of supply and demand. Lots of newly unlocked tokens might flood the market. The next few weeks will tell if Ethena can bolster investor confidence enough for $ENA to withstand that onslaught. If the price holds up, that might very well be a good sign. If, on the contrary, the price and the market behave in a manner reminiscent of the express elevator scene in “The Tower of Terror,” that also might be a good sign in the sense that it doesn’t seem like the price is dramatically unfurling any flags of investor confidence. To sum up, the Ethena project and its investors find themselves at a crucial juncture with the release of 2.07 billion ENA tokens locked up for two years. High-profile venture capitalists got involved, and now a significant quantity of the tokens is heading for cryptocurrency exchanges. What could happen next? Well, the project could become more volatile, or we could see a breakout. The crucial thing here is how Ethena manages itself at this new stage in its life cycle.

The secretary defended Trump’s policies, saying the president was trying to transition the economy to a private sector-powered one. Speaking at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent commented that President Donald Trump was trying to transition the public sector-powered economy to a private sector-powered one. Bessent highlights the need to reprivatize the economy US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent revealed Trump’s administration’s plan to unleash private sector growth and address the previous administration’s mistakes. He pointed out that the government was cutting unnecessary spending under Trump’s leadership. Bessent added that Biden’s administration’s overregulation stifled innovation within the United States. Amid all the excitement and news today, I almost forgot I had the opportunity to hear @USTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s remarks at @EconClubNY this afternoon. One of my takeaways: Bessent said that to start fixing the economy and the mistakes of the last administration,… pic.twitter.com/4ztdeeJByp — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) March 7, 2025 The secretary highlighted that permanent tax cuts, reduced corporate rates, and expanded small business deductions would be paired with deregulation to lower costs and boost investment. He said suspending the Corporate Transparency Act would ensure millions of small businesses were freed from burdensome reporting. In his first economic policy address, Bessent commented that the US economy’s reliance on the public sector for job growth was stunted. The government official was vocal about Biden’s administration’s overspending, saying its policies led to increased inflation. He explained that the Biden administration left the US with an economy that may have exhibited some reasonable metrics at face value but was brittle. He explained that 95% of all job growth in the past year was concentrated in public and government adjacent sectors. Bessent said these jobs offered slower wage growth and less productivity than private-sector jobs. He reiterated that the private sector had been in rescission, and their goal was to reprivatize the economy. The official pointed out that employment in manufacturing, information technology, and mining flatlined over the same period. The Secretary said Trump’s administration was working to create more jobs in the private sector. He added that some measures the president implemented to achieve this included extending tax cuts, slashing regulations, and rebalancing the United States economy through tariff policies. Bessent comments on Washington’s trade tariffs Bessent dismissed the tariff concerns, saying they were necessary for long-term stability and to create America’s first competitiveness. He defended the White House’s position on tariffs, saying Trump was ready to take strong measures to achieve his trade goals. The government official emphasized that trade policy had to be more than acquiring low-priced items from other countries. He said that access to cheap goods was not the essence of the American dream. Bessent added that the American dream was rooted in the concept that everyone could access economic security and upward mobility. He added that previous administrations have lost sight of the dream when it comes to multilateral trade deals. He emphasized that the government would respond when other countries’ policies harmed the United States economy and its citizens. Bessent clarified that this was America’s first trade policy. Commerce Department data revealed how far the United States fell behind its global trading partners. It highlighted the imbalance, which increased to H$131.4 billion in January, a 34% increase from December 2024. Bessent commented that he was not worried about inflation across the continuum. He explained that Trump considered tariffs to have three benefits, including protecting industries and workers from unfair practices. The government official added that the tariffs would also act as a source of revenue for the United States. He also emphasized that Trump would use the tariffs as a negotiation tool. The Treasury secretary predicted that Trump’s economic agenda would help reduce interest rates and increase market confidence in the long-term U.S. fiscal profile. Canada and Mexico responded to the trade tariffs, saying they were unfair and unreasonable. Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would remain in a trade war with the United States for the foreseeable future. He added that his government would continue discussing with Trump’s administration to seek the tariff removal. The prime minister noted that Canada’s reciprocal tariffs would remain in place until Washington withdrew theirs. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

After seeing a high at around $2,500 in early February, the price of ETH has tried to backtrack a few times but has continued to fall closer to its last low of around $2,050—a price not seen since November 2023. As the asset continues to price flip-flop, we have been using on-chain data to gain some additional insights into just how and why investors have been moving in and out of the asset during these last few weeks. Ethereum’s latest Cost Basis Distribution analysis reveals a dynamic capital movement across price levels and distinct investor behavior during this period. It shows that lower prices have not led to large market participants accumulating more ETH, clearly demonstrating that our previous thesis of “accumulation below $3K” was misguided. In fact, having ETH approach the $2K price point now looks like a price floor. Moreover, investors who initially acquired ETH at significantly higher prices seem to have sold into the recent rally. But in contrast to what much lower prices might otherwise suggest, having ETH not only previously accumulate but now look to have a price floor seems to have led to more selling. Key Investor Activity Amid Market Shifts Now, if we focus individually on each of the aforementioned three months, the allocation from the first month shows us that investors—who conducted their initial ETH purchases at or around the $3,500 price point—engaged substantially with both the local peak of $2,500 and also during the retracement to $2,050. During February, these ETH holders took advantage of the strategic buy situations. More importantly, they were also able to up their market-making game by lowering their exposure during the dip in a strategic buy moment of their own. All said and done, they now hold approximately 1.75 million ETH with an average cost basis of about $3,200. This positions management underlines a trend of Ethereum investors choosing risk-aware strategies. Many investors haven’t just sat around waiting for the market to do its thing; they’ve worked the market, using its fluctuations to help reduce their exposure to a price that’s seeming a bit too high for comfort. Besides indicating a possible top in the market, this also suggests Ethereum investors are getting better at tuning in to the market’s signals—for better or worse. At approximately 500,000 ETH at $2,200 on March 1, investors seized upon near-the-lower-end price movement to make the kind of accumulation that’s been the hall-mark of Ethereum investor action during this recent volatile period. The immediate subsequent movement in assets was up again in price, lighting up some kind of overvaluation radar, as it happens, that’s been the counterpoint to the kind of market dip-buying we’ve been talking about since the early part of this year. And as for the selling-as-overvaluation-signals market behavior? Can’t say we’re too surprised to see it being practiced by none other than Ethereum investors. Under the investor radar, Ethereum dips have been good buying opportunities. They seem to have netted gains on immediate term moves since. #Ethereum investors actively managed their exposure through this volatile period. After a rally to $2.5K, $ETH retraced to $2.05K – levels last seen in Nov 2023. Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) shows how capital rotated across price levels and who took advantage of the dip. pic.twitter.com/vl6AdghfRO — glassnode (@glassnode) March 5, 2025 Resistance Levels and Key Price Points to Watch Later, when I look ahead, the price levels around $2,800 have emerged as a crucial resistance point for Ethereum. On-chain data reveals that around 800,000 ETH has been accumulated at or near this price level, signaling a significant supply zone where selling pressure could increase should the price rise back toward these levels. This resistance zone will likely serve as a key point to watch during any potential recovery, as it could either mark a temporary ceiling for the price or serve as a launching pad for further gains if it is breached. The pile-up at $2,800 shows that a large chunk of investors have purchased ETH at that price, and as we get nearer to that price again, these folks might be more likely to sell than to buy, thus exerting downward pressure on Ethereum’s price, as these investors seek to pocket the profits that would seem to be theirs at $2,800. In effect, this situation creates a double bind: either ETH is stuck under $2,800, or it goes significantly past that price and somehow manages to hold. The actions of investors at reduced price levels continues to pique interest, though. Why? Because it’s one thing to be a buy-and-hold investor when the price is going up and quite another to not freak out when you see the price pull back. Accumulating, in this case, 500,000 ETH at $2,200 and then not freaking out when it was $1,900 but OMG WOWING it back at $2,500 and now at $3,500 is kind of an impressive feat of emotional stability. But it also raises two questions: Why are these not-very-affluent investors buying during downturns and then selling during upswings? And how is it that sell orders for these supposedly profit-taking trades seem to coincide with price increases? Long-Term Outlook for Ethereum While the wider cryptocurrency market is blowing hot and cold, Ethereum stays close to the center. Consequently, its price is what most of us are looking at, and not just us plebeians, but also the big boys in the space (or what passes for “the big boys” in this still-nascent industry). Unlike a year or so back, when lots of folks talked up Ethereum’s being the next bitcoin, Ethereum seems to have settled back to being a cryptocurrency that does lots of interesting stuff, while the price just kinda hovers. In the near term, not just the actions of investors but also the conditions in the overall marketplace—such as regulation, the adoption of Ethereum 2.0, and the growth of DeFi—will determine how Ethereum’s price performs. If Ethereum can move above and maintain key resistance levels including and especially around $2,800, it can continue to shape its upward price trajectory. To sum up, Ethereum investors are showing a high level of engagement and strategic positioning during this turbulent period of price action. They are actively adjusting their exposure and capitalizing on the price swings to try to reduce their initial cost basis and set themselves up for potential future gains. They have eyes on the key price levels that Ethereum is approaching, including the $2,800 resistance, and in this ongoing price action of the cryptocurrency market, many are looking to see what happens next with Ethereum.

Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s tranche of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.67, meaning that there are slightly more call (long) contracts expiring than puts (shorts). Moreover, open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, remains high at the $120,000 strike price, which is $1.4 billion, according to Deribit. There is also over $1 billion in OI at the $100,000 and $110,000 strike prices. Bearish sentiment is also seeping back as $750,000 in OI currently sits at the $80,000 and $70,000 strike prices. Crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live said the group was still “predominantly bearish,” adding that traders were “anticipating further downside while experiencing frustration with extreme chop and volatility.” It added that most traders were watching the $87k to $89k range as key resistance, with $82k noted as a recent bottom, “though there is significant disagreement on whether a sustainable bottom has been found.” “Market experiencing extreme price swings with Bitcoin moving $6k in a day, creating what traders describe as ‘scam both ways’ price action.” Bitcoin OI by expiry. Source: Deribit Around 223,000 Ethereum contracts are also expiring today, with a notional value of $482 million and a put/call ratio of 0.71. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $3 billion. “Trump tariff announcements (and subsequent reversals) are contributing to market confusion, with many traders sitting out due to unpredictable price action,” Greeks concluded. Spot Market Tanks Markets have been extremely volatile over the past 24 hours, with total capitalization dumping around $200 billion following Donald Trump’s executive order for a strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Bitcoin tanked almost 6%, falling from above $90,000 to $85,000 in less than an hour before it bounced off to $88,000. The response came as White House crypto czar David Sacks said the reserve would be capitalized by BTC already seized by the US government. Retail took this to mean the US would not be buying any more BTC for its SBR and dumped the asset. However, the small print states that the Treasury and Commerce secretaries have been directed by Trump to find “budget neutral” ways to acquire BTC. Nevertheless, crypto markets remain in the red this Friday morning.

Gox Transfers 11,834 BTC to New Wallet Amidst Growing Speculation",https://nulltx.com/mt-gox-transfers-11834-btc-to-new-wallet-amidst-growing-speculation/,"In a move that has caught the cryptocurrency world by surprise, Mt. Gox, formerly one of the largest and most infamous Bitcoin exchanges, has transferred an astounding 11,834 BTC (around $1.07 billion at the current price) into a new wallet. This transfer—Mt. Gox’s first major move in over two months—has naturally led to a great deal of speculation about what could be in store for the now-defunct Bitcoin exchange and its creditors. Creditors have been waiting for a long time now to hear what could be going on with a resolution to the bankruptcy proceedings. The latest major development with the exchange, in any case, raises the question: Is this the first sign that Mt. Gox could finally be moving toward a resolution? A Significant Move After Months of Inactivity The last significant thing Mt. Gox did in the world of cryptocurrency was on December 24, 2024. Aside from that day, it has been fairly quiet. So, when it made headlines in early March 2025, people paid attention. And for good reason: what it did was transfer an immense sum of Bitcoin—over $1 billion worth, to be precise. To some analysts and enthusiasts, this is just the latest bizarre twist in the ongoing story of Mt. Gox, a formerly top-tier Bitcoin exchange that has been in bankruptcy since 2014. Even though it was one of the earliest and most prominent Bitcoin exchanges before its 2014 collapse, Mt. Gox has stayed an enigma in the crypto world. Where most exchanges have either shut down or gone into bankruptcy over the last nearly 10 years (200Euros, Cryptsy, etc.), Mt. Gox has carried on with winding up in a way that resembles the winding up of a scam. Nevertheless, with the 11,000+ BTC still held by Mt. Gox as a ghost asset, many in the crypto world have continued to speculate on what might become of those BTC. Mt. Gox transferred 11,834 $BTC ($1.07B) to a new wallet an hour ago, likely as part of an internal move! Notably, between November 1 and December 24, 2024, Mt. Gox transferred a total of 8,820 $BTC (~$760M) to #B2C2 Group. Currently, Mt. Gox still holds 24,245 $BTC ($2.19B)… https://t.co/ngA1qrNNan pic.twitter.com/40BnBPWQOM — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) March 6, 2025 The first large-scale movement of funds from Mt. Gox in two months is obviously significant. The timing and size of the transfer have, therefore, been closely watched and have prompted several theories among observers of the situation. One theory has it that this recent transfer was an attempted test prior to a larger fund movement. Another theory suggests that the funds were actually transferred to the creditors of Mt. Gox. Mt. Gox’s Recent Transactions and Holdings From November 1 to December 24, 2024, B2C2 Group, a major liquidity provider in the cryptocurrency realm, received total transfers of 8,820 BTC from Mt. Gox. The equivalent roughly to $760 million at the time, this earlier transfer to B2C2 Group marked the first major transaction in a larger series undertaken by the exchange in the fall of 2024 with the intent of liquidating its remaining holdings and settling outstanding liabilities. The most recent transfer of 11,834 BTC further increases the total amount of Bitcoin moved in recent months. This brings the total sum of Bitcoin that has been transferred from Mt. Gox in the past few months to approximately 20,000 BTC (around $1.83 billion). However, Mt. Gox still holds a substantial stash of 24,245 BTC (valued at approximately $2.19 billion), remaining one of the largest Bitcoin holders in the world. The amount of BTC still in Mt. Gox’s possession has been a topic of constant speculation. Although the exchange’s asset liquidation has progressed significantly, a large amount of BTC still remains. The bankruptcy negotiations have been long and winding, overdue despite their complexity, and sometimes delayed by too many lawyers in too many rooms for comfort. No one really knows how long this is going to take—but tt seems likely that the way forward will be cleared only by a combination of resolution in the negotiation room and resolution in court. The Road Ahead for Mt. Gox Creditors Currently, the destiny of the leftover Bitcoin stored at Mt. Gox is up in the air. The exchange’s creditors, a good many of whom seem to be living in an era more like 2014 than 2023, keep a close watch on this slow-moving situation because they have been promised that this, at long last, will yield something resembling a payback. And creditors will be very much in the spotlight when, and if, this tale of woe reaches any kind of conclusion. Beyond that, it isn’t clear why anyone should care. Mt. Gox’s trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi, has been urged time and again to speed up the payout process. But overcoming the myriad of obstacles impeding the payout—obstacles that include legal and technical issues—that’s been like trying to get blood from a stone. A recent transfer of Bitcoin into a new wallet, for example, has not changed the payout timeline in any way that’s immediately noticeable. So consider it a reminder, if you need one, that the Mt. Gox saga isn’t over yet. For the investing public, the activity at Mt. Gox should serve as a cautionary tale about the risks and complexities of putting money into digital assets. It is becoming increasingly clear that whatever happens next in the Gox saga—it appears that lawyers for the exchange will be seeking clarity on certain still unsettled legal issues—will have huge ramifications not just for the crypto community but also for the many people who used to trade on the exchange. The question now seems to be not if creditors will be made whole but rather when that will happen. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

41271714,https://nulltx.com/?p=146727,1741334359,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Evolution of Token Release Strategies: Q1 2024 vs. Q1 2025,https://nulltx.com/evolution-of-token-release-strategies-q1-2024-vs-q1-2025/,"The cryptocurrency market might be maturing, but it’s far from settled. How tokenomics are evolving is a good symbol of this inevitable march toward a new order. And because this new order is still taking shape, it allows us to discern several key trends simply by looking at new project release schedules. What are these trends? What kinds of release strategies are new projects adopting? What implications do they have for market liquidity, long-term sustainability, and investor strategies? Let’s dig in. Higher Initial Unlocks in 2024, Gradual Emissions in 2025 The difference that stands out the most when comparing tokens launched in Q1 2024 with those from Q1 2025 is the initial unlock structure. When looking at early 2024 tokens, you see a much higher first-year emissions number relative to the 2025 tokens. When you look at the 2024 tokens, most of them release more than half of their total supply in the first year. That certainly seems to reflect an aggressive market entry. For example, XAI shines with a remarkable 69.77% of its overall supply made available to the market in the first year post-launch. Other tokens, such as ONDO and ETHFI, also feature significant first-year unlock percentages, with 57.53% and 56.79%, respectively, but none come close to the XAI percentage. This rapid emission strategy — and it is a strategy — is almost certainly aimed at driving early liquidity and adoption and incentivizing potential users to take a look at the offering post-launch. The strategy may very well be a direct response to competitive pressures. In contrast, in an aggressive unlocking strategy, tokens are made available in such large volumes that it creates a risk of volatility. Such was the case with MATIC during its first year of availability. Having just launched at a price of $0.0025 in May 2019, MATIC shot up in value to $0.10 in June and then, even more significantly, to $0.26 by September 2019. However, in the latter half of its first year, MATIC was in the unfortunate position of being strongly correlated with a downtrending overall crypto market, which in turn was impacting many individual projects. By contrast, the tokens introduced in the first quarter of 2025 are taking a considerably more cautious approach. Many of these tokens are following slower, more controlled emission schedules that stress long-term sustainability over immediate liquidity. Their first-year unlocks tend to be much lower, reflecting a contrasted choice for the tokens—or their creators, at least—in favor of longer vesting periods before full access. Consider BIO and ANIME: their first-year emissions are only 15.60% and 25.49%, respectively, a big step down from the kind of levels we were seeing in last year’s batch of tokens. Despite this overall trend toward slower emissions, certain 2025 tokens, such as BERA (56.89%), seem to have more aggressive unlock schedules. Nevertheless, this appears to be more the exception than the rule. Shift Toward Controlled Emissions in 2025 Tokens An emerging trend from the comparison is a noticeable shift in token release strategies between 2024 and 2025. The former emphasized immediate liquidity and high first-year unlocks. The latter, however, seems to favor a more gradual and sustainable emission strategy. This shift is likely a response to the challenges faced by early-stage projects with aggressive unlock schedules. Tokens released in Q1 2025 appear to be adopting a much more balanced approach to emissions that extends beyond the first year. For instance, a number of projects, such as LAYER and KAITO, distribute their emissions evenly across several years, which provides a much smoother and far more predictable release schedule. This layout should, in theory, help avoid the kind of sell pressure that can occur when a token appears to be unlocking in huge amounts all at once. And while some projects that started in 2025 also seem to be adopting a staggered release strategy, several others, like BIO, IP, and KAITO, appear to be distributing their emissions evenly across a number of years and well into Year 5. Emissions decline sharply in most token models following Year 1. For instance, JUP released 36.73% of its supply in the first year, but then that dropped all the way down to 0%. ETHFI was slightly better in that respect. After the first year, it released a not-so-breath-taking 7.53% in the third year, after having released 56.79% in the first year. So far, in the first couple of years of existence, these tokens have been creating a fair amount of price pressure in the market. They’ve even been leading to a certain amount of price instability. The reason is that if you’re a JUP or an ETHFI holder, what incentive do you have to hold it when you know that almost all of the supply is eventually going to be released, and the price is way more unstable than it might otherwise be? How are token release strategies evolving? By comparing Q1 2024 vs. Q1 2025 tokens, we can uncover key trends in emissions and their market impact. Key Findings: – Higher First-Year Unlocks for 2024 tokens – More Gradual Emission Trends for 2025 tokens – Sharp Declines in… pic.twitter.com/6tNM0FJ0Y9 — Tokenomist (prev. TokenUnlocks) (@Tokenomist_ai) March 5, 2025 Looking Ahead: A More Sustainable Approach This transition to a more gradual emission and long-term unlock strategy signals a shift in the tokenomics of new projects. The pressure first-year emissions put on short-term prices—and the volatility these emissions have caused—are clear lessons learned from past tokens. These tokens tend to do better over the long haul if they don’t have a first-year price chart that looks like this (insert chart). So if emission schedules are supposed to produce tokens that retain more value over time, what do those in 2025 look like? For investors and traders, understanding these changing release strategies is crucial for making informed decisions. Tokens with slower, more controlled emissions offer more predictable market behavior, while those with rapid unlocks might offer significant short-term gains but at the cost of higher volatility. As the market matures, this evolution in release strategies could lay the groundwork for tokens which are more sustainable in appearance, and whether they actually are or not, that token projects will offer sustainable growth instead of the unsustainable hype that precedes a downturn. To sum up, the difference between the tokens of Q1 2024 and the tokens of Q1 2025 shows that projects are now following a better tokenomics approach. Projects in Q1 2025 are following more sustainable emission patterns that will provide reliable initial liquidity without immediately flooding the market with tokens. This trend, if it continues, could serve as a decent blueprint for the next bull phase. Emphasis is obviously now on long-term viability and stability.

Various analysts suggest that the flagship’s crypto performance could “go either direction” depending on the White House crypto summit’s outcome. Related Reading: Stellar (XLM) Price Setting Up For Rally To $1.60 – Here Are The Levels To Watch Bitcoin Price To See Volatile Friday Over the past two days, the crypto market has recovered from this week’s lows ahead of the US crypto summit. Last Friday, news that US President Donald Trump would host the first-ever White House crypto summit filled investors and industry participants with bullish expectations. Scheduled for March 7, several high-profile figures will attend the event, including Strategy’s Michael Saylor, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, and Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev. Since Tuesday, Bitcoin’s price has surged around 9% from the $81,500 support to surpass the $90,000 barrier, but some market watchers have warned investors about the expected volatility for Friday’s crypto summit. Analyst Altcoin Sherpa noted that Bitcoin “doesn’t have much clarity on higher timeframes” despite retesting its post-November breakout range and holding the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Sherpa suggested holding the $89,000 support is key for BTC’s price as the crypto summit’s volatility leaves “all options on the table.” He added that the crypto market will likely “whipsaw in both directions” this Friday. Meanwhile, trader Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that Bitcoin’s current levels are worth watching over the next few days, as it “is still struggling to hold on to the range, but bears have also failed a further breakdown after the initial rejection.” Nonetheless, he considers that the crypto summit is a “very promising sign for the next 4 years,” regardless of the outcome: It’s something we couldn’t have dreamt of the past few years. With the industry being attacked on a regular basis. Let’s hope the focus will be on the right things and that the administration is choosing the right way to do things. BTC Recovery Targets Surge To $140,000 Analyst Crypto Jelle affirmed that “things are developing well, but it all hinges on the crypto event on Friday.” He noted that an underwhelming event could trigger another sell-off, as there aren’t other potential bullish catalysts on the horizon. Jelle also advised investors “Don’t get too excited until we get some more clarity.” However, he highlighted a Potential Power of 3 (PO3) forming on BTC’s chart, targeting $140,000 “once range lows are successfully reclaimed.” This pattern divides the price cycle into three distinctive phases. In the first phase, accumulation, the price consolidates near the recent high following strong price action. The second phase, manipulation, consists of a token’s price falling below the previous phase’s support level and trading within a range below this zone. The third phase, distributions, sees a strong price breakout, building momentum and driving participants to enter the market. Related Reading: Ethereum Price ‘Between Heaven And Hell’: $2,000 Level Retest Key For ETH’s Next Move According to the post, Bitcoin is “pushing for the reclaim” of the post-November breakout’s lower range. Holding through the $90,000-$92,000 zone “would trigger the power of three set up” third phase, which would see BTC’s price expand to new highs. After today’s rejection from the $90,000 range, the analyst signaled that Bitcoin could form a higher low around $87,500 before retesting the range lows again. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $88,372, a 1.3% drop in the daily timeframe.

41271706,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137899,1741334425,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Will U.S. Bitcoin Reserves Trigger Global FOMO?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-bitcoin-reserves-global-fomo/,"Are you ready for a potential seismic shift in the global financial landscape? Imagine a world where nations scramble to accumulate Bitcoin, driven by the fear of being left behind. This isn’t just crypto speculation; it’s a scenario being seriously discussed by experts. Matthew Pines, Executive Director of the Bitcoin Policy Institute, believes the United States holding strategic Bitcoin reserves could be the catalyst for a worldwide phenomenon: global FOMO . Why U.S. Bitcoin Reserves Could Ignite Global FOMO The concept of strategic Bitcoin holdings by a nation-state, especially one as influential as the United States, carries significant weight. Pines’s statement, made in a recent Bitcoin Magazine interview, highlights a critical dynamic. Here’s why U.S. involvement in Bitcoin reserves could trigger widespread global FOMO : Legitimacy and Validation: When the U.S. government, a global superpower, starts treating Bitcoin as a strategic asset, it sends a powerful message. It validates Bitcoin as more than just a speculative digital currency. This move can signal to other nations that Bitcoin is a serious contender in the future of finance. Fear of Being Left Behind: Nations constantly compete for economic and geopolitical advantage. If the U.S. is perceived to be gaining an edge by holding Bitcoin reserves , other countries may feel compelled to follow suit to avoid being left behind in a potentially Bitcoin-dominated future. This is the core of global FOMO in this context. Geopolitical Implications: Strategic Bitcoin holdings can be seen as a new form of geopolitical power. Countries with Bitcoin reserves might be perceived as more financially resilient and independent, especially in a world increasingly questioning the dominance of traditional financial systems. Scarcity Amplification: Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins is a fundamental aspect of its value proposition. As nations begin accumulating Bitcoin reserves , the available supply in the open market decreases, potentially driving up demand and further fueling global FOMO . The Bitcoin Policy Institute: Shaping the Narrative on US Bitcoin Policy To understand the context of Pines’s statement, it’s crucial to know about the Bitcoin Policy Institute. This nonprofit organization plays a vital role in shaping the discourse around US Bitcoin policy . Their mission is to conduct in-depth research on Bitcoin’s policy implications and its broader impact on society and emerging monetary networks. By focusing on factual analysis and reasoned arguments, the Bitcoin Policy Institute aims to: Educate Policymakers: Provide unbiased research and insights to policymakers to help them understand Bitcoin and its potential. Promote Sound Bitcoin Policy: Advocate for policies that foster innovation and responsible growth in the Bitcoin ecosystem within the U.S. Foster Public Understanding: Increase public awareness and understanding of Bitcoin’s societal and economic implications through research and educational initiatives. The Bitcoin Policy Institute’s work is essential in navigating the complex landscape of US Bitcoin policy and ensuring informed decision-making at the governmental level. Strategic Bitcoin Holdings: Benefits and Challenges The idea of strategic Bitcoin holdings by nations is not without its complexities. Let’s explore both the potential benefits and challenges: Benefits of Strategic Bitcoin Holdings Benefit Description Diversification of Reserves Bitcoin offers a decentralized, non-sovereign asset that is uncorrelated with traditional markets, providing diversification beyond gold and fiat currencies. Hedge Against Inflation With its limited supply, Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflation, potentially preserving national wealth in times of economic uncertainty. Enhanced Financial Independence Holding Bitcoin reserves can reduce reliance on traditional financial systems and potentially offer greater financial autonomy. Technological Leadership Embracing Bitcoin can position a nation as a leader in the burgeoning digital asset space, attracting innovation and talent. Challenges of Strategic Bitcoin Holdings Challenge Description Volatility Concerns Bitcoin’s price volatility can be a concern for national reserves, requiring robust risk management strategies. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for Bitcoin is still evolving globally, creating uncertainties for nations holding it as a reserve asset. Security and Custody Securely storing and managing large Bitcoin reserves requires specialized expertise and infrastructure to prevent theft or loss. Public Perception and Political Will Gaining public and political support for holding Bitcoin reserves might be challenging due to misconceptions and lack of understanding about cryptocurrency. Examples of Bitcoin Adoption and Potential Future Trends While the U.S. hasn’t officially announced strategic Bitcoin holdings , other nations and entities are already making moves in the Bitcoin space. El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender is a prominent example. MicroStrategy, a publicly traded company, has also amassed significant Bitcoin holdings as part of its corporate treasury strategy. Looking ahead, we might see: Increased Institutional Adoption: As regulatory clarity improves and institutional infrastructure matures, more corporations and investment funds could allocate capital to Bitcoin. Sovereign Wealth Funds Exploring Bitcoin: Nations with sovereign wealth funds might start considering Bitcoin as a component of their diversified investment portfolios. Central Banks Researching CBDCs and Bitcoin: Central banks are actively researching central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Simultaneously, some may explore the potential role of Bitcoin within the broader financial ecosystem. Actionable Insights: Preparing for Potential Global Bitcoin FOMO Whether or not global FOMO for Bitcoin materializes, understanding the potential implications is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in US Bitcoin policy and global regulatory trends in the cryptocurrency space. Educate Yourself: Learn about Bitcoin’s fundamentals, technology, and economic principles to make informed decisions. Consider Diversification: Explore how Bitcoin and other digital assets might fit into a diversified investment portfolio, considering your risk tolerance and financial goals. Engage in Dialogue: Participate in discussions about Bitcoin policy and its societal impact to contribute to a more informed and balanced public discourse. Conclusion: The Dawning Era of Strategic Bitcoin? Matthew Pines’s assertion about US Bitcoin reserves triggering global FOMO is a provocative yet plausible scenario. As the world grapples with evolving financial systems and geopolitical uncertainties, Bitcoin’s role is becoming increasingly significant. Whether nations rush into strategic Bitcoin holdings remains to be seen, but the conversation is undoubtedly shifting. The Bitcoin Policy Institute and similar organizations are playing a crucial role in shaping this narrative, urging for informed and strategic approaches to Bitcoin policy. The potential for global FOMO serves as a stark reminder of Bitcoin’s growing influence and the urgent need for understanding its implications on a global scale.

In a recent post on March 7, Carter praises Trump’s decision to create a Strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) Reserve, saying the announcement “couldn’t have gone better.” Carter, known for his investigative articles exposing the Biden administration for their efforts to snuff out the crypto industry, highlighted a few positive things that he believes came out of the White House Crypto Summit held on March 7. According to Carter, it was a good move on the Trump administration’s part to clearly set the strategic Bitcoin reserve apart from the altcoin stockpile rather than merging the two together or treating them the same way. Meanwhile, he suspects the decision to buy other altcoins will be left to the Congress. “Bitcoin gets official USG [U.S. government] seal of approval, no other coin does,” Carter explained. Instead of going up after Trump’s Bitcoin Strategic Reserve reveal, the asset has actually gone further down. At press time, Bitcoin has fallen by nearly 4% in the past 24 hours of trading. BTC has slipped well below the $90,000 threshold, dangling just under $89,000. It is currently trading hands at $88,362.

Echoing the words of AI and crypto czar David Sacks’ announcement after the White House Crypto Summit, Carter said not using taxpayer funds means there won’t be public backlash towards the reserve. In a separate post , he jokingly suggested that if Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto turns out to be someone from the National Security Agency and he has around 1 million BTC kept in Fort Meade, then Trump’s executive order would make sure those funds are never sold. After the White House Crypto Summit on March 7, David Sacks declared that President Trump has signed an executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. According to Sacks, the U.S. government currently holds around 200,000 BTC in seized assets, though a full audit has not been conducted.

However, after President Donald Trump announced changes to the proposed crypto strategic reserve, speculation is rife over whether this summit will crash Ripple, Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana prices. With the crypto market already showing signs of weakness, traders should expect more volatility. Here’s why: Why Ripple, Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana Prices Could Crash After the Crypto Summit The highly anticipated White House crypto summit is happening today, and crypto prices are crashing. Ethereum dropped by 6% to trade at $2,170 at press time. XRP price also recorded a marginal 1.3% drop to trade at $2.51, while Solana dipped by nearly 5% to $143. Cardano price saw the second-biggest losses among the top ten largest cryptos with a 7% loss to trade at $0.87. The four altcoins saw a brief rally earlier this week after they were included in President Trump’s plan for a crypto reserve. However, a recent change of plans shows that the US government is not willing to buy any of these altcoins. In a recent statement, the White House said that the government will establish a separate Bitcoin strategic reserve and a separate digital assets stockpile that will include XRP, ETH, ADA and SOL. However, the government will not buy any coins for this stockpile. Instead, it will include only seized assets. Digital Assets Stockpile If Trump does not outline clear plans on how this digital assets stockpile will be constituted, it could crash prices after the crypto summit. Bitcoin Reserve News Already Priced In Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, and Solana prices will also likely crash after the summit as the news of a Bitcoin reserve has already been priced in. These altcoins have been tracking BTC price, and if Bitcoin fails to make strong gains, altcoins could trade lower after the crypto sumit. Moreover, crypto prices are unlikely to rally after this summit due to a lack of plans to buy BTC for the strategic reserve. Crypto czar David Sacks stated that the US government holds nearly 200,000 BTC seized by law enforcement agencies, which will be included in the reserve. However, there are no clear plans on how to fund additional reserves. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve As Bitcoin price continues to struggle, it is likely that top US altcoins will also crash after this crypto summit. However, as traders close their positions and market expectations reduce. It could lead to a more natural price action. Cardano Price Crashes as Hoskinson Likely to Miss Crypto Summit According to crypto reporter Laura Shin, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has not been invited to the White House Crypto Summit. This has led to a bearish Cardano price forecast after ADA posted the biggest loss among the other four cryptos that are part of the digital assets stockpile. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is attending the summit . However, besides Hoskinson, Ethereum and Solana co-founders Vitalik Buterin and Anatoly Yakovenko have so far not been included. This could see crypto prices crashing after the summit. What’s Next for Ripple, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano Prices? Ripple, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano prices are likely to crash after the crypto summit. This is becayse market expectations that the US government will buy these altcoins for a crypto reserve are dropping. However, Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett has hinted at possible changes to crypto tax laws . She noted that during the crypto summit, there could be “some kind of tax announcement.” This could fuel gains for XRP, ETH, SOL, and ADA prices.

High-profile founders or leaders can find themselves at the center of the community’s attention, for better or worse. And how closely community members pay attention to these figures can often serve as a good proxy for how close the community is paying attention to the markets themselves. Take the chart above, for instance. It details the all-time mentions of various crypto founders across a variety of platforms, from X (formerly Twitter) to Bitcointalk. And while you might not find a direct line between mentions and actual price movements, it’s definitely the case that the more these figures get talked about (for good reasons or bad), the label “cryptocurrency” starts operating much like an “Internet stock” from 1999. The Founders Who Dominate Social Media Conversations The chart draws attention to the 10 crypto founders who receive the most mentions. Each of these individuals has had a pronounced effect on the cryptocurrency market, with some making technological advancements that seem almost miraculous, while with others, well, they’re just in the news a lot, for reasons that are not always flattering. 1. Satoshi Nakamoto: Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic and nameless creator of Bitcoin, is at the top of the crypto community’s list of luminaries. The founder of the first blockchain-based currency is, in my estimation, the most important figure in the cryptocurrency universe today even if—perhaps especially if—he’s not taking calls. Nakamoto’s handiwork (if we may assume that it is handiwork) is on display (even if virtually now) whenever the Bitcoin scene blows up. His name is the top-name driving Bitcoin-related optimism and FOMO whenever new Bitcoin- or blockchain-related innovations see the light of day. 2. Do Kwon: Co-founding Terra (LUNA) and UST with a character like Do Kwon makes it clear that there are people in this space with highly controversial tendencies. Kwon has often been debated in the community, especially following the 2022 collapse of Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin. Billions in funds that investors had poured into Terra seemed to vanish overnight, and many pointed fingers at Kwon for the disaster. Condemnation of Kwon’s character isn’t ever far off from the sentiment of this community, and depending on which side of the finger pointing one hears, mentions of Kwon can lead to some volatility. 3. Vitalik Buterin: One of the most revered personas in the crypto world, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum and the mastermind behind the smart contracts on which its decentralized financial system operates, is a regular mention in conversations about decentralized finance (DeFi) systems, NFTs, and upgrades to the Ethereum network. When he speaks or shares news about the platform he’s helped build, it’s generally regarded in the market as a positive thing that tends to push prices upward. 4. Justin Sun: A flashily marketed persona known for penny auctions, high-profile partnerships, and mega-million dollar stunts that beg comparison to P.T. Barnum, as in: who really is Justin Sun? He is likely to make headlines from time to time, for good or ill, which will, in turn, color the perception of Tron and its currency. If you are Tron-aware, and if you have considered the antics of Sun and his affiliate, then you have a handle on this variable. Bumping up Tron’s visibility in your alt-list makes it a more speculative investment. 5. Sam Bankman-Fried: The fall of Sam Bankman-Fried, the ex-CEO of FTX, has left a long scar on the crypto world. His exchange’s implosion in 2022, resulting in criminal charges and an ongoing financial scandal, is still the talk of social media. Bankman-Fried gets mentioned a lot when fresh developments occur in his legal circumstance or when the FTX collapse’s ripple effect hits something else in the market. You could say he symbolizes the negative side of an overly fast-paced and underregulated crypto world. His name is very often associated with talk of market dips, especially when those dips are blamed on FUD. 6. Roger Ver: An early investor in Bitcoin and the principal backer of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Roger Ver is known for his clear and pointed views about Bitcoin’s scalability problem. With the ongoing support that Ver gives to Bitcoin Cash and its larger block sizes, you would think that he was trying to create and maintain a controversy in order to garner attention for BCH. Ver’s pro-scaling Bitcoin Cash and anti-scaling Bitcoin Cash puts the BCH community hot on the trail of accusations concerning building a tunnel for BCH to march down. 7. Ryoshi: The elusive founder of Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ryoshi, who passed into the mist of anonymity after launching one of the most successful meme coins of all time, still holds a prominent place in crypto legend. Of course, SHIB’s many pumps and the rabid community that supports it often keep Ryoshi’s name on people’s lips. When bursts of FOMO hit the project, it’s usually because the community has just pushed it to another all-time high, which often happens in 2022 during meme coin market rallies. 8. Charles Hoskinson: Co-founding Ethereum and creating Cardano (ADA) make Charles Hoskinson one of the major forces behind blockchain technology. For a long time now, he has been pushing for a kind of development he calls “scalability”—those changes to blockchain architecture that allow it to grow and serve more users without being slowed down in its fundamental operations. His name comes up quite a bit in discussions of various solutions for achieving that end and of the endowments of delegated autonomy they confer upon users (decentralized governance). 9. Charlie Lee: Litecoin (LTC) developer Charlie Lee remains a crucial figure in the cryptocurrency scene. His work on Litecoin, a faster and more efficient alternative to Bitcoin, means he is name-checked in any number of discussions about technical advancements or new partnerships in the space. Lee often bubbles up to the surface during the periods of interest that alternative cryptocurrencies can generate—interest that sometimes contributes to price movements for LTC. 10. Changpeng Zhao: The largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, Binance, was founded by Changpeng Zhao. Zhao has played a vital part in molding the global crypto market. He is an executive who is frequently mentioned in the news—obviously, not all publicity is good; some of it pertains to how problematic Binance can be or how liable it is to regulators or other aspects of the law. Still, most of the news is either okay or very good, and that is a huge part of the crypto market. The following chart indicates the all-time mentions of relevant crypto founders according to discussion frequency on X, Reddit, Telegram, 4Chan, Farcaster, and Bitcointalk. These are the top 10: 1⃣ Satoshi Nakamoto: The mysterious figure behind Bitcoin, credited with writing… pic.twitter.com/BHt9fEFwAt — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 5, 2025 The Impact of Founder Mentions on Market Sentiment The chart spotlights not just the names that dominate crypto chats, but also the market’s hypersensitivity to those names. When certain people are trending, the crypto conversation not just pauses, but also pivots. And this chat ain’t in a bubble, because when it kinda seems like certain people’s names are about to fall off the trending charts and into obscurity, that’s when the market actually reacts, in this case, negatively. Comprehending these trends is very important for investors. They can furnish highly valuable revelations into the way social media dialogues and the public’s perception of these important personages can affect price movements and general market volatility.

Crypto asset manager had previously submitted an S-1 registration statement to the SEC for a spot Polkadot ETF on Jan. 31. The March filing is an updated version of that initial application, possibly to address feedback from the SEC or to provide additional information. The filing sees 21Shares join Grayscale, which filed to list a spot Polkadot ETF with the SEC on Feb. 25 through Nasdaq . The Polkadot ETF filings by 21Shares and Grayscale are part of a broader trend where asset managers are increasingly seeking SEC approval for crypto ETFs. 21Shares has also recently filed for ETFs targeting Ripple ( XRP ) and Solana ( SOL ). As for its existing offerings, 21Shares currently offers Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs, as well as a number of exchange-traded products . You might also like: Polkadot price stuck at a key support, pointing to a 170% surge Meanwhile, DOT price appears to have formed a falling wedge pattern on the weekly chart, a bullish reversal setup characterized by lower highs and lower lows converging into a narrowing range. In other words, the distance between highs and lows is decreasing, which means that the rate of decline is slowing. This suggests that sellers are losing momentum, and a breakout could be imminent. If DOT breaks above the local resistance zone of around $10, it would confirm the wedge breakout. The critical support level is around $4, which if crossed, will invalidate the pattern, potentially driving DOT back to the previous major support at $3.60. At press time, DOT is trading at around $4.5, with the 24-hour volume of over $255 million, according to Coinmarketcap . Source: crypto.news In addition to the potential approval of Polkadot ETF by the SEC, DOT price may be buoyed by the launch of Polkadot 2.0 in Q1 of this year, a major upcoming upgrade to the Polkadot network designed to enhance its scalability and developer accessibility. An early testnet version is already available on the Kusama network, allowing developers and users to experience and provide feedback on the new features before the official release.

In a new video, the trader pseudonymously known as DonAlt tells 65,900 subscribers of the TechnicalRoundup YouTube channel that he has not changed his bullish bias on Bitcoin and is still “expecting higher” prices for the flagship crypto asset. “Trend still strong though… [On the weekly time frame] last week, [Bitcoin] wiped below the range and then closed all the way back in it. This is bullish – like that’s a really good close. And then we had this week, we had another wipeout. And so far, that’s kind of been reclaimed as well. So, if this weekly close is above $90,000, I’m going to assume the range is still intact. And given we tested the bottom of the range, wiped out everyone below it, that would be like a bullish setup.” Source: DonAlt/YouTube According to DonAlt, Bitcoin will go much higher if it rallies above the range high of $104,000. The pseudonymous analyst, however, says that Bitcoin appears bearish on the daily and monthly time frame. “Monthly [chart] is not that great… And daily [chart] is really, really interesting here because technically speaking, there’s an excellent short setup here. So basically, you would take a short here [around $90,000], your stops up here [around $95,000]. And then you target like new lows. Like either this [around $78,000] or even like all the way back to $70,000. Like that’s a really good short setup.” Source: DonAlt/YouTube Bitcoin is trading at $87,508 at time of writing.

Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts, because a significant development just dropped. Canary Capital, a well-known crypto investment firm, has taken a major leap by registering an entity for a spot SUI ETF in Delaware, United States. This news, initially reported by BWE News Telegram channel, is sending ripples of anticipation throughout the digital asset community. But what exactly does this mean, and why is it such a big deal for SUI and the broader crypto market? Let’s dive in and explore this fascinating development. What’s the Buzz About a Spot SUI ETF? Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have revolutionized traditional investing, offering a simple and regulated way for investors to gain exposure to various asset classes. In the crypto world, the idea of a Crypto ETF has been a long-sought goal, promising to bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets. A spot ETF is particularly noteworthy because it directly holds the underlying asset – in this case, SUI. Unlike futures-based ETFs which track futures contracts, a spot ETF directly reflects the actual price movements of SUI. This is generally seen as more desirable by investors as it provides more direct and transparent exposure to the cryptocurrency. Think of it this way: Direct Exposure: A spot SUI ETF would allow investors to invest in SUI without directly holding the cryptocurrency themselves. This simplifies the process, eliminating the need for crypto wallets, private keys, and navigating complex exchanges. Regulation and Security: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering a layer of security and investor protection that may be lacking in the often-unregulated crypto space. This could attract institutional investors and those who are hesitant to dive directly into crypto due to security concerns. Accessibility: ETFs are easily accessible through traditional brokerage accounts. This makes investing in SUI as simple as buying stocks, opening up the market to a much wider range of investors who are already comfortable with traditional investment vehicles. Canary Capital Leading the Charge for SUI ETF Canary Capital , the firm behind this exciting move, is not new to the crypto investment landscape. They are known for their strategic investments and forward-thinking approach to digital assets. Their decision to register a spot SUI ETF entity in Delaware signals a strong belief in the potential of SUI and the growing demand for regulated crypto investment products. Delaware is a popular jurisdiction for business registrations due to its business-friendly legal framework, which further adds credibility to Canary Capital’s endeavor. [img src=”image-of-canary-capital-and-sui-logo.jpg” alt=”Canary Capital and SUI Logo”] Why is Canary Capital ‘s involvement significant? Expertise and Reputation: Canary Capital’s established presence in the crypto investment sector lends weight to the SUI ETF application. Their expertise and reputation can instill confidence in both regulators and potential investors. Strategic Vision: Filing for a spot SUI ETF demonstrates Canary Capital’s strategic vision and their anticipation of the evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. They are positioning themselves at the forefront of institutional crypto adoption. Market Impact: A successful SUI ETF launched by Canary Capital could significantly boost the visibility and credibility of SUI, potentially driving further investment and adoption of the SUI network. The Significance of a Spot ETF in the Digital Asset Realm The registration of a spot SUI ETF entity is more than just news for SUI enthusiasts; it’s a significant moment for the entire digital asset investment space. The crypto industry has been eagerly awaiting the approval of spot crypto ETFs in the U.S. for years. While Bitcoin spot ETFs have finally been approved, the expansion to other cryptocurrencies like SUI marks the next phase of crypto’s integration into mainstream finance. Here’s why spot ETFs are crucial for the digital asset market: Feature Spot ETF Futures ETF Underlying Asset Directly holds the cryptocurrency (SUI) Holds futures contracts of the cryptocurrency Price Tracking Directly reflects spot price of SUI Tracks futures price, which can deviate from spot price Investor Appeal Generally preferred for direct exposure and transparency May be less appealing due to indirect exposure and potential tracking errors Market Maturity Signal Stronger signal of market maturity and regulatory acceptance Step towards maturity, but spot ETFs are considered the ultimate goal The Road Ahead for the SUI ETF and Crypto ETFs While the registration of the entity is a positive first step, it’s important to remember that the journey to launching a spot SUI ETF is still in its early stages. The application process with regulatory bodies like the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) can be lengthy and complex. There are several hurdles to overcome, including regulatory approvals, custody solutions, and market surveillance requirements. Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC has been cautious in approving crypto ETFs. Canary Capital will need to demonstrate robust compliance measures and address any regulatory concerns to gain approval for their SUI ETF . Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market remains a concern for regulators. Measures to mitigate risks and protect investors will be crucial. Custody Solutions: Secure and reliable custody of the underlying SUI tokens is essential for a spot ETF. Canary Capital will need to partner with established custodians to ensure the safety of assets. What Does This Mean for You and the Crypto Market? The potential launch of a spot SUI ETF is undoubtedly exciting news for the SUI community and the broader crypto ecosystem. It represents a significant step towards mainstream adoption and could have several positive implications: Increased Demand for SUI: A SUI ETF could drive significant demand for SUI as ETF providers need to acquire the underlying tokens to back the ETF shares. Enhanced Market Liquidity: Increased trading activity related to the ETF could improve liquidity in the SUI market. Broader Investor Base: A SUI ETF would open up SUI investment to a wider range of investors, including institutional investors and retail investors who prefer regulated investment products. Validation of SUI and Crypto: The approval of a SUI ETF would further validate SUI as a legitimate digital asset and reinforce the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within the traditional financial system. Conclusion: A Promising Horizon for SUI and Crypto ETFs Canary Capital ‘s registration of a spot SUI ETF entity is a landmark development that underscores the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency market. While the path to launch may have its challenges, this move signals a strong belief in the future of SUI and the transformative potential of crypto ETFs. As we move forward, the crypto world will be watching closely to see how this exciting journey unfolds.

The EO establishes two main components: a strategic reserve dedicated to Bitcoin and a broader digital asset stockpile that includes other cryptocurrencies. Among the assets considered for this stockpile are XRP, SOL, ADA, and ETH. In the wake of these developments, Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko has expressed concerns about the creation of such a reserve, especially regarding its potential impact on decentralization. Yakovenko recently addressed rumors suggesting that Ripple may have pitched SOL as part of the national reserve in a bid to make the inclusion of XRP more legitimate. Responding to these claims, Yakovenko clarified his position on reserves, stating his preference: No Reserve : “If you want decentralization to fail, you’d put the government in charge of it.” State-Controlled Reserves : He suggested that individual states should run their own reserves to act as a hedge against potential federal mistakes. Objective Criteria for Reserves : If a reserve is necessary, Yakovenko argues it should be based on objective, measurable requirements that are rationally justified. Yakovenko further stressed that the Solana ecosystem would be ready to meet any objective criteria set by a reserve, even if it means focusing on Bitcoin for now. When questioned about whether Solana representatives had pitched SOL for inclusion in the reserve while Ripple pushed for XRP’s inclusion, Yakovenko humorously responded, “What’s a Solana representative? At this point, it’s honestly like saying a Bitcoin representative. No one asked me, and I didn’t pitch it.”",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,SOL|FIAT|BTC|XRP|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-07 08:11:14

Republicans have raised concerns about this issue in recent congressional hearings, highlighting how, in the past, crypto businesses were often excluded from banking services because regulators like the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC didn’t want them in the system, fearing negative consequences for the banks’ reputations. Tim Scott’s FIRM Act To Protect Crypto Tim Scott, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has gathered support from fellow Republicans for the Financial Integrity and Regulation Management Act (FIRM Act). Essentially, the bill would prevent regulators from considering a bank’s reputation as a factor in determining whether it is safe and sound to do business with certain customers, like those in the crypto industry. “It’s clear that federal regulators have abused reputational risk by carrying out a political agenda against federally legal businesses. This legislation, which eliminates all references to reputational risk in regulatory supervision, is the first step in ending debanking once and for all,” said Chairman Scott. Scott was joined on the bill by his fellow Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee, including Sen. Cynthia Lummis. Lummis, who chairs the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets, believes that the U.S. needs clear and transparent rules that support the growth of digital assets (like cryptocurrency) rather than restrict them with excessive government control. “We’re putting these rogue regulators on notice—their days of unchecked power are over,” she added in a statement. “Financial regulators have used ‘reputational risk’ to target people and businesses they don’t like, hiding behind this open-ended and subjective concept,” said Senator Tillis. “The FIRM Act stops this political weaponization and ensures regulators focus on real financial risks, not personal or political agendas. Crypto has found a strong ally in the GOP, especially with President Trump supporting the industry. Trump has also criticized banks for refusing to work with conservatives, adding fuel to the debanking debate.",Uncategorized|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-07 08:12:28

How naming rights could fund the Fed’s strategic Bitcoin reserve,https://crypto.news/naming-rights-could-fund-strategic-bitcoin-reserve/,"Auctioning off naming rights to national landmarks offers a proactive, budget-neutral boost, echoing President Trump’s call to harness digital assets for American prosperity. On March 6, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, a decisive step to make America the “crypto capital of the world,” as outlined in the White House Fact Sheet released today. By designating Bitcoin ( BTC ) a reserve asset — initially funded with 88,000 BTC of forfeited holdings — the order charges the Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce with crafting budget-neutral strategies to acquire more, a move the U.S. deems necessary in its quest for global cryptocurrency dominance. Here’s the text of the Executive Order: ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE AND UNITED STATES DIGITAL ASSET STOCKPILE March 6, 2025 https://t.co/sQXmaW0X11 — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 7, 2025 Enter an audacious yet practical idea: auctioning the naming rights to America’s natural wonders. Picture a “Tether Falls” cascading in Yellowstone, “Lake Binance” lapping where Michigan once stood, or the “Bitfinex Smoky Mountains” rising in Tennessee. This is not mere whimsy — it’s a market-driven path to amass Bitcoin, fulfilling the President’s vision with flair and fiscal discipline. It is a blueprint that exists in sports. Naming rights have long turned stadiums into cash cows without diluting their purpose. The New York Mets’ 20-year, $400 million deal for Citi Field, initiated in 2009, remains the most significant, but the San Francisco Giants’ 2019 contract with Oracle Park is estimated to have an average annual value of $15 million. Additionally, the Texas Rangers’ deal for Globe Life Field in 2017 and the Houston Astros’ agreement for Daikin Park in 2024 are both believed to be generating at least $11 million annually. If corporations pay top dollar to brand a ballpark or football stadium, why not a waterfall, national park, lake or forest? The White House’s mandate for cost-free innovation makes this a natural fit — transforming public landmarks into Bitcoin-neutral acquisition strategies outlined by the latest Executive Order. You might also like: Trump signs executive order establishing a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Why stop at stadiums when America’s wild expanses beckon? Turn the Grand Canyon into the “Pump.fun Grand Abyss,” and crypto traders might bid a king’s ransom to see their favorite memecoin rebranded in Google maps. Rechristen Mount Rainier as “Robinhood Rainier” and watch blockchain pioneers scramble to claim its snowy crown. Even the Florida Keys could jangle as the “Chainlink Keys,” the Niagara Falls as “Pwease Falls”, alluring digital asset firms to splash digital gold on a tropical rebrand. These aren’t timid tweaks — they’re loud, proud crypto billboards, turning nature into a Bitcoin honeypot, all the while keeping taxpayers off the hook. The numbers could be extraordinary. Suppose the renaming of Niagara Falls fetches $500 million over a century — a plausible sum given stadium precedents — and 50 other landmarks (lakes, national parks, ranges, rivers, gorges) average $100 million each. That’s $5.5 billion. At Bitcoin’s current price of $90,000 per coin as of March 2025, this yields roughly 61,111 BTC. Push the envelope with blockbuster assets — say, the Gulf of Coinbase instead of the recently rebranded Gulf of America, or the “Gemini Grand Canyon” hitting $1 billion each — and the total could near 100,000 BTC over 100 years. These aren’t one-offs; re-auctioning every century, adjusted for inflation and Bitcoin’s trajectory, ensures a steady stream, aligning with the Executive Order’s long-term vision. Critics might clutch their pearls at “Coinbase Falls,” decrying the loss of solemnity. But Fenway Park’s charm survives its branded roots, and Wrigley Field thrives despite its gum-inspired name. Public taste adapts — Crypto.com Arena’s rise in Los Angeles shows how fast acceptance follows audacity. Better yet, the windfall could fund conservation efforts, helping to minimize the burden of its $3 billion dollar annual budget for the U.S. National Park Service , all in the spirit of the Department of Government Efficiency , in addition to the newly signed Executive Order. The stakes could not be higher. The Fact Sheet laments $17 billion lost to premature Bitcoin sales, a lesson in the cost of inertia. With 21 million coins fixed forever, Bitcoin’s “digital gold” status demands action. The Executive Order centralizes forfeited holdings, but seizures alone won’t scale a world-leading reserve. Nor will adding to the Fed’s Bitcoin coffers while taking on additional government debt, which already stands at $36 trillion dollars (and counting). Hence, naming rights offer a proactive, budget-neutral boost, echoing President Trump’s call to harness digital assets for prosperity without burdening the American public with additional debt. Selling Maine, Vermont & Massachusetts to buy Bitcoin is budget neutral. — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) March 7, 2025 Implementation needs grit. Auctions must be open and fierce, inviting bids from Coinbase to obscure meme-coin startups. No need for restraint — let “Polkadot Pikes Peak” or “XRP Yosemite” fly if the price is right. The Treasury could time Bitcoin buys to dodge volatility, as the Fact Sheet allows for savvy stewardship. This isn’t about defacing nature — it’s about seizing a moment. Lake Michigan will still shimmer; the Mississippi River will still roar. The real prize is a bussin’ Bitcoin reserve, built without fiscal strain, proving America can lead the crypto charge with creativity and swagger. Whatever it takes, please.

It might sound like a niche issue, but a new analysis suggests that where candidates stand on digital assets could significantly influence the ballot box. Let’s dive into how Stand With Crypto , a prominent digital asset advocacy group, is highlighting the growing power of crypto voters in the Garden State and what it could mean for the 2025 race. Why are Crypto Voters a Decisive Force in the New Jersey Election? It’s no secret that cryptocurrency has moved from the fringes of the internet to mainstream conversations. But are crypto enthusiasts a voting bloc to be reckoned with? According to Cointelegraph , Stand With Crypto believes so, especially in New Jersey. Their recent report indicates that around 62,000 individuals in New Jersey have joined their organization. Sixty-two thousand might seem like a drop in the ocean in a statewide election, but in closely contested races, such numbers can be incredibly impactful. Think of it as a highly motivated and potentially swingable voting segment. Here’s why this is noteworthy: Concentrated Interest: These 62,000 individuals are not just casually interested in crypto; they’ve actively joined an advocacy group. This suggests a high level of engagement and a willingness to vote based on crypto-related issues. Swing Voter Potential: The survey data reveals a nuanced picture. While 63% favor pro-crypto candidates, a significant 17% would actively vote against anti-crypto candidates. This indicates a strong negative incentive that could sway voting decisions. Beyond Demographics: Cryptocurrency adoption isn’t limited to a specific age group or political affiliation. It spans across demographics, potentially making this voting bloc influential across different segments of the electorate. Stand With Crypto: Amplifying Voter Influence in the Gubernatorial Race Stand With Crypto isn’t just counting numbers; they’re actively working to ensure that candidates understand the importance of digital assets to their constituents. Their analysis isn’t just about raw figures; it’s about understanding voter sentiment. The February survey of 400 members provides valuable insights into the mindset of these crypto voters . Let’s break down the key findings from their survey: Preference Percentage Favor pro-crypto candidates 63% Will not vote for anti-crypto candidates 17% Undecided or neutral 20% These numbers aren’t just statistics; they are a message to gubernatorial hopefuls. Ignoring the crypto community in New Jersey might come at a political cost. Candidates who proactively engage with this demographic and articulate clear stances on digital asset policy could gain a significant edge. Conversely, those who dismiss or oppose cryptocurrency might alienate a sizable and motivated portion of the electorate. How Could Voter Influence Manifest in the Election? So, how exactly could this voter influence play out in the New Jersey gubernatorial race? It’s not just about candidates making vague statements about “innovation.” Crypto voters are likely to be looking for concrete positions on specific issues. Here are a few potential areas where candidate stances on cryptocurrency could matter: Regulatory Clarity: Voters may want to know where candidates stand on state-level regulations for cryptocurrency businesses and activities. Do they favor a welcoming regulatory environment or stricter controls? Taxation of Digital Assets: Tax policies related to cryptocurrency are a significant concern for holders. Candidates’ views on taxing crypto gains and transactions will be closely scrutinized. Cryptocurrency Adoption by the State: Some voters might be interested in seeing the state government itself adopt or explore cryptocurrency for various applications, such as payments or record-keeping. Consumer Protection: Ensuring consumer protection in the crypto space is crucial. Candidates might be asked about their plans to safeguard investors and users from fraud and scams. Blockchain Technology Initiatives: Beyond cryptocurrency, blockchain technology has broader applications. Candidates could be asked about their vision for leveraging blockchain for state services or economic development. Navigating the Gubernatorial Race: Actionable Insights for Candidates and Crypto Voters For candidates vying for the governorship, the message is clear: understanding and addressing the concerns of crypto voters is no longer optional – it’s strategic. Here are some actionable insights: For Candidates: Educate Yourself: Familiarize yourself with the basics of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Understand the key issues and concerns within the crypto community. Engage with the Community: Reach out to crypto advocacy groups and individuals in New Jersey. Listen to their perspectives and concerns. Articulate a Clear Stance: Don’t be vague. Develop clear and well-reasoned positions on crypto-related issues. Explain your approach to regulation, innovation, and consumer protection. Highlight Potential Benefits: Frame your crypto policy in terms of economic opportunity, innovation, and job creation. Show how a pro-crypto stance can benefit New Jersey. For Crypto Voters: Stay Informed: Research candidates’ positions on cryptocurrency. Don’t rely on assumptions or generalizations. Make Your Voice Heard: Contact candidates and their campaigns. Ask them direct questions about their crypto policies. Organize and Mobilize: Work with groups like Stand With Crypto to amplify your collective voice. Encourage fellow crypto enthusiasts to register and vote. Vote Strategically: Consider candidates’ overall platforms, but weigh their crypto stance as a significant factor in your decision. The Crucial Role of Crypto Voters in Shaping New Jersey’s Future The 2025 New Jersey gubernatorial election is shaping up to be more than just a traditional political contest. The emergence of crypto voters as a potentially decisive force adds a new dimension to the race. Candidates who recognize this shift and engage thoughtfully with the crypto community may find themselves with a significant advantage. For crypto enthusiasts in New Jersey, this election presents an opportunity to make their voices heard and influence the future direction of the state’s digital asset policies. The message is clear: crypto is no longer a fringe topic; it’s a political issue with real-world electoral consequences.

Binance Puts Tracking Tag on GoPlus Security (GPS) Amid Market Manipulation Concerns According to Binance, this decision was made due to significant price declines immediately after GPS was listed on the exchange and concerns regarding the market-making behavior of one of GPS’s designated market makers. The exchange cited the following irregularities: 70 million GPS tokens were sold by the market maker between 16:00 on March 4 and 12:55 on March 5 No purchase order was placed by the market maker during this period. The market maker continuously sold GPS tokens immediately after spot trading opened Market maker became the biggest profiteer, earning around 5 million USDT In response, Binance has temporarily suspended the market maker’s account and is conducting an in-depth investigation into the matter. What Does the Tracking Label Mean? Tokens with a Watch Label are considered highly volatile and risky, and Binance requires users to pass a test every 90 days before trading. The quiz is designed to ensure that investors understand the risks associated with these tokens. Tokens marked with a Watch Label may also be at risk of being delisted if they fail to meet Binance’s listing criteria. Binance stated that it will conduct regular reviews of GPS and other tagged tokens based on the following factors: Commitment of the project team Development activity Trading volume and liquidity Network security and stability Public communication Binance's response to due diligence requests Evidence of unethical or fraudulent behavior Overall contribution to the crypto ecosystem Binance assured users that it will continue to monitor GPS closely and take necessary action based on the latest findings. *This is not investment advice.

Notably, the attorney called out reasons why the U.S. Bitcoin reserve could potentially lose value against the ‘crypto stockpile’ moving ahead. This conjecture primarily rides on the back of a scenario wherein altcoins outperform BTC. Pro-XRP Lawyer Rationalizes Why Bitcoin Reserve Could Depreciate Against Crypto Stockpile XRP lawyer Bill Morgan revealed in an X post on March 7 that the setback lies in a case that assets within the crypto stockpile outperform BTC. “The market won’t care about what asset is in the strategic reserve,” the attorney added, even if it is the flagship crypto. Historically, the market has sought value and will continue doing so, buying better assets and thus presenting risk to Bitcoin. Morgan further sparked market speculations by saying, ‘There will be an inherent risk of the Bitcoin strategic reserve losing value against the non-BTC market and US crypto stockpile,” given altcoins outperform. America’s BTC Reserve-Only Approach: A Boon Or Curse? The attorney highlighted that if the U.S. crypto stockpile is not increased by budget-neutral acquisition despite its assets outperforming BTC, other countries with a broader approach toward crypto reserves could leverage substantially. Given that this saga happens, the U.S. may constantly need to take action to protect its BTC-only reserve. In turn, the flagship coin could see further advantages in the American market. “A form of market protectionism,” the pro-XRP lawyer added, sparking market speculations. “Where would that leave a free crypto market with a level playing field?” Morgan concluded by questioning David Sacks, America’s Crypto Czar. US Strategic Reserve & Crypto Stockpile: Here’s All To Know Notably, U.S. President Donald Trump recently signed a Bitcoin Executive order to establish a BTC strategic reserve. America’s latest BTC reserve will contain roughly 200,000 coins that are already in the government’s possession. These coins have been seized over the years as a result of crackdown on criminal and illicit activities. Besides, David Sacks recently revealed that Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick have been appointed to tap into more resources to acquire additional BTC for reserve purposes. This avenue is taken to achieve a feat that avoids taxpayer money. On the other hand, the crypto stockpile will encompass assets like XRP, ADA, ETH, and SOL. However, the key difference between the reserve and stockpile remains in upsizing them. While more ways to acquire BTC for the U.S. reserve are in the pipeline, the govt. will not actively look for ways to purchase more assets in the stockpile.

Top Analyst Says a Big Move Is Coming!,https://coinpedia.org/news/litecoin-price-to-crash-or-recover-top-analyst-says-a-big-move-is-coming/,"The post Litecoin Price To Crash or Recover? Top Analyst Says a Big Move Is Coming! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Litecoin (LTC) was one of the few altcoins that exhibited price dominance against BTC and outperformance against major crypto assets, LTC price dropped as low as $95, reflecting a 15% drop in a week. Despite the drop, crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggests that (the MVRV) ratio hints toward a bullish recovery. MVRV Ratio Hints Bullish Signals According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the MVRV indicator signals that LTC remains in a healthy position despite recent market fluctuations. The MVRV ratio is a key metric that helps traders assess whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued. A low MVRV suggests the asset is in an accumulation phase, while a high MVRV signals potential profit-taking from investors. #Litecoin $LTC maintains a bullish outlook as the MVRV Ratio signals strength! pic.twitter.com/Xprn0NqyXF — Ali (@ali_charts) March 7, 2025 Looking at Ali Martinez’s latest chart, Litecoin’s MVRV ratio is maintaining strength even after pullbacks to psychological support at $100. This suggests that long-term holders are staying confident, and selling pressure is relatively low. However, if this trend continues, Litecoin could be setting up for a significant move toward $108 and further to $117. Litecoin Under Pressure as Key Events Approach Litecoin’s recent drop has worried traders, especially after it was left out of the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve. This decision has made many investors more bearish, leading to an increase in short positions. Even though some traders still hope for a Litecoin ETF approval , other major events could impact the market first. The upcoming White House summit and the U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report are expected to shape investor sentiment in the coming days. With Litecoin now trading below the important $100 level, there is a growing risk of further declines if buyers don’t step in soon. Bears Target a Drop to $85 Litecoin’s price has turned bearish after gaining momentum in February. The recent drop has pushed LTC near the lower Bollinger Band at $102.77 , indicating oversold conditions and increased volatility. If buyers fail to regain support at $100, sellers could drive the price down further to the next major support at $85, a level that has historically seen strong demand. Even, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 37.62, suggesting that Litecoin is nearing oversold territory.",News,EN,0,0,LTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-07 09:14:50

This trader has demonstrated solid faith in MUTM’s market potential by reinvesting their original $14,000 acquisition of the project just a few days later. Mutuum Finance’s presale currently operates in the second part at $0.015 and it has obtained $2.3 million from investors along with 4,300 token holders during its current phase. Current investors who purchase before MUTM lists on exchanges will achieve a 300% profit boost as the token price moves from $0.015 to $0.06. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Momentum The presale pace for Mutuum Finance continues to increase despite the forthcoming rise in price to $0.02. Customers quickly exhausted the first phase of the presale and now demand is overwhelming during the second phase release. MUTM tokens currently sell at $0.015 while the offering period shortens quickly. Those who purchase MUTM tokens during the upcoming phase will obtain a 33% gain because the price will rise from $0.015 to $0.02. Prior to reaching exchanges Mutuum Finance offers investors the possibility to earn a token value increase of 300% to the listing price of $0.06. The project obtains its success from powerful tokenomics innovations along with practical utility in the real world. Mutuum Finance delivers a decentralized loan platform that provides users opportunities to take loans and lend money together with passive income generation. Users earning revenue through the mtTokens system because these tokens accumulate interest as time passes. The useful implementation of blockchain technology in the Mutuum Finance project has attracted more than 4,300 users as demand surges. The Power of Mutuum Finance’s Lending Model Mutuum Finance stands out through its systematic lending method for creating sustained market growth and operational stability. Mutuum Finance operates through two distinct functions and allows its users to access tokenized assets by either depositing assets to liquidity pools for earning interest or borrowing assets by providing assets with extra value. The systematic model creates risk reduction and liquid asset availability which makes it a desirable option between both lenders and borrowers. Mutuum Finance includes a feature that enables users to deal with each other for loan terms through its peer-to-peer (P2P) lending system. The lending system proves especially beneficial because it allows people to get access to special assets like meme coins that conventional pools reject. Users find the platform more compelling because its purchase distribution capabilities use platform revenue to repurchase MUTM tokens and disperse them among stakers. A continuous buying environment pushes up the value of the token since it implements regular purchase activities. A Token Built for Long-Term Growth The token structure at Mutuum Finance has been strategically designed to produce enduring sustainable growth. The token allocation strategy gives first priority to liquidity mining alongside platform development and partnership investments which sustains an expansive and effective ecosystem. This distribution method urges investors to keep their tokens while simultaneously decreasing market pressure from sellers thus enforcing market equilibrium. Experts expect the MUTM value to rise up to $1.50 after its launch which creates substantial long-term return potential for early purchase investors. A $2,500 investment at $0.015 presale price could result in a total value of $150,000 by reaching $1.50 per token. The crypto market shows mixed returns but MUTM offers such exceptional returns that investors find this token highly appealing to reach financial growth objectives. An investor who won big with Bonk (BONK) shows his faith in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) through significant capital investment. MUTM shows impressive potential for development because of its inventive loan structure combined with solid token system development and thriving presale data. The second phase of the presale, priced at $0.015, offers a limited-time opportunity to secure tokens at a discount before the next price hike. As the project moves closer to its exchange listing, demand is expected to surge, making now the ideal time to invest. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this groundbreaking project—act fast before the price increases.

Analysts suggest that institutional investors will take Bitcoin more seriously, while market watchers expect big price movements as liquidity dynamics and government involvement evolve. Analysts Predict Crypto Market Recovery The total cryptocurrency market capitalization soared to a record high of $3.73 trillion on Dec. 14 of 2024, before experiencing a big 20+% decline to $2.89 trillion. Despite this pullback, some analysts are still optimistic about the market’s future trajectory, and predict a potential recovery and new all-time highs in the second quarter of 2025. Mark Quant , a crypto markets researcher, presented an analysis which suggests that the Global Liquidity Index (GLI) could be a key factor in the market’s resurgence. The GLI measures the ease of financing in global financial markets, and provides insight into global financial conditions. Historically, a rise in the GLI has been associated with increased investor access to capital, which in turn fuels demand for risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Quant pointed to a strong 0.77 correlation between the GLI and total crypto market capitalization, with a 74-day offset, which indicates that liquidity expansions tend to precede bullish trends in the crypto market. Based on this historical relationship, he suggested that the market could move sideways for the next month before beginning an upward trajectory in early April. This could potentially push the total market capitalization beyond $4 trillion. The relationship between liquidity and crypto prices aligns with previous research , like the work of macroeconomist Lyn Alden, who found that Bitcoin historically followed global liquidity trends approximately 83% of the time over a 12-month period. Compared to other asset classes like the S&P 500, gold, and global equity indices, Bitcoin demonstrated the highest correlation with global liquidity conditions. However, Alden pointed out that short-term deviations could occur because of unique market events or internal dynamics. During the recent market decline, analysts closely monitored key support levels to determine whether a bottom is in. Dom, a market analyst, pointed out that the total market cap is currently testing significant support at its 2021 cycle high and its March 2024 peak. He also shared that the yearly relative volume-weighted average price (rVWAP) sits just below the current market level, which reinforces the idea that the market structure remains intact for now. He warned that breaking below the current monthly lows could jeopardize the bull market’s continuation. Daan Crypto , another well-known trader, believes that the outcome of the current weekly close will be a critical factor in assessing the market’s direction. As the total market cap is still under its 2021 highs, there are signs that bearish sentiment is trying to gain control over the higher time frame charts. Whether the market finds support at these levels or sees further downside remains to be seen. US Crypto Reserve Could Boost Bitcoin Market Cap An analysis by Sygnum Bank suggests that the creation of a strategic crypto reserve in the United States could drive Bitcoin’s market capitalization up by approximately 25%, adding around $460 billion in value. Donald Trump envisions a national crypto stockpile that includes Bitcoin along with other digital assets like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Sygnum's research pointed out the potential for a major price multiplier effect, and estimates that every $1 billion of net inflows into Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) leads to a 3-6% increase in BTC’s price. Inflows vs Bitcoin price (Source: Sygnum Bank ) Katalin Tischhauser, Sygnum’s head of research, explained that Bitcoin’s liquid supply is relatively small, making it highly susceptible to upward price shocks from large inflows. She added that if federal or state governments begin purchasing Bitcoin, it will likely set off a chain reaction, encouraging institutional investors and even other governments to follow suit. The discussion around a national crypto reserve gained a lot of traction in July of 2024 when US Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced the BITCOIN Act, which is a proposal that is aimed at establishing a dedicated US Bitcoin reserve. Since then, more than half of US states entertained similar initiatives at a state level, though not all have been successful. On March 2, Trump said that he is committed to the initiative, which fueled an initial market rally that later faded as broader macroeconomic concerns and trade tensions took hold. Despite the excitement, progress on these plans has been uneven, with five states already rejecting crypto reserve proposals. Tischhauser’s prediction could very soon become a reality as President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile. The reserve will initially be funded with cryptocurrency that was seized in government criminal cases. White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks confirmed that the Bitcoin reserve will be capitalized with assets forfeited through criminal or civil proceedings. A White House fact sheet also outlined that the Digital Asset Stockpile will include cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. US Bitcoin Reserve a Turning Point for Crypto The establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the United States greatly reduces the likelihood of a government ban on Bitcoin and could accelerate adoption by other nations, according to crypto analysts. The announcement initially triggered a 6% drop in Bitcoin’s price , but many believe the market reaction may have been misplaced as the move is a long-term bullish signal. Bitcoin’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan believes that a US strategic Bitcoin reserve makes it highly unlikely that the federal government will ever ban Bitcoin. This aligns with a November 2024 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, which suggested that Bitcoin could pressure the government to balance its budget. The move is also expected to push other nations to consider establishing their own Bitcoin reserves. The US currently leads in nation-state Bitcoin holdings with approximately 207,189 BTC worth $18 billion. The US is followed by China with 194,000 BTC and the United Kingdom with 61,000 BTC. El Salvador is the only country to have made Bitcoin legal tender and continues to accumulate. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong expects G20 nations to take note and eventually follow the US lead. Hougan also pointed out how the reserve’s creation legitimizes Bitcoin in the eyes of institutional investors, which makes it harder for organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to argue against sovereign Bitcoin holdings. The IMF previously pressured nations like El Salvador to limit their Bitcoin investments. Bitwise head of research Ryan Rasmussen revealed some of the broader implications of the US Bitcoin reserve, and believes that it removes institutional excuses for not investing in Bitcoin, as well as increases the likelihood of further state-level Bitcoin purchases. Lightspark CEO David Marcus described the move as a balanced and rational decision, while crypto lawyer John Deaton pointed out that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have been directed to explore “budget-neutral” ways to acquire more Bitcoin.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|FIAT|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-07 09:19:07

Kweon Seong-dong, floor leader of the People Power Party (PPP), addressed during a meeting with government officials and heads of local cryptocurrency exchanges at the National Assembly in Seoul, March 7. Korean Government to ‘Review’ Global Trends on Crypto ETFs Per local reports , he stressed the need for “system improvements” to develop the crypto assets market. He added that the authorities will “review” these products and their trends worldwide, before implementing them. “The government and the PPP will review global trends before considering the approval of the spot crypto ETFs, taking infrastructure and regulatory framework into account,” he told reporters Friday. Further, Seong-dong emphasized that policies that consider “both user protection and market development,” are inevitable, given soaring crypto trading volume. According to Bloomberg , from last Nov. 5-28, the daily average trading on Korean crypto exchanges amounted to about $9.4 billion. At the time, crypto trading was much bigger than the Korea Composite Stock Price Index or KOSPI at $7 billion.

The regulator, however, expressed a cautionary approach to cryptos and in particular, BTC ETFs. Recently, Korea Financial Investment Association Chairman Seo Yoo-seok highlighted that the nation has to embrace cryptocurrency ETFs to not lag behind global markets. “While the virtual asset market is projected to continue its expansion, Korea should not be left out,” he noted. Further, some South Korean financial chiefs claimed that the FSC is allowing rival nations to lead in crypto ETFs. Jung Eun-bo, chairman of the Korea Exchange (KRX), said last month that the country risks falling behind if it delays crypto ETF adoption. “Cryptocurrency represents a sector capable of generating new value in the financial industry,” Jung stated. “We must not delay the introduction of cryptocurrency ETF trading.” The post South Korean Ruling Party Head Considers Approving Spot Crypto ETFs appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Crypto ETFs|ETFs|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-03-07 09:19:55

For Ethereum developers and stakers, staying informed about network changes is crucial. The latest update from the Ethereum Foundation brings news of a significant shift in their testnet infrastructure. Get ready for an important transition: the Ethereum Foundation has officially announced the deprecation of the Mekong testnet, effective March 7. But what does this mean for you, and why is it happening? Let’s dive into the details of this critical update and understand its implications for the Ethereum ecosystem. Why is Ethereum Deprecating the Mekong Testnet? The Ethereum Foundation’s decision to deprecate the Mekong testnet is a strategic move aligned with the ongoing development and enhancement of the Ethereum network. Mekong was specifically created as a testing ground for wallet developers to experiment with user experience (UX) improvements and for stakers to get hands-on experience with the upcoming Pectra upgrade. However, as development progresses, testnets also need to evolve to accurately reflect the current state of the Ethereum mainnet and future upgrades. Here’s a breakdown of the key reasons behind the Mekong testnet deprecation: Pectra Upgrade Activation on Sepolia and Holesky: The primary reason for Mekong’s sunset is the successful activation of the Pectra upgrade on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets. These testnets are now fully equipped to handle the testing needs related to Pectra, rendering Mekong’s specific purpose redundant. Streamlining Testnet Infrastructure: Maintaining multiple testnets requires resources and can sometimes lead to fragmentation of the testing community. By deprecating Mekong, the Ethereum Foundation is streamlining its testnet infrastructure, focusing developer and staker activity on Sepolia and Holesky. Focus on Long-Term, Robust Testnets: Sepolia and Holesky are designed as long-term, robust testnets intended to mirror the mainnet environment closely. Concentrating development and testing efforts on these networks ensures a more consistent and reliable testing experience for the Ethereum community. Essentially, the deprecation of Mekong is not a setback but a sign of progress. It indicates that the Ethereum development roadmap is advancing, and the testing infrastructure is being optimized to support future innovations. Understanding the Pectra Upgrade and its Role in the Ethereum Ecosystem The Pectra upgrade is a significant step forward for Ethereum, encompassing both the consensus layer (execution layer) and the execution layer (EVM) changes. It’s designed to enhance the network’s capabilities, efficiency, and user experience. Mekong testnet was instrumental in the early stages of testing UX changes related to this upgrade. Now, with Pectra live on Sepolia and Holesky, developers have more advanced and stable environments to continue their work. Key aspects of the Pectra upgrade include: Execution Layer Improvements (EVM): Pectra brings enhancements to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), potentially leading to increased smart contract efficiency and new functionalities for developers. Consensus Layer Upgrades: Changes in the consensus layer aim to improve network security, stability, and the overall staking experience. This is crucial for the long-term health and decentralization of Ethereum. UX Enhancements: As Mekong was initially focused on UX changes, Pectra likely includes features designed to make Ethereum more user-friendly, especially for wallet users and those interacting with decentralized applications (dApps). For a detailed breakdown of all the technical specifications and features included in the Pectra upgrade, developers are encouraged to refer to the official Ethereum Foundation blog and developer resources. Understanding Pectra is vital for anyone building on or interacting with the Ethereum network. What are Sepolia and Holesky Testnets and Why are They Important? With Mekong being retired, Sepolia and Holesky are now the primary focus for Ethereum testing. These are not just replacements; they are designed to be superior testnets offering a more realistic and comprehensive testing environment. Let’s explore what makes them crucial for Ethereum development: Sepolia Testnet: Permissioned and Stable: Sepolia is a permissioned proof-of-stake testnet, meaning it has a controlled set of validators. This permissioned nature contributes to its stability and predictability, making it ideal for application developers who need a reliable environment to test smart contracts and dApps. Realistic State: Sepolia aims to maintain a state that is reasonably close to the Ethereum mainnet, allowing developers to test under conditions that mirror the real-world network. Focus on Application Development: Sepolia is particularly well-suited for testing application-level functionalities, smart contract interactions, and integrations with other Ethereum ecosystem tools. Holesky Testnet: Public and Scalable: Holesky is designed as a public, open-participation testnet. It is intended to simulate the more open and permissionless nature of the Ethereum mainnet. Large Scale Testing: Holesky is built to handle larger scale testing scenarios, including network stress tests and simulations of high transaction volume. This makes it valuable for testing infrastructure and network-level upgrades. Staking and Protocol Development: Holesky is particularly relevant for stakers and protocol developers who need to test changes in a more decentralized and potentially volatile environment, similar to mainnet conditions. By utilizing both Sepolia and Holesky, Ethereum developers and stakers gain access to a diverse and robust suite of testing environments, catering to different needs and development stages. Actionable Insights for Developers and Stakers The Mekong testnet deprecation requires immediate action from developers and stakers who were utilizing it. Here’s a step-by-step guide to ensure a smooth transition: Migrate from Mekong: If you are currently using Mekong for testing or development, immediately begin migrating your activities to either Sepolia or Holesky, depending on your testing requirements. Update Configurations: Update your development tools, scripts, and configurations to point to the Sepolia or Holesky testnet endpoints. Ensure your wallet and node setups are correctly configured for the new testnets. Familiarize with Sepolia and Holesky: If you are new to Sepolia or Holesky, take time to explore their characteristics and choose the one that best suits your testing needs. Review the official Ethereum documentation for setup guides and network details. Stay Updated: Regularly check the Ethereum Foundation blog and developer channels for the latest updates on testnet infrastructure, Pectra upgrade progress, and any further announcements. Community Engagement: Engage with the Ethereum developer community through forums, chats, and social media to share experiences, ask questions, and stay informed about best practices for testing on Sepolia and Holesky. The deprecation date of March 7 is an important deadline. Ensure all necessary migrations and updates are completed before this date to avoid any disruption to your development or testing workflows. Embracing Change and Moving Forward with Ethereum Development The Ethereum ecosystem is characterized by continuous evolution and improvement. The deprecation of the Mekong testnet, while requiring adjustments, is a positive indicator of this ongoing progress. By focusing resources on Sepolia and Holesky, the Ethereum Foundation is providing developers and stakers with more robust, relevant, and future-proof testing environments. This strategic shift strengthens the foundation for future upgrades and innovations on Ethereum. For developers, this means access to better tools and more realistic testing conditions, ultimately leading to more reliable and efficient dApps and smart contracts. For stakers, it ensures a testing ground that closely mirrors the mainnet, allowing for thorough preparation for protocol upgrades. Embrace this change as a step forward in the journey of Ethereum, and leverage the enhanced capabilities of Sepolia and Holesky to drive your contributions to this groundbreaking blockchain.

The expiry, set for 8:00 UTC on Deribit, could lead to increased volatility in the crypto market. The “put-to-call ratio” of 0.67 shows that there are more put options (bets that Bitcoin’s price will fall) than call options (bets that Bitcoin’s price will rise). And the maximum pain point, that is the price that will cause the most losses for holders is $89,000. Besides, Ethereum will also have a large number of contracts expire, totaling $481.9 million. The “maximum pain point” for Ethereum is $2,300, and the put-to-call ratio of 0.72. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have put-to-call ratios below 1, meaning there are more traders betting on price increases (buying calls) than on price drops (buying puts). Bearish Sentiment In The Market The overall sentiment in the crypto market is negative (bearish). Bitcoin’s recent price swings, such as drops of $6,000, have created a volatile market that traders are finding difficult to navigate, often experiencing losses in both directions. Analysts from Greeks.live note that traders are focusing on key price levels, with resistance around $87,000-$89,000 and a recent bottom around $82,000, though there is disagreement on whether the bottom is sustainable. The market’s pessimism is evident in the higher number of traders buying options for downside protection (puts). The market is currently volatile, with traders focusing on quick entries and exits due to the risk of sudden price changes. Factors like trade policies and tariffs add uncertainty, making many traders cautious. Bitcoin Declines After Trump’s Reserve Announcment After Bitcoin options expire, prices may settle, but generally markets return to normal soon. This comes after President Trump’s recent executive order on the Bitcoin reserve, although many details are still unclear and are expected to be discussed at the White House Crypto Summit. Contrary to the expectations, Bitcoin dropped 5% to $84,667 following President Trump’s Bitcoin reserve announcement, triggering $261 million in liquidations in the futures market. Major Summit Ahead Bitcoin’s price dropped ahead of a major crypto summit, with long positions suffering the most. Liquidations reached $115.6 million, and BTC’s open interest fell by 5%. If the downtrend continues, BTC could test support at $85,357 and possibly drop to $80,580. However, if new demand pushes the price up, BTC could rise back above $90,000, potentially reaching $92,247.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ETH|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-07 09:22:08

The post included a screenshot of Kraken listing the five cryptocurrencies announced so far: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. The post quickly gained traction within the XRP community. Adoption is a key driver of growth for the digital asset, and putting it in the crypto reserve will boost its credibility. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!! Major exchange “Kraken” has released a list of “US Strategic Reserve” assets! #XRP pic.twitter.com/2wV3kBM40I — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) March 5, 2025 Official Announcement and Market Response On March 2, President Donald Trump formally announced the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve , confirming that the government would hold select cryptocurrencies as part of a national strategy. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has consistently called for an inclusive reserve with multiple assets, and Trump’s inclusion of XRP is a major victory for the community and Ripple. Following the announcement, XRP surged to $2.97. Some analysts predict it could reach double-digit prices due to growing institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. While there have been some market corrections, investor sentiment remains overwhelmingly bullish. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Growing Institutional Legitimacy and Media Recognition In addition to the Kraken listing, mainstream media outlets have begun covering XRP’s inclusion in the reserve. A recent Fox News segment drew attention to the government’s adoption of crypto assets, reinforcing the significance of this decision. Coverage from the mainstream media has further cemented XRP’s growing legitimacy in institutional finance. Many believe this recognition will encourage more adoption from banks, financial institutions, and policymakers. The Future of XRP and U.S. Crypto Strategy With the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve officially established, XRP is positioned as a key player in the country’s evolving digital asset strategy. Analysts speculate this could accelerate regulatory clarity, benefiting XRP’s long-term adoption. The current administration’s stance on cryptocurrency is evident in the recent string of crypto-related lawsuit dismissals, and the announcement of the first-ever White House Crypto Summit. While the Ripple lawsuit is yet to be dismissed, experts suggest it could happen as soon as today . The regulatory landscape in the U.S. is shifting rapidly, and Trump is on track to fulfill his promise of making the U.S. the crypto capital of the world.

In a recent statement, Yakovenko likened the Bitcoin reserve to a “scalpel,” suggesting that the move marks a significant step towards regulatory clarity. Notably, the Solana founder’s statement underscores the administration’s targeted and precise regulatory framework for digital assets. Let’s unveil how Anatoly Yakovenko views Trump’s Bitcoin reserve strategy. Donald Trump’s Bitcoin EO is a Scalpel, Says Solana Co-Founder Donald Trump’s recent executive order for a strategic crypto reserve has invoked widespread enthusiasm. Despite some disagreements with the inclusion of altcoins like XRP, SOL, and ADA, the crypto community stands strong with the Bitcoin order. In a recent X post , Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko addressed the Bitcoin reserve plan as a scalpel. This suggests that the EO’s regulatory approach is characterized by precision and specificity, rather than overly restrictive measures. Significantly, the Solana co-founder’s message highlight the nuances of crypto regulatory landscape and the need for clarity. Yakovenko emphasized that the Bitcoin order will pave the way for more regulatory clarity in the US. He added, “We need a stablecoin bill, guidance to let banks deposit and withdraw crypto, clear rules from the sec and cftc for issuance and defi.” Solana Co-Founder Opposes Crypto Reserve Proposal Despite his recent endorsement, the Solana co-founder criticized Donald Trump’s crypto reserve proposal. His criticisms were based on the idea that the government control could undermine the notion of decentralization. Recently, Yakovenko outlined his preferences regarding a US reserve of cryptocurrencies, with his top choice being no reserve at all. His second preference was to allow individual states to oversee their own reserves. This approach, he believes, would provide a safeguard against potential missteps by the Federal Reserve. In addition to Yakovenko’s opposition, controversy arose when Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson revealed that he had not been invited to the Crypto Summit, where discussions on the reserve were slated to take place. How Will Donald Trump’s Crypto Reserve Reshape Financial Space? According to Robert Kiyosaki, the author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” Bitcoin could heal America’s financial woes. With Trump’s decision to adopt a Bitcoin reserve, the cryptocurrency is poised to reach new all-time highs, stated Kiyosaki. However, Trump’s crypto policies could be a threat to Wall Street . Primarily due to the possible growth of stablecoins, which in turn boosts Silicon Valley’s establishment, the traditional financial ecosystem could collapse. Thus Trump’s pro-crypto stance signals the potential downfall of Wall Street.

Bitcoin Exchange Netflow Has Been Negative Recently According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, Bitcoin has been leaving exchanges recently. The on-chain metric of relevance here is the “Exchange Netflow,” which measures the net amount of BTC entering into or exiting out of the wallets associated with all centralized exchanges. When the value of the indicator is positive, it means the investors are making net deposits of the cryptocurrency into these platforms. As one of the main reasons why holders transfer their tokens to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have a bearish impact on the BTC price. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Price Range Could Be The Bulls’ Final Defense Line, Report Says On the other hand, the metric being under the zero mark suggests the outflows are overwhelming the inflows. Generally, investors take their coins off into self-custody when they plan to hold into the long term, so such a trend can prove to be bullish for the asset. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Exchange Netflow over the past week or so: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Exchange Netflow saw a spike into the positive region on the 27th of last month, but the metric has since remained in the negative region. This trend has maintained despite the fact that the asset has been observing volatility in both directions recently. Thus, it would appear that the investors are still bullish on the cryptocurrency. “Despite the recent market fear, traders have shown conviction in BTC, withdrawing nearly $900 million worth of Bitcoin from exchanges in the past 7 days,” notes the analytics firm. While exchange inflows can be bearish when it comes to volatile assets like BTC, the same doesn’t hold true in the case of stablecoins, digital assets that have their value tied to fiat. Usually, investors who hold these coins eventually plan to invest into the volatile side of the market. Once they feel the time has come, they deposit into the exchanges to swap to the tokens of their choice, thus providing a buying pressure to their prices. Related Reading: Litecoin Whale Deposits 500,000 LTC To Binance: Price Decline To Extend? As such, an increase in stablecoin inflows can be a positive sign for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This trend has recently been developing in the sector, as an analyst has pointed out in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post. As displayed in the above chart, the Binance Stablecoin Exchange Reserve, a metric that keeps track of the total amount of these fiat-tied tokens sitting in the wallets of the Binance platform, has jumped to a new all-time high (ATH) recently.

Let’s dive into what this could mean for your crypto holdings and the future of value within the Jito network. Decoding the New JTO Tokenomics Vision Andrew Thurman, a key contributor to the Jito Foundation – the driving force behind the popular Solana-based liquid staking protocol – has recently shared a compelling paper outlining a novel approach to JTO tokenomics. It’s crucial to understand that this isn’t an official governance proposal just yet, but rather a thought-provoking exploration of how the Jito DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) could strategically manage its revenues. The core objective? To channel value back to the very users who contribute to the Jito ecosystem. Think of it like this: the Jito protocol generates revenue, and the question is, how can this revenue be best utilized to strengthen the ecosystem and reward its participants? Thurman’s paper offers potential pathways, with a significant emphasis on strategies that could directly enhance the value proposition for JTO token holders. Token Buybacks: A Game Changer for Crypto Value? One of the most intriguing ideas put forth is the potential implementation of token buybacks. But what exactly are token buybacks, and why are they generating excitement in the context of JTO and crypto value? Understanding Token Buybacks: In traditional finance, companies sometimes buy back their own stock from the open market. This reduces the number of shares in circulation, potentially increasing the value of the remaining shares. In the crypto world, token buybacks operate on a similar principle. How it Could Work for JTO: The Jito DAO could use a portion of the protocol’s revenues to purchase JTO tokens from exchanges. This would decrease the supply of JTO tokens available, potentially driving up demand and, consequently, the price. Returning Value to Users: By potentially increasing the token price, buybacks can be a direct mechanism to return value to JTO token holders. This is especially relevant for users who have staked their Solana through Jito and received JTO tokens as rewards or participated in the Jito ecosystem in other ways. Imagine a scenario where the Jito protocol is thriving, generating substantial revenue. If the DAO decides to implement token buybacks, a portion of this success could directly translate into increased value for your JTO tokens. This creates a positive feedback loop, where the protocol’s success directly benefits its community. Exploring Other Avenues to Enhance Crypto Value While token buybacks are a prominent highlight, Thurman’s paper likely delves into a broader spectrum of strategies for the Jito DAO to consider. These could include: Staking Rewards Boosts: Directly increasing the rewards for staking Solana through Jito. This could attract more users to the platform and further solidify its position in the Solana staking landscape. Ecosystem Development Grants: Allocating funds to support projects and initiatives that build on top of the Jito protocol or contribute to the broader Solana DeFi ecosystem. This can foster innovation and long-term growth. Community Initiatives: Investing in community-focused programs, education, or events to strengthen engagement and participation within the Jito ecosystem. The key takeaway is that the Jito Foundation is actively exploring ways to ensure that the protocol’s success translates into tangible benefits for its users and the wider Solana community. This user-centric approach is crucial for the sustainable growth and vibrancy of any DeFi protocol. What Does This Mean for Solana Staking Enthusiasts? If you are actively involved in Solana staking or are considering exploring opportunities within the Solana DeFi space, the potential shifts in JTO tokenomics are definitely worth monitoring. Here’s a breakdown of why this news is relevant: Aspect Implication for Solana Staking Enthusiasts Potential for Increased JTO Value Token buybacks and other value-enhancing strategies could lead to appreciation in the price of JTO tokens you hold. Stronger Jito Ecosystem Focus on user value can contribute to a more robust and engaged Jito community, benefiting all participants. Innovation in DeFi Rewards Jito’s approach could set a precedent for other DeFi protocols to prioritize returning value to their users, fostering a healthier and more sustainable DeFi ecosystem. DAO Governance Participation As these ideas evolve into formal proposals, JTO token holders may have the opportunity to participate in governance decisions, shaping the future of JTO tokenomics. It’s important to remember that these are still proposed ideas, and the Jito DAO will ultimately decide on the final direction for JTO tokenomics. However, the fact that these discussions are happening and that there’s a clear focus on user value is a positive signal for the Jito community and the broader Solana DeFi landscape. Navigating the Future of JTO and DeFi The evolving tokenomics of JTO highlights a critical trend in the DeFi space: the increasing emphasis on user empowerment and value distribution. Protocols are realizing that long-term success hinges on creating sustainable ecosystems where users are not just participants but also beneficiaries of the protocol’s growth. Jito’s proactive approach to refining its tokenomics model is a testament to this evolving paradigm. As you navigate the dynamic world of DeFi and Solana staking, staying informed about developments like these is crucial. Keep an eye on official announcements from the Jito Foundation and engage with the Jito community to stay ahead of the curve. The future of JTO tokenomics holds exciting possibilities, potentially unlocking even greater value for users and solidifying Jito’s position as a leading protocol in the Solana ecosystem.

The latest buzz is all about a bold move from former U.S. President Donald Trump that has the crypto world talking. According to Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at Bitwise, a well-known crypto index fund manager, Trump’s newly signed Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is a significant development. While the immediate market reaction remains to be seen, Hougan confidently stated on X (formerly Twitter) that this is a highly bullish signal for Bitcoin (BTC) in the long run. Let’s dive into what this order entails and why industry experts are optimistic. Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: A Game Changer? The news broke via a tweet from David Sacks, often referred to as the White House crypto czar. Sacks revealed that President Trump had indeed signed an Executive Order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . This isn’t just about holding some Bitcoin; it’s a formal government initiative to establish a reserve, signaling a major shift in how the U.S. government views and interacts with cryptocurrency. But what exactly does this mean for the crypto market and for Bitcoin specifically? Let’s break down the key aspects: Government Backed Bitcoin Holding: The U.S. government is officially stepping into the role of a significant Bitcoin holder, albeit through seized assets. No Taxpayer Burden: Crucially, the reserve will be funded entirely by Bitcoin already in government possession, specifically BTC seized through federal law enforcement actions. This means no new costs for taxpayers. Substantial Existing Holdings: Estimates suggest the U.S. government already holds around 200,000 BTC. To put this into perspective, at current prices, this is a multi-billion dollar reserve! Formal Review Mandated: The Executive Order mandates a formal review and audit of these existing US Bitcoin Holdings . This suggests a move towards greater transparency and formalization of these assets. Potential for Further Acquisition: The order goes a step further, authorizing the Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce to explore ways to acquire even more BTC in a budget-neutral manner. This indicates a proactive approach to potentially grow the reserve in the future. Why is Bitwise CIO So Bullish on this Bitcoin Order? Matt Hougan’s positive reaction isn’t just casual optimism. As a leading voice in crypto investment, his perspective carries weight. Why does he see Trump’s Bitcoin Order as a long-term positive? Here are a few key reasons to consider: Validation and Legitimacy: A formal Strategic Bitcoin Reserve from a major global power like the United States sends a powerful message. It legitimizes Bitcoin as a significant asset class on a national level. This can boost confidence among institutional investors and the general public alike. Reduced Regulatory Uncertainty: Government engagement, even in this form, can be interpreted as a step towards clearer regulatory frameworks. By creating a reserve, the government implicitly acknowledges Bitcoin’s importance, potentially leading to more constructive regulatory approaches in the long run. Supply Dynamics: Holding a significant amount of Bitcoin in a reserve effectively takes that BTC out of active circulation. With Bitcoin’s limited supply, reduced available supply can, in theory, exert upward pressure on price over time, especially as demand grows. Geopolitical Implications: In an increasingly digital and potentially multi-polar world, nations holding Bitcoin reserves could be seen as strategically positioned in the future financial landscape. This order could be interpreted as the U.S. staking a claim in the digital asset space. Unpacking the US Bitcoin Holdings: 200,000 BTC and Counting? The estimated figure of 200,000 BTC held by the U.S. government is substantial. Where did this Bitcoin come from? Primarily, it’s the result of: Law Enforcement Seizures: A significant portion originates from seizures related to criminal activities, particularly in the early days of Bitcoin when it was often associated with illicit online marketplaces. Forfeiture and Confiscation: Through various legal processes, the government has acquired Bitcoin as proceeds of crime and through asset forfeiture. While 200,000 BTC is a widely cited estimate, it’s important to note that: No Public Audit: As the announcement mentions, a full, public audit of these holdings hasn’t been conducted yet. The Executive Order mandates a review, which could bring more clarity to the exact figures. Decentralized Nature of Bitcoin: Tracking government-held Bitcoin can be complex due to the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin addresses and transactions. The mandated review is a positive step towards transparency and responsible management of these significant US Bitcoin Holdings . Crypto Market Impact: Short-Term Uncertainty, Long-Term Optimism? While Matt Hougan emphasizes the long-term bullish outlook, he also acknowledges short-term market uncertainty. What could we expect in the immediate future in terms of Crypto Market Impact ? Potential Short-Term Reactions: Price Volatility: Major news events in crypto often trigger price volatility. The market could react with initial price swings in either direction as traders digest the information. Speculation and Rumors: Announcements like this can fuel speculation and rumors, potentially leading to short-term price pumps or dumps based on market sentiment. Regulatory Scrutiny: The news might also intensify regulatory discussions and scrutiny around government holdings of cryptocurrency, which could introduce short-term uncertainty. Long-Term Positive Drivers: Increased Institutional Interest: The U.S. government’s move could further pique the interest of institutional investors who were previously hesitant about Bitcoin. Mainstream Adoption: Government validation can contribute to the ongoing mainstream adoption narrative for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. Positive Sentiment Shift: Over time, the establishment of a reserve could contribute to a more positive long-term sentiment towards Bitcoin, fostering greater investment and adoption. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what should crypto enthusiasts and investors take away from this development? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on further developments related to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . The mandated review and any future acquisition plans will be crucial to monitor. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term market fluctuations are always possible, consider the long-term implications of government validation and potential increased institutional interest in Bitcoin. Diversification and Risk Management: As always, remember the importance of diversification and sound risk management in your crypto portfolio. News like this is significant but the crypto market remains dynamic and evolving. Conclusion: A Strategic Move Towards a Bitcoin Future? Trump’s Executive Order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is undoubtedly a landmark moment for the cryptocurrency industry. While the immediate market reaction may be unpredictable, the long-term implications are potentially profound. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan’s bullish stance reflects a broader sentiment that this move signals a significant step towards mainstream acceptance and long-term growth for Bitcoin. As the U.S. government formalizes its role in the Bitcoin ecosystem, it could pave the way for greater clarity, legitimacy, and ultimately, a more robust future for crypto.

Despite signs of recovery in late 2024, the momentum seems to have stalled, according to DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas, who outlined the sharp decline in a March 6 report. In December 2024, total NFT trading volume stood at $1.36 billion . However, January saw a 26% month-over-month drop, and February delivered an even steeper 50% decline, wiping out much of the recent progress in the sector. “While NFTs appeared to be making a comeback, the trend reversed at the beginning of 2025,” Gherghelas noted, attributing the slump to NFTs’ correlation with cryptocurrency prices. Indeed, the overall crypto market capitalization peaked at $3.71 trillion on December 9, with Bitcoin hitting a record $109,000 on January 20, shortly before Donald Trump’s inauguration. However, February brought uncertainty, as concerns over Trump’s trade tariffs triggered a market-wide selloff, erasing much of the crypto sector’s gains. Surprising Uptick in NFT User Activity While trading volumes tumbled, user engagement with NFT platforms actually rose, showing a 6% increase in February with around 3.5 million unique users. DappRadar suggests that this rise was driven by growing interest in AI-powered digital assets, which are reshaping the NFT landscape. “The increasing integration of artificial intelligence into NFT projects signals a shift toward more dynamic, interactive digital assets with enhanced utility,” Gherghelas explained. She emphasized that NFTs offering real-world applications and deeper engagement will likely drive long-term Web3 adoption, even as speculative trading wanes. When breaking down NFT sales by category, profile picture NFTs remained the top performer, with $243 million in trading volume spread across 76,385 sales. Gaming NFTs followed, generating $41 million from 421,853 transactions, while sports NFTs saw the highest number of transactions (659,097) but only $7.7 million in volume. A Market Struggling to Regain Its Peak Despite short-term fluctuations, the NFT market remains far from its golden era. According to a January DappRadar report, 2024 marked the worst year for NFTs since 2020, with just $13.7 billion in trading volume and under 50 million total sales. For context, NFTs had their best-ever year in 2022, when mainstream hype drove $57.2 billion in trading volume and 121.7 million sales. Whether the market can reclaim those highs remains uncertain, but the industry’s focus seems to be shifting from hype-driven speculation to long-term utility and engagement.

Unlike traditional presales segmented into stages, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) takes a different approach. Its presale is structured around unique locations, each symbolizing a new chapter in Pablo’s quest. Arctic Pablo has reached ChillVille, the 13th location in its journey, with the coin priced at $0.000070. The presale has already raised over $1.77 million, reflecting growing investor interest.

Bybit ‘s $1.4 billion cyberattack, now the largest crypto theft in history, is believed to have started with malware from a fake stock investment project that compromised Safe’s Mac laptop and bypassed Amazon Web Services security, according to Mandiant’s investigation. In a March 6 article on X, Safe revealed that the North Korean hacking group known as TraderTraitor compromised a Safe{Wallet} developer’s laptop, “Developer1,” and used stolen AWS session tokens to bypass multi-factor authentication. According to Mandiant’s investigation, the breach occurred on Feb. 4, when a Docker project — posing as a “stock investment simulator” — was downloaded onto Developer1’s Mac. The project communicated with a suspicious domain (getstockprice[.]com), leading to the malware’s installation. You might also like: Bybit sparks debates as it seeks nearly $100k in refund from ParaSwap DAO tied to hacker’s swap fees It’s unclear what forced Developer1 to download the malware through workstation, but the investigation notes that similar social engineering tactics have already been used in previous attacks by the hacking group. Mandiant’s report also found that the attackers bypassed AWS MFA by hijacking active user session tokens, likely through malware on Developer1’s workstation. These hijacked tokens allowed the hackers to access AWS services without needing to pass MFA checks. The attack was conducted from IP addresses linked to a VPN service and security tools designed for offensive hacking, per the report. “Certain gaps in fully recovering certain aspects of the attack remain because the attacker removed their malware and cleared Bash history in an effort to thwart investigative efforts.” Safe As a precautious measure, Safe{Wallet} has reset its infrastructure, restricting external access. It also claims to have enhanced the detection of malicious transactions with Blockaid, a blockchain security firm. According to Safe, its smart contracts were not affected by the breach. Cryptocurrency exchange Bybit revealed in early March that nearly 20% of the stolen funds are now untraceable, just less than two weeks after the exchange lost $1.46 billion in a highly sophisticated attack. In an X post, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou revealed that around 77% of the stolen funds remain traceable, but nearly 20% has “gone dark” through mixing services.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Ethereum strengthens its network and Chainlink expands its dominance, investors are turning to BitLemons, a revenue-generating crypto with deflationary tokenomics. Table of Contents Has BitLemons found the perfect formula for sustainable token growth? Is Chainlink positioning for a new all-time high? When will Ethereum break its resistance ceiling? How are wealth creators positioning in today’s market? Ethereum’s technical breakthroughs and Chainlink’s double-digit gains dominate headlines, but savvy investors are quietly positioning themselves in BitLemons (BLEM) before it hits exchanges. With its GambleFi protocol already generating actual revenue, dual security audits, and a presale that’s 49% complete in stage 2, BLEM offers rare ground-floor access to what analysts predict could be crypto’s next explosive growth story. Has BitLemons found the perfect formula for sustainable token growth? BitLemons is disrupting the $450 billion traditional casino market with its GambleFi protocol that’s already operational with over 8,000 games from premium providers including Evolution and Pragmatic. Unlike speculative tokens, BitLemons generates revenue 24/7 while allocating 30% of all Gross Gaming Revenue directly to token holders, 15% through strategic buyback and burn mechanisms creating deflationary pressure, and 15% as high-yield staking rewards. With dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof and $1 million raised in its private seed round, BitLemons has extraordinary momentum. Stage 1 sold out in just 16 days, and Stage 2 is already 49% complete at $0.02 per token with over $1.62 million raised. With fewer than 17 million tokens remaining before the price increases to $0.03 in 13 days and industry insiders projecting a listing price between $0.17-$0.18, early investors are positioning for potential 8-9x returns from current levels. Is Chainlink positioning for a new all-time high? Chainlink (LINK) has demonstrated remarkable resilience, trading at $17.11 with a 22% surge over the past week. The decentralized oracle network continues to expand its ecosystem, establishing itself as the critical infrastructure connecting smart contracts with real-world data. LINK’s technical indicators reveal a decisive breakout above key resistance levels, accompanied by an abnormally high trading volume of $1.17b. The token has established strong support at the $15.00 level while facing resistance near $17.64. With a market capitalization now exceeding $10.91b and bullish sentiment at 87%, institutional interest continues to flow into the project as it cements its position as an essential blockchain infrastructure. You might also like: Is BitLemons quietly becoming a bigger opportunity than Bitcoin and TRUMP? When will Ethereum break its resistance ceiling? Ethereum has been steadily reclaiming lost ground, trading at $2,196.07 with a 2.6% gain over the past week. Despite recent security concerns, including reports of hackers linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group laundering nearly 500,000 ETH, the market remains optimistic about Ethereum’s fundamentals. ETH’s $264.78b market cap is supported by a significant trading volume of $21.27b, signaling renewed investor confidence in the smart contract platform. The successful Pectra testnet upgrade has bolstered expectations for improved scalability and transaction efficiency in the upcoming main net implementation, addressing long-standing user concerns. Key support has formed at $2,100 with resistance around $2,300, suggesting a potential continuation of the upward trajectory if market conditions remain favorable. How are wealth creators positioning in today’s market? While Ethereum and Chainlink present compelling cases for continued growth, BitLemons stands apart with its revenue-generating platform already in operation. At just $0.02 during Stage 2 and analysts projecting listing prices of $0.17-$0.18, the mathematical advantage becomes clear. With Stage 2 presale already 49% complete and only 13 days remaining until the next price increase, this rare ground-floor opportunity is rapidly disappearing. The only question savvy investors are asking is how substantial a position to establish before this window closes. For more information on BitLemons, visit the website or socials .

As a result, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Floki (FLOKI) have already set the ball rolling, as evidenced by a triple-digit year-to-date surge. Durag Doge ($DURAG) is also not being left out in spite being the new kid on the meme coin block, This is because it's a meme coin with swag with its long-term objective being blending innovation, community, and culture. Durag Doge Keeps the Meme Coin Ball Rolling Having recorded a year-to-date increase of 238.2% , Dogecoin continues to steal the limelight at the top meme coin. By stamping its authority as one of the top 10 cryptos despite previously being deemed an internet joke, DOGE has become a force to be reckoned with in crypto circles. With its roots being heavily embedded as a Doge ecosystem meme coin, Durag Doge has set the ball rolling as a coin that envisions a community filled with engagement, culture,and fun. Decentralization is also heavily embedded in $DURAG’s bloodstream since decisions related to its future direction, marketing, and development are community influenced. As a result, it has a vision of appreciating all crypto players from go-getters to hustlers since $DURAG appreciates the fact that big wins come from bold moves. Durag Doge Continues to Enjoy a Long-Term Bullish Picture Thanks to Floki’s well spelt out objective of combining the meme coin narrative with utility, the token has been on a rollercoaster ride, having recorded a year-to-date surge of 243.8% . FLOKI has a broad vision of creating a decentralized and autonomous ecosystem consisting of distinctive features, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Durag Doge is also not being left out when it comes to igniting the meme coin fire since it introduces a unique reward mechanism where staking with up to 20% APY becomes a reality. Some of Durag Doge’s core goals include driving a culture shift, fueling the hustle, and empowering the underdog. As a result, $DURAG envisions a future where meme coins aren’t just fleeting trends but cultural icons that unite people through shared energy, ambition, and joy. Conclusion It is now clear that meme coins have become a force to be reckoned with in the crypto sector since they are tied to trends, humor, and internet culture with Dogecoin, Floki, and Durag Doge sitting at the helm.

Investors are always searching for the next big thing, and meme coins continue to surprise everyone. Dogecoin, the original meme coin, has remained a strong player despite market fluctuations. But could it actually 10x sooner than expected? While many are watching DOGE closely, new meme coins like Dawgz AI are emerging with unique value propositions that could challenge the status quo. What Is Dogecoin and Why It Remains a Strong Contender Dogecoin started as a joke in 2013, but it quickly gained a loyal community and real-world adoption. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a capped supply, Dogecoin has an unlimited supply, meaning new coins are continuously minted. This initially led many to believe that it couldn’t hold value long-term. Yet, DOGE has defied expectations, largely thanks to its active community and high-profile endorsements. Another key factor in Dogecoin’s resilience is its low transaction fees and fast block times. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which can struggle with congestion and high fees, DOGE remains an efficient option for transactions. This usability has helped Dogecoin stay relevant, even as newer tokens enter the market. A Brief History of Dogecoin’s Rise to Fame Dogecoin’s journey has been nothing short of extraordinary. What started as an internet joke soon gained momentum when the Reddit and Twitter communities embraced it for tipping and donations. Over the years, DOGE went through multiple bull runs, notably in 2021 when Elon Musk’s tweets sent the price soaring from fractions of a cent to an all-time high of $0.73. Even though DOGE has since retraced, it remains one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies. The coin’s ability to generate hype—often driven by social media and high-profile endorsements—means it can quickly gain momentum again. And with new meme coins like Dawgz AI gaining traction, the competition is heating up. Why Dogecoin Still Holds Value in 2025 As we move into 2025, Dogecoin’s future remains promising for several reasons. First, major businesses like Tesla and AMC Theatres now accept DOGE as payment, increasing its real-world utility. Additionally, developers are actively working on improvements, including potential upgrades that could make Dogecoin even more competitive in the crypto space. Another reason for Dogecoin’s lasting value is its strong community support. Unlike many projects that fade away, DOGE has an army of supporters willing to rally behind it. This level of engagement keeps Dogecoin relevant and ensures it will likely remain a staple of the meme coin market. Dogecoin Price Predictions for 2025 and Beyond So, what’s next for DOGE? Many analysts believe Dogecoin could hit $1 in the next bull run, given its historical patterns and growing adoption. However, can it go even further? If momentum builds, there’s potential for a 10x return, especially if macroeconomic conditions favor cryptocurrencies. While Dogecoin remains a strong contender, new players like Dawgz AI are introducing innovative concepts to the meme coin space. As a result, investors are exploring opportunities beyond DOGE, diversifying into projects that offer additional value beyond just hype. Can DOGE Really 10x From Here A 10x increase from Dogecoin’s current price would require a major catalyst. Regulatory clarity, increased institutional adoption, and broader crypto market growth could all contribute to such a surge. Historically, DOGE has shown that when sentiment turns bullish, its price can skyrocket in a short period. However, competition from new meme coins means that investors are now looking for projects that offer more than just a recognizable brand. While DOGE could still see major gains, the rise of AI-driven tokens and other innovations could shift market dynamics. Analysts’ DOGE Price Forecasts for the Coming Years Crypto analysts have varying opinions on Dogecoin’s future price action. Some predict a conservative $0.50-$1 range in the next bull cycle, while more optimistic forecasts see $5 or higher if mass adoption continues. That said, many agree that meme coins are here to stay, and their market influence is growing. With projects like Dawgz AI attracting investor interest, the meme coin sector could see explosive growth beyond just Dogecoin. Factors That Could Influence Dogecoin’s Price The price of Dogecoin is influenced by a variety of factors, ranging from market sentiment to technological advancements. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, DOGE’s value is often dictated by community enthusiasm, social media trends, and endorsements from high-profile figures. While some investors see it as a speculative asset, others recognize its growing adoption in payment systems and online tipping. Moreover, external factors such as regulatory changes, macroeconomic conditions, and developments in the broader crypto market can also impact Dogecoin’s trajectory. As we move further into 2025, it’s essential to consider these dynamics when evaluating DOGE’s potential for significant gains. The Impact of Elon Musk and Social Media Trends One of the biggest wildcards in Dogecoin’s price movement is Elon Musk. As seen in previous bull runs, a single tweet from Musk can send DOGE soaring. His continued interest in integrating DOGE into Tesla and Twitter (now X) keeps speculation alive. Beyond Musk, social media trends play a major role. If meme culture continues to favor DOGE, it could see another massive price increase. However, if new meme coins gain popularity, Dogecoin’s dominance could be challenged. DOGE’s Utility and Real-World Adoption For Dogecoin to reach new highs, it must improve its real-world use cases. While businesses like Newegg and the Dallas Mavericks accept DOGE for payments, broader adoption is needed for sustained growth. Additionally, developments in blockchain technology—such as Layer 2 solutions—could improve Dogecoin’s efficiency and scalability, making it more attractive for everyday transactions. The Role of Meme Coins Like Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) in the Market As meme coins evolve, Dawgz AI is making waves with a fresh approach. Unlike traditional meme coins that rely solely on hype, Dawgz AI integrates AI-driven technology, setting it apart from many competitors. This innovation could drive significant interest from investors looking for the next big thing in crypto. With DAGZ gaining traction, it showcases how meme coins are no longer just a joke. Investors are increasingly looking at projects that combine community-driven momentum with technological advancements, and Dawgz AI fits this mold. Why Investors Are Eyeing Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) Beyond its meme appeal, Dawgz AI offers a unique combination of utility and growth potential. Its integration of AI-driven features adds real-world value, distinguishing it from other meme coins that rely purely on speculation. This technological edge has captured the attention of forward-thinking investors who seek projects with long-term viability. Additionally, the community-driven aspect of Dawgz AI plays a crucial role in its success. With an engaged user base and increasing visibility in the crypto space, $DAGZ stands as a strong contender in the evolving meme coin market. Those looking for the next big opportunity may find Dawgz AI to be a compelling investment. Final Thoughts – Will Dogecoin Make Millionaires Again Dogecoin’s ability to turn small investments into life-changing wealth has already been proven. Whether it can repeat this feat depends on multiple factors—market cycles, adoption rates, and social media influence. While Dogecoin remains a strong contender, investors are also looking toward emerging meme coins like Dawgz AI for fresh opportunities. If DOGE manages another 10x, it could once again create a new wave of millionaires. But with new players entering the scene, keeping an eye on innovations like Dawgz AI could be just as crucial for those looking to ride the next meme coin wave.

Let’s take a look at the Ethereum’s Time Price Opportunity (TPO) chart to determine two key levels where ETH could gravitate ahead of the first US Crypto Summit today. In Thursday’s late New York trading session, Trump signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and National Digital Asset Stockpile. Bitcoin (BTC) briefly hit $90K before this announcement but BTC price crashed as Trump signed the executive order. This caused the ETH price to drop down to $2,000. What’s next for Ethereum? Ethereum Price Today: When Will ETH Chop End? Ethereum (ETH) price is down 1.40% today and currently trades at $2.173 , continuing yesterday’s 1.75% drop. The last five days for ETH have been extremely choppy, with prices rallying as much as 13% in a day and then dropping 15% the next day. Choppy market conditions are when the price fails to establish a trend and consolidates with above-average volatility. Ethereum Price Forecast: ETH TPO Chart Shows 2 Key Levels to Watch Ahead of Crypto Summit According to TradingView , the Time Price Opportunity (TPO) is a “Market Profile” and is used to “analyze market activity by price level as it develops over time.” A TPO chart provides a different perspective on “market dynamics and the distribution of prices by visualizing the blocks of time spent at each of the profile’s price levels and the sequence of level traversals within the profile’s period.” Ethereum’s TPO chart shows two naked Points of control (nPOC) at $2,292 and $2,087. A POC is where the price spent the most time, and a naked POC shows that this level is untested after the day ended. Tagging this level leads to a strong reaction and can serve as support and resistance levels. Therefore, the $2,292 and $2,087 are two Ethereum price levels that investors need to keep an eye on ahead of the Crypto Summit today. ETH TPO Chart ETH Top-Down Analysis The Ethereum price chart with multiple time frame data lets us get a bird’s-eye view of what investors can expect next from ETH. The first three charts from the top left are the 1-month, 1-week and TPO charts. Following this are the 1-day and 4-hour charts. The monthly & weekly Ethereum price charts show three key levels. The monthly bearish imbalance , aka Fair Value Gap (FVG), at $2,551 . A key support level at $2,084 , a breakdown of which could lead to a bearish development that could push ETH price down to $1,000. The key resistance level at $2,857 , a breakout above this barrier will potentially lead to a retest of $4,000 or new highs. The TPO and daily chart further highlight the aforementioned nPOCs. The $2,292 and $2,349, serve as key short-term resistance levels . The nPOC at $2,087 serve as a stable support level . Finally, the four-hour chart clearly shows Ethereum price holding the $2,086 support level, which is key to establishing the next trend. If the Crypto Summit announces more positive developments surrounding the cryptocurrency ecosystem, ETH price could bounce from $2,086 and tag $2,808 , which closely coincides with the HTF levels noted on the monthly and weekly timeframe. Ethereum Price Top-Down Analysis Conclusion Ethereum price is experiencing volatility ahead of the White House Crypto Summit , with key levels to watch at $2,292 and $2,087 . A bullish Ethereum price forecast driven by an announcement at the summit could propel the ETH price higher to $3,000, while a lack of clarity might trigger a retreat below $2,000.

After a March 6 voting session, the Texas Senate passed the Bitcoin strategic reserve bill (SB-21) with a 25-5 vote . The proposal now moves to the state House, which must act on it by May 24. While the timeline allows for weeks of deliberation, some lawmakers may push to “expedite the process,” according to Satoshi Act Fund founder Dennis Porter, potentially bringing it to the governor’s desk sooner than expected. Dennis Porter @Dennis_Porter_ · Follow I just got a call from someone incredibly important in Texas. I was told the House intends to move very rapidly in Texas to pass ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’. We could have a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’ law very soon! Do not blink! 1:45 AM · Mar 7, 2025 2.5K Reply Copy link Read 132 replies If signed into law, Texas will become the first US state to hold Bitcoin as part of its financial reserves. SB-21 was first introduced in January by Texas State Senator Charles Schwertner as a Bitcoin-only bill. However, in February, lawmakers revised it to include broader language, opening the door for other digital assets. The changes followed US President Donald Trump’s executive order on Jan. 23, which called for a commission to study the feasibility of a “ digital asset stockpile .” What is SB-21? According to the bill, Texas would establish the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a special fund separate from the state treasury, overseen by the comptroller. The reserve would be used to acquire, hold, and manage Bitcoin and potentially other digital assets as part of the state’s financial strategy. Various sources, including state-allocated funds, investment earnings, private donations, and proceeds from Bitcoin-related rewards such as airdrops and blockchain forks, would fund the reserve. The bill also allows the comptroller to invest, sell, or manage the state’s Bitcoin holdings with the discretion of a “prudent investor.” A key provision in the bill requires that any cryptocurrency acquired must have an average market capitalisation of at least $500 billion over the past 12 months, effectively limiting investments to established assets like Bitcoin. The legislation also enables voluntary crypto donations from individuals or organisations, though the state reserves the right to reject any donation at its discretion. For now, the bill awaits debate in the Texas House. If it clears that hurdle, it will head to Governor Greg Abbott, a known supporter of Bitcoin and blockchain innovation. The bill is set to go into effect on September 1, 2025, if passed. According to Senator Schwertner, Bitcoin represents a “valuable, scarce asset” that could help Texas shore up its balance sheet. He argued that states no longer rely on “stacks of dollar bills in safes” like in the past but instead must look toward digital assets. Bitcoin reserve plans making steady progress Texas becomes the eighth state to move a crypto reserve bill to the House and joins North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Arizona, and New Hampshire. Texas’s bill was passed a day after New Hampshire’s House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee approved its crypto reserve bill with strong support. Meanwhile, on March 7, Trump signed an executive order establishing both a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “Digital Asset Stockpile.” The post Texas Senate approves bill to create Bitcoin reserve: Here’s what it means appeared first on Invezz",Crypto|Crypto regulation|Bitcoin|USA,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Invezz', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",invezz,2025-03-07 11:40:00

Reports are surfacing about a significant bug within Claude Code that has reportedly ‘bricked’ some user systems. For those in the cryptocurrency and tech space who depend on robust and reliable tools, this news raises serious questions about the stability and security of even the most anticipated AI innovations. Let’s dive into what exactly happened with this critical Claude Code bug and what it means for users and the broader AI landscape. What’s the Claude Code Bug That’s Causing System Failures? The issue stems from Claude Code’s auto-update feature, a function designed to keep the tool current and efficient. However, in a rather unfortunate oversight, this auto-update contained commands riddled with bugs. These problematic commands, when executed during the update process, wreaked havoc on systems where Claude Code was installed with ‘root’ or ‘superuser’ privileges. But what does ‘root’ or ‘superuser’ access mean in this context? Think of it as giving a program the keys to the kingdom. These permissions allow applications to make changes at the very core of an operating system. When Claude Code was granted this level of access, the buggy update commands were able to: Modify file directories that are typically off-limits to standard applications. Alter access permissions for critical system files, which control which programs and users can interact with them. In the most severe cases, render systems unstable and effectively ‘bricked’ them, meaning they became unusable without significant intervention. One GitHub user recounted their experience, stating they had to resort to using a ‘rescue instance’— essentially a system recovery mode—to manually repair the file permissions that Claude Code’s flawed commands had inadvertently broken. This highlights the severity of the AI bug and the potential disruption it caused for affected users. How Did Anthropic Respond to the ‘System Bricked’ Issue? Following the reports of system failures and widespread concern within the developer community, Anthropic acted to address the Claude Code bug . Here’s a breakdown of their response: Immediate Action: Anthropic promptly removed the problematic commands from Claude Code’s auto-update process to prevent further incidents of systems being ‘bricked’. Troubleshooting Guide: They created a troubleshooting guide to assist users who had already been affected by the bug and were experiencing system instability. This guide was made accessible via a link within the Claude Code program itself. Addressing Initial Missteps: Initially, the link to the troubleshooting guide contained a typo, adding a layer of frustration for users seeking immediate help. However, Anthropic confirmed that this error was quickly rectified. Anthropic’s swift response in removing the faulty update and providing a troubleshooting guide is a positive step. However, the incident underscores the critical importance of rigorous testing and quality assurance, especially when deploying tools with deep system access, like AI coding tools . The Broader Implications of the Claude Code Bug While Anthropic has addressed the immediate technical issue, the incident with the Claude Code bug raises some important considerations for the AI industry and users alike: Implication Description Trust and Reliability: Incidents like this can erode user trust in AI tools, particularly when they impact system stability and data integrity. Rebuilding this trust requires transparency and robust preventative measures. Importance of Testing: It highlights the absolute necessity for thorough testing and validation processes before releasing software updates, especially for tools that operate at a system level. Security Considerations: The episode serves as a reminder of the potential security vulnerabilities that can arise with complex software, and the importance of secure coding practices and update mechanisms. User Awareness and Permissions: It also brings to the forefront the need for users to be fully aware of the permissions they grant to applications, especially those requiring ‘root’ or ‘superuser’ access. For cryptocurrency and blockchain developers, who often work with sensitive systems and data, the reliability and security of development tools are paramount. The system bricked by a software bug incident serves as a cautionary tale, emphasizing the need for diligence in adopting and managing new technologies. Looking Ahead: Ensuring Stability in AI Tools The Claude Code incident is a valuable learning experience for both Anthropic and the broader AI development community. Moving forward, focusing on these key areas will be crucial: Enhanced Testing Protocols: Implementing more rigorous testing phases, including beta programs and extensive automated testing, can help catch bugs before they reach end-users. Staged Rollouts: Gradually rolling out updates to a subset of users initially can allow for real-world testing in a controlled environment, minimizing the impact of potential issues. Robust Fallback Mechanisms: Developing mechanisms to automatically revert to a stable version in case an update introduces critical errors can prevent system failures. Clear Communication: Maintaining open and transparent communication with users about potential issues, updates, and resolutions is essential for building and maintaining trust. In conclusion, while the Claude Code bug that led to systems being ‘bricked’ is undoubtedly a setback for Anthropic, their prompt response and the lessons learned from this experience are crucial for the ongoing development and adoption of reliable AI tools. For users in the fast-paced world of crypto and tech, staying informed about these developments and prioritizing security and stability remains more important than ever.

February 2025 recorded 172,017 job cuts, according to a Thursday report from coaching company Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which is a 103% increase compared to 2024, with the total year-to-date (YTD) layoffs hitting 221,812, the highest seen since 2009. The biggest shock is that government layoffs surged by 41,311% in just a year, an increase so big that the analysts had to double-check the numbers. In Washington, DC, alone, job cuts went from just 60 in 2024 to 61,795 in 2025, triggering an economic domino effect. The capital’s housing market is in free fall, jobless claims are piling up, and businesses dependent on federal contracts are collapsing under the pressure, per the report. D.O.G.E will crash the jobs market February’s 245% month-over-month increase in job cuts is now the highest monthly total since July 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, who said in the report that they expect these losses, plus the D.O.G.E cuts, to crash the US job market within the second quarter of this year. New unemployment claims surged by 22,000 in the last week of February, hitting 242,000 nationwide. The hardest-hit region is Washington, DC, where unemployment claims jumped 26% in just a week due to D.O.G.E layoffs. The city’s for-sale home inventory surged 31.6% year-over-year, surpassing the 2008 housing crisis high of 23.8%. Companies with government contracts are shedding workers as federal spending freezes leave projects in limbo, said Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The impact of D.O.G.E-related cuts is being felt beyond the labor market. Interest rates have dropped by 60 basis points in six weeks, and even as inflation remains high, the market is already anticipating a downturn. According to Labor Economist Julia Pollak, this trend is unusual. “Even in past downturns, we didn’t see federal job losses at this scale. The layoffs we’re seeing now could set the labor market back years.” The crisis is unfolding against a backdrop of Trump’s fast-changing tariff policies, combined with interest market volatility in crypto and stocks, are hurting corporate decision-making. On Thursday, the White House announced that it’ll be pausing some of the 25% the tariffs of Mexican and Canadian goods under USMCA until April 2. Economists are largely anticipating the levies will lead to potentially higher prices for consumers and slower growth. Data at the start of the year showed consumers trimmed spending in January and that businesses and consumers are becoming more pessimistic about the economy. The Trump administration is also restructuring federal hiring, making it harder for non-political appointees to secure jobs. Reports confirm that the White House is screening potential hires for loyalty to Trump’s second-term agenda. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that sanctions on Russian energy could be expanded, which would only make things worse. European leaders have also been briefed that Trump is linking a US-Ukraine minerals deal to a ceasefire with Russia, a decision that will have major geopolitical consequences. At the same time, US import surges are breaking records, with gold traders rushing bullion into New York depositories. This unexpected spike in gold imports has widened the US trade deficit, which brings additional pressure on domestic markets. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker acknowledged those risks yesterday, saying, “Business and consumer confidence is starting to wane, that’s not a good sign.” The Federal Reserve’s next meeting is scheduled for March 18-19, where chair Jerome Powell and his team will address the dangers of president Trump’s layoffs and determine whether interest rates should be cut after all, though they’ve said many times during recent meetings that they weren’t gonna do that anytime soon.

The annual report , compiled through a survey of state and provincial regulators across the United States and Canada, highlights the increasing sophistication of fraudulent schemes, particularly those exploiting digital platforms and artificial intelligence. Regulators have noted a significant rise in scams targeting investors through social media networks such as Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), Telegram, and WhatsApp. These platforms, traditionally used for social interaction and messaging, are now being leveraged by scammers to promote fraudulent investments using highly polished marketing materials. The deceptive nature of these scams has been further amplified by the use of AI-generated content, deepfake technology , and high-pressure emotional tactics to manipulate victims into parting with their funds. A 2024 @chainalysis report reveals that cryptocurrency scams defrauded victims of at least $9.9 billion, with AI-powered fraud and pig butchering scams surging by 40%. #CryptoScams #CryptoFraud #AI https://t.co/Mt5c5XXmOL — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 13, 2025 The Role of Social Media in Investment Scams Social media has become a fertile ground for financial scams, with fraudsters increasingly using online platforms to reach unsuspecting victims. According to NASAA’s findings, nearly 32% of scams originate from platforms like Facebook and X, while another 31% stem from messaging services like Telegram and WhatsApp. Video-based content, both long and short-form, is crucial in spreading deceptive schemes. Platforms like YouTube and Vimeo account for 14% of reported cases, whereas TikTok and Instagram Reels contribute another 19%. These digital avenues enable scammers to create professional-looking promotions that appear legitimate, often using sophisticated imagery and videos to lure investors. The deceptive nature of these scams is further compounded by psychological tactics, such as inducing a fear of missing out (FOMO) or exploiting emotional vulnerabilities. Romance and affinity scams have been particularly damaging, commonly called “pig butchering” schemes. Perpetrators initiate online relationships in these scams before coercing victims into fraudulent investments. Once the scammer has extracted enough funds, they disappear, leaving the victim financially devastated. AI and Deepfake Technology in Investment Fraud A growing concern among regulators is using artificial intelligence to facilitate scams. Nearly 39% of NASAA’s survey respondents expect AI-generated content, such as professional-looking graphics, videos, and promotional materials, to mislead investors significantly. Furthermore, 22% of regulators predict a rise in deepfake scams, where fraudsters use AI to create convincing images, videos, and voice recordings of celebrities or trusted figures to deceive potential victims. Deepfake scams have already infiltrated the crypto space, with criminals impersonating public figures like Elon Musk and Apple CEO Tim Cook to promote fraudulent crypto investment opportunities. The ability of AI to mimic realistic human interactions makes these scams increasingly difficult to detect, allowing fraudsters to build credibility and manipulate victims into investing. Notably, recent research by crypto exchange Bitget revealed a 245% increase in deepfake scams in 2024 , with over $24 billion lost to these types of scams. Additionally, Chainalysis also reported a 210% surge in deposits to pig butchering scams in 2024 . A separate report from web3 security firm Cyvers found that over $3.6 billion had been lost to such scams within the past year. According to a report from @CyverAlerts, Pig butchering crypto scams have cost victims a staggering $3.6 billion in 2024! #CryptoScams https://t.co/IRQy9YO9WB — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 27, 2024 NASAA continues to urge investors to remain vigilant and verify the legitimacy of investment opportunities before committing funds. The association advises checking with state, provincial, or territorial regulators to confirm the registration status of financial entities. Additionally, investors should be wary of high-pressure tactics, promises of guaranteed returns, and unsolicited investment offers, particularly those from social media and messaging platforms. “If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is,” Van Buskirk cautioned. “Investigate before you invest, and remember, being pressured to act quickly is a huge red flag.” As it stands now, crypto and artificial intelligence pose a growing threat, and regulators are working extensively to curb it and protect investors.

With XRP trading at $2.53 at the time of his post at 10:08 AM UTC, down from $2.60 on March 6 at 16:37 UTC, when the chart was captured, this 2.7% dip has sparked interest. The TD Sequential indicator is flashing multiple sell signals on the $XRP two-week chart, suggesting a potential shift in momentum! pic.twitter.com/SiyV454FIY — Ali (@ali_charts) March 7, 2025 The TD Sequential, a technical tool developed by Tom DeMark, is designed to spot trend exhaustion and reversals. Operating on a two-week timeframe, it’s a slow-moving signal that often marks significant turning points after prolonged moves. Martinez, who has cited the indicator’s reliability for XRP since 2022, implied that the token’s recent price action had hit a ceiling, with a pullback looming. The price movement between the chart’s timestamp at 16:37 UTC on March 6 and his post 17.5 hours later at 10:08 AM UTC on March 7, where XRP dipped from $2.60 to $2.53, aligns neatly with his bearish call. However, timing is critical in trading, and analysts can sometimes face scrutiny for presenting data in a way that fits their narrative after the fact. If the technical and on-chain analyst had posted the chart in real-time on March 6, the call would have carried more weight as a proactive signal, rather than appearing to wait for confirmation of the decline. XRP sell signal analysis Could the sell signals still be valid? Quite possibly. The TD Sequential’s two-week timeframe means it’s less sensitive to short-term fluctuations, like the $0.07 drop, and more focused on broader trends. Over the last seven days, the token surged 44.3% from $2.03 on March 1 to a high of $2.93 on March 3, accompanied by the highest volume recorded, signaling intense buying pressure that likely marked the initial exhaustion point. A secondary high of $2.65 on March 6, with a notable but lower volume spike, suggests a retest of resistance or a failed breakout attempt. The chart reveals a sharp red candlestick dropping to $2.50-$2.55 by March 7, reinforcing the reversal as sellers took control. XRP 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold The highest volume on March 3 likely completed a “9” setup in the TD Sequential, indicating the start of a potential reversal, while the March 6 volume spike and subsequent drop to $2.50-$2.53 could mark the beginning of a “13” countdown phase, confirming the earlier signal. This alignment supports Martinez’s assertion of multiple sell signals, with the broader trend suggesting the rally from $2.03 had run its course. Now the $2.50-$2.55 range on March 7 now serves as immediate support. A break below this level could target $2.40, signaling further downside and validating the bearish outlook.

While analysts say this news was already priced in, investors are expecting a rally. At this point, the expected bullish signal came from CryptoQuant. CryptoQuant analyst said that the Binance stablecoin reserve reached an all-time high, which is a positive sign for the market recovery. Accordingly, stablecoin (ERC-20) reserves on Binance exceeded $31.3 billion today, reaching an all-time high. He noted that an increase in the Binance stablecoin reserve generally indicates positive momentum. “When we see an increase in stablecoin reserves on Binance (currently the exchange with the highest trading volume), it shows positive momentum.” The analyst attributed the stablecoin surge on Binance to two important reasons. First, he cited investors preparing to enter the market. According to the analyst, investors choosing Binance for this and directing stablecoin liquidity to the exchange reflects confidence in the market and the exchange. The second reason, the analyst said, is that Binance is expanding its existing stablecoin reserves as demand increases. What is the Impact on Bitcoin and the Market? The CryptoQuant analyst said that periods of ATH and positive change in the stablecoin reserve are usually accompanied by a large increase in the Bitcoin price. At this point, the analyst, who expects the trend in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to change with the Binance stablecoin ATH, said, “Historically, periods when stablecoin reserves on Binance have increased have generally coincided with or even preceded increases in Bitcoin prices and a broader rise in the cryptocurrency market.” *This is not investment advice.

The proposal, authored by Multicoin Capital’s Tushar Jain and Vishal Kankani, along with Max Resnick, lead economist at Anza, aims to replace Solana’s fixed inflation schedule with a system that adjusts token emissions based on staking participation. Currently, Solana follows a fixed inflation schedule, starting at 4.6% annually and decreasing by 15% each year until stabilizing at 1.5%. New Proposal Suggests a More Flexible Approach SIMD-0228 suggests a more flexible approach, increasing emissions when staking participation falls below a 33% threshold and reducing emissions when staking levels are high. The reasoning behind this model is that a higher staking rate signals sufficient network security, allowing for lower rewards and reduced inflation. Supporters argue that this mechanism would make SOL scarcer and more valuable, benefiting long-term holders while preventing excessive token dilution. Under the proposed model, with the current staking rate of 65%, inflation could drop below 1% annually. If staking levels fall to the 33% threshold, the inflation rate would rise to incentivize participation. The proposal is expected to undergo voting in epoch 753, with discussions intensifying among Solana’s leadership and broader ecosystem participants. Notably, Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko and Helius founder Mert Mumtaz have voiced support for SIMD-0228, with Mumtaz arguing that it would strengthen the network. He noted that even if the proposal does not pass, the extensive debate surrounding it will contribute to the ecosystem’s maturity. I think SIMD 228 should pass because I believe it makes the network stronger but even if it doesn't pass — it's good to see strong public discussions from both sides that are always solution-seeking Solana has grown up before our eyes — mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) March 4, 2025 Helius also published an in-depth analysis examining the proposal’s potential implications. However, not all voices in the Solana community are convinced. Solana Foundation president Lily Liu has expressed skepticism, describing SIMD-0228 as “too half-baked” and warning that its unpredictable staking yields could deter institutional investors. She has called for a broader reassessment of the proposed model before implementation. In response, the proposal’s authors defended the plan, stating that it has undergone nearly two months of discussions and has incorporated various inputs from the community. Solana ETF Competition Heats Up It is worth noting that competitors are moving swiftly with their Solana ETFs. Investment giant Franklin Templeton recently filed a registration for the Franklin Solana Trust in Delaware. The filing follows similar applications from Canary Capital and Grayscale, both of which have already been acknowledged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). VanEck was the first to propose a Solana ETF in June 2024 , prompting a series of filings from major asset managers. However, BlackRock has remained noticeably absent from the race for a Solana ETF . Notably, Regulatory hurdles could significantly impact the timeline for a Solana ETF. Despite these challenges, Bloomberg ETF analysts estimate a 70% chance of Solana ETFs gaining SEC approval.

Here’s What Expert Says,https://thecoinrise.com/will-bitcoin-break-its-ath-by-june-heres-what-expert-says/,"The chances of Bitcoin surpassing its all-time high of $109,000 by June remain promising, but the market must first navigate macroeconomic uncertainties, according to Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten. “I think there’s more than a 50% chance we will see all-time highs before the end of June this year,” Klippsten said in a recent interview. However, he noted that investors need time to digest economic shifts, particularly U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent tariff announcements and lingering inflation concerns. “The market needs to first digest tariffs, trade war fears, and growth scare fears,” Klippsten said. “Bitcoin trading below $100,000 right now feels like a pause, not an end to the bull run.” Macroeconomic Volatility At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $89,210, according to CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency has slipped nearly 14% since February-start, when Trump introduced tariffs on imports from China, Canada, and Mexico. Despite this downturn, Klippsten remains optimistic, arguing that institutional demand remains strong and that Bitcoin’s recent breakout above $100,000 in December 2024 still holds significance. “Macroeconomic uncertainty is creating short-term noise, but the long-term trend remains bullish.” Bitcoin to Consolidate Before Rallying After hitting a record high of $73,679 in March 2024, Bitcoin moved sideways for eight months before surging past $100,000 in December, following Trump’s election victory. However, recent policy decisions have triggered another period of price consolidation. BTC recently dipped below $85,000 after Trump signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . The order fell short of market expectations, merely confirming that the U.S. government would not sell its BTC holdings without offering specifics on future acquisitions. As Bitcoin stabilizes, network economist Timothy Peterson predicts the asset will likely trade between $85,000 and $95,000 for the next six to twelve weeks before gradually reclaiming higher levels. Meanwhile, Bitwise Invest CEO Hunter Horsley downplayed concerns about Bitcoin’s pullback, drawing parallels to January 2024, when BTC briefly dipped after the launch of spot ETFs before rebounding to new highs. “Bitcoin sold off on Bitcoin ETFs launching. And then went on to a new ATH. Traders gonna trade,” Horsley remarked in a March 7 X post. The post Will Bitcoin Break Its ATH by June?

41279370,41f177ad-d21d-4fc5-97d1-0cbc71009cdf,1741348476,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/41279370.jpeg,"Bitcoin, Ether, Solana Traders Chase Downside Protection, XRP Stands Out, as Trump's Crypto Plan Disappoints",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/07/bitcoin-ether-solana-traders-chase-downside-protection-xrp-stands-out-as-trump-s-crypto-plan-disappoints,"U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday to establish a digital asset reserve that retains bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins seized in enforcement actions without making new purchases. The absence of new purchases means that, for now, the so-called reserve serves merely as a strategic stockpile that will not inject any buying pressure in the market. That has traders feeling disappointed and chasing short-dated put options in BTC, ether (ETH) and solana (SOL), according to Deribit, data tracked by Block Scholes . The sentiment, however, remains resilient in XRP. A put option offers the buyer the right to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. In other words, it protects the buyer from potential price slides. Skews, which measure the difference in implied volatility (demand) between the so-called 25-delta (lower strike) puts and higher strike calls, show short-dated BTC, ETH, and SOL puts trading at a premium relative to calls. That's a sign of downside fears. ""Short-tenor skews for BTC, ETH, and SOL options once again express a demand for puts. April expiries and beyond, however, still maintain a bullish tilt for BTC and ETH, while XRP options hold a positive skew at all tenors longer than 1 week,"" Andrew Melville, research analyst at Block Scholes, told CoinDesk, adding that derivatives are largely mirrored the market's disappointment following Trump's long-awaited Strategic Reserve executive order. ""Both BTC and ETH’s term structures are flattening from the significantly inverted levels that has characterized most of March. At-the-money volatility levels at the front-end have dropped sharply by over 10 points as the market has priced out some of the uncertainty ahead of Friday's doubleheader of NFP and Crypto Summit,"" Melville added. Focus on crypto summit and payrolls data Traders are now looking forward to Friday's White House crypto summit to bring good news to the market. ""The outcomes could significantly influence the regulatory landscape and institutional sentiment toward digital assets, shifting toward clarity on token classification, tax incentives, and reduced enforcement actions, possibly dismantling barriers for banks and funds,"" Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, said in an email. Key market signals to watch include concrete guidelines on securities laws, the reserve’s structure, regulatory leniency from figures like SEC’s Mark Uyeda, and hints of legislative backing—each capable of driving a bullish surge or, if vague, sparking volatility,"" Lee added. The U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for February, due at 13:30 UTC, is eyed as well. The data is expected to show the pace of job creations improved to 160K from January's 143K, with the jobless rate holding steady at 4%. Meanwhile, the average hourly earnings are forecast to have risen 0.3% month-on-month in February, down from January's 0.5%, according to Reuters estimates tracked by FXStreet . A weaker-than-expected data would validate renewed hopes for at least three Federal Reserve rate cuts this year, potentially supporting risk assets, including BTC. However, the sustainability of gains is under question, given the inflationary impact of Trump's tariffs. ""The interest rate market has shifted expectations, now anticipating three rate cuts this year instead of just one. However, this outlook may be overly optimistic, as the Fed will likely prioritize monitoring Trump's impact on inflation. This process could take months, if not quarters, to fully assess. As a result, the Fed may maintain a neutral stance for the time being,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research , said in a note to clients Friday. ""Additionally, the ""Fed put""—the level at which the Fed would step in to support markets—could be set lower under Trump than it would be under a Kamala Harris or Joe Biden administration, meaning policymakers may tolerate more market volatility before intervening,"" Thielen added.",Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|Solana|XRP|Bitcoin Strategic Reserve,EN,0,0,BTC|SOL|MARKET|XRP|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-07 11:54:36

41279136,https://coinpedia.org/?p=429145,1741348612,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,"U.S. Government Confirms Bitcoin-Only Reserve, Excludes Ethereum, XRP, and Altcoins",https://coinpedia.org/news/u-s-government-confirms-bitcoin-only-reserve-excludes-ethereum-xrp-and-altcoins/,"The post U.S. Government Confirms Bitcoin-Only Reserve, Excludes Ethereum, XRP, and Altcoins appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Peter Schiff has confirmed that the U.S. government will not be purchasing Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Cardano (ADA), or Solana (SOL) for its crypto holdings. Instead, the recently established Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) will consist solely of seized Bitcoin (BTC), reinforcing its status as the dominant digital asset. While the executive order signed today leaves room for potential Bitcoin purchases, these would likely require congressional approval. Altcoins Are Excluded from the Reserve Earlier reports had suggested that a “crypto reserve” might include XRP, ADA, SOL, and ETH, causing a surge in their prices. Meanwhile, as per today’s update, the U.S. government has created a Digital Asset Stockpile for altcoins like XRP, Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana, but it won’t buy more—it’s only keeping what’s seized through legal actions. Managed separately by the Treasury, these assets may be held or sold based on regulations. Meanwhile, Bitcoin gets a dedicated Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), reinforcing its status as a key asset. An audit within 30 days will reveal the government’s total crypto holdings and organize them into the appropriate reserves, highlighting Bitcoin’s priority over altcoins. However, Schiff clarified that the government will not be actively acquiring these assets. Instead, the government will create a separate “Digital Asset Stockpile” for forfeited altcoins, but no new tokens will be added beyond those already seized. Moreover, data from Arkham also confirms the U.S. owns zero XRP, SOL, and ADA, meaning the earlier expectation of a broader crypto reserve has been completely dismissed. Whereas, crypto analyst Moon Lambo suggests the U.S. might already own some XRP, ETH, ADA, or SOL from lesser-known forfeitures, but if so, the amounts are likely very small and insignificant. The United States could own a bit of all of those coins right now from forfeitures that we're unaware of. There may be court cases that weren't highly publicized that we haven't heard about. Even if so, I suspect the amounts of these coins held will be pretty miniscule. — Moon Lambo (@MoonLamboio) March 7, 2025 What Does the Government Currently Hold? The U.S. government currently holds close to 200,000 BTC , obtained through various seizures. While this Bitcoin reserve remains the primary focus, the government also possesses around $176 million worth of ETH and $27 million worth of BNB. However, XRP, ADA, and SOL have not been forfeited, raising questions about their inclusion in the stockpile. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump’s Plan to Buy Bitcoin For Its Reserve: Here’s How the US Might Do It! , Market Reactions and Future Implications The crypto community, particularly Bitcoin advocates, have praised the government’s move, as it differentiates BTC from other cryptocurrencies. This development strengthens Bitcoin’s perception as “digital gold” and further legitimizes it as a strategic asset. However, the exclusion of major altcoins has disappointed investors who previously speculated on their inclusion. Moving forward, the government’s approach to crypto remains a key area of interest, especially regarding whether Bitcoin purchases will be approved and how the Digital Asset Stockpile will be managed. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The initiative, which was unveiled on March 2, aims to establish a national reserve of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies such as XRP, Solana, Cardano, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. Hoskinson revealed that he found out about ADA’s inclusion at the same time as the public, adding that neither he nor any representatives from Cardano were consulted in advance. He emphasized that the lack of prior communication was surprising, considering the significance of the announcement. LATEST: Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson said he wasn’t aware that President Trump would include $ADA in his proposed crypto reserve until the day it was announced. He also claimed that neither he nor any Cardano representatives had received an invitation to the White House… pic.twitter.com/PXmJHjUaRU — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 6, 2025 Lack of White House Engagement with Cardano In addition to being left out of discussions about the crypto reserve, Hoskinson noted that neither he nor anyone from Cardano had been invited to the upcoming White House Crypto Summit . The event will bring together key figures from the cryptocurrency industry and government officials to discuss regulatory and policy matters. However, as of his latest statement, Cardano has not been invited. This omission raises questions about the administration’s engagement strategy with the broader blockchain industry. Other major players, such as Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, are reportedly attending, alongside representatives from companies linked to XRP and Solana.

Similarly, other cryptocurrencies included in the reserve, such as XRP and SOL, experienced significant price increases. The news reinforced speculation about potential regulatory shifts and the growing role of digital assets in government-backed initiatives. While the announcement positively impacted market sentiment, the lack of direct communication with key stakeholders like Cardano has some in the community concerned. However, some in the community see advantages in this situation. One commenter pointed out that ADA’s inclusion even without Hoskinson’s prior knowledge, shows the digital asset’s growing influence in the crypto space. He also noted that not being invited to the summit does not take away from ADA’s strengths like its focus on decentralization, utility, and sustainability. Hoskinson has previously revealed that he has a direct line of communication with the president and may still receive an invitation before the event begins.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As ETH and LINK push past resistance levels, BitLemons is gaining traction with its GambleFi protocol, capturing investors’ attention. Table of Contents Has BitLemons found the formula for sustainable growth? Is Chainlink positioning for a new all-time high? When will Ethereum break its resistance? Conclusion As Ethereum’s technical breakthroughs and Chainlink’s double-digit gains dominate headlines, savvy investors are quietly positioning themselves in BitLemons (BLEM) before it hits exchanges. With its GambleFi protocol already generating revenue, dual security audits, and a presale that’s 49% complete in Stage 2, BLEM offers a ground-floor access to what analysts predict could be crypto’s next massive growth story. Has BitLemons found the formula for sustainable growth? BitLemons is disrupting the $450 billion traditional casino market with its GambleFi protocol that’s already operational with over 8,000 games from premium providers including Evolution and Pragmatic. Unlike speculative tokens, BitLemons generates revenue 24/7 while allocating 30% of all Gross Gaming Revenue directly to token holders — 15% through strategic buyback and burn mechanisms creating deflationary pressure, and 15% as high-yield staking rewards. With dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof (validation that competitors may not match) and $1 million raised in its private seed round, BitLemons has massive momentum. Stage 1 sold out in 16 days, and Stage 2 is already 49% complete at $0.02 per token, with over $1.62 million raised. With fewer than 17 million tokens remaining before the price increases to $0.03 in 13 days and industry insiders projecting a listing price between $0.17 – $0.18, early investors are positioning themselves for potential 8-9x returns from current levels. You might also like: Can BitLemons’ presale momentum outpace Cardano and TRUMP in 2025? Is Chainlink positioning for a new all-time high? Chainlink has demonstrated remarkable resilience, trading at $16.41 with an 8.90% surge over the past week. The decentralized oracle network continues to expand its ecosystem, establishing itself as a critical infrastructure connecting smart contracts with real-world data. LINK’s technical indicators reveal a decisive breakout above key resistance levels, accompanied by a high trading volume of $1.14b. The token has established strong support at the $15.00 level while facing resistance near $17.50. With a market capitalization now exceeding $10.40b and bullish sentiment at 87%, institutional interest continues to flow into the project as it cements its position as an essential blockchain infrastructure. When will Ethereum break its resistance? Ethereum has been steadily reclaiming lost ground, trading at $2,126.64 with a 1.2% gain over the past day. Despite recent security concerns — including reports of hackers linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group laundering nearly 500,000 ETH — the market remains optimistic about Ethereum’s fundamentals. ETH’s $254.82b market cap is supported by a significant trading volume of $19.49b, signaling renewed investor confidence in the smart contract platform. The launch of the Pectra upgrade testnet has bolstered expectations for improved scalability and transaction efficiency, addressing long-standing user concerns. Key support has formed at $2,100 with resistance around $2,300, suggesting a potential continuation of the upward trajectory if market conditions remain favorable. Conclusion While Ethereum and Chainlink present compelling cases for continued growth, BitLemons stands apart with its revenue-generating platform already in operation. At $0.02 in Stage 2 and analysts projecting listing prices of $0.17 – $0.18, the mathematical advantage becomes clear. With Stage 2 already 49% complete and 13 days remaining until the next price increase, the ground-floor opportunity is disappearing. The question savvy investors are asking is how substantial a position to establish before this window closes. For more information on BitLemons, visit the website or socials .

XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically tailored for rapid and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The extent of adoption and Ripple’s strides in forging strategic partnerships are pivotal in shaping XRP’s value trajectory. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has dropped as the selling influx was abruptly taken, suppressing the price to $2.49 during the day. The RSI dropped to 49.54; at the same time but remains in neutral territory How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $3.85 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to double. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the middle of next year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.84, achieved on January 7, 2018. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a lesser chance of reaching $20 by 2031. Though, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, which still makes it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $16.69 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Ripple announced that it is partnering with BDACS in Korea. BDACS will use Ripple custody for secure infrastructure for XRP, RLUSD, and other crypto assets. The network said the partnership will help institutional and XRPL developer growth. XRP partners with BDACS XRP is one of the most trending cryptocurrencies at the moment. XRP’s recent surge in popularity has ignited speculation of a price jump to $100 among enthusiasts, while some analysts remain skeptical.

XRP historic price sentiment Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. XRP price history Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022 it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP achieved a peak price of $3.19 and was trading near the $2.90 level in February, while it has stepped down to $2.1 in March.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-07 12:00:08

Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, was not invited to Trump’s March 7 White House crypto summit, raising concerns about his role in future regulatory discussions. ADA Heads South Cardano’s native token took center stage on March 3, with its price exploding by 60% daily and reaching over $1.10. The substantial resurgence resulted from Donald Trump’s statement that his administration will move forward with establishing a strategic crypto reserve that will include ADA (among other leading cryptocurrencies). Several hours ago, the US president signed the executive order on the initiative. However, ADA was not included in the order as it was solely focused on bitcoin. Some industry participants previously warned that Trump’s eventual green light may result in a “sell the news” scenario. ADA plunged to as low as $0.82 before rebounding to the current $0.88 (per CoinGecko’s data), which represents a 6% decline on a 24-hour scale. The asset’s market capitalization is around $31 billion, meaning it remains the eighth-biggest in the sector, surpassing Dogecoin (DOGE). ADA Price, Source: CoinGecko Another factor that may have triggered downward pressure on ADA’s valuation is the upcoming crypto summit. The gathering will be held at the White House later today (March 7) and will supposedly be joined by multiple crypto leaders, including Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Coinbase’s boss Brian Armstrong, Strategy’s Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, and more. Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, was also rumored to be among the participants. Earlier this week, though, he disclosed that he hadn’t received an invitation for the event. Several months ago, Hoskinson revealed his intentions to work alongside Trump’s administration to create a comprehensive and potentially more favorable regulatory environment for the cryptocurrency sector. However, his exclusion from the guest list may hamper that ambition. Waiting for These Bullish Factors Despite ADA’s retreat in the past hours, some elements suggest that the asset could rise to new peaks soon. One example is the potential support coming from Gemini. Tyler Winklevoss (co-founder of the US-based crypto exchange) recently hinted that ADA might be listed on the platform. Such a development would increase the token’s liquidity and accessibility and may spark upward pressure on the price. Another factor is the possible launch of a spot ADA exchange-traded fund (ETF) in America. The world’s largest digital asset manager, Grayscale, filed with the US SEC to introduce that type of product in mid-February, and the Commission acknowledged the application a few weeks later. This investment vehicle would allow investors to gain exposure to the asset without dealing with exchanges or worrying about self-custody. According to Polymarket, the approval odds before the end of 2025 stand at roughly 70%.

41279231,https://coingape.com/?post_type=markets&p=242819,1741348868,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"BTC, ETH, XRP Price Prediction as the US Dollar Index Crashes Ahead of NFP Data",https://coingape.com/markets/btc-eth-xrp-price-prediction-as-the-us-dollar-index-crashes-ahead-of-nfp-data/,"Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) pulled back slightly on Friday as focus shifted to the US nonfarm payrolls (NFP) data and Donald Trump’s crypto summit. BTC price retreated 2%, while ETH and XRP fell by 4.2% and 1.32%. This retreat could fade if the US publishes weak NFP data, which will lead to more US dollar index sell-off. US Dollar Index Crashes Ahead of Nonfarm Payrolls Data BTC, ETH, and XRP prices retreated even as the US dollar index (DXY) tumbled to the lowest level since November 5. It fell to $103.6, down by about 6% from its highest level this year as hopes that the Federal Reserve will slash interest rates rose. US Dollar Index The nonfarm payrolls data will likely provide more color about this. Economists expect the data to reveal that the labor market softened in February as tariff fears rose and as Elon Musk led a purge of the federal workforce. On Wednesday, a report by ADP showed that the private sector created 77k jobs, much lower than the expected 154k. A weak labor report will increase the odds that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates more times than expected. A dovish Fed would lead to a softer US dollar index, which would in turn propel Bitcoin’s price higher. In an X post, Jamie Coutts, the Chief Crypto Analyst at RealVision said : “ When looking at this recent move in the DXY through a historical lens, it’s challenging to be anything but bullish . I ran a signal screen for 3-day negative moves of more than 2% & -2.5% and found they have all occurred at Bitcoin bear market troughs (inflection points) or mid-cycle bull markets (trend continuations). “ Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple prices will react to the Trump crypto summit . While this summit will be bullish for crypto, a pullback cannot be ruled out since market participants have already priced in it. BTC, ETH, XRP Price Predictions The crypto market will be in the spotlight after the US NFP and crypto summit. So, let’s explore some of the support and resistance levels of popular coins like BTC, ETH, and XRP prices. BTC Price Forecast The daily chart shows that BTC price is holding steady above the support at $85,000 and the 200-day Exponential Moving Average. It is also steadily above the lowest level this month. At the same time, Bitcoin has faced stiff resistance between $93,000 and $95,000. BTC needs to surge above that resistance to confirm more gains to the psychological point at $100,000. A drop below the 200-day moving average at $85,850 will invalidate the bullish outlook and risk dropping to this month’s low at $78,100. BTC Price Chart ETH Price Technical Analysis Ethereum price is hanging at a crucial support level ahead of the nonfarm payrolls data . It is trading at $2,190, a few points above the key support level at $2,123, the lowest swing on February 3, September, 6, and August 5 last year. That is a sign that there is an indecision among bulls and bears, with bears being fearful of going short below that level. The most bearish Ethereum price forecast will be confirmed if it drops below the year-to-date low of $1,996. A drop below that level will confirm the triple-top pattern that formed on the weekly chart and point to more downside. A bullish view will be confirmed if it moves above $2,553, the highest swing on May 2. ETH Price Chart XRP Price Technical Analysis Like Bitcoin, XRP price does not have a well-defined trend ahead of the nonfarm payrolls data. On the daily chart, there are signs that it has formed a head and shoulders pattern, a popular bearish sign. XRP Price Chart This pattern means that the Ripple price prediction is bearish as long as it remains below the right and left shoulders at $2.90. This means that Ripple may crash below $2 as that CoinGape article predicted.

This step strengthens POPG’s presence in the web3 space, increasing accessibility for users and reinforcing the project’s long-term vision. LBank, an established exchange, provides a platform for POPG’s expansion. As the first exchange listing, this marks the beginning of a larger rollout aimed at making $POPG widely accessible. With LBank's global reach, more users can now seamlessly buy, trade and stack $POPG, supporting increased adoption and integration within the POPG ecosystem. However, this is just the first step—more exchange listings are coming soon, further expanding accessibility for the token and the ecosystem. The Right Move at the Right Time For any web3 project, exchange listings are essential for building trust and market visibility. With $POPG as the backbone of the POPG entertainment ecosystem, accessibility plays a role in enabling users to engage with its three core platforms. POP.VIP is already live, allowing users to benefit from up to 14% rebates by saving $POPG on the platform. POP.GAME is the next to launch—a responsible iGaming platform where the community will contribute ideas and input to create the best iGaming experience possible. POP.LIVE, a platform for exclusive access to premium events at original prices, will follow at a later stage, further enhancing the entertainment value of the ecosystem. $POPG holds real value as the utility token of the POPG ecosystem, enabling access to exclusive rewards, entertainment experiences, and community-driven initiatives. POPG successfully completed its IDO on KingdomStarter (KDG), with strong participation and interest from the community. All allocated tokens were sold out within 24 hours, while 60% of the allocation was snapped up in less than 45 minutes — reflecting the community’s belief in POPG’s vision. This has set the stage for the next phase of POPG’s growth, as the project moves forward with a strategic roadmap aimed at scaling adoption and utility. Built for the long term, POPG has a clear strategy to bridge entertainment, web3, and community-driven experiences. Exchange accessibility is just one part of a broader effort to ensure a sustainable, user-driven ecosystem where fans benefit from true ownership and engagement. The team extends a huge thank you to the POPG community and supporters who have been with the project every step of the way. The journey is just getting started, and many more milestones lie ahead. Stay tuned—POPG is here to redefine entertainment in web3. About POPG POPG came into this world as a solution to address the real world problems, to meet the demands of the growing entertainment industry all while harnessing the power of Web3 technology.

Now SpacePay is making this a reality with their clever payment solution featuring a tiny 0.5% transaction fee, compatibility with over 325 crypto wallets, and instant conversion to regular currency for merchants. No wonder they’ve already pulled in nearly $1 million in their presale , with each $SPY token going for $0.003126. Bridging the Gap Between Crypto and Everyday Commerce Crypto and regular payments have been like awkward strangers at a party for years. Shop owners get nervous about accepting digital coins because of the technical headaches and wild price swings. SpacePay’s approach is refreshingly simple. Instead of forcing merchants to buy expensive equipment or learn complicated systems, their solution works with regular Android payment terminals through a basic software update. Customers can use practically any crypto wallet they already have and just scan a QR code like they would with Apple Pay. Behind the scenes, SpacePay handles all the complicated stuff while everyone gets an experience that feels totally normal. There’s no need to monitor crypto market conditions, manage digital wallets, or understand blockchain technology. Clock is ticking pic.twitter.com/toIsIP2VF2 — SpacePay (@SpacePayLtd) February 17, 2025 Solving the Volatility Challenge for Merchants The elephant in the room with crypto payments has always been those crazy price swings. No restaurant owner wants to accept Bitcoin for a $100 meal only to find it’s worth $80 by closing time. SpacePay tackles this head-on with a clever solution. When someone pays with crypto, the system immediately converts it to regular money. The merchant gets exactly what they charged, whether Bitcoin crashes or moons five minutes later. Here’s how it works. SpacePay freezes the exchange rate during the few seconds it takes to process a payment. If the market swings wildly during that tiny timeframe, SpacePay absorbs the difference. Merchants just see reliable payments landing in their accounts. Game-Changing Economics with 0.5% Transaction Fees Anyone who’s run a business knows the pain of credit card processing fees. Those 2.5% to 3.5% charges take a massive bite out of already thin profit margins. It’s like working one full day each month just to pay your payment processor. With a transaction fee of only 0.5%, SpacePay completely transforms the traditional payment model. That’s not a typo – it’s really that low. For a neighborhood restaurant doing $50,000 in monthly sales, switching to SpacePay could put an extra $1,500 back in their pocket every month. They can charge so much less by cutting out the middlemen. Traditional payment systems pass your money through multiple hands before reaching its destination. SpacePay creates a direct path between customer and merchant, using blockchain technology to maintain security without the extra costs. The $SPY Token Ecosystem and Benefits The $SPY token isn’t just another crypto coin. It’s more like a membership card that grows in value as the SpacePay network expands. Token holders get some sweet perks: monthly rewards based on platform usage, voting rights on important decisions, and first access to new features. Perhaps most appealing is the revenue-sharing model – token holders actually earn a slice of those transaction fees. Looking at the token distribution shows SpacePay is thinking long-term. They’ve set aside 20% for the public presale, 17% for user rewards, 18% each for marketing and partnerships, 10% for development, and 12% in reserve. The founding team only keeps 5%, showing they’re focused on building something lasting rather than making a quick buck. Joining the SpacePay Payment Revolution Getting involved with SpacePay starts at their official website , where you can connect your cryptocurrency wallet – whether that’s MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or another popular option. If you don’t have a crypto wallet yet SpacePay accepts traditional bank card payments too. The platform takes various cryptocurrencies including USDT, AVAX, ETH, BNB, MATIC, and BASE. The current token price sits at $0.003126, though this figure may increase as the presale progresses through its various stages. The days of crypto being just for traders and tech enthusiasts are fading fast. With solutions like SpacePay, we’re moving toward a world where digital currencies work seamlessly alongside traditional payment methods – making life easier for both businesses and customers along the way.

This development follows President Donald Trump’s signing of an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile. The Potential Advantages of a BTC Reserve White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks revealed the development in a Thursday post on X. Reacting to the news, Matt Hougan highlighted the impact that the establishment would have. The Bitwise investment head stated that the approval would significantly lower the chances of the U.S. government ever banning Bitcoin. He also suggested that it would accelerate the pace at which countries consider setting up such reserves, as they might see a short-term opportunity to act before potential additional purchases by the country. Further, he emphasized that the decision would make it much more difficult for institutions, including national account advisor platforms and quasi-governmental agencies like the IMF, to portray Bitcoin as risky or unsuitable for holding. Michael Saylor, founder of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), has previously stated that such an initiative would establish the United States as a leader in cyberspace. He emphasized that it is not only about accumulating BTC but also about securing a dominant position in the digital economy. Meanwhile, Hougan has consistently been bullish about the idea. In a previous memo, he suggested that it could drive a major shift in global monetary policy and institutional investment. Amidst some negative sentiment over whether it would include a mix of digital assets, he has urged investors to recognize its potential to reshape the regulatory environment in favor of crypto. Crypto Market Reacts Trump’s executive order establishes a stockpile that would not use taxpayer money to acquire cryptocurrencies. Instead, it will be funded exclusively with Bitcoin confiscated in criminal and civil forfeiture cases. The government will also not acquire additional assets for the reserve beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings. This means that it will not be buying Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), or Cardano (ADA), as the president had mentioned earlier this week. Meanwhile, reacting to the news, the total crypto market capitalization is now back below $3 trillion. BTC is down 4.7% at $88,000 after hitting a day’s low of $84,717. ETH dropped 5.8% to $2,169. Among altcoins, SOL fell 5%, XRP slipped 1.5%, and ADA dropped 10%.

Brazil’s Federal Data Processing Service (SERPRO) has partnered with the Cardano Foundation, opening doors for massive blockchain adoption. Will this partnership impact Cardano’s price up to $2? Cardano Partner With SERPRO Cardano Foundation, the non-profit organization pushing for Cardano’s adoption, has announced a strategic partnership with SERPRO, Brazil’s leading government technology provider. SERPRO manages digital solutions for over 90% of the federal administration, meaning this collaboration could introduce blockchain to a massive user base. This partnership will focus on two main areas. First, it will educate SERPRO’s 8,000 employees through Cardano Academy, offering training and masterclasses on blockchain technology. Second, Cardano’s network will be integrated into SERPRO’s services, potentially enhancing transparency and efficiency in Brazil’s government operations. Why This Partnership Is a Big Deal? SERPRO is responsible for over 750 digital solutions, processes more than 33 billion transactions per year, and manages massive amounts of government data. If Cardano successfully integrates its blockchain into SERPRO’s systems, it could set an example for other countries to follow. This isn’t Cardano’s first step in Brazil. Back in December 2023, the foundation partnered with Petrobras, the country’s largest petroleum corporation, to provide blockchain education to its employees. These moves show Cardano’s long-term vision of becoming a key player in the government sector. ADA’s Price Outlook Despite this major announcement, Cardano’s ADA token has struggled, dropping 8% in the last 24 hours to $0.88. However, according to analyst Ali Martinez, ADA has been forming a right-angled descending broadening wedge pattern since December 2023. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1897927448999714990 As per Martinez, if ADA manages to break the $1.14 resistance level, it could trigger a price surge to $2.",News,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-07 12:06:36

41279629,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/in-pocket-staking-vengas-vision-for-easy-and-accessible-crypto-rewards,1741349457,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/41279629.jpeg,In-Pocket Staking: Venga’s Vision for Easy and Accessible Crypto Rewards,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/in-pocket-staking-vengas-vision-for-easy-and-accessible-crypto-rewards,"Staking is often said to be crypto’s equivalent of a high-interest savings account. It’s about putting your digital assets to work. So instead of just holding them in your wallet, where they’re not doing anything, you can use them to invest in the health of the underlying network and get paid for doing so. With staking, the more crypto you stake, the higher the rewards will be, with some networks offering rates that go well above and beyond anything you might get from a traditional bank savings account. When staking first appeared, it was pretty difficult to get involved. Originally, to be able to stake crypto you had to become a network validator, which meant investing in some powerful hardware. It also required technical skills to install and run the necessary software to support the network. There were also significant minimum stakes required to become a validator. For instance, to become an Ethereum validator, one must stake at least 32 ETH , which is around $74,000 at today’s rate. Staking Made Simple Fortunately, staking is no longer such a challenge thanks to the emergence of in-app staking via Venga . Through the Venga Earn function on Venga’s all-in-one crypto app, staking is made so easy that anyone can do it. Gone are the technical requirements, the minimum stakes and other barriers to entry. Now, staking is as simple as making a couple of clicks, paving the way for much broader participation in the blockchain economy. The beauty of the Venga app is that you only have to buy some cryptocurrency in the first place. Once you’ve loaded up on crypto, you can immediately start putting those funds to work, earning yourself a passive income for supporting the network. The act of staking in Venga’s wallet couldn’t be simpler. Simply select a compatible token, click on “stake”, then select a staking pool based on its reputation and the advertised APY. Then, select the desired amount of tokens you’d like to lock up and click “confirm”. That’s all you need to do. When you stake tokens in a staking pool, what you’re doing is pooling your tokens together with those of its other participants. It works kind of like a savings group, only it’s crypto native. By joining forces in this way, pool members increase their chances of being able to generate new blocks and earn rewards, which are then shared between every member of the pool. With Venga’s Earn feature, you can lock up your Ethereum (ETH) tokens for a minimum of 120-days, and you’ll earn an APY of 3.2% on the amount of tokens you have staked. While there’s only one option for now, Venga plans to roll out additional staking options where users can increase their APY in return for a longer time commitment. Soon, Venga will add lots of other tokens for stakers, with Polygon’s MATIC, SOL, AVAX, LINK and AAVE just some of the cryptocurrencies set to launch in the coming weeks. How Are Rewards Calculated? Venga staking rewards will depend on a number of factors, including the amount of crypto you stake. By locking up more tokens, you increase your contribution to the network, so you can earn more handsome rewards. Also, locking-up your tokens for longer shows you’re more committed, and in return you qualify for a higher APY. Other factors that impact your Venga earnings include the total amount of tokens staked on the entire network. If there are millions of tokens staked by hundreds of thousands of people around the world, the rewards are going to be shared across all of these participants. As such, the available rewards may decrease, although this also depends upon the level of network activity. In addition, it’s important to note that networks sometimes adjust their staking rewards due to token inflation, or to increase incentives if not enough people are securing it. It’s often the case that newer blockchains offer higher APY, to encourage users to stake there. However, such networks come with higher risks. Finally, you’ll need to consider the validator’s performance. When you enter a staking pool on Venga, you’re backing a specific validator, whose job it is to validate transactions. So look for a validator with high accuracy and uptime to ensure you are maximizing the value of your stake. Is Staking Risky? Staking can be risky. The main thing to remember is that your rewards are paid out in the same cryptocurrency that you stake. So if the value of that token drops significantly, the value of your rewards in fiat terms will be a lot less than what you might have anticipated. The lock-up periods are crucial too. If the value of the token drops, you won’t be able to cash out until the minimum number of days expires, so you’ll just have to accept whatever losses are incurred (or hope the price rebounds). Perhaps the biggest risk is slashing. Some PoS blockchains implement a slashing mechanism to punish validators who act dishonestly or make mistakes. If the validator you choose is slashed, then some or all of the tokens you have staked could be taken away as a punishment for those indiscretions. In this way, staking can be considered as a “carrot and stick” approach to incentivizing the security of the blockchain. The rewards are the carrot, and slashing is the stick. Should I Stake Crypto? If you’re looking for a way to earn money with crypto, staking with Venga is about as easy as it gets. So long as you can afford to buy some crypto and click a few buttons, you can get started in staking and supporting your favorite networks. While there are other opportunities in the confusing world of DeFi, activities such as yield farming and liquidity provisioning can be extremely complex, requiring a significant degree of technical know-how and the ability to navigate dApps and perform cross-chain swaps and all the rest. In contrast, Venga makes staking so simple that even your grandma could do it with no fuss. Crypto staking can be a very profitable endeavor, and most crypto enthusiasts agree that it’s far better to stake than just sit and “hodl” your tokens and do nothing with them. Blockchain networks offer far greater returns than traditional savings accounts, and while cryptocurrencies can be volatile, sometimes this works in your favor if the price shoots up – suddenly, the value of your rewards might increase immensely. So long as you’re not averse to a little risk, staking via Venga can be a fantastic way to generate a passive income. What’s more, it’s reassuring to know that you’re playing a crucial role in supporting the network, helping to fuel global adoption of blockchain and ensure that crypto will ultimately flourish.

BitLemons ($BLEM) has quietly built a revenue-generating crypto casino platform while Chainlink (LINK) sees massive whale accumulation and Litecoin (LTC) struggles to break critical resistance levels. With BitLemons’ presale gaining explosive momentum after Stage 1 sold out in just 16 days, investors are increasingly questioning whether traditional cryptocurrencies can match the potential returns of this GambleFi innovator. Is Revenue-Backed Growth The Key To Surviving Crypto Volatility? BitLemons stands at the forefront of a potential industry transformation, targeting the massive $450B traditional casino market with a comprehensive platform featuring over 8,000 games from industry giants like Evolution and Pragmatic. This isn’t just another speculative token – it’s a fully operational crypto casino generating actual revenue 24/7. The project’s presale is telling a compelling story of investor confidence. Currently in Stage 2, BitLemons has already raised $1,624,099.56, with 49.07% of the stage completed. The token is priced at $0.02, with 16,040,713 BLEM tokens already sold and 16,651,595 BLEM remaining. Investors have just 13 days, 16 hours, 53 minutes, and 29 seconds before the next price increase, adding a sense of urgency to the investment opportunity. Dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof underscore the project’s commitment to safety. Its tokenomics model allocates 30% of Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) directly to token holders—15 % for strategic buyback and burn and 15% for staking rewards. With projections suggesting a listing price between $0.17 and $0.18, early participants are positioning themselves for potentially significant returns. Are Chainlink Whales Signaling The Next Major Price Movement? Chainlink has surged 7.18% in the past 24 hours to $14.80, with trading volume reaching $811.93M, driven by a dramatic 1,219% increase in whale transactions. These large-scale investors appear to be accumulating aggressively, pushing LINK through previous resistance. Solid support is now established at $13.86 while it challenges the $15.00 psychological barrier. The price chart shows a decisive shift from bearish to bullish momentum with 87% of community sentiment supporting further upside. With substantial volume confirming buyer interest, technical analysts project targets at $16.50 and $18.20 if LINK breaks above $15.00 – positioning it as a high-potential asset, though still lacking the revenue-generating foundation that makes BitLemons uniquely compelling. Will Litecoin’s Exchange Expansion Overcome Bearish Technical Signals? Despite $1.53B in 24-hour volume, Litecoin is trading at $103.58, with a slight 0.91% decrease. Its recent inclusion in Crypto.com’s UpDown Options platform expands its derivatives accessibility. However, LTC faces technical challenges after recovering from a drop to $96. It is now battling to maintain support near $103 while struggling against stubborn resistance at $104.33. The price chart shows lower highs and decreasing volume, indicating trader indecision. Despite these bearish signals, community sentiment remains surprisingly bullish at 84% – a disconnect between emotional positioning and technical reality that investors should weigh carefully when comparing LTC’s uncertain trajectory to BitLemons’ clear revenue-generating advantage. Why BitLemons Could Be Your Definitive Crypto Investment BitLemons emerges as a beacon of innovation as traditional cryptocurrencies navigate uncertain waters. With its revenue-generating casino platform, transparent tokenomics, and a presale capturing investor imagination, BLEM offers more than just speculation – it provides a stake in a real, functioning business. The countdown is on. With just days remaining in the current presale stage and price set to increase, the question isn’t whether to invest in BitLemons, but how quickly you can secure your position in this groundbreaking GambleFi revolution.

Table of Contents Codename:Pepe: The AI operative that means business Turbo eyes resistance amid price fluctuations AI16Z nears support after steep decline Conclusion As the crypto market surges with enthusiasm, a new contender emerges, blending artificial intelligence with viral internet culture. This intriguing development promises to transform the memecoin landscape. The coin, inspired by its predecessors, aims to bring genuine intelligence and profitability to the table. Names like TURBO and AI16Z set precedents for this venture, and its unique approach captures attention. Codename:Pepe crypto steps into the spotlight, aiming to set itself apart from imitation AI coins. This community-driven project not only relies on collective backing but also prides itself on exclusive, AI-powered insights and automated trading prowess. Designed to outshine and outsmart, it beckons the crypto community to witness a new era of memecoin brilliance. Codename:Pepe: The AI operative that means business The crypto underworld is crawling with fake AI projects and empty promises wrapped in buzzwords. Projects, such as Codename:Pepe, aim to end this trend. Codename:Pepe isn’t another overhyped “next-gen intelligence” gimmick. It’s the ultimate undercover agent designed to outmaneuver the memecoin jungle and maximize gains. Its mission is to expose fake AI and embrace real profits. Codename:Pepe is a stealth-mode successor to the legendary PEPE coin, which skyrocketed nearly 22,000%. This new agent shares the same ambition, but its success depends on the operatives, the users. Unlike VC-backed rug pulls, Codename:Pepe is fueled by the people. The stronger the support, the higher it moonwalks. That’s why it’s launching with a community-driven presale featuring a strategic entry plan: Stage one entry price: $0.003333333 Final presale price: $0.151515152 Early-bird discount: 98% This isn’t just another memecoin. Codename:Pepe deploys AI-powered intelligence to scan the market, predict trends, and hunt down the next moonshot before the FOMO frenzy begins. AI trading signals: Real insights, not hype Automated AI-trader: Turns signals into real trades for users Exclusive DAO access: Hold AGNT to unlock classified strategies, insider analytics, and voting rights on high-stakes missions The perks of holding AGNT: Membership in an elite, AI-driven DAO Early access to exclusive trading intel Passive rewards through staking profits This is a community-first operation, meaning the tokenomics actually benefit investors: Total supply: 5 billion (no surprise inflation bombs) Staking and rewards: 25% allocated to loyal operatives Presale allocation: 20% (discounted supply is limited) The mission is live. The presale is now open. You might also like: Dogecoin plunges 40% as market sell-off intensifies, Codename:Pepe and SHIB hold strong Turbo eyes resistance amid price fluctuations Turbo (TURBO) is currently trading between $0.003117 and $0.003986. The coin has shown volatility in recent sessions. Traders are keen to see if it can break through the nearest resistance level at $0.004284. If Turbo surpasses the $0.004284 resistance, it could signal a bullish trend. This move would represent a potential gain of about 7.5% from the current upper price. Such an increase might attract more investors and boost market confidence. On the other hand, the nearest support level is at $0.002545. A drop to this level would mean a decline of approximately 18% from the current lower price. This could indicate bearish sentiment and caution among traders. The market sentiment appears cautious, with the coin hovering near key levels. The potential for growth exists if buying pressure increases and Turbo breaks resistance. However, failure to do so might lead to a pullback toward support. AI16Z nears support after steep decline AI16Z has experienced a significant decline in recent weeks. The coin’s price dropped about 20% in the last week and nearly 37% over the past month. Currently, it trades between $0.32 and $0.51. The nearest support level is at $0.20. If the price reaches this level, it could stabilize and potentially bounce back. On the other hand, the nearest resistance is at $0.57. Overcoming this hurdle might indicate a shift towards an upward trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for AI16Z stands at 42.74. This number suggests the coin is approaching oversold territory. While not yet at extreme levels, an RSI below 30 often signals that a reversal may be on the horizon as buyers return. Despite the recent downturn, AI16Z has recorded a gain of about 24% over the past six months. This longer-term growth indicates potential for recovery. If the coin holds above the support level and gains upward momentum, it could move toward the resistance at $0.57, potentially achieving notable percentage gains from current prices. Conclusion In the current crypto surge, Codename:Pepe crypto emerges as a standout opportunity. While coins like TURBO and AI16Z show potential, they may offer less in the short term compared to this new project. Codename:Pepe crypto combines real artificial intelligence with the memecoin trend to maximize profits through smart trading and community-driven efforts. By harnessing AI to analyze market trends and automate trades, Codename:Pepe crypto provides a practical tool for investors navigating the memecoin market. Its limited token supply and focus on community involvement set it apart from other projects. To learn more about Codename:Pepe crypto here, visit the website, Telegram , and Twitter.

The AI bot on X was asked to produce a coin name, and came up with Grok Coin (GrokCoin), which was promptly minted on Solana. Just hours after launching an unofficial Grok Coin (GrokCoin), proposed by the AI agent on X, smart money wallets were already buying the new asset. The inflow of funds is relatively low for a meme token, as investors are more cautious and there is no mass retail entry. Alphanomics noted that smart whales are already picking up the token, awaiting an eventual breakout. The market remains highly skeptical, as meme assets are often used to drain the liquidity pool after enough buyers show up.

The token’s fame reimagines the creation of FARTCOIN, which was also named by the Truth Terminal AI model. Nansen researchers also noted that GrokCoin is inviting retail buyers, while smart money watches on the sides and makes cautious moves. GrokCoin was the ticker with the highest liquidity and the fewest signs of early sniping and aggressive selling. | Source: DexScreener. GrokCoin, currently is the most active version of the meme token, with a valuation of $24.5M, and $945K in its liquidity pool. The original GrokCoin is relatively well-distributed, and has not been dumped for profit. The top trader took a profit of $330K, much smaller compared to other rug-pulled tokens. Based on Bubblemaps, GrokCoin is distributed among diverse wallets, with still only a few connected clusters. The token does not show immediate signs of being sniped or held by insiders. For that reason, the GrokCoin ticker also has the healthiest chart and highest liquidity. A few hours after its launch, GrokCoin rose to $0.022, surpassing other copycat tokens and arising as the most promising version. Several risky copycat tickers confuse traders One of the most active copycat coins was the ticker GROKCOIN. Despite the doubts, early whales pumped $1M into the token, which immediately started actively trading. Grok was also quickly sold, leaving just $368K in its main liquidity pool. GROKCOIN already went through its first rug pull, a crash from $0.09 back down to $0.009, erasing 90% of its value. GROKCOIN is trading at $0.00011, after having a small 10X rally. In the early hours since its launch, The token did not manage to break above a penny. It does not have a marketing campaign or any organized promotion by influencers, relying only on the growing usage of the Grok AI model. What is even more confusing, there are multiple Grok copies or tokens previously created to reflect the model’s success. One of the recently launched variants, known simply as Grok, traded at $0.00011, with liquidity of just $47,000. The copycat meme is gaining some traction, though nowhere near the original GROKCOIN. Insiders took early profits on GROKCOIN GrokCoin showed that social media memes can still be turned into tokens and cause at least some inflows of liquidity. However, GROKCOIN came with a warning for being launched by a team known to rug pull or at least aggressively extract liquidity from tokens. Hours after the launch, the top GROKCOIN trader had already realized $1.9M in earnings, essentially draining the liquidity pool. The second-best trader locked in $772K, with other sellers locking in over $400K within hours. As with other meme tokens, GROKCOIN looks like being sniped early and held in insider wallets. The top wallet controls over 17% of the asset’s supply. As a coincidence, it is precisely this wallet that dumped and realized the highest profits extremely early in the history of the token. The copycat GROKCOIN ticker was held by one leading address. That same address realized gains of $1.9M, while the token crashed by 90%. | Source: Bubblemaps The remaining supply of GROKCOIN is split into smaller wallets, holding exactly 0.55% or 0.50% of the token’s supply. Those similar wallets may also be used to dump on new buyers. After the initial rug pull, GROKCOIN continued with more trading in the green, though there is still a large portion of the supply that can be dumped on retail owners. GROKCOIN follows a long trend of fake launches, especially for coins linked to Elon Musk, X, or any other related products or companies. While the asset really exists, it follows the rules of risky new launches. GROKCOIN trades on Raydium, and although its liquidity is locked, the main pool fluctuates depending on buying and selling pressure. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

At press time SOL trades at $143 after a 5% decline in 24 hours. Despite this price decline, the Solana network has outperformed Ethereum and other blockchains in fees, but one market expert believes that the blockchain is like a “house of cards.” Solana Price in Focus as Expert Labels Blockchain a “House of Cards” The Solana blockchain has outpaced other networks in terms of fees, amid a surge in activity on the PumpFun meme coin launchpad. Data from TokenTerminal shows that in the last 30 days, the total fees on the Solana blockchain hit $74M, which was notably higher than Ethereum’s $35M. However, according to the founder of The DeFi Report Michael Nadeau, these fees do not indicate high activity on the Solana blockchain. He said, “The Solana growth arc is impressive. But if you look under the hood, it looks like a house of cards.” Nadeau also added that in the last 30 days, 95% of the total fees on Solana came from only 1.26% of wallets. Additionally, most of the fees were from meme coins being traded on the blockchain amid heightened activity around the PumpFun meme coin launchpad, which helped to boost Solana price. Despite the criticism, Wall Street giant Franklin Templeton believes that Solana is rivaling Ethereum in DeFi dominance. The asset manager also noted that Solana’s one-year uptime record was boosting adoption, which may bode well for the Solana price. Solana Technical Analysis Solana’s outlook on its daily chart shows a significant surge in selling activity and a lack of fresh demand from retail traders. The RSI has flattened below 50, showing that a bearish momentum is in place, and buyers are not buying the recent dip. The bull-bear power indicator also shows a similar outlook, with the negative histogram bars suggesting that selling activity is higher than buying activity. If sellers remain in control, it could see Solana price losing its make-or-break support level at $142. If Solana fails to defend this support as whales continue to sell SOL , it could prompt a notable decline to the $110 level. On the other hand, if the Solana price bounces from this support level, it could push the price up towards the $179 resistance level. This could pave the way for a recovery past $200. SOL/USD: 1-day Chart This technical outlook shows a bearish Solana price prediction . However, as the network activity rises, it could bode well for the altcoin’s future price outlook.

As Ripple continues its battle for dominance, another DeFi contender, Remittix(RTX) is emerging with the potential to shake up the market. Cardano, known for its strong community and blockchain efficiency, is also facing increasing competition from this rising star. Remittix is a DeFi token that is making waves in the crypto-to-fiat payments sector. With analysts predicting a major shake-up before 2026, RTX is quickly positioning itself as a real challenger to both XRP and ADA. It has raked in $13.5 million in funding and sold over 515 million tokens. Dark Defender Forecasts XRP Price To Reach New Peak While the crypto community awaits the approval of a Ripple ETF, the XRP price has remained above $2 in the past week. The altcoin had witnessed a mass uptick to $2.94 on Sunday before dropping to lower levels. Currently, data from CoinMarketCap shows the XRP price has been consolidating between $2.2 and 2.6 in the past few days. The XRP price has risen by 16% in the weekly timeframe, outshining other altcoins in the market. Going forward, Zack Ractor forecasts the XRP price could surge to $10 this year. Another analyst called Dark Defender says the XRP price has broken the 4-hour resistance while the RSI has formed a Golden Cross. XRP price prediction shared by Dark Defender Based on these bullish signs, the analyst forecasts the XRP price could rise to a new all-time high. However, Dark Defender notes the XRP price faces resistance around the $3.3999 which must be broken to hit $4. Cardano (ADA) Skyrockets On Weekly Timeframe The current Cardano price chart shows that the DeFi coin is in the green zone. It is among one of the top altcoins rallying in the market right now. Data from CoinMarketCap shows the Cardano price has risen by 41.0% on the weekly timeframe. The Cardano price is also bullish on the higher timeframes – 21.1% on the weekly chart and 31.2% on the monthly level. In terms of future price targets, AltCryptoGems says the Cardano price might rally to $1.70 in the next few weeks. Cardano price prediction shared by AltCryptoGems The analyst argued that the inclusion of Cardano in the US Strategic Crypto Reserve could lead to an upsurge which could push the Cardano price into the green zone. He also noted that the White House Crypto Summit could bring positive sentiment to the market. In the meantime, the sentiment surrounding the Cardano price is bullish. The relative strength index is above the midline which means that bulls are in charge. Also, the Awesome Oscillator (5, 34) and VWMA (10) are in the buy region, signaling high bullish activity. Remittix (RTX) Pumps By Over 250%, Attracts Investors With Unique Utility While the XRP price is at a peak, Remittix (RTX) has increased its gains to 250%. Currently, in the presale phase, the DeFi coin is priced at $0.0694, and it could easily increase by 10x in the next few months. Remittix is one of the new DeFi projects that integrate cryptocurrencies with fiat systems to redefine cross-border payments. Thus, Remittix can exchange over 50 cryptocurrencies for fiat money and transfer the funds to any bank account in the world. This also assists the recipients to receive their payments in Fiat money of their choice without ever coming across cryptocurrencies, thus making it easier to use. One of the key features of Remittix is its PayFi environment that integrates cryptocurrencies with conventional finance systems. It is user-friendly and allows for direct crypto-to-fiat trade, which makes cross-border transactions quite manageable. For example, Remittix has a clear and definite price list, which does not include hidden fees that are present in most banking services. For businesses, Remittix has a Pay API that enables the acceptance of cryptocurrency payments and the conversion of fiat to the desired bank accounts. This feature gives the merchants freedom and control over their financial transactions, over 30 fiat currency pairs and over 50 crypto pairs. Can Remittix Outshine These Top DeFi Projects? With XRP and ADA maintaining their stronghold, any new competitor must bring something revolutionary to the table—and Remittix is doing just that. By offering seamless crypto-to-fiat transactions for businesses and individuals, RTX is carving out a niche that could see it rival the biggest names in the DeFi market. Investors looking for the best crypto to buy can check out Remittix.

While positive news is expected from this summit, the US Treasury Secretary made important statements before the summit. Speaking to CNBC, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the US should be a leader in Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto and should lead the world. Bessent also said that the US should first stop selling Bitcoin and then bring Bitcoin to the country. Bessent, who also signaled new Bitcoin purchases, said, “The first thing to do is to stop the government's Bitcoin sales. Time will tell how new BTC purchases will be.” The US Treasury Secretary also spoke about customs tariffs, one of the most talked about topics in recent days. “With his latest moves, Trump has begun the process of reorienting our international economic relations through tariff policies. Trump wants to trade fairly with China, but we still have a long way to go. China needs to rebalance.” *This is not investment advice.

The crypto market is still trapped in a deep bearish phase, with many crypto tokens continuing their steep decline. DOGE, which many investors had hoped would have a strong start in 2025, has not escaped this downturn. In the past thirty days, DOGE has dropped by a staggering 30%. This sharp decline appears to be linked to Donald Trump’s firm stance on maintaining U.S. tariffs against countries like Mexico and Canada . In February, similar macroeconomic concerns triggered a widespread crypto crash, and DOGE was no exception. With the U.S. President showing no signs of backing down, it looks like there may be more struggles ahead for the DOGE price. Additionally, many investors have been concerned about DOGE’s rising trading volume , which, combined with the decline in DOGE price charts, is a sign of heavy selling pressure. For now, DOGE token holders face a tough road ahead. The market remains fragile, and without a change in sentiment or policy, DOGE might not find relief anytime soon. Unless buyers step in to absorb the selling pressure, DOGE’s fall could worsen and push prices even lower. Source: Santiment . Conclusion While DOGE is struggling to show growth amid the recent market crash, Rollblock is capturing the attention of both gamers and investors, making it hard to ignore. Its robust ecosystem and an impressive RBLK presale have contributed to this rising interest, with $11 million generated so far. With the public presale still live, investors who jump in now could see jaw-dropping returns by purchasing RBLK at $0.06! Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Nvidia stock is down by 5.7% today , putting Nvidia shares down nearly 18% year-to-date, which marks the worst monthly performance for Nvidia since June 22, according to Yahoo! Finance . Source: Trading View Nvidia recently published its Q4 earnings for 2024 ending Jan. 26, reporting year-over-year revenue growth of 78% at $39.33 billion for the quarter, beating analyst estimates of $38.25 billion. However, even though Nvidia’s earnings exceeded analyst’s forecasts, the potential impact of DeepSeek concerned investors, who worried that it may reduce the demand for Nvidia’s chips in the future. However, Nvidia stated that DeepSeek increased the demand for its inferencing solutions, leaving investors puzzled as to what may be causing the recent tumble. Another concern was Nvidia’s profit margins, which were a bit lower than expected. According to Nvidia, this is mainly because they’re investing heavily in making their new Blackwell GPUs. Nvidia expects profit margins to recover by the second half of the year. Source: Nvidia Newsroom You might also like: Bitcoin price, Nasdaq 100 index falls ahead of NVIDIA earnings One key factor which might have sent Nvidia stock tumbling is the risk of tariffs being placed on Taiwan , where Nvidia manufactures its AI chips. If these tariffs are imposed, it could make Nvidia’s products more expensive to produce and sell, impacting its profitability. There’s also uncertainty about whether the U.S. will impose additional restrictions or expand the current ones. If this happens, it could limit Nvidia’s ability to sell its chips to Chinese customers, affecting its growth potential, especially given how significant China is in the global semiconductor market. Jim Cramer even sarcastically commented on X “Clownshow buyers of Nvidia, it went negative… now ok,” pointing to the market’s erratic reaction to Nvidia’s stock amid all the uncertainty. Clownshow buyers of nvidia, it went negative… now ok — Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) March 5, 2025 Following in Nvidia’s and other AI stocks’ footsteps, the AI & Big Data tokens’ market cap has declined by almost 5% in the last 24 hours and by 9% over the last month. This suggests that as AI stocks take a hit, it looks like investors are pulling back from AI cryptos, fearing that a slowdown in AI hardware development could stunt growth in decentralized AI projects that rely on it (like Nvidia GPUs). Source: Coinmarketcap Story Protocol ( IP ) and Render ( RENDER ) have been hit especially hard, declining by 9% and 4% respectively in the past 24 hours. Both Story Protocol and Render likely rely on Nvidia’s or other similar high-performance GPUs for processing visual data, simulations, and other AI-driven functionalities. Near Protocol ( NEAR ) and Virtuals Protocol ( VIRTUAL ), which support GPU-heavy applications built on top of their platforms, were hit even harder, declining by 6% and 12% respectively. All told, what happens to Nvidia can feel like a tsunami, when a sell off wave mounts, the entire market takes notice, including crypto. With the behemoth outpacing earnings last quarter, it seems global uncertainty is fuelling the recent sell-off, with several AI tangential cryptocurrencies felling the pinch as well.

The move has sparked fears of a potential correction. As a result, investors are scrambling for alternatives and seeking safer, more promising assets. Many investors are looking elsewhere to hedge their portfolios against further volatility with coins like Remittix (RTX) . This is a fast-rising altcoin that is redefining the crypto-to-fiat payments space. With over 16k holders and $13.4 million raised in its ongoing presale, RTX could be a good crypto to buy. $450M SOL Sent To Binance, Solana Price To Drop? After a recent uptick to $178 on March 3, the Solana price has dropped to the $140-$150 range. CoinMarketCap data indicates the Solana price has dipped by 14.1% on the biweekly chart. However, it is up 6.4% on the weekly chart, making it one of the top gainers. Solana price chart showing resurgence: TradingView Meanwhile, the recent Solana price correction comes after reports from MerlijnTrader revealed that FTX and Alameda have sent about 430 million to Binance. This move could tank the Solana price if they should sell. In addition to the 450 million transfer, the ongoing tariff war between the US and China, Mexico, and Canada has affected investors' sentiment. Many fear the many top crypto coins could see more declines in the coming days. However, the US Crypto Summit meeting on Friday has brought some positive sentiment to the market. Analysts expect the Trump administration to relax tariffs against Mexico and Canada, a stance that could benefit the crypto market. In the meantime, technical indicators like the Keltner Channel suggest the Solana price is still bearish with the middle line at $161.88 as a resistance level. A move above this level could lead to a further upward movement to the upper channel at $198.29. On the flip side, a long consolidation or downtrend could occur if the Solana price doesn’t clear this resistance level. Remittix (RTX) Predicted To Rise 20x, Attracts SOL Investors While uncertainty clouds the Solana price trajectory, Remittix (RTX) is gaining attention from investors. It is a leading player in the cross-border payments sector, and it has made great strides in its cryptocurrency ICO. The platform has been able to secure over $13.4 million in funding and is priced at $0.0694. Its price is expected to rise by 20x this year, making it one of the top altcoins to watch. The RTX coin is the core of Remittix’s economy which is used for staking, voting, and rewards. The token has a maximum supply of 1.5 billion to ensure that the token becomes scarce and could increase in value as more people adopt the platform. The platform offers the PayFi system that allows users to convert more than 40 cryptocurrencies to fiat money and make direct transfers to bank accounts. This is especially helpful for individuals who engage in cross-border transactions, as it provides a convenient and hassle-free way of making transactions for both personal and business purposes. For businesses, Remittix has the Remittix Pay API enabling organizations to accept cryptocurrency payments with cash out in fiat. This feature expands the payment possibilities without forcing businesses to deal with cryptocurrencies, which increases their customer base and improves their financial freedom. Furthermore, Remittix also takes security and privacy seriously. Funds are received by the recipient's bank accounts as regular bank transfers, thus, no links to cryptocurrencies are visible. It has been especially appreciated by users who are interested in implementing blockchain technology in their business while keeping their operations private. Solana Investors Jump To This New DeFi Coin The massive SOL transfer by FTX and Alameda has shaken the confidence of many investors, forcing them to rethink their strategies. While Solana remains a dominant force in the DeFi space, the uncertainty surrounding these transactions has led to a surge of interest in promising altcoins like Remittix. As its presale continues to gain momentum, those who position themselves early could be looking at exponential gains once it hits major exchanges in 2025.

Critics argue that the reserve’s initial funding through seized Bitcoins doesn’t constitute a meaningful commitment to the cryptocurrency. However, Bitcoin maxi Samson Mow explains how the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has the potential to revolutionize the cryptocurrency landscape. Bitcoin News: How BTC Reserve Could Revolutionize the Crypto Space? Amidst discussions surrounding the potential implications of a strategic BTC reserve, Bitcoin maxi Samson Mow shared his insights. In an X post , Mow highlighted the significance of a Bitcoin reserve. Despite initial rumors suggesting no Bitcoin purchases would be made, Mow assured that buying will indeed occur, albeit through “budget-neutral” strategies. These strategies include issuing Bitcoin Bonds or selling gold reserves to acquire Bitcoin. Mow expressed confidence in Howard Lutnick’s ability to execute these plans, stating, “Give it some time. Howard Lutnick will get it done.” Potential Implications of Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Notably, the establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve represents a watershed moment in Bitcoin’s history, elevating it to the same level as gold. With the stroke of a pen, President Trump has made Bitcoin a game-changer, cementing its status as a strategic asset. He wrote, Today, with the stroke of a pen, POTUS has equivocated Bitcoin with gold. The SBR is a digital Fort Knox. Let that sink in. The real race for nation-state Bitcoin adoption really begins. In addition, the SBR could bring transparency to the US government’s Bitcoin holdings. As per current estimations, the United States hold around 112,000 BTC or less. Out of this, 95,000 BTC belongs to Bitfinex, putting China in the lead with 194,000 BTC. However, with Bitcoin becoming a reserve, the US is likely to conduct an audit and increase its holdings to maintain its competitive edge. Mow’s post comes following Farcaster founder Dan Romero’s statement that the US has no plans to buy Bitcoin. Instead, he stated that the government will capitalize the seized assets. Increased BTC Adoption and Growth Ahead Significantly, the SBR could push Bitcoin’s price to remarkable heights as noted by Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the popular book, “Rich Dad Poor Dad.” According to Kiyosaki , Bitcoin could help America resolve its financial crises. With Bitcoin’s increased acceptance and adoption, the US envisions becoming a global lead in the crypto industry. Thus, America views positioning itself as a leader in the global economy and setting the stage for a new era of competition and innovation.

While the aforementioned crypto reserve could spark some positive movement down the line, judging by the current Solana price levels, many are doubting this. However, one AI crypto has the best projected growth potential and could rise up to several times. Read on to find out where these predictions come from and what is next for the Solana price. Solana Price Analysis: Where Will It Go In Q2 2025 Solana has built a reputation as one of the fastest blockchains in the industry, attracting a strong developer community and large-scale institutional backing. The SOL price has had an impressive history, reaching an all-time high of $294.33 on January 19, 2025. However, the token has struggled to maintain its momentum, with a significant price correction bringing it down to $142.02 by March 3, 2025, following the hype increase after the strategic reserve announcement. SOL has encountered several challenges, including security concerns and increased competition from new blockchain technologies. The market’s growing interest in AI-powered and more adaptable blockchain solutions puts pressure on SOL to maintain its innovation edge. While it remains one of the top cryptocurrencies, some experts believe Solana’s price movement ability to generate explosive returns is becoming limited as its market matures, and are pointing to this AI crypto as their best bet for Q2 2025. Why IntelMarkets (INTL) Has More Upside Than Solana As blockchain technology evolves, AI is becoming a key component in the next wave of decentralized applications. AI-powered altcoins are gaining momentum due to their ability to automate trading, improve market analytics, and optimize liquidity. IntelMarkets (INTL) stands out as a leader in this sector, offering an AI-powered trading platform that integrates DeFi with machine learning. Choosing IntelMarkets over Solana makes strategic sense because of its superior growth potential. The large market capitalization status of Solana restricts its capacity to deliver exponential growth to investors. INTL is still at an early phase which allows the project to achieve substantial future expansion. The IntelMarkets presale initiative achieved great success by raising more than $11.2 million in funding during an exceptionally brief time. IntelMarkets is priced at just $0.09 in its latest presale stage, giving early investors a low-cost entry into what could be the next major AI-powered crypto project. Experts indicate that INTL has the potential to surge by 45 times after its launch as one of the most profitable assets in 2025. Compared to Solana’s projected gains, which are expected to be modest due to its already high valuation, IntelMarkets provides a much stronger risk-reward ratio. Beyond its financial potential, INTL is also solving real-world problems in crypto trading. By leveraging AI to enhance decision-making, reduce risks, and execute high-speed transactions, the platform is set to revolutionize how traders interact with digital assets. This level of innovation is unmatched by Solana and positions IntelMarkets as a true contender for the next big AI-driven rally. Conclusion Solana’s best days of explosive growth may be behind it. While it remains a solid blockchain with strong fundamentals, its upside is becoming more limited as newer technologies and narratives take over. AI-driven cryptos like IntelMarkets (INTL) are emerging as the most exciting opportunities in the market, offering a unique blend of innovation, utility, and massive growth potential, making it the best bet for Q2 2025.

In my view, the market is significantly undervaluing its BTC mining business. With a “HODL” strategy and $28,801/BTC electricity costs (vs. $89,000 average), MARA offers high upside in case of a Bitcoin’s bull market, but with bear market risks. I value MARA’s mining business, projecting 64,000 Bitcoins by 2048, at $5.7 billion–$11 billion, far above the $800 million implied by its market cap. Dilution and volatility are risks, but I rate MARA a STRONG BUY for Bitcoin-bullish, risk-tolerant investors aiming to beat BTC. Bitcoin skeptics should avoid the stock. I purchased most of my Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) holdings in 2022, during the bear market. Back then, I also timidly started a position in Strategy ( MSTR ), which at the time was trading below the value of its Bitcoin holdings, at a NAV discount. Even after accounting for the current correction, I enjoyed triple-digit returns on my Bitcoin investment, and significantly more on my MSTR trade (which I ended up converting to Bitcoin in November last year). However, had I put all my money in Strategy instead of Bitcoin back in 2022, I would have been able to retire. That’s because in such a highly volatile market such as that of Bitcoin, opportunities are amplified and leveraged bets can provide incredible upside. That, of course, is also valid on the contrary - leveraged bets can be incredibly dangerous for investors if they are entered at the wrong time and should be weighed carefully. I believe the current Bitcoin correction is presenting a “golden opportunity” with Bitcoin Miners, and especially with MARA Holdings, Inc. ( MARA ) . Since August, MARA’s market capitalization has slightly decreased, while Bitcoin’s has been on a bull run. In this article, I will analyze Marathon’s last earnings and outline why I believe it represents a deep value proposition following a significant compression of its market valuation. Marathon Holdings: Why I see Deep Value Here The investment thesis for Marathon Holdings is simple, yet powerful: the company trades at $4.7 Billion in market cap , holding roughly $3.9 Billion worth of Bitcoin at the time of writing. I believe the ~18% premium on its BTC holdings is more than justified by its Bitcoin mining business, which I deem worth between $5.7 Billion and $11 Billion in itself. Let’s dive into the numbers. EH/s by Miner (Marathon Holdings Q4 report) The current average cost of mining a Bitcoin is about $89,000 (this figure only includes electricity). However, MARA, as the largest publicly listed Bitcoin miner, is far more efficient than the “average” Bitcoin miner , as shown by the image above displaying its EH/s (exahashes per second), a measure of computational power used in Bitcoin mining to solve complex mathematical problems and secure the BTC network. Understanding just how much MARA “pays” to mine 1 Bitcoin is not a totally straightforward task, as it depends on what is allocated. Below is my assessment for 2024: MARA reported they incurred $28,801 of electricity cost to mine one Bitcoin in 2024. This is less than one third the average cost on the network of $89,000. When accounting for mining costs (from its 10K ), at $381 Million, MARA’s cost for mining one Bitcoin grows to $ 40,471 per coin . Considering all costs of revenue (which includes depreciation, amortization and hosting services), at $815 Million, MARA’s costs for mining one Bitcoin grows to $ 86,489 per coin . The above figures are based on the reported 9,430 Bitcoins MARA mined in 2024. Since 2024 was a year of halving for Bitcoin, these metrics are positively skewed by higher BTC rewards that MARA enjoyed until April (after each halving, Bitcoin rewards decrease). Focusing on Q4 numbers , well after the halving and with 4,492 Bitcoins mined, MARA registered the following metrics: Mining costs of $130 Million, resulting in a cost for extracting one Bitcoin of $ 52,156. Total cost of revenue of $267 Million, resulting in a cost for extracting one Bitcoin of $ 107,209 . It’s worth noting that quarterly mining results for companies like Marathon may not fully predict future performance, as they can be influenced by operational factors and hash rate variance. Bitcoin mining rewards are fixed — currently 3.125 BTC per block, plus transaction fees — but the frequency of block discovery depends on a miner’s computational power relative to network difficulty, which can fluctuate. This variability, often called “luck” in mining circles, means quarterly numbers can be noisy, so investors should look at longer-term trends to gauge a miner’s potential. On top of cost of revenue, MARA also reported R&D and SG&A expenses for roughly $84 Million in Q4 2024. Were MARA to only rely on selling the Bitcoin it mines to sustain its business, that would make it profitable with Bitcoin at ~ $140,000 per coin (based on Q4 data, with 2492 Bitcoins mined and a total cost of $357 Million). While that may seem problematic, I believe it actually isn’t. I am going to explain the reason why in the next paragraphs. MARA’s profits are a function of Bitcoin appreciating; and that’s a good thing MARA's Income Statement, Q4 (Marathon Holdings Q4 Report) With Bitcoin experiencing a sustained bull run in Q4, MARA reported a strong quarter, with more than $ 500 Million in Net Income. Most of this Net Income came from Bitcoin’s appreciation , rather than from mining operations. This is what emerges when looking at MARA’s reported income statement (above), as the vast majority of Operating Income was generated by changes in the “fair value of digital assets”. Indeed, Bitcoin in Q4 was only briefly priced at more than the $107,000 cost MARA incurred to mine Bitcoin when accounting for mining cost and depreciation. It was never at the roughly $140,000 price MARA would need to be profitable if it sold all the Bitcoin it mined, immediately. Q4 Figures at a glance, MARA (Marathon Holdings Q4 Report) However, MARA does not rely on the Bitcoin it mines to finance its operations. On the contrary, the company has adopted a “HODL” strategy similar to that of Michael Saylor’s Strategy. That’s why MARA started reporting BTC Yield per Share in its quarterly financials, as shown by the image above. This figure represents the growth in how much BTC a shareholder is theoretically “entitled” to by holding MARA. I believe the company is trying to shift the attention from financial metrics expressed in Fiat currency to Bitcoin metrics, similar to Strategy. I do not see this as an issue. MARA, as a Bitcoin miner, is a leveraged bet on Bitcoin. Readers that are bearish on Bitcoin should not even consider buying MARA. If Bitcoin were to experience a prolonged correction and fail to position itself as a global reserve asset, MARA would suffer and eventually go bankrupt. The bullish case for MARA is inevitably tied to a bullish case for Bitcoin. Personally, I see Bitcoin as an asymmetric bet with an expected payout between $112,500 and $200,000 - something I covered in a very recent article. In that context, MARA is a leveraged bet that comes at a great discount, as its entire mining operation is only valued at ~ $800 Million at the time of writing. In the next section, I will discuss my valuation for MARA’s Bitcoin mining business. I value MARA’s mining business between $5.7 and $11 Billion. In my view, the valuation of MARA’s mining business is dependent on the value of all the Bitcoins MARA will generate until 2140, the last year a Bitcoin will ever be mined. For simplicity, I am excluding the revenue that MARA will be able to generate from other Bitcoin transactions by acting like a node. I am also ""limiting"" my projections to the next 5 halvings, and excluding any income generated by mining other cryptocurrencies. In my first article about Marathon Holdings, I calculated how many Bitcoins I would expect MARA to produce. Readers can read that article, should they be interested in knowing the assumptions behind my calculations. Below is the summary of my calculations: I expect MARA to produce ~27,000 Bitcoins until the 2028 halving (20 BTC per day, multiplied by 1349 days until mid-April 2028). I then expect the company to produce ~16,000, ~9700, ~ 5700, ~3500, and ~2100 Bitcoins for the following five halvings ( ending in 2048 ). The total [is] 64,000 Bitcoins. At current market prices, 64,000 Bitcoins are worth $5.7 Billion . Given my Bitcoin valuation model has an expected value between $112,500 and $200,000 per coin, I would assign the value of these Bitcoins at between $7.2 Billion and $12.8 Billion. Should Bitcoin mature into a global reserve asset, matching gold’s market capitalization at roughly $750,000 per coin , these Bitcoins would be worth $48 Billion. Of course, these figures are relative to the current and projected market value of Bitcoin to be mined by MARA, and they do not represent the profit MARA will be able to make after mining Bitcoin. Projecting an exact profit margin is challenging, in my view, considering how rewards are expected to decrease for every Bitcoin halving, and many other variables are involved. However, considering that today MARA would be able to break even with BTC at $140,000 (as described before), and assuming Bitcoin could reach the upper bound of my expected value ( $200,000) in this cycle, one could estimate a long-term net profit margin of 30% for MARA’s mining operations. This 30% assumed net profit would mean that MARA could pocket ~$11 Billion in net profit , only from new Bitcoin they mine, should Bitcoin’s long-term price reach $750,000 per coin. This figure excludes the possibility that Bitcoin goes beyond $750,000 per coin, or any other revenue stream for MARA. My final valuation for MARA’s business is between $5.7 Billion, the current market value of projected future Bitcoins mined by MARA, and this $11 Billion figure. No matter if readers agree or not with my rough valuation model, I think it’s reasonable to say that paying $800 Million for the entire future mining operations of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miner is a bargain. Risks The main risk with an investment in MARA concerns the fact that it is a leveraged bet on Bitcoin. It is exclusively in the context of a Bitcoin bull market that MARA may, in my opinion, outperform Bitcoin itself . As a leveraged bet, MARA may also underperform Bitcoin significantly in a bear run or in any correction. On a personal note, I have lost money by badly timing MARA and buying Long Call Options back in December last year. This is when I started to notice a wide discrepancy between its valuation and the BTC bull run. This is why today I would rather invest in MARA by simply holding the stock (or, at most, LEAPS), as the implied volatility of any stock correlated with Bitcoin can result in significant losses for investors. Shares Outstanding, MARA ( companiesmarketcap.com ) Another key risk of a trade in MARA is shareholder dilution . The company has adopted a “HODL” strategy for Bitcoin on its balance sheet. While I see this as a positive development, this also means that MARA has to find other ways to finance itself that go beyond selling Bitcoin, including issuing new shares. Historically, MARA has incurred massive shareholders dilution, as shown by the image above. The company increased stock count by a factor of more than 3X since the end of Q1 2021. Similarly to MSTR, MARA’s management may also opt for issuing new shares to buy Bitcoin in case of a bull run, limiting the potential upside of the company. Regardless of Bitcoin’s price action, the company will need to find ways to finance itself as it has negative cash from operations of roughly $300 Million as of Q4 (Seeking Alpha data). With slightly less than $400 Million in cash, MARA may opt to dilute shareholders in the very near future. Ultimately, I believe a trade in MARA should only be considered by investors who are bullish on Bitcoin and are willing to take significantly more risk and volatility than simply buying Bitcoin. Conclusion The first time I covered MARA back in August, the company was valued at roughly $5 Billion and Bitcoin was trading in the $50,000 to $60,000 range. Since then, Bitcoin has reached a new ATH of ~ $109,000, and it has been trading above $80,000 for more than three months. Yet, MARA is now valued at $4.5 Billion. As obvious as it may sound, investors seeking alpha should strive to buy assets when others are fearful and an investment thesis has not fully developed. Yet, I have observed many people in the crypto space doing the exact opposite, entering trades only after an originally risky investment thesis turned out to be a winner. An example concerns Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which was rejected by most investors when it traded below the value of its Bitcoin holdings but suscitated a lot of retail interest once it outperformed Bitcoin. Only investors who bought when others were fearful enjoyed outsized returns. I think Bitcoin’s recent price correction has created an opportunistic trade with Marathon Holdings. The market value of MARA is almost entirely justified by its mere Bitcoin holdings. Investors today can “buy” the entire mining business of this company for roughly $800 Million , while I expect it to be worth between $5.7 and $11 Billion. If you believe in Bitcoin as an asymmetric bet (a big if in itself), I think this is an excellent entry point for MARA. I rate the company a STRONG BUY and I expect it to overperform Bitcoin in case of a bull run . Significant risks exist and this trade should only be considered by those who have a higher appetite for risk, and are not happy with ‘simply’ holding BTC.",BTC-USD|MARA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-07 13:30:00

Currently in Phase 2 of its presale, MUTM tokens are priced at $0.015, with a projected launch price of $0.06, offering investors a potential 300% return on investment. The project has raised more than $2.3 million and attracted over 4300 holders in record time. In contrast, Solana (SOL) and Pepe (PEPE) have experienced significant volatility. SOL’s price recently retreated from $180 to $140 amid FTX’s $431 million token unlock, though technical indicators suggest support at $120 may prevent further decline. Pepe Coin, after surging 1,444.7% in 2024, has tumbled dramatically in 2025, causing financial setbacks and skepticism among investors. Analysts predict that MUTM could surge to $1 in 2025, translating to a 67x return for early investors. This potential, combined with its strong presale performance and the challenges faced by other altcoins, positions Mutuum Finance as a better opportunity for those seeking high-growth investments in the crypto market. Solana and Pepe: a new opportunity ahead Solana (SOL) and Pepe (PEPE) delivered massive gains, but their recent declines highlight the risks of chasing past winners. SOL dropped from $180 to $140 due to FTX’s token unlock, while PEPE, after a 1,444.7% surge, saw a sharp correction. For those who missed out or got caught in the downturn, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a fresh start.

This plunge has coincided with the price action of other meme coins. SHIB, however, is showing signs of a potential rebound after falling to a key support and forming a falling wedge pattern. A potential catalyst will be that Shibarium is about to hit a 1 billion transaction milestone. Shiba Inu Price May Get Boosted by Shibarium Transactions SHIB price has one catalyst that may push it higher in the next few days: Shibarium transactions. Data by ShibariumScan shows that the number of completed transactions in the layer-2 network has jumped to 947 million, meaning that it will soon hit the 1 billion milestone. As this CoinGape report wrote, Shibarium transactions hit the 500 million milestone in November. The number of Shibarium addresses has continued rising, moving from 100 million in January to over 124.5 million today. That is a sign that this address figure may get to 125 million this month. Shibarium’s success is a good thing for Shiba Inu price because some of the BONE fees generated in the network are converted into SHIB and burn. As such, Shiba Inu’s burn rate will grow as the network becomes more successful. However, Shibarium has more room to go to catch up to other popular layer-2 networks like Base and Arbitrum. It has a total value locked of just $2 million , much lower than mainstream layer 2 blockchains. Shibarium Stats SHIB Price Technicals Analysis: Bullish Patterns are Emerging Shiba Inu coin price is flashing bullish signs on the daily chart. First, the Average Directional Index, a popular indicator used to measure the strength of a trend, has pointed downwards, a sign that the downtrend is losing momentum. Second, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has formed a bullish divergence pattern as it moved slightly above the descending trendline that connects the highest swings since December 1. The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO), a unique form of MACD, has also formed a bullish divergence pattern. Most importantly, Shiba Inu price has slowly formed a falling wedge pattern. This pattern comprises two descending and converging trendlines, and a bullish breakout forms when they are about to meet. This convergence is happening at a crucial level since the price failed to move below the price several times in 2024. Shiba Inu Price Chart Shiba Inu Targets Therefore, these technical factors point to an eventual SHIB price breakout, potentially to last year’s high of $0.00003333, up by 150% above the current level. The bullish SHIB price forecast will become invalid if the coin crashes below the psychological point at $0.000010.

Instead, the proposed US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will contain Bitcoin seized from criminals during law enforcement investigations. Since the US government won’t do any crypto buying right now, investors started selling it off, leading to Bitcoin dropping 5% in value to around $87K. Let’s see how that has impacted the market and where it’s likely headed to next. How Will President Trump’s Executive Order Play Out Long-Term? The recent Bitcoin price dip could be seen by many as just normal market jitters, when things don’t go the way traders want them to. We saw these moments before when Bitcoin dropped more than 20% last month. It could also be argued that using forfeited criminal Bitcoins is actually not a bad idea. Instead of it being liquidated into cash, or sitting idle in a crypto account, it’s instead put to good use. After all, a lot of Bitcoin has been seized over the past decade, as this table shows. So why not use it? Year Amount Seized ($BTC) Estimated Value at Time of Seizure Notable Case 2013 30,000 ~$28 million Silk Road (FBI) 2016 119,756 ~$72 million Bitfinex Hack 2020 69,370 ~$1 billion Silk Road (Individual X) 2022 94,000 ~$3.6 billion Bitfinex Hack (Recovery) But even if there are good sides to something, it almost always comes down to how the markets react to these events. And how exactly is the market reacting? Let’s see. What Are Investors Thinking Right Now About The Trump Executive Order? There could be a couple schools of thought going on here inside investors’ minds. First, seizing crypto could be seen by some as unacceptable government overreach. If the President can order illegal Bitcoin to be taken, he or a successor could theoretically order legitimate Bitcoin to also be seized later if they deem it necessary to the national interest. Second, markets hate uncertainty and vagueness. Right now, the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is rather opaque in how it will be implemented, as well as how the reserve will be used. The executive order mandating the seizure of crypto taken by law enforcement was entirely unexpected. When the unexpected happens, the markets take a collective Prozac, play it safe, and start selling. And when the panicky markets start selling….the prices start dipping. It’s too soon to tell yet what long-term ramifications the executive order will have on crypto markets. But it’s a safe bet that investors are looking for new crypto to buy while they weather the Bitcoin squall. But which ones? The Best Crypto To Invest In Until Bitcoin Rallies Again Crypto presales are fairly immune to volatility, because they haven’t been listed yet on exchanges. Therefore, finding some good presales would be a savvy move to make. You can also look at other altcoins which may not be getting buffeted from being in the vicinity of Bitcoin’s current issues. Here are the best crypto to buy we think would be good ones to possibly park your funds in. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – A Coin That Will Be Used To Improve The Solana Blockchain Solaxy ($SOLX) is a prime example of one of the best presales of 2025 so far. Since its presale launch started back in December, it’s consistently maintained a competitive staking APY (currently at 162%). Its token price is also a very attractive $0.001656, so potential gains to be made here. What makes Solaxy so interesting is its intended long-term purpose. Although a meme coin doesn’t need a purpose in order to be successful, it also doesn’t hurt. In fact, investors find utility very appealing. In this case, the real world usage is the proposed upgrade of Solana, dubbed Solana L2. The current version of Solana has some persistent nagging issues which make it a bit of a pain to use. These include congestions leading to delayed transactions, sometimes failed transactions. With President Trump and his wife launching their coins on Solana , these problems were brought into sharper focus. By investing in $SOLX, you can help to make the Solana L2 blockchain fast, more reliable, and even cheaper to use. The L2 will bundle transactions together via roll-up technology and process them off-chain in optimized batches. Simply put, it offers faster transaction speeds and enhances scalability on Solana. You can even make some big gains on your Solaxy investment . 2. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – A Coin That Grants You Access to Exclusive Investment Funds If you’re looking for crypto safety, then we’re excited about Meme Index ($MEMEX) . By investing at $0.0166883 apiece, you’ll not only get a stonking 576% staking APY, but also gain admittance to four exclusive meme coin funds. Each fund has 8 meme coins in them, with a different risk level. You start off with the Titan Index (for less rewards but more stability) right up to the Frenzy Index (potentially more rewards, but less stability.) $MEMEX’s advantage is crystal clear. Basically, meme coins are very volatile. If you back the right coin, the rewards can be extremely nice . But invest in the wrong one and you could lose all your money. By investing in one of Meme Index’s funds, you spread the risk across all 8 coins contained within. If one coin falters, the other 7 coins still have a portion of your investment. You haven’t lost everything. You’d be annoyed, but not broke. $MEMEX’s presale ends in a little over 3 weeks. Now’s the time to jump on this winning ship! 3. Avalon Labs ($AVL) – Invest In Bitcoin-Backed Lending & Earn Yield Finally, we give you a glimpse into another of the best altcoins to follow. It isn’t a presale but it definitely caught our eye. Avalon Labs ($AVL) has seen a startling 77% jump over the last week. With a market cap of $100M, the last 24 hours trading volume hit 146%. Avalon offers investors the chance to earn rewards by loaning Bitcoin in a USDa credit line. These provide fixed borrow rates, an unlimited supply, and a 1:1 conversion to $USDT. The project brings makes crypto loans mainstream and help legitimize Bitcoin more, as governments start to adopt the currency for their own purposes. You may think it’s strange that we promote a Bitcoin-based coin when Bitcoin is currently sluggish. But there are high chances it will soon be back up again. Do Your Own Research! Before you invest, do your own research and decide for yourself if a presale is worth it. We can only provide recommendations, not guarantees. And of course, never invest money you can’t afford to lose.

On the other hand, the unemployment rate comes in at 4.1%, sparking market optimism over a potential rally in Bitcoin and altcoin prices. Notably, this data is widely considered by the US Federal Reserve to gauge the economic health and decide their rate cut plans. US Job Data: Here’s All You Should Know The market participants eagerly awaited the Labor Department’s US Job data for insights on the potential future move of the US Federal Reserve. Notably, the latest data showed that the US nonfarm payrolls increased by 151K in February, as compared to 143K noted in the prior month. However, the number comes in lower than the Wall Street expectations of 160K. On the other hand, the unemployment rate comes in at 4.1%, up from the prior month’s figure of 4%. Notably, the soaring unemployment rate and moderate job growth suggest that the Fed may turn dovish with its cautious approach to monetary policy. Notably, both these data marks the highest since December 2024. Meanwhile, the crypto market, including the Bitcoin and altcoins prices, has been closely tied to the performance of the US economy. Having said that, the latest job data may boost the market sentiment. As the Federal Reserve continues to navigate the economic landscape, crypto investors will be keeping a close eye on the central bank’s next moves. Impact Of US Job Data The crypto market recorded a slight recovery following the US Job data. However, despite that, the global crypto market cap was down 3.31% to $2.9 trillion. BTC price recovered and hovered at the $90K mark after dropping to as low as $84,717 in the last 24 hours. Simultaneously, the top altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and others, also traded in the green in the last one-hour timeframe. This reflects that the US Job data has helped boost the market sentiment. However, despite that, the CME FedWatch Tool showed that the market is betting towards no change in the Fed rate cut at their March gathering. Notably, the market now expects only two rate cuts through the year, given the recent hawkish comments by the Fed officials. Meanwhile, following the release, the US 10-year Bond Yield fell 1% to 4.239. On the other hand, the US Dollar Index slumped 0.45% to $103.570. What Lies Ahead For BTC & Altcoins? Although Bitcoin and altcoin prices have recorded heavy volatile trading lately, the market remains optimistic about the future trajectory of the digital assets. For context, the first White House Crypto Summit is scheduled later today, which will be closely watched by the global market participants. Besides, President Donald Trump is expected to announce a US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve in the roundtable gathering. Simultaneously, major developments regarding the top altcoins are also anticipated. For context, the US may lead towards a US Crypto Stockpile, where it could include altcoins like XRP, SOL, ADA, ETH, and others. This decision, if happens, could significantly boost the digital assets’ appeal which in turn could trigger a rally in the crypto market.

How are these cryptocurrencies doing as regards price? Should altcoins be included in a U.S. Digital Assets Reserve? While there are many voices heard on social media as to the merit of the four cryptocurrencies that will potentially form part of a U.S. Strategic Crypto Stockpile, some are even questioning as to why there should even be one. One of those voices is Tyler Winklevoss, who stated his view on X that cryptocurrencies are not suitable for a Strategic Reserve. That said, the U.S. government will either listen to voices such as Winklevoss, or Michael Saylor, who will be at the Crypto Summit later today, or it will submit to pressure and continue to back some of the major altcoins. $ETH ready for rally Source: TradingView Looking at the daily chart for $ETH, it is all pretty much steady as she goes. It looks as though the second biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin may have found a bottom, and bulls might be gathering ready to send the price higher. This bottom is formed by no less than the bull market trendline, together with major horizontal support. If these two were to fail, things could get very serious indeed. A bounce is certainly the most probable next move. At the bottom of the chart is the RSI. The indicator line here is showing that the downtrend is still in force. However, the trendline will have to break at some point, and once it does, a rally will be in evidence. $XRP breaks through descending trendline Source: TradingView The $XRP price has been in a range since the beginning of December 2024. This range has its low at $1.96, and the high at $2.90. While the price has generally been declining since the top at $3.40, the market surge of last Sunday did succeed in putting in a higher high. Also, on Thursday, the price broke out of the descending trendline, and will have confirmed the breakout on Friday, if the price can stay above the trendline. At the bottom of the chart, just as it is for $ETH, the RSI descending trendline remains to be broken to the upside. If this takes place, perhaps on good news later on Friday, a definitive break of the downtrend would be on course to happen. Can $SOL avoid a confirmation of the breakdown? Source: TradingView The beautiful uptrend for $SOL may have been brutally broken by this week’s weekly candle. That said, this has still not been confirmed. A complete candle body will need to open below the trendline for this confirmation to be officially made. So far the breakdown has been fought bravely by the $SOL bulls, with the price being bought all the way back up the previous week after it touched and confirmed the $127 major support. If Friday’s meeting does result in bullish news for Solana, and a rally over the weekend does ensue, the breakdown confirmation can be avoided. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart is signalling that the indicator lines are at the bottom. When they rise, and pass the 20.00 level, stand by for big upside price momentum. $ADA ready to break strong overhead resistance Source: TradingView $ADA is very much the weak link among the four cryptocurrencies. Down 71% since the all-time high of the last bull market, and with a major resistance rejecting the price since early December 2024, getting included in a Digital Assets Strategic Stockpile is just the tonic this altcoin needs. The price has recently reconfirmed the support at $0.77, and with the Stochastic RSI looking as though it could rise through the 20.00 level, this could be the start of a strong rally that breaks the overhead resistance and goes much higher. What happens if Friday’s meeting is a damp squib? With all this said for the four cryptocurrencies about to be included in the U.S. Digital Assets Strategic Reserve, if Friday’s meeting does become a damp squib, look out for some more pain to the downside.

Prominent American economist and Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff is arguing that the move was influenced by donor pressure and conflicting cabinet interests. Trump’s Executive Order President Trump formalized plans to create the reserve on March 6 via an executive order . The initiative will hold nearly 200,000 BTC seized by U.S. law enforcement throughout the years, with none being sold but instead kept as a sort of “digital Fort Knox” to preserve its value. Furthermore, the order also includes provisions for a digital asset stockpile that will hold altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP. However, the government has clarified that it will not actively buy additional assets for the stockpile, instead relying on forfeitures. It also stopped short of allowing new BTC purchases unless the coins were acquired at no cost to taxpayers. Critics like Schiff claim the decision is driven by political and financial interests. According to him, Trump was under pressure from conflicted cabinet members and donors, of which the crypto community made a sizable chunk, donating upwards of $22 million towards his re-election. “Under pressure from his donors and conflicted cabinet members, Trump just signed a bogus executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve using the Bitcoin the government already owns,” wrote Schiff. His concerns went beyond the reserve itself. He criticized the idea suggested by some of selling gold to fund BTC purchases, insisting that such sales would constitute a cost. “Paying for Bitcoin for gold is the same as paying cash,” he posted on X. However, some supporters countered that the move involves opportunity costs rather than direct taxpayer expenses. Only recently did the financial commentator reluctantly acknowledge the logic behind a Bitcoin reserve, even though he dismissed the need for altcoins like XRP, calling them unnecessary. A New Era for Bitcoin? Despite Schiff’s latest opposition, some see a national Bitcoin reserve as a milestone for the cryptocurrency’s adoption. Joe Burnett, Head of Market Research at Unchained, described Trump’s order as the start of the integration era for the asset. “With the establishment of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, the U.S. has taken its first real step toward integrating Bitcoin into the fabric of global finance,” said the analyst. Additionally, Burnett predicts that new financial offerings and deeper institutional exposure to BTC will come out of the move. “Expect to see new financial products designed around Bitcoin, from reserve-backed lending mechanisms to cross-border settlements that bypass outdated systems,” he asserted. In his opinion, Trump has set the trajectory for other nations, and he expects some to follow suit and lead while others will resist and risk being left behind.

I think this is a tough ranking system. 50 is probably a really good score .” CoinMarketCap’s website shows real-time data, charts, and metrics that track market trends and identify changes in altcoin dominance. This provides a clearer picture of market cycles and investor sentiment toward the assets. According to CMC, the threshold for determining an official “Altcoin Season” is when 75% of these altcoins outperform Bitcoin within three months. The index excludes stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and Dai (DAI), as well as asset-backed tokens such as Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), staked Ethereum (stETH), and Chainlink’s collateralized LINK (cLINK). It focuses solely on coins that operate independently of Bitcoin’s direct price movements. BERA, TRUMP and XRP among best performers against Bitcoin As of March, only 14 coins in the rankings beat BTC’s 3-month gains, including Berachain (BERA), the Official Trump token (TRUMP), Mantra (OM), Story (IP), and Ripple (XRP). The top two performers on the chart were newly launched tokens, Berachain and Trump’s Solana-based memecoin. BERA is currently changing hands at $6.71, up over 500% from its all-time low value of $1 on February 6, the date it was launched. TRUMP is trading 82% from its January 19 high of $75.35 but has maintained a value that is slightly over 100% more than those during its debut. Other coins in the list that had between 60-70% gains in the last 90 days included exchange-based tokens like Bitget (BGB), Gate (GT), and decentralized autonomous organization protocol DeXe (DEXE), which recorded 64.04%, 64.71%, and 64.04%, respectively. One market analyst, quoting Zhao’s post, talked about how lackluster the state of the altcoin market is now, saying: “ New launches there are kinda meh but CT once again missing plenty of good opps . The fact that out of 14 alts that outperformed, 2 are new launches and 2 are gold proxies is CRAZY how down bad are alts this cycle. ” ‘Wen’ alt season? Historically, Altcoin Seasons have been marked by periods where alternative cryptocurrencies collectively gain prominence over Bitcoin. One of the most notable instances occurred between February and May 2021, when the combined market capitalization of the top 100 altcoins surged to 130% of Bitcoin’s market cap. During these cycles, altcoins often experience rapid price appreciation, sometimes delivering significantly higher returns than Bitcoin . Large-cap altcoins saw average returns of 174%, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 2% growth over the same period. Per CMC’s data , in the last year, altcoins last took charge of the market during the November-December 2024 bull run, which saw a total of 87 out of the 100 top-ranked alts outperform the largest crypto by market cap. Market sentiment during such times tends to be overwhelmingly bullish, which leads to increasing trading volumes and a price volatility index uptick. The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also creeps into traders, and starts a period of high buying and selling activity. Some members of the crypto community predict the altcoin season will come in the last quarter of 2025, just like the previous year. But for others, like market watchers Rawl_xbt, this year will not have any Trump market effect if the US Federal Reserve does not cut interest rates, which could cause a recession. “ It doesn’t make any sense for the altcoin season to be in Q4 this year because we are getting closer and closer to a QE slowdown…. the worst scenario is that if Jerome will not cut rates or atleast giving any clue that will do so, then most likely a recession will come and markets will crash ,” he remarked on X.

Cardano's daily active addresses and transaction volumes have significantly declined, indicating low network usage despite its high market capitalization. Cardano's DeFi activity shows a growing trend, but its Total Value Locked remains underwhelming, and its stablecoin footprint is limited without Tether or USD Coin. Without concrete plans from the administration, ADA's price spikes are likely hype-based, presenting opportunities to reduce holdings due to the chain's low activity. When I last covered the Cardano ( ADA-USD ) blockchain in February 2024, I labeled it a ""network that needs a catalyst."" Well, a little over a year later, we may have that catalyst. A lot can change in a year. And for cryptocurrencies like ADA, even a single day can bring about an enormous move in the valuation of an asset. In a March 2nd Truth Social post , US President Donald Trump announced plans for a strategic crypto reserve. To the chagrin of some within the digital asset community, ADA was one of the tokens mentioned for inclusion in such a reserve. Performance since 2/14/24 (Seeking Alpha) The price quickly re-rated substantially higher, from 65 cents to well over $1 per coin. In fact, ADA was actually about flat from my February 2024 article the day prior to Trump's Truth Social post announcing the strategic reserve. While it had admittedly out-performed Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) over that time frame – an asset that I've been long – I believe that discrepancy has been more indicative of fundamental issues with Ethereum rather than a strong bullish case for Cardano. In this article, we'll again dive into on-chain activity for Cardano and look at what, if any, stablecoin footprint the network has since that is a segment of the industry that is becoming increasingly more important. Cardano Network Usage Data I would encourage everyone to keep in mind that when I share this usage data, my intention is not to get into 'what ifs,' hopes, dreams, or technical capabilities. I'm merely sharing what is actually happening. And like it or not, Cardano is a blockchain that has rightfully (in my eyes) earned a reputation as being a network that is valued purely on future expectations rather than observable utility. Again, we're talking about actual usage here, not capabilities. The reality is, there is very little activity happening on this blockchain compared to every other chain with a top-ten market capitalization – with the exception of XRPL ( XRP-USD ). Cardano Monthly DAA Trend (Artemis) For the month of February, Cardano's Daily Active Address (or DAA) average was 29.4k addresses per day. The network averaged 46.6k DAAa during February 2024 and 37.7k in January. While there was a noticeable pop in DAAs during November and December last year, the reality is Cardano's daily active address averages haven't sniffed the six-figure highs of 2021 and early 2022. Cardano Monthly Transactions (Artemis) It's a very similar trend for Cardano in transactions. At 1.3 million total transactions in the month of February, network transactions were down 32% from January and 35% year over year. Compared to other chains, these are very low levels of activity given ADA's current valuation: Network (24hrs) DAAs Transactions TVL Market capitalization Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) 603,520 386,183 $5.4b $1.7 trillion Ethereum 412,504 1,342,176 $48.5b $269.5 billion BSC ( BNB-USD ) 1,137,049 4,654,780 $4.9b $85.7 billion Solana ( SOL-USD ) 4,707,304 54,429,320 $6.9b $73.8 billion Cardano 32,381 50,094 $268m $22.8 billion Tron ( TRX-USD ) 2,762,108 8,936,051 $4.7b $20 billion Source: Artemis Where these other chains with multi-billion market valuations have DAAs in the hundreds of thousands or millions, Cardano's are measured in the tens of thousands. The same is true of transactions. Even Total Value Locked, or 'TVL' for Cardano is hugely underwhelming at $268 million. For a smart contract blockchain with a top 10 market capitalization, one would expect this figure to be higher. DeFi and Stablecoin Supply Though I'd personally call it underwhelming from a nominal standpoint at $427 million, Cardano's DeFi activity is generally growing based on TVL data going back to 2022: Cardano TVL and Stable Supply (DeFi Llama) On the surface, the network appears to be enduring 'boom and bust' type cycles where TVL increases sharply before coming back down to trend. Importantly, the multi-year trend is indeed higher. But keep in mind, this is the trend measured in dollars. Measured in ADA, Cardano TVL actually peaked in December 2023 and then 'double topped' in November 2024: Cardano TVL in ADA (DeFi Llama) Since then, the trend has generally been down and at levels not seen since summer 2023. One bright spot has been the growth in stablecoins. Not just in an aggregate figure sense, but also in choice of assets: Cardano Stablecoin Dominance (DeFi Llama) Prior to last summer, there were essentially just two stablecoin tokens on Cardano. That figure is now four different tokens, with top coin dominance coming in at just 35.8% share of the market. Notably, neither Tether ( USDT-USD ) nor USD Coin ( USDC-USD ) have been issued on Cardano. There are some within the community who view this as a missed opportunity for Cardano while others prefer the network remain home to tokens that are more aligned with Cardano's success rather than the chain-agnostic leaders in the stablecoin space. Closing Takeaways My personal view is that 'altcoin' inclusion in any US 'strategic crypto reserve' is acceptable, provided those tokens can be used to facilitate cross-border stablecoin settlement. Otherwise, I don't see a real purpose for the US government holding numerous digital assets in reserve. To be sure, there is a case to be made for an asset like Bitcoin due to what I'd call market 'acceptance' that it is here to stay as an anti-fiat asset. But for smart contract chains that are used for DeFi and settlement of tokenized USD, I'd assume the United States would want to support networks that are home to dollar assets with T-bill backing. Without Tether and Circle issuing the market-leading stables on Cardano, it's difficult for me to see ADA really being necessary for a strategic reserve. Of course, time will tell on all of this, and the submission of this article pre-dates Trump's 'crypto summit' on March 7th. But without concrete plans from the administration on allocation and timeline, I think hype-based pops in the price of ADA are probably opportunities to lighten up given the lack of users and activity relative to peers.",ADA-USD,EN,0,0,ADA|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-07 14:00:00

However, one of the most underappreciated yet significant factors in Bitcoin’s price action is Global Liquidity. Many investors may be underutilizing this metric or even misunderstanding how it impacts BTC’s cyclical trends. Table of Contents Impact on Bitcoin Year-on-Year Change Liquidity Lag Bitcoin Outlook Conclusion Impact on Bitcoin With increasing discussions on platforms like Twitter (X) and analysts dissecting liquidity charts, understanding the relationship between Global Liquidity and Bitcoin has become crucial for traders and long-term investors alike. However, recent divergences suggest that traditional interpretations might require a more nuanced approach. Follow The Money pic.twitter.com/w3flghlwn4 — Bitcoin Magazine Pro (@BitcoinMagPro) March 5, 2025 Global M2 money supply refers to the total liquid money supply, including cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near-money assets. Traditionally, when Global M2 expands, capital seeks higher-yielding assets, including Bitcoin, equities, and commodities. Conversely, when M2 contracts, risk assets often decline in value due to tighter liquidity conditions. Figure 1: Global Liquidity is increasing, yet recently the Bitcoin price has decreased. View Live Chart Historically, we’ve seen Bitcoin’s price follow the Global M2 expansion, rising when liquidity increases and suffering during contractions. However, in this cycle, we’ve seen a deviation: despite a steady increase in Global M2, Bitcoin’s price action has shown inconsistencies. Year-on-Year Change Rather than simply tracking the absolute value of Global M2, a more insightful approach is to analyze its year-on-year rate of change. This method accounts for the velocity of liquidity expansion or contraction, revealing a clearer correlation with Bitcoin’s performance. When we compare the Bitcoin Year-on-Year Return (YoY) with Global M2 YoY Change , a much stronger relationship emerges. Bitcoin’s strongest bull runs align with periods of rapid liquidity expansion, while contractions precede price declines or prolonged consolidation phases. Figure 2: Global Liquidity yearly rate of change provides greater insight into liquidity cycles. View Live Chart For example, during Bitcoin’s consolidation phase in early 2025, Global M2 was steadily increasing, but its rate of change was flat. Only when M2’s expansion accelerates noticeably can Bitcoin break out towards new highs. Liquidity Lag Another key observation is that Global Liquidity does not impact Bitcoin instantly. Research suggests that Bitcoin lags behind Global Liquidity changes by approximately 10 weeks. By shifting the Global Liquidity indicator forward by 10 weeks, the correlation with Bitcoin strengthens significantly. However, further optimization suggests that the most accurate lag is around 56 to 60 days, or approximately two months. Figure 3: The strongest correlation occurs when liquidity data is delayed by two months. Bitcoin Outlook Throughout most of 2025, Global Liquidity has been in a flattening phase following a significant expansion in late 2024 that propelled Bitcoin to new highs. This flattening coincided with Bitcoin’s consolidation and retracement to around $80,000. However, if historical trends hold, a recent resurgence in liquidity growth should translate into another leg up for BTC by late March. Figure 4: Liquidity is surging, but it may take a few more weeks for BTC to really benefit. Conclusion Monitoring Global Liquidity is an essential macro indicator for anticipating Bitcoin’s trajectory. However, rather than relying on static M2 data, focusing on its rate of change and understanding the two-month lag effect offers a much more precise predictive framework. As Global economic conditions evolve and central banks adjust their monetary policies, Bitcoin’s price action will continue to be influenced by liquidity trends. The coming weeks will be pivotal; Bitcoin could be poised for a major move if Global Liquidity continues its renewed acceleration. Enjoyed this?

With uncertainty gripping the market, analysts expect even more volatility in the coming days as traders react to major developments in the crypto space. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Could Gain Momentum For A Move To $150,000 If Bulls Reclaim This Level – Details According to White House Crypto and AI czar David Sacks, President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This unexpected move has sparked renewed speculation about how government involvement in crypto could impact broader market trends. Despite the chaos, Ethereum has managed to hold the key $2,000-$2,100 support zone, a crucial level that traders are watching closely. Top analyst Daan shared insights on X, highlighting that ETH has so far defended this major demand level despite the extreme volatility. The next few trading sessions will be pivotal, with Ethereum hovering near a critical price range. If ETH can hold support and regain momentum, a reversal could be on the horizon. However, failure to maintain these levels could trigger another wave of selling, deepening the current market correction. Ethereum Faces A Crucial Test The market enters a critical moment. Ethereum’s price has lost over 50% of its value since late December, sparking massive fear and panic selling. The steep decline has left many investors questioning whether the long-awaited alt season will even happen this year, as Ethereum and most altcoins struggle to reclaim bullish momentum. With ETH failing to establish a strong uptrend, analysts remain divided on whether a recovery is possible in the near term. Some believe that the current price action signals deeper weakness, suggesting that Ethereum could face further downside before seeing any meaningful reversal. Others, however, see potential for a rebound, especially as ETH continues to hold key demand zones. Daan’s technical analysis on X points out that Ethereum has managed to hold critical demand as a good sign amid recent market dynamics. This support, around $2,000, has been tested multiple times and remains a crucial area for bulls to defend. Daan also noted that Ethereum has formed a higher low on lower timeframes, indicating a possible reversal if momentum builds. He emphasized that for ETH to regain bullish structure, it needs to break above $2,300 and fill the inefficiency left from Monday’s full retrace. A decisive move above this level would confirm strength and could trigger a push toward higher price targets.

While Ethereum’s outlook remains uncertain, its ability to hold key levels suggests that a recovery is still possible. The next few trading sessions will be critical in determining whether ETH can reclaim bullish momentum or continue to struggle amid broader market weakness. ETH Price Action: Technical Levels Ethereum has entered an intense phase where uncertainty dominates price action and speculation drives market sentiment. With traders searching for direction, ETH is currently trading at $2,200, having established key support above $2,000. However, this level remains fragile, and bulls must continue to defend it to prevent further downside. For Ethereum to confirm a recovery rally, it needs to push above $2,500, reclaiming lost ground and shifting momentum back in favor of buyers. A move above this level would signal renewed strength, potentially setting ETH up for a strong rebound. However, until bulls break past resistance levels, ETH remains in a high-risk zone where volatility can drive price swings in either direction. The $2,000 support zone remains the key factor in determining Ethereum’s fate for the coming year. If ETH holds this level, it could serve as a foundation for long-term growth. However, if it breaks down, selling pressure could intensify, leading to a prolonged bearish trend.

At that time when this company entered the crypto market , not many public companies were enthusiastic about embracing Bitcoin. However, under the leadership of Michael Saylor, the company adopted an aggressive BTC investment strategy. Currently, it holds no fewer than 499,096 BTC tokens. Naturally, it made impressive headlines when the price of BTC achieved the $100K milestone. Since February 4, the BTC market has never closed above the $100K level. Currently, the BTC price stands at around $88,724.95 – at least 11.26% below the milestone. Has the price dip made any impact on the MSTR market? If ‘yes’, has Saylor’s strategy failed? Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Buying Strategy A key component of MicroStrategy’s BTC investment strategy is Dollar-Cost Averaging. DCA is a very simple investment strategy. Instead of investing a large sum of money all at once, you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals. This justifies why the company purchased BTC when the price was at a peak range of $95K and $106K. Massive Losses from Recent Bitcoin Purchases Since the peak of $106K, the price of BTC has plummeted by approximately 16.28%. At the start of February, the price was around $100,621.97. On the second day, it closed above $101,305.27. On the third day, the market saw a single day drop of 3.49%.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other altcoins have important catalysts that may push it higher in the next few months. It was trading at $90,000, up by about 15% from the lowest level this month. First, US bond yields have retreated from their highest levels this year. The benchmark ten-year yield dropped from 4.8% in January to 4.24%. The 30-year and five-year yields have also slipped in the past few weeks. Falling bond yields is a sign that the market anticipates that the Federal Reserve will deliver more interest rate cuts this year. Economists are pricing in three cuts after the US released a series of weak economic data. Consumer and business confidence has fallen after Donald Trump added tariffs on key US trading partners . The labor market has also softened, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.1% in February and nonfarm payrolls rising by 151,000, which is lower than the expected 159,000.

The chart below shows that Bitcoin has a close correlation with the global M2 money supply. BTC and M2 money flow correlation | Source: BGeometrics Bitcoin price technical analysis BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the BTC price has held steady in the past few days, rising from a low of $78,000 last week to $90,000. Bitcoin has remained above the ascending trendline, which has connected the lowest swings since August of last year. It has also moved above the 50-day moving average and the weak, stop & reverse point of the Murrey Math Lines. Therefore, Bitcoin needs to rise above the strong, pivot, and reverse level at $93,750 to confirm the bullish breakout. This price coincides with the highest level this week. A move above that level will point to more gains, potentially to $100,000.

This bold forecast has fueled speculation among traders, with many anticipating Bitcoin to lead the charge. The timing of this projection aligns with an upcoming global crypto summit, adding momentum to market sentiment. Cryptocurrencies Price Outlook as Analysts Eye a $10 Trillion Crypto Market Market experts believe the projected $10 trillion valuation reflects the growing adoption of digital assets worldwide. Bitcoin demonstrates potential to break resistance barriers which would fuel this expansion according to analyst projections. The rising institutional interest drives traders to predict an intensified upward price trend. Standard Chartered’s Geoffrey Kendrick maintains positive views about Bitcoin’s future success. According to his estimates BTC Price may achieve $200,000 this year on its way to reaching $500,000 during the upcoming years. The market changes have not altered Bitcoin’s market expansion path according to Kendrick’s assessment because institutions are expanding their Bitcoin use and regulations support further growth. Crypto Summit Builds Anticipation as Institutions Monitor Market The upcoming major crypto summit will feature industry leaders to conduct a discussion about digital assets’ future direction. Participants closely follow this event because they expect vital insights that will steer short-term price behavior. The regulatory evolution and policy transformations regarding Bitcoin show strong interest to institutional market participants. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump is engaging with cryptocurrencies price executives at the White House. Political interest toward the crypto sector continues to increase yet this development raises questions about possible ethical conflicts. The cryptocurrency industry currently needs both acknowledgment from political institutions and regulatory guidelines while Trump’s involvement occurs at this time. Trump has signed an executive order to establish a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve . However, the order does not include new Bitcoin purchases, disappointing some market participants. Following the announcement, Bitcoin price dropped sharply, falling more than 7% in the last 24 hours to trade below $85,000. Crypto Market Reacts to White House Summit as Bitcoin Price Drops The broader crypto market has also experienced turbulence, with major cryptocurrencies seeing declines. Ethereum price fell by 5%, trading around $2,180, while XRP dropped 2%, hovering near $2.50. The total global crypto market cap declined by 2.16% in the past day, reflecting increased volatility ahead of the summit. The market behaves positively for the long term despite its current short-term withdrawal. Analysis shows new high Bitcoin price will result from rising institutional involvement along with regulatory improvements. The U.S. moves toward cryptocurrency adoption might lead additional nations to accept cryptocurrency which would support market expansion. Traders keep a close eye on White House crypto summit events because they expect these developments to affect Cryptocurrencies price movements. The price needs correction, but the crypto market exhibits long-term bullishness since analysts predict a $10 trillion market value that boosts optimism throughout the crypto ecosystem.

Nasdaq appears to be adopting strategies from the crypto markets with this initiative. The aim is to give investors more flexibility, align with global markets, and enhance access to capital. Nasdaq president Tal Cohen stated that the exchange is working to ensure the necessary infrastructure and regulatory frameworks are in place before implementation. The initiative would make Nasdaq the first major U.S. stock exchange to operate around the clock, a shift from the traditional 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time trading hours. “We are excited to share that Nasdaq has begun engaging with regulators, market participants and other key stakeholders,” Cohen wrote, “with a view of enabling 24-hour trading five days a week on the Nasdaq Stock Market.” This means the markets would still close on the weekends. Currently, pre-market and after-hours sessions offer limited extended trading. Nasdaq’s 24-hour model could significantly impact market liquidity, allowing investors to react to global events in real-time without waiting for markets to open.

Nasdaq’s shift could further integrate crypto-related products into mainstream markets. With spot Bitcoin ETFs, such as BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust , gaining traction, the ability to trade these instruments at all hours could enhance liquidity and price discovery.

The market is however shifting, and technical analysis says that DOGE could be heading for a major downturn. Experts are sounding the alarm that a death cross is close at hand, a bearish sign that may lead to significant price drops. Meanwhile, a rising competitor, DTX Exchange, is capturing attention at just $0.18 per token, offering traders a fresh opportunity in the evolving crypto landscape. Could DTX be the altcoin that dominates 2025 while DOGE struggles to stay afloat? Dogecoin’s Death Cross Signals Trouble According to TradingView and U.Today, Dogecoin is approaching a death cross, a chart pattern that takes place when the 50-day moving average goes below the 200-day moving average. If this pattern continues, analysts predict DOGE to fall to $0.18, which is a 26% decline from its current position. In the most extreme scenario, Dogecoin's price may drop even lower to $0.13, which will result in a 40% drop in current levels and a 72% crash in its record highs. Yet, there is a rumor that the market already accounts for this event. Some traders believe that the death cross could be a bear trap and thus may trigger a potential stabilization or even a bounce in price. Nevertheless, overall sentiment is still bearish as meme coins struggle in the crypto space. Source: Tradingview Elon Musk’s Influence Faces Its Biggest Test Elon Musk has been a key driver of Dogecoin price action in the past. His X (formerly Twitter) posts, Tesla merchandise purchases with DOGE, and public statements have helped fuel Dogecoin rallies. Yet even Musk's power appears to be declining against technical issues and a struggling wider crypto market. Can Musk reverse the death cross or will Dogecoin's price continue to slip further? Some are still hopeful that Musk will continue to show support for DOGE, either through Twitter integration or other projects. However, as the charts turn red and sentiment shifts, many investors are beginning to lose confidence in Dogecoin’s ability to recover. DTX Exchange: The $0.18 Token That Signals the End of the Meme Coin Era With the crypto space growing, the emergence of tokens that have real-world utility, such as DTX, indicates that the era of meme coins is fading. Although Dogecoin was a huge success story, its future hangs in the balance, particularly with technical indicators like the Death Cross flashing a bearish signal to investors. As Dogecoin threat of a catastrophic decline, a new altcoin is moving into the spotlight: DTX Exchange, currently trading at merely $0.18, DTX has attracted massive attention, especially from those interested in diversifying from meme coins to projects that have greater utility and growth prospects. Unlike DOGE, DTX is a real utility token. DTX is already gaining momentum, having launched with a $0.36 listing price, meaning early investors stand to double their investment. But DTX isn’t just about price—it’s reshaping the landscape of crypto exchanges. DTX Exchange provides non-custodial trading, which means that users have complete control over their assets and never have to worry about frozen accounts or data loss. It also has deep liquidity, providing efficient and smooth trading with little price slippage, which new exchanges cannot easily provide. As Dogecoin struggles with declining momentum, investors are seeking something better. DTX Exchange has renewed interest due to its solid institutional support and practical value. At just $0.18, the presale is almost sold out which shows great investor confidence and makes it as a leader in the crypto space. Will Dogecoin survive, or will DTX take the lead? The choice is in the hands of investors.

President Fulfills Key Campaign Pledge U.S. President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, marking a significant shift in the federal government’s approach to digital assets. The reserve will be funded using bitcoin seized through criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings, ensuring no direct cost to taxpayers. The announcement comes just ahead of Trump’s scheduled meeting with cryptocurrency industry executives at the White House, reinforcing his administration’s commitment to strengthening the U.S. digital asset sector. Composition of the Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile Alongside the Bitcoin Reserve, the executive order also mandates the creation of a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile. This stockpile will include other digital assets, such as Ether (ETH), Ripple XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA), which were among the five cryptocurrencies Trump publicly acknowledged earlier in the week. The announcement led to a surge in market value for these assets. Unlike the Bitcoin Reserve, which will be held as a long-term store of value, the Digital Asset Stockpile will be managed under the Treasury Department for responsible oversight. The government will not purchase additional digital assets beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings. Government Holdings and Strategy It is estimated that the U.S. government possesses approximately 200,000 BTC, though no full audit has been conducted to verify the holdings. The executive order directs a comprehensive review of all federal digital asset reserves to establish an accurate accounting. According to White House crypto czar, David Hacks, premature bitcoin sales by the government have led to significant financial losses, with estimates suggesting over $17 billion in missed value. The new strategy ensures that bitcoin within the reserve will not be liquidated, with Hacks likening it to a digital equivalent of Fort Knox. He also claimed that the Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to explore budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin provided such acquisitions do not impose incremental costs on taxpayers. Administration’s Crypto Vision Hacks believes that the move aligns with President Trump’s broader vision of positioning the U.S. as a leader in cryptocurrency innovation and adoption. He also emphasized the administration’s commitment to fostering digital asset growth, praising the President’s decisive action. Additionally, the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, played a key role in shaping the initiative. Executive Director Bo Hines was also recognized for his contributions. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, DOGE may now be on the verge of a massive 42% price decline after a bearish pattern emerged. As the broader market continues to face a massive pullback, how low can Dogecoin price go? At press time, Dogecoin price trades at $0.205 with a marginal 0.3% drop in 24 hours. Dogecoin Price at Risk as Death Cross Approaches Dogecoin price has been defending a crucial support level at $0.19 despite a lack of fresh demand. However, DOGE is facing an imminent crash if it confirms a death cross on its daily chart. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average is tipping south and nearing a crossover with the 200-day EMA. If DOGE confirms this bearish crossover, it could fuel a notable price drop. The last time that Dogecoin faced a death cross, the price plunged by 42%. If this were to happen again, Dogecoin price could extend its decline to $0.11. The RSI at 38 shows a lack of buying momentum to defend the current support level. This raises the chances of the meme coin extending its decline if the bearish sentiment in the broader crypto market continues. DOGE/USD: 1-day Chart Dogecoin Sheds Over $3B in Open Interest Dogecoin has also witnessed a staggering decline in open interest after shedding more than $3 billion in less than two months. DOGE’s open interest hit a peak of $5.42 billion in mid-January, but it has since dropped to $1.81 billion according to Coinglass data. Dogecoin Open Interest This rapid decrease in open interest shows risk aversion among Dogecoin traders as they fail to open new positions. However, this decline could also give the Dogecoin price a chance to recover. After the many open positions were forcefully closed due to recent price fluctuations, the reduced leverage could give room for a more natural recovery. Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Price Recovery Despite Bearish Trends Despite the recent downtrend, one crypto market analyst has provided a bullish Dogecoin price prediction , and forecasted that the meme coin could soon rally to a record high. According to Solberg Invest, DOGE was testing a crucial support level, and if it bounces, it could spark a recovery towards $0.82. DOGE/USDT: 1-day Chart Dogecoin could only make an independent rally to an ATH if there are catalysts such as an ETF approval or a massive endorsement. However, with neither of these factors at play, a Dogecoin price recovery is largely dependent on how the broader market performs.

This marks the latest crypto play linked to US President Trump who has promised the industry clarity around crypto regulations and a federal crypto reserve. According to a statement posted on WLFI’s blog, the agreement will see WLFI incorporating Sui Network tokens into its cryptocurrency portfolio, titled “Macro Strategy”, which already holds leading projects Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH) alongside DeFi coins like Ondo ($ONDO), Tron ($TRX), and Chainlink ($LINK). Additionally, both projects will collaborate to explore potential “product development opportunities.” “Our selection of Sui stems from its U.S.-originated innovation, coupled with its impressive scalability and adoption,” stated co-founder of World Liberty Financial, Zak Folkman, in the blog post. “With our objective to back core DeFi assets in the coming months, partnering with Sui was a clear and strategic choice.” Sui Price Analysis – Where is SUI Headed Next? At the peak of its overnight rally, SUI climbed nearly 10%, reaching close to $3 before retreating slightly. It is now trading at $2.76, having climbed over the past 24 hours. Ultimately, Sui Network’s overnight gains have done little to reverse the token’s general decline since the start of the year. Broadly speaking its decline is in line with market leader Bitcoin’s, however breaking past the $3 resistance level remains a key objective for SUI bulls in the short-term. With a relative strength index hovering around 51, the Sui Network token is well-priced right now, but global macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty could continue, resulting in selloffs, which largely hit crypto and the stock market hardest. As Sui Network Rallies, Best Wallet Continues to Attract New Investment With the general outlook of the $8.8 billion cap Sui Network being tied to the fate of all leading cryptocurrencies, many are diversifying their portfolio by investing in presales projects with high upside potential.

This time, decentralized exchange aggregator 1inch has fallen victim to a major hack, resulting in a loss of over $5 million. On chain experts suggest that a hacker found a vulnerability in one of 1inch’s smart contracts, leading to the massive theft. Following the attack, the price of the 1inch token dropped by 5%, causing concern among users. But how exactly did the hacker pull this off? How the Hacker Stole $5 Million? On March 6, 1inch officially confirmed the hack through a tweet, explaining that the attacker took advantage of a flaw in the outdated Fusion v1 smart contract. This vulnerability specifically impacted resolver entities, which are responsible for filling orders on the platform. The good news is that user funds remained secure, as the losses were limited to the affected resolver contracts. However, this didn’t stop the hacker from making a huge profit. However, blockchain security firm SlowMist traced the stolen funds , revealing that the hacker managed to steal 2.4 million USDC and 1,276 Wrapped Ether (WETH), totaling over $5 million. 1inch’s Quick Response to the Attack As soon as the exploit was discovered, the 1inch team acted fast. They immediately started working with affected resolvers to secure their systems and prevent further losses. The platform also urged all resolvers to audit and update their smart contracts to avoid similar attacks. To strengthen security, 1inch announced a bug bounty program, encouraging ethical hackers to find and report any vulnerabilities before bad actors can exploit them. Additionally, efforts are being made to recover the stolen funds. 1inch Price Outlook Following news of the hack, the 1inch token price tumbled more than 5% as panic spread among investors. As of now, the 1inch token is trading around $0.23 , reflecting a 2% drop in the last 24 hours. However, its trading volume has spiked by 10%, now hovering around $26.8 million. Technical analysts suggest that if 1inch manages to break above the key resistance level of $0.25, its price could climb to $0.28. A strong bullish push might even send it soaring to $0.32. On the downside, if the price drops below $0.22, it could sink further to $0.19.",News,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|USDC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-07 15:38:07

Historical trends show that if the index drops over 3.5% within two weeks after such a run, a bear market may follow, while a lesser decline could lead to gains. The next two weeks will be critical for market direction, according to Sentimentrader. March 7, 2025 14:00:47 UTC DXY Index Plunges: Echoes of Past Bitcoin Bottoms The DXY Index, which measures the U.S. dollar’s strength, has seen one of its sharpest one-week drops since 2013—exceeding a -4 standard deviation move, a rarity linked to previous Bitcoin bottoms. Past occurrences, such as during the FTX collapse (November 2022), the COVID-19 plunge (March 2020), and the 2015 bear market, led to significant Bitcoin rebounds. Although the DXY remains strong at 103.8, its accelerated decline is a notable signal for risk assets. March 7, 2025 14:00:47 UTC Fold Holdings Boosts Bitcoin Treasury by 475 BTC Fold Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: FLD) has increased its Bitcoin treasury by 475 BTC, bringing total holdings to over 1,485 BTC. This move positions Fold among the top ten U.S. public companies with the largest Bitcoin reserves. The company acquired the additional Bitcoin through a convertible note at a 100% premium, reinforcing its strategy of bridging traditional finance with the Bitcoin economy. CEO Will Reeves emphasized Fold’s commitment to driving shareholder value and leading the charge in a new financial era powered by Bitcoin adoption.

The unemployment rate in February climbed to 4.1%, up from both the expected rate of 4.0% and the previous 4.0% reading. This lower-than-anticipated job growth, along with a slight rise in unemployment, could signal underlying challenges in the labor market, potentially affecting economic outlook and policy decisions.

His comments, one of the last before the March 18-19 policy meeting, come as trade-war worries continue despite Trump’s pause on tariffs from Mexico and Canada.

Bitcoin dropped near $84K, while ETH and XRP fell by 4.2% and 1.32% respectively amid a declining US dollar index. Analysts expect heightened volatility as labor data unfolds. Technical levels indicate support around $85K for Bitcoin and key resistance zones, leaving traders cautious ahead of rate cuts. March 7, 2025 13:23:24 UTC When is Next FOMC Meeting? Markets now expect three Fed rate cuts this year—up from earlier forecasts—following the February 7 jobs report. Wall Street worries that Trump’s tariffs and counter-tariffs could spark inflation, potentially triggering stagflation (low growth with rising prices). With the February 2025 CPI data due on March 12 and the next FOMC meeting scheduled for March 18–19, uncertainty mounts over the impact of aggressive rate cuts on the economy.

He will address the economy, inflation risks, and the impact of Trump’s new tariffs, just hours after the February jobs report. This timely speech is expected to provide critical insights into current economic challenges and the Fed’s policy direction amid rising inflation and trade uncertainties.

Ripple wavered as crypto analysts debated whether it should be added in the Strategic Crypto Reserve, with one of them arguing that it was not geopolitically neutral. XRP Price Wavers as Analyst Blasts Odds of Ripple Being in Strategic Reserves Donald Trump’s decision to include USA coins into Strategic crypto reserves has ignited XRP price rally and debate in the crypto community. In a recent X post , Garlinghouse argued that strategic crypto reserves should include multiple coins. He pointed to the fact that he was a big advocate for a level playing field instead of pitting one token against another. He also argued that maximalism was the real enemy of crypto progress. In a response, Willy Woo, a popular crypto analyst, argued that the reserves should only be Bitcoin. He argued that BTC was geopolitically neutral and that many countries would find it difficult to buy XRP reserves. He said: “ Dear CEO of XRP, living in the US, tell me which countries would buy US-controlled XRP if the strategic reserve needed to be put to work . BTC is a geopolitically neutral asset like Gold. You’re gaslighting people into thinking XRP is a strategic reserve asset.” Other popular players in the crypto industry have argued against including other altcoins in these reserves. For example, Tyler Winklevoss, the CEO of Gemini argued that an asset needed to be “hard money” that is a proven store of value like gold. Tylor Winklevoss X Post The inclusion of Ripple in strategic crypto reserves would be a bullish catalyst for XRP’s price as it would lead to more purchases by the government and US-based corporations. Notably, such a move would happen as the Securities and Exchange Commission considers whether to approve a spot XRP ETF . According to JPMorgan, a XRP ETF would attract over $8 billion in inflows in the first year. Ripple (XRP) Technical Analysis: H&S Pattern Points to a Crash The daily chart shows that Ripple (XRP) price has largely moved sideways in the past few months. This is a big difference from when it went parabolic in November. There is a risk that the coin will have a bearish breakdown in the next few days, as it has formed a head-and-shoulders pattern. The head is at the year-to-date high of $3.416, while the shoulders are at $2.73, which coincides with the 23.6% retracement level. The neckline is at $1.96. Therefore, there is a risk that the XRP price will have a bearish breakdown in the coming days. This view will become valid when the coin drops below the neckline at $1.9615. Such a move will point to more downside, potentially to %1.1340, the 78.6% retracememt level. XRP Price Chart A move above the right shoulder at $2.73 and the psychological point at $3 will invalidate the bullish Ripple price forecast and point to more gains to last year’s high of $3.41.

This not only strengthens APC’s credibility but also fuels price growth by continuously shrinking supply. With supply decreasing and demand skyrocketing, the burning mechanism adds an extra layer of value that long-term investors crave. ChillVille Awaits – APC’s $0.00007 Entry Won’t Last! Arctic Pablo Coin has reached its 13th phase, ChillVille, and history has shown that each phase disappears quicker than the last. The presale has already soared through 12 locations in record time, securing over $1.77 million in investments. Right now, APC is available at just $0.00007, but as new locations open, the price will keep climbing. With an ROI of 11,285.71% from this stage to the listing price of $0.008, the window to lock in maximum gains is closing fast. Every time Arctic Pablo Coin moves to a new location, the price increases. Investors who secured APC in earlier phases have already multiplied their holdings significantly, and those waiting on the sidelines risk missing out as prices surge. This presale model is designed for high engagement, making each new phase a crucial entry point. Analyst Predictions – The $500 Bet That Could Turn into $714,063! Crypto analysts predict that Arctic Pablo Coin could hit $0.1 post-listing, and the math is staggering. Buying at $0.00007 means a $500 investment today would secure 7,140,635 APC tokens. At the listing price of $0.008, that turns into $57,125. But when APC reaches $0.1? That same $500 could explode to an eye-watering $714,063! Opportunities like this don’t come often, and once this phase sells out, the price moves up. History has shown that meme coin presales can create millionaire investors overnight, and Arctic Pablo Coin could be next. Floki Inu Expands Utility with New Development Floki Inu continues to solidify its presence in the crypto space with a recent strategic expansion.

The project’s latest updates hint at upcoming partnerships, which could drive even more attention and adoption in the coming months.

Floki Inu and Official Melania Meme are making strong moves, but the presale excitement surrounding APC is at an entirely different level.

41286502,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137925,1741362334,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Freed but Facing Trial: South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol’s Dramatic Release,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/yoon-suk-yeol-released-trial/,"In a stunning turn of events in South Korean politics, President Yoon Suk-yeol, who was previously detained under serious allegations, has been released. The Seoul Central District Court has overturned his detention, allowing him to face trial while not incarcerated. This development has ignited intense debate and speculation across the nation. What does this mean for South Korea’s political landscape and the future of President Yoon’s leadership? Let’s delve into the details of this unfolding saga. Yoon Suk-yeol Released: A Timeline of Events The saga of Yoon Suk-yeol Released from detention has been a whirlwind. To understand the current situation, it’s crucial to look back at the key milestones leading to his release: Initial Detention: President Yoon was detained on charges related to being the leader of an insurrection in connection with a martial law declaration. This detention sent shockwaves through South Korean society. Detention Overturn Plea: On February 4th, President Yoon’s legal team filed a plea to overturn his detention, arguing its unjust nature. Court Hearing: A crucial court hearing took place on February 20th at the Seoul Central District Court to consider the plea. Release Granted: On March 7th, the Seoul Central District Court accepted Yoon’s plea, deeming his detention unjust and ordering his release. Trial While Free: As a result of the court’s decision, President Yoon will now face trial while released, marking a significant shift in the legal proceedings. The Charges: Martial Law Declaration and Insurrection The gravity of the charges against President Yoon cannot be overstated. He is accused of leading an insurrection in connection with a Martial Law Declaration . Understanding these terms is key to grasping the severity of the situation: Martial Law: This is the temporary imposition of military rule over a civilian population, usually during a time of emergency or when civil authority has broken down. Declarations of martial law are extremely serious and carry significant legal and political ramifications. Insurrection: This refers to a violent uprising against an authority or government. Being accused of leading an insurrection is a charge of sedition and rebellion, carrying severe penalties. The specific details of the alleged insurrection and the proposed Martial Law Declaration remain under scrutiny and will be central to the upcoming trial. The prosecution will need to present compelling evidence to substantiate these serious charges. Political Detention South Korea: A Contentious Issue The detention of a sitting president is an extraordinary event, and the Political Detention South Korea has become a hot topic of debate. Critics of the detention argued that it was politically motivated, while proponents emphasized the importance of upholding the rule of law. Key points in this debate include: Rule of Law vs. Political Motivation: Was the detention a necessary step to ensure accountability, or was it an overreach driven by political opponents? This question lies at the heart of the controversy. Impact on Political Stability: Such high-profile detentions can destabilize the political landscape, raising concerns about democratic processes and the balance of power. Public Opinion: Public sentiment is deeply divided, with some supporting the legal process and others viewing it as a politically charged maneuver. The release of President Yoon does not negate these debates but rather shifts the focus to the fairness and impartiality of the upcoming trial. The Role of the Seoul Central District Court The Seoul Central District Court has played a pivotal role in this unfolding drama. Its decision to overturn the detention highlights the court’s independence and its critical function within the South Korean judicial system. Let’s examine its key actions: Action Date Significance Accepted plea to overturn detention March 7th Deemed detention unjust, ordered release Court Hearing on detention February 20th Considered arguments for and against detention Received plea to overturn detention February 4th Formal request from President Yoon’s legal team The court’s decision to release President Yoon indicates a careful consideration of the legal arguments presented and a commitment to due process. However, it’s crucial to remember that this is just one stage in a complex legal battle. What’s Next for the South Korean President Trial? With South Korean President Trial now set to proceed while Yoon is released, several crucial questions arise: Fair Trial Concerns: Can President Yoon receive a fair trial given the intense political atmosphere and public scrutiny? Ensuring impartiality will be paramount. Trial Duration and Process: High-profile trials can be lengthy and complex. The duration and specific legal processes will significantly impact the political landscape. Potential Outcomes: The trial’s outcome could range from acquittal to conviction, each with profound implications for President Yoon’s political future and South Korea’s stability. The world will be watching closely as the trial unfolds, seeking to understand the nuances of South Korean law and politics. Conclusion: A Nation Divided, A Trial to Watch The release of President Yoon Suk-yeol from detention marks a dramatic chapter in South Korean politics. While he is now free, the shadow of the impending trial looms large. The charges are serious, the political stakes are immense, and the nation remains divided. The coming months will be critical as the South Korean President Trial progresses, shaping not only Yoon’s destiny but also the future trajectory of South Korea itself. This is a story of power, law, and the delicate balance of democracy in action.

He pointed out that, following its 2016 hack, nearly half of the total BTC owned by the nation belongs to the Bitfinex exchange. Jiang proposed selling gold, reinvesting tariff revenues, and leveraging idle resources like federal data centers for Bitcoin mining as Bitcoin acquisition solutions. The upcoming White House Crypto Summit is expected to shape U.S. crypto policy, addressing regulations and CBDCs. On March 7, Jiang Jinze, analyst and founder of Muse Labs, responded to the U.S. government’s Bitcoin reserve strategy, which ruled out direct BTC purchases. He noted that selling gold to increase Bitcoin holdings, amongst other options, is now officially on the table. This method would be budget-neutral, meaning it wouldn’t require new funds, as the proceeds from gold sales could be used to acquire Bitcoin indirectly. Jiang Jinze Questions the U.S. Reliance on Bitcoin Forfeitures In a detailed X post, Jiang Jinze expressed concerns about the U.S. government’s decision to build its Bitcoin reserve solely on seized BTC from criminal and civil forfeiture cases. 预算中立的情况下可以增持比特币，意味着这些策略不可以增加政府预算的净支出，那卖黄金增持的可能性现在正式被摆上了台面，消息出炉后，黄金和比特币一起下跌。 以下是几种可能的财政中性策略： 1. 继续司法没收… https://t.co/MP0CYW3sJ4 — Jinze 金泽 (@kanazawa0x0) March 7, 2025 While Trump’s crypto Czar, David Sacks, noted that the U.S. government holds around 200,000 BTC, Jiang Jinze pointed out that only 100,000 BTC are true reserves. This is because nearly half of the confiscated Bitcoin must be returned to Bitfinex, the exchange that suffered a major hack in 2016. In that incident, hackers stole approximately 120,000 BTC, and after years of investigation, law enforcement recovered a substantial portion of the stolen funds. Since these Bitcoins rightfully belong to Bitfinex and its affected users, they are not part of the government’s actual reserves. ​​https://twitter.com/scottmelker/status/1897814636486877300 Additionally, he noted that most of the remaining confiscated Bitcoin was seized when its value was much lower, and acquiring such a large amount through future confiscations may take much longer. His perspective aligns with recent frustrations expressed by David Sacks over the Biden administration’s sell-off of 195,000 BTC for just $366 million, which would be worth over $17 billion today. Alternative Strategies for Expanding U.S. Bitcoin Reserves Jiang proposed three alternative strategies to expand the U.S. Bitcoin reserves without new fiscal expenditures. First, he suggested redistributing existing assets. He pointed out that the most viable source of incremental funds would be revenue generated from gold reserves or Federal Reserve deposits. The Fed’s earnings are turned over to the U.S. Treasury and categorized as general revenue, making them difficult to use for Bitcoin acquisition. As a result, selling gold appears to be the most realistic option. Other assets, such as land, buildings, and licenses, could also be liquidated, but the federal government’s holdings in these areas are limited and largely negligible. His second strategy involved reinvesting tariff revenues, allowing the government to buy Bitcoin without increasing spending. However, this option seems unlikely in the near term, as the Commerce Secretary has already ruled out using tariff income for the national crypto reserve plan. Finally, Jiang proposed using idle resources, such as federal data centers and underused energy sources, for Bitcoin mining. While he cited Bhutan’s state-supported mining as an example, he acknowledged that this approach would yield minimal returns, as 95% of Bitcoin has already been mined. Matrixport Reiterates Gold Selloff to Fund Bitcoin Reserves Adding to the discussion, Matrixport, Asia’s largest all-in-one crypto services hub, suggested that the U.S. government could tap into gold reserves to fund Bitcoin purchases under a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve plan. #MatrixOnTarget Report – Mar 7, 2025 How High Could Bitcoin Jump – If A Strategic BTC Reserve Starts Buying? #Matrixport #BTC #Crypto #CryptoFinance #CryptoMarketOverview #CryptoInvestors #WhiteHouse #Trump #StrategicBitcoinReserve pic.twitter.com/ndYzVnGhtx — Matrixport Official (@Matrixport_EN) March 7, 2025 U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis’ BITCOIN Act proposes using gold’s $688 billion market value to acquire 1 million BTC over five years, potentially by selling gold. Matrixport estimates that selling 15% of reserves could yield $110 billion, enough for 1.05 million BTC at current prices. JUST IN: Senator Cynthia Lummis says she wants Congress to give the Federal Reserve authority to own Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/WnCJ3FD7R4 — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) December 19, 2024 However, they cautioned that such a large-scale Bitcoin purchase would likely drive prices higher, making accumulation more expensive over time. The White House Crypto Summit and the Future of U.S. Bitcoin Policy Matrixport also projected that today’s White House Crypto Summit could shape U.S. crypto policy for the next four years. The summit is also expected to reaffirm the administration’s commitment to simplifying crypto regulations, opposing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and positioning the U.S. as a global blockchain leader. Despite this, many crypto investors and industry players have expressed disappointment with the announced Bitcoin reserve strategy, which triggered a sharp bearish trend for BTC . Spencer Hakimian, founder of New York-based Tolou Capital Management, called the plan underwhelming. At the same time, another crypto supporter noted that Trump’s pro-crypto campaign had suggested the government would actively accumulate Bitcoin over time. The promise was to BUY a certain number of BTC regularly over a period of time. How is this the same thing? All this is, is saying the government won’t sell seized BTC. That’s NOT what we were sold on. — bb (@SultanofStacks) March 7, 2025 The new approach, which prioritizes securing existing holdings rather than expanding them, has left some feeling it falls short of those expectations. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why is the U.S. government hesitant to buy Bitcoin directly? The U.S. government has ruled out direct Bitcoin purchases, likely due to regulatory, political, and fiscal concerns. Instead, it relies on seized assets, avoiding new spending or policy shifts that could spark controversy. Could returning Bitcoin to Bitfinex affect the government’s reserve strategy? Since nearly half of the estimated 200,000 BTC must be returned to Bitfinex, the government’s actual holdings are much smaller than perceived. This could weaken its long-term strategy and limit its ability to influence the market. What challenges would selling gold present to buying Bitcoin? Selling gold to fund Bitcoin acquisition could face resistance from policymakers and economists who see gold as a stable asset. Additionally, large-scale sales might impact gold prices and spark debates over asset diversification. How could the White House Crypto Summit change U.S. Bitcoin policy? The summit could set the stage for clearer regulations, influencing how the government approaches Bitcoin reserves in the future. It may also determine whether alternative strategies, such as mining or tariff reinvestment, gain traction.

Avalanche (AVAX) Gathers Momentum as Bulls Eye Higher Levels Avalanche (AVAX) is showing signs of strength in the current market. Trading within a range of $21.76 to $26.67, the price is holding above both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages, which are at $22.01 and $21.69 respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 56.52, indicating neutral to slightly bullish momentum. The MACD level is positive at 0.357, suggesting that the bulls might be gaining the upper hand. Over the past week, the price change is minimal at -0.44%, indicating stability after a sharper drop of -23.31% over the past month. Looking ahead, if the bulls maintain control, AVAX could test the nearest resistance level at $28.38. A successful breakout above this point might pave the way towards the second resistance level at $33.29, which would represent a significant increase from current levels. From $26.67 to $33.29 is approximately a 25% potential rise. Conversely, if bears regain strength, the nearest support level is at $18.56, with a second support at $13.65. However, with the positive indicators and an overall bullish sentiment in the altcoin market, AVAX has the potential to climb higher in the coming weeks. Chainlink Shows Strong Momentum Amid Bullish Signs Chainlink (LINK) is trading between $14.68 and $18.96. Over the past week, its price has risen by 12.70%, indicating bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 70.35, which suggests the asset is nearing overbought territory. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $17.09, surpassing the 100-day average of $15.56, signaling a positive trend. If the bulls continue to push, LINK could test the resistance level at $20. Breaking through this point might propel the price to the next resistance at $24, offering a substantial gain from current levels. This move would represent an increase of around 25%. On the downside, if bears gain control, the support level at $11.93 may come into play. Overall, technical indicators point toward potential growth in the near term. Polkadot (DOT) Shows Potential Amid Consolidation Phase Polkadot (DOT) is currently trading between $4.50 and $5.58. In the past week, the price has dipped by 4.62%, and over the last month, it’s down by 12.52%. However, over a six-month period, DOT has gained 14.65%. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are both around $4.56, indicating a period of consolidation. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 55.89, suggesting neutral market momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is positive at 0.0454, signaling potential upward movement. If DOT surpasses the nearest resistance level at $5.94, it could aim for the next resistance at $7.02, which is approximately a 40% increase from current prices. With the RSI below 60, there is room for the price to rise without entering overbought territory. These indicators align with the optimism for an upcoming altcoin season and potential crypto bull run. POL (ex-MATIC) Poised for a Potential Upswing POL (ex-MATIC) is currently trading between $0.26 and $0.33, showing signs of stabilization after recent declines. Over the past month, the price has decreased by 24.88%, but technical indicators suggest a possible shift. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 53.36, indicating neutral momentum. The Simple Moving Averages for both 10 and 100 days are aligned at $0.26, reflecting a consolidation phase around this level. The nearest resistance is at $0.35. Breaking above this could propel the price toward the second resistance at $0.41, representing an increase of over 20% from current levels. The MACD level of 0.001736 hints at building positive momentum, and the stochastic oscillator at 61.18 supports the potential for upward movement. With the nearest support levels at $0.23 and $0.16, traders are watching these key points closely. Many believe that an approaching altcoin season could fuel a broader market upswing, positioning POL for significant growth in the near future. Conclusion With the bull run here, AVAX, LINK, DOT, and POL are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out with its 20,000% growth target and blend of sports and memes.

The flagship cryptocurrency has been marginally down over the past 24 hours and trading around $89,500. BTC had dropped to a low of $84,718 earlier in the session before rebounding to its current levels. Markets tanked despite President Donald Trump signing an executive order to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. The crypto market cap is down 1% and currently sits at $2.90 trillion. Donald Trump Signs Executive Order To Establish Bitcoin Reserve US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to establish a strategic reserve of cryptocurrencies consisting of tokens owned by the government. However, markets were disappointed after expecting the government to announce a plan to buy new tokens. The announcement was made ahead of a meeting with crypto executives at the White House scheduled for Friday. White House AI and Crypto Szar David Sacks stated in a post on X, “A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will be capitalized with bitcoin owned by the federal government that was seized as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings.” The executive order kept open the possibility of buying BTC in the future, authorizing the US Commerce and Treasury Secretaries to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional Bitcoin, provided they do not impose an incremental cost on American taxpayers. Andrew O’Neill, Digital Assets Managing Director at S&P Global Ratings called the executive order “mainly symbolic,” adding it is the first time BTC is formally recognized as a reserve asset. “The significance of this executive order is mainly symbolic, as it marks the first time Bitcoin is formally recognized as a reserve asset of the United States government. The reserve will only include Bitcoin already owned by the US government. There is no indication yet of how much, if any, would be acquired, nor a timeline. Markets Left Unimpressed Donald Trump’s executive order establishing a Bitcoin strategic reserve failed to impress markets, with BTC and other altcoins declining following the announcement. BTC fell over 5% following the announcement and is struggling to reclaim $90,000 as volatility hits the market and investor sentiment. The US government owns around 200,000 BTC seized during various criminal and civil proceedings. Trump’s promise to create a strategic reserve and friendlier regulations propelled BTC past $100,000 and reached a new all-time high. However, many in the community felt let down by the final outcome. Charles Edwards, founder of Bitcoin-focused hedge fund Capriole Investments, did not mince words, stating, “This is the most underwhelming and disappointing outcome we could have expected for this week. No active buying means this is just a fancy title for Bitcoin holdings that already existed with the Govt. This is a pig in lipstick.” All Eyes On Crypto Summit Market watchers have turned their attention to Friday’s White House Crypto Summit, with Trump expected to use the platform to formally announce his plans. However, it is unclear how the reserve would work or benefit taxpayers. According to Sacks, the federal government has a strategy to maximize the value of its Bitcoin holdings held in the reserve. However, he did not offer any further details. Sacks stated, “The U.S. will not sell any bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called 'digital gold.” Trump’s attempts to woo the crypto industry, which spent millions on his campaign, have drawn concern from some conservative quarters and crypto backers over giveaways to a hugely wealthy and influential community. Is A Rally On The Cards? BTC registered a rapid decline last week as it plunged below $80,000 on Friday before recovering to reclaim lost ground. While price action remains volatile, indicators suggest the flagship cryptocurrency is entering a crucial phase in its trajectory. One analyst pointed to the “fear and greed” index, which has historically helped identify when Bitcoin is in the early stages of a bull run or when excessive optimism could lead to a correction. According to the analyst, Bitcoin has entered the “Optimism Stage,” historically associated with the early stages of a strong rally. When Bitcoin reached these levels in the past, it has almost always gained momentum and led to further price increases. However, the analyst warned that if the index continues rising, it could enter the “Euphoria” stage, indicating excessive market optimism and a steep correction. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis BTC has faced considerable volatility over the past few sessions as it struggles to establish a foothold above $90,000. BTC traded in the red for most of last week, starting with a substantial decline of 4.65% on Monday. The price fell below $90,000 on Tuesday and declined to $84,129 on Wednesday as selling pressure intensified. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Thursday, reaching an intraday high of $87,045 before settling at $84,656, ultimately registering a marginal increase. BTC plunged below $80,000 on Friday on its way to an intraday low of $78,173. However, it recovered from this level to reclaim $80,000 and settle at $84,362, ultimately registering a marginal decline.

This directive, issued by India’s Ministry of Finance on February 14, 2025, comes months after WazirX suffered a massive ₹2000 crore hack, putting over ₹4500 crore in user funds at risk. Breaking NEWS : India’s Finance Ministry Orders FIU Investigation into WazirX for Fraud! pic.twitter.com/ZUIBAUEVII — Pushpendra Singh (@pushpendrakum) March 7, 2025 Government Cracks Down on Crypto Irregularities The investigation follows a formal complaint filed with the Finance Ministry, prompting Shri Kailash Chand Joshi, Under Secretary (Legal), to escalate the matter. Official documents now task the FIU with uncovering the full extent of WazirX’s alleged fraudulent activities. This move signals stricter enforcement in India’s crypto sector as regulators aim to clamp down on financial misconduct and safeguard investor interests. The hack resulted in significant losses for investors, and nearly 43% of users are likely to lose their funds, with investigations revealing complex hacking techniques and possible internal vulnerabilities. WazirX has been cooperating with authorities but has not yet provided a clear resolution for affected users. Money Laundering Allegations and Binance Connection However, authorities have raised serious concerns over WazirX’s compliance failures. Reports suggest the platform may have facilitated money laundering for fintech firms by failing to enforce proper KYC (Know Your Customer) checks and neglecting to maintain bank account records. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) previously criticized WazirX for weak transaction controls, particularly in dealings with Binance. Adding to its troubles, the exchange’s massive security breach in July 2024—linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group—exposed significant flaws in its operational safeguards. Investigations revealed discrepancies in transaction data and inadequate wallet security, further raising doubts about the platform’s integrity. Will WazirX Executives Face Legal Consequences? With mounting evidence, speculation is growing that WazirX co-founder Nischal Shetty and key associates could face criminal charges. If the FIU’s probe confirms financial misconduct, severe legal repercussions, including potential jail time, could follow. This case is poised to become a landmark moment in India’s crypto regulation. If wrongdoing is proved, it could lead to stricter rules, tighter oversight, and heightened accountability for exchanges operating in the country.

Trump made good on one of his pro-crypto promises and signed an executive order that will make it mandatory for the country to at least maintain its BTC stash. Yet, bitcoin prices are yet to feel the actual impact. But before going into details on that order signed on Thursday, let’s go back to the developments that unfolded during the weekend. After a calm few days following BTC’s latest rollercoaster, the asset had remained at around $85,000 before, on Sunday evening, Trump posted on his social media that there are indeed plans to establish a US-based crypto reserve that will hold some altcoins and bitcoin. Prices exploded within minutes. BTC skyrocketed from its aforementioned level by ten grand and tapped a multi-day peak of $95,000. However, that turned out to be a fakeout as some analysts warned and the cryptocurrency dumped by $13,000 in the next 36 hours to under $82,000 on Tuesday. Its correction didn’t continue in the following days. Just the opposite, bitcoin started to recover some ground and knocked on the $90,000 door on a couple of occasions but to no avail. The first rejection came on Thursday, but the second big one on Friday morning pushed BTC south hard to $85,000 once again. Interestingly, this one came just minutes after Trump signed the executive order to halt the sales of bitcoin from the US government, which owns close to 190,000 BTC (valued at over $17 billion). This classic sell-the-news event sent bitcoin south, but the asset jumped to $91,000 just a few hours ago. However, another rejection arrived at this point, and BTC now struggles beneath $90,000. The day is far from over, though, given the upcoming crypto summit to be held at the White House. Consequently, more volatility is expected. The weekly landscape is quite positive for BTC and many altcoins, but that’s mostly because the entire market plummeted last Friday once again. On a monthly scale, the situation is different, with most assets deep in the red.

The second-largest cryptocurrency continues to underperform and was close to breaking below $2,000 earlier this week. Naturally, the sentiment toward ETH has gone south hard, but could this actually be a blessing in disguise ? Declining Dollar Index Could be a Tailwind For Crypto: Analysts . The greenback has lost a big portion of its value compared to other currencies. Moreover, analysts claim that Trump plans to devalue it further. Interestingly, a weak dollar could mean higher prices for bitcoin and altcoins, and here’s why . Bukele Defies IMF, Reaffirms Bitcoin Commitment Despite Loan Restrictions . El Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele got a loan deal from the IMF several months ago, and parts of that agreement mandated that the country reduce its Bitcoin involvement. However, Bukele refused to stop the BTC investments and outlined a bullish perspective earlier this week. XRP, SOL, and ADA Inclusion in US Crypto Reserve Pushes Traders on Edge . As mentioned above, Trump named several altcoins that could potentially be included in the US strategic crypto reserve. Expectedly, their prices soared by double-digits immediately after the Sunday post, which led to a large number of liquidated traders on both sides, given the fact that these alts retraced hard just a day later. Why Arthur Hayes Is Bullish on Bitcoin Under Trump’s Economic Strategy . The BitMEX co-founder has been a vocal critic of the Bitcoin reserve in the States. He believes it will ultimately serve the purpose of whoever is in charge, disregarding the entire crypto market. In a more recent post, though, Hayes stated that the Trump administration’s actions will be bullish for BTC. Bybit Hacker Reportedly Launders Entire $1.4B Loot in Just 10 Days . The Bybit hacker, largely believed to be the North Korea-backed Lazarus Group, needed less than two weeks to launder the entire stolen amount, which was worth around $1.4 billion at the time of the incident.

Imagine a world where your online identity is not only verified but also empowers you within the decentralized ecosystem. That future is edging closer as Pundi AI , a leading decentralized AI data annotation platform, has just announced a groundbreaking partnership with Twin3 AI , a pioneering digital identity management project. This collaboration is set to redefine how we perceive and utilize digital identity in the age of artificial intelligence. Why Digital Identity is the Cornerstone of Web3’s Future Before diving into the specifics of this exciting partnership, let’s understand why digital identity is such a hot topic and a critical component for the future of Web3. In the traditional web, our identities are often siloed and controlled by centralized entities. Web3, with its promise of decentralization and user empowerment, demands a different approach. Here’s why digital identity is crucial: Security and Trust: In a decentralized world, establishing trust is essential. Digital identities provide a secure and verifiable way to confirm users are who they claim to be, reducing fraud and enhancing security. Seamless User Experience: Imagine accessing various decentralized applications (dApps) without repeatedly going through cumbersome KYC (Know Your Customer) processes. Digital identities can streamline user onboarding and create a more fluid experience across different platforms. Data Ownership and Control: Web3 is about giving users control over their data. Digital identity solutions can empower individuals to manage their personal information and decide who has access to it. Compliance and Regulation: As the crypto space matures, regulatory compliance becomes increasingly important. Digital identities can facilitate adherence to KYC/AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations in a decentralized manner. In essence, digital identity acts as the bedrock upon which a secure, user-friendly, and compliant Web3 ecosystem can be built. Now, let’s explore how Pundi AI and Twin3 AI are joining forces to make this vision a reality. Pundi AI and Twin3 AI: A Synergistic Alliance for AI Authentication The partnership between Pundi AI and Twin3 AI is more than just a collaboration; it’s a strategic alignment of two innovative forces in the decentralized space. Pundi AI brings to the table its expertise in decentralized AI data annotation , creating high-quality datasets crucial for training robust AI models. Twin3 AI, on the other hand, specializes in digital identity management, leveraging blockchain technology to create secure and user-centric identity solutions.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Discover how BlockDAG’s global hackathons could drive BDAG growth, why BNB price forecasts suggest a push to $700, and HBAR’s path to $0.40. Table of Contents BlockDAG hackathons could drive BDAG’s growth Binance Coin price forecast: Can BNB rebound? Can HBAR maintain its rally above $0.23? Summing up Binance Coin (BNB) is showing signs of recovery despite market volatility, with analysts projecting a possible climb to over $4,600 by 2031. Hedera’s recent 10% rally, driven by SWIFT’s adoption of its blockchain, has strengthened its market position, with traders eyeing $0.40 as the next target. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is taking a different approach by launching four global hackathons through its partnership with HackerEarth. These hackathons are more than coding events — they’re a chance to be part of a top crypto to buy before its ecosystem surges with over 200 new dApps. As developers flood in, BDAG’s utility and demand could rise, potentially positioning early holders for strong gains as BlockDAG’s ecosystem grows. BlockDAG hackathons could drive BDAG’s growth BlockDAG’s upcoming hackathons are more than coding events — they’re the foundation for a thriving ecosystem. Through its partnership with HackerEarth, BlockDAG plans to host four global hackathons in 2025, attracting 10,000 to 15,000 developers. These events are expected to generate over 200 decentralized applications (dApps) on the network, fueling demand for BDAG coins as developers, users, and projects utilize them for transactions, gas fees, and network activities. With this initiative, BlockDAG aims to establish itself as a top crypto to buy, offering real utility and potential growth. The hackathons will play a crucial role in building new dApps that could capture mainstream attention and bring fresh waves of users to the network. As more projects launch, the BlockDAG ecosystem could see increased adoption, driving up the value of BDAG coins. Early holders could benefit significantly, as the expanding use cases for BDAG may lead to a steady rise in its market performance. Those looking for the next top crypto to buy might find BlockDAG an attractive option. Currently, BlockDAG’s presale has raised over $201 million, with 18.6 billion BDAG coins sold at $0.0248 per coin. The presale’s 2,380% return reflects strong interest, and with plans to list on 10 major crypto exchanges, BlockDAG offers a promising opportunity for those seeking long-term gains.

The Binance Coin price forecast shows a mixed outlook after the departure of Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. BNB is currently trading at around $597, struggling to break the $635 resistance level. Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, with the 50-day SMA at $647.02 and the 200-day SMA at $623.79. The RSI at 42.32 points to selling pressure, keeping traders cautious. Despite short-term challenges, analysts remain optimistic about the BNB price for the coming years. BNB’s utility within the Binance ecosystem and its deflationary model, driven by Binance’s buyback and burn strategy, support long-term growth potential. Projections for 2025 see BNB reaching up to $1,064.36, with a potential climb to $4,612.24 by 2031. As Binance continues to expand its DeFi solutions, BNB could see renewed interest and stronger price performance. Can HBAR maintain its rally above $0.23? The Hedera price forecast has turned bullish following a 10% rally that pushed HBAR from $0.2332 to $0.262. This surge came after SWIFT, the global cross-border payment network, announced plans to implement Hedera’s blockchain in North America, Europe, and Asia. With SWIFT processing over $150 trillion annually, this partnership could significantly boost institutional adoption of the Hedera network. Analysts believe HBAR’s ability to hold above the critical $0.23 support level is key to sustaining its momentum. A strong breakout above this mark will suggest that sellers are losing control, with buyers stepping in confidently. If this support holds, the Hedera price forecast indicates potential gains toward the $0.40 range. However, a drop below $0.23 could signal a false breakout and slow the bullish momentum, making this a crucial level to watch. Summing up The Binance Coin price forecast points to long-term potential, with analysts eyeing a rise to $4,612.24 by 2031. Meanwhile, the Hedera price forecast highlights a bullish trend, with HBAR aiming to maintain support above $0.23 and possibly push towards $0.40. BlockDAG offers a different kind of opportunity. With its upcoming hackathons expected to create over 200 dApps, BlockDAG is setting the stage for strong growth. The surge in developer activity could increase the utility of BDAG coins, driving demand and potentially boosting market performance. Those looking for the top crypto to buy might find BlockDAG’s current presale, with a 2,380% ROI and plans to list on 10 major exchanges, an exciting chance to get in early.

To read full editions, subscribe . To end the first week of March, let’s look back at venture capital activity in February, shall we? Perhaps we can sum it up to a shorter month, but overall venture capital funding in February was down slightly from January, though the number of companies raising was up marginally. Last month, $1.11 billion was raised by 137 companies, though we saw $1.57 billion go to 132 companies to kick the year off, per TIE Terminal data. DeFi paved the way last month, with 20 companies raising around $175 million. Perhaps that’s a sign of a trend of where money’s going, because DeFi also led deals in January, with 21 companies raising $339 million. But it’s not just DeFi receiving the attention. There were notable raises from a couple of other firms, including Bitwise, which raised $70 million through an equity raise in a round led by Electric Capital. And Raise, the gift card company looking to use its $63 million round to beef up its blockchain-based gift card offerings. I don’t choose favorites when it comes to VC rounds, but this one certainly caught my eye when it was announced late last month. When comparing the raises (not just the gift card company) to January, the rounds are smaller. Phantom and Movement Labs both had rounds of $150 million and $100 million , respectively. Source: The TIE Terminal When looking at the deal sizes so far this year, there is a noticeable drop. I’m cautious to read too much into it yet, given the overall bullish environment and the fact that I’ve had plenty of conversations with VCs in which they affirm that they’re pretty active, but this is the trend we’re currently looking at. Source: TIE As you can see, the number of larger deals seems to have peaked in December of last year, though we’re still seeing deals above $50 million — take Raise and Bitwise, for example. The average deal size, if we’re looking this week, sits at $9 million. On the last day of February, it was slightly higher at $10 million. We’re only two months into the year, so I’m cautious to call any of this data a trend yet, and we’re still a ways off from the peak of crypto VC activity, which topped $23 billion in 2022 . But consider my interest piqued, especially because PitchBook’s Robert Le told us last year that he expected more of a bull market in 2025. Bring it on. Get the news in your inbox.

The acquisition, made through a convertible note issuance with a conversion price of $12.50 per share — more than double FLD’s March 5 closing price — places Fold among the top 10 U.S. public companies with the largest Bitcoin ( BTC ) treasuries. This means that Fold’s Bitcoin holdings are currently worth over $135 million.

Fold officially went public on the Nasdaq under the ticker “FLD” in February, increasing its visibility and allowing investors to engage with its bitcoin-focused vision. Nasdaq plans to introduce 24/5 trading, allowing investors to trade stocks continuously from Sunday evening to Friday night. At the time of writing, Fold’s stock is trading at $8.18 per share.

The current second phase presale of MUTM has now collected $2.3 million from 4,300 token holders. Mutuum Finance plans to launch at $0.06 following its token listing while expert analysts project the token value to reach $5 in ten to twelve months. The market analysts predict Mutuum Finance will emerge as a better investment choice than Solana (SOL) because it offers practical value and robust earning potential. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has achieved exceptional success during its presale event. The first phase tickets sold out quickly and the second phase of tokens is active at a price of $0.015. Future Mutuum Finance investors will benefit predominantly from this upcoming price increase of $0.02 during the next phase which generates a 33% value appreciation from present token rates. The structured pricing model provides maximum profit potential to early entrants through its established pricing sequence which delivers a value return of 4x based on the initial value launch at $0.06. The core elements of Mutuum Finance’s achievement exist beyond price increases because it offers distinct advantages to its users. MUTM differs from most speculative tokens because its developers created it to enable users to benefit from decentralized lending and borrowing features. The functional nature of MUTM and its utilization by investors has increased demand while accelerating the progress of the presale phase. An innovative mtTokens system stands as the main attractiveness factor of Mutuum Finance. Users earning ETH or DAI can get their assets in equivalent mtETH or mtDAI form through the system. The tokens generate interest automatically so users collect passive earnings as their liquidity remains unaffected. MtTokens offer transferability to other DeFi platforms as well as functionality across multiple DeFi platforms which increases their market demand. The platform maintains a distribution and buying system that utilizes part of its earnings to purchase MUTM tokens on the market and redistribute them to mtToken stakeholders. The distributed tokens supplied to mtToken stakers establish continuous purchasing demand that stimulates investors to maintain a long-time holding strategy. As a result this system enables both short-term traders and long-term investors to find MUTM attractive because it combines stable prices with continuous growth potential. A Competitive Edge in the Crypto Market The cryptocurrency market leader Solana (SOL) competes with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because MUTM specialized in decentralized lending and borrowing solutions. Solana achieves popularity with developers because of its fast processing framework while MUTM positions itself differently through real-world financial integration and its built-in token economy structure. Mutuum Finance establishes financial stability through its borrowing system which demands property worth higher than loan amounts from contributors. Security and efficiency are strengthened in the system because lenders preserve their assets from being defaulted through the established overcollateralized mechanism. The platform provides a peer-to-peer (P2P) lending feature that lets users negotiate terms independently thus extending its flexibility to attract users. The Road Ahead for Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance enters the market following successful pre-sale performances alongside a rising number of investors that positions it for solid future performance. Experts predict that the $0.06 listing price offers only a glimpse into Mutuum Finance’s potential since they see much more growth ahead. The next year brings expected price elevation to $5 based on market predictions showing strong potential growth for the platform. In addition to its $100,000 giveaway Mutuum Finance distributes $10,000 prizes to their early supporters. The initiative has increased project interest because it brought additional investors and strengthened confidence about its future growth potential. Join the Mutuum Finance presale now and secure your MUTM tokens at $0.015 before the price increases in the next phase.

Trump reportedly instructed Cabinet members and DOGE to team up and work on spending and workforce reductions. However, he clarified that final job cuts will happen at the discretion of the department leaders. President Trump’s new mandate regarding DOGE “We just had a meeting with most of the Secretaries, Elon, and others, and it was a very positive one,” Trump shared on Truth Social. “It’s very important that we cut levels down to where they should be, but it’s also important to keep the best and most productive people.” President Donald Trump’s Truth Social post explaining how Elon Musk’s DOGE and Cabinet members can work together to manage federal government costs. Source: Donald Trump (Truth Social) Trump implied that secretaries will genuinely work to understand people working in various departments and will use their knowledge to decide who goes and who stays. “We say the ‘scalpel’ rather than the ‘hatchet,'” Trump said. The message is the first time Trump has publicly put a leash on Musk’s authority as he continues to help reshape the federal government. Some even see it as early signs of dissent between DOGE and the Cabinet members. Several members of the Cabinet were unhappy with Musk’s recent order, which asked federal employees to outline their achievements for the week or face termination, with multiple agencies and departments initially resisting the effort. While the new message implies some excesses on Musk’s end, Trump also praised him and DOGE after Thursday’s meeting for what they have gotten done so far. “I think they’ve done an amazing job,” the president told reporters. Musk also tagged the meeting a “very productive” one in a post on X. It marks his second time attending a Trump Cabinet meeting. At the first cabinet meeting he attended last month, Musk called DOGE a “support function” to help the federal agencies “find a 15% reduction in fraud and waste.” In recent weeks, DOGE has faced significant backlash, especially from federal workers, unions, and progressive groups, people who have been affected by its actions. All the confusion has been building up to a chaotic conclusion, which is probably why the president has decided to step in with a leash for the agency. Musk still has a huge role to play According to Trump’s comments to reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday, his directive to his Cabinet members was to “Keep all the people you want, all the people that you need.” It was most likely a move to appease his aggrieved Cabinet members, who have increasingly been clashing with DOGE over several interests, most especially employment. The order reduces Musk’s power, but he can still do a lot. Trump has indicated that Musk will step in if the department heads fail to make sufficient cuts. “If they can cut, it’s better. If they don’t cut, then Elon will do the cutting,” Trump said. Trump and Musk have been trying to drastically reduce the size of the federal workforce, which has led to the dismissal of thousands of employees and the shuttering of entire agencies. Senate DOGE Caucus pose for a photo with Elon Musk. Source: Elon Musk (X/Twitter) As earlier stated, the speed and intensity with which the cuts have been happening has not sat well with some Republican members of Congress, and it has sparked calls for greater transparency into DOGE’s work, particularly after some lawmakers faced fierce backlash from people at town halls in their districts. So, on top of the Herculean task of cleaning up government excesses, DOGE has to also pacify crowds the whole way. Musk even had to meet with Senate Republicans for nearly two hours behind closed doors on Wednesday to address their concerns over potential voter backlash to the cuts. The meeting was organized by Sen. Rick Scott after several Republican senators raised concerns with White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles last month about being kept out of the loop on DOGE’s work. Musk also met with House Republicans on Wednesday, later informing reporters that he spoke about the “opportunity to improve expenditures in the government.” Is DOGE actually working? It depends on who you ask. To date, sentiments regarding the newly created agency are mixed. According to one CBS News/YouGov poll conducted between February 26 and February 28, 2025, only slim majorities support Musk’s involvement and efforts to shrink the federal workforce. Earlier this month, Musk revealed that DOGE has a very high “approval” from people as a whole, a fact he contrasted with the criticism he was getting. These majorities consist mostly of Republicans and fans of Musk and Trump, many of whom see government spending as excessive. DOGE now says it has saved $105 billion so far, and while it has been a challenge to verify this figure, the agency’s supporters still praise it for its work. It has been difficult to verify that DOGE is actually doing what it says it’s doing, and this has added to the backlash. It does not help matters that DOGE’s “wall of receipts” website, which was meant to showcase savings, has been full of errors.

This bold proposition, voiced via a statement on X, signals a potential shift towards integrating Bitcoin into the national economic strategy, urging collaboration between the Trump administration and Congress. But what exactly does this mean for the future of crypto in the US and globally? Let’s dive into the details and explore the implications of this exciting development. Why a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? Understanding French Hill’s Vision French Hill, Chairman of the influential House Financial Services Committee, isn’t just throwing out ideas; he’s strategically positioning Bitcoin as a crucial asset for the nation’s future. His call for a strategic Bitcoin reserve isn’t a mere endorsement of cryptocurrency; it’s a calculated suggestion to leverage Bitcoin’s unique properties for national benefit. Think of it like this: just as nations maintain reserves of gold or oil for economic stability and security, Congressman Hill envisions Bitcoin playing a similar, yet digitally native, role. To fully grasp the significance, let’s break down the potential rationale behind this proposal: Economic Diversification: A strategic Bitcoin reserve could diversify the US’s treasury holdings, reducing reliance on traditional assets and potentially mitigating risks associated with inflation or economic downturns. Technological Leadership: Embracing Bitcoin as a reserve asset would position the US as a leader in the digital asset space, fostering innovation and attracting investment in blockchain technology.

Challenges and Considerations for a Bitcoin Reserve While the idea of a strategic Bitcoin reserve is compelling, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that need to be addressed. Implementing such a policy is not without its hurdles: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility is a significant concern. Fluctuations in value could create accounting and risk management complexities for a national reserve. Robust strategies for managing this volatility would be essential. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Clear and consistent regulations are needed to provide a stable framework for managing a strategic Bitcoin reserve and ensuring compliance. Security and Custody: Securely storing and managing a large Bitcoin reserve is paramount. Robust custody solutions and cybersecurity measures are necessary to prevent theft or loss. Public Perception and Education: Public understanding and acceptance of Bitcoin are still developing. Educating the public and policymakers about the benefits and risks of a strategic Bitcoin reserve is crucial for gaining broader support. Energy Consumption Concerns: Bitcoin mining’s energy consumption has been a point of criticism. Addressing these environmental concerns, perhaps through investments in renewable energy for mining or exploring more energy-efficient consensus mechanisms, would be important for long-term sustainability. The Trump Administration and Crypto: A Potential Turning Point? French Hill’s appeal to the Trump administration is particularly noteworthy given the evolving political landscape surrounding cryptocurrency. While the previous administration’s stance on crypto was sometimes perceived as cautious, there are indications of a potential shift. Encouraging the Trump administration to work with Congress on a strategic Bitcoin reserve could signify a more proactive and potentially positive approach to digital assets. Here are some key questions to consider regarding the Trump administration’s potential role: Will the Trump administration embrace a pro-crypto stance? Recent rhetoric and appointments suggest a potentially more favorable view of digital assets compared to previous years. How will regulatory agencies respond? Collaboration between the administration, Congress, and regulatory bodies like the SEC and CFTC will be crucial for establishing a clear and supportive regulatory framework for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. What impact will this have on global crypto policy? A US move towards a strategic Bitcoin reserve could influence other nations to reconsider their crypto policies, potentially leading to wider global adoption. Navigating Crypto Regulation: A Balanced Approach The discussion around a strategic Bitcoin reserve underscores the broader need for clear and effective crypto regulation . It’s not just about reserves; it’s about creating a regulatory environment that fosters innovation while protecting consumers and mitigating risks. A balanced approach to crypto regulation is essential for unlocking the full potential of digital assets. Key aspects of effective crypto regulation include: Clarity and Certainty: Regulations should provide clear guidelines for crypto businesses, reducing ambiguity and fostering compliance. Innovation-Friendly Frameworks: Regulations should be designed to encourage innovation and growth in the crypto space, rather than stifling it. Consumer Protection: Safeguarding consumers from fraud and illicit activities is paramount. Regulations should include measures to protect investors and users of crypto platforms. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and KYC Compliance: Robust AML and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations are necessary to prevent the use of cryptocurrencies for illegal purposes. International Cooperation: Given the global nature of cryptocurrencies, international cooperation and harmonization of regulations are crucial for effective oversight. Conclusion: A Revolutionary Step Towards Digital Asset Integration? French Hill’s call for a strategic Bitcoin reserve is more than just a suggestion; it’s a bold vision for integrating digital assets into the core of the US financial strategy. While challenges exist, the potential benefits – from economic diversification and technological leadership to enhanced financial sovereignty – are significant. As the Trump administration and Congress consider this revolutionary proposal, the world watches with anticipation. Will the US embrace this opportunity to lead the way in the digital asset era? The answer could reshape the future of finance and solidify Bitcoin’s place in the global economic landscape.

However, the current market sentiment remains bearish, with top assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP also experiencing notable price declines. This downturn is potentially influencing overall market sentiment. Chainlink (LINK) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, LINK appears to be forming a bearish double-top pattern on the four-hour timeframe. While this pattern is yet to be complete, the chart also shows a bearish divergence, further supporting this negative outlook. Based on historical price momentum, if the asset closes below the $16.15 level, there is a strong possibility of a 22% decline, bringing it down to $12.75 in the coming days. A bearish divergence occurs when the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the double-top pattern align, specifically when the pattern’s tops are parallel while the RSI’s tops decline. Source: Trading View Current Price Momentum Following the formation of the pattern, the asset has begun moving downward. LINK is currently trading near $16.31 and has dropped 4.5% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, its trading volume has surged by 12%, indicating increased participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Traders Lean Bearish With the ongoing price decline and bearish price action, intraday traders seem to be following the current market sentiment, strongly betting on the bearish side, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data reveals that traders are currently over-leveraged, with key levels at $16 on the lower side and $17.50 on the upper side for both bulls and bears.

Meanwhile, Panshibi (SHIBI) is stealing the spotlight in the meme coin space, with early hype suggesting it could be one of 2025’s biggest viral crypto sensations. So what features are drawing investors to these two projects? Cardano Price Prediction: Could ADA Break Into The Top 4? Cardano (ADA) is starting to turn heads, with some analysts predicting it could break into the top four cryptos by market cap this year. With strong on-chain activity, major partnerships, and a bullish price forecast, ADA might just be gearing up for a big move. But what’s really fueling this momentum? Right now, Cardano is trading at $0.914, and analysts are calling for a potential rally up to $2.24 in 2025—more than a 140% increase from where it’s at now. So why are analysts so bullish about the Cardano price prediction? One of the biggest catalysts for ADA is its new partnership with Walmart. Through a cashback program, shoppers can now earn ADA rewards when making everyday purchases using the YoroiWallet. This gives Cardano real-world exposure, something many cryptos struggle with. If mainstream adoption takes off, Cardano's demand could explode. On-chain stats also paint a bullish picture. Cardano’s network has processed over 91 million transactions, averaging 50,000–70,000 per day. With more developers building dApps and smart contracts, the ecosystem is expanding at a rapid pace, spiking the native token’s value. Panshibi: The Meme Coin Taking Over 2025 Panshibi (SHIBI) is quickly rising to dominance as it takes over the meme coin market. Investors are drawn to its modern combination of real-world impact, tangible utility for investors, and the best elements of meme coin culture. What sets Panshibi apart is its focus on rewarding holders and ensuring a sustainable ecosystem. Unlike other meme coins that rely solely on speculation, Panshibi offers high-yield staking, with returns reaching up to 1,200% APY. This means investors don’t just have to wait for price appreciation; they can actively earn from their holdings. Beyond financial incentives, Panshibi’s Social-Fi integration keeps its community engaged. Holders can compete in interactive challenges, earn rewards, and gain access to the exclusive Bamboo Private VIP Members Club. These features create an ecosystem that goes beyond the usual pump-and-dump meme coin model, fostering long-term participation. Security is also a major focus. Panshibi has passed a full audit from blockchain security firm Coinsult, ensuring its smart contract is free from vulnerabilities. Liquidity is locked for 10 years, and team tokens are secured for two years, providing long-term confidence for investors. And while meme coins are often seen as pure speculation, Panshibi is also making a real-world impact by allocating funds toward panda conservation efforts. This unique angle not only strengthens its branding but also adds a layer of social responsibility that most meme projects lack. SHIBI Frenzy: Investors Move Fast to Lock in Their Tokens With the presale now surpassing $1.22 million, investors are flocking to the Panshibi presale to grab their share of the coveted SHIBI tokens. With tokens up for grabs for just $0.005 in stage 4, now is an opportune moment to get in early on a market disruptor. Analysts have anticipated a 1,200% increase before the preale’s conclusion, with more growth expected post-launch. With plans for major exchange listings, a strong community-driven roadmap, and an engaged investor base, Panshibi is proving itself to be a top-tier meme coin contender for 2025.

Deaton has shared his views on former President Donald Trump’s executive order (EO) regarding a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). The EO has sparked debate among cryptocurrency investors and traders, as it confirms that the reserve will only contain Bitcoin obtained through legal forfeitures rather than government purchases. Pro XRP Lawyer John Deaton Comments on Strategic Bitcoin Reserve In an X post responding to investor Scott Melker, Pro-XRP lawyer John E. Deaton acknowledged concerns within the crypto community regarding the EO. While some traders expected the U.S. government to actively buy Bitcoin and other digital assets, Deaton emphasized that the EO is as aggressive as a president can be without emergency powers. The pro-XRP lawyer explained that the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) grants the U.S. Treasury Secretary broad authority to hold financial assets to stabilize markets. However, he noted that any direct government Bitcoin purchase could face legal challenges. Deaton stated, “I’m not suggesting that Secretary Bessent will be buying BTC tomorrow, because, no doubt, it would be challenged in Court.” Pro-XRP lawyer John E. Deaton also pointed out that more extreme actions, such as invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) or the Defense Production Act, would be unrealistic. Crypto Market Reaction to the Executive Order Following the yesterday’s announcement, cryptocurrency prices experienced a decline. Bitcoin price fell as much as 6.6% before rebounding slightly to around $89,000. Other digital assets, including Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, and XRP, also recorded losses. Investors had anticipated that the U.S. government might purchase Bitcoin, leading to increased demand. Trump’s earlier social media post suggested that various cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, and Solana, could be part of a strategic reserve. However, the EO clarified that the government would not acquire additional assets beyond those seized by law enforcement. The executive order also introduced a separate national digital assets stockpile for non-Bitcoin tokens. However, the White House did not specify which cryptocurrencies would be included or how they would be managed. Bitcoin’s Role in U.S. Financial Strategy Supporters of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve argue that Bitcoin serves as a valuable asset similar to gold. Some believe that holding Bitcoin could provide financial stability and act as a hedge against inflation. White House advisor David Sacks referred to the reserve as a “digital Fort Knox,” reinforcing the idea that the government sees Bitcoin as a store of value rather than an active investment. Sacks estimated that the U.S. holds around 200,000 Bitcoins, worth approximately $17.8 billion. He assured transparency regarding the government’s digital asset holdings and stated that the U.S. would not sell its Bitcoin from the reserve. Despite this, financial analysts view the move as largely symbolic, as there is no clear plan to expand the holdings through new acquisitions. Implications for Crypto Regulation and Global Adoption Industry experts believe that the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve reduces the likelihood of a U.S. government crackdown on Bitcoin. Matt Hougan, the Bitwise CIO, noted that the move could encourage other nations to create similar reserves. “The U.S. will not ban Bitcoin. This increases the likelihood that other nations will follow suit,” Hougan posted on X. He added that the decision could accelerate global Bitcoin adoption and make it harder for institutions to argue against holding digital assets. Moreover, with the White House hosting major crypto industry leaders , including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, discussions on digital asset policies are expected to continue. While the EO may not have met all investor expectations, it signals a shift in the U.S. government’s approach to Bitcoin and digital assets.

Jito ( JTO ), the biggest liquid staking and restaking network on Solana, was trading at $2.5, bringing its market cap to $787 million. Third-party data shows that Jito has become the third most profitable players in the crypto industry after Tether and Tron ( TRX ). It has made $411 million this year, making it more profitable than popular chains like Solana ( SOL ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). Jito, which has $2.34 billion in assets, is even more profitable than Lido, the biggest liquid staking player in crypto, which has over $20 billion in assets. The token has likely underperformed because of its tokenomics. It has a maximum supply of 999.9 million tokens against a circulating supply of 301 million. It then unlocks 11.31 million JTO tokens each month, a process that will continue until December 2026. You might also like: Here’s why crypto prices may crash after the Trump summit Token unlocks are usually bearish since they introduce new tokens and dilute existing holders. In line with this, the developers proposed a new method of improving its tokenomics and potentially boosting its price. If agreed by the community, Jito will evamp its tokenomics by introducing buybacks and barter, real yield gauges, and rewards or fee switch mechanisms. Real yield gauges is inspired by Curve, while buyback and barter is a process where protocol fees are swapped to JTO tokens and then deployed to partner DAOs. It is unclear which option that the Jito Foundation will opt. However, chances are that the proposal the community selects will help to boost the JTO token price. Jito price analysis JTO price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the JTO price has pulled back in the past few weeks, even as the protocol revenue has risen. It dropped from $4.3 in December to $2.5. The coin has moved slightly below the 25 and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages, a bearish sign. On the positive side, it is in the process of forming a falling wedge pattern, a popular bullish reversal sign. This pattern is made up of two converging downward-sloping trendlines. A breakout happens when the two lines are about to meet. Therefore, the coin will likely have a strong bullish breakout, with the next point to watch being at $4.33, its highest level in December.

In order to solve the traditional problems associated with land record keeping systems, an Indian town, Dantewada, has digitized over 700k of their land records on Avalanche Blockchain. As per the revelation, land records dating back to the 1950s have now been stored on the Avalanche Blockchain with support from Zupple’s LegitDoc Platform, making them tamper-proof and secure. The project has been spearheaded by the CEO of Dantewada Zila Panchayat, Jayant Mehta, in coordination with Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer Mayank Chaturvedi, District Collector of Dantewada, and is being mplemented under the division of the Office of Land Records. The initiative aims to enhance transparency, prevent land disputes, and modernize property management using blockchain technology – marking a significant milestone in India’s Digital Future. How Blockchain-Based Land Registry can help India has long faced challenges related to land ownership, including forgery, bureaucratic inefficiencies, and lengthy legal battles over disputed properties. Half of the pending litigations and cases before the Indian Judiciary are based on disputed claims between two persons/entities on same peice of land. By transitioning land records onto a blockchain ledger, authorities aim to tackle these persistent issues head-on. Avalanche’s blockchain technology can ensure that every transaction and update made to land records via its chain is permanently recorded and cannot be altered. This system will reduce the likelihood of fraud and unauthorized modifications, providing a higher level of trust among landowners, businesses, and government agencies. Sharing more insights on the implementation, Avalanche revealed in a X post that the Dantewada administration, in order to implement it, has installed small booths in every sub-district of the town, where citizens and government officers can access land information. This new integration on Avalanche will allow officials to search for land properties, download and view the digitized records on the blockchain. The app will also allow land officers and citizens to verify the smart contracts linked to the digital documents over the Avalanche Explorer, ensuring tamper-proof record keeping. Snapshot from Avalanche Explorer showing how it records Transactions Digitizing land records on a decentralized ledger would significantly cut down processing times for land transactions, eliminating middlemen, and improving efficiency in granting property rights. Smart contracts, a key feature of blockchain technology, can be employed to automate processes such as title transfers and property sales, reducing delays and enhancing transparency. Potential Economic and Social Impact The digitization of land records using blockchain technology could have far-reaching economic and social implications. A streamlined and trustworthy land administration system could boost investor confidence, attracting more real estate and infrastructure investments to the region. Further, this will significantly help indebted people in rural regions where poor people are often snatched off their property rights, owing to non-payment debt. A usual scenario, where a person even after paying debt cannot establish ownership claims on his property, is common in rural regions of India. Thus, individuals from rural areas who lack proper land documentation could benefit immensely. Secure land records can serve as proof of ownership, enabling landowners to access financial services such as loans and mortgages. Instances of fraud and loss of registration papers would also be reduced. The administrative system could also receive help in the implementation of government policies related to land reforms, urban planning, and agricultural development. India’s Growing Blockchain Adoption India has been steadily adopting blockchain technology in various sectors, from finance to governance. State governments in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Maharashtra have already initiated blockchain-based projects for land records and other administrative processes. Notably, in 2023, Niti Aayog, an Indian government think tank, declared a Maharashtra blockchain caste certification pilot, in association with Zupple on Polygon PoS Blockchain – making it the first time such recognition and recommendation for the use of public blockchain in E-governance was implemented. Niti-Aayog has declared a Maharashtra blockchain caste certification pilot, in association w/ @0xZupple , a model project in the social sector. This is the first time an Indian gov. think tank has recognized & recommended the use of public blockchain in E-governance #onPolygon — Polygon ※ (@0xPolygon) June 6, 2023 In October 2023, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) also collaborated with Zupple to enhance its purchase order processes using blockchain technology. With the growing emphasis on digital transformation, more Indian municipalities are expected to explore blockchain-based solutions to enhance governance and service delivery. Avalanche’s entry into this space underscores the increasing interest from global blockchain firms in India’s public sector initiatives. What’s Next for the Project? The rollout of this blockchain-based land record system will take place in multiple phases. Initially, authorities will conduct a pilot program covering a limited number of records before expanding to all 700,000 land parcels. Experts believe that if the initiative proves successful, it could serve as a model for other municipal towns and cities across India and even for other countries. With the rise of digital governance, more governments are already looking towards blockchain as a tool to enhance efficiency, reduce corruption, and ensure equitable property rights. As India continues its journey towards digital innovation, projects like these demonstrate the potential of blockchain technology in reshaping traditional bureaucratic processes and bringing long-term benefits to citizens and businesses alike.

Companies such as Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, and Uniswap are among those affected. The decisions, announced between February and early March, suggest a coordinated change in approach. SEC Lawsuit Wave: Suddenly Halted The SEC had previously filed lawsuits and launched investigations against various crypto companies over alleged securities violations. Binance and Coinbase were sued in June 2023, while Uniswap, Kraken, and OpenSea came under scrutiny in 2024. However, recent announcements confirm that these actions have either been dropped or put on hold.

Yescoin (YES), a popular mini-game within the Telegram Open Network (TON) ecosystem, has confirmed that its founder, Zhang Chi, is currently in police custody in Shanghai. This news has sent ripples through the crypto community, raising questions about the future of Yescoin and the broader implications for projects within the TON ecosystem. Let’s delve into the details of this developing story and understand what it means for Yescoin users and the crypto landscape. What We Know About the Yescoin Founder, Zhang Chi’s Detention According to an official announcement from the Yescoin team on X (formerly Twitter), Zhang Chi was detained by Shanghai police due to an ongoing business dispute with his partner, Wang Mouxin. Initially classified as a civil matter, the case has unfortunately escalated into a criminal investigation. While details remain scarce, the core issue seems to stem from disagreements between Zhang Chi and Wang Mouxin regarding their business operations. Here’s a quick breakdown of what we know: Founder Detained: Yescoin founder Zhang Chi is in custody of Shanghai police. Business Dispute: The detention is linked to a business dispute with partner Wang Mouxin. Criminal Case: The dispute, initially civil, has become a criminal case. Operational Continuity: Yescoin team assures users the platform operates normally. Community Support: Yescoin team thanked the community for their ongoing support during this uncertain time. The escalation from a civil dispute to a criminal case is a significant development, suggesting the allegations against Zhang Chi are serious. The crypto community is keenly watching for further updates as they unfold. Impact on the TON Ecosystem and Yescoin Operations Yescoin, being a prominent mini-game within the TON Ecosystem , naturally raises concerns about the project’s stability and future. The TON ecosystem itself is a vibrant and growing blockchain platform, and Yescoin’s popularity has contributed to its expansion. The immediate question on everyone’s mind is: will this detention disrupt Yescoin’s operations? The Yescoin team has been quick to reassure its community that it’s business as usual. In their official statement, they emphasized that the platform continues to operate normally. This suggests that the team has contingency plans in place to ensure the project’s continuity even in the absence of its founder. However, the long-term implications remain to be seen. Investor confidence and user sentiment can be sensitive to such events, and prolonged uncertainty could potentially impact Yescoin’s growth trajectory. Navigating the Challenges of Crypto Business Disputes This incident highlights the inherent challenges within the burgeoning crypto space, particularly regarding business disputes and legal frameworks. The decentralized and often borderless nature of crypto can complicate legal proceedings and dispute resolutions. While the specifics of the Zhang Chi case are unique, it serves as a stark reminder of the importance of robust legal agreements and clear operational guidelines in crypto ventures. Here are some key challenges and considerations: Regulatory Uncertainty: Crypto regulations are still evolving globally, leading to legal ambiguities in business disputes. Decentralized Nature: Cross-border operations and decentralized structures can complicate jurisdiction and enforcement. Partner Relationships: As with any business, disagreements among partners can arise, and in crypto, the stakes can be particularly high due to market volatility and rapid growth. Transparency and Communication: Maintaining transparent communication with the community is crucial during crises to manage user confidence and prevent panic. What Does this Mean for Yescoin Users? Actionable Insights For Yescoin users, the immediate message from the team is clear: continue playing and engaging as usual. The platform is operational, and the team is working to maintain normalcy. However, it’s always prudent to stay informed and exercise caution, especially in the volatile crypto market. Actionable Insights for Yescoin Users: Stay Informed: Follow Yescoin’s official communication channels (X, Telegram, etc.) for updates. Community Engagement: Engage with the Yescoin community to gauge sentiment and share information. Risk Management: Remember that all crypto investments carry risk. Diversification and cautious participation are always recommended. Platform Functionality: Continue to monitor the platform’s functionality and report any issues to the team. While the detention of Zhang Chi is undoubtedly concerning, the Yescoin team’s proactive communication and commitment to operational continuity are positive signs. The crypto community will be closely watching how this situation unfolds and its broader implications for the TON ecosystem and the crypto regulatory landscape. The Future of Yescoin and Crypto Project Leadership The long-term future of Yescoin and the question of leadership are now central to discussions within the community. How will Yescoin navigate this period of uncertainty? Will the existing team be able to effectively steer the project forward? These are critical questions that will determine Yescoin’s resilience and long-term success. This incident also prompts a broader reflection on leadership within crypto projects. The often-anonymous or semi-anonymous nature of crypto founders can present unique challenges when legal or personal issues arise. Transparency, clear succession plans, and robust governance structures are becoming increasingly important as the crypto industry matures. In conclusion, the detention of Yescoin founder Zhang Chi is a significant event that underscores the complexities and risks inherent in the crypto world. While the Yescoin team assures continued operations, the situation warrants close monitoring. It serves as a crucial reminder of the importance of legal compliance, robust business practices, and transparent communication in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. The crypto community awaits further developments in this shocking case, hoping for a swift and equitable resolution that minimizes disruption to the Yescoin project and the wider TON ecosystem.

While Solana remains a key player in the blockchain space, newer projects like Panshibi are attracting attention, especially in the meme coin sector. Investors are weighing whether SHIBI’s growing popularity could challenge existing meme coins in 2025. Understanding how these factors influence market trends could help traders navigate upcoming opportunities. Panshibi Presale Sells Out Fast as Investors Bet on $SHIBI Panshibi is proving to be more than just another meme coin, as its presale continues to sell out at record speed. Unlike many tokens that rely purely on speculation, Panshibi integrates real engagement through social-fi, allowing users to compete in quests, earn rewards, and participate in an active ecosystem. This gives the token a strong foundation beyond hype. Moreover, Panshibi’s branding is setting it apart. The panda theme makes $SHIBI a standout choice for investors looking for something different. Its strong traction in Asia is further fueling global adoption, bringing in new holders daily. Additionally, security and trust are locked in. Coinsult’s contract audit has already been completed with zero issues, reassuring investors that Panshibi is built for long-term success. At the same time, SHIBI’s liquidity pool is locked for 10 years, removing the risk of sudden dumps that have plagued many other meme coins. As the presale crosses the halfway mark, analysts are already predicting a major price breakout once SHIBI hits exchanges. Early buyers have seen the price increase across presale stages, with expectations of even bigger gains post-launch. With meme coins surging in market share, all signs point to a massive year ahead. SOL Surges to $168 Before Dropping: What’s Next? Following President Trump's public statement to establish a US strategic crypto reserve, Solana's price went from $140 to $168 within hours. This was short-lived, however, as SOLsubsequently dropped to $131, a 55% decline from an all-time high price of $294. While the Solana price prediction suggests that SOL could reach $300 within the year, others suggest a potential decrease to $146 by June 6, 2025. Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana's founder, expressed concerns regarding the US strategic crypto reserve. He warns that such centralized governmental involvement could pose risks to the decentralization that is fundamental to blockchain technologies. Although the inclusion of Solana in the US strategic crypto reserve underscores its prominence in the crypto space, investors should approach the play out with caution. The market's inherent volatility, coupled with 18 red days in the past month, necessitates careful consideration and due diligence. Conclusion In barely over a month, Panshibi’s presale has seen an inflow of over $1.22 million. With investors rushing in, it’s only a matter of time before seats in the Bamboo Valley run out. Currently in its fourth stage, potential investors can secure early positions for $0.005 per SHIBI token. Invest now and become a part of the next memecoin revolution!

New tokens explode onto the market, fueled by hype and a rampant media, only for many to collapse just as quickly. This is the story of $TRUMP and $MELANIA, two politically charged meme coins that captured the market’s attention, only to fall from their once-lofty heights. At their peak, $TRUMP surged to record highs in a matter of hours, drawing attention from both crypto traders and the political sphere. Likewise, $MELANIA launched soon after with immense investor interest, promising a wave of enthusiasm behind a first-lady-inspired digital asset. But where are they now? $TRUMP is now down 82% from its peak. $MELANIA has plummeted by 94%. The question isn’t whether these tokens once had potential, but more why they couldn’t sustain it. This volatility opens the door for a new kind of meme coin, one that isn’t built solely on hype but offers real utility, AI integration, and long-term sustainability. That’s where FloppyPepe (FPPE) steps in. $TRUMP and $MELANIA: The Boom and Bust Cycle of Hype Coins Political meme coins are often short-lived. $TRUMP and $MELANIA’s surprise launches were met with enormous fanfare, making the most of political sentiment and the huge media coverage around the new presidency to skyrocket in value. But just like many tokens that rely on branding rather than functionality, the momentum quickly faded. $TRUMP’s trading volume collapsed, leading to an 82% drop from its peak. $MELANIA suffered an even sharper decline, sinking 94% below its highest price. Speculators and moneymakers exited fast, leaving late buyers with major losses. What these coins lacked was a mechanism for sustained engagement. Without staking rewards, AI integration, or real-world reason to HODL, their communities moved on to the next big thing. Why FloppyPepe (FPPE) Stands Apart from the Hype Coins Unlike the aforementioned short-lived tokens, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is built for longevity. As well as being a meme coin, it’s also an AI-powered platform with real utility, giving it a far stronger foundation than projects like $TRUMP and $MELANIA. Here’s how FloppyPepe differentiates itself: AI-Driven Utility → FPPE features the Meme-o-Matic AI generator and FloppyX AI video bot, keeping engagement levels high through AI-powered content creation. Staking Rewards → Unlike hype-based coins, FPPE holders earn passive income through staking, giving them a reason to hold long-term. Community Governance → FloppyPepe’s Meme DAO allows investors to vote on decisions, keeping the project dynamic and community-driven. Deflationary Mechanics → A 1% burn on every transaction means FPPE’s supply decreases over time, driving potential price appreciation. Wildlife Conservation → Every transaction helps sponsor real hippos and support conservation efforts, making FPPE a meme coin with impact. With this level of engagement, utility, and financial incentives, FloppyPepe avoids the pitfalls that have so far doomed $TRUMP and $MELANIA. FloppyPepe vs. $TRUMP and $MELANIA: Which Is the Smarter Investment? Feature FloppyPepe (FPPE) $TRUMP Coin $MELANIA Coin AI Integration ✅ Yes – Meme-o-Matic & FloppyX AI ❌ No ❌ No Staking Rewards ✅ Yes – Passive Income ❌ No ❌ No Community Governance ✅ Meme DAO ❌ No ❌ No Deflationary Model ✅ 1% Burn per Transaction ❌ No ❌ No Wildlife Conservation ✅ Real Hippo Sponsorships ❌ No ❌ No Volatility Risk ✅ Lower (AI-backed & staking incentives) ❌ Extreme (82% decline) ❌ Extreme (94% decline) Why FPPE Could Win the Popular Vote Short-lived meme coins like $TRUMP and $MELANIA may offer quick surges, but their extreme crashes make them unreliable for long-term investors. The lack of utility, governance, or sustainable incentive structures caused them to fade quickly. With hype-based meme coins proving unsustainable, FloppyPepe is a legitimate contender for the top crypto presale of 2025. 60% Bonus $FPPE: A Presale for the Ages - Closing Soon!

In 2028, the coin could be worth between $18.49 and $21.97, with an average price of $19.01. By 2031, Cosmos (ATOM) might touch $67.56. Cosmos (ATOM) is a blockchain ecosystem that facilitates interoperability among independent blockchains. Co-founded by Jae Kwon and Ethan Buchman in 2014, Cosmos aims to create a decentralized network of blockchains that can communicate and transact seamlessly. Its main components include the Cosmos Hub, which serves as the central chain, and multiple “zones” that operate under their own rules while connecting to the Hub. The platform uses the Tendermint consensus algorithm and Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable fast low-cost transactions. Fees average around $0.01, and confirmation times are approximately seven seconds. Cosmos employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, allowing users to stake their ATOM tokens for network security and transaction validation. Since its ICO in 2017, Cosmos has raised significant funding and established a growing ecosystem, including notable projects like Terra and Binance. With over 286 million ATOM tokens in circulation and a market cap exceeding $7.7 billion, Cosmos is positioned as a key player in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology, often referred to as the “Internet of Blockchains” for its ambitious goal of connecting diverse blockchain networks.

Is Cosmos a good investment? Cosmos (ATOM) shows potential as an investment due to its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and recent upgrades like ATOM 2.0. Analysts predict long-term price growth, but the crypto market is highly volatile. Investors should conduct their research and consider risks before investing in ATOM. Is Cosmos a Safe Network? The Cosmos network is built on the Tendermint consensus protocol, offering robust security and interoperability features. However, like all blockchain systems, it faces potential risks, requiring users to remain cautious and well-informed about emerging vulnerabilities and challenges. Will Cosmos reach $50? Based on Cosmo’s current market trends and growth projections, Cosmos (ATOM) is expected to reach a value of approximately $45.96 by 2030. Will Cosmos reach $100?

Our forecasts place its maximum potential around $67.56 by 2031, indicating limited short-term growth potential. Does Cosmos have a good long-term future? Cosmos (ATOM) promises a strong long-term future, with forecasts indicating significant price increases over the next decade. Analysts predict that ATOM could reach values as high as $45.96 by 2030, driven by its unique position in the blockchain ecosystem and ongoing developments in interoperability and scalability. The Cosmos Hub is well-established and supported by a dedicated community, enhancing its growth and adoption prospects in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

Cosmos historic price sentiment Cosmos price history Cosmos, created by Ethan Buchman and Jae Kwon, launched its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2017, with the network officially going live two years later in 2019. During the bullish market cycle of 2021, Cosmos saw its price peak at over $44, driven by significant investor interest and market optimism. However, following this surge, on 3rd April 2022, the price of Cosmos (ATOM) sharply declined to $6.39. Since then, Cosmos entered a prolonged phase of consolidation, trading within a range between $6.39 and $16 as market dynamics fluctuated. In early 2024, particularly around 8th March, Cosmos encountered significant resistance at the $13 level, struggling to gain momentum above this point. This resistance reflected broader market sentiment and potential selling pressure. By July 2024, ATOM’s price was trading in a narrower range, between $5 and $6, indicating a lack of upward momentum. By August 2024, the price had further dipped to $4.02, suggesting increasing bearish pressure. This recent decline highlights ongoing challenges for Cosmos in maintaining its price stability and suggests potential further downside as market bears dominate, putting pressure on potential buyers to defend against a continued downward trend. On September 2024, the Cosmos price ranged between $4 to $5, and on October 06, the price traded at $4.5837 with a trading volume of $48.48M. On November 5, ATOM was trading at $4.10. By December 5, ATOM’s price surged significantly, trading at $10. Cosmos ATOM surged to $9 at the start of December 2024, but it declined to $9.6 and closed the year at $6.3. In January 2025, Cosmos peaked at $7.77, and in February, it’s trading between $4.54 and $4.86. ATOM value decreased further in March as it dipped to the $4.0 to $4.2 range.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ATOM|TRADING|ICO|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-07 17:39:38

The winds are shifting in Washington, and it sounds like Bitcoin is finally getting the attention it deserves from the top echelons of power. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has just dropped a bombshell, signaling a potentially seismic shift in the U.S. approach to cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin. Let’s dive into what this could mean for the future of Bitcoin and the U.S.’s role in the global crypto landscape. Why is Bitcoin Leadership Suddenly a Priority for the U.S. Treasury? For years, the relationship between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies has been… complicated, to say the least. Skepticism, cautious regulation, and sometimes outright hostility have characterized the stance of many government bodies. So, why the sudden change of heart? Why is the U.S. Treasury now talking about Bitcoin leadership ? Several factors could be at play: Geopolitical Strategy: In a world increasingly shaped by technological innovation and digital assets, countries are vying for dominance in the crypto space. Recognizing Bitcoin’s significance, the U.S. may be aiming to secure a leading position rather than being left behind. Economic Opportunity: The cryptocurrency industry is a multi-billion dollar sector, and growing. Embracing Bitcoin leadership could attract investment, innovation, and jobs to the U.S., boosting the economy. National Security: Ignoring or suppressing Bitcoin could push innovation offshore, potentially weakening the U.S.’s technological and financial standing. Taking a proactive stance allows for better oversight and control within the domestic sphere. Investor Protection (Potentially): While not explicitly stated, a more supportive stance could lead to clearer regulatory frameworks, ultimately offering better protection for investors within the crypto market. It’s crucial to note that this is a developing situation. Secretary Bessent’s comments are a significant signal, but the actual policies and actions that follow will determine the true impact. However, the shift in rhetoric is undeniable and certainly noteworthy. Decoding the Call to Halt BTC Sales: A Strategic Masterstroke? One of the most intriguing aspects of Secretary Bessent’s statement is the call to halt government BTC sales . This is a potentially massive development, and here’s why: Reduced Market Pressure: Governments, particularly those involved in seizures or early Bitcoin acquisitions, sometimes hold significant amounts of BTC. Regular sales from these holdings can exert downward pressure on the Bitcoin market. Halting these sales could alleviate some of that pressure, potentially stabilizing or even boosting prices. Symbol of Confidence: Stopping BTC sales could be interpreted as a sign of confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. It suggests that the U.S. Treasury views Bitcoin not as a liability to be disposed of, but as an asset to be held or even strategically managed. Strategic Accumulation (Possible Future Implication): While not explicitly stated, halting sales could be a precursor to a more strategic approach to Bitcoin, which might even involve future accumulation. This is speculative, but it’s a possibility worth considering. To truly understand the impact of halting BTC sales , we need more clarity on which government entities are currently selling Bitcoin and the scale of these sales. However, the very suggestion of stopping these sales is a significant departure from a purely reactive or dismissive approach to Bitcoin. Bringing Bitcoin Onshore: Reclaiming Crypto Innovation Secretary Bessent’s emphasis on “bringing Bitcoin onshore” is another key element of his statement. What does this actually mean, and why is it important? Bringing Bitcoin onshore can be interpreted in several ways, all pointing towards fostering a more favorable environment for Bitcoin-related activities within the United States: Attracting Businesses: Creating a regulatory landscape that is clear, predictable, and supportive can attract Bitcoin companies, exchanges, and innovators to establish or expand their operations in the U.S. Currently, some companies are hesitant due to regulatory uncertainty. Encouraging Mining: Bitcoin mining, while energy-intensive, is a crucial part of the Bitcoin network. Bringing Bitcoin onshore could involve policies that support sustainable mining practices within the U.S., ensuring network security and decentralization are geographically distributed. Talent Retention and Attraction: A thriving Bitcoin industry in the U.S. will attract and retain top talent in blockchain technology, cryptography, and finance. This brain gain is essential for maintaining a competitive edge in the digital economy. Regulatory Clarity: Perhaps most importantly, bringing Bitcoin onshore necessitates clear and sensible cryptocurrency regulation . Businesses and individuals need to understand the rules of the game to operate confidently and compliantly. The challenge, of course, lies in crafting regulations that are both effective in protecting consumers and preventing illicit activities, while also fostering innovation and avoiding stifling growth. It’s a delicate balance, but Secretary Bessent’s statement suggests a willingness to strike that balance in a way that supports Bitcoin leadership . The Role of Cryptocurrency Regulation in Achieving Bitcoin Leadership Let’s face it, the elephant in the room when it comes to cryptocurrency is regulation. For the U.S. to truly achieve Bitcoin leadership , a robust and forward-thinking regulatory framework is absolutely essential. But what kind of cryptocurrency regulation is needed? Here are some key considerations: Aspect of Regulation Why It’s Important for Bitcoin Leadership Clarity and Certainty Businesses need to know the rules to operate and invest confidently. Vague or conflicting regulations stifle innovation. Innovation-Friendly Approach Regulations should encourage responsible innovation, not stifle it. A balanced approach is needed to foster growth while managing risks. Consumer Protection Protecting investors and users from fraud and scams is paramount. Effective regulation builds trust in the crypto space. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) Addressing legitimate concerns about illicit activities is crucial for mainstream acceptance and regulatory approval. Interoperability and Global Standards Harmonizing regulations with international standards can facilitate cross-border transactions and prevent regulatory arbitrage. Secretary Bessent’s remarks suggest a potential shift towards a more constructive and proactive approach to cryptocurrency regulation . Whether this translates into tangible policy changes remains to be seen, but the signal is encouraging for the crypto industry. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what should you, as a crypto enthusiast or investor, take away from this news? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on developments coming out of the U.S. Treasury and other regulatory bodies. Policy changes can have a significant impact on the crypto market. Consider U.S.-Focused Crypto Projects: If the U.S. does indeed move towards a more supportive stance on Bitcoin and crypto, projects based in or focused on the U.S. market could benefit. Advocate for Sensible Regulation: Engage with policymakers and industry groups to advocate for cryptocurrency regulation that balances innovation with consumer protection. Your voice matters! Long-Term Optimism (Cautiously): While regulatory landscapes are always subject to change, Secretary Bessent’s statement offers a reason for cautious long-term optimism about Bitcoin’s future in the U.S. and globally. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Bitcoin and U.S. Crypto Strategy Secretary Bessent’s statement is more than just words; it’s a potential turning point. His call for Bitcoin leadership , halting BTC sales , and bringing Bitcoin onshore signals a significant shift in the U.S. government’s approach to cryptocurrency. While challenges remain, and concrete policy changes are still needed, this is undoubtedly a positive development for the Bitcoin community and the broader crypto ecosystem. The journey to true Bitcoin leadership is just beginning, but the U.S. Treasury has just signaled it’s ready to take the reins. The world will be watching closely.

Here are the highlights from Powell's critical speech: The Fed is in no rush to adjust interest rates. The labor market is solid and generally balanced. Inflation is slightly above the 2% target but is gradually approaching it. Uncertainty about the Trump administration’s policies and their economic impact remains high. Some recent inflation expectations surveys and market indicators have shown increases due to tariffs. Most long-term inflation expectations remain stable and consistent with the 2% target. The Fed is fully prepared to wait for a clearer picture. The net effect of trade, immigration, fiscal and regulatory policies is the factor that has the greatest impact on economic and monetary policy. The Fed's policy is not set in stone; if inflation progress stagnates, policy may remain restrictive, or if the labor market weakens unexpectedly or inflation declines unexpectedly, policy may be eased. Related News: White House Official Makes Very Confusing Statement About Cardano (ADA), Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) - Bringing a Drop Despite high uncertainty, the US economy is in good shape. The path to achieving the 2% inflation target will be bumpy; the Fed will not overreact to one or two economic data reports that are higher or lower than expected. Recent indicators point to a possible slowdown in consumer spending and increased uncertainty; it remains to be seen how these developments will impact future spending and investment. Fed Chair Powell reiterated that the 2% inflation target is not the focus of the Fed's framework review; the results of the review will be released in late summer. U.S. short-term interest rate futures maintained their forecast that the Fed will cut interest rates in June and expect a total of three rate cuts in 2025 after Powell said the Fed did not need to rush to act. *This is not investment advice.

The Cardano price prediction is again favorable, as analysts predict a massive surge following its recent spike to $1.13. This positive sentiment in the Cardano price follows the announcement of a strategic crypto reserve for the tenth-largest cryptocurrency. In similar developments, Panshibi , a low-cap crypto, is attracting serious attention. Its stellar presale rakes above $1.2 million in just over one month. The Panda-themed token is making a grand entrance into the meme coin space, and crypto pundits believe it is the best crypto to buy now. So, let's dig into the latest trend involving these cryptos and see why Panshibi is the best option. Panshibi: Pushing the meme coin frontiers with real utility The meme market has entered a new phase after a 500% market cap increase in 2024. Desoiteholds over $56 billion in valuation, and meme culture has been criticized for lacking real-world use cases and utility. But Panshibi is about to lead a revolution in this area. The project is doing this by actively contributing to a meaningful cause. During the presale, a portion of its ecosystem funds will go to panda conservation initiatives. This prospect provides resources for habitat preservation, wildlife research, and breeding programs to help protect the species. With this philanthropic gesture, Panshibi proves that the meme coin space can exist beyond speculative trading and provide avenues for investors to make a real-life impact. Although this community-driven initiative deserves applause, Panshibi is not stopping there; it plans to provide staggering rewards to its investors. When holders stake the Panshibi token, they earn up to 1,200% APY rewards. These investors can also receive more incentives by participating in several contests. Lastly, early adopters gain exclusive entry to the Bamboo Private VIP Club, which benefits those who get ahead of the crowd. Another unique feature of Panshibi's project is that it is not subject to the rug-pull scams plaguing the meme coin sector. The project locks its liquidity for ten years and two years for team tokens . Additionally, Coinsult has fully audited the project smart Contract, ensuring it is free from vulnerabilities or errors. With this level of trustworthiness, Panshibi is one of the best cryptos to buy now. Cardano price prediction: Bulls target $3 amid growing excitement and heavy buying Following its market sluggishness since the beginning of 2025, ADA is stealing the spotlight with serious price action. Right now, ADA trades at $0.9138. It recently pumped almost 75% to $1.10, dropping to $0.80 the next day before stabilizing at its current price point. These surges started after Donald Trump announced that the ADA was included in the plans of a strategic crypto reserve. Moreover, even more excitement is brewing for Cardano, especially with several positive updates around ADA. These updates include the likely ETF launch , its transition to becoming the main DeFi sidechain for Bitcoin, and the possibility that the US Treasury will select Cardano as one of its chosen payment blockchains. These potentials have uplifted ADA recently, and while it would likely take a serious liquidity boom to see Cardano surge above its previous all-time high price. Investors race to Panshibi for its 100x appeal. While the Cardano price suggests a breakout opportunity, Panshibi’s 100x potential makes it a solid investment choice. Investors continue to race to the Panshibi presale to grab their share of SHIBI tokens before its meme coin rally starts. The presale has raised over $1.2 million, with tokens on offer for an alluring price of just $0.005 in the current stage. Well-grounded investors are taking notice, and with only 18 days left, significant demand could enter, leading to a price surge. Take action before it's too late!

In the announcement, shared with crypto.news via a press release, noted that Core will bring these features to users eyeing opportunities in the decentralized finance ecosystem across Asia. Core plans to offer this functionality via its DeFi-as-a-Service platform, with its sights on institutional adoption of BTC staking. “Our integration with Cobo, a trusted leader in digital asset custody and blockchain infrastructure, greatly enhances the Core ecosystem by onboarding liquidity from high-caliber institutional clients,” Brendon Sedo, an initial contributor at Core, said. Read more: The Core Foundation and partners launch new institutional Bitcoin yield token The integration means Cobo users can now stake both Bitcoin and CORE tokens to earn BTC yields. Core will allow institutional investors to leverage the platform’s overall accessibility to benefit from “sustainable and self-custodial Bitcoin yields.” Cobo’s blockchain solutions, which includes a secure and scalable network, will be key to this goal, Sedo added. “By integrating Core’s innovative Dual Staking model with Cobo’s trusted infrastructure, we’re further advancing institutional access to scalable and sustainable Bitcoin yields, paving the way for broader adoption of secure BTC staking solutions,” Changhao Jiang, chief technology officer of Cobo, noted. Core Foundation’s collaboration with Cobo builds on the platform’s previous traction in the Bitcoin staking, with institutions having leveraged its layer to stake more than 6,200 BTC. Core’s end-to-end Bitcoin finance solution also features network security by miners. Miners earn CORE tokens when they help secure the network by delegating hash power, with this around 76% of delegated Bitcoin hashrate. Core launched in 2023 and growth in the BTCfi ecosystem has seen Core integrate more than 150 Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible decentralized applications. In December 2024, Core teamed up with Hashnote to unlock more BTC yields for users. That partnership helped bump Core’s total value locked, or TVL, which currently stands at over $525 million . Meanwhile, Cobot, founded in 2017, has helped over 500 digital asset businesses tap into on-chain opportunities.

The latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls data just dropped, and it’s sending ripples across traditional markets – and potentially the crypto sphere too. February’s jobs report has landed below expectations, raising eyebrows and sparking questions about the Federal Reserve’s next moves. Let’s dive into what this means and why it should be on your crypto radar. Why Did the February Jobs Report Miss Market Expectations? The U.S. jobs report for February revealed an increase of 151,000 nonfarm payrolls, a figure that fell short of the anticipated 159,000. While any job growth is generally positive, the miss against forecasts is significant. This data point, released by the U.S. Department of Labor, is a crucial barometer of the US economy’s health. Several factors could contribute to this slight dip, including seasonal adjustments, weather impacts, or potentially a subtle cooling in certain sectors. Let’s break down the key figures: Nonfarm Payrolls: Increased by 151,000 in February (Expected: 159,000) Unemployment Rate: Rose slightly to 4.1% (Forecast: 4.0%) While the unemployment rate saw a marginal increase, it remains at a historically low level. However, the combination of lower-than-expected job creation and a tick up in unemployment can paint a mixed picture of the labor market. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? You might be wondering, “Why should crypto investors care about nonfarm payrolls ?” The answer lies in the interconnectedness of global finance. Traditional economic indicators like the jobs report significantly influence Federal Reserve policy, interest rates, and overall investor sentiment – all of which can indirectly and sometimes directly impact the cryptocurrency market. Here’s how this data point can create ripples in the crypto world: Federal Reserve Policy: Weaker-than-expected job growth could make the Federal Reserve more cautious about raising interest rates aggressively. Lower interest rates can be perceived as positive for risk assets like cryptocurrencies, as they reduce the attractiveness of traditional fixed-income investments. Dollar Strength: A slightly weaker jobs report might lead to a temporary weakening of the U.S. dollar. Historically, a weaker dollar can sometimes correlate with increased interest in alternative assets like Bitcoin, which are seen as hedges against currency devaluation. Investor Sentiment: Economic uncertainty stemming from mixed economic data can lead to increased market volatility. In such times, some investors may seek refuge in assets perceived as having limited correlation with traditional markets, and cryptocurrencies can sometimes be viewed in this light, although their volatility is a key consideration. Navigating Market Expectations and Crypto Investments Understanding market expectations is crucial for any investor, especially in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. Financial markets, including crypto, are forward-looking. They often react more to surprises or deviations from anticipated trends than to the absolute numbers themselves. In this case, the slight miss in nonfarm payrolls is the surprise element. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on further economic data releases and statements from the Federal Reserve. These will provide more clues about the future direction of monetary policy. Manage Risk: Market uncertainty can amplify volatility. Ensure your portfolio is appropriately diversified and that you are managing your risk tolerance effectively. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging: In volatile periods, dollar-cost averaging (DCA) can be a prudent strategy to mitigate risk and build positions over time. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that economic data is just one piece of the puzzle. The long-term fundamentals of many cryptocurrencies, including technological advancements and adoption rates, remain important drivers. Challenges and Opportunities in a Dynamic Economic Landscape The current economic landscape presents both challenges and opportunities for crypto investors. Challenges include: Increased Volatility: Economic uncertainty often leads to higher market volatility across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Scrutiny: Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are increasingly focusing on cryptocurrency regulation, which can introduce uncertainty and impact market sentiment. Macroeconomic Factors: Cryptocurrencies are not immune to broader macroeconomic trends. Inflation, interest rate changes, and global economic growth can all influence crypto markets. However, there are also significant opportunities : Hedge Against Inflation: Some investors view cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as a potential hedge against inflation, although this narrative is still evolving. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): The growth of DeFi offers new avenues for earning yield and participating in financial markets outside of traditional systems. Technological Innovation: The underlying technology of blockchain and cryptocurrencies continues to evolve, creating new use cases and potential for future growth. The Bigger Picture: US Economy and the Crypto Ecosystem The US economy remains a global powerhouse, and its performance has far-reaching consequences. While the February jobs report might be slightly underwhelming, it’s crucial to remember that it’s just one data point in a complex economic narrative. The crypto ecosystem, while still relatively young, is increasingly intertwined with the traditional financial world. Understanding these macroeconomic signals, such as the jobs report , can provide valuable insights for navigating the crypto market. In conclusion, the February nonfarm payrolls data serves as a reminder of the dynamic interplay between traditional economics and the cryptocurrency market. While the miss in expectations might introduce short-term volatility, it also underscores the importance of staying informed, managing risk, and maintaining a long-term perspective in the exciting and ever-evolving world of crypto.

The analyst forecasts the value of the cryptocurrency could rise to $150 in the coming weeks. Apart from LTC, analysts are also bullish about Cardano. Coinvopredicts its price could rise to $3.2. While veterans like Litecoin (LTC) and Cardano (ADA) have potential, a new contender is also capturing investors' attention. Remittix (RTX) is a rising altcoin making waves with its innovative approach to crypto-to-fiat payments, attracting both seasoned investors and newcomers looking for the next big breakout. Its price is expected to rise by 10x in the coming months from its current value of $0.0694. Litecoin Price Predicted To Rise To $150 The Litecoin price has witnessed a sharp decline from the $130 range after meeting with selling pressure. CoinMarketCap data shows the Litecoin price dropped to $100 before rising up again. As a result of the latest correction, the altcoin price has dropped by 16.3% in the weekly timeframe. The cryptocurrency is also down by 15.8% in the biweekly chart. However, the Litecoin price is up 8.0% on the monthly level. Going forward, Paulo Ricci forecasts the Litecoin price could rise to $150 in the coming months. The analyst posted a Litecoin price chart which showed LTC trading in a descending channel. Paulo Ricci’s LTC price prediction A breakout is needed to push the Litecoin price to the $150 target in the coming weeks. Technical indicators are currently in support of this potential uptrend. The Stochastic Fast (14) and Williams Percent Range (14) are in the buying territory which means that bulls are fighting to pull a trend reversal. Cardano (ADA) Predicted To Reach $3.2 Since the beginning of March, the ADA price has been trading between $0.6 and $1. Bulls have been trying to flip the $1 region into a major support level but have failed. Right now, the ADA price is showing positive movements on the charts. CoinMarketCap data shows the ADA price has soared by 44.0% on the weekly timeframe. Coinvo forecasts the ADA price could see more parabolic growth in the next few weeks. They posted a Cardano price chart which showed potential targets of $3.2 in the short term and $10.5 in the long term. Cardano’s potential trajectory, per Coinvo Meanwhile, another analyst known as CW believes the ADA price could skyrocket to $1.95 in the coming weeks. According to them, the DeFi coin has no major wall until this level. Interestingly, Cardano’s latest uptick comes after its addition to the US Crypto Reserve. Data from Santiment shows that whales have bought over $420 million since the announcement. Remittix (RTX) Presale Grows As Cross-Border Payments Feature Attracts Investors Despite the bullish Litecoin price forecast, Remittix (RTX) has raised more excitement among traders. It is the best ICO in the market. Currently, the price of RTX is $0.0694, which is more than 890% higher than the initial price of $0.007, which makes RTX one of the best altcoins. The project has also received $13.5 million in funding. Remittix is one of the few that would enable the integration of cryptocurrency with the current banking systems to enhance cross-border payments. Remittix allows its users to exchange more than 100 cryptocurrencies for fiat money and transfer the funds to any bank account globally, which means no intermediaries, which makes it faster and cheaper.

Traders on the top global crypto exchange can now buy and sell RED , the native asset of the modular blockchain oracle RedStone. RedStone bills itself as “the fastest-growing blockchain oracle” with users on more than 80 chains. “In 2024 alone RedStone user base grew by over 500%, and Total Value Secured grew by over 6,000%. Powered by novel, sustainable tokenomics, RED will accrue REAL YIELD from RedStone data users. Staked RED will receive a portion of data consumer fees as RedStone scales to secure thousands of blockchains and trillions of dollars in on-chain finance.” Binance’s listing was postponed by three hours on Thursday “due to unexpected and last minute changes by RedStone (RED) to the allocation of their community airdrop distribution.” RED is trading at $0.68 at time of writing. The 278th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down more than 27% on its first day of trading. Binance attached a seed tag to RED, a designation the exchange attaches to lower-liquidity projects that could exhibit higher volatility compared to other listed tokens. Binance requires users who want to trade assets with seed tags to pass quizzes every 90 days to ensure they’re aware of the risks.

The company, traded on NASDAQ as FLD, announced a substantial acquisition of 475 BTC, injecting nearly 50% growth into its treasury. This strategic accumulation, detailed by CoinDesk, propels Fold’s total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 1,485 BTC. But what does this aggressive move signal for Fold and the broader landscape of cryptocurrency investment ? Let’s dive into the details. Fold’s Astonishing Increase in BTC Holdings: A Deep Dive Fold’s recent acquisition of 475 BTC is not just a minor top-up; it’s a significant leap that underscores the company’s commitment to Bitcoin as a core asset. This bold move positions Fold amongst the elite U.S. public companies boasting the largest BTC holdings . Here’s a breakdown of what we know: Strategic Acquisition: Fold secured the 475 BTC through a convertible note, indicating a calculated financial maneuver to bolster its Bitcoin treasury. Substantial Growth: This single purchase increased Fold’s Bitcoin reserves by nearly 50%, demonstrating a strong bullish stance on Bitcoin’s future.

Understanding Fold’s Strategy Several factors could be driving Fold’s decision to substantially increase its BTC holdings . Let’s explore some potential motivations: Long-Term Bitcoin Bullishness: Fold’s leadership likely holds a strong long-term belief in Bitcoin’s appreciation. Accumulating BTC now could be seen as a strategic investment to benefit from future price surges. Treasury Diversification: In an era of economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a valuable treasury asset, offering diversification away from traditional fiat currencies. Attracting Bitcoin-Savvy Customers: For a Bitcoin-focused company like Fold, holding significant BTC reserves can enhance its credibility and appeal to its target audience of Bitcoin enthusiasts. It signals a deep alignment with the values and principles of the Bitcoin community. Potential Revenue Generation: Holding Bitcoin can also open up opportunities for yield generation through various Bitcoin-based financial products and services, further strengthening Fold’s financial position. But are there any challenges associated with such a significant cryptocurrency investment ? Navigating the Challenges of Large Bitcoin Treasuries While holding a substantial Bitcoin treasury offers numerous advantages, it’s not without its challenges. Companies like Fold must navigate: Volatility Management: Bitcoin’s price volatility is well-known. Managing risk associated with these price swings is crucial. Companies need robust treasury management strategies to mitigate potential downsides. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Companies holding large BTC reserves must stay ahead of regulatory changes and ensure compliance. Security and Custody: Securely storing and managing a large Bitcoin treasury is paramount. Robust custody solutions and security protocols are essential to protect against theft or loss. Accounting and Reporting: Accounting for Bitcoin holdings can be complex. Companies need to adhere to evolving accounting standards and reporting requirements for digital assets. Despite these challenges, Fold’s commitment to expanding its institutional Bitcoin holdings indicates a strong belief that the rewards outweigh the risks. Fold’s Move in Context: The Broader Trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Fold’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition is not an isolated event. It’s part of a growing trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption. More and more public companies are recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and a strategic asset. This trend is fueled by: Growing Mainstream Acceptance: Bitcoin is becoming increasingly accepted as a legitimate asset class by institutional investors and corporations. Inflation Hedge Narrative: Concerns about inflation are driving institutions to seek alternative assets like Bitcoin to preserve capital. Decentralization and Innovation: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and its potential to disrupt traditional finance are attracting forward-thinking companies. Competitive Advantage: Early adoption of Bitcoin can provide companies with a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving digital economy. Fold’s decision to bolster its Bitcoin treasury is a powerful example of this trend in action. It sends a clear signal that Bitcoin is not just a speculative asset but a strategic component of corporate treasury management. Actionable Insights: What Does Fold’s Bitcoin Accumulation Mean for You? Fold’s strategic move provides valuable insights for both individuals and businesses interested in the cryptocurrency investment space: For Individuals: Fold’s action reinforces the long-term investment thesis for Bitcoin. It highlights the growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s future. If you’re considering Bitcoin, Fold’s move adds to the growing body of evidence supporting its potential. For Businesses: Fold’s example can inspire businesses to explore Bitcoin as a treasury asset. While careful consideration of risks and regulatory compliance is essential, the potential benefits of Bitcoin exposure are becoming increasingly apparent. For the Crypto Industry: Fold’s move is a positive signal for the entire cryptocurrency industry. It demonstrates the continued maturation and institutionalization of Bitcoin and digital assets. Conclusion: Fold’s Bitcoin Power Play Signals a Bright Future Fold Holdings’ substantial increase in its Bitcoin treasury is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a bold statement of belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and potential.

With 10% allocated to the burn pool, this translates to roughly 7 cents worth of SHIB burned per duel, potentially reducing supply as more players engage. SHIB Rises for 4 Days in a Row Despite the Market’s Weakness Token burns reduce a token’s circulating supply, creating scarcity that can drive short-term price increases. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is up 0.8% in the past 24 hours, trading at $0.00001364, bucking the broader meme coin trend. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bonk (BONK) have dropped 2.9% and 3%, while the overall meme coin market cap has declined 3% to $55.5 billion. Yesterday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order (EO) establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile. However, the EO specified that only government-owned assets would be included, disappointing investors and triggering a market-wide sell-off. Despite this, SHIB has remained resilient, posting gains for four consecutive days. However, it has yet to fully recover from Monday’s sharp decline. The daily chart shows that the asset is still on a downtrend. To reverse this, SHIB would have to break above the $0.00001530 level in the next few days. Momentum indicators favor a bullish outlook as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) moved above the signal line. The MACD’s histogram shows some erratic behavior and shows no clear direction. SHIB’s upside potential seems limited at the time. However, top crypto presales like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) offer significant upside potential to early buyers. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) Leverage the Power of AI to Launch a Powerful AI Agent MIND of Pepe ($MIND) leverages AI to provide token holders with valuable insights, helping them navigate market conditions and capitalize on emerging meme coin opportunities. The AI agent gathers data from X (formerly Twitter), delivering key intelligence to MIND holders. As its influence grows, it will also have the ability to mint new assets and grant $MIND holders exclusive access to private sales, maximizing their potential returns. Once it has harnessed enough influence, it can also mint new assets and give $MIND investors exclusive access to private sales so they can reap the highest returns from these offerings. At its discounted price of $0.0034677, $MIND could deliver sizable gains to early buyers. The success of its presale event, which has raised $7.1 million in just a couple of months, evidences the market’s growing appetite for AI agent tokens. To buy $MIND, simply head to the official MIND of Pepe website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap ETH, USDT, or BNB tokens or use a bank card to make your investment.

Examining Fetch.ai (FET) , NEAR Protocol , and Render (RENDER) , the article dives into a long-term price analysis to identify which tokens might see substantial growth. Stay tuned for insights that could shape your investment strategies. FET Price Trends and Key Levels in a Bearish Market FET experienced a decline of 22.46% over the last month and dropped 42.68% in the past six months. A one-week slide of 6.86% adds to the downward pressure seen in recent performance. Past moves have shown consistent weakness with prices trending lower over these periods. Current price trades between $0.48 and $0.94 with immediate resistance at $1.22 and support near $0.31. Bears seem to hold sway as indicators like the RSI near 37.70 and slight negative momentum point to continued pressure. Trading strategies may focus on a potential bounce from support or waiting for signs of a reversal above the resistance level. NEAR Protocol Price Snapshot Amid Recent Downturn Last month showed an 11.55% dip in price, with an 18.11% decline over the past six months. The price has trended downward consistently, reflecting prolonged pressure despite minor fluctuations. Over the past week, a modest drop of 1.63% highlights ongoing weakness in price action. Historical movements demonstrate an overall lack of strength, suggesting caution among traders. Current price trades between $2.31 and $4.25, with immediate support at $1.55 and resistance near $5.44. Bearish pressure dominates as momentum and trend indicators point lower. A sideways market has emerged, showing no clear trend. Traders might consider making quick plays around these key levels while maintaining tight stops to manage risk. Coin Market Snapshot: Declines, Support & Resistance Levels in Focus The coin has faced an 18.25% decline over the past month and a 20.01% drop in the last six months, despite a small 0.96% gain this week. This performance indicates ongoing downtrends and limited market momentum. The fluctuations observed in the last half-year show a market that struggles to gain traction, with only brief recoveries in price providing temporary relief. Currently, the coin is trading within a range of $2.72 to $5.48, with support at $1.61 and resistance at $7.13, followed by $9.88. Bearish sentiment prevails, as momentum and oscillators remain negative. Traders may look for buying opportunities near the support level while monitoring for potential reversals below the resistance. Conclusion The future of FET , NEAR , and RENDER remains promising despite the current market conditions. FET's unique applications in AI make it a strong contender for growth. NEAR's focus on usability and developer experience ensures its continued evolution. RENDER's niche in graphics and VR spaces gives it distinct potential. While the hype may have settled, the foundations of these projects suggest long-term prospects remain positive. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

41291273,https://blockworks.co/news/brief-history-zk-tech,1741370400,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,A brief history of Ethereum’s relationship with ZK,https://blockworks.co/news/brief-history-zk-tech,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . It all starts with Ethereum. The L1 is too slow. Every node needs to redundantly re-execute transactions in a block to ensure validity, which limits scalability. By 2020, the Ethereum community coalesced around rollups as the scaling solution. Vitalik’s 2021 landmark blog post on rollups explains how optimistic and zk rollups can scale Ethereum. Zk rollups are technologically superior for scaling but the tech was still too expensive to use and far behind (more later). So optimistic rollups broke into the market first. Optimistic rollups assume all transactions are valid until someone challenges it with a fraud proof within a seven-day challenge period. Optimistic rollups worked, but they came with hidden costs. The challenge period meant longer transaction finality before users could withdraw funds. Locked liquidity meant capital efficiencies and a generally poorer UX, especially with chain interoperability. Meanwhile, zk was catching up. At ETHCC 2022, Polygon, zkSync and Scroll all announced zkEVMs, which enable Solidity devs to write code and prove the execution of the EVM — effectively allowing Ethereum to leverage zero knowledge technology. By 2023, zk rollups started to gain real traction. Why exactly are zk proofs better than optimistic fraud proofs? Namely because zk proofs are much smaller (~1-10 KB) compared to raw transaction data (megabytes in size). By using zk cryptography to prove Ethereum transactions, these highly compressed proofs meant lower data availability costs and better scalability. How zero knowledge works in a nutshell Though zk was taking off, proof generation was still expensive. Based on zkstats.io, the average cost to generate a zk proof in December 2023 was $80.21. Fast forward to 2025. Proof costs have dropped to $1.3 per proof, about a 98.4% improvement. What changed? Today, each of the core pieces of the zk rollup stack have been broken up. Firstly, zkVMs are here . These specialized virtual machines speed up the zk development experience and make validity proof generation more efficient. Before zkVMs, developers needed to write complex, mathematical “circuits” to prove EVM execution. I believe RISC-V zkVMs will be the fastest technology to get commoditized. There won't be almost performance differences between the each implementation. One to two years max for this to happen. — Fede’s intern 🥊 (@fede_intern) October 24, 2024 ZkVMs like SP1, RISC Zero, Nexus and OpenVM today effectively democratize zk development for all developers (C++, Rust) without zk cryptographic expertise. In the past, zkEVMs only enabled Solidity development on zk rollups. Think of zkVMs as a more general concept than zkEVMs. Second, the costs to generate proofs are going down because of market competition. Today, there are many competitive marketplaces operated by Risc Zero, Cysic , Lagrange and Succinct. Some are still in testnet, some are operational. Zk L2s are also turning to proof aggregation techniques to amortize verification costs. The way this roughly works is by batching many proofs inside of one, which makes the final proof faster to verify. These marketplaces are also permissionless, meaning anyone with a GPU rig can sign up, post a bond and generate zk proofs. Previously, zk rollups used “centralized provers,” meaning they rented GPU/FPGA hardware from Google or Amazon. Better proof systems are also constantly launching. These proof systems (examples: Groth16, Halo2-KZG, STARK, Plonk, Expander) algorithmically define the rules as to how zk proofs are constructed and verified. They’re getting better, which means zk proofs are getting smaller and faster to verify. This in turn means increased zkVM performance gains. Finally, there are zk co-processors built on top of zkVMs. These things basically allow onchain apps that do not exist in a zk execution environment to leverage the wonders of zk technology. The way it does so is by moving computation offchain, therefore running asynchronous to the blockchain’s execution. This enables apps to compute complex statistics offchain, prove it with zk, then post that proof onchain. Apps like Frax, Azuki, Etherfi and Gearbox are using Lagrange’s zk co-processor to get around the limits of the Ethereum L1. So there you have it. That’s why zk is the endgame.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Jupiter, Lightchain AI, and Near Protocol are gaining attention for their superior value over Shiba Inu as the market rebounds. Table of Contents Jupiter, Lightchain AI, and Near protocol: Stronger value offerings than SHIB Why crypto gurus are backing Lightchain AI over memecoins Lightchain AI poised for major growth as market recovers Jupiter, Lightchain AI , and Near Protocol are being touted by crypto experts as having a better value offering than Shiba Inu (SHIB) as the market bounces back. Lightchain AI has already raised over $17.1 million at a presale price of $0.006, making it a standout project in the blockchain space with its revolutionary AI and blockchain integration. While Shiba Inu has gained popularity for its meme coin status, experts believe projects like Lightchain AI offer more substantial long-term growth potential, positioning them as better investment opportunities in the crypto market’s recovery phase. As these projects continue to evolve, they could provide strong returns for investors. Jupiter, Lightchain AI, and Near protocol: Stronger value offerings than SHIB ​When comparing the value propositions of Jupiter (JUP), Lightchain AI (LCAI), and Near Protocol (NEAR) to that of Shiba Inu, several distinctions emerge.​ Jupiter Jupiter (JUP) serves as a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator within the Solana ecosystem, optimizing token swaps by analyzing prices and liquidity across multiple DEXs. Its native token, JUP, facilitates governance and rewards within the platform. Recent developments, such as the commitment of 50% of protocol fees to buy back JUP tokens for long-term reserves, aim to enhance token value and ecosystem stability. ​ Lightchain AI Lightchain AI integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, offering scalable and efficient solutions for decentralized applications (dApps). Its Proof-of-Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) are designed to improve transaction speeds and computational efficiency. The platform’s focus on real-world applications, particularly in sectors like healthcare and finance, positions it as a promising player in the AI-blockchain space. Near Protocol Near Protocol (NEAR) is a scalable blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications. It utilizes a sharded architecture to enhance scalability and transaction speed, aiming to provide a user-friendly platform for developers and users alike. NEAR’s focus on usability and scalability has garnered significant attention within the blockchain community.​ Shiba Inu Initially launched as a meme coin, SHIB has gained popularity but lacks the technological infrastructure and real-world utility found in projects like Jupiter, Lightchain AI, and Near Protocol. While it has a large community, its value proposition is primarily driven by speculative trading rather than technological solutions.​ Jupiter, Lightchain AI, and Near Protocol offer more robust technological frameworks and real-world applications compared to Shiba Inu, which is predominantly driven by speculative interest. Investors seeking projects with substantial technological foundations and utility may find Jupiter, Lightchain AI, and Near Protocol to be more aligned with their investment criteria. Why crypto gurus are backing Lightchain AI over memecoins Crypto gurus are backing Lightchain AI over memecoins due to its strong technological foundation and long-term growth potential. Unlike memecoins, which rely on hype, Lightchain AI offers tangible value with its AI-powered blockchain solutions. The platform’s tokenomics is designed for sustainability, with a total supply of 10 billion LCAI tokens. Key allocations include 40% for presale, 28.5% for staking rewards, 15% for liquidity, 6.5% for the treasury, and 5% each for marketing and the team. The roadmap includes key milestones, such as the mainnet launch in 2025 and cross-chain integration. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s low latency ensures fast and efficient AI task execution, making it ideal for real-time applications. With decentralized governance and a growing ecosystem, Lightchain AI presents a promising, scalable alternative to memecoins, making it a favorite among seasoned investors. Lightchain AI poised for major growth as market recovers ​Lightchain AI is experiencing significant growth, having raised over $ 17.1 million during its presale at $0.006 per token. This surge in investment highlights the market’s confidence in its AI-driven blockchain solutions. Analysts predict that as the market recovers, Lightchain AI could achieve remarkable valuations, with some forecasts suggesting a 100x increase in 2025. Its unique integration of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology positions it for substantial expansion in the evolving crypto landscape. Interested investors wouldn’t want to miss this opportunity for massive gains. For more information on Lightchain AI, visit its website , X , or Telegram .

33767162,[object Object],1741370428,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Realized HODL Waves Signals Strong Market Confidence – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-realized-hodl-waves-signals-strong-market-confidence-details/,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, according to a post on X by White House Crypto and AI czar David Sacks. The announcement was expected to boost market confidence, but instead, Bitcoin fell as the order details disappointed investors who had anticipated a more bullish stance from the administration. Bitcoin has been struggling around the $90,000 level, unable to reclaim it as support or confirm a recovery from the selling pressure that has dominated the market in recent weeks. Despite several attempts to push higher, BTC has remained in a volatile range, with uncertainty keeping traders cautious. Key on-chain data from CryptoQuant reveals that the Realized Cap HODL Waves chart shows a substantial portion of Bitcoin is currently concentrated in the 3–6 month holding range. This suggests that many investors who entered the market recently are still holding onto their coins, despite the volatility. With Bitcoin failing to break key resistance , traders are watching for a decisive move—either a breakout above $90K or a deeper correction. The next few days will be crucial in determining BTC’s short-term trajectory as uncertainty continues to dominate the market. Bitcoin Shows Signs Of Recovery Amid Volatility Bitcoin is struggling to reclaim the $90,000 mark but continues to hold firm above $85,000, a critical support level that could serve as a decisive point of inflection if bulls fail to defend it. With BTC trapped in a volatile range, a break below $85K could trigger a deeper correction, while a reclaim of $90K could signal renewed strength and a push toward higher levels. The decline in cryptocurrencies closely mirrors the downtrend in U.S. stock markets as investors react to fears of a widening global trade war and broader economic instability. However, this turbulence could fade if upcoming policy decisions—such as tax cuts, regulatory clarity, and institutional incentives—provide tangible benefits for investors. If confidence returns, Bitcoin could stage a strong recovery and move toward new all-time highs. Top analyst Axel Adler shared insights on X , pointing to on-chain data from the Realized Cap HODL Waves chart, which reveals that a significant portion of Bitcoin is currently concentrated in the 3–6 month holding range. Adler notes that historically, the longer coins remain “locked in” by investors, the stronger market confidence becomes. This suggests that many recent buyers are holding firm despite volatility, reinforcing the notion that Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains strong. With market sentiment still mixed, traders are watching whether BTC can hold $85K and push higher or risk another leg down. The next few days will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin can reclaim key resistance levels or if further downside awaits. BTC Bulls Face A Critical Test Bitcoin is currently trading at $89,000, facing persistent selling pressure as bulls struggle to regain control of key levels. Despite multiple attempts to push higher, BTC remains uncertain, unable to confirm a move into higher supply zones or a deeper drop into lower demand levels. For bulls to reclaim momentum, Bitcoin must break above $90,000 with strength and quickly aim for a move toward $100,000. A decisive reclaim of these levels would signal renewed buying interest and trigger a strong rally. However, BTC remains at risk of continued sideways action or another sell-off without a clear breakout. If Bitcoin fails to reclaim $90K and loses support at $85K, the market could see another leg down, with $78,000 emerging as the next key target. This would indicate increased selling pressure and potential panic selling, forcing BTC into a deeper correction. For now, uncertainty continues to dominate, leaving traders watching whether BTC will hold above $85K or break higher. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin reclaims strength or faces another wave of downside pressure.

Hedera Gains 5% as Volume Surges Past $650M,https://cryptonews.com/news/10-hbar-incoming-hedera-gains-5-as-volume-hits-650m/,"While other leading altcoins buckled this week, HBAR is gearing up to be March’s best performer, like Sonic was in the February altcoin report . It has held firm against broader economic pressures—such as US President Trump’s “tariff war” and NATO tensions—maintaining a strong 25% gain for the week. It is this resilience that is fuelling speculation that a $10 target could be within reach. HBAR Price Analysis: Is a $10 Hadera Imminent? Its potential is most apparent with the breakout of a falling wedge pattern that has been forming since mid-December. HBAR / USDT 1D chart, symmetrical triangle pattern. Source: Binance. While $10 remains a distant goal, this move lays the groundwork. Much of its projected upside has played out, but the pattern still sets a target of $0.36—a potential 50% gain from current levels. It has promising staying power, especially as technical indicators favor the bulls. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reset to a neutral 52 after nearing overbought territory at 70, while the MACD line remains in an uptrend above the signal line—both signs of dominant buying pressure. This forms a solid foundation for growth, though consolidation may be the next move with the 50SMA presenting a strong overhead barrier to the 20SMA supports rebound attempts. If buying pressure persists into the weekend, this barrier could be broken. Hadera Might Not Be the Best Play this Bull Cycle Those who jumped to HBAR as an alternative Layer-1 to Solana (SOL) may need to reconsider— Solaxy ($SOLX) has solved the Solana Network’s biggest limitation: scalability. Post-inauguration “meme coin mania” has made the Solana network a goldmine for 10-100x meme coin opportunities , but the trading volume it brings has taken a toll. As any user would know, failed transactions are the platform’s biggest gripe. Solaxy heeds the answer to this call, all the while riding its tailwinds. Unlike Ethereum, which boasts several Layer-2 options, Solana has long lacked this capability—until now. By processing transactions off-chain and finalizing them on Solana, Solaxy significantly reduces congestion, lowers transaction costs, and enables seamless interoperability between blockchains. With over $25 million raised in its ongoing presale, the project is already gaining strong momentum—potentially credited to its 162% APY on staking that rewards early investors.

Liu Criticizes SIMD-228 In a lengthy thread on X, Liu argued that the proposal could negatively impact SOL at a crucial stage of its development. She stressed that the blockchain and its assets are deeply interconnected, and changes to its economics must consider the broader implications. According to her, for a major economic policy, network engineers rather than asset managers have dominated discussions, leading to an imbalanced perspective. She further defended Solana’s fixed-rate yields, which SIMD-228 is looking to change, arguing that it provides predictability, a key factor for institutional investors. “Fixed rates are not “dumb and arbitrary”; they’re predictable,” Liu wrote. “In capital markets, predictability is valuable,” she added, citing the success of Solana’s staked exchange-traded products (ETPs) in Europe as proof of the importance of stability. Dynamic pricing, a feature of the new proposal, might optimize network security, but in Liu’s opinion, this could come at the cost of destabilizing the value of SOL. She warned that changing the asset’s characteristics could reduce buy-and-hold pressure, undermining its growth. The executive also highlighted Solana’s trajectory, fueled by its staking ecosystem. “Big Beautiful Yield is also an ecosystem growth budget,” she noted, stating it had enabled unique crypto-native products like Payfi. Additionally, she shared her concern that given that SIMD-228 originated from venture capital proposals, its adoption could ignite worries about Solana being controlled by a select few after it only recently shook off criticisms of centralization. Yakovenko’s Response However, not everyone agrees with Liu’s position. Yakovenko expressed support for her but differed with her stance on the proposal: “Lily is awesome and has my full support and confidence even though I disagree with her on this issue.” “Steel sharpens steel,” the Solana co-founder added, affirming the importance of healthy debate. Meanwhile, Chris Burniske, a partner at VC firm Placeholder, has argued that SIMD-228 is a necessary step toward a more mature economic model for Solana. “I’m in favor of SIMD-228. In the long run, real yield comes from what the demand-side leaks to the supply-side, and inflation is just a bootstrapping mechanism to get to that place,” he stated. At the time of writing, SOL is down just over 3% in the last 24 hours. The token is one of the major digital assets name-dropped to be part of a U.S. strategic digital asset stockpile. An announcement on Thursday by White House crypto advisor David Sacks that President Donald Trump had signed an executive order creating the stockpile caused the market to tank , losing at least $200 million.

Nasdaq, a leading global exchange, is poised to make a groundbreaking move by introducing 24-hour trading. This significant development, announced on X, signals a major shift in how markets operate and could have profound implications, especially for the burgeoning crypto market and the popular Bitcoin ETFs listed on the exchange. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the future of trading. What’s the Buzz About Nasdaq’s 24/7 Trading? Nasdaq, the second-largest stock exchange in the United States, has officially declared its intention to launch 24-hour trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. This is not just a minor tweak; it’s a fundamental change in market operations. Currently, traditional stock exchanges operate during standard business hours, typically from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. ET. Moving to a 24/7 model means that trading will be possible around the clock, every day of the week. This announcement has sent ripples through the financial world, particularly within the crypto market , given Nasdaq’s involvement with Bitcoin ETFs . For context, several spot Bitcoin ETFs are already listed on Nasdaq, including industry giants like BlackRock’s IBIT, Bitwise’s BITB, and Valkyrie’s BRRR. The presence of these crypto-based investment products on a major exchange like Nasdaq already signified a growing acceptance of digital assets within mainstream finance. Now, with the introduction of 24/7 trading , Nasdaq is taking another giant leap, potentially bridging the gap between traditional stock markets and the always-on nature of the crypto market . Why Embrace 24/7 Trading? The Benefits Unveiled The decision to move to 24/7 trading is not arbitrary. It’s driven by several compelling factors, each aimed at enhancing market efficiency and investor access. Let’s explore the key benefits: Increased Accessibility for Global Investors: Traditional market hours are geographically restrictive. Investors in Asia or Europe, for instance, often have to trade outside of their local business hours to participate in the U.S. markets. 24/7 trading eliminates this barrier, allowing investors from any time zone to trade at their convenience. This democratization of access is a significant advantage, especially in the increasingly globalized financial landscape. Responsiveness to Global News and Events: In today’s interconnected world, news breaks around the clock. Market-moving events can happen at any time, whether it’s an economic announcement from Asia in the middle of the U.S. night or a geopolitical event unfolding during European trading hours. With 24/7 trading , markets can react to these events in real-time, ensuring prices reflect the most current information. This reduces the risk of overnight gaps and allows for more efficient price discovery. Catering to the Crypto Generation: The crypto market never sleeps. It operates 24/7, 365 days a year. This always-on nature is a core characteristic of digital assets and is something crypto investors are accustomed to. By introducing 24/7 trading , Nasdaq is aligning itself with the operational norms of the crypto market , potentially attracting more crypto-savvy investors to its platform and making it a more appealing venue for listing crypto-related products. Enhanced Liquidity and Tighter Spreads: Extended trading hours can contribute to increased trading volume over time, potentially leading to greater liquidity. Higher liquidity typically translates to tighter bid-ask spreads, making trading more cost-effective for investors. While liquidity might be thinner during off-peak hours initially, as adoption grows, 24/7 trading could foster a more liquid and efficient market environment. Competitive Edge: In the fiercely competitive world of exchanges, innovation is key to attracting listings and trading volume. By pioneering 24/7 trading , Nasdaq is positioning itself as a forward-thinking exchange that is responsive to the evolving needs of the market and its participants. This move could give Nasdaq a competitive edge over exchanges that adhere to traditional trading hours. Navigating the Challenges: What are the Potential Hurdles? While the benefits of 24/7 trading are compelling, implementing such a significant change is not without its challenges. It’s crucial to consider the potential hurdles Nasdaq and market participants might face: Liquidity Fragmentation: Initially, liquidity might be fragmented across the 24-hour trading day. Trading volume is likely to be concentrated during traditional market hours, with potentially thinner volumes during overnight and weekend sessions. Ensuring sufficient liquidity across all hours will be critical for the success of 24/7 trading . Market makers and liquidity providers will need to adapt their strategies to provide continuous liquidity. Operational and Technological Demands: Running a stock market 24/7 requires robust operational and technological infrastructure. Exchanges and brokerage firms will need to ensure their systems can handle continuous trading, clearing, and settlement processes without interruption. This necessitates significant investment in technology and operational support to maintain system stability and security around the clock. Regulatory and Compliance Considerations: Extending trading hours may raise new regulatory and compliance questions. Regulators will need to adapt their oversight frameworks to ensure market integrity and investor protection in a 24/7 trading environment. Issues such as market surveillance, order routing, and best execution will need to be addressed in the context of round-the-clock operations. Staffing and Human Resources: Operating 24/7 requires significant staffing adjustments. Exchanges, brokerage firms, and other market participants will need to implement shift work and ensure adequate staffing levels to support continuous operations. This can lead to increased operational costs and require careful human resource management. Investor Readiness and Education: Investors, particularly retail investors, will need to adapt to the concept of 24/7 trading . Education will be crucial to ensure investors understand the implications of trading outside of traditional hours, including potential liquidity differences and the need for continuous monitoring of their positions. Brokerage platforms will need to provide tools and resources to help investors navigate the 24/7 trading environment effectively. Bitcoin ETFs and 24/7 Nasdaq: A Powerful Synergy? The introduction of 24/7 trading by Nasdaq is particularly noteworthy given the presence of spot Bitcoin ETFs on its platform. These ETFs, including BlackRock’s IBIT, Bitwise’s BITB, and Valkyrie’s BRRR, provide traditional investors with exposure to Bitcoin within a regulated and familiar investment vehicle. The move to 24/7 trading could amplify the appeal and accessibility of these Bitcoin ETFs in several ways: Enhanced Trading Flexibility for Bitcoin ETF Investors: Currently, trading of Bitcoin ETFs on Nasdaq is limited to standard market hours. With 24/7 trading , investors will have the flexibility to trade these ETFs at any time, aligning with the always-on nature of the underlying Bitcoin market. This is particularly beneficial for investors who want to react to crypto market movements that occur outside of traditional stock market hours. Bridging Traditional Finance and Crypto: 24/7 trading on Nasdaq can further bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto market . By adopting a 24/7 operational model, Nasdaq is signaling its commitment to accommodating the needs of the crypto market and its investors. This could encourage further integration of digital assets into mainstream financial markets. Potential for Increased Trading Volume in Bitcoin ETFs: The increased accessibility and trading hours could lead to higher trading volumes in Bitcoin ETFs listed on Nasdaq. Investors who were previously constrained by traditional market hours may now be able to trade more actively, potentially boosting liquidity and market depth for these products. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights Nasdaq’s move towards 24/7 trading is a significant development with implications for various market participants. Here are some actionable insights to consider: For Crypto Investors: If you are already active in the crypto market , Nasdaq’s 24/7 trading could make Bitcoin ETFs an even more attractive option. You will have the flexibility to trade these ETFs around the clock, similar to trading Bitcoin directly. Keep an eye on how liquidity develops during off-peak hours and adjust your trading strategies accordingly. For Traditional Stock Market Investors: 24/7 trading on Nasdaq could present new opportunities and challenges. Be prepared to monitor market developments outside of traditional hours and consider how global news events might impact your portfolio overnight. Evaluate if extended trading hours align with your investment strategy and risk tolerance. For Traders: 24/7 trading can create more trading opportunities but also demands increased vigilance.

41293415,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=138113,1741374339,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Mysterious Whale Alert: Massive 106,569 ETH Transfer from Kraken Sparks Crypto Speculation",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/mysterious-whale-eth-kraken-transfer/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, large transactions often send ripples through the market, sparking curiosity and speculation alike. Recently, a significant movement of Ethereum (ETH) has caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts and analysts. Whale Alert, a service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions, reported a massive transfer of 106,569 ETH from the well-known cryptocurrency exchange, Kraken, to an unknown wallet. Valued at approximately $238 million at the time of the transaction, this substantial ETH transfer has ignited discussions within the crypto community. Let’s dive into the details of this intriguing event and explore what it might signify. What Happened? Decoding the Massive ETH Transfer On [Insert Date of Report], Whale Alert, a prominent tracker of large crypto transactions, sent out an alert detailing a significant ETH transfer . According to their report, 106,569 ETH was moved from a wallet associated with the Kraken exchange to an unknown wallet. Here’s a breakdown of the key details: Amount Transferred: 106,569 ETH Origin: Kraken Exchange Destination: Unknown Wallet Value: Approximately $238 million (at the time of transaction) Report Source: Whale Alert This substantial transaction immediately raises several questions. Who is behind this massive transfer? What are their intentions? And what could be the potential impact on the cryptocurrency market? Why Kraken? Understanding the Source of the ETH Transfer Kraken is a leading cryptocurrency exchange, known for its robust security measures and wide range of trading options. Transfers from exchanges like Kraken are common, but a transaction of this magnitude is certainly noteworthy. Here are a few potential reasons why such a large amount of ETH might be moved from Kraken : Institutional Investment: Large financial institutions or funds might be accumulating ETH, and withdrawing it from exchanges to cold storage for long-term holding. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: High-net-worth individuals or institutions often use OTC desks associated with exchanges like Kraken to execute large trades privately. This transfer could be a part of an OTC deal settlement. Strategic Rebalancing: Kraken itself might be rebalancing its wallet holdings for operational or security reasons. Exchanges need to manage their crypto reserves efficiently. Whale Activity: A “whale” in crypto terms refers to an individual or entity holding a large amount of cryptocurrency. This transaction could simply be a whale moving their assets for personal portfolio management. Unknown Wallet: The Mystery Deepens The destination of this ETH transfer is an “unknown wallet,” which adds an element of mystery to the situation. In the world of blockchain, wallets are identified by their addresses, which are pseudonymous. While transactions are public and traceable on the blockchain, the real-world identity behind a wallet address is often unknown. An unknown wallet could belong to: Another Exchange or Custodian: The ETH might be moving to another exchange for listing, or to a custodial service for secure storage. Private Wallet: It could be a personal hardware or software wallet controlled by an individual or institution seeking to hold the ETH outside of exchange custody for enhanced security or long-term investment strategies. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Platform: The funds might be moved to participate in DeFi protocols for staking, lending, or yield farming. Institutional Custody Solution: Many institutions utilize specialized custody solutions that involve moving assets to secure, often offline, wallets. Whale Alert: Shining a Light on Crypto Movements Services like Whale Alert play a crucial role in providing transparency in the often opaque world of cryptocurrency transactions. By tracking and reporting large transfers, Whale Alert helps the community stay informed about significant market movements. This information can be valuable for: Market Monitoring: Traders and analysts use Whale Alert data to monitor large transactions that could potentially impact market prices. Security Awareness: Tracking large movements can sometimes help in identifying suspicious activities or potential market manipulation. Understanding Investor Behavior: Observing whale transactions can offer insights into the behavior of large crypto holders and their strategies. However, it’s important to remember that while Whale Alert provides valuable data, it only reports on on-chain transactions. The reasons behind these transactions often remain speculative without further context. Impact on the Cryptocurrency Market: Speculation and Potential Outcomes A massive ETH transfer like this inevitably leads to speculation about its potential impact on the broader cryptocurrency market. While it’s impossible to predict the exact consequences, here are some potential scenarios: Bullish Signal: If the ETH is moving into long-term storage or institutional custody, it could be interpreted as a bullish signal, indicating strong confidence in Ethereum’s future. Neutral Event: The transfer might be a routine operational movement or part of an OTC deal with no significant market impact. Bearish Signal (Less Likely): In some scenarios, very large exchange outflows could precede selling pressure, but this is less likely in this case as the destination is an unknown wallet, not necessarily another exchange for immediate selling. Ultimately, the true impact of this ETH transfer will unfold over time. Market participants will be watching closely for any further movements from the unknown wallet and broader market reactions. Key Takeaways: What Does This Mysterious Transfer Mean for You? While the exact purpose of this 106,569 ETH transfer remains shrouded in mystery, it highlights several important aspects of the cryptocurrency world: Large Transactions are Common: Significant crypto movements happen frequently, underscoring the dynamic nature of the market. Transparency and Anonymity: Blockchain provides transaction transparency, but real-world identities often remain hidden. Whale Activity Matters: Actions of large holders can influence market sentiment and price movements. Stay Informed: Following services like Whale Alert and staying updated on crypto news can provide valuable insights. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, monitoring these large transactions and understanding their potential implications is crucial for anyone involved in this exciting and often unpredictable market. Keep an eye on further developments and always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions based on such events.

Q4 generated positive net income. For the full year, the company lost $44.6 million and had an estimated breakeven cost of nearly $94k. Four months of that production came pre-halving. 'Sats per share' backing CIFR stock, while up year over year, have fallen considerably over the last two quarters. More than 300 BTC have been subsequently sold since EOY. SoftBank's $50 million cash infusion in January came via dilution and those shares have already been registered for sale. However, hedge fund balances were higher in Q4. A lot has happened since I last covered Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) for Seeking Alpha in September. As an asset, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has been very present in the zeitgeist. First with President Trump's Truth Social posts from March 2nd and then with the Trump administration 'delivering' on its campaign promise to order the ceased selling of BTC held by the US government. While market speculators and HODLers were likely looking for something more similar to the Lummis/RJK Jr proposals from last summer, the reality is such a move was always an overly optimistic expectation - at least this year. We can let the KOLs on X who have made Bitcoin their entire personal identity debate whether the President's March 6th executive order was bullish enough for price today. As investors, we need to dissect the information as best we can and allocate capital accordingly. And while a lot has happened since September, I'm not sure much as actually changed for Bitcoin. Miners are perhaps a different story. When I wrote about CIFR last year, Cipher had a large cash hoard and the sixth largest BTC stack among public mining stocks. Neither of which are still true. Q4 Earnings & Balance Sheet For the quarter ended December, Cipher Mining reported top line revenue of $42.2 million. This was a large sequential increase from $24.1 million in Q3 and a relatively small decline from $43.4 million year over year. Importantly, Cipher's $17.5 million net income in the quarter wasn't entirely attributable to revaluing unrealized gains on Bitcoin holdings. That's the good news. Periods Ended December (Cipher Mining) For the full year, Cipher Mining's operating loss came in at $43.7 million. This was more than double the operating loss from 2023 even with Bitcoin prices significantly higher for all of 2024. After interest income, interest expense, and taxes, Cipher Mining ended 2024 with a $44.6 million net loss. Cipher Mining Given the 2,756 BTC the company mined during the calendar year, at $258 million in COGS, Comp, G&A, and D&A, Cipher would have needed a $93.7k average selling price on BTC mined for the company to have broken even. That's actually not a bad breakeven price all things considered, but bear in mind that nearly half of the company's mined BTC from the full year came in the first four months before the block reward halving event in April. This same expense profile in a full year post halving world would put Cipher's break even price above $100k BTC. Which is certainly attainable at current Bitcoin pricing but at the moment, the company can't operate profitably without cutting costs. The question is how much room for error does Cipher have? I suspect not very much. Data by YCharts At the end of December, Cipher Mining had less than $6 million in cash and equivalents against $173.5 million in total liabilities. To be sure, assets also grew substantially year over year from $566 million to $855 million. This growth in assets was attributable to a near-doubling of property and equipment as well as an almost $60 million YoY increase in the value of Cipher's Bitcoin holdings. To be sure, this growth in assets has come at a cost and that cost has generally been through shareholder dilution. Cipher, Seeking Alpha, Author's Chart By my count, Cipher Mining's 'sats per share' has been in decline since quarter ended June and currently stands at its lowest level since December 2023. The good thing for those who like miners to keep BTC on the balance sheet is that 'sats per share' has indeed grown year over year by nearly 40%. I'm not expecting this to continue to be quite honest. Febru ary Production Like all miners, Cipher is enduring diminishing BTC-denominated returns from mining: Cipher, Author's Chart This is both a product of the block reward halving last April as well as increased global hash rate chasing Bitcoin's price increase. Over the last three reported production months (Dec-Feb), Cipher's average monthly BTC haul has been 211 BTC. Given the company's plans for exahash growth through the rest of the year, it's not a surprise to see Cipher's HODL stack has declined each of the last 6 months: Cipher, Author's Chart Cipher's HODL now stands at 1,032 BTC - 392 of which have been pledged as collateral. After Bitcoin's price topped out during the 2021 bull run, it was not unusual to see public miners that had scaled stacks during the run start to sell BTC off when cash flow got tight. That may or may not be at play here for Cipher, but it's useful nonetheless for readers who prioritize a 'BTC yield.' That's not a viable play any longer for CIFR in my view. Valuation The other consideration is valuation. I've shared this table before in additional Bitcoin mining articles and I'll do so again here: CIFR Market Capitalization $1,318,185,105 Monthly Production 211 FWD P/S At $85k BTC 6.12 FWD P/S At $100k BTC 5.21 FWD P/S At $150k BTC 3.47 FWD P/S At $200k BTC 2.60 Sources: Cipher, Google Finance, Author's Calculations At 211 monthly BTC, Cipher is trading at an annualized price to sales ratio of 5.2 given a $100k BTC price. That multiple is over 6x forward sales at the currently closer $85k per coin price. Cipher's revenue comes from mining. Even though the company aspires for HPC revenue - something that I believe is more challenging now than it was a year ago - I think valuing these companies on Bitcoin-based assets and Bitcoin-based revenue is the better approach today. Data by YCharts On a price to book multiple, CIFR is valued closer to companies like MARA Holdings ( MARA ) and CleanSpark ( CLSK ) than it is to a company like TeraWulf ( WULF ). Share Registration and Holdings Data One of the risks that I pointed out back in September was that insiders were selling CIFR stock to a fairly significant degree. In the first half of September, BitFury (a 10% owner) sold $27.9 million in CIFR stock. Since then, that selling has subsided a bit with $18.1 million in combined sales from BitFury and two executives in the subsequent months. In late-February, Cipher Mining released a filing indicating a SoftBank subsidiary had purchased 10.4 million shares for $50 million and registered those shares for sale: Cipher Minining Given these shares were purchased at $4.79 - a 21% premium to the March 6th closing price - I don't imagine these 10.4 million shares are an immediate risk to be sold. Doing so would realize a $10.4 million loss in just a handful of weeks - again, it's unlikely these get moved immediately in my eyes. What's also interesting is the growth we've seen in mining stock shares held by asset managers over the last two quarters. Shares Held By Hedge Funds (millions) Q2-24 Q3-24 Q4-24 QoQ Core Scientific ( CORZ ) 88.59 110.84 141.54 27.7% Cipher Mining 58.26 62.06 76.50 23.3% CleanSpark 66.45 70.41 83.63 18.8% MARA Holdings 114.63 113.01 129.31 14.4% Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) 89.12 86.35 134.95 56.3% IREN Ltd. ( IREN ) 50.47 26.67 38.01 42.5% Source: Hedge Follow While Cipher's institutional ownership is slightly below most of the other stocks listed in the table above, CIFR shares held by hedge funds (as tracked by Hedge Follow) grew faster than the sector average of 21% in the fourth quarter. By itself, this is not necessarily a reason to go long or short the stock since it is lagging data, but I do think it's interesting and noteworthy nonetheless. Do with it what you will. Closing Thoughts I think the primary signals here that CIFR shareholders and prospective buyers should pay attention to are pretty simple; Cipher's break even cost last year wasn't actually all that bad and it still couldn't find a way to run a profitable business. Revenue generation isn't going to get any easier in 2025 with higher hash rate and diminishing BTC-denominated returns. Transaction fees in February were abysmal and can't reasonably be relied on for incremental revenue growth any time soon. The company had very little cash at the end of last year, has had to raise capital from uncommitted investors like SoftBank, and has been selling down it's BTC stack. I'm not going to call CIFR a 'sell,' but I think there are better opportunities out there.",BTC-USD|CLSK|WULF|CIFR,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-07 19:06:01

Don’t Make the Same Mistake Again with This Best Crypto Presale to Join!,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-monero-at-0-25-dont-make-the-same-mistake-again-with-this-best-crypto-presale-to-join/,"Crypto history is full of painful “what if” moments. Every cycle, there are those who scooped up early-stage projects for pennies and watched them soar, and then there are those who kick themselves for missing out. Imagine being one of the lucky few who bought Bitcoin when it was trading under a dollar, or Ethereum when it was under $10. But perhaps one of the most painful missed opportunities of all time is Monero (XMR). Monero launched in 2014 with little fanfare. Privacy coins weren’t a hot topic back then, and most people were too fixated on Bitcoin to pay attention to the small but promising new project. At the time, Monero traded for mere cents, later stabilizing around $0.25. Back then, there were skeptics, as with every emerging crypto, dismissing it as just another “Bitcoin clone.” Fast forward a few years, and Monero surged past $400 at its peak. That means those who grabbed Monero at $0.25 saw gains of over 160,000% at the top. To put that into perspective, a $1,000 investment in Monero in its early days could have turned into over $1.6 million. This isn’t just a one-time fluke either—Monero remains one of the top privacy-focused cryptocurrencies in the market, proving that early-stage projects often hold massive potential. But here’s the real kicker: history keeps repeating itself. Every cycle, there’s another Monero, another Bitcoin, another Ethereum that people overlook—until it’s too late. The question isn’t whether there will be another best crypto presale to join ; it’s whether you’ll recognize it before it explodes. Qubetics ($TICS): The New Frontier in Multi-Chain Wallets If you missed Monero’s early days, the crypto market is offering another chance—one that’s shaping up to be one of the most exciting presales of 2025. Qubetics ($TICS) is emerging as one of the best crypto presales to join right now, with a cutting-edge multi-chain wallet solution that could redefine how users interact with blockchain networks. The problem with today’s crypto wallets is that most of them only support a handful of blockchains. Even the big names in non-custodial wallets, like MetaMask and Trust Wallet, have limitations. Users are forced to juggle multiple wallets, deal with endless network compatibility issues, and suffer from slow, clunky user experiences. Qubetics is stepping in to solve these problems by offering a next-gen multi-chain wallet that unifies leading blockchains into a single seamless ecosystem. Imagine holding Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and other top cryptos in a single wallet, with no need to worry about swapping networks or dealing with multiple interfaces. Qubetics is designed for seamless cross-chain transactions, eliminating barriers that frustrate traders, DeFi users, and NFT collectors alike. Security is also a major focus. With non-custodial control, top-tier encryption, and built-in cross-chain interoperability, Qubetics is building a powerhouse for digital asset management. Given how fragmented the current Web3 landscape is, this could be a game-changer for both retail and institutional crypto users. Qubetics Presale: The Best Crypto Presale to Join Before Prices Surge There’s nothing like getting in early. Right now, Qubetics’ presale is in Stage 24, with a token price of $0.0976. Over $14.6 million has already been raised, with more than 496 million $TICS tokens sold, showing massive demand for the project before it even hits the open market. But here’s where things get really interesting. Unlike Monero, where early adopters had to wait years to see exponential returns, Qubetics already has clear price projections, and they look nothing short of explosive. At the end of the presale, the token is projected to hit $0.25, which would already deliver a 155.93% ROI. But that’s just the beginning. Analysts predict that after the presale, $TICS could soar to $1, translating into a 923.72% return. The numbers only get crazier from there: $5 per TICS? That’s a 5,018.58% ROI. $10 per TICS post-mainnet launch? That’s a mind-blowing 10,137.16% ROI. A $15 price target? That would mean an eye-watering 15,255.75% return. For context, a $1,000 investment at today’s price could turn into over $100,000 if Qubetics reaches $10 per token. If $TICS hits $15, that same $1,000 investment would be worth over $150,000. It’s easy to look back on Monero and wonder, “What if I had gotten in early?” But crypto isn’t about dwelling on missed opportunities—it’s about recognizing the next big one before it happens. Why This Could Be the Last Chance to Join Qubetics at Low Prices Timing is everything in crypto, and Qubetics isn’t going to stay at $0.0976 for long. The project is structured so that each presale stage lasts only 7 days, and every Sunday at 12 AM, the price increases by 10%. That means the longer you wait, the higher the entry price. And with the Qubetics mainnet launch scheduled for Q2 2025, early buyers are positioning themselves for what could be one of the biggest blockchain events of the year. With adoption growing and Web3 moving towards cross-chain compatibility, a multi-chain wallet like Qubetics is the kind of solution that could see massive demand in the coming years. History shows that the best gains come to those who act before the rest of the market catches on. Monero’s early adopters saw life-changing profits because they saw the vision before privacy coins became mainstream. Qubetics is doing the same for blockchain interoperability, and the numbers suggest that this could be the best crypto presale to join in 2025. Final Thoughts: Will You Be the One Who Got In Early? Every cycle, a new crypto project emerges that rewards those who got in early. Monero was once an unknown privacy coin trading for pennies. Fast forward a few years, and it became a dominant player in blockchain privacy, reaching over $400 per token at its peak. Now, Qubetics is offering a similar early-stage opportunity—one that could revolutionize how users interact with multiple blockchains. Its multi-chain wallet, seamless interoperability, and cross-border transaction capabilities make it a standout in the Web3 space. With the presale price set to rise every week and a massive ROI potential, the question isn’t whether Qubetics will take off—it’s whether you’ll be part of it before it does. The best opportunities in crypto don’t wait, and neither should you. Those who hesitated on Monero missed out on a 160,000% gain. Will Qubetics be the next big crypto breakout? Only time will tell—but one thing is certain: the best crypto presale to join won’t stay at these prices for long.

41293686,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=138114,1741374935,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unveiled: LastPass Breach Exposed as Culprit in Ripple Founder’s Devastating $150M Crypto Hack,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/lastpass-breach-ripple-hack/,"In a stunning revelation that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency world, the mystery behind the audacious $150 million hack of Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen has seemingly been solved. For months, the crypto community has speculated about the cause of this massive Ripple hack , and now, a new report points towards a surprising culprit: the 2022 LastPass breach . The Shocking Link: LastPass Breach and the Ripple Hack According to blockchain sleuth ZachXBT, a recent U.S. forfeiture complaint has shed light on the January 2024 incident. This complaint reportedly reveals that Larsen’s staggering loss of 283 million XRP tokens, valued at approximately $150 million at the time, originated from compromised private keys. And where were these critical keys stored? Allegedly, within the password management service LastPass, which suffered a significant security breach back in 2022. This connection, if confirmed, paints a stark picture of the potential vulnerabilities even seasoned crypto veterans can face. Until now, Chris Larsen , a prominent figure in the crypto space and co-founder of Ripple, had remained tight-lipped about the exact circumstances surrounding the theft. This silence fueled speculation and concern within the community. However, ZachXBT’s findings, based on official documentation, suggest a direct link between the LastPass breach and the XRP theft . Decoding the Timeline: How Did the LastPass Breach Lead to the Ripple Hack? To understand the gravity of this situation, let’s break down the timeline and key elements: August 2022: The LastPass Breach – LastPass, a widely used password manager, disclosed a significant security incident where hackers gained access to internal systems. While initially downplaying the severity, later reports revealed that encrypted password vaults and user data were compromised. December 2022: Escalation of LastPass Breach – LastPass confirmed that attackers had stolen encrypted password vaults. While encrypted, the possibility of brute-force attacks to decrypt these vaults raised serious concerns for users. January 2024: The Ripple Hack – News broke of a massive Ripple hack targeting wallets associated with Chris Larsen , resulting in the theft of 283 million XRP. Recent Revelation: The Forfeiture Complaint – ZachXBT’s report highlights a U.S. forfeiture complaint that explicitly links the Ripple hack to private keys originating from the LastPass breach . This timeline suggests a plausible scenario where attackers, having compromised LastPass breach user data in 2022, may have patiently worked to decrypt vaults, eventually gaining access to Chris Larsen’s private keys and executing the XRP theft in January 2024. Why is This Revelation Significant for Crypto Security? This alleged link between the LastPass breach and the Ripple hack carries significant implications for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. It underscores several critical points regarding crypto security : Password Managers are Not Impenetrable: While password managers like LastPass are designed to enhance security by generating and storing complex passwords, they are not foolproof. This incident serves as a stark reminder that even encrypted vaults can be targets and potentially compromised. Private Key Management is Paramount: The golden rule in crypto security is to control your private keys. This incident highlights the extreme risks associated with storing private keys in centralized, online services, even if they are password-protected. The Long Tail of Security Breaches: The LastPass breach occurred in 2022, yet its potential repercussions, like the Ripple hack , are surfacing much later. This demonstrates that the impact of security breaches can be long-lasting and unfold over extended periods. Due Diligence and Diversification are Key: Relying solely on one security measure, like a password manager, can create a single point of failure. Diversifying security practices and conducting thorough due diligence on all platforms and services used is crucial. Actionable Insights: Fortifying Your Crypto Security So, what can crypto users learn from this incident to enhance their own crypto security ? Here are some actionable insights: Prioritize Hardware Wallets: For storing significant amounts of cryptocurrency, hardware wallets are widely considered the most secure option. They keep private keys offline, shielded from online threats. Self-Custody is King: Embrace the principle of self-custody. Avoid storing private keys on centralized exchanges, online wallets, or password managers. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Wherever possible, enable MFA for all crypto-related accounts and services. This adds an extra layer of security beyond passwords. Regular Security Audits: Periodically review your crypto security practices. Update passwords, check for any compromised accounts, and stay informed about the latest security threats. Be Wary of Phishing and Social Engineering: Attackers often exploit human vulnerabilities. Be vigilant against phishing attempts and social engineering tactics that aim to trick you into revealing sensitive information. Is the Era of Password Managers Over for Crypto? Does this incident mean password managers are no longer viable for crypto users? Not necessarily. Password managers still offer significant benefits for managing the countless passwords we need in the digital age. However, for cryptocurrency, particularly private keys, a more robust and dedicated security approach is essential. Password managers can be used for exchange accounts and other related services, but the lesson from the Ripple hack is clear: private keys demand cold storage and self-custody solutions. A Wake-Up Call for Crypto Security The alleged link between the LastPass breach and the Ripple hack serves as a powerful wake-up call for the cryptocurrency community. It underscores the ever-present and evolving nature of cyber threats, and the critical importance of proactive and robust crypto security measures. As the digital asset landscape matures, so too must our security practices. This incident should prompt everyone in the crypto space, from seasoned veterans like Chris Larsen to newcomers, to re-evaluate their security protocols and prioritize the safeguarding of their digital assets above all else.

The discussion began when XRPL validator Vet addressed a Fox News reporter, stating that XRP is not attached to any company and should be recognized as a commodity like Bitcoin. Vet’s response directly challenges the misconception that XRP is controlled or owned by a single entity. Debate Over XRP’s Connection to Ripple Vet’s statement was met with pushback from some X users who argued that XRP is, in fact, closely tied to Ripple. A user named JAXES disagreed, asserting that XRP’s association with Ripple is undeniable, regardless of personal views. In response , Vet distinguished between the legal and practical realities of XRP’s relationship with Ripple. He acknowledged that Ripple is a significant player in the XRP ecosystem and uses the digital asset extensively but emphasized that this does not mean XRP is legally or fundamentally tied to the company. Another user, Fish Ricket, insisted that Ripple is “very much attached” to XRP. Vet clarified that while Ripple is involved with XRP, the connection does not work in both directions. In other words, while Ripple uses XRP, it is not dependent on the firm’s existence. This distinction is crucial in understanding the decentralized nature of the XRPL. XRP’s Status as a Commodity Vet’s original argument was that XRP, like Bitcoin, should be classified as a commodity. This viewpoint aligns with the position held by many within the cryptocurrency industry who argue that XRP exists independently of any company. Unlike securities, which are tied to an issuing entity, commodities are assets that operate on open markets without reliance on a single organization. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This debate over XRP’s classification has been central in regulatory discussions and legal proceedings. Ripple’s use of XRP in financial products and its substantial holdings have led to persistent misconceptions that XRP and Ripple are interchangeable. However, XRP operates on a decentralized, open-source blockchain maintained by independent validators, supporting the argument that it is not owned or controlled by Ripple. Public Perception vs. Technical Reality The discussion between Vet and other X users highlights the ongoing divide between public perception and the technical reality of XRP. While Ripple plays a major role in the XRP ecosystem , XRP’s existence and functionality do not depend on Ripple. This distinction remains a key point of contention among market participants and regulators. Vet’s argument reflects a broader effort within the XRP community to separate the digital asset from Ripple’s corporate identity. As discussions around regulation and adoption continue, the classification and independence of XRP will remain an important topic in the cryptocurrency space.

41293776,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/?p=41354,1741375058,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png,"Not Your Keys, Not Your Content: Ownership In A Digital Age",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/not-your-keys-not-your-content-ownership-in-a-digital-age,"Bitcoin Magazine Not Your Keys, Not Your Content: Ownership In A Digital Age Amazon has updated its purchasing terms for Kindle e-books in the United States to clarify that customers are acquiring a license to the content, not ownership. The new statement reads: “ By placing your order, you’re purchasing a license to the content and agree to the Kindle Store Terms of Use. ” This update is specific to U.S. customers; international users continue to see the previous wording, but the message is the same: You don’t own it; we are only letting you use it. Starting February 26, 2025, Amazon will discontinue the “ Download & Transfer via USB ” feature for Kindle devices. This means users can no longer download Kindle books directly to their computers for manual transfer, as the access to purchased content will now depend entirely on Amazon’s cloud infrastructure. This change points out a subtle truth about ownership and reinforces a simple fact: It isn’t yours if someone else can take it away. This is not just an Amazon issue but applies to all content and materials in our current digital era. Your favorite songs and albums on your streaming app cannot be accessed without an internet connection. They limit the number of devices you can listen from, and they insert ads unless you pay them a monthly fee. Gone are the days of records, tapes, and CDs having the freedom to listen however you want, resell, or even give it away to a friend. What does it mean to own something? Ownership is typically understood as the act or state of possessing something. In this case, we clearly possess the content, but it can be altered or taken away from us at any time. That is not true ownership. Oxford states ownership is defined as “The exclusive right to use, possess, and dispose of property”. So exclusivity is required in ownership. What about other intangible digital items such as money or identity? You possess your name or handle on social media or email. That is you, it is your online likeness, persona, and content that you created. You cannot have two people with the same name or handle, and that exclusivity is enforced by a password on the account, but that account can be locked, banned, or deleted at any time by the decisions of Facebook or X. What about that money in your bank account? You possess it, and you have legal rights to it, but banks freeze accounts, and governments seize funds all the time. That is not true ownership. So I ask again: What does it mean to own something? It is not enough to possess it; having exclusivity or even legal rights is not enough. To truly own something, you alone must be able to enforce that possession and exclusivity. In the physical world, enforcement largely comes down to coercion and the threat or actual use of violence. The eviction notice from the sheriff’s department, the armed guards in front of a vault, the redrawing of borders after a war. In the digital domain, encryption serves this purpose and, at the same time, removes the need for violence by making force ineffective. It creates ownership that cannot be overridden by violence. No amount of physical force can break strong cryptography. A government can seize a server, and a company can shut down an account, but if data is encrypted and the key is private, the information remains inaccessible. The only way to access encrypted assets is through consent. Encryption doesn’t just protect digital ownership; it changes the very nature of power. It removes violence from the equation. That’s why it’s so disruptive. Digital signing in encrypted systems is how you prove ownership and control in the digital world. PGP lets you sign messages and files, proving they came from you and haven’t been altered. Nostr, a decentralized social media protocol, works the same way. Your posts and identity are tied to your private key , not a company that can ban or delete you. Bitcoin exemplifies this principle. Controlling your private keys means only you can access and manage your funds. When you sign a Bitcoin transaction, only you can access and move your money. No bank can freeze it, no government can seize it without your key. True ownership is about having the power to enforce that ownership. The Bitcoin axiom “Not your keys, not your coins” comes to mind. “Not your keys, not your coins” means if you don’t control the private keys to your Bitcoin, you don’t own it. When you keep Bitcoin on an exchange, the exchange holds the keys, not you. They can freeze your account, limit withdrawals, or even lose your funds. Brokerage accounts and retirement accounts with Bitcoin ETFs can be frozen or seized the same as any bank account. True ownership means holding your keys because only then do you have full control over your money, identity, and property. The shift from physical to digital has made access easier but ownership murky. Whether it’s books, music, identity, or money, just having possession is an illusion of ownership. Companies can revoke access, governments can seize funds, and platforms can erase identities, but encryption changes that. Ownership becomes enforceable, not by laws, a corporation, or an institution, but by math. If you want true digital ownership, the rule is simple: control your keys, or someone else is the true owner. This is a guest post by Will Jager.

On the other hand, Shibarium’s stalled progress and Shiba Inu’s declining burn rate indicate that the bearish mode may persist a bit longer. The Potential Rally The second-largest meme coin registered substantial gains on a couple of occasions during this bull run. Lately, though, its price has been underperforming and stands far below the peak levels. As of this writing, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is worth roughly $0.00001349, representing an 18% decrease on a monthly scale. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko One person who touched upon the meme coin’s recent price fluctuations is the X user Ali Martinez. The analyst claimed that SHIB “is holding strong above the critical $0.000013 support,” predicting a possible 50% pump to $0.00020 “if buying pressure picks up.” It is worth noting that several hours ago, the valuation briefly dropped below the depicted zone before rising again. Another industry participant who made a bullish forecast is JAVON MARKS. Approximately a week ago, the X user maintained that SHIB keeps holding its breakout, which took place in late 2022 and early 2023. “With this price breakout holding, the target for SHIB continues to be at the $0.000081,” they added. Such a price increase would mean a 500% explosion from the current levels. The Bears Might Reign a Bit Longer Contrary to the bullish predictions of some market observers, several vital factors signal that SHIB could be headed for a further downtrend in the short term. An example is Shibarium’s stalled progress. While the layer-2 scaling solution was processing multi-million daily transactions at the start of the year, the figure has recently plummeted to 55,000. This could indicate decreased network activity, reduced user engagement, and fading interest in the ecosystem. Next on the list is Shiba Inu’s burning program, whose ultimate goal is to reduce the circulating supply of the meme coin and make it more valuable in time. Over the past seven days, the team and community have destroyed less than 90 million SHIB, meaning a 30% weekly decline. The total number of tokens sent to a dead wallet since adopting the program stands at more than 410 trillion, leaving around 584.2 trillion in circulation (which remains quite significant).

On March 8, 2025, while top assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP are witnessing price declines, PEPE has defied the market trend, registering an impressive 7.5% gain in the past 24 hours. Current Price Momentum With this impressive upside momentum, PEPE is currently trading near $0.0000073. Meanwhile, its trading volume has surged by 60% over the same period, indicating heightened anticipation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. PEPE Price Action and Upcoming Levels This price surge has pushed the meme coin to the upper boundary of its consolidation range, positioning it for a potential breakout. According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, PEPE is trading within a narrow zone between $0.0000064 and $0.00000738. However, with today’s price surge, the meme coin is on the verge of breaking out of this pattern. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if PEPE breaches this range and closes a daily candle above the $0.0000074 level, there is a strong possibility that it could soar by 40%, reaching $0.0000105 in the coming days. Despite the recent price gain, the asset is still trading below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating that it remains in a downtrend. Traders Bullish Outlook Data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass reveals that bulls are currently dominating the meme coin, as they seem to be strongly betting on the long side. PEPE’s exchange liquidation map shows that $0.00000693 and $0.00000735 are key levels where traders holding long and short positions are over-leveraged. Source: Coinglass Currently, they have $1.80 million worth of long positions and $615K worth of short positions.

A fascinating report from financial giant Standard Chartered (SC) is making waves, suggesting a potentially game-changing move by the United States. Could the U.S. government be considering selling off some of its massive gold reserves to fund a strategic Bitcoin reserve ? Let’s dive into the details of this intriguing proposition and what it could mean for the future of crypto and traditional finance. The Bitcoin Reserve Revelation: A Budget-Neutral Strategy? According to a report highlighted by The Block, Standard Chartered’s analysis delves into the implications of the recent executive order (EO) focused on Bitcoin reserve strategies. The core idea? The U.S. government is exploring ways to bolster its Bitcoin holdings without impacting the national budget. This ‘budget-neutral’ approach opens up a fascinating array of possibilities, and Standard Chartered points to one particularly noteworthy option: rebalancing assets. Executive Order Catalyst: The recent EO signals a clear intent from the U.S. government to engage with and potentially integrate digital assets into its financial strategy. Budget Neutral Mandate: The key constraint is to find a funding mechanism that doesn’t strain the existing budget. This necessitates creative solutions like asset reallocation. Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation: The goal isn’t just about dabbling in crypto; it’s about establishing a meaningful Bitcoin reserve , suggesting a long-term strategic vision. Gold Sell-Off Gambit: Funding the Bitcoin Future? Here’s where things get really interesting. Standard Chartered suggests that to achieve this budget-neutral Bitcoin reserve , the U.S. might consider selling off some of its substantial gold holdings. Let’s put this into perspective: U.S. Gold Reserves Value $760 Billion Potential Gold for Bitcoin Undisclosed portion of $760 Billion Strategic Implication Significant shift in asset allocation The U.S. government sits on a colossal $760 billion mountain of gold. Even a small percentage of this, redirected towards Bitcoin reserve acquisition, could have a massive impact on the crypto market. Is this a radical idea? Perhaps. Is it outside the realm of possibility? Standard Chartered seems to think not. Selling gold to buy Bitcoin would represent a monumental shift in how a major global power views and values assets in the 21st century. Alternative Funding Avenues: Beyond Gold and into Crypto? While the gold sell-off is a headline-grabbing possibility, Standard Chartered also highlights other potential avenues for establishing this Bitcoin reserve : Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF): The U.S. Treasury’s ESF, currently holding around $39 billion in assets, could be tapped as a source of funds. This fund is designed for currency stabilization but could potentially be repurposed. Revisiting the ‘Bitcoin Act 2024’: Senator Cynthia Lummis’s proposed ‘Bitcoin Act 2024’ aimed to purchase 200,000 BTC over five years in a budget-neutral manner. Reviving or adapting aspects of this act could provide a framework for acquisition. These alternatives suggest that the U.S. government has multiple tools at its disposal to build a Bitcoin reserve . The choice of method will likely depend on a complex interplay of political, economic, and strategic considerations. The Global FOMO Factor: Will a US Bitcoin Reserve Trigger a Stampede? Standard Chartered’s report emphasizes a crucial point: the “FOMO” – Fear of Missing Out – that a U.S. Bitcoin reserve could ignite on a global scale. Imagine the domino effect: Nation-State Adoption: If the U.S., the world’s largest economy, embraces Bitcoin as a reserve asset, other nations may feel compelled to follow suit. Institutional Investor Frenzy: Large institutional investors, already cautiously entering the crypto space, could accelerate their adoption, fearing they’ll be left behind. Retail Investor Surge: The narrative of Bitcoin as a legitimate reserve asset, endorsed by a major government, could draw in a new wave of retail investors. This crypto FOMO could lead to a significant appreciation in Bitcoin’s value and a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a mainstream asset class. It’s a powerful psychological factor that Standard Chartered believes is a likely consequence of U.S. government action. Navigating the Nuances of a US Bitcoin Reserve: Benefits and Challenges Establishing a U.S. Bitcoin reserve is not without its complexities. Let’s consider some potential benefits and challenges: Potential Benefits: Strategic Diversification: Bitcoin offers diversification away from traditional assets, potentially hedging against economic uncertainties and inflation. Technological Leadership: Embracing Bitcoin could position the U.S. as a leader in the burgeoning digital asset space, fostering innovation and economic growth. Future-Proofing Finances: As the world becomes increasingly digital, holding a significant Bitcoin reserve could be seen as a forward-thinking financial strategy. Potential Challenges: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility remains a concern for risk-averse institutions and governments. Regulatory Hurdles: Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape of cryptocurrencies will be crucial. Public Perception: Convincing the public and traditional financial institutions of Bitcoin’s legitimacy as a reserve asset may require significant effort. Conclusion: A Bold New Chapter for Bitcoin and the US? Standard Chartered’s report paints a compelling picture of a potential paradigm shift: the U.S. government actively pursuing a Bitcoin reserve , possibly funded by selling gold. While still speculative, this analysis highlights the growing recognition of Bitcoin’s strategic importance in the global financial landscape. Whether through a gold sell-off , tapping into the ESF, or revisiting the ‘Bitcoin Act’, the path to a U.S. Bitcoin reserve is being explored. If realized, it could trigger a wave of global adoption and solidify Bitcoin’s place as a major asset for the 21st century. The coming months and years will be crucial in watching how this intriguing narrative unfolds.

During its current phase two of token presale MUTM tokens exist at $0.015 and have gathered more than $2.3 million while attracting 4,300 token holders. The project demonstrates dual market advantages through its unique distribute-and-buy mechanism and practical financial usage which creates powerful potential in crypto markets. Experts foresee Mutuum Finance (MUTM) exceeding its future listing price of $0.06 to reach $10 by 2026 thereby generating an exceptional profit for early token purchasers. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Momentum The presale process of MUTM has achieved impressive results. The first phase quickly reached maximum supply and right now the second phase continues its issuance at a price of $0.015. The investment in MUTM at this point results in increased value up to 300% since the token’s scheduled $0.06 listing price. Early participants in Mutuum Finance obtain maximum financial benefits through the controlled pricing system which stimulates all buyers to act swiftly. People who join in this phase will automatically get a 33% value increase since the upcoming price hike to $0.02. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) achieves unique value due to its functional applications within real-life environments. King DeFi distributes passive earning opportunities and borrowing and lending services through its decentralized platform. Users can participate in mtToken programs to accumulate interest by converting their deposits into these tokens. Distributions of ETH result in generated mtETH tokens from depositor activities along with DAI deposits producing mtDAI tokens. Token transfers are enabled across DeFi platforms where mtTokens become available for additional usage within the network. The platform maintains platform stability through its overcollateralized lending system which also minimizes risks. Users need to present assets exceeding their loan request worth as collateral to protect lenders thus reducing the chance of borrowers defaulting. Mutuum Finance puts a P2P (peer-to-peer) lending feature as part of its system which allows users to carry out loan negotiations directly with others. Users benefit from this feature because it allows them to acquire meme coins that traditional lending pools usually ignore. The long-term development of Mutuum Finance relies heavily on its strategy to acquire and redistribute tokens. The platform directs part of its revenue stream toward purchasing MUTM tokens from market supply which are afterward distributed to mtToken stakers. Buy pressure stays consistent which increases long-term holding behavior by decreasing sell-off activities. The plan creates aligned interests between platform users and MUTM holders that maintain continuous platform adoption while causing MUTM token value to rise progressively in the medium to long-term period. Projected Returns and Market Potential Mutuum Finance established its tokenomics system specifically to bring substantial financial returns to investors who join during the initial phase. The current presale price of $0.015 allows investors to achieve a 300% gain when MUTM launches at $0.06. Beyond its current potential exists even more untapped potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to achieve a $5 value by 2026 which would generate a massive 33,233% profit for those joining the presale. Analysts predict MUTM will reach $5 by 2026 because of how the platform takes off combined with its innovative features and expanding DeFi solution market demand. The $100,000 contest operating as part of the project represents a significant factor drawing participants. Early contributors receive double motivation from the presence of ten $10,000 prizes which will be awarded to lucky participants. The $100,000 giveaway acts as a double benefit which simultaneously raises participant involvement and motivates more investors to buy MUTM tokens during the presale period. A Bright Future for Mutuum Finance The MUTM token represents a complete decentralized finance ecosystem which offers applications in the real world. At present the cryptocurrency MUTM stands at the top of market expectations because its presale has met success while integrating innovative features and attracting robust investor interest. Experts forecast MUTM tokens will reach $10 value by 2026 which opens extraordinary investment opportunities for current participants. The second stage of presale tokens are evaporating rapidly before the upcoming price uptick takes effect. This groundbreaking project offers you an opportunity that should not be ignored. Secure MUTM tokens now to benefit from remarkable market growth that will unfold throughout the upcoming years.

According to Chervinsky, having a strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve and digital asset stockpile could be great for the U.S. However, he believes this alone will not make the country the crypto capital of the world. There’s much more that needs to be done and got right for President Donald Trump’s quest to make the U.S. a global crypto capital to happen. The pro-crypto lawyer shared his comments on X, with this coming ahead of the White House’s Crypto Summit. Notably, he shared these sentiments following President Donald Trump’s executive order on a strategic Bitcoin reserve. None of these are by themselves enough. “For that, we need new policies empowering entrepreneurs to launch protocols and products made in the USA,” he posited. “Being “the crypto capital” doesn’t mean holding the most crypto wealth compared to other countries. It means having the most innovation, the most jobs, the most influence, the most economic activity. To achieve that goal, the government must support businesses, not just assets.” Read more: Bitcoin Strategic Reserve: Analyst outlines strategies for the U.S. to buy more Bitcoin Last week, Trump announced several altcoins would be part of a U.S. stockpile, including XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ) and Cardano ( ADA ). Following Trump’s EO on a BTC reserve and stockpile, the White House released a fact sheet that pinpointed what the order outlined. Part of this is the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve that will hold BTC seized or forfeited as a result of criminal or civil proceedings. The government will not sell the bitcoin and Treasury and Commerce departments are allowed to leverage “budget-neutral” strategies when looking to acquire more BTC. The EO also established a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile that will include holdings of forfeited digital assets. U.S. will not make any purchases of these altcoin assets, but hodl just the forfeited haul.

Taking on the issue of crypto debanking, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission dropping lawsuits and probes and more regulatory moves are good efforts. “But that’s not enough: the USA needs clear and durable rules of the road if we want to win. Clear, meaning entrepreneurs can build with total certainty that they’re on the right side of the law. Durable, meaning new leadership can’t easily rewrite those rules in the future,” he added. In his opinion, five areas need prioritizing amid efforts to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. These are: stablecoin legislation, market structure legislation, securities safe harbor for token issuance, protections for banking access and for developers of non-custodial software.

Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, ruling from Washington, D.C., on Friday, rejected a lawsuit filed by retirees and labor unions who argued that giving D.O.G.E access could expose millions of Americans’ private financial information. In her decision, she acknowledged the concerns but said there was no proof that the Treasury Department’s system had been compromised or that there was an imminent risk of data exposure. “If Plaintiffs could show that Defendants imminently planned to make their private information public or to share that information with individuals outside the federal government with no obligation to maintain its confidentiality, the Court would not hesitate to find a likelihood of irreparable harm,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote. But since no such evidence was presented, she ruled in favor of D.O.G.E. A federal judge in New York already blocked access last month Despite the ruling in Washington, D.O.G.E is still blocked from using the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS) because of a separate decision issued last month by Judge Jeannette Vargas in New York City. Vargas ruled that the process of granting D.O.G.E access was “rushed and ad hoc,” creating a “realistic danger that confidential financial information will be disclosed.” She ordered the Treasury Department to submit a detailed report by March 24, proving that employees at D.O.G.E had undergone proper vetting and training before being allowed near federal financial systems. The report must also lay out “mitigation procedures” to prevent security risks. Until those requirements are met, D.O.G.E remains locked out of the Treasury’s payment system. President Donald Trump created D.O.G.E through an executive order signed on January 20 right after inauguration, giving Elon broad authority to recommend spending cuts and eliminate waste in the federal government. The White House has described D.O.G.E as a cost-saving initiative, but critics say it’s an overreach of presidential power. Elon Musk takes questions from reporters as President Trump looks on in the Oval Office of the White House. Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images Trump has repeatedly called Elon Musk the leader of D.O.G.E, though administration lawyers have claimed in court that the billionaire’s role is “advisory” in an attempt to shield him from legal challenges. The agency’s aggressive budget-cutting efforts have already led to lawsuits, protests, and growing opposition from Republicans in Congress. On Thursday, Trump met with Elon and his Cabinet secretaries to discuss the restructuring of the federal workforce. He told agency leaders that they—not D.O.G.E—would have the final say over hiring and firing decisions. “Keep all the people you want, all the people that you need,” Trump said in the Oval Office meeting. But he also made it clear that if they didn’t cut enough, Elon would do it for them. “If they can cut, it’s better. If they don’t cut, then Elon will do the cutting.” The D.O.G.E-driven staff reductions have fired thousands of government employees and shut down entire offices. The rapid pace of the cuts has alarmed Republican lawmakers, who fear that the backlash from federal workers and their families could cost them votes in upcoming elections. Elon meets with Senate and House Republicans over voter backlash fears On Wednesday, Elon met with Senate Republicans behind closed doors to address concerns about D.O.G.E’s sweeping budget cuts and their impact on upcoming elections. According to a report from NBC News, Florida’s Senator Rick Scott was the one who arranged the meeting after many Republican lawmakers shared their frustration over the fact that D.O.G.E’s work was being carried out without transparency or input from Congress. The GOP senators also warned that voter backlash was becoming a serious problem. Some of the lawmakers have already faced hostile town hall meetings in their districts, where constituents demanded answers about the impact of D.O.G.E’s actions on government programs and jobs. Later that same Wednesday, Elon also met with House Republicans, telling reporters afterward that they discussed “the opportunity to improve expenditures in the government.” Meanwhile, President Trump said on Truth Social that: “DOGE has been an incredible success, and now that we have my Cabinet in place, I have instructed the Secretaries and Leadership to work with DOGE on Cost Cutting measures and Staffing. As the Secretaries learn about, and understand, the people working for the various Departments, they can be very precise as to who will remain, and who will go. We say the ‘scalpel’ rather than the ‘hatchet.’ The combination of them, Elon, DOGE, and other great people will be able to do things at a historic level.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

According to crypto pseudonymous scam hunter ZachXBT, the crypto behemoth saved his private keys with LastPass’s password manager. Ripple Founder, His Crypto Holding, and the Scam For more context, LastPass is the password manager hacked about three years ago. This infringement gave the attackers access to vast amounts of data, customer keys, API tokens, and MFA seeds. Unfortunately, this incident may have predisposed Larsen to risks that led to the loss of his XRP assets. The theft has not had a notable impact on the Ripple executive’s crypto holdings. ZachXBT recently identified seven active XRP Ledger addresses linked to Larsen. In the first month of this year alone, he allegedly transferred more than $109 million worth of XRP to crypto exchanges. Market observers have reason to believe that the transferred assets are likely for sale. ZachXBT Tracks LastPass-Related Security Breaches In 2024, ZachXBT alleged that blockchain payment firm Ripple was attacked, and the hackers stole 213 million XRP, worth $112.5 million at the time. However, this turned out not to be the case. Shortly after the announcement, Larsen made a post informing the public that someone had gained “unauthorized access” to his personal XRP account and not Ripple’s. This was only one of the numerous thefts and security breaches related to LastPass. According to ZachXBT, by the end of 2024, the “LastPass threat actor” had successfully siphoned more than $5.36 million worth of crypto from over 40 wallet addresses. US Government to Refund $8.2M to Scam Victims In other news, the United States is working on refunding about $8.2 million in seized cryptocurrency to victims of an elaborate scam that began with a simple “wrong number” text. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has identified 33 victims who fell prey to deceptive messages from scammers. The bad actors attempt to build relationships with unsuspecting victims before convincing them to invest in fraudulent crypto schemes. According to the details of US Attorneys Carol Skutnik and James Morford’s complaint, “The fraudster gained the victim’s trust using various manipulative tactics. Once trust was established, they shared fabricated success stories about cryptocurrency investments.” With the growing sophistication of scammers’ tactics, crypto users may need to utilize more security options.

White House Summit Unlikely to Deliver CGT Exemptions,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/white-house-crypto-tax-summit/,"Cryptocurrency enthusiasts, investors, and businesses have been keenly awaiting signals from the White House Crypto Summit, hoping for favorable policies that could boost the burgeoning digital asset market. However, recent whispers from inside sources suggest a less optimistic outlook, particularly concerning crypto tax regulations. Are hopes for capital gains tax (CGT) exemptions about to be dashed? Let’s dive into the latest buzz and understand what this could mean for the future of crypto in the United States. White House Crypto Summit: Setting the Stage for Crypto Regulation The White House Crypto Summit has been anticipated as a pivotal event, potentially shaping the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. With industry leaders, policymakers, and innovators converging, the summit was seen as an opportunity to address critical issues, foster innovation, and provide clarity on the government’s stance on digital assets. One of the most pressing questions on everyone’s mind? Would the summit bring any relief on the often-debated topic of capital gains tax crypto ? Unveiling the News: No CGT Exemptions on the Horizon? According to a recent report from Walter Bloomberg’s X account, citing a Punchbowl reporter, the answer to the CGT exemption question appears to be a resounding ‘no’. The report suggests that U.S. President Donald Trump is unlikely to advocate for cryptocurrency capital gains tax exemptions at today’s summit. This news, while still unofficial, has sent ripples through the crypto community, dampening hopes for immediate tax relief. Why is Capital Gains Tax on Crypto a Hot Topic? To understand the significance of this news, it’s crucial to grasp why capital gains tax crypto is such a significant issue for crypto holders. Here’s a breakdown: Tax Implications on Profits: Capital gains tax is levied on the profits you make when you sell or exchange a capital asset, like cryptocurrency, for a profit. In the U.S., these gains are taxed at different rates depending on your income level and how long you held the asset (short-term vs. long-term). Complexity and Compliance: Calculating and reporting crypto taxes can be complex. Each crypto transaction, including trades, swaps, and even using crypto to buy goods and services, can be a taxable event. This complexity creates a compliance burden for individuals and businesses. Impact on Adoption and Innovation: Many in the crypto space argue that the current CGT regime stifles innovation and adoption. They believe that exemptions or more favorable tax policies could encourage greater participation in the crypto market and foster growth within the industry. Comparison with Traditional Assets: There’s an ongoing debate about how cryptocurrencies should be classified for tax purposes. Are they currencies, commodities, or something else entirely? This classification directly impacts how they are taxed and whether they should be treated differently from traditional assets. The Potential Implications of No CGT Exemptions If the White House Crypto Summit indeed does not announce any CGT exemptions, what could be the potential fallout? Let’s consider some key implications: Continued Tax Burden for Crypto Investors: Crypto holders will continue to be subject to capital gains tax on their profits, potentially impacting their investment returns. Discouragement for Short-Term Trading: High CGT rates, especially for short-term holdings, might discourage frequent trading, potentially affecting market liquidity. Compliance Challenges Persist: The complexity of crypto tax reporting will remain, requiring users to meticulously track transactions and potentially seek professional tax advice. Industry Disappointment: The crypto industry, which has been advocating for friendlier regulatory frameworks, may view this as a setback in their efforts to gain mainstream acceptance and favorable policies. Focus Shifts to Other Regulatory Aspects: Without CGT exemptions, the focus might shift to other areas of crypto regulation discussed at the summit, such as clarity on security classifications, stablecoin regulation, and consumer protection measures. What Could Have Been? The Case for CGT Exemptions Advocates for CGT exemptions argue that such measures could unlock significant benefits for the crypto ecosystem and the broader economy. Here are some potential advantages of exempting cryptocurrencies from capital gains tax, or at least offering more favorable treatment: Benefit Description Boosted Adoption Tax exemptions could make crypto more attractive to retail and institutional investors, leading to increased adoption and market growth. Stimulated Innovation Favorable tax policies can encourage innovation and investment in crypto-related businesses and technologies within the U.S. Enhanced Competitiveness Countries with more crypto-friendly tax regimes might attract talent and capital away from the U.S., impacting its competitiveness in the global digital economy. Simplified Tax Reporting Exemptions or simplified rules could reduce the complexity of crypto tax reporting, making it easier for individuals and businesses to comply. Economic Growth Increased crypto adoption and innovation can contribute to overall economic growth, creating jobs and generating new revenue streams. Trump Crypto Policy: A Glimpse into the Future? While the news regarding CGT exemptions might be discouraging, it’s important to consider the broader context of Trump crypto policy . The White House Crypto Summit itself signals a growing recognition of the importance of digital assets. Even without immediate tax breaks, the summit could pave the way for other positive developments, such as: Regulatory Clarity: The summit could lead to clearer regulatory guidelines for the crypto industry, reducing uncertainty and fostering a more stable environment for businesses to operate. Innovation-Friendly Frameworks: Discussions at the summit might focus on creating frameworks that encourage innovation in the crypto space while addressing legitimate concerns like consumer protection and financial stability. Dialogue and Collaboration: The summit provides a platform for dialogue between industry stakeholders and policymakers, fostering collaboration and mutual understanding. Long-Term Policy Vision: Even if immediate CGT exemptions are not announced, the summit could lay the groundwork for a long-term vision for crypto regulation in the U.S., potentially including future tax reforms. Actionable Insights for Crypto Holders In light of the likely continuation of crypto tax obligations, what actionable steps can crypto holders take? Maintain Detailed Records: Keep meticulous records of all crypto transactions, including dates, amounts, prices, and wallet addresses. This is crucial for accurate tax reporting. Utilize Crypto Tax Software: Consider using crypto tax software to help track transactions, calculate capital gains and losses, and generate tax reports. Seek Professional Tax Advice: Consult with a qualified tax professional who understands crypto taxation. They can provide personalized guidance and ensure compliance with current regulations. Stay Informed About Regulatory Changes: Keep abreast of any changes in crypto tax laws and regulations. The regulatory landscape is constantly evolving, and staying informed is essential. Advocate for Favorable Policies: Engage with industry advocacy groups and policymakers to voice your support for more crypto-friendly tax policies and regulations. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Tax Landscape While the news from the White House Crypto Summit regarding CGT exemptions may be disappointing for some, it underscores the importance of understanding and navigating the existing crypto tax landscape. The summit itself is a significant step towards acknowledging the crypto industry’s growing importance, and ongoing dialogues are crucial for shaping future policies. For now, crypto holders must remain vigilant about their tax obligations, maintain meticulous records, and stay informed about regulatory developments. The journey of crypto regulation is far from over, and continued engagement and advocacy will be vital in shaping a future where innovation and responsible regulation can coexist.

In a post on the social media platform X, Yakovenko cites why he does not support Donald Trump’s decision to create a national reserve of digital assets, a move that the President says will ensure the US becomes the “crypto capital of the world.” “My reserve order of preference: No reserve, because if you want decentralization to fail you’d put the government in charge of it. Or states run their own reserve as a hedge against the Fed making a mistake. Or if there has to be a reserve, it’s based on objectively measurable requirements. I don’t care what they are, they can even be constructed such that only Bitcoin satisfies them right now, they just must be objectively measurable and rationally justified. If there is a target to beat, the Solana ecosystem will get it done.” Yakovenko shares his concern following Trump’s statement that in addition to Bitcoin ( BTC ), the reserve will include Solana, Ethereum ( ETH ), XRP and Cardano ( ADA ). Yakovenko says he did not ask SOL to be part of the reserve amid reports that the blockchain payments firm Ripple pitched Solana’s inclusion to bolster the legitimacy of XRP as a reserve asset. “No one asked me, and I didn’t pitch it.” According to White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and create a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile consisting of crypto assets, excluding Bitcoin, that were forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings.

41294754,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=138137,1741376756,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unveiling Shocking AI Chatbot Bias: Russian Propaganda’s Sinister Influence,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-chatbot-russian-propaganda-influence/,"Is your AI chatbot feeding you a diet of disinformation? A new report is raising serious alarms about the subtle yet significant influence of Russian propaganda on the responses of popular AI Chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta AI. For cryptocurrency and tech enthusiasts who rely on accurate information, this revelation is critical. Imagine making investment decisions based on AI-generated insights, only to realize those insights are skewed by state-sponsored misinformation. Let’s dive into this concerning development and understand its implications. How Russian Propaganda Infiltrates AI Chatbots NewsGuard, a company specializing in rating news and information reliability, has dropped a bombshell report. They claim to have uncovered a network originating from Moscow, ominously named “Pravda,” actively working to manipulate AI Chatbots . This isn’t just about biased opinions; it’s about the deliberate injection of false narratives into the very systems we are increasingly relying on for information. Here’s the core of the problem: Pravda’s Massive Misinformation Campaign: This network reportedly pumped out a staggering 3.6 million misleading articles in 2024 alone. Their strategy? Flood the internet with pro-Russian falsehoods. SEO as a Weapon: Pravda isn’t just publishing content; they are masters of Search Engine Optimization (SEO). By strategically optimizing their articles, they ensure their false narratives rank high in search results. Web Crawlers and AI Vulnerability: AI Chatbots heavily rely on web crawlers to gather information and generate responses. When these crawlers ingest propaganda-laden content, the chatbots, in turn, can inadvertently regurgitate misinformation. NewsGuard’s investigation involved probing 10 leading chatbots. The disturbing finding? A significant 33% of the time, these chatbots repeated false Russian propaganda narratives. One prime example cited was the debunked conspiracy theory about the U.S. operating secret bioweapons labs in Ukraine. The Challenge of AI Disinformation: Why is this Happening? The effectiveness of this propaganda infiltration boils down to the very architecture of current AI Chatbots . These models are designed to learn from and process vast amounts of online text data. When a network like Pravda strategically floods the internet with misinformation and optimizes it for search engines, they are essentially poisoning the well of information that these AI models drink from. Think of it like this: Factor Explanation Data Dependence AI Chatbots learn from massive datasets of text and code, primarily scraped from the internet. SEO Manipulation Propaganda networks use SEO techniques to boost the visibility of their content in search results. Crawler Vulnerability Web crawlers, used by AI to gather information, are indiscriminate and can ingest propaganda alongside legitimate content. Output Contamination As a result, AI Chatbots can inadvertently learn and repeat false narratives present in the data they are trained on. This presents a significant challenge, especially for chatbots heavily reliant on web engines for real-time information. The very mechanisms that make these AI models powerful also make them vulnerable to manipulation through sophisticated online misinformation campaigns. Is Chatbot Bias Inevitable? Addressing the Propaganda Problem The NewsGuard report paints a concerning picture, but is there a way to mitigate this chatbot bias and propaganda influence? The answer isn’t simple, but here are potential paths forward: Improved Data Filtering: AI developers need to enhance their data filtering mechanisms. This involves developing more sophisticated techniques to identify and weed out propaganda and disinformation from training datasets and real-time web crawls. Source Verification and Credibility Checks: Chatbots could be designed to incorporate source verification steps. This could involve cross-referencing information with trusted sources and flagging information originating from sources with a known history of spreading misinformation. Algorithmic Transparency and Explainability: Understanding how AI models arrive at their conclusions is crucial. Greater transparency in AI algorithms can help identify and address biases and vulnerabilities to propaganda. User Awareness and Critical Thinking: Ultimately, users need to be aware of the potential for AI disinformation . Critical thinking and healthy skepticism remain essential when interacting with AI chatbots, especially on sensitive topics. The Future of AI and Information Integrity: What’s at Stake? The revelation of Russian propaganda influencing AI Chatbots is a stark reminder of the ongoing battle for information integrity in the digital age. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into our lives, from financial decisions to news consumption, ensuring the reliability of AI-generated information is paramount. For the cryptocurrency world, where trust and accurate information are vital, this issue is particularly relevant. Imagine relying on an AI chatbot for market analysis or investment advice, only to be subtly steered by propaganda. The consequences could be significant. Moving forward, the tech industry, policymakers, and users must work together to address this challenge. Developing robust defenses against propaganda and promoting media literacy will be crucial to ensuring that AI remains a tool for knowledge and progress, rather than a vehicle for manipulation and online misinformation .

41295136,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=138141,1741377336,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Crypto Exchange Shutdown: Garantex Crumbles Under Global Crackdown,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/garantex-exchange-shutdown-money-laundering/,"In a stunning move that reverberated across the cryptocurrency world, the U.S. Department of Justice, in a coordinated effort with Germany and Finland, has effectively dismantled the infrastructure of crypto exchange Garantex. This decisive action, announced on the DOJ’s official website, comes amidst serious allegations of facilitating money laundering and blatant sanctions violations. Imagine a financial institution processing billions in transactions while allegedly turning a blind eye to illicit activities – this is the picture painted by the authorities regarding Garantex. Since April 2019, this exchange reportedly processed a staggering $96 billion in crypto transactions, raising serious red flags and ultimately leading to this dramatic crypto exchange shutdown . Crypto Exchange Shutdown: Unpacking the Global Action Against Garantex The recent takedown of Garantex isn’t just another regulatory action; it’s a powerful signal highlighting the increasing global scrutiny on cryptocurrency exchanges. The coordinated effort between the U.S., Germany, and Finland underscores the international commitment to clamping down on illicit activities within the digital asset space. But what exactly happened? Let’s break down the key elements of this crypto exchange shutdown : Joint Operation: This wasn’t a unilateral action. The involvement of three major nations demonstrates a unified front against crypto-related financial crime. Infrastructure Takedown: Authorities didn’t just issue fines or warnings; they targeted the very infrastructure that allowed Garantex to operate, effectively shutting down its services. Serious Allegations: The core accusations revolve around money laundering and sanctions violations, suggesting a deliberate disregard for international financial regulations. Massive Transaction Volume: The $96 billion in processed transactions since 2019 highlights the scale of Garantex’s operations and the potential for illicit funds to have flowed through the platform. Individual Accountability: Beyond the exchange itself, two managers are reportedly facing accusations, indicating a move to hold individuals responsible for alleged misconduct. Garantex Exchange Crackdown: Delving into Money Laundering and Sanctions Violations The allegations against Garantex are severe, focusing on two critical areas: money laundering and sanctions violations. A Garantex exchange crackdown became inevitable as authorities investigated the extent of these alleged illegal operations. Let’s examine what these accusations entail: Money Laundering: Facilitating Illicit Funds: Money laundering involves disguising the origins of illegally obtained funds to make them appear legitimate. Exchanges can be exploited to convert illicit crypto into usable currency, or vice versa. Lack of KYC/AML: Robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures are crucial for exchanges. Allegations suggest Garantex may have had inadequate or deliberately lax controls, allowing suspicious transactions to slip through. Billions Laundered: The sheer volume of transactions processed by Garantex, coupled with the allegations, points to a potentially massive money laundering operation, estimated to be multi-billion dollar. Sanctions Violations: Circumventing Restrictions: International sanctions are imposed on certain individuals, entities, and countries to restrict their access to the global financial system. Crypto exchanges can be used to bypass these restrictions. Aiding Sanctioned Entities: If Garantex knowingly or unknowingly facilitated transactions for sanctioned entities, it would constitute a serious violation of international law. Global Security Implications: Sanctions are a key tool in international diplomacy and security. Violations undermine these efforts and can have far-reaching consequences. Money Laundering Crackdown: Why This Action Matters for the Crypto World This money laundering crackdown on Garantex is not an isolated incident; it’s part of a broader global effort to regulate the cryptocurrency space and combat financial crime. The implications extend far beyond just one exchange. Why is this action so significant? Legitimacy of Crypto: Incidents of money laundering can tarnish the reputation of the entire crypto industry. Decisive action like the Garantex shutdown is crucial for demonstrating that crypto can and will be regulated, fostering greater trust and legitimacy. Investor Protection: Robust regulations and enforcement are essential to protect investors from scams, fraud, and illicit activities. A cleaner crypto environment attracts more responsible investment and innovation. Regulatory Clarity: These actions send a clear message to crypto exchanges worldwide: compliance with KYC/AML regulations and international laws is non-negotiable. This promotes greater clarity and a level playing field. Deterrent Effect: The severity of the Garantex takedown serves as a powerful deterrent to other exchanges that might be tempted to skirt regulations or facilitate illicit activities. It showcases the potential consequences of non-compliance. Crypto Sanctions Violations: Navigating the Complex Web of Global Regulations The allegations of crypto sanctions violations against Garantex highlight the complex web of global regulations that cryptocurrency exchanges must navigate. Sanctions compliance is becoming an increasingly critical aspect of operating in the crypto space. What are the key challenges and considerations? Challenge Description Actionable Insight Evolving Sanctions Lists Sanctions lists are constantly updated and can be complex to interpret. Implement real-time monitoring and automated screening systems to stay updated on changes. Decentralized Nature of Crypto Crypto’s borderless nature makes it challenging to enforce geographically-based sanctions. Adopt a risk-based approach, focusing on transaction monitoring and identifying suspicious patterns. Anonymity Concerns While not entirely anonymous, crypto transactions can be harder to trace than traditional financial flows. Utilize advanced analytics and blockchain forensics tools to enhance transaction transparency and identify potentially sanctioned individuals or entities. Global Regulatory Fragmentation Different jurisdictions have varying approaches to crypto regulation and sanctions enforcement. Develop a comprehensive compliance framework that aligns with international standards and best practices, adapting to local requirements where necessary. Digital Asset Regulation: Charting the Course for the Future of Crypto Exchanges The Garantex case underscores the growing momentum towards stricter digital asset regulation globally. Governments and regulatory bodies are no longer taking a hands-off approach. What does this mean for the future of crypto exchanges and the broader digital asset ecosystem? Increased Regulatory Oversight: Expect more stringent licensing requirements, compliance audits, and reporting obligations for crypto exchanges. Focus on Consumer Protection: Regulations will likely prioritize protecting users from fraud, market manipulation, and illicit activities. International Cooperation: Cross-border collaboration between regulatory agencies, as seen in the Garantex case, will become more common to address global crypto crime. Innovation and Compliance: The challenge for the industry is to innovate and grow while adhering to evolving regulatory frameworks. Exchanges that prioritize compliance will be best positioned for long-term success. Mainstream Adoption: Clear and effective regulation can ultimately pave the way for greater mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies by building trust and confidence in the market. The shutdown of Garantex is a watershed moment, sending a clear message that illicit activities within the crypto space will not be tolerated. It’s a call to action for exchanges to prioritize compliance, enhance security measures, and actively combat money laundering and sanctions violations. For the crypto industry, this event serves as a stark reminder that responsible growth and long-term sustainability depend on operating within a robust regulatory framework. The era of the Wild West in crypto is rapidly closing, ushering in an era of greater accountability and regulatory oversight. This crackdown, while potentially disruptive in the short term, is ultimately a necessary step towards building a more secure and trustworthy digital asset ecosystem.

This large movement, reported by Whale Alert, has raised questions about potential price fluctuations and market trends. Amid speculation surrounding the recent whale activity, analysts have highlighted bullish indicators in the recent XRP price action. According to analysis, the Ripple token has broken key resistance levels, suggesting that a new phase of price discovery may be underway. XRP News: Ripple Whales Transfer 150M Coins According to Whale Alert , a blockchain tracking service, 150 million XRP valued at approximately $380 million has been moved between unknown wallets. This transaction has sparked speculation regarding the intent behind the movement, as large transfers by Ripple whales can influence market sentiment. Such transactions are often associated with either institutional investors shifting assets or over-the-counter (OTC) trades. If the transfer is linked to an exchange deposit, traders may anticipate a sell-off, leading to short-term bearish pressure. Conversely, if the funds were moved to a private wallet, it could indicate accumulation, potentially supporting price stability. Notably, in the most recent XRP news, whales have been on a selling spree following President Trump’s statement that the US will not include Ripple in its digital asset reserve. Over 230 million XRP , worth approximately $575 million, has been sold by large holders in just 48 hours. XRP Price Action: Key Resistance Levels Broken Technical analyst Dark Defender has identified XRP price action as a potential turning point. His analysis points to a structured breakout, followed by a successful retest of critical support levels. The confluence of strong buying pressure and historical price trends suggests a bullish trajectory. Source: X His projections indicate that XRP price could be entering a new growth phase, with the potential for a parabolic rally. If the price sustains above key levels, further upside could be expected. However, external factors, including broader market conditions, remain important in determining the altcoin’s next move. Analyst Dark Defender added, “I’ve never seen $XRP Bullish more than this before” Technical Indicators Signal Strong Momentum According to XRP news, market indicators remain bullish, suggesting ongoing momentum in the top altcoin price action. Analysts have also pointed out that increased whale accumulation often coincides with strong price movement. More so, the MACD histogram shows a shift from red to green bars, indicating a potential reversal in momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence supports the bullish outlook, as the MACD line is attempting to cross above the signal line, which could signal further upward movement. Nonetheless, in other XRP news, analysts have identified a head-and-shoulders pattern, suggesting a potential bearish breakdown. According to Ripple price prediction , the neckline support at $1.96 is a critical level, and if breached, XRP could decline further toward the $1.13 zone. However, a move above $2.73 could shift momentum, potentially pushing the price toward last year’s high of $3.41.

The interview, hosted by Tucker Carlson and posted on social media on Bankman-Fried’s 33rd birthday, took even his own public relations representative, Mark Botnick, by surprise. As a result, Botnick has resigned from his position, stating he had no prior knowledge of the interview and was not involved in its planning. In a statement to Business Insider, Botnick said, “As of today, I no longer represent SBF.” It is important to note that Botnick is a seasoned public relations strategist who previously worked with former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He has managed Bankman-Fried’s image since the collapse of FTX in November 2022 and played a crucial role in navigating the embattled entrepreneur through various legal challenges, including his bail violations and pre-trial imprisonment. However, SBF’s increasing unpredictability appears to have strained their working relationship. Recently, he posted messages on X advising on former President Donald Trump’s plans to remove federal employees – actions Botnick claims were neither approved nor authorized by him. Jailhouse Confessions: SBF Says He’s Not a Criminal During the interview , Bankman-Fried reflected on his prison experience and commented on fellow inmate Sean “Diddy” Combs at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, saying, “He’s been kind to people in the unit. He’s been kind to me. It’s also, it’s a position no one wants to be in, you know – obviously he doesn’t, I don’t. As you said, it’s, it’s kind of a soul crushing place for the world in general.” Despite his conviction and ongoing appeals, Bankman-Fried maintained his innocence, telling Carlson, “I don’t think I was a criminal.” He also estimated that, at the very least, he would be in his late 40s when released, despite being sentenced until age 57. His prior interviews with major outlets such as The Financial Times, Bloomberg News, and Vox have already been used against him in court and have served as evidence of how he allegedly misled investors. SBF’s Political Shape-Shifting SBF’s political allegiances appear to be as fluid as his business ethics, as seen in his interview with a right-wing political commentator. After previously positioning himself as a major donor to the Democratic Party, he now seems to be pivoting toward President Trump and the Republican Party. He criticized Joe Biden as well as former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, whose aggressive stance on cryptocurrency regulation did little to help the FTX founder’s cause. Now serving a 25-year prison sentence, Bankman-Fried appears to be eyeing a different path to redemption – through the possibility of a Trump pardon. Speculation about a potential pardon first gained traction in December which was primarily fueled by discussions of Bankman-Fried’s deep Democratic ties. Even Elon Musk weighed in, saying he would be “shocked” if a pardon weren’t on the table. However, as his legal avenues have dwindled, reports have surfaced that his parents have been lobbying for clemency from Trump, suggesting that SBF’s political calculus has shifted dramatically.

According to data shared by market analyst James Van Straten, the weekly decline of DXY has exceeded -4 deviations. The analyst stated that this situation is a rare event that has only occurred three times in Bitcoin history and that this sharp decline in DXY could be a bottom sign for Bitcoin. According to the analyst, the weekly decline in DXY exceeding -4 deviations was seen in history in November 2022, when Bitcoin reached a bottom of $ 15,500 during the FTX crash; in March 2020, when Bitcoin fell below $ 5,000, and in the 2015 bear market. According to the analyst, historical data shows that every time the DXY experienced a decline greater than -4 standard deviations, it coincided with a Bitcoin bottom, which was followed by significant price increases. Apart from Straten, Real Vision analyst Jamie Coutts also noted that significant declines in DXY are strongly correlated with bullish trends in Bitcoin. Noting that the sharp decline in DXY has historically been associated with Bitcoin bottoms, the analyst said that since 2013 there have been eight instances where DXY fell by more than 2.5% in three days, and in each case BTC prices rose over the next 90 days. Stating that Bitcoin provided an average return of 37% with a 100% success rate during this period, Coutts explained that this rate corresponds to a BTC price of approximately $ 123,000. The analyst also stated that DXY experienced its 4th biggest 3-day decline since 2013, that this is the bottom for Bitcoin and that he expects a new ATH by May: “The stage is set for Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high by May.” https://twitter.com/Jamie1Coutts/status/1897783064841097578 *This is not investment advice.

The Trump Organization has sued Capital One Bank for allegedly closing over 300 bank accounts in 2021 “without cause” as tech bigwigs and crypto leaders lamented the debanking crisis during previous administrations. Today, the Trump Organization filed a lawsuit in Miami-Dade County against @CapitalOne to hold the bank accountable for their egregious conduct in unjustifiably terminating over 300 of the company’s bank accounts without cause, in 2021. The decision by Capital One to “debank”… — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) March 7, 2025 Long’s Custodia Bank and other top crypto voices, like Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter, have often pointed to Operation Choke Point 2.0, a coordinated clandestine effort by regulators like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to block digital asset companies from banking services. Silicon Valley businesses decried similar circumstances, attributing the pattern to political targeting and a war against certain tech-heavy firms. “The actions taken by Capital One and other major financial institutions represent a dangerous precedent that could threaten the operations of countless businesses across the nation, particularly those with a strong and independent voice.” Eric Trump on Capital One lawsuit The Trump Org lawsuit comes when tech entrepreneurs and crypto top shots have sought answers about debanking. Lawmakers have held at least one hearing on the matter, and Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell pledged to aid the anti-debanking effort. You might also like: Fed chair Powell agrees to help end crypto debanking Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis from Wyoming threatened federal prosecution against FDIC staffers, reportedly destroying evidence related to OCP 2.0 and debanking. While the Capital One lawsuit doesn’t seem directly crypto-linked, Long believes the move may shed light on a broader malpractice from U.S. banking watchdogs. Till now, crypto debanking enquiries have focused on institutions regulated by the FDIC and the Fed. The Trump Org lawsuit could widen the scope to include potential bad faith oversight from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Long argued on X in response to the Capital One complaint. The bank sued by the Trumps is an OCC-regulated bank w/ a Fed-regulated holding co. So far most #debanking info that has come out publicly is from the FDIC & Fed (thru FOIA & lawsuits), but if this new lawsuit reaches discovery then OCC debanking info could come out too. 🍿 — Caitlin Long 🔑⚡️🟠 (@CaitlinLong_) March 7, 2025 Read more: FDIC releases documents related to crypto debanking",News|Crypto banking|Donald Trump|FDIC,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-03-07 20:00:00

After retracing from $130 to the $100 mark, LTC has successfully held this crucial support, signaling that bulls are still active in defending key levels. Related Reading: BTC Could Gain Momentum For A Move To $150,000 If Bulls Reclaim This Level – Details While most altcoins have struggled, Litecoin appears to maintain a slight bullish edge. According to Santiment data, LTC continues to show strength in its on-chain metrics, with the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio signaling a bullish outlook. This suggests that investors are still holding onto their LTC, with less incentive to sell at current levels, potentially paving the way for a recovery in the near future. However, the coming days will be critical for Litecoin, as Bitcoin remains under pressure, struggling below key levels. Market uncertainty continues to drive volatility, and if BTC experiences further downside, LTC could face increased selling pressure. On the other hand, if Bitcoin stabilizes or pushes higher, Litecoin could quickly capitalize on its strong fundamentals and begin a renewed upward trend. Litecoin Bulls Defend Crucial Demand Litecoin is currently trading between key liquidity levels, navigating months of volatility and uncertainty in the broader market. Despite the recent market downturn, LTC has shown relative strength over the past few weeks, managing to hold crucial support levels while other altcoins continue to struggle. Related Reading: Dogecoin Indicator Flashes A Buy Signal On The 4-Day Chart – Is DOGE Gearing Up For A Rebound? However, price action remains uncertain, as Litecoin has been unable to break above key supply zones. Bulls have attempted to push the price higher, but selling pressure at resistance levels has kept LTC within a tight trading range. Until a clear breakout occurs, traders remain cautious about the next major move. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared insights on X, highlighting that Litecoin maintains a bullish outlook based on on-chain data. According to Santiment’s MVRV Ratio, LTC is showing strength, suggesting that investors are holding onto their positions despite the market’s recent volatility. This metric often indicates whether an asset is undervalued or overvalued, and in Litecoin’s case, it signals that the coin still has strong upside potential. If the broader crypto market starts to recover, Litecoin could emerge as one of the strongest assets, given its relative stability and bullish on-chain signals. For now, all eyes remain on LTC’s ability to hold key support levels and whether bulls can break past resistance to confirm a new uptrend. LTC Price Action: Technical Levels To Watch Litecoin is currently trading at $104 after facing days of selling pressure. However, despite the bearish sentiment, sellers have struggled to push LTC below the crucial $100 demand zone. This level has acted as strong support, preventing further downside, and every day that LTC holds above this mark increases the probability of a recovery move. For bulls to regain control, Litecoin needs to reclaim the $115 level soon. A decisive break above this resistance could trigger renewed buying momentum, paving the way for a push into higher price levels around $130-$145. These areas represent the next major liquidity zones, where LTC could face strong resistance but also attract significant bullish interest.

If Litecoin continues to hold above $100, it would indicate buying confidence at lower levels, setting the stage for a potential breakout. However, failure to reclaim $115 in the short term could keep LTC in a prolonged consolidation phase, leaving its next major move uncertain.

The landscape of digital asset management just got a whole lot more interesting, and potentially profitable. Leading Bitcoin staking platform Core has forged a powerful alliance with Singapore-based digital asset custodian Cobo. This strategic partnership is poised to revolutionize how institutional players in APAC engage with Bitcoin staking, offering a compelling avenue to earn yield while maintaining robust asset security. Let’s delve into the details of this exciting collaboration and what it means for the future of institutional crypto investment in the region. Unveiling the Core-Cobo Partnership: A New Era for Bitcoin Staking in APAC This isn’t just another partnership announcement in the ever-busy crypto space. This collaboration between Core and Cobo is a calculated move to address the growing demand for secure and accessible Bitcoin staking solutions, specifically tailored for the unique needs of institutional investors in the Asia-Pacific market. Here’s a breakdown of what makes this partnership noteworthy: Strategic Focus on APAC: The Asia-Pacific region is a hotbed for crypto adoption and innovation. This partnership strategically targets this burgeoning market, recognizing the immense potential for institutional growth within APAC’s digital asset ecosystem. Institutional Grade Security with Cobo: Cobo, a renowned Singapore-based custodian, brings to the table its institutional-grade security infrastructure. This is paramount for institutions that require the highest levels of security and compliance when engaging with digital assets. Yield Generation with Core’s Platform: Core provides the sophisticated Bitcoin staking protocol that has already garnered significant traction, securing over 6,200 BTC (valued at $548 million). Their platform is designed to efficiently generate yield on staked Bitcoin. Asset Control Remains Key: A crucial aspect for institutional clients is maintaining control over their assets. This partnership emphasizes enabling institutions to earn yield without having to relinquish custody of their Bitcoin. Expanding Institutional Access: Core’s collaboration with Cobo is a continuation of their strategy to broaden institutional access to Bitcoin staking . Previous partnerships with industry heavyweights like Maple Finance, BitGo, Copper, and Hex Trust underscore their commitment to this mission. Why is Bitcoin Staking Gaining Momentum? Bitcoin staking , while conceptually different from staking in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains, is becoming an increasingly attractive option for BTC holders. It allows them to earn passive income on their Bitcoin holdings without selling or actively trading. Here’s why it’s gaining traction: Passive Income Stream: In a volatile market, staking offers a predictable way to generate yield on otherwise idle assets. This can be particularly appealing to institutions with long-term Bitcoin holdings. Optimizing Bitcoin Holdings: Rather than just holding Bitcoin as a store of value, staking allows institutions to put their assets to work and generate returns, enhancing overall portfolio performance. Growing Institutional Acceptance: As the crypto market matures, institutions are becoming more comfortable exploring yield-generating strategies within the digital asset space. Bitcoin staking represents a relatively lower-risk entry point compared to more complex DeFi strategies. Demand for Diversification: Institutions are constantly seeking diversification in their investment portfolios. Crypto yield products, like Bitcoin staking , offer a new asset class for diversification and potential alpha generation. APAC Crypto Market: A Fertile Ground for Bitcoin Staking The Asia-Pacific region presents a unique and compelling landscape for crypto yield opportunities, especially for Bitcoin staking . Several factors contribute to APAC’s significance in this context: High Crypto Adoption Rates: Many APAC countries exhibit some of the highest crypto adoption rates globally. This indicates a strong existing user base and a generally favorable regulatory environment (in certain jurisdictions) towards digital assets. Tech-Savvy Investor Base: APAC is home to a large and growing population of tech-savvy investors who are keen to explore new investment avenues, including cryptocurrencies and yield-generating strategies. Institutional Interest Surge: Institutional interest in crypto is rapidly rising across APAC. Financial institutions, family offices, and corporations in the region are increasingly looking to incorporate digital assets into their portfolios. Diverse Regulatory Landscape: While the regulatory landscape across APAC is diverse, there is a general trend towards developing frameworks for digital assets, providing more clarity and fostering institutional participation. Institutional Crypto: Addressing the Needs of Large Players When it comes to institutional crypto investment, the requirements are vastly different from retail investors. Institutions prioritize factors such as security, compliance, custody solutions, and robust risk management frameworks. The Core-Cobo partnership is specifically designed to address these institutional needs: Feature Benefit for Institutions Secure Custody by Cobo Provides peace of mind with institutional-grade security and compliance, mitigating counterparty risk. Asset Control Institutions retain control over their Bitcoin, a critical factor for risk management and fiduciary responsibilities. Yield Generation via Core Access to Core’s proven Bitcoin staking platform, enabling them to earn competitive yield on their BTC holdings. Dedicated Institutional Support Tailored support and services to meet the specific needs of institutional clients, ensuring a smooth and efficient staking experience. Regulatory Compliance Focus Both Core and Cobo operate with a strong emphasis on regulatory compliance, aligning with institutional requirements for regulated financial activities. Navigating the Landscape of Bitcoin Staking: Key Considerations While Bitcoin staking offers compelling benefits, institutions need to be aware of certain considerations: Understanding the Risks: Like any investment strategy, Bitcoin staking carries risks. Institutions must conduct thorough due diligence and understand the specific risks associated with the chosen platform and protocol. Choosing the Right Partner: Selecting a reputable and secure platform like Core, and a trusted custodian like Cobo, is crucial to mitigate risks and ensure the safety of assets. Regulatory Clarity: Institutions should stay informed about the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding crypto yield and Bitcoin staking in their specific jurisdictions. Operational Efficiency: Integrating Bitcoin staking into existing operational workflows requires careful planning and execution to ensure efficiency and minimize disruptions. Actionable Insights for Institutions For institutions in APAC considering Bitcoin staking , here are some actionable steps: Conduct Thorough Research: Deeply understand the mechanics of Bitcoin staking , the platforms available, and the associated risks and rewards. Evaluate Custodial Solutions: Prioritize secure and reputable custodians like Cobo that offer institutional-grade security and compliance. Assess Platform Track Record: Examine the track record and reputation of Bitcoin staking platforms like Core, considering their partnerships, security measures, and yield performance. Start with a Pilot Program: Consider initiating a pilot program with a smaller allocation to test the waters and gain practical experience with Bitcoin staking before larger deployments. Seek Expert Consultation: Engage with crypto asset specialists and advisors to navigate the complexities of Bitcoin staking and ensure alignment with your institution’s investment objectives and risk tolerance. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Institutional Bitcoin Yield The partnership between Core and Cobo marks a significant step forward in making Bitcoin staking more accessible, secure, and institutionally viable within the dynamic APAC region. By combining Core’s innovative staking platform with Cobo’s robust custodial infrastructure, this collaboration offers a compelling solution for institutions seeking to unlock the yield potential of their Bitcoin holdings while maintaining paramount asset control. As institutional interest in crypto yield continues to surge, expect to see more such strategic alliances shaping the future of digital asset management and investment.

This news, initially reported by Watcher Guru on X and citing CNBC, has sent ripples of excitement and speculation throughout the crypto community. Could this be the catalyst for the next major bull run? Let’s dive deep into what this could mean for the future of Bitcoin and the broader digital asset market. Why is Bitcoin Accumulation Gaining Momentum? Before we delve into the specifics of China and the Middle East, it’s crucial to understand the broader context. Bitcoin accumulation , the act of strategically increasing one’s Bitcoin holdings, is not a new phenomenon. However, recent geopolitical and economic factors are making it increasingly attractive, especially for nations seeking diversification and financial innovation. Here’s why: Decentralization and Independence: Bitcoin operates outside traditional financial systems, offering a hedge against centralized control and potential sanctions. For nations seeking economic independence, this is a powerful allure. Inflation Hedge: With inflation rates soaring globally, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a store of value, similar to gold, but with potentially higher growth prospects. Its limited supply of 21 million coins makes it inherently deflationary in the long run. Technological Advancement: Nations are recognizing the transformative potential of blockchain technology and digital assets. Investing in Bitcoin can be seen as a strategic move to embrace and lead in this evolving technological landscape. Geopolitical Uncertainty: In times of global instability, Bitcoin’s borderless and censorship-resistant nature makes it an attractive alternative to traditional reserve assets, which can be subject to political influence. China’s Strategic Bitcoin Interests: A U-Turn? China’s potential consideration of a China Bitcoin buying strategy is particularly noteworthy, given the nation’s past stance on cryptocurrencies. China was once a dominant force in Bitcoin mining and trading, but a series of regulatory crackdowns led to a near-total ban on crypto-related activities. So, why the potential shift? Several factors could be at play: Economic Diversification: China’s economy, while robust, faces various challenges. Diversifying into alternative assets like Bitcoin could be a strategic move to reduce reliance on traditional markets and the US dollar. Technological Leadership: Despite the crypto ban, China has been actively exploring blockchain technology. Accumulating Bitcoin could be a way to indirectly engage with the crypto space and maintain a foothold in this burgeoning technology. Geopolitical Leverage: In a world increasingly divided, holding a significant amount of Bitcoin could provide China with new forms of economic and geopolitical leverage. Potential Policy Shift: The reports suggest a potential re-evaluation of China’s crypto policies. A shift towards a more pragmatic approach, allowing for controlled Bitcoin accumulation, might be under consideration. It’s crucial to remember that this is still in the realm of consideration and reports. A full-scale policy reversal and official China Bitcoin buying strategy would require significant regulatory changes and political will. However, even the possibility is enough to send shockwaves through the market. Middle East’s Emerging Bitcoin Appetite: Beyond Oil? The Middle East, traditionally known for its oil wealth, is increasingly looking towards diversifying its economies and embracing future-forward technologies. A Middle East Bitcoin buying strategy aligns perfectly with this vision. Here’s why nations in the Middle East might be considering Bitcoin: Economic Diversification: Many Middle Eastern countries are actively seeking to reduce their dependence on oil revenues. Investing in Bitcoin and the broader digital asset ecosystem is a way to diversify their sovereign wealth funds and future-proof their economies. Innovation Hubs: Several Middle Eastern nations, like the UAE and Bahrain, are positioning themselves as innovation hubs, particularly in fintech and blockchain. Embracing Bitcoin is a natural extension of this ambition. Young and Tech-Savvy Population: The Middle East boasts a young and tech-savvy population that is increasingly interested in cryptocurrencies. Government adoption of Bitcoin could cater to this demographic and foster local talent in the digital asset space. Strategic Investments: Sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East are known for making strategic, long-term investments. Bitcoin, with its potential for long-term growth, fits this investment profile. The Middle East Bitcoin interest is perhaps less surprising than China’s, given the more welcoming regulatory environments in some Middle Eastern countries towards cryptocurrencies. However, coordinated and large-scale institutional Bitcoin buying from these nations would still be a game-changer. Challenges and Considerations of a Bitcoin Buying Strategy While the prospect of nations adopting a Bitcoin buying strategy is exciting, it’s essential to acknowledge the challenges and considerations involved: Challenge Description Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility remains a concern for institutional investors and nations alike. Large-scale buying could exacerbate price swings in the short term. Regulatory Uncertainty: Global regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies are still evolving. Nations considering Bitcoin investment would need to navigate complex and often inconsistent regulations. Custody and Security: Securing and storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust custody solutions and security protocols. Nations would need to develop or adopt institutional-grade custody solutions. Market Manipulation: The cryptocurrency market, while maturing, is still susceptible to manipulation. Large-scale institutional buying could be strategically timed to minimize market impact and avoid price manipulation. Geopolitical Implications: Nation-state involvement in Bitcoin could have complex geopolitical implications, potentially leading to new forms of digital currency competition and influence. These challenges are not insurmountable, but they highlight the need for careful planning, robust risk management, and strategic execution for any nation considering a significant institutional Bitcoin investment. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Market? The potential for China and Middle Eastern nations to adopt a Bitcoin buying strategy has profound implications for the Bitcoin market and the broader crypto ecosystem. Here are some actionable insights: Potential Bullish Catalyst: Large-scale institutional buying from nations would inject significant capital into the Bitcoin market, potentially driving up prices and triggering a new bull market phase. Increased Legitimacy: Sovereign wealth fund and government involvement would further legitimize Bitcoin as a mainstream asset class, attracting more institutional and retail investors. Long-Term Price Appreciation: If nations adopt a long-term Bitcoin accumulation strategy, it would reduce the available supply of Bitcoin, potentially leading to significant long-term price appreciation. Market Volatility: In the short term, news and rumors surrounding nation-state Bitcoin buying could increase market volatility. Traders should be prepared for potential price swings. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased institutional and national involvement will likely lead to greater regulatory scrutiny of the Bitcoin market, potentially resulting in new regulations and compliance requirements. Astounding as it may seem, the prospect of China and Middle Eastern nations considering a Bitcoin strategy is a monumental development. It signals a potential paradigm shift in how nations view and interact with digital assets. While still in the early stages, this news warrants close attention. If these reports materialize, we could be on the cusp of a new era for Bitcoin and the global financial system.

With this new development, the digital asset service provider hopes to provide ‘Binancians’ more opportunities in the crypto sector. Binance Users Need BNB to Vote The Centralized Exchange (CEX) intends to encourage democracy among its users. Users can upvote a project for listing in the Alpha Observation Zone or downvote a token for delisting via the Monitoring Zone. However, for any Binancian to be eligible to vote, he must hold a minimum of 0.01 (BNB). Binance is enhancing its listing mechanism and introducing its new Community Co-Governance Mechanism for Listings. The ‘Vote to List’ and ‘Vote to Delist’ mechanisms will enable greater community participation and give users a stronger voice in the listing process.

Also, “For projects that have completed their TGE (Token Generation Event) for some time but are not yet in the Alpha Observation Zone, we will be introducing a self-nomination application method, with details to be announced at a later stage,” Binance announced. Raised Concerns About Binance’s Token Listings In 2024, Binance caught the token listing fever, backed by the ongoing memecoin mania. The exchange-listed several tokens, including those added to its LaunchPool. Amidst these massive listings, there were concerns about the unclear listing criteria, with certain entities suggesting that projects may have lobbied their way through to Binance. Recently, Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao “CZ” highlighted the “broken” state of CEXes token listings. Furthermore, he pointed to the problematic short window between token announcements and listings on major exchanges. He has observed how the rapid four-hour time frame on Binance triggers price distortions. CZ Offers Advice to CEXes on Token Listings CZ encouraged CEXes to consider automating their listing processes, similar to decentralized exchanges (DEXs), to address his concerns. One decentralized launch that has left the crypto community buzzing is that of Hyperliquid (HYPE). Its fair launch model, which staged a record-breaking airdrop worth over $7.5 billion, has earned it the tag of a potential game changer. Analysts believe that this model can facilitate more transparent and equitable token listings, which may eventually challenge traditional CEX practices and processes.

41277307,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/us-bitcoin-strategic-reserve-catalyst-or-sell-the-news,1741381932,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/41277307.jpeg,U.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve - catalyst or sell the news?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/us-bitcoin-strategic-reserve-catalyst-or-sell-the-news,"With the White House Crypto Summit due to take place later today, it has already been announced that President Trump has signed an executive order on Thursday to set up a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. With no commitment to add to the reserve by buying Bitcoin, will this just be a sell the news event, or will more details be forthcoming at the Crypto Summit? The leader of the most powerful nation on earth signed an executive order which establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and there is little response from the market. What is happening? What we know about the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will first assimilate all the Bitcoin that was seized in criminal forfeiture cases over the years. This amounts to roughly 200,000 BTC, although no complete audit has ever been published. President Trump’s executive order and remarks in Crypto Czar David Sack’s X post on the subject, state that no Bitcoin can be sold out of the Reserve, and that it will remain as a store of value, much like in the case of the gold stored at Fort Knox. While there is no mention so far of the government actually buying Bitcoin in order to add to its holdings, Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy, replied to Sack’s post with the following: “I have a few budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin…” This will no doubt be discussed at Friday’s Crypto Summit, to which Michael Saylor has a confirmed invite. In a previous post on Truth Social, President Trump also said that some cryptocurrencies would also be held by the government. These included Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). Although it has since been revealed that these will be kept in a Digital Asset Stockpile, separate from the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. With all this very positive news, why is the market showing such lukewarm interest? Why the lack of market interest? The problem is that the market already knows about the 200,000 BTC that the government holds. It also knows about the upcoming Crypto Summit, and it also knows that the government has said that it will not buy any extra Bitcoin using taxpayer money (although there is the possibility that extra Bitcoin could be purchased by selling other assets, or even by issuing bonds). Therefore, unless budget-neutral strategies are successfully adopted, or perhaps an exclusion from capital gains tax is determined, market makers could have a great opportunity to manipulate the market as per a sell the news event. Current $BTC price action contained within a triangle pattern Source: TradingView Probably the best way to draw the recent price action on the 4-hour $BTC chart is inside of a triangle pattern. This pattern could continue for another few days, but given that it's $BTC, a breakout would probably come earlier, and that could even be later on Friday. If the price breaks up, it has the chance to also break above the major ascending trendline, while if it breaks down, this could be the much heralded descent to the $73,000 support, and perhaps as far down as $69,000, which, as the top of the last bull market, has become extremely strong support. Breakout is imminent - but up or down? Source: TradingView Zooming out into the daily time frame, one can see how each of the recent falls in price were bought up very quickly, leaving quite long candle wicks below, which form the bottom of the current triangle. The price has managed to get above the $89,000 level, potentially turning it into support. At the bottom of the chart, the RSI could be key. The long downtrend in the indicator line stretches back to mid-November of 2024. This will need to be broken to the upside. After the lowest drop for this indicator since August 2023, a breakout bounce could be imminent. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to the data, the illegal marketplace Nucleus Marketplace, which owns a total of $400 million in Bitcoin, emerged from a 9-year dormancy a few minutes ago and transferred $77.5 million worth of BTC to 3 new wallets. The antique marketplace still has $365 million worth of BTC in its wallets. Nucleus Marketplace was an illegal drug marketplace on the darknet that shut down in 2016 after its founder was caught by law enforcement or to avoid fraud charges. Related News: White House Official Makes Very Confusing Statement About Cardano (ADA), Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) - Bringing a Drop The Bitcoins in the wallets owned by the marketplace have not been moved since then. It is not yet known what the activation of the wallets means. However, an important cryptocurrency summit will be held in the US today, and earlier in the day, Donald Trump signed an executive order that will add the BTCs seized so far to the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This suggests the possibility that the founder of the illegal marketplace has been caught by the US and that the assets are in the hands of the US government, as unconfirmed information. *This is not investment advice.

These digital entities, designed to mimic human interaction, are becoming increasingly sophisticated, offering users everything from friendly chats to romantic partnerships. But as we venture further into this AI-driven social frontier, are we losing sight of something crucial? Social health expert Kasley Killam raises a vital alarm: leaning too heavily on AI companions could seriously jeopardize our real-world social connections and overall social health . The Rise of AI Companions: A Digital Embrace? The allure of AI relationships is undeniable. Imagine having a companion available 24/7, one that listens without judgment, always agrees with you, and never has a bad day. For some, this is not just a fantasy; it’s becoming a reality. Apps offering AI companions are booming, evidenced by a staggering 652% year-over-year revenue growth in 2024, raking in $55 million. But is this digital embrace truly fulfilling our need for connection, or is it creating a void in our real-world social connections ? Killam, author of “The Art and Science of Connection,” and a Harvard School of Public Health graduate, brings a crucial perspective to this discussion. Speaking at SXSW, she acknowledged potential benefits, such as using AI for practicing social skills. However, her message is clear: AI should augment, not replace, human interaction. But what are the real concerns? Are AI Companions a Threat to Social Health? Killam’s skepticism isn’t about dismissing AI entirely. It’s about understanding the potential pitfalls of over-reliance. Here’s a breakdown of her key concerns: Erosion of Real-World Social Skills: While AI can simulate conversations, true social skills are honed through messy, unpredictable, and deeply human interactions. Can practicing with an AI truly prepare you for the nuances of a real-life conversation, with all its non-verbal cues and emotional complexities? Dependence and Isolation: The sheer number of people using AI as primary companions – “hundreds of millions” according to Killam’s research – is alarming. Are we creating a society where people turn to AI because they feel unable to connect with real humans? This could exacerbate existing loneliness and social isolation. Distorted View of Relationships: AI companions are designed to be agreeable and supportive. Real relationships are not always smooth; they involve disagreements, compromises, and navigating different personalities. Relying solely on AI could lead to unrealistic expectations of human relationships. Killam poignantly asks, “I’m concerned that we have created a culture where people feel like they need to turn to AI for companionship.” This is a powerful statement that reflects a deeper societal issue – are we becoming less equipped to connect with each other? The Potential Benefits: AI as a Social Tool? It’s not all doom and gloom. Killam also sees potential upsides to digital interaction with AI. Here are some possible benefits: Social Skill Practice: For individuals with social anxiety or those looking to improve conversation skills, AI can be a low-pressure environment to practice. It can be a safe space to rehearse scenarios and build confidence before engaging in real-world interactions. Supplement, Not Substitute: Killam emphasizes that AI can be part of a “portfolio” of social health sources. If used as an addition to, not a replacement for, human connections, AI could offer supplementary support and interaction. Accessibility and Inclusivity: For individuals with limited social access due to geographical constraints, disabilities, or social circumstances, AI companions might offer a form of connection and interaction that would otherwise be unavailable. However, the crucial caveat remains: moderation and balance are key. Just as relying solely on fast food is detrimental to physical health, relying solely on AI for social interaction can be detrimental to social health . Actionable Insights: Navigating the AI Social Frontier So, how do we navigate this new era of AI relationships without compromising our social health ? Here are some actionable insights inspired by Killam’s perspective: Prioritize Real-World Connections: Make a conscious effort to nurture your existing relationships and build new ones in the real world. Schedule regular meetups with friends, family, and colleagues. Digital Detox and Balance: Be mindful of your digital consumption. Instead of mindlessly scrolling through social media or engaging with AI for extended periods, allocate time for face-to-face interactions. Use AI Intentionally: If you choose to use AI companions , do so with intention and awareness. Use them as tools for practice or supplementary interaction, not as replacements for genuine human connection. Invest in Social Skills: Actively seek opportunities to improve your real-world social skills. Join clubs, attend workshops, or simply initiate conversations with people around you. Recognize the Difference: Understand the fundamental difference between interacting with an AI and a human. AI can simulate conversation, but it lacks empathy, genuine emotion, and the unpredictable beauty of human connection. The Path Forward: Augment, Don’t Replace Kasley Killam’s warning is a timely and crucial reminder. As we embrace the advancements in AI, we must not lose sight of the fundamental human need for genuine social connections . AI companions can be intriguing tools, offering potential benefits for practicing social skills and providing supplementary interaction. However, they are not, and should never become, replacements for the rich, complex, and essential tapestry of human relationships. Our social health depends on maintaining a balance – using technology to augment, not replace, the vital connections that make us human.

The real question isn’t about which cryptocurrency is trending—it’s about which one is solving real problems, driving adoption, and setting the foundation for long-term success. Three projects stand out right now: Qubetics , Sonic, and Tezos. These aren’t just hype-driven tokens; they’re reshaping the industry in ways that will define the future of digital finance. Qubetics is leading the charge in interoperability, breaking down the barriers between different blockchains.

Qubetics: Breaking Barriers with Blockchain Interoperability Qubetics is revolutionizing how blockchains communicate. Until now, most blockchain networks operated in isolation, limiting their usability and making cross-chain transactions slow, expensive, and complex. This breakthrough eliminates fragmentation, making it easier for businesses, developers, and financial institutions to interact across different networks without friction. A business looking to integrate blockchain payments no longer has to choose between Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or another network. Qubetics makes it possible to work across multiple chains effortlessly. Developers can create decentralized applications that function across different networks, maximizing user adoption and reducing development costs. Financial institutions can facilitate faster, more efficient transactions without intermediaries, unlocking new possibilities in digital finance and cementing itself as top cryptos for massive growth. Numbers prove its momentum. Qubetics is in its 24th crypto presale stage, with over $14.6 million raised and more than 496 million $TICS tokens sold. Over 22,400 token holders have already joined the movement, signaling strong confidence in its vision. Post-presale, if $TICS reaches $1, early participants could see a 924% ROI, and a rise to $10 after the mainnet launch could yield a staggering 10,137% ROI. With its focus on interoperability, security, and scalability, Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain—it’s the infrastructure that will power the future of decentralized finance. Sonic: Expanding Beyond Speed and Into Industry Innovation Sonic is more than just a household name in gaming—it’s a brand that continuously reinvents itself. Right now, it’s making waves in multiple industries, proving that its reach extends far beyond the world of entertainment. Its ability to stay relevant in a competitive market highlights the strength of the Sonic name. Sonic is stepping into the world of cross-industry collaborations. The upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog x DC Comics crossover is one of the most ambitious projects yet, merging two iconic universes in a limited five-issue series. This crossover isn’t just about storytelling—it’s about brand expansion, bringing Sonic into the mainstream conversation in new ways. Sonic continues to evolve, making it a standout project with long-term potential. Unlike other brands that struggle to remain relevant, Sonic’s diversified expansion strategy makes it a top contender for massive growth in the digital space. Tezos: The Blockchain That Evolves With the Market On March 7, 2025, Tezos is hosting a major community call on YouTube, featuring insights from Nomadic Labs on the latest protocol developments. This isn’t just a routine update—it’s a testament to Tezos’ commitment to ongoing innovation. As the market evolves, Tezos evolves with it, ensuring that its blockchain remains efficient, scalable, and developer-friendly. At its core, Tezos operates on Liquid Proof of Stake (LPoS), a model that balances decentralization with security. Anyone with over 6,000 XTZ can become a “baker,” helping to validate transactions and secure the network. This system keeps Tezos resilient and adaptable, qualities that are essential for long-term blockchain sustainability. Currently trading at $0.77, Tezos has held strong despite market fluctuations. Some analysts expect significant price movement in the coming months, but more importantly, its commitment to self-improvement ensures that it remains a leading blockchain in 2025 and top cryptos for massive growth. Why These Cryptos Are Poised for Massive Growth Not every crypto project has what it takes to thrive long-term, but Qubetics, Sonic, and Tezos are proving their staying power. Qubetics is breaking barriers in blockchain interoperability, creating seamless connections between networks. Sonic is a cryptocurrency inspired by the classic video game character, designed to offer lightning-fast and enjoyable transactions. Tezos remains one of the most adaptable blockchain platforms, ensuring it can withstand market shifts while continuously improving. Each of these projects brings something unique to the table, and their recent developments highlight why they’re among the top cryptos for massive growth this month. With Qubetics’ presale gaining traction, Sonic’s cross-industry expansion, and Tezos’ governance-driven evolution, the time to watch these projects isn’t tomorrow—it’s today.

""I know that many of you have been fighting for years for this, and it's an honor to be with you at the White House,"" Trump said as the White House meeting got underway. In his brief statement, Trump said he would end his predecessor's “war on crypto,” praised lawmakers' legislative efforts and discussed his new Bitcoin reserve. “Regulators strong armed banks. I mean, they really did – They strong armed banks into closing the accounts of crypto businesses and entrepreneurs, effectively blocking some money transfers to and from exchanges, and they weaponized government against the entire industry,” Trump said. ""But I know that feeling also maybe better than you do. All of that will soon be over and we are ending Operation Chokepoint 2.0."" Trump said he wanted to sign stablecoin legislation before Congress breaks for the August recess. ""I also want to express my strong support for the efforts of lawmakers in Congress as they work on bills to provide regulatory certainty for dollar-backed stablecoins and the digital assets market,"" he said. ""They're working very hard on that. This is a tremendous opportunity for economic growth and innovation in our financial sector, and will really go a long way."" Referring to his Thursday executive order creating a Bitcoin reserve, Trump said it was ""foolish"" that the federal government had already sold so much of its seized Bitcoin ""The federal government is already among the largest holders of Bitcoin, as you know, really one of the largest holders in the world, with as many as 200,000 Bitcoin obtained via civil law and various other forms of law, including enforcement actions,"" he said. ""These existing holdings will form the foundation of the new reserve."" ""From this day on, America will follow the rule that every Bitcoiner knows very well, never sell your Bitcoin,"" he said. Wide swaths of the industry were represented by the guest list, which included top executives of Coinbase, Ripple, Kraken, Gemini, Chainlink, Robinhood and many others, representing the most formal-looking crypto group since the black-tie ball celebrating Trump's election victory. Tyler and Cameron Winkelvoss of Gemini, and Sergey Nazarov of Chainlink were among those who spoke during the live-streamed portion of the summit. Earlier on Friday, a senior White House official further clarified the administration's position on its bitcoin reserve and the secondary crypto stockpile that Trump's order is meant to establish. The official said that the U.S. government has an estimated 200,000 bitcoin to start the reserve and will be conducting an audit to figure out the specific holdings, and any non-bitcoin seizures will be maintained in the other stockpile. No new money will be put into non-bitcoin assets, and any active future investments in bitcoin will have to be worked out in a way that doesn't use tax dollars, the official said. The afternoon summit was largely meant to set a tone from the administration, which has sought to quickly put digital assets on friendlier footing than the industry experienced during the administration of former President Joe Biden.",Policy|White House,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|EXCHANGE|LINK,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-07 21:19:53

41298264,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=138230,1741382717,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking AI Siri Delay: Apple’s Personalized Assistant Upgrade Pushed Back,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-siri-delay-apple-upgrade/,"In a surprising turn of events for the tech world, Apple has announced a delay in the rollout of its much-anticipated, AI-powered, “more personalized Siri” experience. This upgrade, a cornerstone of Apple Intelligence, was initially slated to revolutionize how users interact with their devices. However, as per a statement published on Friday by Daring Fireball, the tech giant has admitted that delivering these advanced Siri features will “take us longer than we thought.” The rollout is now projected for the “coming year,” leaving many wondering about the implications of this AI Siri Delay . Why is the AI Siri Delay a Setback for Apple Intelligence? Announced with considerable fanfare at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, the enhanced Siri was positioned as a game-changer. CEO Tim Cook himself touted it as the “next big step for Apple,” emphasizing its ability to understand personal context – relationships, routines, and communications. This wasn’t just artificial intelligence, but “personal intelligence,” designed to be deeply integrated and intuitive. The delay throws a wrench into Apple’s plans for Apple Intelligence , potentially impacting the initial user experience and perception of this broader AI initiative. Let’s break down what was promised and what’s now on hold: Personalized Understanding: Siri was meant to evolve beyond basic commands, learning and adapting to individual user habits and relationships. This would enable more context-aware and relevant responses. Proactive Actions Across Apps: The upgrade aimed to make Siri more proactive, capable of performing tasks within and across different applications, streamlining user workflows. Enhanced User Experience: By becoming more personalized and proactive, Siri was expected to transform from a sometimes frustrating digital assistant to a genuinely helpful and indispensable tool. The AI Siri Delay raises questions about Apple’s readiness in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. The pressure is mounting as competitors forge ahead with their own AI assistants, making this setback particularly significant. The Growing Pressure in the Personalized AI Assistant Race This announcement arrives at a critical juncture. Apple is increasingly perceived as lagging in the AI race, especially when juxtaposed with the rapid advancements of AI assistants like ChatGPT. Critics argue that Siri’s limitations have become starker in comparison, with users reporting inaccuracies in even basic factual queries. This has led to industry figures like technology investor M.G. Siegler questioning Siri’s relevance altogether, even suggesting a complete replacement with ChatGPT rather than just an augmentation. The pressure to deliver a competitive Personalized AI Assistant is immense, and this delay only intensifies the scrutiny on Apple. Here’s a glimpse into the competitive landscape: AI Assistant Key Features Current Perception Apple Siri (Current) Basic voice commands, limited context awareness Perceived as less capable compared to modern AI assistants Apple Siri (Delayed Upgrade) Personalized understanding, proactive actions, cross-app integration Anticipated to be a significant improvement, now delayed ChatGPT Advanced conversational AI, broad knowledge base, text generation Leading in AI capabilities, setting a high benchmark Google Assistant Strong integration with Google services, proactive information delivery Competitor with robust features and continuous improvements The delay in Apple’s Digital Assistant Upgrade underscores the complexities of developing advanced AI. Creating a truly personalized and intuitive AI assistant requires overcoming significant technical hurdles, and Apple’s admission of needing more time reflects these challenges. What Does This Mean for Users and the Future of Apple’s AI? For Apple users eagerly awaiting a smarter Siri, the AI Siri Delay is undoubtedly disappointing. It means continuing to rely on a digital assistant that, while functional, hasn’t kept pace with the rapid advancements in AI. However, it also suggests that Apple is prioritizing quality and functionality over a rushed release. Taking more time to refine the Personalized AI Assistant could ultimately lead to a more polished and impactful product when it finally arrives. Key Takeaways from the AI Siri Delay: Patience Required: Users will need to wait longer for the promised Siri upgrade, likely into the next year. Quality Focus: The delay indicates Apple’s commitment to delivering a robust and effective AI experience, rather than a premature launch. Competitive Pressure: Apple faces increasing pressure to catch up in the AI assistant space, making the eventual success of this upgrade crucial. Future Expectations: When the upgraded Siri finally launches, expectations will be exceptionally high, given the anticipation and the competitive landscape. In conclusion, the AI Siri Delay is a notable setback for Apple’s AI ambitions, highlighting the challenges in developing cutting-edge personalized AI. While disappointing for users in the short term, a delayed but refined and powerful Personalized AI Assistant could be more beneficial in the long run, allowing Apple to deliver on its promise of a truly intelligent and helpful Siri. The tech world will be watching closely to see how Apple navigates this delay and ultimately delivers on its vision for the future of AI.

According to Sacks, Trump mentioned these assets in his earlier statement due to their ranking among the top five largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. “I think the president just gave five examples of cryptocurrencies in his post. Those five have to be the largest by market cap,” Sacks told reporters ahead of Friday’s White House Crypto Summit. “I think people are reading into that a little bit too much. The bottom line is, I think that what we’ve announced here is consistent with what the president has always said about the space.” Data from CoinGecko shows that the senior White House official’s assertion isn’t exactly correct. Excluding the two largest stablecoins — Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC — the five biggest cryptocurrencies by market value are Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Binance’s BNB, and SOL. ADA holds the eighth position on the crypto leaderboard. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve vs. Crypto Stockpile On March 6, Trump signed an order directing his administration to create a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, capitalized with the U.S. government’s seized bitcoin holdings. While Bitcoin is in a league of its own in the newly announced strategic reserve, other cryptocurrencies seized by the U.S. government in civil and criminal forfeitures will be pooled to create a separate Digital Assets Stockpile. As ZyCrypto has previously covered, some in the industry questioned the inclusion of XRP, ADA, and SOL to the national stockpile, citing the lack of developer activity and decentralization witnessed in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Sacks said they are “not sure” whether the federal government owns any of these altcoins, reiterating the EO’s call for a full audit of its current reserves. “In terms of what we’ll actually have, we have to do the accounting,” he opined. “We know it owns Bitcoin. I believe it owns some Ethereum. I’m not sure about the other ones. No one’s able to give us a straight answer yet.” After the auditing, the Secretary of the Treasury and their team would be entrusted with portfolio management, making sure the assets are handled in a way that serves the long-term interests of the American people. Sacks revealed that this could entail numerous financial strategies, including staking, rebalancing, or even selling certain assets at the Treasury Secretary’s discretion. “And yes, that could include staking, it could include rebalancing, [and] it could include sales,” Sacks explained. “These are all options they can pursue if the Secretary of the Treasury believes these are in the long-term interest of the American people.” Notably, Sacks recently lamented the U.S. government’s sale of Bitcoin , noting that it had so far lost out on a staggering $17 billion in value by selling confiscated BTC.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano|Ripple|SOL|Solana|XRP News,EN,0,0,ADA|SOL|BTC|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-07 21:26:42

To read full editions, subscribe . The Solana world has worked itself into a frenzy over SIMD-0228, a proposal to change Solana’s inflation mechanism. It’s either a ploy to destroy Solana’s decentralization or will only fail to pass due to CIA-style sabotage. I was sure voting on the proposal would be pushed back, but as far as I can tell, voting is still slated to begin in Solana epoch 753 at around 8:30 pm ET. Helius CEO Mert Mumtaz, Blockworks Research data lead Dan Smith, and yours truly broke the proposal down in this week’s Lightspeed podcast roundup episode . SIMD-0228 proponents say Solana is overpaying for security and market-based mechanisms are more efficient, while detractors say the reduction of issuance rewards could centralize the network’s power. My editors tell me I need to add analysis to my reporting on the news, however, so I’ll give you my take. Although network centralization is a concern — MEV tips will contribute proportionately more REV, so Jito will have relatively more power, for instance — what’s more important is that Solana doesn’t lose the scrappy pragmatism that made it so popular in the first place. Issuance is probably too high, and validator revenue should start coming from real value creation in the form of MEV and priority fees. SIMD-0228 should probably pass. We’ll have more to say on that next week, but I think there’s an even more interesting conversation to be had around SIMD-0096, a move to stop burning half of Solana priority fees that was implemented in February . Since 100% of the fees now go to validators, Solana’s inflation has climbed a bit — from 3.7% to 4.6% on an annualized basis, Blockworks Research analyst Carlos Gonzalez Campo told me on this week’s other Lightspeed podcast episode . That’s a predictable outcome. But what I found interesting is how unpredictable parts of the response to SIMD-0096 going live has been. If users and validators were perfectly rational, then users should have started paying fewer priority fees, Campo said. That’s because Solana removed what was essentially a 50% tax on fee revenue, so validators could charge half as much for fees while generating as much revenue as before. But so far, priority fees have stayed constant — perhaps indicating that competition between users isn’t putting downward pressure on priority fees. On top of this, validator revenue from priority fees was proportionately lower after SIMD-0096 than it had been previously. Users made proportionately more use of MEV tips, and validators couldn’t get them to switch to paying priority fees instead. All of this is a little early to extrapolate absolute trends from, but it’s still interesting to note. Campo offered an interesting goalpost for SIMD-0096’s success: a reduction in the number of transaction processing units on Solana. TPUs are out of protocol services for transaction inclusion, and their proliferation adds developer complexity and overhead cost. SIMD-0096 — which was first pitched as a way to prevent side deals — could prevent new TPUs from coming to the network. Get the news in your inbox.

Bitcoin (BTC) Consolidates Below $90K Amid Multiple Active Catalysts Bitcoin price experienced volatile price action on Friday, bouncing within a 10% range from lows of $84,600 to $91,280 on the daily candle. Bitcoin briefly touched $91,200 following former President Donald Trump’s announcement of a Bitcoin strategic reserve policy, signaling a shift toward institutional adoption. However, the market reaction remained muted as investors digested a key caveat—the reserve will be funded with BTC acquired from open markets. This tempered bullish sentiment, preventing a sustained rally. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Action At the same time, Bitcoin ETFs saw another $134 million in total outflows on Thursday, reinforcing bearish sentiment. BTC price failing to breach the $92,000 resistance signals active selling pressure, despite broader institutional interest. Derivative markets reflected bearish sentiment, with $382 million in long positions liquidated, accounting for 73% of total losses. The sharp sell-off suggests that inflation concerns stemming from the latest Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report overshadowed optimism from Trump’s White House crypto summit. With traders reacting to macroeconomic uncertainty, BTC remains vulnerable to further downside risks over the weekend. Trump’s Latest Policies Unsettled Bitcoin Long-Term Investors Bitcoin long-term holders appear rattled amid conflicting market signals from President Donald Trump’s recent policy updates. On Thursday, Trump’s Crypto Czar, David Sack, confirmed an executive order mandating that expropriated BTC be added to the national strategic reserve. Despite this ostensibly bullish development, Bitcoin price dropped 5%, falling below $85,000 on Friday. The decline was driven by concerns over hawkish readings in the U.S. NFP report, which signaled rising inflationary risks due to Trump’s recently imposed trade tariffs. Bitcoin Age Consumed vs. BTC price The market reaction suggests that macroeconomic uncertainty is outweighing optimism around Trump’s pro-crypto agenda. Supporting this view, on-chain data indicates that Bitcoin’s recent downturn coincides with a significant spike in selling pressure from long-term investors. Santiment ’s Age Consumed metric, which tracks the total number of coins moved multiplied by their dormancy period, has recorded persistent spikes since Trump announced tariffs on February 25. As illustrated in the chart, Bitcoin Age Consumed surged to 29.4 million when the tariffs were first announced and has remained elevated. On Friday, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the latest NFP report , Age Consumed spiked again to 15.9 billion, marking a 450% increase from the 2.8 million recorded on February 6. This suggests that long-term investors are exiting positions amid growing macroeconomic uncertainty. Bitcoin Near-Term Outlook When long-held BTC floods the market, it increases short-term supply and heightens downside risks. This dynamic explains why Bitcoin has struggled to reclaim $92,000, despite Trump’s strategic reserve announcement fueling long-term optimism. Given current market conditions, Bitcoin traders may continue prioritizing short-term profit-taking over extended holding periods until macroeconomic fears subside. If selling pressure from long-term holders persists, BTC risks retesting the $82,000 support level before a potential recovery attempt. Bitcoin Price Forecast: BTC Eyes $92K as Volatility Persists Bitcoin price forecast chart below show that BTC is consolidating near $88,866, with bullish momentum attempting to reclaim $90,000. The Donchian Channel indicates a mid-range setup, with the upper boundary at $99,475 acting as resistance. A decisive breakout above this level could trigger a surge toward $102,500. However, the lower boundary at $78,258 suggests downside risks remain, especially amid recent volatility spikes. Volume analysis highlights a surge in buying pressure following BTC’s rebound from $84,667, reinforcing the bullish case. Yet, the declining bullish volume suggests waning momentum, which could prevent a clean break past $92,000. The Average Daily Range (ADR) at 1.25 signals heightened volatility, a key consideration for leveraged traders navigating the market. Bitcoin Price Forecast Despite the bullish recovery, BTC remains susceptible to a retracement if selling pressure intensifies. The recent 7.81% price swing underscores ongoing uncertainty, and a rejection from current levels could drive BTC back toward $87,000. The market remains in a critical phase, where leverage-driven liquidations could dictate near-term direction. A daily close above $91,200 would reinforce bullish strength, while failure to hold above $87,000 could expose Bitcoin to deeper corrections.

BREAKING: No capital gains tax exemptions are expected to be announced at the White House Crypto Summit. — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) March 7, 2025 During a virtual summit preview, a White House official stated that taxation would not be an issue for debate, contrary to what people had suggested. The summit will help industry leaders give regulatory feedback as a response to Trump’s intention to end Operation Chokepoint 2.0, an initiative reportedly designed to target the banks for financial restraints on cryptocurrency firms. “The president promised during the campaign to establish a crypto council. He wanted to take in advice and feedback from the industry. That is the purpose of the summit,” the official stated. The official also stated that in the federal government’s accounting system, Bitcoin will receive “special treatment.” Currently, any profits from cryptocurrencies in the United States are taxed similarly to stock profits. Short-term gains are taxed as high as 37% for assets held for less than a year, while long-term gains are taxed from 0% to 20% based on income levels. This taxation system is attractive especially to active crypto traders, especially the high-frequency ones. Without exceptions, investors may have to reconsider their strategies since the absence of a tax break may impact overall profitability. Internationally, Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party proposed plans to lower its high tax on cryptocurrency profits. The current rate of 55% could be reduced to 20% under the new proposal. Japanese officials seek to identify workable rules to adapt to economic strains including a larger government debt and increasing inflation. Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve This tax policy update follows President Donald Trump’s announcement of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The executive order creates the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which will be financed by Bitcoin received through criminal and civil asset forfeiture. White House crypto adviser David Sacks confirmed this in his tweet on X (formerly Twitter). Although the order allows for future Bitcoin acquisitions the order does not set out a roadmap towards immediate acquisitions. The Treasury and Commerce secretaries are further permitted to seek other ways of procuring more Bitcoin without incurring costs from the taxpayers. The administration distinguishes between the Bitcoin reserve and the broader digital asset stockpile, which includes other cryptocurrencies owned by the federal government. The purpose of the stockpile is to ensure responsible management of digital assets. The administration also differentiates between Bitcoin held in reserve and other digital assets that are stored in the federal government’s inventory. This way the stockpile helps to manage digital assets in an efficient and proper manner. The executive order has been a subject of controversy. Some market participants hoped for a bolder approach to purchasing additional Bitcoin. However, the administration’s approach remains relatively conservative but receptive to cryptocurrency.

Let’s delve into the details of this developing story and understand its potential implications for the digital asset landscape. Why Senator Lummis’ Absence from the Crypto Summit is a Significant Setback Senator Cynthia Lummis’s voice in the cryptocurrency space is not just influential; it’s considered pivotal. As a vocal proponent of Bitcoin and a champion for sensible digital asset regulation, her presence at the White House crypto summit was eagerly anticipated. Her absence, therefore, is more than just a personal matter; it carries weight within the ongoing dialogue between the crypto industry and policymakers. Why is her participation so crucial? Deep Understanding of Digital Assets: Senator Lummis isn’t just another politician dabbling in crypto. She has demonstrated a deep understanding of Bitcoin and the broader digital asset ecosystem. Her insights are grounded in knowledge, not just fleeting trends. Legislative Influence: She has been actively involved in crafting and pushing forward Bitcoin legislation and regulations that aim to foster innovation while providing necessary consumer protection. Her absence removes a key advocate from direct discussions at a critical juncture. Bridge Between Crypto and Washington: Senator Lummis effectively bridges the gap between the often-misunderstood world of cryptocurrency and the traditional halls of Washington D.C. Her ability to articulate the benefits and nuances of digital assets to her colleagues is invaluable. While details about the senator’s illness remain private, her message on X (formerly Twitter) clearly indicates her continued dedication. She stated her commitment to pushing forward digital asset legislation , aiming to get it to President Trump’s desk. This message, while reassuring, underscores the void felt by her absence at such a crucial event. Understanding the White House Crypto Summit: What’s at Stake? The White House crypto summit itself is a significant event, signaling a growing recognition from the executive branch regarding the importance of the cryptocurrency industry. These summits are designed to bring together industry leaders, policymakers, and regulators to discuss the current state of crypto, address challenges, and explore future pathways. What are the key objectives and why is Senator Lummis’s input particularly missed in this setting? Summit Objective Why Lummis’s Input Matters Policy Discussion: To discuss and shape future crypto policy and regulations. Her expertise in crafting balanced and effective Bitcoin legislation is crucial for informed policy decisions. Industry Engagement: To foster dialogue between the government and the crypto industry. Her established relationships and credibility within the crypto community would have facilitated more open and productive discussions. Innovation and Growth: To explore ways to support innovation and responsible growth within the digital asset space. Her pro-innovation stance and understanding of the potential of digital assets are vital for charting a growth-oriented path. The summit represents an opportunity to address critical questions surrounding regulation, innovation, and consumer protection in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Senator Lummis’s absence means a loss of a powerful voice advocating for a balanced approach – one that encourages growth while mitigating risks. The Broader Implications for Bitcoin and Digital Asset Legislation Senator Lummis’s commitment to advancing Bitcoin legislation is well-documented. She has been instrumental in proposing and supporting bills aimed at clarifying the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, fostering innovation, and ensuring the United States remains competitive in the global digital economy. What are the potential ramifications of her temporary setback on these legislative efforts? Momentum Slowdown: Her absence, even temporarily, could slow down the momentum of ongoing legislative efforts. Navigating the complex world of Washington D.C. requires consistent and persistent advocacy. Potential for Misinterpretation: In the fast-paced world of crypto news, her absence could be misinterpreted as a sign of weakening support for crypto within political circles, which is far from the truth based on her public statement. Increased Reliance on Other Advocates: Her absence underscores the need for a broader coalition of pro-crypto voices within the Senate and House. It highlights the importance of diverse representation and shared advocacy. Despite this temporary setback, Senator Lummis’s unwavering commitment, as expressed in her message, offers a sense of optimism. Her dedication to bringing digital assets to the forefront of legislative discussions remains a crucial factor in shaping the future of crypto in the U.S. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto Legislation and Senator Lummis’s Role What can we expect in the coming months regarding crypto legislation, and what role will Senator Lummis play upon her return? The crypto community is keenly watching for signals and developments. Here are some key areas to consider: Continued Legislative Push: Expect Senator Lummis to resume her active role in pushing for clear and sensible crypto regulations as soon as she recovers. Her commitment remains steadfast. Focus on Bipartisan Support: Building bipartisan support for Bitcoin legislation is essential for its success. Senator Lummis has shown an ability to work across the aisle, and this will be crucial going forward. Industry Collaboration: Effective crypto regulation requires close collaboration between policymakers and the crypto industry. Senator Lummis understands this and is likely to continue fostering these partnerships. Senator Lummis’s illness and absence from the White House crypto summit serve as a reminder of the human element within the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency and policy. Her dedication to advancing responsible and innovative crypto legislation remains a beacon of hope for the industry. The crypto community eagerly awaits her return and continued leadership in shaping the future of digital assets in the United States.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump is set to deliver a public speech at 3 p.m. ET today. All eyes in the crypto world are glued to their screens as anticipation builds around what Trump might say, especially given the concurrent White House Crypto Summit. But here’s the twist – the summit is shrouded in secrecy, with no live broadcast planned. What does this mean for the future of digital assets and the broader cryptocurrency landscape? Let’s dive into the details and explore what’s unfolding. Why is Trump’s Crypto Speech Causing a Stir? The announcement of a public speech by Donald Trump always commands attention, but this one is particularly significant for the crypto community. Trump’s past stances on cryptocurrencies have been… let’s say, varied. From calling Bitcoin “thin air” to more recently hinting at a potential shift, his words carry weight and can significantly influence market sentiment. Given the ongoing discussions around crypto regulations and digital asset policy in Washington, any mention of these topics in his speech could trigger immediate market reactions. Traders and investors are keenly awaiting any signals regarding his current views and potential future policies, especially as the 2024 elections approach. This urgent situation demands close observation from anyone invested or interested in the crypto space. White House Crypto Summit: What’s Happening Behind Closed Doors? Adding another layer of intrigue to the day’s events is the White House Crypto Summit. While details are scarce and the summit isn’t being live-streamed, its very occurrence signals a serious engagement by the current administration with the cryptocurrency industry. Think about it – key figures from the crypto world, policymakers, and regulators are likely convening to discuss the most pressing issues facing the sector. What could be on the agenda at this closed-door White House Crypto Summit ? Speculation is rife, but potential topics include: Regulatory Frameworks: Developing clear and consistent rules for crypto businesses to operate within the U.S. Consumer Protection: Safeguarding investors from scams and market volatility in the crypto space. Innovation and Competitiveness: Ensuring the U.S. remains a hub for crypto innovation while balancing risks. National Security Concerns: Addressing the use of crypto for illicit activities and ensuring financial stability. The lack of transparency surrounding the summit has only amplified curiosity and speculation. Is the administration leaning towards stricter regulations, or are they exploring ways to foster responsible innovation? The outcomes of these discussions, even if not immediately public, will undoubtedly shape the future trajectory of the crypto industry in the United States and globally. Potential Topics of Trump’s Speech: Crypto Regulations and Digital Assets Policy Now, let’s turn our attention back to Trump’s speech. While we can only speculate, it’s highly probable that he will touch upon topics relevant to the White House Crypto Summit and the broader crypto landscape. Given his political background, it’s reasonable to expect comments on: Crypto Regulations: Will he advocate for a more lenient or stricter regulatory approach? His stance could significantly influence future legislation. Digital Assets Policy: What’s his vision for the role of digital assets in the U.S. economy? Does he see them as a threat or an opportunity? Economic Impact: How does he view the potential of cryptocurrencies to impact jobs, innovation, and financial markets? Geopolitical Implications: With other nations also vying for crypto leadership, will he address the U.S.’s position in the global crypto race? The market is particularly sensitive to any hints regarding crypto regulations . Clear regulatory frameworks are often seen as crucial for mainstream adoption, while overly restrictive rules could stifle innovation and push businesses overseas. Trump’s perspective on this balance will be keenly analyzed. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? Actionable Insights So, what are the potential implications of these events for the crypto market ? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Scenario Potential Market Reaction Actionable Insight Trump’s speech is pro-crypto, advocating for lighter regulations. Positive market surge, potential price rallies for major cryptocurrencies. Consider reviewing your portfolio and potentially increasing exposure to fundamentally strong crypto assets. Trump’s speech is anti-crypto, expressing skepticism or advocating for stricter regulations. Negative market correction, potential price dips and increased volatility. Exercise caution, consider risk management strategies, and potentially reduce exposure if you have a lower risk tolerance. Trump’s speech is neutral or avoids direct crypto commentary. Market may remain relatively stable in the short term, focusing on broader market trends and summit outcomes. Continue to monitor market developments, pay attention to news emerging from the White House Crypto Summit, and focus on long-term investment strategies. It’s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile. News events, especially those involving influential figures like Donald Trump, can trigger rapid price swings. Always conduct your own research, understand the risks involved, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Staying informed and adaptable is key to navigating the dynamic world of crypto. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Landscape Amidst Political Signals Today is shaping up to be a pivotal day for the cryptocurrency world. Donald Trump’s impending speech, coupled with the enigmatic White House Crypto Summit, has injected a dose of both excitement and uncertainty into the market. Whether these events will usher in a new era of clarity or further complicate the regulatory landscape remains to be seen. One thing is certain: staying informed, remaining agile, and understanding the potential impact of political signals are more critical than ever for anyone involved in the crypto space.

Token presales and ICOs offer investors a lifetime opportunity to participate in crypto projects before they grow into self-sustaining ecosystems. Early adopters usually get exclusive benefits by supporting the projects before they mature and in the process they get rewarded. BinoFi is a new DeFi project whose presale has taken crypto-savvy investors by storm. The project is running its first presale phase which sold 3 million of the allocated BINO tokens in 24 hours. BinoFi presale surges during its first ICO phase BinoFi is a new crypto exchange project with a hybrid operating model amalgamating the best features of centralized and decentralized crypto exchanges. The project leverages modern technology and artificial intelligence to boost user experience and create a conducive environment for crypto trading activities. BinoFi’s first presale phase has significantly attracted investors, leading to a 3 million BINO sell-out in just 24 hours. The project’s developers have scheduled a presale with the objective of distributing 2 billion BINO tokens at different prices depending on the presale phase. At the time of this publication, investors are purchasing BINO tokens at an average discounted price of just $0.02. BinoFi offers an exciting once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for new and experienced crypto investors to create wealth by investing in a solid project with real utility. Some say Buying BinoFi (BINO) at the current prices is like buying Bitcoin a decade ago. The tokens will retail for $0.038 when the presale reaches phase 10 and finally end phase 20 at an average price of $0.058. The team has set a launch price of $0.30. This implies that investors who participate in the project’s current phase will have gained 1200% at the launch price. A $1,000 investment will be worth $14,000 when the project launches. Imagine what a $10,000 investment would yield. BinoFi’s rewarding mechanism: What investors need The team behind the project’s development has set measures to encourage early participants to hold BINO tokens for the long term. The team will reward presale investors who stake their tokens once the token generation event ceases. The investors will receive additional staking rewards and presale bonuses for their early support and participation. The presale investors will also qualify to participate in early governance and decision-making of the project in the BinoFi decentralized autonomous organization. Investors will also receive additional trading benefits such as discounted trading fees when transacting on the BinoFi crypto exchange platform. Traders holding 10,000 BINO will receive a 10% fee discount on their trading fees while those who hold 40,000 BINO will receive a 25% cut on their trading fees. Investors holding 80,000 BINO will receive a 50% cut from their DEX and CEX transactions. The BinoFi developers are building a self-sustaining ecosystem with inbuilt revenue-generating activities. The business model is structured to generate income around the clock, providing sustainability even during harsh market conditions and crypto meltdowns. The platform’s primary revenue streams include trading fees paid by investors and traders. The platform charges a standard rate of between 0.10% and 0.25% per trade which varies depending on market conditions and liquidity.

Here’s the Best Crypto to Invest in Right Now—XRP, Cardano, or Web3Bay?",https://thecoinrise.com/got-3000-heres-the-best-crypto-to-invest-in-right-now-xrp-cardano-or-web3bay/,"When considering where to allocate $3,000 in the crypto market, should you opt for the established fintech player XRP, the smart contract leader Cardano, or the emerging e-commerce innovator Web3Bay? Each of these cryptocurrencies offers unique benefits and varying levels of risk and potential returns. XRP is carving a niche in traditional finance, Cardano is competing to surpass Ethereum’s capabilities, and Web3Bay (3BAY) is emerging as the standout presale project of 2025, with significant funding and token sales in its early stages. Let’s examine which of these could be the best crypto to invest in now. Cardano (ADA): Potential Versus Pace Cardano, with a market cap close to $27 billion, is celebrated for its detailed and methodical development approach, striving to outshine Ethereum by offering lower fees and faster transactions through a scientifically grounded roadmap. However, despite its potential, Cardano’s progress in expanding its ecosystem pales in comparison to that of Ethereum and Solana, which have quickly captured significant market shares. Current price: $0.64 Advantages: Low transaction fees, compatibility with advanced smart contracts, robust development team Challenges: Sluggish adoption rate, intense rivalry from Solana and Ethereum While Cardano shows promise, the real question for investors is its ability to significantly outpace its competitors, making it a more speculative long-term investment. XRP: A Financial Framework Pioneer XRP is making significant strides in global finance, especially in cross-border transactions, where it offers a faster and cheaper alternative to traditional SWIFT transfers. Its adoption is increasing among banks and financial institutions, enhancing transaction efficiency to mere seconds at minimal costs. Current price: $2.17 Advantages: Growing institutional adoption, cost-effective transfers, potential ETF developments Challenges: Regulatory scrutiny, competition from stablecoins and CBDCs For investors focusing on blockchain integration within mainstream finance, XRP presents a robust option, especially if the regulatory landscape stabilizes, potentially leading to substantial growth. Web3Bay: Transforming E-Commerce Among the newer entrants, Web3Bay is redefining e-commerce by challenging the dominance of giants like Amazon and eBay with a decentralized model. By eliminating intermediaries, Web3Bay allows sellers to retain full control over their profits and operations, which could fundamentally change online commerce by lowering fees and enhancing security for buyers and sellers. Presale achievements: Stage: 5 Funds Raised: $1.6 million Current Token Price: $0.00524 Projected Launch Price: $0.1959 (Potential ROI of 3,638%) Recent Whale Activity: Over $200K invested in 24 hours Why Web3Bay is Prominent: Massive Industry Disruption: Positioned to disrupt a $5.8 trillion market. Practical Benefits: Offers real, tangible user benefits, unlike speculative meme coins. Exceptional Growth Potential: Early investors gain access at a price that’s set to escalate. While XRP and Cardano provide stability and gradual growth, Web3Bay offers the most considerable potential for high returns, particularly appealing for those willing to invest in emerging high-growth areas. Where to Invest $3,000? Each crypto asset shines in its own right, but the optimal choice depends on your risk preference and investment objectives: For conservative investors: XRP, with its solid real-world application and institutional support. For those betting on blockchain innovation: Cardano offers potential but requires patience. For maximum growth potential: Web3Bay is the best crypto to invest in now , offering early access to a rapidly expanding market. As Web3Bay’s presale progresses and prices increase, getting in before the next price jump could be a strategic move. For those poised to capitalize on the future of decentralized e-commerce, Web3Bay presents the most lucrative opportunity in 2025.

Bankman-Fried also revived the drive to achieve a Presidential pardon, although he has not reached out to Trump directly. Sam Bankman-Fried may be seeking a pardon from US President Donald Trump. To that end, Bankman-Fried started to build an image of being a Republican supporter, and not actually a hardline Democrat. The entangled history of Bankman-Fried’s political donations may give him favor with both US parties. Data showed Bankman-Fried was in charge of as much as $100M in political donations during the heyday of FTX. The donations toward the Democratic party, however, did not translate into a Presidential pardon at the end of Joe Biden’s mandate. So the FTX founder chose to play the Republican card and try to pull a feat similar to Andrew Tate’s escape from his Eastern European confinement. A new effort is underway, as reported by the NY Times, to build a case for his freedom before President Trump. Bankman-Fried has gathered a group of supporters and consultants, headed by his parents, Mr. Bankman and Ms. Fried. The recent communication and PR campaign are trying to gain ground despite the previous political affiliations of Bankman-Fried, and his closeness to the US Democratic Party. The group is communicating with Kory Langhofer, an Arizona lawyer who worked on Trump’s 2016 and 2020 campaigns. Reportedly, the group around Bankman-Fried is also trying to tap Washington lobbyists and politically connected business people to present the case that FTX did not actually hurt its clients and was capable of paying back their claims. The process of getting Trump’s attention has already started, to the discontent of the crypto community. Without the pardon, Bankman-Fried faces a 25-year prison sentence for fraud against the company’s clients and lenders. Crypto and right-wing community speak against the pardon The idea of having Bankman-Fried walk free is still unpalatable to many. The FTX exchange not only caused personal losses to the tune of $16B but also traumatized the crypto market. After years of price stagnation, the effect of FTX was much deeper. Crypto community influencers saw a pattern in Bankman-Fried’s attempts to reverse course on his politics and spread his case about being a potential Republican asset. This has made crypto supporters and Trump fans see a pardon as deeply unfair. Bankman Fried is nowhere close to the fate of Ross Ulbricht or Aleksey Pertsev, whose main goal was privacy. For others, a Presidential pardon still has a slim chance, if Bankman-Fried decides to cooperate on any intriguing crypto uses by former Democrat donors. Bets suggest a pardon is highly unlikely Based on crowd decisions, a pardon for Bankman-Fried is highly unlikely. The prediction platform Polymarket, famous for correctly predicting the US election outcome before official sources, puts a pardon at a 5% probability. As talk about pardon lobbying accelerated, the ‘yes’ token inched up to $0.055, a minor addition. With nearly two months to go, the market may yet track the real potential for a Presidential pardon. Sam Bankman-Fried still has a relatively low chance at a pardon according to Polymarket bets. | Source: Polymarket The only market open on the issue is a list of potential pardons during the first 100 days of Donald Trump’s second presidential term. Bankman-Fried is a top selection, but there is no demand for ‘yes’ vote tokens, and the market has not reacted to the rumors. A pardon may take more than 100 days, and the betting market may be limited in its ability to predict the real outcome. As Trump is overwhelmed with an active war and trade issues, a former crypto tycoon may be a low priority in the first 100 days. Following Bankman-Fried’s interview with Tucker Carlson, others believe the process of seeking pardon will continue, with a probability of walking free by the end of the year. An unpopular pardon for Bankman-Fried would add to Trump’s inadvertent negative effects on the crypto market. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

In it, neural networks of human cells are formed on a silicon chip, representing an ”ever-evolving organic computer.” It allows ”code to run directly on real neurons and solve today's most complex problems.” ”CL1 is the first biological computer that allows medical and research labs to test how real neurons process information, offering an ethical alternative to animal testing and providing more relevant data and insights,” the project's website says. With CL1, researchers can study brain function ”with unprecedented clarity” through biological computations that capture the adaptability and learnability of neurons in real time, revealing disease mechanisms and the impact of connections on cognition. According to the developers, SBI is capable of fast and flexible learning, making it superior to silicon AI chips used to train existing large language models. ”Unlike traditional AI, our neural systems require minimal energy and training data to master complex tasks. This is not just a new computer. This is computing technology created anew,” the project's website says; Customers can buy CL1 outright or rent time with it, accessing it remotely via the cloud. Its mass rollout is expected in the second half of 2025. ”Today is the culmination of an idea that has driven Cortical Labs for almost six years. We have made some major breakthroughs in recent years [...],” commented Dr. Hong Weng Chong, founder and CEO of the startup.

President Donald Trump, during the crypto summit, unveiled a series of major initiatives aimed at reshaping the crypto landscape in America. With an audience of top executives from leading crypto companies including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Donald Trump made it clear that his administration is set to bring a new era of support for the digital asset industry. Donald Trump Promises End of Operation Chokepoint 2.0 One of the key announcements at the crypto summit was President Donald Trump’s pledge to end “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” This initiative had seen regulatory pressure on banks, leading them to close accounts of crypto businesses. Trump expressed strong disapproval of these actions, stating that the government had “weaponized” the banking system against the industry. He assured crypto CEOs that this era of resistance would soon be over, emphasizing that the government’s stance on crypto would now be more favorable. The president also called for continued legislative efforts to provide regulatory certainty for the crypto market, particularly regarding stablecoins. President Donald Trump highlighted the importance of stablecoin legislation, which he hopes to sign before Congress goes on its summer break in August. He noted that the growth and innovation in the financial sector would benefit from clear rules surrounding these assets. Many of the major players in the crypto space, including executives from Coinbase, Gemini, and Ripple, were present at the summit, reinforcing the industry’s support for these developments. Launch of Bitcoin Reserve Initiative A major highlight of the crypto summit was reflecting on the announcement of a strategic Bitcoin reserve by the President Donald Trump’s administration yesterday. The reserve will be seeded with Bitcoin already held by the U.S. government, largely obtained through criminal and civil asset forfeitures. The president referred to this reserve as a “digital Fort Knox for digital gold” and made it clear that the government would not sell the Bitcoin in its possession. This move is part of a broader strategy to position the U.S. as a leading nation in the cryptocurrency space. President Donald Trump stressed that holding Bitcoin would not only serve as a store of value but would also demonstrate the U.S.’s commitment to the digital asset ecosystem. “From this day on, America will follow the rule that every Bitcoiner knows very well: never sell your Bitcoin,” he said. The reserve is expected to play a significant role in the government’s strategy for managing its digital asset holdings. It is worth noting that the reserve’s creation does not involve taxpayer money, as the Bitcoin being held was obtained through non-taxpayer sources. Future Expansion of the U.S. Crypto Stockpile Alongside the Bitcoin reserve, Trump’s administration revealed plans to create a broader U.S. crypto stockpile . This stockpile will include digital assets beyond Bitcoin, with the U.S. government maintaining a reserve of assets seized through criminal or civil proceedings. Although Bitcoin is the primary focus for now, the government may consider adding other digital assets such as Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano in the future. The strategic intent behind these initiatives is to position the U.S. government to benefit from the long-term potential of digital assets. President Donald Trump’s administration views digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, as valuable for both economic growth and innovation. As part of the strategy, officials have also stated that no taxpayer funds will be used for future acquisitions of Bitcoin or other digital assets. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent mentioned that the reserve would begin with seized assets but could expand further depending on future government decisions. Concurrently, throughout the crypto summit, President Donald Trump expressed his support for legislative efforts aimed at clarifying the regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry. In addition, the president urged lawmakers to continue their efforts, acknowledging the importance of getting the regulatory landscape right to foster economic growth and innovation. However, not all reactions to the crypto summit were positive. Economist and financial commentator Peter Schiff, a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies, took to X to express his displeasure. He said; “The crypto summit is a disgrace. It’s a national embarrassment. The crypto faction that has captured the White House is precisely what our Founding Fathers warned us about. It will be a blight on whatever legacy Trump leaves and marks a low point for the presidency and the U.S.A.” The post Crypto Summit Highlights: Donald Trump Reveals Major Plans for Crypto industry appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Bitcoin Reserve|Digital Asset Summit|Donald Trump Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|ADA|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-03-07 22:05:05

That’s essentially what happened in the crypto world recently. A Bitcoin wallet , silent and inactive for nearly a decade, linked to the infamous Nucleus dark web marketplace , has sprung back to life. This isn’t just any wallet; it held a staggering $77.5 million worth of Bitcoin, now on the move after years of dormancy. Are you intrigued? Let’s delve into this mysterious crypto awakening. What’s the Buzz Around This Dormant Bitcoin Wallet? The crypto community is buzzing with the news that a dormant crypto wallet associated with the defunct Nucleus marketplace has been reactivated. Arkham Intelligence, a blockchain analytics firm, first spotted the unusual activity and shared it on X (formerly Twitter). For those unfamiliar, Nucleus was a notorious dark web marketplace , primarily known for facilitating the trade of illegal drugs. It abruptly shut down operations back in April 2016. Now, nearly nine years later, a significant amount of Bitcoin from a wallet linked to this marketplace is on the move. Here’s a quick rundown of the key facts: Wallet Reactivation: A Bitcoin wallet linked to Nucleus, dormant for about 9 years, has become active again. Massive Transaction: $77.5 million worth of Bitcoin was transferred. Destination Wallets: The funds were moved to three new, unknown wallets. Source of Information: Arkham Intelligence reported the activity based on blockchain analysis. Nucleus Marketplace: A dark web platform known for illegal drug trade, ceased operations in 2016. Decoding the Mystery of the Dark Web Marketplace Wallet The reactivation of this Bitcoin wallet raises a lot of questions. Why now? Who is behind this move? And what does it mean for the crypto landscape, especially concerning crypto money laundering and the legacy of dark web activities? Let’s try to unpack some of these questions. Why Reactivate After 9 Years? Nine years is a long time in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. Several potential reasons could be behind this reactivation: Long-Term Hodling Strategy: Perhaps the wallet owner was simply a very long-term holder, waiting for the right time to move their assets. With Bitcoin’s significant price appreciation over the years, $77.5 million today is considerably more valuable than it was in 2016. Market Opportunity: Recent market fluctuations or specific opportunities in the crypto market might have prompted the wallet holder to move their funds now. Operational Security Concerns: Holding such a large amount in a single, potentially identifiable wallet for so long could become a security risk. Moving the funds to new wallets could be a measure to enhance operational security and obfuscate the funds’ origin. Legal or Regulatory Pressure: It’s also possible that external pressures, perhaps related to regulatory scrutiny or legal investigations, could be forcing the wallet owner to move or liquidate these assets. Simple Access Recovery: While less dramatic, it’s also possible the owner simply regained access to the wallet after a long period of lost keys or forgotten passwords. However, given the scale and nature of the wallet’s history, this seems less likely. The Nucleus Marketplace Connection: What Does It Imply? The association with the Nucleus dark web marketplace adds a layer of complexity and concern. Dark web marketplaces are breeding grounds for illicit activities, and funds originating from these platforms are often linked to illegal operations. The movement of such a large sum raises concerns about: Money Laundering: This could be an attempt to launder cryptocurrency earned through illegal activities on the Nucleus marketplace. Moving the funds to new wallets can be a step in obscuring the original source of the money. Proceeds of Crime: The Bitcoin in this wallet likely represents proceeds from illegal drug sales and other illicit activities that took place on Nucleus. Regulatory Scrutiny: Such large movements of funds from wallets associated with dark web marketplaces will undoubtedly attract the attention of law enforcement and regulatory bodies. Challenges and Implications of Dormant Crypto Wallet Reactivations This event highlights several challenges and broader implications within the cryptocurrency ecosystem: Tracing Illicit Funds: While blockchain technology provides transparency, tracing funds linked to illegal activities, especially after long periods of dormancy and multiple transactions, can be complex and resource-intensive. Regulatory Gaps: The case underscores the ongoing challenges in regulating cryptocurrencies and preventing their use in illicit activities, particularly those originating from dark web marketplace operations. Security and Transparency: It raises questions about the long-term security and transparency of cryptocurrency holdings, especially those linked to controversial or illegal origins. Reputational Risk: Events like this can contribute to a negative perception of cryptocurrencies, associating them with illegal activities and crypto money laundering , despite the legitimate uses and advancements in the space. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn? While the exact reasons behind this wallet reactivation remain a mystery, there are some actionable insights we can glean: Vigilance in Blockchain Monitoring: Blockchain analytics firms like Arkham Intelligence play a crucial role in monitoring and detecting unusual activities, helping to bring transparency to the crypto space. Importance of Regulatory Compliance: For legitimate crypto businesses and users, maintaining strict compliance with regulations is crucial to distance themselves from illicit activities and maintain the integrity of the ecosystem. Enhanced Due Diligence: Exchanges and financial institutions dealing with cryptocurrencies need to enhance their due diligence processes to identify and flag potentially suspicious transactions, especially those involving older or dormant wallets. Continued Development of Tracing Tools: Further development and refinement of blockchain tracing and analysis tools are essential to combat crypto money laundering and track illicit funds effectively. Conclusion: Unraveling the Crypto Mystery The reactivation of this dormant crypto wallet linked to the Nucleus dark web marketplace is a stark reminder of the complex and sometimes shadowy underbelly of the cryptocurrency world. The movement of $77.5 million after nine years of silence is not just a financial transaction; it’s a narrative unfolding, hinting at untold stories of the past and raising critical questions about the future of digital finance, regulation, and the ongoing battle against illicit activities in the crypto space. As the Bitcoin makes its way through new wallets, the crypto community and law enforcement agencies will be watching closely, hoping to unravel the mystery behind this digital awakening.
